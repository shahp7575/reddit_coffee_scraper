Christmas is coming up and every past Christmas we’ve bought him no brainers like coffee mugs and because he’s a big cologne guy a cologne he doesn’t have. Every year it’s the same thing nothing new so I want to change it a bit and get him something different. 

Because he loves fragrances, something related to them could work I just don’t know what. 

I’m really just looking for some suggestions, nothing so expensive, i’ve looked at all those websites, “50 best gifts for dads.” But it’s all generic things. For final information, he likes cologne, works in more hands on construction not much big machines, and loves plants. 

I hope this post can help myself along with others struggling to find gifts. ",1,1765674166.0,Gifts,1,1.0,False

1pm1571,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1pm1571/synchronized_poorly/,"Synchronized, poorly.","It was after midnight when I went into the Denny’s. Not because I was hungry, exactly, but because the night had gone hollow and I needed a place where the lights stayed on no matter what. The parking lot was mostly empty. A semi idled far off, breathing like a tired animal.

Inside, everything smelled faintly of coffee and disinfectant. The waitress nodded without interest and poured me a cup before I asked. I chose a booth near the window. Outside, the world looked paused, like a scene waiting for someone to remember to press play.

That’s when the stranger sat across from me.

He did not ask permission. He simply appeared, already settled, hands folded on the table as if we were in the middle of a conversation that had started elsewhere. He wore a plain jacket, the kind that could belong to any decade if you didn’t look too closely. His hair was neatly combed, but in a way that suggested he had learned how from a picture, not a mirror.

“You chose a good night,” he said. “This one doesn’t echo much.”

He spoke carefully. Each sentence sounded assembled, not spoken. As though he selected words from a shelf and placed them in order, checking for balance.

I waited for him to explain himself. He didn’t.

Instead, he studied the laminated menu like it contained instructions meant only for him. After a long time, he said, “In most versions of this place, the eggs are better.”

I asked him what he meant by most versions.

He smiled politely, the way someone does when you ask about a topic you have not studied enough to discuss. “It’s hard to describe without sounding dishonest,” he said. “And I try not to do that anymore.”

The waitress came. He ordered coffee but asked for it to be brought later, when it would matter more. She wrote this down without comment, which struck me as strange. When she left, he leaned back and looked at the ceiling tiles.

“They always use these,” he said. “The pattern is comforting. Even when everything else changes.”

I told him he talked like someone translating his own thoughts.

“That’s close,” he said. “But not quite accurate.”

We sat in silence. The coffee cooled between my hands. Somewhere behind the kitchen wall, a radio played a song I almost recognized.

After a while, I asked him if he was a time traveler.

He stirred his coffee, though it had not arrived yet. The motion was precise, practiced. “That’s a dramatic way to put it,” he said. “I prefer to think of myself as poorly synchronized.”

I pressed him. Gently. He did not resist, but he did not give ground either.

“If I admitted it,” he said, “then I would also have to admit why. And that part never sounds reasonable.”

He told me odd things after that. How some nights repeat themselves with minor corrections. How certain people disappear not because they are gone, but because they arrive too early somewhere else. How diners like this one exist as soft places in time, where things bend slightly, the way spoons do when left too long in hot tea.

When the waitress returned, she placed his coffee in front of him. It was steaming.

“Perfect timing,” he said, genuinely pleased.

He drank it slowly, as if measuring something invisible. Then he stood.

“I should go,” he said. “This version of you needs to be alone again.”

I watched him walk toward the door. Halfway there, he turned back.

“For what it’s worth,” he added, “you always choose the booth by the window. That part stays consistent.”

Then he left.

I sat there for a long time after that, listening to the quiet hum of the lights. The coffee tasted the same as always. Outside, the semi was gone.

When I finally paid and stepped back into the night, it felt slightly misaligned. Not wrong. Just off by a fraction.

If you're not that much into reading, then this post is probably not for you, or if you want, you can skip to the end for a short recap/version.



I have already made a couple of posts here, and this one probably won't be my last. What I’ve realized along the way is that I haven’t always known what kind of person I was even looking for. Luckily, thanks to the help of some amazing people, I was able to keep moving toward that answer.

I like figuring things out. Finding problems, puzzles, or situations and slowly working through them is something I genuinely enjoy. It’s also part of why I want a relationship where we can help each other grow and solve things together, even with the small everyday stuff.

I want to find someone where we can support each other, go through things together, help each other figure stuff out, and just… be there for each other. I want to be someone who can actually help their partner because I’ve been working on myself and reaching my goals, and I want to use that to give someone else some support too. Not in a perfect, dramatic way, just normal, everyday kind of support.

But of course, communication is important. When it comes to things like small talk, I'll be the first to admit that I'm really bad at that. I’m a much bigger fan of deep conversations, which is part of why this turned into a massive wall of text. I also find it hard to message others or find the right words. That said, it doesn’t mean every message you send has to be this long. Even a simple “hi” is more than enough. It might take me a little time to get started, but I’ll do my best to respond and keep the conversation going.



  
  
Recap: I'm looking for someone ideally between 20-30 from the EU

About Me:

* Some quick stats: 26M from **Slovenia**, 5'9, introverted, and not into drinking, smoking, or even coffee
* Most days I’m working on editing videos or relaxing with games, anime, manga, or chatting with a friend
* I’m more of a listener than a talker at first, ~~small talk isn't my thing~~, but I like deeper conversations once I’m comfortable (I prefer voice chats over texts, and I mainly use **Discord**)
* I play pretty much all genres of games (PC + Switch), but I love puzzle and strategy games the most, anything that makes me think (I don’t really like horror games ^(<-scary) )
* I’m quiet but observant, so I tend to notice things even if I don’t say much
* Always trying to improve and figure myself out a bit more
* Also, I like **Pokémon**, *just putting that out there*

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

**About Me** 

5'6 170lb Athletic Build, East Asian American, ESFJ. I currently live in the Boston surrounding area but am open to other parts of the U.S, preferably East Coast if we do connect. I work in a remote role in Academia so my location is flexible. I live a healthy lifestyle where i'm a mix of a homebody and active, though i lean more towards being a homebody. I'm super optimistic/independent/cultured and am mostly seeking someone similar, preferably you've gone through your healing phase and have your life put together. 

**Interests**

I absolutely love learning and is someone that will always try something once. I could go on and on about my interests but would rather save that for a separate conversation. I'm the type of person that would join you for hot yoga, pilates, glass blowing, pottery, sky diving, board games, cooking class, etc. 

A short list of my interests but not limited to: Cooking, foodie, cocktails/beers, hiking/nature/mountains, coffee/matcha, concerts/live performances/musicals, boardgames, thriller/comedy/action movies, sunsets/sunrises, solo trips (over 15+ countries so far, would love to travel with a SO), reading, kpop/cpop and dramas, gym, etc. I'm sure we're bound to have something in common. 

**Dealbreakers**

Strict Dietary preferences (I'm sorry but I love to try new food and if you have strict preferences, it won't work out long-term)

Politics (I lean democrat/liberal but try to avoid political discussions)

Religious (I'm okay if you're religious as long as you don't push it onto others)

I do believe physical attraction is as important as emotional, so i would prefer if we share SFW photos early. Feel free to shoot me a message if you think we would connect.",1,1765673913.0,amwfdating,0,1.0,False

After a banana, morning coffee, and a kiss to my wife I was out the door. She tried asking more about baby stuff but I just couldn’t talk about it, there was a job to be done and in all honesty, I have been avoiding the subject. How could the tooth belong to someone from that long ago? Was the tooth a namesake of John's family? I am unfamiliar with Native American customs when it comes to holding on to something like teeth. Maybe it was a way to honor their ancestors. Too many questions and not enough answers. When I arrived, Carson was waiting outside the department for me. We walked in together. He was rubbing his eye.

“How are you able to drink as much as you do and not call out of work?” Carson asked.

“I think my dad's side of the family was Scottish or Irish"" I replied with a wink. Which was bullshit because to my knowledge I am mostly Welsh and English. Who cares, same island.

“That would explain your stupidity; you make your ancestors proud” Carson giggled with immediate regret as I could tell his head cracked from it.

When we got to forensics Kim came up to me looking a bit shaken. I asked her to see what was going on but she was inconsolable. Kim was a 66 year old woman who chain smoked. Worked for BPD for 30 years, a true rock in the department. I never thought I would see the day where she was shaken up by a piece of evidence. All she said to us was “It’s gone.”

When we tried to press her as to what she meant she finally clarified. According to Kim the tooth was in more or less good condition. Besides the blood on it, not a single mark or erosion was indicated when we brought it to her the night before. Kim went on to state as soon as she radiocarbon dated the tooth and got the results it dissolved in front of her eyes. She had never seen anything like it before.

So now we were left with no evidence left. Only knowledge that the tooth existed to begin with and how old it was dated to. Kim stated she would stand under oath and swear to the tooth's existence once we caught the suspect. I thanked her for her work and told Kim to get some rest. Carson and I took our leave.

“So now what?” Carson asked.

“Let's pay John a visit. Maybe he’s got some ideas.” I replied.

“We don’t even know if the tooth had anything to do with the murder or the kid's disappearance.”

“Maybe, but remember the way the wounds looked on Natalie? Or Tallulah Birdinground from two weeks ago? We thought a hack saw was the weapon but couldn't it also look like biting? I mean you saw the tooth right? The thing was sharp to the touch and it certainly didn’t feel like it was 400 years old.”

“Well I guess we got nothing else going for us”. Carson said in an annoyed tone.

Carson is relatively fresh to homicide. He started about two years ago and has been my partner since his first day. I am three years older than Carson so the partnership has truly been more of a friendship and outside of my wife and immediate family, I am unsure if I consider anyone closer to me than Carson. However, Carson is impatient, and the job has taken a toll on him like it would any sane person. Although Carson is only three years younger than me I started homicide when I was 28, I am 36 now. I have been in this game far longer and after a while, with enough compartmentalization, the job becomes nothing more than that, a job. It can’t be anything else, or you go mad. Right now, for Carson, it’s everything.

I called John and he gave us the address of his brother Red’s house. When we arrived we were greeted by a scrawny 20 something year old. It was John’s brother Red. Red told us he would be back in an hour and he was going to take the opportunity to run to the store while we were here. He has been unable to leave John out of his sight in fear John would kill himself. We said we would hang here until he returned and he thanked us.

“Was there really nothing other than her torso? Natalie was like my sister, I just never thought something like... this.” Red asked quietly.

“I’m real sorry. Best not dwell on it. We’ll find the bastard that did this.” I answered.

“Thanks. Anyway, I’ll try to make it quick. We can talk more when I get back.” Red left in a hurry.

When we entered the home the smell of booze stung the nostril. While Red was able to hold John back from killing himself, it was apparent he couldn’t keep him away from alcohol.  John was laying on the couch with a handle of vodka empty on the coffee table. Still inebriated he tried his best to engage in conversation in a far friendlier manner than last night, I was unsure if he is genuinely more hopeful or if it was the vodka talking.

“What can I do to assist you, detective?” John said in slurred speech.

“John, we found a tooth at the base of the stairs last night. It was covered in blood. We thought it might have belonged to the suspect before we ended up age dating it. Turns out the tooth belonged to someone who lived near 400 years ago. John, did the tooth belong to you or your wife? Maybe a family heirloom?”

“I don’t know if I know any Indian who would be weird enough to hold onto a tooth from a potential ancestor so no, and my wife never mentioned anything about a tooth.” John sarcastically remarked.

“What about the feather sticking out of her chest” blurted Carson.

“What? What feather?” John stated with a sudden seriousness that caught us off guard.

I darted a glance at Carson as I deliberately withheld that information out of fear that John would further blame himself. Especially since he is higher risk but since John’s currently being watched closely by Red I guess it's the best we got right now. The tooth came up blank but John’s curiosity and sobering seriousness led me to believe it was our best shot.

“It was an eagle feather, protruding from her chest. It was, besides the dismemberment, how we were able to connect the murder of Tallulah Birdinground from two weeks ago to this one.” Carson answered.

“You guys should leave. I don’t want you guys to get in over your head with this.” John stated.

“That's ridiculous John. Whether you like it or not this is our case, and it's your kid on the line. Let us help you. Besides, if you're withholding something from us, that won’t look fondly on you. Who might I add, is our primary suspect if we can’t find anything else.” I stated firmly.

“Fine ya bastard.” John snarked.

He continued, “Listen, some people from my tribe told stories. Dumb stories, to scare children to make sure they listened to their elders. That if they misbehaved they would be taken and their mothers would be eaten up. I never believed it until someone on the reservation when I was a kid lost his wife and child sixteen years back. The feather was lodged in the wife's chest. If what you tell me is true and you refuse to give up, then me and Red can take you to the old chief of tribal police at our reservation. If he’s still around anyway. Last I heard he lives in the Bear Tooth pass. Maybe I got the facts wrong but he could tell you what happened.”

“That's a start.” I replied.

Do I believe in supernatural occurrences? Well, I do believe in God, so I guess that would mean yes. However, despite being a man of faith I have always tried to keep my job in objective reality, what I could see and what I could control. Was there some monster that took these women's lives and took their children? In my mind no. The only monsters that exist in my line of work are manmade. My mind began to drift to the first case... Keenan. However, this was our best shot at catching the culprit and if this story is true maybe the murder at the tribe sixteen years ago is the same man who killed John’s wife.

Once Red returned, we filled him in on the details and agreed to meet with Chief of the tribal police, Paco HoldsTheEnemy in two days that Friday. We shook hands and John shared a look with me that I can only describe as mutual respect, a far better start then how we initially met. John is a good man, I can tell. It was a shot in the dark but it was all that we had. The rest of Carson and my day was filled with paperwork on the second phantom murder in the same month. 

The department was starting to put the pressure down on us to find someone to convict, even if that meant John. You have to understand that in a town the size of Billings, serial killers are the talk of the town. That coupled with department politics, and pressures from the press, there is not much room for failure. Wouldn’t want to make the department look bad. I just hope Paco held onto some evidence from back then. Otherwise I might have to try and convict a grieving father. Is that justice?

That night my wife ordered a pizza (pregnancy cravings). We cuddled and watched our show since I didn’t have any late night dismemberment calls. Nights like this made me think that it was time for me to transfer to less dangerous and less busy work. When it was just me and her, it was perfect. We called it quits around 9 PM and when I’m able to catch as many Zzz’s as I can, I do. Sleep isn’t guaranteed anymore.

I had another dream. This one longer. The same one, accept this time John was with me. We both fell into the snow. In the distance that same thing was there. This time sprint-crawling at us. I heard the singing again but this time it was different words from the first dream.



*“Crow child, beware the red-painted face,*

*She walks between worlds, she leaves not a trace.*

*If she calls you at night from the cottonwood tree,*

*Don’t follow her voice — or you’ll never be free.”*



I started looking around to see the voices. When I turned around, I saw three Native children in a shrub about 20 yards away. They were the ones singing. The choir. When I turned to tell John, I saw whatever was crawling at us grab him by the ankle, its face covered by John's lower-body but it had to be over 8 feet tall. It dragged him back where it came from and it was John’s screams that finally woke me from my dream. When I woke up I was sweating. I checked my phone and saw I got a text from Carson. To my shock and horror. The text said bluntly:

“John’s dead. Red called in to report it. Hung himself. He left a message for you. Get down here.”

- What is better: cake or pie?

- What is the better movie: Volcano or Dante's Peak?

- Why is it socially unacceptable to pick a wedgie?

I see these types of comments on all kinds of things.

Runway looks?

 ""Who's wearing that?"" Or ""it looks ridiculous!"" 

Well, it's not for everyday wear. It's for a fashion show, which is just an art show where the art is worn. It's to showcase the designer's skill, and also often show extremes of the themes that will be in their collection that is for people to buy and wear.

Crazy elaborate long nails with things behind resin casing or pieces glued on top?

""Hurr durr, how do they wipe their ass?"" Or ""Obviously they're unemployed""

No, it's the nail artist showcasing what they can do. It's either just for photo/video to show how skilled they are, OR it could be for a nail competition. They're not expecting the person they just spent 10 hours meticulous painting to go eat bbq ribs and chicken wings before hitting their construction job.

1pm0yfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/1pm0yfk/finished_basement_available_for_rent_in_north/,Finished Basement Available For Rent In North Greece,"I am renting the finished portion of my basement out, it is roughly 280 sqft and carpeted. It's warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer. 

The basement comes with a three seat sofa, coffee table, wooden desk, poker table (if wanted), and a large storage space in the room that goes back into the wall. I can also provide a bed if wanted/needed and that can be discussed. 

I tend to keep the house cool in the winter. The basement has a functioning wood burning stove that I will have cleaned and inspected before you move in that you can use to heat the space as warm as you'd like. 

The entire house is a 3 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom home in north Greece near the intersection of latta and long pond. It's located on a quiet no outlet street about one minute from the expressway. 

You will have your own private full bathroom on the second floor of the home and also access to the half bath on the first floor of the home. The kitchen has new appliances and a gas range available for you to use. Most communal spaces will be available for your use as well. There is a den with a functional gas fireplace. 

The other half of the basement is an old ballet room with a treadmill I use for my cardio and a new washer and dryer for your use as well. I don't go to the unfinished side of the basement outside of using the treadmill, laundry, and the occasional time I need a tool. 

There is an attached garage and both driveway and street parking. Though garage parking is not typically available as I have a golf simulator in the garage you are welcome to use with me if you're an avid golfer. The backyard is fenced in and private containing a pergula with lights, grill, smoker, and working hot tub you are able to use. 

I'm happy to go over additional rules and more about the house during a private tour. 

I work from home and am a fairly quiet homebody. Ideally you are similar and we can mesh well together. 

Cats (and possibly small cage animals) are allowed if they stay in the basement the majority of time. There will be an additional $50 a month for pet fees though. 

The base rent is $1000 a month and includes all utilities and repairs. I will need to see either proof of funds for six months rent or two most recent paystubs of at least $1250 biweekly. 

If you would be interested in learning more or seeing the space please send me a DM with some basic information about yourself (age, job/school, gender) and what kind of lease term you're looking for.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

For some background: in my early 20s, I had a crush freshman year of college. She was part of a large friend group, and the group would talk at night or go eat meals at the food hall. I mustered my courage one day and asked her out.  It went bad - without a big story, it traumatized me and made me take on a rule of ""I don't ask women unless I'm 110% sure they would appreciate being asked by me"" I've been in therapy to work this out, but therapy is an ongoing path.

On to the story:
I joined a group during the middle of this year. After the group activity, some of us head to do a group dinner, 6 to 20 people in size. One of the members is a woman I was quickly attracted to. I saw her at several of these group dinners, sometimes her sitting across from me or right next, and would share conversation.
On one night, she arrived late and ordered food late. The group started to wrap up as she was in the middle of her meal. There was discussion of handing around and keeping her company, which unpredictably turned out to be just me keeping her company.
We sat and ate, talking and learning about each other. It was a nice discussion, no rush to finish, and wrapped up organically.  We walked out of the restaurant, waved goodbye.
I have seen her a few times since, and things have still been fine, and status quo.

The question:
Should I have proposed meeting for coffee in the future, or did I make the right decision in keeping quiet?

She's been with the group longer than I have, and I didn't want it to be something she felt uncomfortable attending because I changed a dynamic.

I know it can't always be a straightforward answer, but I'm trying to understand if I have some incorrect programming still going on from my past trauma.",2,1765672755.0,datingoverforty,7,0.75,False

I use the computer mostly for gaming. Here's some specs:

850W power supply  
z390 AORUS ELITE motherboard  
intel i5 9600k coffee lake   
Water cooled!  
RTX 3070ti (I know)  
an awkward 24GB DDR4 in 3/4 slots

It seems to me like I'm mostly running into issues with my CPU, watching it top out sometimes while I'm playing certain games. RAM is really expensive right now because of all the AI companies buying it up, so I'm hesitant to get different RAM and if I did, I'd probably only go up to 32GB because I will likely not need any more than that. 

I did a little of my own research, and if I upgraded my CPU I would go for an i7 9700k, or an i9 9900k since the board supports 8th and 9th gen chips. My concerns are with power allocation, since I'm not sure if my 850W will be enough to run the i9. I checked and the motherboard has the VRM to run it, so I'm good on that front. Is it worth getting a new motherboard?

I'm not so concerned about money as much as I am about getting the most value out of whatever I end up buying. I've spent money on crap parts in the past when I was still brand new to PCs, so really just looking to make sure whatever I get works well.

“It’s a sauna in there,” Space Sergeant Butch Calhoun muttered as he emerged from the Myung-ho Chae Recreation Facility (MCRF) into the sterile darkness of the hyper-filtered air.

Why was there a recreation facility named after Myung-ho Chae? Well, he was a Cosmic Corps legend. A planetary engineer serving in the early days, he was heroically crushed to death by twenty-seven tons of paper files while conducting an inspection based on the rumor of an improperly formatted decimal point sometime in 2037.

The Cosmic Corps Ball, which occurred deca-biannually, was winding down; it was almost time to start planning the next one in eighteen days. Orbiters, as the personnel of the Cosmic Corps were called, spent fifty-four percent of their time planning events. Butch removed his “throwback” suit jacket, which made him look like a low-budget airline pilot, and his starched dress shirt and hung them on the railing beside the building’s back exit. He intended to return for them later, but never did.

Butch had made a responsible decision to walk back to his quarters, as he had a few too many foams. Beer was too heavy to regularly transport from Earth, so Orbiters drank foam. It was a beverage made locally from fermenting a mash of a bioluminescent moss, which was the only vegetation on Glozanth IX, a Class-M-Questionable planet located in the Snörple Drift, a chaotic star cluster infamous for failed experiments. The closest taste an Earthling could associate it with would be wasabi.

He wasn’t far from the MCRF when someone shouted out.

“Hey, stop!”

A skinny, pale, blond Orbiter in an orange and teal Class Beta uniform bearing a rank junior to Butch’s urgently ran up to him.

“You’re in breach of Cosmic Corps Regulation Manual 94X-3A!” he shouted at Butch, and stood on his toes to get a better look.

“And you’re intoxicated! You’re a danger to yourself and others!”

The junior Orbiter wrapped his arms around Butch and attempted to pick him up. Butch was burly, strapping even, and didn’t budge when the young Orbiter tried to apprehend him. Butch put “Drizzle”, at least that was the name embroidered on his uniform, into a headlock. He was deciding whether to let Drizzle go, or to rough him up to teach him a lesson, when he was interrupted by more shouting.

“Hey!”

A group of three Orbiters had been walking down the same sidewalk several hundred feet behind Drizzle, and saw him in Butch’s clutches. Butch wasn’t about to let Drizzle go, but he saw what he thought was a foam-induced apparition… Drizzle licked his own eyeball.

Butch was trying to understand what he was seeing as the footsteps of the other Orbiters rapidly approached, then he felt the cold, slimy sensation of Drizzle licking his arm. Butch instinctively threw him onto the ground in a heap at the feet of the other Orbiters who had arrived to rescue him.

Such a display could only mean one thing: this guy was a Zarv in disguise.

The Zar’Vokian were mankind’s mortal enemy in the galaxy, a bipedal lizard-like race. It all started centuries ago, an incident that has been mythologized in Zar’Vokian folklore as “The Great Slight of Zar’Vok-Tuun.” A simple misunderstanding during the First Contact Summit on the neutral moon Diplomia-9, a human ambassador accidentally served ranch dressing to the Zar’Vokian diplomat Zar’Vok-Tuun, who had explicitly requested “the creamy white sauce made of fermented spores and crushed lava hornets.”

The result was instant purging for Zar’Vok-Tuun; more plainly, public diarrhea. The humans laughed, the Zar’Vokians vowed revenge.

What humans saw as a “harmless mix-up,” the Zar’Vokians viewed as an unforgivable spiritual desecration of their sacred gut biome. Unlike traditional warfare, the Zar’Vokians believe in “a thousand humiliations over one clean kill.”

Their tactics had thus far been: swapping salt with sugar in the Myng-ho Chae (a different Myung-ho Chae) Chow Hall (MCCH), adjusting all the chairs to be slightly too low, replacing caffeinated coffee with decaffeinated coffee, reprogramming base AI assistants to refer to the Orbiters as “toots”, and secretly installing bidets that announce “shame detected!” when used.

Each successful infiltration was followed by a ritual celebration, during which human prisoners of war are forced to wear giant fruit-shaped hats while having their buttocks gently whipped by the tails of Zar’Vokians circled around them in a conga line during a communal dance, while the event is broadcast to the Zar’Vokian Parliament, who hiss in approval while sipping from tiny mugs.

“He’s a Zarv spy,” Butch said plainly, pointing to Drizzle.

Drizzle whined as the other Orbiters helped him to his feet.

“He’s a crazy drunk!” Drizzle pointed accusingly at Butch.

“Whoa, calm it down Orbiter. We don’t need to be put on lockdown, just go sleep it off,” one of the strangers cautioned Butch, while another summoned the Cosmic Cops from his watch.

Orbiters wore watches that could make phone calls; they also monitored their blood sugar and video game usage. Orbiters were required to play video games for forty-two hours a week; it helped keep their testosterone and interest in the opposite, or same, sex to a minimum, giving them more time to plan parties.

Butch turned around to walk away, but before he could take more than a few steps the lights and sirens of two Cosmic Cops zipping to the scene on hover-cycles overtook him. They asked no questions. They simply blasted the group with an energy net, rendering them helpless, and dragged them to the Myung-ho Chae Law Enforcement Center (MCLEC) to sort it out.

They quickly determined that Butch was the primary suspect and put him into a cell alone. He did the only thing he knew to do in confinement, push-ups and various calisthenics.

Drizzle feigned dizziness and fell to his hands and knees, exaggerating his non-existent injuries while the others gave statements to the Cosmic Cops. One ran to get a pain reliever and water, the other ran to get a tourniquet, and in the confusion Drizzle, who was in fact a Zarv infiltrator, slinked out of the MCLEC and into the night.",1,1765672499.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I started drinking matcha earlier in the year and am hooked. I’m trying to replace coffee because of all of matcha’s benefits... and honestly how much better I feel on it. I bought a big bag of matcha feeling confident, and now I’m standing in my kitchen completely lost on what combinations actually work. I know I like matcha slightly sweet, but nothing overpowering. I still want that earthy, grassy matcha flavor to come through, not get buried under sugar or syrups.

I’ve tried a few flavored single-serve matcha packets I found online and had good luck with those, which is what pushed me to buy a bag of raw matcha. Now I want to start experimenting with my own combinations.

I’m looking for beginner-friendly, real-life kitchen combinations using ingredients people actually have. Milk or regular oat milk is preferred for me. Honey vs maple vs sugar? Any natural flavor syrups you might recommend? Are there any specific ratios you use that are easy to measure out?

1pm0fnp,https://i.redd.it/e8ggowjfd27g1.jpeg,Reze is the Best Work of Tatsuki Fujimoto,"I am in Love with REZE, So here's an Analysis

Since watching the Reze Arc movie, she has been living in mind Rent Free and i think this Over-Analysis would help me deal with the loss of One of the best/most Tragic characters in Fiction.

After being in Love with the Worlds biggest Manipulator, Denji meets a girl in the rain. Her name is Reze. She has beautiful green eyes. Reze played the role of a Regular ""GIRL"" to provide a fake sense of security to Denji just to steal Chainsaw Devil's heart, though in this process she might have found her own heart.

Reze is a name found commonly in France and Russia, which is obvious since she turns out to be a BADASS SOVIET KILLING MACHINE. Its clear she was inspired by Matilda from the Movie : Leon the Professional. Both character have similar clothing styles, distinct chokers. and backstories. Both didn't had normal childhoods and were trained to kill.

The BOMB Devil's design is one of the best works of Fujimoto. It encapsulates all the fears people have about bombs. From her skirt being made of Dynamite, her entire arms and chest made of bundles of fuses and of course her Menacing Head. Reze has even deeper connections to the Darkness Devil. During our introduction we see A bell ringing in the darkness on Reze's T-shirt. This bell also appears on one of the swords of the Darkness Devil during the International Assassins Arc.

Reze is Exceptionally stronger than other Hybrids and Fiends since most likely the Cold War is not over in the CSM Universe and both Soviet Union and USA are still Beefing. Which creates fears of bombs and imminent conflict in the minds of the people. Since in the CSM Universe Nuclear Weapons don't exist, the fear of Bombs is still immense.

I don't even know if he consciously knows why, but Denji to the cafe goes day after day. He drinks coffee he doesn't like and takes time out of his life to visit Reze. They talk, they share, they laugh. later Reze invited him on a kind of date to her what she claimed to be school. The date begins with both of them holding hands and bonding over Denji not being able to live a life similar to a Regular 16 yr old.

Here comes the most BEAUTIFUL Animated Scenes i have ever watched. The two of them go to a pool and go swimming. I can talk about this scene for hours about the colors, the blocking, the composition, the art, the sound in every medium that it exists. but let's keep it short and just say it was \*\*ABSOLUTE CINEMA\*\*. This feeling is one I too understand. I know many of you do too. That feeling of everything in a moment being perfect, locking into place, working. That feeling when you are with someone and your body stops aching, your mind stops worrying, you stop feeling fear, concern, the pain of being a human being, where the world outside falls away and it's just you and her or you and him alone. It's a perfect moment for me at least. It was here when both Denji and Reze truly started to love each other. And it hurts all the more because of it.

Reze choking the Serial Killer in the rain was the moment when the stakes were raised and i was sold on Reze as the Prime Antagonist of this Arc. The Poem narrated in Russian is not something specific but this scene is a reference to the Movie : No Country For Old Men.

I think both the Confession and Plea to runaway by Reze were genuine, yet after Denji denies and continues wanting to be a City Mouse Reze truly wants to take Chainsaw Man's Heart. Denji and Reze Kissing under the Fireworks was so Fucking Poetic, Fireworks are generally regarded as a Symbol of Passion and Love but they gain a Sinister meaning after the betrayal and the appearance of the Bomb Devil.

They both Fight. It is as spectacular and magical as any artistic rendition of violence I have seen. Isn't this what LOVE is ? obsessive, quiet, perfect, explosive, violent, and fiery. It's something so volatile it cannot be controlled. And yet, it is so completely, utterly, absolutely, resolutely irresistible. I think sometimes this is how Love works it pulls you in and burns you. It rips you apart and mangles you and then it leaves. I'm afraid that one day someone is going to come along and love me like that and I will not be able to control myself as I fly into the fire. At the same time, it's also terrifying that that won't ever happen, that you won't ever feel that. Because I think sometimes that maybe I'm not capable of that.

During the End of the fight Chainsaw Man hugged the Bomb Devil as they sunk to the bottom of the Sea because Denji saw through Reze's Lie and believed she also loved him. Therefore he told Reze to him at the Cafe at Noon to Runaway.

Even though knowing that Makima is listening and that she will not let Denji leave, Reze still returns to cafe ultimately realising her Feelings. But it was too late Makima plays her hand and ultimately Kills Reze.

I think any one Under Makima's control effectively becomes a City Mouse because she offers them the Delicious Food but Reze was A Country Mouse since she desired to live a Peaceful life away from the City probably with Denji.

The Reze Arc was a Calm, Tender, Quiet, Real, take on Denji's Life and how it could have been if it was not set in the world of CSM. Reze was a Mirror to Denji's life as both had shared similar Traumas and were both mere Tools, Killing Machines for there Owners. Being a Hopeless Romantic I hoped for something better but

I wanted to ask the group here a question but I need to tell you a little bit of background first and probably some people here had similar experiences. Sorry in advance for the long post 💙

I got two epilepsy seizures back in the day when I was 18 years old. The two seizures were at the same day. A few weeks when I started taking an anti depressant and during some stressful period of my life. I had EEG after and it was tonic clonic generalised epilepsy. 

I had tegretol for 3 years after and never had seizures. I decreased the dose afterwards and I was off meds for 15 years afterwards with no seizures at all. During which I was a heavy drinker of coffee, alcohol, used some recreational drugs even from time to time.

In the past few months I had a burnout due to work issues and then I was prescribed citalopram (anti depressant) again a few weeks after I had the same seizures again twice in 1 week. I started following up with the neurologist but I still cannot get my head around what triggers the epilepsy seizures.  Would it be the stress or can the anti depressant can be a trigger on their own?

We were both pregnant at the same time. We became quite close and spent a lot of time together at baby classes and having general meet ups over lunch and coffee. However, every single time my baby has been poorly - and it has been a lot recently as her baby has started nursery - it has been from this friend/her baby.

The kicker is.. She will only tell me half way through an outing that her baby has been or is currently poorly. This has ranged from telling me she has an awful cold whilst we’ve been at soft play to telling me her family have had Norovirus recently whilst I’m already at her house - I got it the next day and I am terrified of vomit.

Her baby always seem to be unwell which is upsetting but she will NOT stay at home when her baby is poorly so I think she perhaps isn’t  given the opportunity to properly recover before being exposed to the next illness?

It’s so frustrating as sometimes she does tell us her baby is poorly but she will still attend classes and groups, meaning I then stay at home and isolate to try and keep my baby from becoming unwell. She asked me recently if I will be attending our swimming class as she will be there, after showing us how bad her rash was from hand, foot and mouth just days before.

The reason I ask if I’m overreacting is because, I know babies do get poorly often. It’s just so frustrating as I know it’s from her/her baby and she doesn’t stay at home. Is this not a thing anymore? Am I in the wrong? I want to say something but it seems rude.

I’m current sat with my poorly baby on my lap :( she’s got a cold after seeing this friend yesterday who told me about an hour into our coffee date that her baby has a cold 😩

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I understand this is a rough time of year for many people so I've come to not expect much but I got my hopes up for my husband.

I had been sending him links and screenshots of things I would like for my birthday since the beginning of November. Not crazy expensive stuff but reasonable stuff. A cheap record player, a few tshirts, hoodies from some of my favorite brands, cheap handbags etc. I even saw a cake that I thought was beautiful and sent him a picture of it and said I would like a cake like this. A red velvet cake with black icing topped with red fruit. It sang to my spooky heart. It didn't have to be exact but it was inspiration.

I wake up this morning to him just waking up. I was hoping he would have breakfast and coffee for me at least. 

Ok. No big deal I can wait while he does that for me. Instead he makes us coffee and sits down at the kitchen table and scrolls on his phone. I wait a while then just accept he wasn't going to do it. 

He then asks me if I want my present and I say sure. 
He brings it in and puts it on the table. It's a ugly salmon pink hoodie from the clothing place around the corner from us. I'm a spooky girl and I like my hoodies black. I do like pink from time to time but this shade was just gross.

I tried not to sound ungrateful and thanked him but my heart was in my stomach and I was trying not to cry. He literally waited last minute to get a quick gift from somewhere close and it wasn't even from a place I shop at. I'm not a hard person to shop for. Especially when I've been sending links and wishlist to him. 

I'm still waiting on breakfast. The eggs are out. 

I get the kids up and dressed and to the table I go to cook for the kids and he takes over that at least. I ask about breakfast. 

He says I didn't tell him what I wanted. I've been low carb and high protein for a year now and I have a typical breakfast of eggs and turkey or chicken.  He says he had no idea and I didn't tell him what I wanted. 

So I open the fridge to grab the protein out and see no cake. I was excited to treat myself to a beautiful birthday cake later in the day but I saw no cake. Maybe he was hiding it but I saw ingredients for a cake. He didn't even bother to order me a cake. He was going to make it last minute. 

I couldn't hold it back anymore. I walked into the bathroom and cried. I made the mistake of getting excited for my birthday and now I was heartbroken. This man literally thought about me last minute and slapped together a disappointing birthday the night before after I had been throwing ideas at him for well over a month. I even had to make a reservation at the restaurant I wanted to go to because I was afraid he wouldn't do it in time. Now I'm thinking about cancelling it and just staying home and doing chores on my birthday. Is more than halfway through the day and he hasn't even started the cake he was planning to make. 
I know if I tell him I hate this day he will guilt trip me and make me feel even worse and I just can't deal with that right now.

I'm not materialistic but I expect better from a man I've spent almost 8 years with. It like he's not even trying anymore or not paying attention.  

Tldr: husband of almost 8 years. Quickly slaps together a last birthday for me making be feel like low priority.",4,1765671623.0,JustNoSO,6,1.0,False
1pm0ak2,https://www.reddit.com/r/INFPIdeas/comments/1pm0ak2/loweffort_energy_wins_eliminating_hidden_energy/,Low-Effort Energy Wins: Eliminating Hidden Energy Drains That Add Nothing to Your Life,"Most households quietly bleed energy in ways that add zero value to daily life. When you zoom out across millions of homes, these small, invisible losses add up to massive, unnecessary emissions and costs. The good news is that many of the fastest climate wins don’t require lifestyle sacrifice, major renovations, or buying lots of new stuff. They come from shutting off, downsizing, or replacing things that quietly consume energy while doing almost nothing for you.

Below is a list of common, no-benefit energy drains, along with cost-saving alternatives.


1. Standby Power (“Vampire Load”) 🌼

~ What’s wasted: Devices that draw power even when “off”: TVs, cable boxes, game consoles, sound systems, printers, Wi-Fi extenders, coffee makers with clocks, microwaves with displays, and many older chargers.

~ Easy alternative: Plug these into an energy saving [smart power strip](https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-tech/sustainable/smart-power-strip.htm) and turn them fully off when not in use.

~ Buy used? Yes. Used smart power strips are widely available and perfectly fine.

~ Payback: Often under 1 year, especially for entertainment centers.


2. Second Refrigerators & Freezers 🌼

~ What’s wasted: Garage or basement fridges that are half empty, rarely opened, or holding a few frozen items “just in case.”

~ Easy alternative: Consolidate food into your main fridge or freezer. If extra space is truly needed, replace very old units with a high-efficiency model.

~ Buy used? Sometimes. Look for newer Energy Star models, not older “free” hand-me-downs.

~ Payback: Replacing a 20–30-year-old fridge can pay back in 2–4 years, faster if electricity rates are high.


3. Old Incandescent or Halogen Bulbs 🌼

~ What’s wasted: Up to 90% of energy is lost as heat.

~ Easy alternative: Swap to LED bulbs, focusing first on indoor or outdoor lights used daily.

~ Buy used? No. Buy new LEDs for efficiency and longevity.

~ Payback: Often months, not years.


4. Outdoor Lighting Fixtures That Run All Night 🌼

~ What’s wasted: Decorative or security lighting left on regardless of need.

~ Easy alternative: Motion sensors, timers, or solar lights where appropriate.

~ Buy used? Yes for fixtures and motion sensors.

~ Payback: Usually 1–2 years, faster for high-wattage fixtures.


5. Old Energy-Hog Appliances 🌼

~ What’s wasted: Dishwashers, washers, dryers, or refrigerators from the 1990s or earlier.

~ Easy alternative: Replace the worst offenders first, especially those used frequently.

~ Buy used? Yes - newer efficient models bought used can still cut energy dramatically.

~ Payback: Typically 3–6 years, often faster with rebates and lower water use.


6. Cooling Things That Fight the Environment 🌼

~ What’s wasted: Placing refrigerators, freezers, aquariums, or electronics in direct sun or near heat sources.

~ Easy alternative: Move them to shaded, ventilated locations.

~ Buy used? Not applicable.

~ Payback: Immediate. This costs nothing and saves energy instantly.


7. Leaky Doors, Windows & Attics 🌼

~ What’s wasted: Conditioned air escaping through cracks and poorly sealed spaces.

~ Easy alternative: Weather-stripping, caulking, door sweeps, and attic hatch insulation.

~ Buy used? Sometimes for materials like leftover insulation.

~ Payback: Often 1–3 years, sometimes much sooner.


8. Manual Thermostat Habits 🌼

~ What’s wasted: Heating or cooling empty homes or sleeping households.

~ Easy alternative: Smart thermostats or better daily scheduling.

~ Buy used? Yes. Many are removed during upgrades and resold.

~ Payback: Typically 1–2 years.


9. High-Flow Showerheads & Faucets 🌼

~ What’s wasted: Energy used to heat water that literally goes down the drain.

~ Easy alternative: Full-flow efficient fixtures that maintain pressure while using less water. A mist setting on a showerhead is a great, ultra low flow option for longer showers.

~ Buy used? No for hygiene reasons - buy new.

~ Payback: Often under 1 year.


10. Always-On Internet & Networking Gear 🌼

~ What’s wasted: Multiple routers, extenders, and old modems running 24/7.

~ Easy alternative: Consolidate equipment, upgrade to one efficient device, or power down unused extenders.

~ Buy used? Yes, for newer efficient models, but from a trusted source.

~ Payback: Usually 1–2 years.


11. Laundry Habits 🌼

~ What’s wasted: Hot water washes and constant dryer use.

~ Easy alternative: Cold-water washing and air drying when possible.

~ Buy used? Drying racks are perfect used items.

~ Payback: Immediate and ongoing.


12. Idle Office Equipment 🌼

~ What’s wasted: Desktop computers, monitors, and printers left on overnight.

~ Easy alternative: Sleep settings, smart plugs or smart power strips, or simple shutdown routines.

~ Buy used? Yes for smart plugs and smart power strips, but from a trusted source for wifi enabled plugs.

~ Payback: Usually within months.


13. Decorative or Legacy Electronics 🌼

~ What’s wasted: Old stereos, clocks, or displays plugged in “just because.”

~ Easy alternative: Unplug or retire them.

~ Buy used? Not needed.

~ Payback: Immediate.


14. Inefficient Cooking Equipment 🌼

~ What’s wasted: Old electric ovens used for small meals, or outdated appliances.

~ Easy alternative: Induction cooktops, toaster ovens, or pressure cookers.

~ Buy used? Yes - many lightly used options exist.

~ Payback: Often 1–3 years depending on use.


15. Always-Running Fans & Space Heaters 🌼

~ What’s wasted: Devices compensating for poor insulation or bad layout.

~ Easy alternative: Seal drafts first, then use targeted heating or cooling only when needed.

~ Buy used? Yes, but prioritize safety and newer models.

~ Payback: Often 1 year or less.


The big takeaway 🌼

Most of the fastest energy savings come from removing waste, not adding technology. Before buying anything new, the biggest win is asking: Is this using energy while giving me nothing in return? When millions of households make these small, boring changes, the climate impact is enormous - and the savings show up on monthly bills almost immediately.",4,1765671616.0,INFPIdeas,2,1.0,False

The story begins with me buying a mk7 Fiesta, 1.4TDCI. I paid the grand total of £200, I poured coffee into the engine oil and watched it slowly break down. Made me think that it's basically doing a service, taking a severely corroded, dangerous car off the roads whilst bringing me entertainment, and then scrapping it and making back all my money again.

So, I thought ""Hmmm, what is a truly despicable nugget on the roads that I can pick up for £100-£200, that I can torture and kill slowly, where no one will mourn the loss of that motor vehicle. "" I'm not talking the generic ""Ew, Fiat Multipla looks so uggo"" because they're so ugly they're kinda cool in a weird, cursed way. If they disappeared, people would be kinda sad.

At first, I thought it was because of my asthma and that I wasn’t getting enough oxygen to my brain, which was why I felt so tired all the time. Caffeine didn’t help at all — I could drink coffee and still feel like I was about to faint. The problem is that my job is highly mentally and cognitively demanding, and I have a lot of important responsibilities right now. My health condition has been seriously impairing my daily functioning.

I’ve been to countless doctor appointments over the past two months, and only recently found out that my ferritin level is **4**. I honestly don’t understand how this happened, because I eat a lot of iron-rich food. I’ve been mildly anemic since middle school, but it was always very mild and I felt totally fine back then. I think that was partly because I used to be vegetarian. I’m no longer vegetarian now — I eat a lot of beef, chicken, and other iron-rich foods, including vegetables, and I eat more overall.

I really don’t understand why my ferritin suddenly dropped to 4 and why I started feeling like I was actually dying all of a sudden. The only possible cause I can think of is that I had food poisoning about a month ago, and I’ve felt like this ever since — but I don’t know if that could really explain it.

On one hand, I’m relieved that I finally know what’s wrong with my body. On the other hand, I don’t know whether I should take sick leave. I constantly feel like I’m about to faint, but I also have several very important tasks that I’ve taken initiative on, and I don’t want to miss these career opportunities.

I’m getting an iron infusion in two days, so I’m wondering if I should wait and see how that goes. I wanted to ask:

* How long does it usually take to feel normal again after iron infusion?
* What should I ask my doctor to help identify the underlying cause of such an extremely low ferritin level, especially when my diet seems adequate?
* Should i do physical activities right now?
* I also do not understand how serious it is to have only 4? 

Any insight or shared experiences would really help. Thanks.",3,1765671315.0,Anemic,10,0.8,False

Es bastante molesto venir de Mallorca solo para eso pero el punto es, que la ciudad me parece horrible.
El barrio del Raval, el gótico, las ramblas, están todas llenas de basura, olor a meado, inmigrantes vendiendo droga, hordas de turistas, bicis de Glovo metiéndose en medio de la gente con esa bolsa amarilla ya sucia y desgastada.
El barrio de Sarrià, San Gervasi y Gracia todavía son agradables, aun hay locales, buenos bares de toda la vida con precios normales y no hay bolsas de basura ni vagabundos durmiendo entre cartones.

Lo que es el centro, para mí ha caído totalmente. 
Esos carrefours con cristales reventados con seguridad pakistaní y oleadas de turistas golpeándose unos con otros, israelíes fumando porros en coffee shops ilegales y chavales en chándal y patinete eléctrico dando vueltas a tu alrededor como tiburones mientras inhalas el polvo de la obra número 1457 que te has encontrado en la semana esquivando andamios y cemento fresco son la cereza que corona la tarta.
Un gran porcentaje de los pisos son Airbnb para chavales europeos que vienen a fumarse 3 porros y salir de bares.

Cada vez que tengo que ir a Barcelona me dan ataques de ansiedad. Coches de los mossos con la sirena a toda pastilla, palomas peinándote con las alas, gente gritando, vendiendo hierba, gente durmiendo en las esquinas, iglesias con graffitis, paredes y farolas llenas de pegatinas políticas, estar pendiente de que no se te vea mucho el móvil o la cartera, las mismas tiendas hipsters de ropa de segunda mano una y otra vez...

Después vas a Madrid y no hay color. Todo es diferente. La gente no está tan amargada, hasta te dan los buenos días sin conocerte. El transporte público no huele tan mal y es bueno, las calles están más limpias, escuchas español por la calle en vez de inglés o holandés y hay zonas peatonales en vez de ese extraño sistema de calles de Barcelona que tienes que cruzar una calle llena de Ubers rabiosos para ir de punto A a punto B.",0,1765671088.0,askspain,8,0.42,False
1pm03yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1pm03yn/day_2_of_first_25mg_dose/,Day 2 of first 2.5mg dose,"I just took my first dose of zepbound and I'm honestly so confused...but excited! I need help understanding what to expect, what I should do. How to maximize weight loss and deal with potential symptoms. 

To begin, I am 5'4 and currently weigh 264lbs. I started my weight loss journey on August 12, 2025. Starting weight was 325lbs so I have successfully lost 60lbs in the last 4 months strictly doing a Keto diet, had to show I was committed so I could get on this medication. 
My goal weight is 120–130lbs and I know it will take me a little while and I'm not worried about it. 

What I am worried about is how I should eat on this shot. 

Day 1: 

I had a sugary coffee (before I found out I was approved and the medication was ready)
After taking it I felt sleepy and had acid reflux all day, but I was starving feeling and it was all for carbs. I had a bowl of jojos and some chocolate then I had pizza for dinner and had horrible reflux again...to be fair, pizza usually gives me reflux. Anywho, no more of that anymore. When I went to sleep all I was thinking about was food. 

Day 2 (today): 

I woke up this morning and I wasnt hungry or thirsty but went to the restroom so much its like I took a water pill. My mother came by with a cinnabon and I had two bites of it and then I was fine. Later I thought I was hungry but I wasnt, so I made a coffee that I took two sips of. 
Its fair to note that I have anxiety and the fact that I wasnt hungry was making me anxious, I kept going to the kitchen and would reach for something and then I was like...nah. Its now dinner time and I cant think of what to eat so I get out a small breakfast sandwich...sounds good at the time. I heated it up and the smell just wasnt good and when I saw the grease on it I literally gagged. Said breakfast sandwich is sitting next to me uneaten. I went to the neighbours and they offered me a chicken strip and I ate it so quick and have just been sitting here seemingly full. 


Anywho, I understand that this shot slows digestion and makes you feel full and all that but I imagine I should still make myself eat. What sort of diet do yall recommend or light exercises to do? When do I start seeing weight loss? Actually better yet, does anybody know their 1 month loss?


OH AND ONE MORE THING, one of my needles were bent when I opened the box and I can't take my 4th 2.5mg dose, would it be okay to push to 5mg after just 3 weeks instead of 4? My doctor only gave me a prescription for 2.5mg no refills and 2 refills for 5mg so far and the free one can only be used for an active prescription.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1pm033r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pm033r/my_apple_watch_has_been_recording_me/,My Apple Watch has been recording me.,"Not sure what to make of this, and I could really use some help.

My wife had been on me about my weight for a while. Said I needed to start taking my health seriously — “for our children,” whatever that means.

I didn’t argue. I just started going to the gym after work. Seemed easier than fighting about it.

She was so happy she bought me an Apple Watch for my birthday. Said it would help keep me accountable.

If only she knew what it would record.

It worked great at first. Tracked my workouts. Counted my steps.

Buzzed at me when I sat too long, like a disappointed teacher.

I didn’t mind it. Made me get off the couch for a change.

The part that surprised me was the sleep tracking.

With all this exercise and weight loss, I finally started being more active with my kids again. I started taking them to the park.

I took them a lot. They loved it and so did I, but this is where it gets weird. I met this man at the park, just sort of milling around.

I assumed he was a grandfather or maybe another parent. He seemed nice enough. A little odd, though. He seemed to have trouble breathing.

We started talking and eventually he asked for my name. At the time I thought nothing of it and told him.

I gave him my name and he smiled and just walked off. I had kids to deal with. What did I care?

I forgot how much work having kids, a job, and now the gym really was. While I normally felt pretty good, after a month or so I started getting tired a lot quicker.

The sleep function on the watch was helpful. It tracked my heartbeat, my breathing, and when I was in deep sleep versus light sleep. No clue how it did all of that, but it got the job done.

I was sipping coffee one morning when my wife casually asked me, “Hey, why were you up and moving around at three a.m.?”

“I wasn’t,” I said, with a confused laugh.

“Really? That’s not what your watch is saying.” She sounded a little miffed.

I dismissed her at the time. Tech glitches. Not a big deal. Until it happened a few nights later.

She asked me about it again, this time even more annoyed. I placated her, but I was a little confused myself.

The third time it happened, I decided to take a look at the numbers myself. I figured if I could show her it was just a glitch, she’d relax.

“Sweetheart, you really think I got out of bed and got so worked up at two-thirty in the morning that my heart rate hit one-thirty? Does that really make sense to you?”

What the watch showed was this:

According to it, I’d been awake from 2:27 to just after 3:00 a.m. Not restless. Awake. My heart rate didn’t spike and drop like you’d expect if I’d just rolled over or had a bad dream — it stayed elevated the entire time, hovering between 120 and 130 beats per minute.

My breathing rate was up too. Fast and uneven, the way it usually gets when I’m halfway through a hard set at the gym.

The movement graph didn’t show pacing or steps, just long stretches of sustained motion, like I was standing in one place and shifting my weight.

Then, right around 3:05, everything dropped back to normal at once. Heart rate. Breathing. Movement.

The watch marked it as me falling back asleep.

I’d like to think it was just a glitch, but part of me felt like that was too consistent. What was it capturing in that time frame?

My wife was the one who suggested using one of those apps that records you while you sleep. She said it might help clear all of this up.

I could tell she was getting fed up with me. I hadn’t done anything wrong, though, so like usual, I just agreed with her.

The first few nights everything seemed pretty normal.

I finally had proof that my wife snored in her sleep, which I won’t lie, felt like a small win.

After maybe the third night, things got weird.

There would be long stretches of silence, the kind you expect when everyone’s asleep. Then, out of nowhere, it would be punctuated by wet, ragged breathing.

We checked to see if the breathing lined up with anything my watch was telling me that was out of place. From about 2:30 to just after 3:00 a.m., I went from awake to exercise, and my heart rate climbed to 150 beats per minute.

My wife was absolutely pissed at this point. The gym in the morning was one thing, but why the fuck was I “working out” at two-thirty in the morning?

I honestly had no answers. It didn’t make any sense to me either.

The next night things got even weirder, and honestly I was getting sick of this mess just as much as she was.

The breathing happened again. Closer this time.

And it wasn’t the only thing we heard.

There was a sound like something being dragged along the floor. Slow. Steady. Like a blanket.

Or maybe a rope.

If I thought she was pissed before, this time she was off her rockers. She started accusing me of doing all sorts of weird shit and promised that over the next few nights she was going to stay awake to make sure I wasn’t pulling anything.

I agreed with her. Boy, what a mistake that was.

Now, this is all according to her, so I’m not sure how accurate any of this is.

She claims I was talking in my sleep. Muttering. Tossing and turning. Saying the same word over and over again.

“Nafnlaus.”

She wanted to know what that meant. She told me I must know what it meant. But I’d never heard that word in my life.

It didn’t stop there.

She said I’d been complaining about my ankle. That the tossing and turning was because it hurt.

According to her, I kept saying it felt like something was pulling on it.

I did some research, and restless leg syndrome actually seemed to make sense. I told her about it and it seemed to calm her down.

We still decided to keep recording. It kept happening, but at that point I was getting used to the weirdness. I think she was too.

Things escalated further.

I woke up one morning and my leg was actively in pain. My ankle was burning.

I tried to play it off at first and keep it to myself. I was probably overthinking it.

That was until I was getting ready for work and finally looked at my ankle.

It was burned.

Not scraped. Not bruised.

Rope burn.

Like someone had wrapped something around my ankle and pulled on it hard.

“The sheets,” I told myself. “Of course. I must have rolled around and gotten caught in the sheets.”

Needless to say, I had a pretty stressful couple of nights after that.

Finally, my wife had another good idea.

Instead of ruining her sleep, we could get a nanny cam to see what was going on.

God, I wish we hadn’t.

I don’t want to tell you what I saw. That would make it real.

I know I have to tell you anyway.

Most of the night was normal. My wife snoring. Silence.

But at 2:30 a.m., things changed.

I started saying it again.

Nafnlaus.

Out of the corner of the room, I saw what looked like a shape glide out and stop at the foot of my bed. It was only there for a split second.

Around that time, I suddenly started to struggle. Like I was fighting something that was pulling me.

That lasted about thirty minutes.

Then I just stopped.

I went back to sleep like nothing had happened.

I don’t think I’m going to show my wife this one.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Ramfis was no FDR, and an authoritarian regime couldn't be held up by a cripple anyways. All the effort to try to shape him up to a masculine, stable leader had in effect failed. 

El Jefe knew this, and was pained by it. His son, more or less, would likely be in physical therapy in France for the foreseeable future. His ambition for retaliation would put him at risk, no matter how hard he would try to protect himself. He would not let the work of almost thirty years pitter away with a poisoned cup of coffee or Legionnaire grenade. The Falange was now, the Falange would be the future. 

He brought together his most trusted advisors, and more or less laid out the plan to them. If he was to be crippled or killed, succession would fall to a new cadre of individuals able to mutually continue the regime into the future. Porfirio Rubirosa, his trusted former-son-in-law, would assume the label of *Caudillo*, no other man had the finesse to do so. Johnny Abbes, the security chief, would retain his role as head of the SIM and direct internal security. Dr. Balaguer, his trusted civilian protege, would retain control of the day-to-day operation of government. Hector Trujillo, his younger brother, would retain control of the military and the Trujillo family's assets inside the country. 

From now on, the goal would be to further the Falange onward, and, as the years go on, to begin a new campaign of violence to safeguard it, and roll back the Falange's opposition and the revolutionary powers of Latin America, to the greatest extent of the DR's limited powers. They would begin a campaign of directed violence with the SIM, a campaign of subversion, intimidation and death. *El Jefe*, in front of Abbes, laid out a number of files with pictures in front of them. They were: 

* Juan Bosch
* Jacobo Arbenz
* Juan Peron
* José Figueres Ferrer

In no particular order, it was hoped that the arm of the SIM would either kill or assist forces willing to kill each. By 1960, El Jefe wanted to see the obituaries in *El Caribe*, by hell or high water.",3,1765670556.0,ColdWarPowers,0,1.0,False

Now my grout is shiny.,"I've totally been one of those people who lives to trash talk TikTok Shop. You know the vibe, the terrible clothes, the cheap tools that break instantly, just the general feeling that everything on there is dollar-store quality. I was 100% convinced it was all junk.  
Then my mom got hooked on that ridiculous slash thing (don't even ask, it's a whole other story). Anyway, she somehow convinced (I’d say pressured) enough people in our extended family to sign up so that she cleared the price down to zero on three whole items.  
Her cart was full of stuff she’d wanted, including a couple of things I thought were peak stupid TikTok trends. We’re talking about a fancy-sounding wireless sonic scrubber for cleaning grout and a minimalist smart mug that supposedly keeps your coffee perfectly warm. I was honestly waiting for the package to arrive so I could watch her fail, bracing myself for a broken tool.  
The box finally showed up a few days ago. First shock, the packaging was actually decent. No crushed boxes, which already defied my expectations.  
I figured I’d test the smart mug first. I poured coffee in, half-expecting it to either stay ice cold or melt the counter. But seriously, this mug is legit. It hooks up to a little app, it keeps the coffee perfectly warm for hours, and it looks so much nicer than I expected. My mom is obsessed with it.  
But the real, mind-blowing surprise was the sonic scrubber. Our kitchen floor grout has been disgusting for years like, no amount of scrubbing has ever worked. My mom went after it with this free tool, and I was honestly just hovering, waiting for the brush head to snap off.  
Y'all. That thing works. It got rid of years of grime in like 20 minutes with barely any effort. The motor is powerful, the attachments feel solid, and the kitchen floor literally looks brand new. I use it on my shower now. It’s seriously the best cleaning tool we own.  
So, yeah we we paid zero dollars, and got stuff that feels genuinely high-quality, works perfectly, and we use all the time (cant’t believe that myself but it’s true)  
I was so ready to post a scathing review about the trash quality, but instead, I'm sitting here with perfectly warm coffee and shining grout. It's a win-win that absolutely shouldn't exist in the real world.  
Has anyone else actually gotten something really solid from one of these crazy aggressive TikTok deals? Did I just get lucky, or are they secretly leveling up the quality?  
P.S. Seriously, this isn't some weird promo post, I'm just genuinely surprised at how good this free stuff actually is.",1,1765670423.0,story,1,0.6,False

1plzunj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1plzunj/should_i_be_worried_that_somethings_missing/,Should I be worried that something’s missing?,"Me (18) and my partner (20) have been together in a long distance relationship for about two weeks now, after being friends for a month. I confessed to him first, and after a long back-and-forth of “what do you want us to be?”, he eventually accepted and we became official.

From my point of view, the relationship is going smoothly. One thing we both have in common is that neither of us is very talkative. Conversations don’t come easily, and most of the time we just hang out, watch movies, or sit together without really talking much.

I tried to start a conversation recently, but it ended with him saying that he’s completely fine with having nothing to talk about. We’re going on our first coffee date next week, and that made me anxious. I started worrying that I’d need to carry the conversation so it wouldn’t feel awkward.

To be honest, in the two weeks we’ve been together, I haven’t really made him laugh the way you see couples do in movies or even in real life. That’s where my insecurity comes in. It makes me question whether he’s genuinely content with me, or if he’s just staying because it’s comfortable or convenient.

Last night, I asked him something that’s been on my mind: “Why did you accept my confession?” I asked because I was genuinely surprised he agreed to be my boyfriend in the first place. His answer was simple: “You’re interesting.”

I don’t know if I’m overthinking this, but I’m wondering: does comfortable silence mean contentment, or should I be worried that something’s missing?

Here is a breakdown of the unique features visible in the photo:

The Vehicle

• Model: It is a classic VW Bug (Beetle), characterized by its iconic rounded fenders and sloping rear profile.

• Paint Job: It features a two-tone paint scheme in dark red and cream, giving it a retro, nostalgic look.

The Coffee Setup

• Roof Sign: There is a massive, oversized coffee mug strapped to the roof rack that reads ""freshly made coffee here,"" acting as a billboard to attract customers.

• Service Counter: A custom wooden shelf has been attached to the passenger side window to create a serving counter. 

It’s decorated with a small potted plant sitting on a stack of books, adding to the cozy, ""hipster"" aesthetic.

• Menu Boards: Two chalkboard signs hang from the door handle and window, listing the menu items and prices:

• Nitro Cold Brew Coffee

• Pour Over Coffee ($4)

• Americano ($3)

• Espresso

• Interior: Through the window, you can spot coffee brewing equipment, suggesting the barista works from inside or uses the car to transport the gear.

Branding

• Logo: The door features a circular logo that says ""on the road coffee,"" which is the name of this specific mobile business.

This setup is a great example of the mobile food/beverage trend, where entrepreneurs use vintage vehicles to create distinct, Instagram-mable storefronts rather than renting traditional brick-and-mortar spaces.",1,1765669875.0,WeirdWackyCars,0,1.0,False

I’m seeing a trend where companies are mandating relocation to different time zones and it seems to counterproductive and unnecessary especially if you collaborate globally. For example, I was working on the East Coast and my company required that I relocate to the West Coast. Now my mornings are filled with 5 AM and 6 AM meetings because I’m still required to collaborate with my Europe counterpart and on top of that I usually work late up to 10 PM collaborating with counterparts in Asia.

So thanks for all who take the time to discuss their thoughts and ideas, because it really helped me with my decision paralysis. I thought I'd share my slightly-manic week of working out what to buy, and possibly the idea that I'm not entirely nuts spending so much time and effort deciding. 

My Touch had been hanging on for its dear life, the wifi wouldn't work anymore but I could still load books from my desktop app. I hadn't been reading as much the last few years, but I rediscovered my love of reading the other week so the ol' Touch came back out. It was fine, it worked, but I decided it was time to upgrade. Well, I ultimately was forced to because the other day I tried manually resetting it and then got stuck in the update loop. I tried sideloading older versions of firmware, but nothing worked. 

I spent days flipflopping between what I wanted, or thought I wanted! My Touch is white, and so that is what I thought I wanted, I was sure that was I needed. I couldn't even think of reading with the distraction of a black bezel. In my research though, I realised that I didn't want or need colour, and I'm annoyingly sensitive to distractions of my reading experience. I went into the stores, held the BW and Colour versions side-by-side. I didn't particularly like the slight texture of the Clara so I was resigning myself to a colour screen with a Libra. However, while playing with the lighting settings on the colour versions, I was not entirely happy with the darker screen of the colour ones. This may have been from bias of reading many threads about this, so I was trying to take that into account. I had just missed the sales though, and so the Clara was looking more attractive. I left the store with no purchase, and continued my frantic research online. 

Friday, the day I bricked my poor Touch. On one hand, I had so much work to do, it was possibly a sign I should do that instead of reading. On the other, I was also in the early beginnings of a book I was dying to read this weekend. So I hopped back online, still convinced I couldn't possibly read a book comfortably with the black bezel, I put the Clara White Colour in my cart with the clear case. I clicked right through to the checkout, but I just couldn't go through with it. 

Stepping back, I made myself a cup of coffee and started researching the black vs white bezel debate. I concluded that a BW screen was going to be the best suited for my needs and experience, and that I could get a skin for it. So with the Claras on special, I changed it to the BW version and when I got the email advising my click and collect order was ready, I was off. 

I had an event that night, so I had to wait until I got home. As soon as my keys went on to the hook, I ripped open the box with the joy one gets from opening new toys. The slight texture to the plastic didn't seem to be as rough as what I remember it being in the store, in fact, I actually liked it. I was also excited to finally be able to connect to Overdrive. With my Clara now set up, cup of coffee in hand, I started reading my book. 

And.... I LOVE MY BW CLARA! As I read from some other threads, I too, really enjoy the contrast of the screen with the black bezel. The speed at which the pages turned was lightning fast, compared to my Touch. I really like the feel of the clear case as well. 

So friends, that is my tale of deciding on which Kobo to buy. Am I nuts? Likely. Am I happy? Yes! I finished my book just before, and have borrowed a book I've been wanting to read for ages so I'm one happy lady. ",8,1765669617.0,kobo,0,1.0,False

1plzkrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/grammys/comments/1plzkrv/where_is_the_aim_of_life/,where is the aim of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Looks like I stumbled upon an anti-Amazon protest or just a seriously weird Christmas market.,"Hey guys, it's been a strange day. I was walking past 11th Street today and saw a literal crowd gathered outside a building. I thought, well, maybe someone is giving away free coffee or it’s just a line for a trendy bar.

On the window, I saw the name: 'No bot shop'. So, I walked up to a guy in the crowd. I asked him: ""what's going on here? Like, just regular Christmas discounts?""

He was like, nah man, this is 'no bots'. He said it's like a protest against everyone buying from bots and resellers. And yeah, they're raffling off some ""cool"" stuff too.

I didn't go inside (I was rushing), but I texted my friends' group chat (they're huge fans of such events), and five of them rushed over there.

So. How normal is this event anyway? Is this some ""new wave"" in retail where people are tired of ""algorithms""? Is it just hype or reeeaal innovation?

It's the 13th today, so I guess this is their last day. If anyone went, share your unfiltered opinions!",0,1765669072.0,sanfrancisco,4,0.18,False

Waves rippled over the gold speckled chlorophyll sea; skyward stalks stretched tall and moved as one, silk strands were whipping with the wind creating the illusion of crests and crashes in this aqueous flora. I sat watching the infinite stretch of corn; my blonde hair whipping synchronously with the stalks, my boots being used mindlessly to carve a small trench in the hillside, and my fingers fighting to pick the pink nail polish off of each other. It was morning, early enough that I didn't have anything to do yet but late enough that the roosters had stopped crowing; I liked this time. Today was looking to be a rough one; I was my father’s only child so he put me on a pedestal; but he was predestined to be a farmer so it was a pedestal made of hay and scrap wood. In his world I was his princess who should want for nothing, but in the real world that same princess works in the shit and heat to keep the kingdom running. It’s the end of summertime and while normal children were drenched with chlorinated water and stuffed with sugary treats from a truck; I was getting drenched with sweat and snacking on leathery jerky from our recent slaughter.

It wasn’t all bad, I know I'm not selling it well but I promise it wasn’t all bad.

Despite their messy nature and tendency to throw tantrums, I loved the animals on our farm. We had your basic fare; a few pretty cows, a lot of clueless chickens, some goats that didn't understand personal space, and an anxious horse. I loved them all … except for the horse, I tolerated him. He gave me such an uneasy feeling when he would look at me with those empty eyes.

I used to give all of them names but as the years have gone on I realized it's a lot easier to eat your dinner when you don’t know exactly who you’re eating… they just come and go… That damn horse is the only one that stays around.

I also really enjoyed spending time in the woods around us. Ever since I turned 11 at the start of the summer my dad has let me explore pretty deep and I have grown very fond of my surroundings. Before I used to have to stay within sight of wherever my dad was working on the farm; it was pretty difficult with the dense foliage on some parts of our property. This summer though, when I didn’t have to help my dad around the farm I spent the time walking through the forest, marking my way on the rocks and trees and trying to find something new each time I went out. Sometimes I'd find a nice pond with a surface that hadn’t been disturbed since its beginning,  or I'd find a meadow with a family of deer, grazing gently before they galloped into the distance.

As of late I’ve been getting really frustrated. I have a central point within the woods, a clearing within the trees fully covered by the overhead canopy. This is my crossroads, the middle of the forest as I had declared it. It had four diverging paths which I had called North, South, East, and West without ever bringing a compass out there. I explored in a rotational pattern and as of late I haven't been able to go west; every time I tried, about an hour into my trek I’d run into construction. It varies on the level of completion and business based on my position, but a wall of construction consistently blocks my escapades. I’m sure it’s planned to be a brand new motel, meant to trap families into this nothing town for a while and boost our miniscule influence; or a new block of spaces for rent that will take turns opening and failing until we run out of small business dreamers in this town. I hate this pointless construction… I hate those stupid tractors that scream obscenities during the bird’s songs… I hate the men who spit and laugh as they rip the roots and ransack the land… I hate that they feel they have the right to intrude on this space.

It was late August when things started to shift in strange ways; a particularly nasty storm had blown through the day before, I was off school and decided to explore the woods for any debris that might’ve blown through. The morning air smelled damp and sweet, I walked along the “South” path, boots soft against the mossy earth and leaving a clear trail for me to follow back. I was far enough from the construction that all I could hear here were the occasional calls of birds, wind weaving its way through tangles of branches, and the faint rustle of leaves. Though in the back I knew the machines were chewing the forest apart somewhere beyond the ridges; here, the world felt like it was okay. I walked for a while until I had to stop and double take suddenly the forest…changed. It didn’t move necessarily, but one second it looked a certain way and the next it seemed like an entirely new path had opened up. The trees thinned uncharacteristically in this spot, a little bit past them a small hollow I hadn’t noticed before had formed. I swore I had walked this path countless times and never seen anything resembling this. 

I stepped closer, curiosity pulling me in.

The formation was strange; tall, straight trunks that twisted suddenly, subtly, at impossible angles; their bark patches of thick stone like scales and sections of smooth blackened curves, bare and scorched by a flame the rest of the earth suggested had never existed. Higher up, branches curved toward each other, meeting overhead to form arches, almost like the forest had decided to shape itself into a cathedral. Sunlight broke through the canopy in golden slivers in scattered beams and hit the trunks in odd ways: one shaft made the bark directly ahead gleam with a wet, oily sheen, though the earth around it was bone-dry.

I circled the hollow slowly, fingertips brushing the cold, smooth bark surrounding me. It was unnerving, yes, but more fascinating than frightening. There was a rhythm here, the air almost musical, the way the trunks leaned and bent, purposeful. A subtle hum vibrated in the space, not loud enough to earn a name but enough to make my hair prickle. I tilted my head and listened, half-expecting it to vanish if I blinked, but it stayed, patient and still.

A thin wisp of fog clung to the roots, curling like smoke around the bases of the trees. I knelt to touch it, and it was neither wet nor cold, just… present, like it had been waiting for me. The smell of the forest changed slightly here, something richer, darker, more ancient. I shivered but smiled, curiosity overrode everything. Something about it made me feel like I was the first to see it, the only one who had the right to wander here.

Yet, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the trees were watching. Not in the way animals watch, but in some way older; more patient, more knowing. They leaned, they twisted, and they breathed in a rhythm of their own making, inviting me to stay and explore, but warning me at the same time that the forest had rules I didn’t yet understand.

I stood, brushing the fog from my knees, and took one last look before moving on. The hollow seemed smaller from the edge, more like a trick of the woods than a formation. But I knew I’d be back. Something about it had lodged itself in my chest, quiet and persistent, whispering that the forest was older and stranger than I’d ever believed.

A time later school had finally started up, the late seasonal storms persisted, I trudged up the hill leading from school, backpack sagging and shoes caked with mud from the rains. The sun was still high, promising the kind of golden afternoon that made me want to disappear into the woods, follow the paths for hours, maybe the storms had opened up a new section I hadn’t seen before.

“Suzannah!” Dad’s voice carried across the yard before I even reached the gate. He was leaning on the handle of a pitchfork, right next to the door, ready with assumptions. His shoulders were squared and eyes tired but alert. “Throw your things in your room real quick. There’s work to do.”

I sighed dramatically. “I was just about to-”

“Just cause school’s done for the day doesn’t mean you get off, not with the barns still needing prep.”

I stomped my boot. “I don’t care about the barns! I want to go explore! There’s probably scrap blown around and-”

“No,” he said, sharp, cutting me off. “You’ll help me clean out the pig pen and then maybe you can go out. The last storm tore half the fencing down, if you think I’m doing it alone, think again.”

I groaned. “That’s disgusting!”

“It’s called responsibility,” he said, jaw tight. “I don’t get to choose and neither do you, it’s just something we have to do.”

We argued for a while longer, my protests echoing against the house walls while he stayed immovable until finally I gave in, dragging myself toward the pen with as much theatrical misery as I could muster.

The smell hit me first, the lingering tang of mud and urine, warm and sour; and then the sight, trampled straw, upturned soil, a dozen pigs sniffing and squealing at our intrusion. I rolled up my sleeves and shoved past the disgusting muck. Hours passed in silence broken only by the low grunt of pigs and Dad’s occasional barked instruction.

By the time the last corner of the pen was scrubbed and the fence repaired, the sun was dipping low, streaking the sky with reds and violets. I brushed straw from my hair and wiped sweat from my forehead.

“Can I just go a little ways into the woods? Before it gets too dark?” I asked, voice tentative, almost pleading.

Dad hesitated, hands on his hips; His eyes softened, but only a fraction. “Just a little,” he said finally. “Stay close to the South path. Don’t wander where the forest’s thick. I don’t want to have to come looking for you.”

I barely thanked him, sprinting past the barn and down the gentle slope toward the trees, boots crunching on leaves and squelching mud. The woods were transforming, shadows lengthening, the gradient of sunset giving way to deepening blues. The fog from the morning still clung lightly to the roots and hollows here, curling around my ankles as if curious to follow me.

It was beautiful, free, peaceful…until the light faded further.

I slowed and noticed as shapes in the woods seemed to stretch and lean where they hadn’t before, branches whispered together in a wind I couldn’t feel, eyes of bystanders shone bright in the last light fighting to stay. My pulse quickened and the golden path home felt impossibly far. I told myself I was imagining it, that the forest was just big and quiet. I kept calm and collected and was near our home when I turned one of the last corners. In the spot where the willow usually stood, sheltering and soft; the shadows thickened into a void, a dark wall of trees that sucked all the sound away from the space and seemingly wanted to suck me in too. A shiver ran down my spine, I spun on my heels and ran, faster than I’d ever run before; boots slipping on wet leaves, arms crashing through sharp branches, my chest heaving and begging for air.

I ran and ran until finally, the house came into view. I didn’t slow down, didn’t stop, and didn’t look back. I flew past Dad, still at the barn, looking at me with that small mix of worry and exhaustion in his eyes. I didn’t pause, didn’t speak, didn’t catch my breath until I slammed my bedroom door behind me and collapsed onto the bed, heart hammering, blanket pulled tight around me. I stayed like this for a long while, panicked and trying to do anything to slow the rise and fall of my breath, confused how my woods could ever make me feel this way, angry my father had been proven right in his worries.

Outside, the forest settled into dark silence, the wind shifting gently. Nothing had overtly chased me. Nothing touched me. But in the quiet, I knew the woods had been watching, patient and unyielding… dangerous. I collapsed into sleep, not because i wanted too, but out of mental and physical exhaustion

Morning slid slowly over the sky, clouded in gray and fighting to let the light through. It was the kind of light that felt like it had to work hard to get all the way down into our little kitchen. I padded in half-awake, still feeling the leftover ache in my legs and lungs from the night before. Dad was already at the table, elbows braced on either side of his coffee like he was keeping it from running away.

He glanced up when I came in. Not sharply, more like he’d been waiting for the moment our eyes would meet and dreaded it a little. I stood by the doorway.

“You sleep okay?” he asked.

“Yes,” I lied and it came out too quick, too neat, almost rude.

Dad nodded, his fingers drummed once against the mug. “Good. That’s good.” He took a sip then cleared his throat in a way that meant he had been rehearsing the next sentence. “Listen. I, uh… I don’t want you going out that late again. Not by the woods. Not like that.”

I waited for the familiar need to argue; the immediate spark of but it’s my time, my place, my woods; the usual urge to push back just on principle. Instead there was a cool and hollow space where that feeling should’ve been. The memory of the forest in near total darkness, the way the shapes stretched wrong, how the paths seemed to bend in ways they didn’t initially shook me even now.

“I won’t,” I said. The surprise hit both of us at the same time.

Dad blinked. “You won’t?”

“No.” I forced a little shrug, casual, but my stomach felt tight. “It was… darker than I thought. I’ll go earlier next time.”

This was true, it had been darker and scarier than I’d expected, but there was something more. This feeling that even though nothing physically happened to me, I needed to be wary of my former safe space. He watched me for a long moment, eyes narrowed in that way that meant he was trying to see more than I was saying. Maybe he did. Maybe he didn’t. Either way, he just reached for his mug again and said, “Alright then. Thank you.”

I sat down across from him, the chair felt colder than it should. The woods, my woods, weren’t supposed to scare me. They’d always been the place I slipped into when everything else felt too loud. But now, thinking about them there was a thin shiver up my back, something I couldn’t name. The trees weren’t just trees last night. The quiet wasn’t just quiet. The paths hadn’t felt like they were leading to anything; more like they’d been waiting for me to follow them too far.

I didn’t want Dad to see any of that on my face, so I looked down at the table instead. There was a grain in the wood shaped almost like an eye, something I’d never noticed before. It stared at me until I looked away. Dad didn’t say anything else and neither did I. The silence between us wasn’t the usual kind. It felt like we were both listening for something; him for whatever had changed in me, and me for whatever was still out there in the shifting half-light of the forest. Breakfast continued, the tension slowly defrosting as time passed, we arrived at something semi-normal by the end of it.

Dad and I got around to the more mundane chores around the house for a few hours, by the time we were ready to leave for a little break the clouds had thinned enough to let the sun through in pale patches, the brightening of the day also seemed to brighten our moods. Dad tossed me the keys without looking and told me to start the car up while he grabbed some things.

“Don’t touch the radio.” he said habitually.

“I won’t!” I slyly replied, climbing into the passenger seat of his truck, the vinyl still cold against the backs of my legs. The engine coughed to life like it always did, a sound so familiar and comforting; I flipped from his country hits of the 1800’s station and found something at least a little listenable.

Dad jumped in the truck and feigned a disgruntled look.

“It was like that when I got in.” I giggled.

Dad flashed a little smile and we started down the driveway, tires crunching over gravel, the farm shrinking behind us in the side mirror. The woods slipped past in quiet clusters, and I made a point not to stare too long at them.

Dad drummed his fingers against the steering wheel, then cleared his throat. “We’ve been working for a bit, you hungry?”

“Always.”

“Wanna grab something from Pat real quick?”

“Yes please! That ol girl we sent to him awhile back looked like real good eatin, hopefully we get some of her.”

He snorted despite himself and changed his map. A few seconds later, he reached over, turned the radio dial, and rolled the windows down. It was some old country station crackling through the speakers; He didn’t sing, but he hummed, barely, under his breath. The music rang out

“And did I hear you say he was a-meetin' you here today.

To take you to his mansion in the sky?”

It felt nice. Normal. Like the quiet from earlier had been packed away somewhere neither of us needed to look at just yet.

As we got closer to town the woods gave way to fields and the fields gave way to scattered houses and sun-faded signs. The storm had left everything washed clean, puddles still lingered in the cracks of the road and gave it all a sheen in the sunlight. Dad slowed as we passed the water tower, coming to a stop and nodding once at a man leaning against a fence who lifted two fingers in return. He lumbered over to our truck with a gait that was both powerful and painful. We hopped out and met him in the middle.

“Mornin Buddy” he called to my father, shaking his hand, “Hey sunshine” he smiled at me “Need anything special today?”

I thought about it. “Maybe jerky… and those weird sodas you got, the ones in glass bottles...please”

He smiled, small and soft. “You’ve got good taste little lady.”

He lumbered to his truck parked over in the grass and grabbed his homemade goods, we exchanged money then conversation then pleasantries until we finally left about an hour later. My dad and I snacked and laughed as we drove.

The truck rolled to a stop in front of the general store, its front windows cluttered with handwritten signs and artifactual advertisements.

“Alright,” he said, opening his door. “Let’s get what we need before you convince me to buy nonsense.”

I hopped down after him, the bell above the store door chiming as he pushed it open, warm light spilling out to greet us. We walked into the same scene I’d seen thousands of times, walls of snacks with distinct gaps where items had hadn’t been refilled in years, tchotchkes for the weary traveller in case they want to reminisce on some random nothing town they stopped to pee at, supplies for the people who actually lived here, and two faces I'd easily call family; Mr. and Mrs. Cooke. They had been running the general store since well before I’d been born, They were in their mid 70’s now but the walls were plastered with the different eras of their life; mixed between fishing records caught in our creeks, pamphlets about local hunting and fishing guidelines, and drawings from children, long moved on to bigger places.

As soon as we stepped inside Dad leaned down just enough for only me to hear him,

“Be good,” he said, not stern, just a reminder. “I’m gonna grab feed and bolts. Say hi to the Cooke’s.”

“I never wander and I was going to anyway” I said, sounding snippy but meaning to be reassuring.

He gave me a look that said he didn’t believe me then smiled and tussled my hair and headed down one of the narrow aisles, boots thudding softly against the worn floorboards.

The heavy wooden door hadn’t even finished settling when Mrs. Cooke looked up from behind the counter. Her face brightened in that familiar loving way, like flipping on a light that had been turned on and off a thousand times before.

“Well I’ll be,” she beamed. “If it isn’t Suzie.”

“Hi, Mrs. Cooke,” I smiled, already drifting closer.

Mr. Cooke pushed himself up from the stool beside her with a grunt that sounded like it had more weight than it used to. “Dang sweetie you’re getting tall,” he said, squinting at me the same way he always did, like this was new information every time. “Did you grow again?”

“I don’t think so,” I said. “I think you just keep forgetting how tall I already am.”

He laughed at that, slow and genuine. “That could be.”

Mrs. Cooke reached out and wrapped me in a hug, her touch papery but warm. “How’s school treating you, sweetheart?”

“It’s fine,” I said. “Boring. But i’m doing well in all my classes.”

She nodded like that answered everything. “That’s good. Boring is good. Means nothing’s gone wrong.”

Mr. Cooke shuffled behind the counter and bent down, rummaging through a drawer that squeaked in protest. “I got something for you,” he said, voice muffled. He emerged holding a small, carved bass. “Finished this yesterday. Thought of you.”

I took it carefully. “Thank you sir, it’s so pretty.”

Mrs. Cooke smiled, but there was something soft and tired behind it. Mr. Cooke smiled with her, “You’re always so polite.”

The store hummed around us; the fridges buzzing, the old ceiling fan ticking like it was holding on for its life, the light murmur of the old radio, unable to be turned off out of the fear it’ll never turn on again.

I noticed, suddenly, the energy of the room shifted.

Mr. Cooke leaned his elbows on the counter, close now. “You still walking those woods?” he asked, casual, like he was asking about the weather, but stern enough to imply a truthful response was necessary.

I hesitated, just a beat. “Not as much,” I said.

Mrs. Cooke nodded slowly. “That happens,” she said. “This place has been changing, things have felt off.”

From the aisle behind me, I heard Dad’s footsteps returning. Mrs. Cooke squeezed my sleeve once more before letting go.

“You watch after your father,” she said.

“I will,” I promised.

Dad appeared beside me, arms full, giving them a nod. “She behave?”

“Always does,” Mr. Cooke said, smiling. “You’re raisin her right.”

We paid and I glanced back at them as we walked away from the counter, these two familiar figures behind the same old register, standing in a store that felt like it was gently holding its breath.

For a moment, I had the strangest urge to stay a little longer.

The drive back was easy, dad didn’t say much, expect much; he just hummed along with the radio again, one hand steady on the wheel with the other resting loose out the window. I leaned back against the seat, with jerky half-forgotten in my pocket and the glass bottle rolling gently against my ankle every time we hit a bump.

The town slipped away behind us. Houses thinned into fields, fields into fence lines, fence lines into trees. I watched it all pass through the dusty windows, sunlight flashing between branches in soft stuttering patterns. The woods still made my stomach tighten if I looked too long, but it wasn’t sharp anymore. More like a bruise you forgot about until you pressed on it.

Dad reached over at one point and cracked my window open a little wider. “You good?” he asked, eyes still on the road.

“Yeah,” I said… I meant it.

The sun was warm where it spilled through the glass, settling across my arms and face. The truck’s engine droned, low and constant while the radio faded into something indistinct; voices and strings blending into a soft blur. My eyelids grew heavy before I could fight it. I shifted, tucking my chin down, letting the rhythm of the road carry me.

I fell asleep feeling safe.

When I woke, the light had changed.

For a second I didn’t know where I was. The world rocked gently beneath me, slow and patient, like breathing. Then the smell of grass and dirt came through without the feeling of them. The distant sound of cicadas rang in a rising chorus. I blinked, squinting up at the sky.

I was in the hammock.

The old one Dad strung between the two trees behind the house, the fabric worn thin and soft from years of use. A blanket was tucked around my legs, careful, like someone had tried not to wake me. My shoes were resting in the grass to my left. My head rested against something folded just right…Dad’s jacket, placed there to look like an afterthought but requiring more thought than he’d admit out loud.

The sky above me was brushed in deepening oranges and purples, dusk settling in slowly and deliberately. The clouds caught the last of the sun’s fire, glowing at their edges before dimming to a cool purple. The air had cooled, just enough to raise goosebumps on my arms.

I laid there and listened.

The farm was quietly active in its usual ways. Somewhere a door creaked, an animal shifted, the wind moved through leaves in a low hush. Nothing felt wrong. Nothing felt rushed.

Dad must’ve noticed me asleep when we got back, must’ve decided I needed the rest. I pictured him lifting me out of the truck, awkward and careful, pretending I weighed less than I did. The thought made my chest ache in a small, gentle way.

I turned my head slightly, watching the treeline darken as the sun slipped lower. The woods were there, just as they always had been. Tall. Still. Waiting. But from here, wrapped in fabric and warmth, they felt far away, contained by distance and light and the quiet confidence of the land I knew.

I knew, distantly, that something had shifted. That the woods were no longer just woods. That the quiet carried more weight than it used to. That paths could change if you weren’t paying attention. But for now, the hammock held me. The sky burned beautifully. The day loosened its grip.

I closed my eyes again, not to sleep this time, just to rest there a moment longer…suspended between light and dark, between the sky and the earth, between childhood and whatever waited next….content, despite it all.",1,1765669037.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I keep seeing “Taiwan or Malaysia?” pop up in nomad chats, so here’s a practical comparison from a *remote-work* perspective: cost, vibes, internet, visas, transport, weather, and the best base cities.

  


# 🏙️ The vibe (this matters more than you think)

**🇹🇼 Taiwan:**  
Feels *organized, safe, efficient*. Great public transit, clean cities, and you’re never far from mountains/hikes/hot springs. Daily life is smooth and predictable in the best way.

**🇲🇾 Malaysia:**  
Feels *relaxed, tropical, multicultural*. More “easy mode” day-to-day (English widely spoken, Grab is cheap), with quick access to islands and beach escapes.

  


# 🏙️ The vibe (this matters more than you think)

**🇹🇼 Taiwan:**  
Feels *organized, safe, efficient*. Great public transit, clean cities, and you’re never far from mountains/hikes/hot springs. Daily life is smooth and predictable in the best way.

**🇲🇾 Malaysia:**  
Feels *relaxed, tropical, multicultural*. More “easy mode” day-to-day (English widely spoken, Grab is cheap), with quick access to islands and beach escapes.

  


# 💸 Cost of living (typical nomad reality)

**Malaysia is usually cheaper**, especially for rent + eating out.

* **Rent (1BR)**: Taiwan $500–$900 (Taipei higher) vs Malaysia $300–$600 (KL often lower)
* **Meals**: Taiwan \~$3–$6 vs Malaysia \~$2–$4
* **Coffee**: Taiwan \~$3–$5 vs Malaysia \~$2–$4
* **Mobile data**: both good, Malaysia often cheaper with bigger packages

✅ **Budget winner:** Malaysia  
✅ **Value-for-infrastructure:** Taiwan

  


# 📡 Internet + working from cafés

**Taiwan:** consistently fast + reliable, and café culture is *very* laptop-friendly.  
**Malaysia:** generally good in major hubs (KL, Penang), but speeds can vary more by neighborhood/building.

✅ **Reliability winner:** Taiwan

  


# 🛂 Visas (the big deciding factor for many)

**Malaysia:** has a dedicated nomad-friendly option (DE Rantau).  
**Taiwan:** has emerging nomad pathways + strong long-term route for skilled pros via the **Employment Gold Card**.

✅ Best “nomad-style” setup: **Malaysia**  
✅ Best long-term residence/work route: **Taiwan (Gold Card)**

  


# 🚇 Transportation (daily life)

**Taiwan:** metro + trains are excellent; high-speed rail makes moving between cities easy.  
**Malaysia:** KL has transit but Grab is the real MVP; domestic flights make island hopping convenient.

✅ Best public transport: Taiwan  
✅ Best cheap rides + regional flights: Malaysia

  


# 🌤 Weather

**Taiwan:** subtropical with seasons (north can be rainy; summers can bring typhoons).  
**Malaysia:** hot/humid all year with monsoon seasons.

If you want **seasons** → Taiwan  
If you want **endless summer** → Malaysia

  


# 🍜 Food culture

**Taiwan:** night markets, dumplings, noodles, bubble tea — super consistent, convenient.  
**Malaysia:** insane variety (Malay/Chinese/Indian/Peranakan) — one of the best food countries in Asia.

✅ Variety winner: Malaysia  
✅ Street-food-night-market experience: Taiwan (very strong)

  


# 🌿 Nature & weekends

**Taiwan:** mountains + hikes + hot springs are ridiculously accessible from cities.  
**Malaysia:** beaches/islands/rainforest are the main draw.

✅ Mountains/adventure: Taiwan  
✅ Islands/beach life: Malaysia

  


# 🧑‍💻 Best base cities (quick picks)

**Taiwan 🇹🇼**

* **Taipei** — coworking + cafés + events
* **Taichung** — better weather + creative vibe
* **Kaohsiung** — cheaper coastal city
* **Hualien** — nature + focus mode
* **Tainan** — history + slower pace

**Malaysia 🇲🇾**

* **Kuala Lumpur** — modern + affordable
* **Penang (George Town)** — culture + cafés
* **Ipoh** — low-cost & chill
* **Melaka** — heritage vibes
* **Langkawi** — island “workcation” energy

  


# ✅ TL;DR — Which should you choose?

# Pick Taiwan 🇹🇼 if you want:

* ⚡ ultra-reliable internet
* 🚇 top-tier public transit
* ⛰ mountains/hikes/hot springs close by
* 🧘 safe, structured, efficient daily life
* 🧳 a strong long-term pathway (Gold Card)

# Pick Malaysia 🇲🇾 if you want:

* 💸 lower cost of living
* 🌴 tropical weather year-round
* 🏝 easy island/beach escapes
* 🗣 English-friendly daily life
* 🛂 a dedicated nomad visa option (DE Rantau)

  


If you’ve lived in either (or both), I’d love to hear:  
**What surprised you most?** And which city would you go back to for a 3-month work sprint?

1plz7y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1plz7y9/i_am_so_exhausted_but_do_i_have_a_right_to_be/,i am so exhausted but do i have a right to be?,"i (21f) really need some perspectives on if i'm being an entitled brat or not. a few months ago my grandparents (68f, 72m) moved in with me and my mom, but it was short notice and i didnt get to have any say in the matter. my mom lives and works out of town so she didn't bother to come down to clean out their room or make sure they settled in. i had to clean out the room pretty much entirely by myself eventho it was my sisters old room and she lives not even 10 minutes away. 

my grandma has huntingtons and is extremely stubborn but the problem is my grandpa. he had such a hard time adjusting. he was angry and lost most of the time and it was extremely difficult for everyone. at first my aunt and cousins came over often and he did well with people he recognized.

but he was constantly looking for cigarettes. he would flick them so hard they'd turn off or snap in half and blame me. he would scream that they weren't lit eventho they were. he would smoke 4 or 5 in one sitting and not remember any of it. it got to the point where we were buying at least 6 packs a week. if i wasnt outside lighting them then he was coming inside with a lit cigarette and we worried about him purposefully setting a fire to prove they ""weren't on."" 

he refuses to do anything for himself. he won't get his own drink from the fridge. he won't pick out his clothes. he won't put his plate in the sink (or wash them). he won't clean the mess he makes from eating. he wouldn't throw his trash away (he would throw it at me instead but he's gotten better). hes physically capable of all of this but he refuses to because ""thats a woman's job."" 

my grandma washes his dishes, washes and hangs up his clothes, picks out his outfits, cooks and serves him, makes him coffee, and cleans up all his bathroom accidents and its never enough. he complains that she can't cook. complains that she takes too long cooking. complains and complains and complains. he'll storm out so aggressively he stumbles. he'll throw food out just cuz hes upset. 

and he justifies it all by saying we're women and thats our job. that's what we're supposed to do. we have to do everything for him because he's a man. 

now im a feminist (and a lesbian) and the thought of having to care for a grown ass man like he's a toddler has always infuriated me. and somehow i still have to deal with a man's entitlement. i feel like i'm getting constantly broken down. as a person. with my beliefs in general. im just so exhausted with all his yelling, and his arguments, and his misogyny. but especially how he treats my grandma. hes never once said thank you. or please. even in his good moments. 

he's chased me three times with a lit cigarette. i worry about him throwing it at me. intentionally lighting my hair or my clothes on fire. he blows smoke in my face even after i move away and i worry he'll burn my face. last night i had to pull him by the back of his vest because he was chasing my grandma and she couldn't get away fast enough. i got in between them and he grabbed my arm so hard i thought he was gonna hit me. 

hes taller, weights around 150 and im 5'1 and weigh 95lbs. i cant do anything but take it if one day i can't talk him down. 

my aunts say to keep him busy. give him chores. tasks. games. but i cant handle any of that anymore. its not that easy. its not as easy as make sure he doesn't fall over or stand between him and grandma so he doesn't hit her again. 

sometimes i have to hide in my room because i cant be around either of them. im depressed and have an eating disorder so my emotions are constantly all over the place and im really missing the alone time that helps me reset. i babysit my nephew from 5:30-3 and get home to watch my grandpa until he sleeps at 9:30-10. i feel like such an ass because i can't put a smile on and keep him entertained. my aunt has repeatedly told me thats going to make him decline faster but i just. i CANT. 

i feel like i'm leading him to an early death because i don't have the energy to care for him properly. 

nobody comes over anymore. they fight in the family group chat about who comes over and who doesnt but NOBODY actually does. i can't drive (nor do i have a car) so we have to ask for rides but everyone's always mad. they're always scoffing and groaning and treating us like we're such burdens because they're too busy and dont have time to take us to get groceries. 

my grandpa started three fires with his cigarettes (nothing but the pot he throws them into actually burned) and it started such a bad argument people didnt want to come over for thanksgiving. my mom is pissed about family being in her house. shes pissed about grandpas bathroom accidents occurring outside the bathroom. shes mad about everything and throws tantrums like a toddler.

i feel like everything fell to me. i cant do anything right because i don't know what to look for symptoms wise and im not good at spotting it. i cant drive. i cant cook. i can't talk to anyone because i have no friends, my (ld) girlfriend is upset about me being tired all the time and not being able to call 24/7, and if i tell any family it starts fights. 

my grandpa has always been a dick so i never really liked him but now its. it's him progressively getting worse until he dies. and thats hard to grapple with because i don't know if i ever loved him but now i'm being faced with his mortality and i feel like such a selfish asshole. we don't know how much time he has left but its getting increasingly difficult to cherish the moments we have with him when theyre nothing but aggression. i think deep down i know im being a brat and i just have to suck it up because that's the only option. 

i know i'll look back and regret ever feeling upset. i know my family will say i didnt try hard enough. i know hes only going to get worse. i know i need to stop acting like a little kid who can't handle any responsibilities. but at the same time i have no fucking idea what im doing. i have no one to talk to. ive never been mentally stable so how am i supposed to take care of two people when ive repeatedly given up when it comes to my own life.

nobody has any space for them and i don't have a job so im the only option. everyone has their own lives so they can't be bothered to come over. they talked about getting a nurse to visit during the day when i'm out babysitting but aside from my mom being upset about having a stranger over, they can't get help unless they have medicaid (or something) which they keep getting denied for. money's tight for everyone so we can't all pitch in. they talked about a nursing home or something of the sort but nobody wants that.

i feel like such a baby cry for being upset. i feel like i'm not doing enough to warrant being tired. i feel utterly incapable. its not as easy as don't provoke him when he sees us as subservient and therefore ""mouthing off"" just because we're women. my aunts fight over medication. they don't want him to be a zombie all day because of sleeping pills. they don't want him to nap because that would mean im not keeping him engaged and thats making him worse.",4,1765668587.0,dementia,3,1.0,False

It is a group walk so the pace will be slower so I would dress warm and comfortable !!!! 





The forecast for the start at 10:00 a.m. is -8 c, a few flurries, winds out of the NW 20 km/h, by noon the winds are supposed to pick up, NW at 30 km/h and gusts up to 50 kmh.  
	




Meeting at the Northeast corner of Bloor Ave. and Yonge Street and we will be leaving at 10:00 am. 






Description:  I am tall white old dude, short cropped grey beard, I will be in either green pants or if I go with my insulated pants they will tan, slate blue hooded winter coat, black knapsack. I don't think at -8 there will be many people just hanging around so I should be easy to spot. 





We will be ending at Kensington Market for a coffee for those interested from the recommendation of u/at-minimum







It will be a UofT, Kensington Market, etc. The walk will be somewhere close to 8 km's.




No photos of others without their express permission.





The pace will be one where everyone can keep up.






I would strongly suggest using the washroom before leaving and there is one at Yonge and Bloor should anyone need one before it starts. Public bathroom access can be iffy at times.





Be respectful of others

It’s directly attached to my front entryway and leads into the kitchen and rest of the house via a large doorway on the east end. 

Currently my couch is on the south wall and the tv is on the north with the two recliners on the west wall in front of the picture window. I hate it because we have to walk around the couch and coffee table to get in. Zero flow. 

I’m looking to get a modular couch that gives us more options to switch things up for movie nights or when we entertain. Our family consists of 4 people, but we often have 2-4 people over and need a lot of seating. 

I’ve attached a “blank” of the living room, then options for the new modular couch.

\*Everything in pictures is measured and to scale - measurements of our room and some options for layout - none of which I’m attached to. The only non negotiable is that we keep the recliners - they were investment pieces from Sweden made for tall folks (like us) and are so comfortable.

1plz3nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1plz3nl/ever_notice_how_bodyshaming_in_gay_spaces_works/,Ever notice how body-shaming in gay spaces works exactly like straight people judging gays?,"I’ve been thinking about something I noticed in a sex-positive gay space, and it kind of messed with my head in an interesting way. But it also could be that I'm a bit higher than usual.

Sometimes people comment on who I'm with:
“Why him?”
“He’s \*something about body\*”
“You can do better.”

At first I thought it was just mean. But then it clicked.. it’s the same structure straight society uses on gay people.

“Why would you choose to be with someone with the same sex?”

It’s not really about attraction. They don't really care whom are you attracted to and not curious about the science of sexuality. It’s about hierarchy or the norm. And them feeling safe about their validity. 

Certain bodies are ranked higher. And when someone doesn’t follow that ranking, others feel the need to comment.

*.... we, the normal gays, only go after the hottest ones(socially accepted beauty standards). This guy ranks lower than the threshold or is outside the norm. You're deviation. Explain yourself....*

almost like a social check:

Will i distance yourself from the “undesirable” guy?

Will i laugh it off or downplay it?

Will i quietly accept the norm?

Basically: Will I play along so the hierarchy/the Norm stays intact?

What surprised me is how effective very boring, calm responses are:

“I like him.”

“That’s my taste.”

No defending. No explaining. No moral speech. I learned it during the never-ending coming out process. I've found that works best. Because any further inquisitive reply sounds really stupid. Like, are you really questioning why I like coffee? Or blueberries? Or men? Or drinking room-tempeeature water?


On the other hand, the responses that felt worst later were:

1plz3fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/katyheads/comments/1plz3fw/why_did_katys_songwriting_drastically_change_from/,Why did Katy's songwriting drastically change from OOTB to TD,"One of the reasons why I love OOTB so much is because of how much personality it exudes. Now, don't get me wrong, I think all of Katy's albums are a joy to listen to (143 to a lesser extent, unfortunately), but it is undeniable how unique OOTB is in comparison to her other albums when it comes to lyrics. The songwriting is still very tongue in cheek most of the time, but it's also raw and gritty in a way that we haven't seen her do on other records. For example, while I could imagine a song like Tucked or Never Really Over fitting perfectly on PRISM, a song like A Cup of Coffee or Mannequin would sound out of place on any other album that wasn't OOTB.

What are your thoughts? Do you think OOTBty will make a comeback for KP7? I sure hope so. Bandaids really sounds like early Katy, so I'm excited to hear what she has in store for the new album.",3,1765668234.0,katyheads,6,0.81,False

I don’t like coffee but I love boba so maybe some cafes that serve tea.

Boba recs would be good to but I am mostly focusing on cafes.

I kinda like chai too so if there are any that have good chai that might be mixed with another flavor (banana chai for example) that would be great. Also chai that isn’t spicy.

1plz25p,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1plz25p/my_friend_told_me_to_kill_him_if_he_ever_knocked/,My friend told me to kill him if he ever knocked on my door,"I thought he was joking at first. We were sitting in my kitchen at 2 AM, lights off, drinking some coffee, because neither of us could sleep. He kept checking the windows like he expected something to be standing there.

“If I ever show up at your place unannounced,” he said, very calmly, “don’t open the door.”

I laughed it off thinking he was joking. He wasn’t.

“I’m serious,” he continued. “If I knock, if I call, if I text you asking to come in, don’t. And if I insist, if I sound desperate, you need to kill me.”

That’s when I stopped smiling and laughing all together.

I was confused, why would my friend that I’ve known for long tell me this? That’s when he told me what happened up north.

He’d gone hiking alone, deep into a stretch of forest that locals avoided. No trails, no markers, just trees that looked identical no matter how far you walked. On the third day, he realised something was following him, not stalking but keeping pace. He’d stop, and it would stop. He’d walk, and it would walk.

When he finally saw it, it was standing between two trees, half-hidden, like it hadn’t finished deciding what shape to be. “It looked almost human. Almost.”

Too tall, arms a little too long, head tilted like it was listening for instructions. When it opened its mouth, it spoke in his voice, but it used the wrong words, like it had learned language by watching someone mouth sentences through glass.

“Help me, I’m lost.” My friend ran.

That night, it stood outside his tent and practiced. He said he could hear it repeating his name over and over, changing the tone each time. Calm, panicked, angry, laughing, crying. It never touched the tent, it just learned.

By morning, there were two sets of footprints leading away from the campsite, only one set came back. When he finished telling me this, he looked smaller somehow, like something had been hollowed out.

“It followed me home,” he said. “Not right away, it waited, that’s what they do.” I told him he needed sleep, I even asked him even if he wanted to go therapy.

He grabbed my wrist hard enough to hurt. “If I come to you,” he said, eyes wide, “it means it worked.”

He left before sunrise. Two days later, he stopped answering his phone. A week later, I got a text from his number.

“can i crash at yours tonight”

No punctuation, no nickname, he has always used both. I didn’t reply.

Ten minutes later, another message.

“please man i really need help”

I locked my door, that night, there was a knock. Three slow taps, familiar rhythm, I didn’t move an inch. From the hallway outside my apartment, his voice called out, perfectly steady, “I know you’re awake.”

I stayed silent.

Something shifted on the other side of the door. A long breath, then, softer. “I told you this would happen.”

The handle turned, It didn’t open. But it turned, I didn’t sleep at all. This morning, I checked my phone, there was one last text sent at 4:12 AM.

“it’s better at being me now”

I don’t know what to do, because an hour ago, my neighbour asked why my friend was standing outside my door all night, said he never moved, said he just stood there, smiling, and waiting.

I don’t know what’s happened to my friend, but that thing, whatever it was, wasn’t him.

I'll start off by saying that I'm using a plastic V60, a cheap Bodum 12oz french press (only has one metal filter layer), a KINGrinder P2, and a Timemore Fish temp control kettle that I got recently to help with consistency. 

I'm in a bit of a pickle right now. I've been doing pour over for a while, and I've made some decent coffees but nothing close to something that wows me like what I can get at a couple local places. I more recently started doing french press and I've found I prefer the coffee that comes out of it. 

Yesterday I got an Ethiopian medium roast from my favorite local place, and I'm having a hard time getting an extraction that I like. I started with the french press, and got something that was really pleasant and had a sweet, orangey flavor. This morning I made it following the same parameters, and immediately it felt like it had this strong sort of papery taste. I tried dialing it in on pour over, and I got something acceptable but it just felt like it lacked any character. Its almost like the french press has too much body, and the pour over doesn't have enough.

Am I doing something wrong? Should I get a better french press? Should I just try a different coffee?",1,1765667840.0,pourover,20,0.67,False

First of all, how can they have the word “pastries” in their name when all their pastries look straight from Costco/Sam’s Club.

Second of all, their menu has no prices. I got an iced latte for $9 with one syrup and almond milk. People rave about their coffee and lattes but it literally tasted so mid and there was no flavor whatsoever. I’ve gotten the same specialty lattes at Desnudo, Noble Joe, Civil Goat, etc for like 7 bucks. coffee in LA was still cheaper and obviously WAY better.

Lastly, their Google reviews are hella messed up.

1plys8e,https://i.redd.it/02hrhmziz17g1.jpeg,When He Got the Boundaries He Wanted,"Chapter 1
After we got back together, Nathan became clingy.

What I ate, what I drank, who I saw—he needed a full report on everything.

One day, he called, his tone a careful probe. ""Zack brought some girls over. We're heading to the spa.""

I just said, ""Oh. Have fun.""

The line went dead.

Twenty minutes later, he was blocking my doorway, his voice a raw whisper. ""You'd just let me go off with someone else?""

I took a step back under his intense gaze. ""Isn't this the 'boundaries' you wanted?""

My words hung in the air, and he froze.

1

""Are you done?"" I asked, my voice flat. ""If you're done, you can go. I really don't mind.""

Fearing he might misunderstand, I added a thoughtful assurance. ""Don't worry, I'll play my part perfectly for your parents tomorrow.""

Nathan's face instantly darkened. ""Aria,"" he bit out, ""you're really something else.""

He slammed the door on his way out.

The commotion had completely shattered my drowsiness. I curled back into bed and scrolled through my phone.

At two in the morning, a few photos arrived from an unknown number. A young woman, clad only in a bikini, her pale skin gleaming, was straddling Nathan. Steam curled in the air around them. His arm was wrapped casually around her waist, only a thin slip of fabric separating their bodies.

Hey wifey, I'm scared of the water so Nate's holding me tight ;) So jealous you have such a caring hubby!~

I stared at the screen, considering my options.

Should I get up and go catch them in the act? But it was so late, my driver was off for the night, and getting a ride would be a nightmare.

Well then... maybe write a long, scathing essay tearing Nathan apart? The weather was too cold; my fingers would freeze.

Maybe I could just copy and paste one of my old rants from our chat history.

As I scrolled through the archives of my own fury, I somehow drifted off to sleep. No wonder Nathan never read them. When you strip away the emotion, the words are just long, rambling, and utterly exhausting. Turns out, they’re a pretty effective sedative.

The next day was New Year's. We were at the Vanderwood family estate.

I was making small talk with the elders when the doorbell chimed.

When the door opened, the girl from last night's photos stood there, a picture of shy audacity. She was clutching a pair of men's underwear.

""This... he left this at my place yesterday.""

The style was young, bold. There was only one man in this house they could possibly belong to.

The scene was painfully familiar.

The year we got engaged, another girl had shown up just like this. I’d gone ballistic, grabbing her hair and throwing her to the ground. Nathan had pulled me off her and left with the girl without a second glance, leaving me in a crumpled, humiliated heap on the floor. That night, the estate was in chaos. No one had a happy New Year. The old folks always say you shouldn't start the year on a bad note. Sure enough, that was the year Nathan and I fought the most viciously.

The living room fell silent. Everyone was waiting for my reaction.

I immediately plastered on a smile and smoothed things over. ""Oh, that's my cousin. She grew up abroad, you know how wild they can be. We were all together for New Year's Eve last night.""

Nathan's father let out a sigh of relief, but his mother's eyes were sharp with suspicion. ""Really?""

""Of course,"" I insisted, pulling the girl inside and shutting the door.

The last flicker of hope in Nathan's eyes died out.

2

On the drive back, I pulled the underwear from my pocket and tossed it at Nathan.

He stammered out an explanation. ""Last night wasn't what you think. That girl is Zack's sister, and I was drunk, I didn't do anything...""

I tore open a sanitizing wipe and began meticulously cleaning my hands.

""You can just drop me here. I'm meeting Nancy for a poker game.""

Nathan's Adam's apple bobbed. His voice softened. ""I can pick you up when you're done?""

""No need,"" I said, pushing the car door open. ""You go do your thing.""

I didn't want to know what that pair of underwear had been through. I just didn't want to be contaminated by any of it.

At Nancy's place, I took a long, hot shower and changed into a fresh set of clothes she’d laid out for me. Only then did the tight, suffocating feeling in my chest finally begin to dissolve.

Nancy watched Nathan's car drive away, then raised an eyebrow at me. ""So, how was the battle? What was the body count? And why didn't you call for backup?""

I sank into her sofa. ""There was no battle. Scaring away the man is a small loss, but what if I scare away the money tree?""

That New Year's Day years ago, the Vanderwood estate had been a war zone. Several elders had been so upset they ended up in the hospital. As I lay on the cold floor, it was Nancy who had finally come for me, bundling my mud-stained self into her sports car.

As she turned the key in the ignition, she couldn't resist a bit of dark humor. ""Trying to live out a childhood dream, were we? Making mud pies at the Vanderwood estate?""

The moment I opened my mouth, tears streamed down my face. ""Nancy, how did it get like this?""

She panicked, fumbling to wipe my tears away, but she had no answer.

No one could have predicted that Nathan and I would end up in such a toxic mess. We were childhood sweethearts, friends since we were in diapers. To get into the same university as him, I’d woken up before the chickens and gone to bed after the dogs, pouring every ounce of my being into my studies.

The day I got my acceptance letter, my mother was amazed. ""If I'd known all it took was Nathan to make you work this hard, why did I spend a fortune on all those tutors?""

Everyone just assumed that Aria and Nathan were meant to be. A package deal for life.

But just as we finally grew up, no longer needing to share a single order of street-cart fries, he was the one who let go of my hand.

He resented his family for mapping out his future, for forcing him to abandon his dream of music to take over the family corporation. That resentment found a new target in me when I joyfully accepted the engagement.

Back then, I was too blinded by my own happiness, too caught up in the fantasy of finally marrying the man I loved, to notice that the love had long since vanished from his eyes.

After the engagement, he was never home. I’d wake up to a phone flooded with ""concerned"" messages from well-meaning friends. Nathan had dropped a fortune on some model; Nathan was on a yacht surrounded by women; Nathan had thrown a mock wedding for himself somewhere...

The messages were like mold in the rainy season—impossible to scrub clean.

I used to scream, to demand answers, to lose my mind and make a scene for everyone to see. All it earned me was a deeper layer of Nathan's disgust.

""Can't you have some goddamn boundaries? You don't like it? Then go tell my mother to call off the engagement!""

Nancy once accurately described our relationship as less like a married couple and more like a rebellious teenager and his overbearing mother. One desperately trying to escape, the other clinging on for dear life.

I thought I would be tangled up with him like that forever. But then, somewhere in the middle of all the fighting, I just got tired.

Friends like Nancy don't need words. A single look is enough. Seeing my strange calm, she asked softly, ""So, what's the plan?""

I took the warm water she handed me. ""The London project... both our families have invested a lot. I'm going to go oversee it myself.""

""For how long?""

""Tentatively, three years.""

She wrapped her arms around my neck, not wanting to let go. ""Before you leave, we're going to party hard. My treat.""

""Don't you worry,"" I leaned against her shoulder with a smile. ""You won't get out of it.""

3

I was jolted awake late that night by the doorbell.

Nathan was slumped against the doorframe, drunk, his tie hanging loosely around his neck.

I glanced at my phone. The Do Not Disturb notification showed 99+ unread messages in our chat. So, he couldn't reach me and just came over.

A year ago, I would have been flattered that he'd even thought to come home while drunk. I would have bustled around, helping him inside, getting him water, fussing over him for half the night.

But now? My hair was freshly washed and fragrant, my apartment was spotless, and the last thing I wanted was the stench of a drunk man tainting it.

He saw I had no intention of letting him in and asked, his voice hoarse, ""You're just going to leave me out here?""

""You're at the wrong place,"" I said calmly. ""This is my apartment, not our marital home.""

""I'll call someone to pick you up.""

As I looked down to find a number, he shamelessly pressed closer. ""Aria... I want the soup you make.""

I took a deep breath, pushing down the last lingering sting in my heart. ""Really? You'll leave right after you have the soup?""

He nodded eagerly.

I opened the DoorDash app and held my phone out to him. ""Pick whatever kind you want.""

He froze, the alcohol seeming to evaporate from his system. ""Aria, you never let me eat this stuff...""

He was probably remembering the early days of our engagement when I, determined to be the perfect wife, had hired a chef to teach me how to cook, starting from the very basics of chopping vegetables. But he never even glanced at the food I made, let alone tasted it. I would secretly post pictures of my carefully prepared meals on Instagram, hoping the likes and comments from our mutual friends would tempt him to come home for a taste.

Instead, I overheard him laughing with his friends at a bar. ""If you had a stage-five clinger like Aria, you'd think my life was a tragedy too. Why would I eat her pig slop when I have a world of delicacies waiting for me outside?""

Amid the roar of laughter, I ran home and cried for three days straight.

Nancy was both furious and heartbroken for me. ""My darling girl, you're the type of person who'd rather starve than turn on a stove! Why are you learning to cook for a man?! He's out living it up while you're turning yourself into a ghost!""

That was my wake-up call. I never cooked for him again.

""Mine doesn't even taste good,"" I said, pushing the phone closer to him. ""Just order something.""

He sighed and took the phone. As his fingertips brushed my palm, his other hand instinctively moved to wrap around my shoulder.

I recoiled violently, my back hitting the door with a dull thud.

In the dead silence that followed, he lowered his head and lit a cigarette. The tiny flame flickered in the dark, illuminating the sharp lines of the face I once adored.

""Aria, I'm your fiancé, not a walking biohazard.""

""You never know,"" I countered, taking another half-step back. ""I need to sleep. I have work tomorrow.""

I don't know when he left. The next morning, the hallway outside my door was littered with cigarette butts.

4

On the way to the office, waiting at a red light, my mind drifted back to the night I finally broke things off.

Nathan had locked me out that night, too. But that was at our marital home. He and a crowd of people were partying inside. He'd even changed the security code.

The deep winter wind cut like a knife.

I pounded on the door, my hand instinctively cradling my stomach, my voice choked with sobs. ""Nathan, open the door... something's wrong... my stomach...""

It was the same girl from the spa who answered me through the intercom. ""Hey, you out there! Nate said the one he has to marry is the Vanderwood family, not him. You should probably go. He said you need to learn about boundaries.""

I froze for a second, then started hammering on the door like a madwoman.

The people inside must have found it amusing. They recorded me through the security camera. In the background, I could hear the spa girl's sweet, cloying voice. ""Nate, she says something's wrong?""

His voice, slurred with alcohol and thick with annoyance, came through crystal clear. ""Ignore her. She's just playing the victim.""

In the video, I looked like a deranged mess, crying and screaming. Eventually, I stopped, picked up my suitcase, and stumbled away, disappearing around the corner.

That video made the rounds in our social circle. Nathan only found out after a full day of people looking at him with expressions that screamed, You're a real piece of work. He finally, confusedly, clicked on the link.

He didn't think it was a big deal. So what? He was having a good time at home and didn't want her to come in and ruin the mood. But the Vanderwood elders were furious. They said his actions were disgraceful and had brought shame upon both families.

So he came to me, wearing the sullen expression of someone forced to apologize. ""I didn't know you would... walk out alone so late. I heard about the video."" He looked at me, as if assessing whether I'd learned my lesson. ""People are talking... saying I drove my own fiancée out onto the street... Aria, stop being so dramatic and come home.""

He never knew what happened in the darkness after the video cut off.

And I was done trying to explain.

Lying on the hospital bed, I wearily turned over. ""It's not your fault.""

On the surface, it seemed we had reconciled. But from that day on, I stopped caring where he slept or if he ever came home. I quietly moved out of our marital home and back into my own small apartment.

5

Saying it wasn't his fault was a lie. I'm no saint.

Giving up on someone you've loved for so, so long feels like tearing a part of yourself from your own flesh and bone. When the withdrawals hit, I'd lie awake all night, a gaping hole in my chest where my heart used to be, the icy wind from that winter night howling through it.

Besides, my family's fortune and the Vanderwoods' were already deeply intertwined, like the roots of two ancient trees. Tearing them apart would have consequences neither side could bear. I knew better than anyone that in the face of family interests, the squabbles of two young people were as light as a feather.

Maybe the pressure from his family scared him. Maybe he belatedly realized he'd gone too far. Whatever the reason, Nathan started to rein it in. No more all-nighters. No more ignoring my existence. Instead, he began reporting his every move to me, in excruciating detail.

One day, I was in the middle of a high-stakes negotiation, finalizing the core terms of a nine-figure project. We were at the final impasse over profit-sharing. You could hear a pin drop in the conference room. All eyes were on me, waiting for my response.

And that's when his messages started flooding my phone screen, one after another. Something about an appointment with a famous wedding dress designer; he needed to know what style I wanted. When I didn't reply, he started calling. Again. And again. The buzzing of my phone was deafeningly disruptive.

The lead negotiator on the other side said sympathetically, ""Please, take your time. It might be urgent.""

I maintained a polite smile, nodded my apologies, and ducked into the restroom before finally answering, hissing into the phone. ""What the hell do you want? Why are you blowing up my phone over something so trivial? Are you that bored? Can't you have some goddamn boundaries?!""

After my tirade, the line went dead silent.

I was the first to snap out of it, rubbing my temples wearily. ""I'm sorry. I've been pulling all-nighters for this project, I'm just exhausted. The style... you can just pick one for me.""

On the other end of the line, Nathan was quiet for a long time before he finally managed a strained, ""Okay.""

6

The car pulled up in front of the Vanderwood Corporation headquarters. I was here to consolidate some resources before heading back to my own company.

In the breakroom, I overheard some colleagues gossiping.

""Did you see? Mr. Vanderwood came in with her again this morning.""

""I know! I heard he even left his underwear at her place last time...""

""What is with that? Isn't he engaged?""

""Please, everyone knows how much he can't stand Miss Aria. He's always saying he wishes she would just disappear.""

...

Thanks to Nathan's strict policy of never acknowledging our relationship at the office, I, Miss Aria herself, was privy to all the juiciest gossip.

I lowered my eyes and sipped my coffee, feeling nothing. This little scandal was nothing. These people were amateurs. They'd never seen a female delivery driver show up late at night wearing a matching set of lacy lingerie underneath her uniform. They'd never had to deal with the mountains of explicit late-night texts on his phone. They'd certainly never been toasted at a family banquet by some random girl who called me 'sis' as if we were best friends.

Nathan never said no to anyone outside our home, and I was always the one left to clean up his messes. A pair of forgotten underwear barely even registered on the scale of his transgressions.

I fought the urge to go over and say something. Then I looked up and saw that the subject of the gossip was standing right in front of me.

The girl from the spa—the one who was ""afraid of water""—was clinging to Nathan as if she had no bones of her own. When Nathan saw me, he frowned and told her to stand up straight. I took a second look. Of all his flings, she had certainly lasted the longest.

The girl pouted and shoved a file into my hands. ""You're the one from his house, aren't you?""

I took the file and met her gaze. ""And you're the one who sat on him in a bikini at the spa.""

The breakroom went dead quiet.

Her face paled. She bit her lip and demanded, ""Can't you just let him go?""

I held up my hands in surrender. Don't drag me into this, kid. I'm just trying to get my materials and get out of the country.

In a moment of desperate inspiration, my voice rising an octave, I threw Nathan's own excuse back at them. ""You call him 'bro,' I call him 'bro.' What's this about letting him go or not?""

""Aria.""

Nathan's warning tone came from behind me. ""What nonsense are you spouting now?""

I waved the file in my hand and turned to press the elevator button. ""Bro, deal with your own drama. Leave me out of it.""

The elevator doors slowly slid shut, reflecting Nathan's thunderous expression and the hurt look on the girl's face beside him. Were they having another fight? Not my problem.

I glanced down at the flight confirmation email on my phone. In twenty-four hours, I would be gone.

7

I'd partied too hard with Nancy the night before, so I was barely holding it together at Nathan's grandfather's banquet.

I placed my prepared gifts on the table. The first was a rare bottle of aged whiskey, a toast to the old man's good health.

The second was the heirloom sapphire bracelet his grandfather had personally placed on my wrist at our engagement party. Today, I was returning it. The message couldn't be clearer.

I stood behind Grandpa Vanderwood and gently massaged his shoulders. ""Grandpa, I'm begging you, please grant my request to break off the engagement with Nathan.""

He grew agitated. ""Did that boy force you into this?""

I shook my head, my voice soft but firm. ""This is my decision. The love is gone. This engagement is meaningless."" I added, ""I will personally oversee the London project. I won't let the interests of our two families suffer.""

Grandpa Vanderwood looked at the sapphire bracelet, then let out a long sigh. ""The Vanderwood family has wronged you."" He paused for a moment, then added, ""For the London project, you will have full authority. On top of the original terms, the Vanderwood family will grant an additional five percent of the profits to you personally. Consider it a small token from an old man.""

""Thank you, Grandpa,"" I said with a small smile, not refusing the offer. I had earned it.

My flight was in two hours. I offered a final toast and made my excuses to leave early. As the car pulled away, I took one last look at the grand estate where Nathan and I had grown up together, from innocent playmates to deeply entangled lovers.

Now, the story was over, and I was the only one walking off the stage.

As we turned the corner, I saw Nathan's car pulling into the driveway. I could just make out the silhouette of the spa girl in the passenger seat.

Our cars passed each other, going in opposite directions.

Nathan, I hope you get everything you ever wanted. And I hope my future is limitless.

8

Nathan rushed into the banquet hall, but he couldn't find the familiar figure he was looking for. He sidled up to his grandfather, feigning a casual tone. ""What did Aria get you?""

His grandfather swirled the whiskey in his glass, then pushed another velvet box toward him.

Inside lay the solitary sapphire bracelet. The thing she had treasured above all else, now returned by her own hand.

A knot of anxiety tightened in Nathan's chest. ""Where is she?""

Grandpa Vanderwood took a sip of his drink, his voice betraying no emotion. ""Gone. She said she's setting you free. The engagement is off."" He glanced pointedly at the spa girl who had followed Nathan in. ""You should be happy now.""

Nathan stood there, stunned. His first feeling was an overwhelming wave of exhaustion. He thought of all his clumsy attempts to change—calling her even when he was drunk, learning to cook for her, even taking charge of the wedding dress selection... He had done so much, had bent so far.

And she was still throwing a tantrum.

A hot surge of anger, the anger of being played for a fool, rose in his throat. Knowing Aria, she was probably already on a flight to London. He furiously typed out a message to Nancy.

[Was it fun playing games with me?]

[Did you two get a kick out of watching me run around like an idiot, trying to change for her?]

Nancy didn't reply with a single word.

Instead, she sent him a link to a surveillance video. It was from a convenience store not far from their marital home.",1,1765667367.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

--- Story ---

Chapter 1
After we got back together, Nathan became clingy.

What I ate, what I drank, who I saw—he needed a full report on everything.

One day, he called, his tone a careful probe. ""Zack brought some girls over. We're heading to the spa.""

I just said, ""Oh. Have fun.""

The line went dead.

Twenty minutes later, he was blocking my doorway, his voice a raw whisper. ""You'd just let me go off with someone else?""

I took a step back under his intense gaze. ""Isn't this the 'boundaries' you wanted?""

My words hung in the air, and he froze.

1

""Are you done?"" I asked, my voice flat. ""If you're done, you can go. I really don't mind.""

Fearing he might misunderstand, I added a thoughtful assurance. ""Don't worry, I'll play my part perfectly for your parents tomorrow.""

Nathan's face instantly darkened. ""Aria,"" he bit out, ""you're really something else.""

He slammed the door on his way out.

The commotion had completely shattered my drowsiness. I curled back into bed and scrolled through my phone.

At two in the morning, a few photos arrived from an unknown number. A young woman, clad only in a bikini, her pale skin gleaming, was straddling Nathan. Steam curled in the air around them. His arm was wrapped casually around her waist, only a thin slip of fabric separating their bodies.

Hey wifey, I'm scared of the water so Nate's holding me tight ;) So jealous you have such a caring hubby!~

I stared at the screen, considering my options.

Should I get up and go catch them in the act? But it was so late, my driver was off for the night, and getting a ride would be a nightmare.

Well then... maybe write a long, scathing essay tearing Nathan apart? The weather was too cold; my fingers would freeze.

Maybe I could just copy and paste one of my old rants from our chat history.

As I scrolled through the archives of my own fury, I somehow drifted off to sleep. No wonder Nathan never read them. When you strip away the emotion, the words are just long, rambling, and utterly exhausting. Turns out, they’re a pretty effective sedative.

The next day was New Year's. We were at the Vanderwood family estate.

I was making small talk with the elders when the doorbell chimed.

When the door opened, the girl from last night's photos stood there, a picture of shy audacity. She was clutching a pair of men's underwear.

""This... he left this at my place yesterday.""

The style was young, bold. There was only one man in this house they could possibly belong to.

The scene was painfully familiar.

The year we got engaged, another girl had shown up just like this. I’d gone ballistic, grabbing her hair and throwing her to the ground. Nathan had pulled me off her and left with the girl without a second glance, leaving me in a crumpled, humiliated heap on the floor. That night, the estate was in chaos. No one had a happy New Year.

The last flicker of hope in Nathan's eyes died out.

On the surface, it seemed we had reconciled. But from that day on, I stopped caring where he slept or if he ever came home. I quietly moved out of our marital home and back into my own small apartment.

Saying it wasn't his fault was a lie. I'm no saint.

Giving up on someone you've loved for so, so long feels like tearing a part of yourself from your own flesh and bone. When the withdrawals hit, I'd lie awake all night, a gaping hole in my chest where my heart used to be, the icy wind from that winter night howling through it.

Besides, my family's fortune and the Vanderwoods' were already deeply intertwined, like the roots of two ancient trees. Tearing them apart would have consequences neither side could bear. I knew better than anyone that in the face of family interests, the squabbles of two young people were as light as a feather.

Maybe the pressure from his family scared him. Maybe he belatedly realized he'd gone too far. Whatever the reason, Nathan started to rein it in. No more all-nighters. No more ignoring my existence. Instead, he began reporting his every move to me, in excruciating detail.

One day, I was in the middle of a high-stakes negotiation, finalizing the core terms of a nine-figure project. We were at the final impasse over profit-sharing. You could hear a pin drop in the conference room. All eyes were on me, waiting for my response.

And that's when his messages started flooding my phone screen, one after another. Something about an appointment with a famous wedding dress designer; he needed to know what style I wanted. When I didn't reply, he started calling. Again. And again. The buzzing of my phone was deafeningly disruptive.

The lead negotiator on the other side said sympathetically, ""Please, take your time. It might be urgent.""

I maintained a polite smile, nodded my apologies, and ducked into the restroom before finally answering, hissing into the phone. ""What the hell do you want? Why are you blowing up my phone over something so trivial? Are you that bored? Can't you have some goddamn boundaries?!""

After my tirade, the line went dead silent.

I was the first to snap out of it, rubbing my temples wearily. ""I'm sorry. I've been pulling all-nighters for this project, I'm just exhausted. The style... you can just pick one for me.""

On the other end of the line, Nathan was quiet for a long time before he finally managed a strained, ""Okay.""

The car pulled up in front of the Vanderwood Corporation headquarters. I was here to consolidate some resources before heading back to my own company.

In the breakroom, I overheard some colleagues gossiping.

""Did you see? Mr. Vanderwood came in with her again this morning.""

""I know! I heard he even left his underwear at her place last time...""

""What is with that? Isn't he engaged?""

""Please, everyone knows how much he can't stand Miss Aria. He's always saying he wishes she would just disappear.""

...

Thanks to Nathan's strict policy of never acknowledging our relationship at the office, I, Miss Aria herself, was privy to all the juiciest gossip.

I lowered my eyes and sipped my coffee, feeling nothing. This little scandal was nothing. These people were amateurs. They'd never seen a female delivery driver show up late at night wearing a matching set of lacy lingerie underneath her uniform. They'd never had to deal with the mountains of explicit late-night texts on his phone. They'd certainly never been toasted at a family banquet by some random girl who called me 'sis' as if we were best friends.

Nathan never said no to anyone outside our home, and I was always the one left to clean up his messes. A pair of forgotten underwear barely even registered on the scale of his transgressions.

I fought the urge to go over and say something. Then I looked up and saw that the subject of the gossip was standing right in front of me.

The girl from the spa—the one who was ""afraid of water""—was clinging to Nathan as if she had no bones of her own. When Nathan saw me, he frowned and told her to stand up straight. I took a second look. Of all his flings, she had certainly lasted the longest.

The girl pouted and shoved a file into my hands. ""You're the one from his house, aren't you?""

I took the file and met her gaze. ""And you're the one who sat on him in a bikini at the spa.""

The breakroom went dead quiet.

Her face paled. She bit her lip and demanded, ""Can't you just let him go?""

I held up my hands in surrender. Don't drag me into this, kid. I'm just trying to get my materials and get out of the country.

In a moment of desperate inspiration, my voice rising an octave, I threw Nathan's own excuse back at them. ""You call him 'bro,' I call him 'bro.' What's this about letting him go or not?""

""Aria.""

Nathan's warning tone came from behind me. ""What nonsense are you spouting now?""

I waved the file in my hand and turned to press the elevator button. ""Bro, deal with your own drama. Leave me out of it.""

The elevator doors slowly slid shut, reflecting Nathan's thunderous expression and the hurt look on the girl's face beside him. Were they having another fight? Not my problem.

I glanced down at the flight confirmation email on my phone. In twenty-four hours, I would be gone.

I'd partied too hard with Nancy the night before, so I was barely holding it together at Nathan's grandfather's banquet.

I placed my prepared gifts on the table. The first was a rare bottle of aged whiskey, a toast to the old man's good health.

The second was the heirloom sapphire bracelet his grandfather had personally placed on my wrist at our engagement party. Today, I was returning it. The message couldn't be clearer.

I stood behind Grandpa Vanderwood and gently massaged his shoulders. ""Grandpa, I'm begging you, please grant my request to break off the engagement with Nathan.""

He grew agitated. ""Did that boy force you into this?""

I shook my head, my voice soft but firm. ""This is my decision. The love is gone. This engagement is meaningless."" I added, ""I will personally oversee the London project. I won't let the interests of our two families suffer.""

Grandpa Vanderwood looked at the sapphire bracelet, then let out a long sigh. ""The Vanderwood family has wronged you."" He paused for a moment, then added, ""For the London project, you will have full authority. On top of the original terms, the Vanderwood family will grant an additional five percent of the profits to you personally. Consider it a small token from an old man.""

""Thank you, Grandpa,"" I said with a small smile, not refusing the offer. I had earned it.

My flight was in two hours. I offered a final toast and made my excuses to leave early. As the car pulled away, I took one last look at the grand estate where Nathan and I had grown up together, from innocent playmates to deeply entangled lovers.

Now, the story was over, and I was the only one walking off the stage.

As we turned the corner, I saw Nathan's car pulling into the driveway. I could just make out the silhouette of the spa girl in the passenger seat.

Our cars passed each other, going in opposite directions.

Nathan, I hope you get everything you ever wanted. And I hope my future is limitless.

Nathan rushed into the banquet hall, but he couldn't find the familiar figure he was looking for. He sidled up to his grandfather, feigning a casual tone. ""What did Aria get you?""

His grandfather swirled the whiskey in his glass, then pushed another velvet box toward him.

Inside lay the solitary sapphire bracelet. The thing she had treasured above all else, now returned by her own hand.

A knot of anxiety tightened in Nathan's chest. ""Where is she?""

Grandpa Vanderwood took a sip of his drink, his voice betraying no emotion. ""Gone. She said she's setting you free. The engagement is off."" He glanced pointedly at the spa girl who had followed Nathan in. ""You should be happy now.""

Nathan stood there, stunned. His first feeling was an overwhelming wave of exhaustion. He thought of all his clumsy attempts to change—calling her even when he was drunk, learning to cook for her, even taking charge of the wedding dress selection... He had done so much, had bent so far.

And she was still throwing a tantrum.

A hot surge of anger, the anger of being played for a fool, rose in his throat. Knowing Aria, she was probably already on a flight to London. He furiously typed out a message to Nancy.

[Was it fun playing games with me?]

[Did you two get a kick out of watching me run around like an idiot, trying to change for her?]

Nancy didn't reply with a single word.

Instead, she sent him a link to a surveillance video. It was from a convenience store not far from their marital home.",1,1765667342.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False
