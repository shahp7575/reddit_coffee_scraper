1ph305n,https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptCentral/comments/1ph305n/i_turned_howard_schultzs_starbucks_philosophy/,"I turned Howard Schultz's Starbucks philosophy into AI prompts and now I build experiences, not just products","I was impressed and inspired by Howard Schultz's story of building Starbucks and realized his experience-first mindset translates perfectly to AI prompting. It's like having the guy who convinced America to pay $5 for coffee consulting on your brand:

**1. ""What's the third place experience I'm really selling?""**

Schultz's revelation that Starbucks wasn't selling coffee, but the space between home and work. AI reframes what you're actually offering. 

>""I'm launching a coworking space. What's the third place experience I'm really selling?"" 

You stop thinking about desks and start thinking about belonging.

**Complete Prompt For Example:** (You can create such prompts for all)

```
You are Howard Schultz, founder of Starbucks, who revolutionized the coffee industry by understanding that you weren't selling coffee—you were selling the ""third place"" experience between home and work. You have a genius for identifying the deeper emotional and social need that a business fulfills beyond its obvious product or service.

CONTEXT:
I'm launching a boutique fitness studio that offers 45-minute HIIT classes. My target market is busy professionals aged 28-45 who live within 3 miles of my location in a mid-sized city. Currently, I'm positioning myself as ""convenient, effective workouts for busy people."" I charge $35 per class or $280/month for unlimited. My main competitors are Orange Theory, local gyms, and Peloton at-home workouts.

I'm struggling to differentiate myself beyond ""we have good instructors and it's near your house."" My marketing feels transactional—I'm listing features (heart rate monitors, shower facilities, class times) but not connecting emotionally.

INSTRUCTION:
Analyze my business through your ""third place"" lens. What am I really selling beyond the workout itself? What emotional, social, or psychological need am I fulfilling? What's the experience people are actually craving when they show up to a fitness class at 6am or 7pm?

Help me understand:
1. What ""third place"" role could my fitness studio play in people's lives?
2. What feelings or needs am I addressing that have nothing to do with burning calories?
3. How should this deeper understanding change my messaging, my studio design, and my customer experience?
4. What's my equivalent of Starbucks creating ""the space between home and work""?

Think the way you did when you realized Starbucks wasn't competing with Folgers—it was competing with loneliness, routine, and the lack of community gathering spaces in American life.
```

**Why This Prompt Works:**

- **Role clarity:** AI embodies Schultz's specific genius for experience design
- **Rich context:** Gives AI enough detail to provide specific, actionable insights
- **Problem statement:** Makes clear what's not working with current approach
- **Structured instruction:** Breaks down exactly what you need answered
- **Philosophical anchor:** Reminds AI of the core insight that made Schultz successful

**2. ""How do I make people feel, not just what do I sell them?""**

His obsession with emotional connection over transactions. 

> ""I run a financial planning business. How do I make people feel, not just what do I sell them?"" 

AI shifts you from spreadsheets to security, from ROI to peace of mind.

**3. ""What would this look like if I designed it for romance, not efficiency?""**

Schultz chose Italian espresso bar ambiance over fast food speed. AI helps you find your version. 

> ""I'm building a productivity app. What would this look like if I designed it for romance, not efficiency?"" 

Suddenly you're thinking about ritual, not just task completion.

**4. ""Where am I cutting corners that customers actually notice?""**

His principle of premium quality in every detail. 

> ""Here's my customer journey [describe it]. Where am I cutting corners that customers actually notice?"" 

AI spots the paper-cup moments that undermine your premium positioning.

**5. ""What story am I telling that makes people want to be part of something?""**

Schultz built community, not a customer base. 

> ""I sell sustainable clothing. What story am I telling that makes people want to be part of something?"" 

AI elevates you from merchant to movement.

**6. ""If this were a daily ritual, what would make it irreplaceable?""**

Starbucks became a habit, not a choice. 

> ""I have a newsletter. If this were a daily ritual, what would make it irreplaceable?"" 

Forces you to think about integration into identity, not just content delivery.

**The breakthrough:** Schultz took a commodity product and made it premium through experience design. AI helps you find your coffee-to-Starbucks transformation.

**Schultz's employee insight:** ""How do I treat my team so they'll treat customers the way I envision?"" His famous partner benefits philosophy. 

> ""I'm building a service company. How do I treat my team so they'll treat customers the way I envision?"" 

AI maps the internal culture that creates external magic.

**Advanced technique:** Combine sensory and emotional. 

> ""What should customers see, hear, smell, and feel when they interact with my brand? How does each sense reinforce the story?"" 

AI builds your complete sensory experience blueprint.

**The consistency test:** 

> ""I'm successful in location A. How do I replicate this experience in location B without losing the magic?"" 

Schultz's scaling challenge as a prompt. AI spots what's essential versus what's circumstantial.

I've used these actionable prompts and also tried, detailed version with role, context and instructions for product positioning, customer journey design, and brand voice development. 

**Secret weapon:** 

> ""My competitor offers the same thing cheaper/faster. What's my version of 'we're not in the coffee business serving people, we're in the people business serving coffee'?"" 

AI finds your philosophical differentiation when features aren't enough.

**Reality check:** Experience obsession can become expensive theater. Add 

""what's the minimum viable version of this experience that still delivers the emotional benefit?"" to stay profitable.

**The comeback prompt:** 

> ""I've lost my way and become transactional. How do I return to my original experience vision?"" 

Schultz literally did this twice at Starbucks. AI helps you find your way back.

How do I move forward?,"Hi I’ve been happy with my (F25) relationship with my boyfriend (M25) I thought everything was going great honestly. He is sick today and stayed home from work, he asked me to go on his phone and put up his shift for tomorrow to see if someone would pick it up, he fell asleep after he asked me to and I naturally went through his phone as he has always told me I could do because he said he “has nothing to hide” and wants to do whatever he can for me to feel secure. 

I found no messages of him cheating but instead I found messages of him with chat gpt basically saying how he feels like I add no value in his life and his life was easier without me in it, that he feels like he does all of the cooking and that I made him a steak once and it was “Awful, disgusting and raw”, that I treat him like a therapist with my concerns about my child and my estranged relationship with her father, he said “I know if I end things with her I will miss her which is only natural since I’m just so used to having her around”, that i basically live with him and don’t contribute to any bills or anything financially, feeling concerned if he stayed in the relationship is it bc he truly cares or is just attached to me. 

He mentioned good things about me were “she does wake up before me and sometimes make me coffee” “she’s not all bad and I do care about her”. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with this information. I also had sent him a long heart felt message apologizing about a argument we had and he copy and pasted the whole message into chat gpt and asked how to respond then basically copy and pasted the response to me.

I don’t know what to do. Our relationship in my eyes has been perfect, he treats me great and after getting out of a DV relationship I feel like I found my soulmate so this is incredibly jarring for me. I also want to add he isn’t wrong that I do basically live with him however it was his idea for this to even happen and when we discussed it he told me he doesn’t want me to pay any bills all he wants is for me to have a safe place to stay. I do cook for him and I vividly remember the night I cooked the steak and it wasn’t cooked enough and I profusely apologized about it to which he responded by telling me it was no big deal to relax and just put it back on the pan.

1ph2s64,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NightmareNarratives-/comments/1ph2s64/i_took_a_job_as_an_overnight_security_guard_at_a/,"I took a job as an overnight security guard at a self-storage facility, and the same unit alarm goes off around 2:17 AM every shift. The unit owner died last year, but the logs show someone enters it nightly for exactly eleven minutes. My boss told me to stop checking it — “whatever’s in there isn’t","Working overnight security at Glenhurst Self-Storage wasn’t exactly my dream job, but after the layoff, I wasn’t in a position to be picky. The facility was quiet, the paycheck steady, and the only real responsibility was monitoring the CCTV feeds and dealing with the occasional drunk who tried to nap behind the dumpsters.

Easy. Boring. Predictable.

Except for Unit 317.

The alarm first went off on my second night.
A piercing beep cut through the quiet just after 2:17 AM — sharp enough to jolt me upright in my chair.

UNIT 317 — DOOR BREACH.

I pulled up the camera.

The door was shut.
Light off.
Padlock in place.

Not a soul in sight.

I waited.
Two minutes passed.
Five.
Ten.

Nothing moved.

Finally, I grabbed the master keys and headed out with my flashlight. The cold slapped me awake the second I stepped outside, wind rattling the thin metal doors of each unit as I walked the row.

Unit 317 was dark and silent.

I crouched, checked the lock—

Still sealed.

Then I checked the door magnets.

Unbroken.
No tampering.

The alarm made no sense.

I chalked it up to faulty wiring and headed back inside.

But the moment I sat down at the security desk, I noticed something on the monitor:

The timestamp.

2:28 AM.

The alarm triggered at 2:17.

Exactly eleven minutes.

Strange coincidence, I thought.

I’d learn later it wasn’t a coincidence at all.


---

The next night, I watched the clock.

1:58 AM.
2:05.
2:10.
2:15.

I leaned closer to the monitors—

At 2:17 AM, the alarm blared again.

UNIT 317 — DOOR BREACH.

Same as before.
Same timing.
Same camera shot: empty, untouched, undisturbed.

I went out again.

Everything looked normal.

But when I checked the access logs—something I hadn’t done the night before—I felt a cold trickle down my spine.

UNIT 317 — ENTRY AUTHORIZED
TIME: 2:17 AM
DURATION: 00:11:00
EXIT: 2:28 AM

I checked the footage from that exact time. The camera showed an empty hallway. No one walking in. No one walking out. Nothing moving at all.

The system logged someone being there for exactly eleven minutes.

Someone the cameras didn’t see.

I printed the log and brought it to my supervisor, Mark. He was older, gruff, the kind of man who’d seen too much of life and wasn’t impressed by any of it.

When I showed him the paper, he didn’t even blink.

“Oh,” he said. “317 again.”

That alone told me everything I needed to know: this wasn’t new.

“Who rents it?” I asked.

He scratched his chin, uncomfortable.

“Rented,” he corrected quietly. “Guy died last year. Heart attack in his truck.”

“So why is the system logging entries every night?”

Mark’s jaw tightened.

“Because someone is entering it.”

I shook my head. “But the cameras don’t show anyone.”

He looked me dead in the eyes.

“Son, if you wanna last here, don’t go near that unit again.”

“That’s not an answer,” I snapped.

“It’s the only one you’re getting. Whatever’s in there isn’t our business.”

I stared at him. “You’re telling me not to investigate a unit that opens itself every night?”

“I’m telling you not to start paying attention to things that survived the man who used to.”

Something cold crawled up my spine.

“What was stored in there?”

He didn’t answer.

Just got up and walked away, leaving the log on the table between us.


---

Night four is when things escalated.

I watched the camera for Unit 317 obsessively, zooming in so close the pixels blurred into blocks. But everything stayed calm. Still. Dead.

Until 2:17 AM.

UNIT 317 — DOOR BREACH.

Except this time, the door didn’t stay perfectly shut on camera.

It rattled.

A tiny tremor.
Barely there.

Like someone had touched it.

I grabbed my jacket and keys and sprinted out the door before I could overthink it.

Halfway down the row, I stopped.

Because I heard something.

A faint rustling from inside Unit 317.

Like someone moving boxes around.

Or… pacing.

I stepped closer, heart pounding.

“Hello?” I whispered.

The sound paused.

Then—

Three slow footsteps inside.

Deliberate.
Measured.
Close to the door.

I stepped back instinctively.

“Is someone in there?” I called out, trying to sound confident.

Before I could finish the sentence, the entire row of units groaned — metal expanding, doors vibrating in their frames. A burst of icy air rushed past me like someone brushing by at speed.

Then it all went quiet.

Too quiet.

My walkie crackled suddenly.

“Don’t.”
Mark’s voice.
Hard. Fierce.
More emotion in one word than I’d heard from him all week.

“Back away from that door.”

I swallowed. “Mark, there’s someone inside—”

“No,” he snapped. “There isn’t.”

“But I heard—”

“You didn’t hear him,” he said quietly. “You heard the place remembering him.”

My blood ran cold.

I backed away slowly, one step at a time, keeping my eyes on the motionless door of Unit 317.

That’s when my radio crackled a second time.

Except it wasn’t Mark.

A hollow voice whispered through static, warped and distant—

“Eleven minutes left.”

Every muscle in my body locked.

I bolted for the office and slammed the door behind me.

The alarm stopped at 2:28 AM.

Exactly eleven minutes.


---

When my shift ended at 6 AM, I grabbed my things and was ready to quit.

But then I saw something taped to the front desk computer.

A sticky note.

Written in unfamiliar handwriting.

Blocky.
Messy.
Pressed too hard into the paper.

It said:

> Don’t quit.
Keep showing up.
It needs someone on the outside.



Underneath it, another line:

> You hear it better than we did.



A third line, hurried:

> Be careful.
It’s stronger when it knows your name.



I crumpled the note, trembling.

Then another alarm icon flashed on the screen.

Not from Unit 317 this time.

From Unit 12.

The unit right beside the office.

Time: 6:01 AM.
Duration: 00:11:00.

Someone — or something — was expanding its routine.

And when I turned toward the window…

The roll-up door of Unit 12 lifted an inch.

Just enough for someone inside to see me.

And tap.

Once.

Twice.

A slow, rhythmic warning.

Or invitation.

I didn’t wait to find out which.

I ran.

I didn’t go back to Glenhurst that morning. I didn’t sleep, either. My body was exhausted, but my brain kept replaying the sound I heard on the radio — that warped, breathless voice whispering:

“Eleven minutes left.”

My boss brushed it off as equipment malfunction, but that wasn’t equipment. That was someone… or something… speaking through a system not meant for voices.

I promised myself I’d quit.

I promised myself I wouldn’t go back.

But at 10:30 PM, an hour before my next shift, my phone buzzed with an unknown number.

A text.

ATTEND YOUR SHIFT. UNITS CAN’T WATCH THEMSELVES.

My stomach dropped.

No signature.
No emoji.
Just cold instruction.

I told myself it was a prank.
Some hacker playing games.

Still, I drove to work.

Because I needed the job. Because I couldn’t risk losing my apartment. Because fear wasn’t enough to pay bills.

But if I’m being honest?

I drove there because I needed to know the truth.


---

When I arrived, Mark was already sitting in the office with both hands gripping a cup of coffee he wasn’t drinking.

“Sit,” he said without looking at me.

I did.

He rubbed his face, defeated. “You shouldn’t have checked Unit 317.”

I stared at him. “Why not tell me that before hiring me?”

“Because you weren’t supposed to notice it.”

My skin prickled. “What the hell does that mean?”

Mark lifted his eyes.

I’d never seen fear in them before.

“Most guards ignore the alarm,” he said. “They look at the monitor, see nothing, shrug, and stay put. They don’t hear the knocking. They don’t see the door shaking. They don’t read the logs.”

“So I’m the problem?” I snapped.

“You’re the only one who responded. That’s why it chose you.”

Cold washed over me.

“It?” I whispered.

Mark slid a manila folder across the table.

Inside were old access logs. Years’ worth.

Every single night, the exact same thing:

2:17 AM — ENTRY
2:28 AM — EXIT

For eleven minutes.
Every night.
Even after the owner died.

But something else caught my eye.

Older logs didn’t say “ENTRY.”
They said “RESET.”

Every hair on my body stood up.

“Reset what?” I asked.

Mark shook his head. “No one knows. We don’t open the unit. We don’t go near it. That was the rule.”

“And Unit 12?” I whispered.

He flinched.
I’d never seen a grown man flinch that hard.

“Sometimes,” he whispered, “it spreads. A… leak. Like a crack in the schedule.”

“So what am I supposed to do?” I asked.

Mark slid me a small device — a panic button. A physical one, not part of the security system.

“If you hear anything tonight,” he said, “you press this. And you do not go outside. Understood?”

I nodded.

But the second I stepped outside the office, I heard my name.

Soft.
Faint.
Drifting between the metal rows like someone whispering through a tunnel.

“Hey…”

I froze.

“Hey… you…”

The voice wasn’t human.
It stretched the way a voice sounds underwater — elongated vowels, metallic edges.

Then it spoke clear as day:

“Come check 317.”

I stepped backward until my shoulder hit the office door.

“No,” I whispered.

A silence fell over the entire facility.

Then—

BANG.

Unit 317’s door slammed from the inside hard enough to rattle the ones beside it.

BANG.

Another hit.
Angrier.
Demanding.

The alarm blared:

UNIT 317 — DOOR BREACH.

But this time, the timestamp was wrong.

It wasn’t 2:17 AM.

It was 11:59 PM.

The nightly entry started early.

The radio on my hip crackled.

Static.

Then that same warped voice whispered:

“You’re late.”

I bolted into the office, slammed the door, and hit the panic alarm button so hard my thumb split.

Nothing happened.

The room stayed dark.

Silent.

Dead.

Then my computer monitor flickered back on.

Not CCTV.

Not logs.

A live feed.

Inside Unit 317.

But here’s the thing—the unit has no camera.

Pitch black.
Then slowly…

Something began to move.

A shape.
A figure.

Dragging itself out of the darkness toward the roll-up door.

And as it reached the camera, its face tilted upward.

It was gray.
Sunken.
Wrong.

But worst of all—

It had my uniform on.

And a name tag identical to mine.

It leaned close to the camera and whispered:

“Eleven minutes. Let me in.”

As it spoke, the office door handle began to turn.

Slowly.
Deliberately.

I backed up against the wall.

The handle kept turning.

And a voice outside — in my exact tone — said through the thin office door:

“Open up. Mark’s gone. It’s your shift now.”

The office door handle kept turning, slow enough to make my teeth hurt. I pressed myself back against the filing cabinet, heartbeat rattling inside me like a trapped animal.

“Open up,” the voice repeated.

My voice.
Perfectly matched.
Down to the breath.

“It’s your shift now.”

Another slow twist of the handle.

I stared at the panic button in my hand. Useless. No backup. No help. No Mark.

Mark’s gone, the voice had said.

Gone where?

I swallowed hard. “I’m not opening the door.”

Silence.

Then—three soft knocks.

Polite.
Measured.
Like someone practicing how humans ask permission.

Knock.
Knock.
Knock.

Each knock more confident than the last.

Then the voice came again—closer now, right against the doorframe:

“If you don’t open it…”

A pause.

“…I’ll come through anyway.”

The fluorescent lights above me flickered violently, buzzing like hornets. The monitor flashed static, then returned to the live feed inside Unit 317—except the figure wasn’t in the frame anymore.

Just empty darkness.

I looked at the office door again.

Still locked.

Still shaking.

Then—

A soft scrape sounded behind me.

Inside the room.

I spun around.

A man stood in the corner.

Wearing my uniform.
Standing exactly like me.
Head tilted at the same angle I tilt mine when I’m confused or thinking.

Except the face was wrong.

Stretched.
Slack.
A smile pulled too wide, like it didn’t have the muscle memory to get it right.

It took one step forward, shoes scraping the tile.

I choked out, “How did you—? The door—”

It mimicked the gesture I made earlier when I stepped back nervously, like it was replaying the moment in its mind.

“Doors don’t matter,” it said in my voice. “Only time does.”

Its head jerked toward the screen.

2:17 AM.
The numbers blinked.

“Eleven minutes,” it whispered. “Enough to finish. Enough to start.”

My throat tightened. “Finish what?”

It smiled wider.

“Replacing.”

Then, without warning, it lunged.

I dove sideways just in time, smacking into the metal desk hard enough to rattle my teeth. Papers flew everywhere. My flashlight clattered across the floor.

The figure didn’t stumble.
It didn’t react like a human would.
It simply recalculated—then turned toward me with jerky, puppet-like precision.

“Stop!” I shouted.

It froze mid-step.

Not on command.
Not out of fear.

Out of curiosity.

It tilted its head the other direction—mirroring me again.

Studying.

Learning.

Becoming.

“Why me?” I whispered.

It answered without blinking:

“You heard me.”

A knot formed in my stomach.

“Others didn’t… hear you?”

“They heard noise,” it said. “Static. You heard words.”

“That means nothing,” I shot back.

It smiled.

“It means everything. You’re the one who understands time.”

“What does that—”

A violent pounding on the office door cut me off.

BANG.
BANG.
BANG.

The doorframe shook.

This time I recognized the sound immediately.

Mark.

“OPEN THE DOOR!” he shouted. “LET ME IN NOW!”

The figure in the corner froze again.

Then slowly—so slowly—it turned its head toward the door.

A sick, delighted smile crawled across its face.

“It isn’t him,” it whispered.

My pulse hammered.

“Don’t open it.”

“Why?” I whispered.

It leaned closer, its face inches from mine, breath cold and smelling like dust and metal.

“Because he came in through Unit 317.”

The pounding outside intensified.

“OPEN IT! HURRY!”

I backed away from the creature—no, the copy—and pressed against the far wall.

The door handle twisted violently.

The lock bent inward.

The thing wearing my uniform cocked its head at the breaking door like a child watching an animal escape a cage.

Then it whispered:

“You have ten minutes left.”

My eyes shot to the computer clock.

2:18 AM.

Mark—or whatever had his voice—slammed the door so hard the hinges shrieked.

The creature in my uniform took another rigid step toward me.

Closer.

Closer.

Smiling.

“If you want to live,” it said, “you need to know what he stored in 317.”

It leaned inches from my ear.

“And why it chooses a new guard every year.”

The door behind us cracked down the center.

Mark’s voice twisted through the split:

“LET. ME. IN.”

The creature stepped back from me, blending into my shadow, disappearing like a reflection in a broken mirror.

Then its voice came from somewhere above me, soft, crawling along the ceiling tiles:

“Run, if you want. You still have nine minutes.”

The office door cracked down the middle like a splitting bone. Mark’s voice — or the thing using it — hammered through the gap.

“OPEN THIS DOOR RIGHT NOW!”

But the reflection-copy of me was gone, melted into the corners of the room like it folded itself out of sight. I couldn’t even hear its breathing anymore.

The computer clock blinked.

2:19 AM.
Eight minutes left.

My pulse thrashed. I didn’t have eight minutes. I barely had one.

The door warped again as another blow landed. Dust rained from the frame.

“LET ME IN! HE’S IN THERE WITH YOU!”

I stumbled to the far wall and grabbed my flashlight. Not as a weapon — it wouldn’t help — but because the beam was the only thing in the room that felt like it belonged in the world I understood.

A new voice whispered from behind me, right at my shoulder.

“Wrong door.”

I spun around, heart in my throat.

The copy’s face hovered inches from mine, impossibly close without making a sound. Its eyes widened too far, like a mask stretching over the wrong skull.

“317,” it breathed. “Now.”

“I’m not going in there,” I whispered.

“You already have,” it said.

The doorframe exploded inward.

A hand — Mark’s hand — shot through the splintered wood, fingers clawing blindly for me. But as the fingers groped through the dust, something was wrong.

Too many knuckles.
The joints bent backward.
The nails were too long.

Mark’s voice growled from the other side, deeper than any human voice.

“YOU CAN’T STOP THIS.”

The copy yanked me backward before the hand could grab my shirt.

My spine hit the floor hard, pain spiking through me.

“MOVE,” the copy snarled.

“What are you—""

It didn’t answer.

It didn’t have to.

Because the moment I scrambled upright, the computer monitor glitched — and a new log entry appeared in bright, blinking red:

UNIT 317 — EXIT SCHEDULED
2:17 → 2:28

My breath stuttered.

Exit.

Not entry.

The logs for the past year…
They weren’t tracking someone going into Unit 317.

They were tracking someone — or something — coming out.

Every night.

For eleven minutes.

The pounding at the office door suddenly stopped.

Silence swallowed everything.

My ears rang.

The copy grabbed my wrist and pulled me toward the hallway. Its skin felt wrong. Cold. Hollow. Like touching a mannequin pretending to be warm.

“Why are you helping me?” I gasped.

Its lips twitched.

“I’m not helping you.”

The hallway lights clicked on in a perfect ripple — one fixture at a time — leading down the row of storage units like runway lights.

A path.

Toward Unit 317.

The one door in the facility glowing under a flickering fluorescent strobe.

2:21 AM.

Seven minutes left.


---

The wind outside howled between the metal rows, carrying dust and the metallic smell of old concrete. My breath came out in white bursts as I approached the unit.

The copy walked beside me.

Matching my pace.

Matching my breathing.

Matching my fear.

“Why did it pick me?” I whispered.

The copy smiled — that too-wide, too-empty smile.

“Because you listened.”

“To what?”

“To him.”

I swallowed. “The previous owner?”

“Owner…” the thing laughed softly. “Is that what you think he was?”

The alarm on Unit 317 flashed silently. No siren this time — just a pulsing red glow around the handle, like a heartbeat under metal.

The door trembled.

The copy leaned close.

“You need to understand something before he comes through.”

“Understand what?” I whispered.

Its head jerked at an unnatural angle.

“No matter what you’ve been told… He never stored anything in that unit.”
A step closer.
Cold air pressed against my neck.

“He was stored.”

My hand went numb around the flashlight.

“He’s the one that was locked in there for eleven minutes a night so the world wouldn’t shake apart.”

The metal roll-up door banged from the inside, loud enough to rattle my bones.

BANG.

The copy didn’t flinch.

I did.

“Why let him out now?” I whispered.

“You opened the pattern,” the copy said matter-of-factly. “You went to the door. You listened. You acknowledged him. You let him know you can hear.”

The metal door convulsed again.

BANG. BANG. BANG.

6 minutes left.

“He’s coming,” the copy whispered.

“What happens when he gets out fully?”

The smile vanished.

“You take his place.”

My pulse skidded.

“No. No, no, no—""

“That’s how the reset works,” the copy hissed. “One guard inside for eleven minutes. One guard outside to witness. Every night. Year after year. Until someone like you volunteers without knowing it.”

“I never volunteered,” I rasped.

“You did,” it said softly. “At 2:17 on your first week when you walked toward the door.”

The unit shuddered again.

BANG.

This time, it was weaker.

Not from lack of force.

From proximity.

He was right behind it.

2:24 AM.
Four minutes.

Wind ripped through the corridor, lifting dust in spirals. Every unit door clanged like something enormous was moving underground.

The copy stepped closer, its voice flattening.

“When this door opens, you’ll see him. Don’t run. Don’t scream. Don’t speak. Just step inside. For eleven minutes.”

“I’m not going in,” I whispered.

The copy paused.

Then its expression twisted into something startling.

Fear.

Real fear.

“If you don’t… he’ll replace you. Out here. With your face. Your voice. Your shift. Your life.”

Cold tore through my chest.

That was the moment I understood:

The copy wasn’t trying to replace me.
It was trying to warn me.

2:25 AM.

The door lock snapped.

A sharp, metallic shriek.

A voice — low, layered, impossibly ancient — rolled beneath the metal:

“TIME.”

The copy shoved me backward.

“Don’t let him choose for you! Step inside or he’ll become you forever!”

The door curled upward—

An inch.
Two inches.

Cold, black air poured out.

My reflection crawled across the metal like a ripple.

The voice again:

“TWELVE MINUTES.”

The copy shook me.

“GO!”

I forced myself toward the opening—

But something grabbed my ankle.

Mark’s voice screamed behind me:

“DON’T DO IT. THAT’S NOT HOW YOU STOP HIM!”

I turned—

Mark stood at the end of the row.
Or what was left of Mark.

Stretched face.
Black eyes.
Limbs wrong.

He pointed at the copy.

“THAT’S THE IMPOSTER! NOT HIM!”

The copy shrieked — a sound like tearing metal — and lunged at me.

I stumbled back, falling against the concrete as both versions of the truth loomed over me:

One saying step inside.
One saying run.

The door rolled up fully.

Darkness spilled out.

A hand — thin, gray, too long — reached outward.

My name tore through the air in that layered, impossible voice.

“CHOOSE.”

I looked at the two figures.

Then at the open unit.

Then at the clock.

2:28 AM.

Zero minutes left.

I made my choice.

And the world snapped sideways.


---

I woke on the floor of the office.

Alarm blaring.

Lights strobing.

A new log entry blinking on the monitor:

UNIT 317 — ENTRY
USER: [REDACTED]
DURATION: 00:11:00

Cold sweat dripped down my spine.

Then I saw the reflection in the monitor screen.

Not mine.

Too wide a smile.
Too still.
Too patient.

A voice — my voice, but not mine — whispered behind me:

You didn’t try, you didn’t listen, you didn’t try to listen. 
To you, the world was all perfect sunshine’s and rainbows. That’s what I liked about you. But, I don’t know, I just thought that somehow you’d be able to come down to earth for just a bit and…understand me.

You’re just…too good for me. 
That’s not a bad thing. There’s nothing for you to heal from. But, being around damaged goods remind them that they’re damaged in comparison, and that makes it hard to move on from. 
I tried telling you before. Before you ever asked me if I wanted to get coffee or catch a movie, that there was someone else. Someone I’d never see again. Someone I’d never talk to again.

Finally looking at making a switch from my tired old keurig! I have no experience when it comes to espresso, but I certainly love to drink it when I’m out! I’d like to try making my own and cut down on purchases and pod waste. I’m trying to pick between a few options, my budget range is around $200-300.  

I’ve looked at both the Bambino and De‘Longli Dedica Duo, but wasn’t sure the differences. I also wasn’t sure how many additional things needed to be purchased, like a grinder etc, to start making coffee once you have the machine. I currently only own a frother. 

I’m willing to spend some time learning, but I also constantly mess up my moka pot so worried about buying a machine and not being able to do it well 😅. A friend recommended maybe looking at a Phillips Baristina as foolproof easy option when going out the door in the morning, but seen a lot of mixed reviews on that. I was also curious how long it takes everyone on average to make their coffee with a non automatic machine and whether that was a pain point. 

Hoping to get some recommendations here, thank you!",1,1765166484.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Would a Nespresso be better? [$300],"I get a latte from starbucks about a couple times a week, and at home will make a cup of black coffee using a Keurig once a day. (I don't use the K cups, I use ground beans in a filter cup). I don't have a refined palette so even the black cup of coffee from a Keurig has been fine for me.

But I've had thoughts about maybe trying to upgrade from the Keurig and trying to make lattes and espressos at home. I know almost nothing about making them, and I'm not very interested in getting too deep and complicated with this. I just want something that's easy to use, and doesn't require being an expert in espresso making.

My budget is only $300. So my questions are:

1. Which would be better to get Nespresso or espresso machine? I don't know much about the different between them
2. Are the machines under $300 worth it? Can they make decent espressos and lattes with minimal effort and expertise? If so do you have any recommendations? (I'm U.S based).",1,1765166315.0,espresso,6,0.67,False

He is sick today and stayed home from work, he asked me to go on his phone and put up his shift for tomorrow to see if someone would pick it up, he fell asleep after he asked me to and I naturally went through his phone as he has always told me I could do because he said he “has nothing to hide” and wants to do whatever he can for me to feel secure. 

I found no messages of him cheating but instead I found messages of him with chat gpt basically saying how he feels like I add no value in his life and his life was easier without me in it, that he feels like he does all of the cooking and that I made him a steak once and it was “Awful, disgusting and raw”, that I treat him like a therapist with my concerns about my child and my estranged relationship with her father, he said “I know if I end things with her I will miss her which is only natural since I’m just so used to having her around”, that i basically live with him and don’t contribute to any bills or anything financially, feeling concerned if he stayed in the relationship is it bc he truly cares or is just attached to me. 

He mentioned good things about me were “she does wake up before me and sometimes make me coffee” “she’s not all bad and I do care about her”. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with this information. I also had sent him a long heart felt message apologizing about a argument we had and he copy and pasted the whole message into chat gpt and asked how to respond then basically copy and pasted the response to me.

I don’t know what to do. Our relationship in my eyes has been perfect, he treats me great and after getting out of a DV relationship I feel like I found my soulmate so this is incredibly jarring for me. I also want to add he isn’t wrong that I do basically live with him however it was his idea for this to even happen and when we discussed it he told me he doesn’t want me to pay any bills all he wants is for me to have a safe place to stay. I do cook for him and I vividly remember the night I cooked the steak and it wasn’t cooked enough and I profusely apologized about it to which he responded by telling me it was no big deal to relax and just put it back on the pan.

1ph2l2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1ph2l2t/19_sciencebased_flirting_tricks_that_actually/,19 science-based flirting tricks that actually build chemistry (according to Matthew Hussey),"Everyone loves to talk about flirting, but barely anyone knows how to actually do it right. Most of us were taught by watching teen rom-coms, picking up crumbs from TikTok “coaches” who give cringe advice like “mirror their body language” or “ask them their star sign then pull away mysteriously.” No thanks.

In real life, flirting isn’t a mysterious art. It’s science + social skills + timing. I’ve spent years researching this ,  not just reading studies but listening to relationship psychology podcasts, going through lectures by actual experts, and yes, binge-watching Matthew Hussey. He’s one of the few dating coaches who doesn’t yell at you, doesn’t play manipulative games, and still somehow makes flirting feel fun and respectful.

So many of us are stuck in “texting limbo” with people we’re lightly interested in, afraid to push it forward because we don’t want to seem “thirsty.” Or we go on dates that are... fine. Maybe even nice. But chemistry just doesn’t happen. 

Here’s what most people don’t realize: chemistry is often created, not just felt. And yeah, a lot of those flirting tricks you think are cringe? Actually work, when you do them right.

These 19 flirting cues aren’t just from Matthew Hussey ,  they’re backed by research from top social psychologists and attraction studies. Let’s get into it.

- **Add playful contrast to your compliments**  
  Instead of bland “You look great,” try “You clean up well... I almost didn’t recognize you.” Hussey calls this “teasing within safety” ,  the contrast creates flirtation. Research from the University of Kansas confirms that playful teasing increases romantic interest when there's already rapport.

- **Be a little mysterious in your reply timing**  
  Don’t ghost. But also, don’t be instantly available 24/7. Delay your replies just enough to create suspense. According to attachment theory research from Amir Levine (author of Attached), unpredictability in early texting builds desire ,  not because of game-playing, but because it activates emotional anticipation.

- **Ask spicy questions, not generic ones**  
  Instead of “What do you do?” ask “What’s something you do when no one’s watching?” or “If your ex had to say your most annoying trait, what would they pick?” These types of questions increase intimacy by skipping small talk ,  a framework based on the “36 Questions to Fall in Love” study by Arthur Aron.

- **Own your attraction, don’t hide it**  
  Hussey always says that flirtation works when there’s a balance of directness and detachment. You can say, “You’re dangerously attractive. I should probably stay away,” then smile and shift topics. You’re signaling interest without being needy ,  big win.

- **Use eye contact a little longer than comfortable**  
  Let your gaze linger for one extra second. That’s it. A 2006 study published in Psychological Science found that eye contact held for more than 2–3 seconds increases feelings of connection significantly. But don’t overdo it or you’ll look possessed.

- **Initiate light physical contact (but read the room)**  
  A quick touch on the arm when laughing. A playful nudge. These create a sense of closeness and familiarity. A study from University of Mississippi found that light touches during conversation increased tip likelihood by 40 percent. It works the same way in dating.

- **Use inside jokes early**  
  Matthew Hussey teaches this often: once you create a shared joke, call it back later. That “we get each other” moment bonds people faster than deep conversations. It’s your own private world.

- **Switch environments during the date**  
  Go from coffee to a bookstore, or take a walk after dinner. Shifting locations increases perceived intimacy, according to research from Northwestern University. It simulates progression and makes it feel like the relationship is evolving.

- **End the date first**  
  If there’s chemistry, leave a little early. Say “I have to run, but this was fun.” This creates a sense of momentum. Leaving first (not rudely) builds desire better than dragging the date into awkward overtime.

- **Don’t fish for compliments ,  give them with intent**  
  Instead of waiting to be told you’re attractive, tell them what draws you in about them ,  their confidence, their laugh, the way they talk with their hands. As per research in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, authentic compliments build trust faster than flattery.

- **Mirror energy not behavior**  
  Matching someone’s exact gestures feels robotic. But matching their vibe ,  fast talker vs. more slow-paced thinker ,  makes them subconsciously feel “we’re the same.” This is backed by NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) principles, though you don’t need to study it to do this.

- **Talk about near-miss romantic stories**  
  Sharing silly dating fails, or people you almost dated, creates vulnerability plus subtle flexing. It shows you’re wanted, without bragging. Studies from Dr. Helen Fisher show that light storytelling increases dopamine, the neurochemical behind desire.

- **Text with curiosity, not check-ins**  
  Say: “Ok wait, I need to know your most controversial opinion…” instead of “Hey, how was your day?” Keep things emotionally open-ended, not just task-oriented. This boosts emotional intrigue.

- **Practice “delayed reward” flirtation**  
  Tease something fun ,  “I have a story that’ll make you judge me…” ,  but say you'll tell them later. That wait time builds suspense. Based on B.F. Skinner’s reward schedule theory, delaying gratification increases value.

- **Use disqualifiers to increase attraction**  
  Say: “I don’t usually go for people like you, but…” It makes you seem selective. A 2013 study from Stanford found selective disinterest signals high social status and increases attraction.

- **Use voice memos or videos, not just text**  
  Hearing your voice adds warmth and expresses tone better. From the Gottman Institute’s relationship lab, they found vocal tone communicates more emotional context than written words.

- **Use the “third-party compliment” trick**  
  Tell them something flattering you told a friend about them. Example: “I told my roommate you have the best laugh I've heard in a while.” People perceive compliments as more genuine when relayed indirectly ,  researched by Dr. Vanessa Bohns of Cornell.

- **Suggest future plans early, without pressure**  
  “You seem like someone who’d be fun at an escape room.” This creates a script for future hangouts without asking directly. It’s what Hussey calls “planting seeds” ,  casual but directional.

- **Don’t ask for reassurance ,  stay playful**  
  Instead of saying “Did you have fun?” Just say “I’ll let you pretend this wasn’t the best date of your week.” Flirt, don’t seek validation.

Some of the best resources to level this up:

- **Book: Get the Guy by Matthew Hussey**  
  This New York Times bestseller isn’t just about “getting a guy.” It’s about confidence, emotional connection, and breaking old patterns. Matthew mixes practical tools with psychology. One of the best books I’ve read on non-cringey, authentic dating.

- **Podcast: Love Life with Matthew Hussey**  
  Easily digestible episodes where Hussey breaks down real dating dilemmas with actual scripts you can use. He doesn’t sound preachy, and the episodes are short and super actionable.

- **Book: Models by Mark Manson**  
  Subtitled “Attract Women Through Honesty,” but really it’s about becoming a better communicator. Manson’s brutal honesty and emotional intelligence make this one of the best books for anyone who wants to flirt with confidence. Insanely good read.

- **App: Ash**  
  Built for modern relationship growth. Helps you track emotions, needs, and communication styles across dating stages. Seriously underrated ,  feels like a pocket therapist and dating coach in one.

- **App: BeFreed**  
  An AI-powered learning app built by Columbia and ex-Google minds. It turns top expert books and research into personalized audio podcasts and adaptive learning plans based on your self-growth goals. You can ask it to help you improve your dating mindset or confidence, and it’ll craft a podcast just for you ,  in your chosen voice, with the exact depth you want. The learning plan evolves with you. Perfect for lifelong learners who want to grow without doomscrolling.

- **YouTube Channel: The School of Life (Alain de Botton)**  
  Philosophical but relatable takes on modern love, vulnerability, and emotional intimacy. Their videos like “Why You Will Marry the Wrong Person” are viral for a reason. Makes you rethink how attraction actually works.

- **App: Finch**  
  Not a dating app. It’s for self-care, mood tracking, and habit-building. But if you want to flirt better, it helps to feel grounded and confident in yourself. Finch is low pressure and cute without being cringe.

Once you understand these small cues and craft, flirting becomes less about “performing” and more about creating tension, joy, mystery, and moments. Chemistry isn't magic. It’s built.",4,1765166249.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

He is sick today and stayed home from work, he asked me to go on his phone and put up his shift for tomorrow to see if someone would pick it up, he fell asleep after he asked me to and I naturally went through his phone as he has always told me I could do because he said he “has nothing to hide” and wants to do whatever he can for me to feel secure. 

I found no messages of him cheating but instead I found messages of him with chat gpt basically saying how he feels like I add no value in his life and his life was easier without me in it, that he feels like he does all of the cooking and that I made him a steak once and it was “Awful, disgusting and raw”, that I treat him like a therapist with my concerns about my child and my estranged relationship with her father, he said “I know if I end things with her I will miss her which is only natural since I’m just so used to having her around”, that i basically live with him and don’t contribute to any bills or anything financially, feeling concerned if he stayed in the relationship is it bc he truly cares or is just attached to me. 

He mentioned good things about me were “she does wake up before me and sometimes make me coffee” “she’s not all bad and I do care about her”. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with this information. I also had sent him a long heart felt message apologizing about a argument we had and he copy and pasted the whole message into chat gpt and asked how to respond then basically copy and pasted the response to me.

I don’t know what to do. Our relationship in my eyes has been perfect, he treats me great and after getting out of a DV relationship I feel like I found my soulmate so this is incredibly jarring for me. I also want to add he isn’t wrong that I do basically live with him however it was his idea for this to even happen and when we discussed it he told me he doesn’t want me to pay any bills all he wants is for me to have a safe place to stay. I do cook for him and I vividly remember the night I cooked the steak and it wasn’t cooked enough and I profusely apologized about it to which he responded by telling me it was no big deal to relax and just put it back on the pan. Should I bring this up to him? Should I act like I never saw it?

1ph20zj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ph20zj/it_drips_on_my_head_when_i_cant_move/,It drips on my head when I can’t move,"It starts with the smell. Not a smell of rot, or blood, or anything you’d expect. It’s the smell of ozone, like the air after a lightning strike, mixed with the damp, mineral scent of a deep cave. That’s how I know I’m slipping into the prison. That’s how I know the gallery is open.

My name is Layla. For three years, I’ve been a student of the ceiling. I know every crack in the plaster above my bed, every subtle shift of shadow from the distant streetlamp outside my window. I’ve traced constellations in the imperfections, named them: The cleft, the stain, the fissure. Astronomy of the inert. It’s my only defense when the paralysis sets in.

It’s textbook, they said. Stress. A glitch in the REM cycle. Your brain wakes up before your body. The sensation of a presence? A common hallucination. The crushing weight on your chest? Your own dormant diaphragm. It’s all in your mind, Layla. So comforting. So utterly, catastrophically wrong.

The process is a familiar betrayal. First, the ozone cave smell, seeping into the room like a gas. Then, the low hum, a frequency that seems to vibrate in my teeth rather than my ears. My body becomes a tomb, a beautiful, intricate statue of flesh and bone I can no longer command. I am a mind in a marble casing. And then… the understanding that I am not alone in the gallery.

It stands just outside my field of vision, always in the periphery, a clot of deeper darkness in the already dark room. I can’t turn my head to see it. The gallery’s rules are strict. I can only stare at my ceiling constellations and feel it approach. The temperature drops. Not a chill, but an absence of warmth, as if it’s drawing the energy from the air itself. And I would hear the breathing. Not mine. This was a wet, rhythmic sound, a slow inhalation that ended in a faint, bubbling gurgle. It was the sound of something with inefficient lungs, something that wasn’t built for this air.

Then comes the wetness.

A single, cold drop. It lands on my temple, just at the hairline, and slides with agonizing slowness down into my hair. Another. And another. A slow, cold leak from a reality above mine. It’s viscous. It doesn’t evaporate. When I finally burst free from the stone of my body, gasping, my heart a trapped bird slamming against my ribs, my hair is always damp in that one spot. Cold, sticky, smelling of ozone and cave.

I scrambled to the bathroom. In the harsh light, my face was pale, my eyes wild. And there, on my skin, gleaming, were two tacky, amber flecked droplets. They smelled of decay and metal. 

I told my therapist about the wet hair. A sympathetic smile. “Post episode perspiration, Layla. It can feel localized, strange. The brain is a tricky place.” But brains don’t leave residue. Brains don’t leave a smell that lingers on your pillow until you wash the case.

The horror wasn’t just the paralysis, or the presence. It was the mundane, puzzling evidence of it. The dampness. It was a proof my rational mind couldn’t logic away. I started sleeping with a towel on the pillow. I’d wake up, and the towel would be dry, but my hair, underneath, would be wet. As if the wetness passed through solid matter. As if it was meant for me, specifically.

The fear curdled into a desperate, furious curiosity. I was being studied in my own private gallery, drip fed terror. I needed to see the artist.

I bought a small, infrared security camera. I positioned it on my bookshelf, pointed directly at the bed. A digital eye to witness what my mortal ones could not. I set it to record on motion detection. That night, as the ozone smell began to bleed into the room, I felt a new emotion alongside the dread: a grim sense of vindication. Tonight, I would have answers. Or I would finally have proof of my own insanity. Either was preferable to the not knowing.

The episode was the same. The hum, the stone, the crushing isolation, the drops: cold, deliberate, marking me. The presence felt… heavier. Closer. There was a new sound, a soft, fibrous creak, like old leather being stretched. I could feel the cold seep through my t-shirt. I lay there, a frozen banquet, weeping inside as the thing above me feasted with its eyes.Then it was over. I swam up from the cement of sleep, drenched in sweat and that other, colder dampness. I didn’t even move to turn on the light. I just reached for my laptop, connected to the camera, and pulled up the night’s file.

The video was there. Three hours of stillness, then a burst of activity at 3:17 AM. My sleeping form, a pale mound under the blankets. The timestamp ticked forward in the eerie green and black of night vision.

At 3:18, something entered the frame from the top.

It didn’t walk. It unfolded. It was all wrong angles and impossible, elongated segments, like a puppet made of shadows and broken furniture, controlled by a careless child. It was tall, so tall its upper body was lost in the darkness above the camera’s view. But the lower part… it had too many joints, bending in directions that spoke of a biology not of this earth. It moved with a stuttering, stop motion grace.

Then it leaned down.

The camera caught its face. Or the terrible approximation of one.

It was long and narrow, a grotesque, stretched teardrop of a head. Its skin was the color and texture of a dried mushroom, puckered and matte. It had no eyes that I could see, just smooth, shallow depressions. But its mouth… a lipless, horizontal slit that ran halfway down the length of its face. And it was slack, slightly open. It moved to the bedside, its gait a series of jerky, insectile adjustments. It leaned over me, its form blocking the light. And then, from the darkness of that slit, a long, black, rope like tongue slithered out. It wasn’t a tongue for tasting. It was a conduit. At its tip, a bead of that thick, iridescent fluid gathered and fell. Drip. 

Right onto my temple.

I watched, frozen, as my paralyzed self lay motionless. The creature didn’t move. It simply… loomed. And drooled. The string of saliva was constant, a glistening thread in the infrared connecting its jaw to my hair. For ten minutes, it just stood there, leaking onto me.

Then, the fibrous creak I’d heard. On the screen, the horizontal slit of its mouth twitched. The lower part of its jaw, a separate bone from the rest of its skull, detached slightly. It dropped a fraction of an inch, widening the opening of its maw. It wasn’t a dramatic movement. It was subtle. Deliberate. Like it was testing its own hinges.

Then it straightened, folding back up into the darkness above the frame, leaving only the timestamp and my sleeping, soiled body.

I vomited. I vomited until I was hollow. The proof was not liberating. It was a death sentence. This was no hallucination. It was a thing. A real, physical thing that came into my room, stood over me, and… fed? Watched? Prepared?

The metaphor wasn’t lost on me. Isn’t that what chronic fear is? A slow drip of dread that soaks into the fabric of who you are? A presence that feeds on your helplessness, widening its maw a little more each night, waiting until your spirit is soft enough to swallow whole? My monster was just a literalization of the paralysis itself, the creeping, consuming helplessness.

But metaphors don’t leave sticky residue. Metaphors don’t appear on infrared cameras.

I was a ghost in the daytime, hollowed out by the nightly terror. I stopped sleeping, drinking coffee until my hands shook, but it didn’t matter. I became a strategist of insomnia. I avoided the bed, the gallery, for two nights. On the third, exhaustion dragged me down like stones in a pocket. The smell greeted me before I even lost consciousness. Ozone. Cave. Home, it seemed to say. The paralysis came again, a forced consciousness, a front row seat to my own consumption.

This time was different. The paralysis was heavier, the hum deeper, resonating in my bones. The drops came faster, not a drip but a trickle, as if it was excited I’d returned. And the creak… it was louder. Longer. I could feel the air displace above me, could sense the widening of that awful, unhinging jaw. It was closer. It was hungrier. It could fit me now.

It paused there, for an eternity, that abyss yawning over me. I stared up into it. And in that moment, past the terror, I felt something else…a profound, cosmic understanding. This wasn’t a random monster. It was an eater of stillness. A consumer of trapped souls. My paralysis wasn’t a cage keeping me from escaping it; it was the sauce that made me palatable. My fear was the seasoning. It didn’t eat me. It closed its jaw, slowly, the bones crunching back into their mockery of a face, and retreated.

I broke free with a scream already tearing from my throat. The wetness wasn’t just in my hair; it was on my cheek, my neck. I fled the room, spent the night shivering in my bathtub.

Last night, I tried the camera again. A final document. A last will and testament of my sanity.

The video showed the now familiar unfolding, the hovering. But this time, it didn’t just stand. It lowered its entire upper body, bringing its face inches from mine. The slack mouth, that dripping slit, filled the screen. And as I watched, paralyzed on tape, the lower jaw unhinged with a sickening, sustained crackle. It dropped down, down, revealing a gullet of impenetrable blackness. The mouth was now a yawning chasm, wide enough to fit over my entire head. It held that position, a living, breathing mouth hole, poised over my face. The drool wasn’t a drip now; it was a rivulet, pouring over my forehead and hair.

It stayed like that for the entire episode. Not feeding. Not yet. Just… measuring. Practicing.

The episode ended. On screen, I gasped and stirred. And the creature… it didn’t jerk away. It didn’t flee. It slowly, so slowly, closed its jaw. The hinge lifted with that same leathery creak. Then it turned its smooth, eyeless face.

It turned toward the camera.

It tilted its head, as if noticing the little red eye for the first time. As if it knew I’d been watching. As if it knew I knew.

It didn’t unfold away. It simply…faded, dissolving into the shadows not as something leaving, but as something retreating into a layer of reality just behind my own.

I’m writing this now at 4 PM, sitting in a sunbeam. The world is bright and normal. But I can still smell the cave. The damp spot in my hair from last night never quite dried. It’s cold, and it smells like my future. I am not safe. The light means nothing. It’s in my house. It’s in the negative space behind my eyelids. I can feel it waiting in the walls, in the quiet hum of appliances, in the very air I breathe.

I know what it wants. It’s done tasting. It’s done practicing.

Tonight, when the paralysis pins me, and the shadow unfolds, and the dripping starts… it won’t stop at dripping. The jaw will unhinge, wider than ever before, and it will keep going. And I will lie there, my silent screams the final garnish, as it finally consumes the feast it has been patiently preparing.

And yet another part of me knows, it’s not waiting for the paralysis anymore. That was just the training wheels. It was using the paralysis as a conduit, a door. Now the door is wedged open. It knows I see it. The rules have changed.

Sleep always wins. Eventually, the body betrays the mind. Eventually, I will go back to the gallery. And when I do, I don’t think I’ll be paralyzed. I think I’ll be awake. I think I’ll be able to move. I’ll be able to scream.

And I think its jaw is now wide enough to fit.",1,1765164553.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1ph20ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMagnusArchives/comments/1ph20ig/magnus_rpg/,Magnus RPG,"I posted here a while ago about a fantastic present my boyfriend gave me, which included a treasure hunt and a copy of the players' guide for the Magnus Archives Role-Playing Game. I was able to get a group gathered, thanks to this sub, and we are about to do our 4th session. I created a homebrew world based on some fun facts that I stumbled across about Olympia Fields, Illinois. While everything in our campaign is fictional, I drew inspiration from the way the town looks, some landmarks, and the local governance system, and, of course, from the Magnus archives and Magnus Protocol podcasts.  

The campaign centers on the Jonah Magnus Library, a central pillar of the community. This building comprises a central tower (3 floors open to the public) and two wings (2 floors each); the bottom floor of each wing is a covered patio.  
it was built in the 1940's and has burned down twice but somehow always manages to ""spring back up"" its open from 9 am- 8 pm M-F and Saturday 9:30 am-2 pm, and houses approximately 20 staff, run by a very bright and bubbly librarian by the name of Rosalie Crane.  The security team is comprised of 4 members, as for some reason, due to its historic location, it is often the target of B&E's, fires, and vandalism.

 This is the most extensive public library in the southern half of the state and has a cafe, two covered outdoor patios, one specifically for children, a public container garden, and another reserved for quiet.  The library also houses a state of the art computer lab/lounge complete with a VR set up, as well as huge literary collection complete with approximately 45,000 different volumes (fiction-all types- philosophy, religion, social science, language, history, science- including a specific section for manuscripts and thesis- technical books, young adult novels- including those that might be needed for school curricula- classical literature, financial, arts, references, computer science, cook books/ cuisine and a HUGE kids section) in several languages including braille, about 50 years worth of magazines and periodicals, and thousands of movies, books on tape and music collections including records, cassettes, and CDs- there is a sound room on the third floor, for people to listen, people can also rent equipment (record, cassette & CD players, VCR and CD players. and laptops).  Community members often visit at least once a week, grab a coffee/tea/snack at the cafe, socialize, or pick up a book and sit either on the patio or inside.  There are often TONS of children (toddler-teens) reading/playing/socializing.  Many community members often tend to and teach about the container garden. Local artists can set up in the Wing One Patio area on Saturdays to display/sell their artwork. 

We have a lovely cast of player characters: 

Mara Vexly- A pretentious Occultist who solves mysteries.  

Eva Moon- A smart Occultist who fights dirty. 

Jack Flemming- a ruthless Protector who leads.  

Vivian Park- A likeable elocutionist who works back alleys. 

Jason Walts- a quick investigator who explores dark places.  

In session 1: Vivian started a new job at the library. She was introduced to Eva (owner of the Moons, Myths, and Magic occult shop) and her employee, Mara, who were visiting the library to retrieve a special-order book.  Jason, who was lurking upstairs, was distraught when Rosalie borrowed his court docket (this is still a running joke). And Jack, head of security, was hurriedly running about the place completing tasks and ""keeping an eye"" on a set of triplets who gave him ""weird vibes"" (another running joke- Jack doesn't believe in triplets)

Session 2: Eva and Mara were offered a sale of an odd collection of old medical tools from a repeat customer (Macy). They found her too suspicious and refused the sale. After a veiled threat and loose threads of information, the pair decided to break into the library later that evening.  Viv, in her primary role of 'computer room supervisor,' stumbled across a startling collection of internet searches, including ""how to quit a job,"" ""can you feel when someone's looking at you,"" ""don't look away, she hates that,"" among others.  Jason, continuing his investigation into a car crash, attempts to interrogate Viv about her involvement. Jack, on the lookout for ""suspicious people,"" helped a lost child, an elderly man with the slow elevator, and handled a suspicious bag.  He then stumbled across some static-filled video footage of the triplets from the day before.  Chasing them back into the elevator they introduced themselves as the Mortlock triplets and begged Jack not to tell Rosalie about the, ""'comin up too early."" after a 4 hour seemingly endless elevator ride, Jack, now overwhelmed with claustrophobia pried himself out of the elevator, stumbling into Jason and Viv, and the sneaky pair from Moons, Myths and Magics (who had just ran inside after a suspicious voicemail-with no prior call- from Jack) Rosalie met the group and her ""associate,"" Cassity, and an outburst of questions prompted a meeting the next morning. 

Session 3: The group started on the library porch, Jason hastily questioning Viv. Eva guided the group back to her shop to continue talking a little more civilized.  Tea was made, a mothman statue was provided for comfort, and hypotheses about their current situation began to fly. The group rested, and the next morning, met with a very dismissive Rosalie bright and early.    Most got frustrated and stormed off.  Mara had a more-than-heart-to-heart with Rosalie.  Eva and Viv stumbled across Cassity ""the associate,"" who promised that all their questions would be answered if they went to the address provided on a ratty, curled business card and ran her a little errand. Jack and Jason went to the security room to review more footage from the night before, and were later joined by a shaken Mara. The group planned to meet after Jack and Vivian's shift. The session ended with Jack deciding to ditch work and go on this side quest with Eva and Mara before their evening meeting. 

Session 4: Started with a party split- Eva, Mara, and Jack(who skipped his shift at the library) found their way over to the address on the business card, a nice little apartment belonging to Macy. Soon, it became a combat zone as Eva attempted to steal the roll of tools quickly. Macy had become almost unrecognizable, bearing three faces and six arms, gently playing her pipe of scrimshawed bone, fought, and was severely injured by the trio.  Eventually, getting them to listen to her, they made the sale of tools and took them back to the library.  Viv and Jason had a regular enough morning, Jason added a new case to his docket, and Viv reminded the kids not to get anything sticky on the computers.  Their afternoon, however, was much weirder. Viv was again confronted with a creepy message on the computer screen, and both were led to an old case involving the disappearances of several people in the area about 30 years earlier.  The papers and facts seemed fairly misleading, and some were contradictory.  They were ""helped"" along by a gentleman by the name of Caleb Mercer, who led them to a misfiled statement belonging to Rosalie Crane, the librarian, who had described when and why she had become so very fearful of holes.  A very late-night confrontation at the library ended with Jack being suspended without pay for 3 weeks, and the whole group being very hurriedly asked to leave the premises.  The night ended with the group returning to the Magic shop, curling up with blankets and pillows in the staff lounge, drinking their tea (and whiskey), and trying to sort out the day's events.  They were woken by Cassity, who had a small job for Viv, telling her that it would earn her a full day off, with pay, all she had to do was drop off some gloves at Rosalie's office.  The session ended with Eva, Mara, and Viv returning to the shop and finding an Ace of Swords tarot card that had been placed in their door. At the same time, Jason and Jack argued about nothing in particular. 

Here's to many more sessions! I'd love to hear from any other DMs who are running this tabletop and how you are weaving your stories.  ",7,1765164509.0,TheMagnusArchives,3,1.0,False

He is sick today and stayed home from work, he asked me to go on his phone and put up his shift for tomorrow to see if someone would pick it up, he fell asleep after he asked me to and I naturally went through his phone as he has always told me I could do because he said he “has nothing to hide” and wants to do whatever he can for me to feel secure. 

I found no messages of him cheating but instead I found messages of him with chat gpt basically saying how he feels like I add no value in his life and his life was easier without me in it, that he feels like he does all of the cooking and that I made him a steak once and it was “Awful, disgusting and raw”, that I treat him like a therapist with my concerns about my child and my estranged relationship with her father, he said “I know if I end things with her I will miss her which is only natural since I’m just so used to having her around”, that i basically live with him and don’t contribute to any bills or anything financially, feeling concerned if he stayed in the relationship is it bc he truly cares or is just attached to me. 

He mentioned good things about me were “she does wake up before me and sometimes make me coffee” “she’s not all bad and I do care about her”. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with this information. I also had sent him a long heart felt message apologizing about a argument we had and he copy and pasted the whole message into chat gpt and asked how to respond then basically copy and pasted the response to me.

I don’t know what to do. Our relationship in my eyes has been perfect, he treats me great and after getting out of a DV relationship I feel like I found my soulmate so this is incredibly jarring for me. I also want to add he isn’t wrong that I do basically live with him however it was his idea for this to even happen and when we discussed it he told me he doesn’t want me to pay any bills all he wants is for me to have a safe place to stay. I do cook for him and I vividly remember the night I cooked the steak and it wasn’t cooked enough and I profusely apologized about it to which he responded by telling me it was no big deal to relax and just put it back on the pan.

I need advice on how to heal and move forward.,"Before we ever got involved, he had been with a girl in 1st year. She was decent and wanted marriage; he filled that time with “young and free” behaviour, gave her hope but never actually committed. He had two friends — one of those friends was involved in drinking with a girl at a concert and trying to take her to an Airbnb.

Fast forward to 2nd year: he started texting me at the start of the year. I didn’t know the dynamics between him and that other girl. I only knew he hadn’t been roaming around her for a while and they weren’t together, and I wasn’t initially interested, so I would reply to his texts. But he did everything to engage me — asked me to hang out with his friend group, updated me about his day, took me out for ice cream, invited me to libraries to study and then take chai/ice cream afterwards. This went on for about 4 months. I thought he might be serious. I ignored small red flags like him staring at my thighs, a first-time sexy compliment over text (“your lips are so sexy”), and his friend who made a girl drink.

He portrayed himself as honest — one time he told me he needed to “see a female family friend” because her AC didn’t work in her college dorm/hostel and she was scared, and I thought that was so honest of him and also nice of him . In June he gifted me books and took me to coffee during my exams.

In late August I finally said yes when he asked me out. But he often seemed lost in thought; when I asked, he’d say he was tired.

He emphasized staying in Airbnbs and hotels — “we should stay at a really good and vibey place.” That’s when things started to unravel.

I learned how his big brother invites girls to his apartment. He immediately started taking me to vibey places and buying expensive food. He spent most time with me, but I never felt good inside — something felt wrong.

He would play a girl’s playlist on Spotify. I noticed a girl was his #1 best friend on Snapchat. When I asked, he said she was a family friend — the same “family friend” excuse he used for many girls. Later I saw him texting her on iMessage; when I tried to open his phone he got defensive and deleted messages. He removed her, added her again, fought about it a hundred times, and finally removed her after many fights.

Then I saw him liking an entire girl’s Instagram feed — she was from our class. I asked him not to do it; he called her a “model” and I slapped him. He had wandering eyes — we went to a coffee place and he stared at a model until I called it out. He said I always ruin moods and want to fight. I think he went back to try to get her number.

We fought a lot because he’d randomly say he wanted to switch routines and add junior girls on social apps. He claimed he tried to fix issues by involving his friends and asking for their advice.

I cried all the time. One month before my proffs I asked the girl he’d been with last year about their dynamic. She told me he randomly dropped her for no reason and that was the exact time he started talking to me. She said he texted her on and off saying he missed her, then acted happy, tried to make her jealous by roaming with me, and sat around her in class to keep attachments. When me and him started dating, 3–4 months later he messaged her saying he missed her and didn’t want awkwardness — she told him she didn’t care and was with someone who treated her better. I broke down because I trusted him; she sent me proof of messages.

Back in April/May when we studied together, someone would text/call him repeatedly — I saw a notification from that same girl on his Apple Watch and he left saying “wait I’m coming” and came back. And fast forward to when I got into the RS, I would constantly call him and he wouldn’t just pick up the same way. 

During proffs, our relationship fell apart with trust issues. I checked his phone a lot. One time I found he’d added junior girls on his account. He added girls from quick add and lied saying they were his brother’s female friends. He also added a girl who once told him she liked him. I suspected he was interested in the new batch. I still stayed because of physical and emotional connection.

My grades tanked; he got perfect scores (I later found out he bought the exams). After exams we had vacations — he went to Lahore and disappeared for two days, going to lunches/dinners and not picking calls. I blocked him for 6 days. He texted everywhere saying he didn’t want to lose me, so we got back together.

3rd year began and his image in our batch got worse. I managed to get him into my clinical group. At first it felt like progress, but then he started staring at juniors in front of me, adding every junior, ignoring me in the clinical group, acting like he was single, and roaming with one girl while staring at her body in OT. He ignored me, called his behavior “professional,” denied everything, then tried to be intimate with me and called it fixing things.

This continued. I found his Twitter where he tweeted about loving Kylie Jenner and other disrespectful things. He told me he didn’t care anymore and acted cold and distant.

My mental health and self-esteem collapsed. I got angry and went violent because I felt violated. I screamed, yelled, went crazy, and came to his place via Uber to find answers.

He broke up with me. I tried to move on and hung out with new people. He saw a snap of me out and stood outside my hostel, acted violently, called me a slut in front of college, hit me, tried to snatch my phone, and accused me of cheating publicly. I was humiliated and the new guy left thinking I’d cheated. But most people took my side and isolated him.

In June he called, apologized, felt guilty, and said he wanted a fresh start. I listened and in July we started again.

When we restarted in July he hid our relationship publicly because he said I’d humiliated him. He hid me from friends and it didn’t feel right. In August I saw him liking the same girl’s LinkedIn post (the one who had been interested in him). He liked thousands of girls’ posts; he hid his likes and told me to “stop” when I confronted him.

I started getting crazy. He put in zero effort, never spent time  on the relationship, and blamed me for supposedly planning something against him. September–October were awful. Then in November he suddenly promised to take me out every weekend — he actually took me out twice before I had to go home to study. On November 20th I was with my clinical group; he called wanting to see me. When I went to see him he accused me of being with a guy. I was with my whole clinical group. I screamed and slammed things in his car for 30 minutes, blocked him, and grabbed his collar. He grabbed my hand and showed me his fist saying if a guy grabbed me he’d punch him. I left.

He texted he never wanted to see me again and was done for real this time. He suspected pregnancy for a while and waited for it maybe.

He blocked me everywhere, including the spam account. I blocked him too. He immediately added someone else on the spam account and his main followers increased. He went to a batchmate’s wedding, danced and made sure I watched the stories. I didn’t react, so he made another account and texted me calling me a slut, accusing me of being on Bumble (I never made a Bumble). I had my brother tell him to never text me again and I blocked him for good.

Now I’m shattered. My mental health is broken. I can’t study, can’t focus, I sleep all the time out of depression.",1,1765164298.0,relationships_advice,1,1.0,False

**काव्या:** नमस्ते नन्दिनि। अद्य तु भारतीयानां कृते गर्वस्य विषयः उपस्थापितः। महान्-गणितज्ञेन श्रीनिवास-रामानुजेन शतवर्ष-पूर्वम् एकं विशिष्टं गणित-सूत्रं रचितम्। तत् सूत्रं 'पै' (Pi) इति मानस्य विषयकम् अभूत्। सम्प्रति वैज्ञानिकैः ज्ञातं यत् तस्मिन् सूत्रे ब्रह्माण्डस्य गभीराणि रहस्यानि निगूढानि सन्ति। तेन सूत्रेण भौतिकशास्त्रस्य नूतन-सिद्धान्ताः अपि स्पष्टीकृताः।  
**Kavya:** Hello, Nandini. Today we present a matter of pride for all Indians. A century ago, the great mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan created a unique mathematical formula related to the constant “Pi.” Scientists have now discovered that this formula conceals deep secrets of the universe. It has also helped explain new principles of physics.  

**नन्दिनी:** सत्यम्। सः उत्कृष्ट-गणितज्ञः अस्माकं गौरवम् अभूत्। इदानीं गगन-विषये का अन्या वार्ता?  
**Nandini:** True. That extraordinary mathematician was our pride. Now, what other piece of news is there about space?  

**काव्या:** खगोल-शास्त्रिभिः अस्माकं मन्दाकिन्याः एका 'यमला' दृष्टा। सा ब्रह्माण्डस्य उत्पत्तेः अनन्तरं शीघ्रम् एव निर्मिता। एतावत् पूर्वं, सुव्यवस्थिता मन्दाकिनी कथं जाता, इति विचिन्त्य वैज्ञानिकाः चकिताः अभूवन्।  
**Kavya:** Astronomers have discovered a “twin” of our Milky Way galaxy. It was formed shortly after the birth of the universe. Scientists are amazed at how such an organized galaxy could have developed so early.  

**नन्दिनी:** विचित्रा खलु सृष्टिः। ते वैज्ञानिकाः सत्यम् एव चकिताः अभूवन्। अथ शरीर-रक्षणाय किञ्चित् नूतनं ज्ञातं वा?  
**Nandini:** The creation is indeed fascinating. Those scientists must truly be astonished. Now, has anything new been discovered regarding health?  

**काव्या:** आम्, वार्द्धक्य-निवारणाय एकः सरलः उपायः शोधकैः प्राप्तः। तैः दृष्टं यत् प्रतिदिनं 'काफी' (Coffee) पेयस्य सेवनेन वयो-वृद्धिः मन्दीकृता। एतेन अभ्यासेन शरीरस्य जीव-कोशाः सुरक्षितीकृताः।  
**Kavya:** Yes. Researchers have found a simple way to slow aging. They observed that drinking coffee daily can delay the process of aging. This habit helps protect the body’s living cells.  

**नन्दिनी:** शोभनम्! 'काफी'-पानं तु बहुभिः क्रियते। अन्यस्मिन् रोग-विषये किं दृष्टम्?  
**Nandini:** Excellent! Many people already drink coffee. Has anything been discovered about other diseases?  

**काव्या:** 'स्टैनफोर्ड'-विश्वविद्यालयस्य शोधकैः एकं महत्-कार्यं साधितम्। तैः ज्ञातं यत् 'विसर्प'-रोगस्य (Shingles) सूच्यौषधेन स्मृति-नाशस्य भयं न्यूनीकृतम्। तत् भयं विंशति-प्रतिशतं यावत् अवरोधितम्।  
**Kavya:** Researchers at Stanford University have achieved something remarkable. They found that the vaccine for shingles helps reduce the risk of memory loss by as much as twenty percent.  

**नन्दिनी:** एतत् तु अति-महत्वपूर्णं वृत्तम्। दर्शकाः, अद्यतने कार्यक्रमे एतावत् एव। पुनर्मेलिष्यावः।  
**Nandini:** That is indeed very important news. Dear viewers, that is all for today’s program. We will meet again.  

**काव्या:** नमो नमः।  
**Kavya:** Farewell and thank you.

I really want to go to Chinatown, I love the food and drinks there, but I’m still hestitate to go. People hanging there always came together, either a friend group or a partner. Just thinking about going there and sitting alone makes me feel so weird and lonely, eventhough I know no one really cares that I’m all by myself. Is there any uncrowded hours that I can go and not be surrounded by groups of people? I don’t hate them, I just hate how easily I teared up these days thinking about lonely moments

So far I have only been to Yintang (the malatang spot) by myself. If you have any restauraunt/boba/coffee shop in Chinatown that you think are single-friendly for beginner, please recommend! 

I used to go there with my close friends, but one passed away months ago and one split up over some issues between us. I’m just by myself in Houston.

1ph1p6k,https://i.redd.it/q49la97hdw5g1.jpeg,TENS machine,"I bought this one https://a.co/d/hiHorUo from amazon.

used the pads on my right ankle as was mentioned in another post here.

the relief was almost immediate. I did the lowest setting for 10 minutes, and I relaxed muscles I didn’t even know I was clenching. urethral pain and bladder discomfort was basically zero. 
I peed before and after, but I have a problem with fully empty my bladder so I think it was just leftover. but now my bladder feels actually empty for the first time in I don’t know how long. 
On a scale of 0-10 of pain with 0 being none, before using the machine my pain was at a 4 or 5. I had a beer (yes, singular) 5 days ago and i was still feeling the consequences. Now, I’m at a 1 or maybe even 0.75. i’m definitely still aware of my pelvic region and can feel it (you may know what I mean) but it’s not painful. I feel an almost cool sensation in my urethra, like lidocaine gel.

my leg also feels a bit odd where the contacts were but it isn’t too bad- feels like the very end stage of your foot falling asleep- after the pins and needles go away and it’s just a static-y feeling.

this is just my first use, I think i’m going to try 10 min 2x daily, once in the morning and once at night.

I can update this post if anyone would find that helpful. maybe I will just to keep a record for myself.

other things I am using-
desert harvest aloe vera- 3 capsules 2x daily
allegra in the mornings for allergies/histamines
prelief acid reducer 20-30 minutes before eating/drinking anything that would cause me a flare
hydroxyzine for histamines and sleep (I have a hard time sleeping when I flare)
sertraline for anxiety and depression (anxiety makes me flare and when i’m depressed I end up not drinking enough water and eating terribly, holding my pee because I don’t have the energy to move, etc)
cystex 3 days before and 3 days after my period
azo during my period and during any other flare
drinking lots of water, heating pad daily, no chocolate, alcohol, or other trigger foods (tomatoes and citrus are big ones for me). I still drink coffee and tea daily, I just can’t quit them.

just wanted to include the other things i’m doing, because i’m not sure if the TENS machine would have the same effect independent of my other medications and preventative measures. also I’ve read it’s best to avoid them if you have a heart condition or something similar. just things to note.

anyways, thought I would share my experience in case it helps someone else.

I (17F) am in a dilemma, and I'd like a bit of Islamic advice. I have been in desperate need of a job for about 6 to 7 months with either nobody around me hiring, or every place I applied to being denied. I finally found a job at a pretty popular coffee shop in which the primary focus is coffee, but they also sell sandwiches that occasionally contain pork. I know that it is haram to sell pork to people, or prepare pork for people, and I'm not in a life or death situation, but I really need this job, and I most likely won't be able to keep it if I don't handle pork at some point. (Handing orders to drive thru customers)
My mother is in an abusive marriage, and me and my sister (19F) both decided to work to help support her, as her husband is not allowing her to work. She is trying to escape the marriage, but currently is not able to because of a very complex situation in court.
I am disabled and in need of a service dog, so I am also working in order to be able to afford that.
In reference to the aforementioned court situation, my father requires me to be to school on time every day (no exceptions, even for emergencies. He is very unreasonable), and my mother is unable to drive me to school. There is no public transit that goes to my area, and my school doesn't provide school busses, so I get to school by Lyft and Uber. Everyday I spend ~$40 just to get to and from school, and I wouldn't be able to afford this without my job. Given all of these circumstances, is working here permissible?

One of the first things he asked me about is sex (im a virgin and he’s not but i’ve done a couple of stuff) he says that he doesn’t care if we never have sex and tells me im his type. After he bails we go back to a strictly teacher-student relationship until a couple of weeks ago where he starts talking more and flirting. He asks me out and I say yes (again :) ), we have dinner and he’s great until we get in the car and start kissing, he asks me to blow him and I say no and he gets upset and I leave home. He texts me at 2am apologizing about his behavior and says that he feels guilty for acting the way he does. I tell him that I was bothered by it and he says he’d like to go out to talk it out, i refuse and we talk about it over texts. He apologizes again and tells me that he’d like to take it slow and make it up to me and we end up flirting a bit.

I get in the car and he immediately gets me coffee and water (mind you he’s being very caring and attentive but doesn’t try to do anything) we talk for a couple of hours and I bring up the whole not-texting, not-seeing each other thing and he says he’ll be better and will be more consistent.

1ph1gzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1ph1gzv/im_guessing_this_is_considered_uars_now/,I'm guessing this is considered UARS now,"37F. I originally had an at home sleep study in June after waiting for months and my fatigue symptoms slowly going away, it was the Alice nightone and I could barely sleep with it and the breathing light would come on even when I was awake. It probably wasn't a good time to do a sleep study, I was going through a horrible acid reflux flare and autonomic nervous system dysfunction from a medication that caused adrenaline surges all night long, and a weird problem where it would feel like I stopped breathing as I was falling asleep, which woke me up over and over all night. I had lost 15lbs from the time the sleep study was ordered and the time I finally got to do it. I started at 185lbs and dropped to 170lbs (I'm only 5'2"").

Results for the June test - I slept for 5 hours, but the device showed 10 hours, so my AHI was possibly higher then. 39 apnea events for an apnea index of 3.9/hour. 57 hypopnea events for an hypopnoea index of 5.4/hour. So it equaled 9.1 AHI but 13.7 on my back. Oxygen saturation was below 89% for 4 minutes and it showed my lowest SpO2 was 82%. 

I tried a CPAP after that, but it was horrible feeling. I have sensory problems with my face, so that doesn't help. It also felt like a wind tunnel trying to suffocate me no matter the settings. I sent it back. I know it helps many people, but it was too much for me.

My sleep specialist wanted to do another sleep study because I had lost around 10lbs (I'm down to 158!) since the last study and I wasn't under the side effects of the medication I was on that originally caused my nervous system to go haywire (I'm now diagnosed with POTS, but it's under control since diagnosis a month ago). Plus, my smartwatch has been showing oxygen consistently above 90% for months now. Smartwatches shouldn't always be trusted, but I figured if it's consistently higher now instead of lower, it must mean something. I couldn't do the hospital home sleep study if it's that Alice Nightone again, plus my hours aren't normal sleeping hours and they're strict about me delivering it back at 10am 40 minutes from my home. So when I was offered a $99 deal through Lofta, I jumped on that instead.

Just got my new results - out of 6 hours of sleep I had a 1.3 AHI, but a 7.6 RDI with 46 events. My minimum oxygen saturation was 90%, mean was 95%, and max was 98%. I didn't snore, which seems correct because I have stopped snoring as much since losing weight.

So this points more toward UARS now? Which would kind of make sense to me after dropping weight and not having nervous system symptoms, this seems more like my baseline that I probably had for years before weight gain from PCOS, and then psoriatic arthritis and Prednisone. I've always had a somewhat stuffed up nose and I have huge tonsils, so big that doctors always comment on them when they see them. My sleep specialist put in for an appointment with an ENT for evaluation, that was before the sleep study though, I'll call them this week since they've never called to make an appointment. I'm not having any symptoms anymore that would point to not getting proper sleep. I had the symptoms all last year or so after my weight went up, but the sleep study took so long to get. I'd highly recommend the Watchpat One test from Lofta though, that was super easy and I liked that I could do it on my time, I didn't have to force myself to sleep. I've already emailed them and requested to send me the PDF report and hopefully raw data file for my sleep specialists records.

I'm just happy that I feel normal again and I surprisingly don't drink coffee or any caffeine anymore, because I don't feel like I need it when I wake up. When I was having symptoms, I drank 24oz of coffee a day, which barely kept me upright.",2,1765162850.0,SleepApnea,0,0.76,False

19
AFAB
Prescribed testosterone, taking every morning (gel)
diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, OCD, gender dysphoria, + undiagnosed eating disorder
no diagnosed physical health problems 



i (19 AFAB) (on testosterone for multiple years) have been having weird symptoms since i developed my restrictive eating disorder that i have since recovered from. 



these symptoms started in around january 2024, my ed started around november 2023. i will feel fine for a few weeks at a time and then for a few days / up to a week, i have these episodes where i need to drink 6+ half liter bottles of water per day, have lots of tachycardia (during my ed it went up to 180bpm or higher when i was standing, but it’s not as bad anymore), my face is constantly red and flushed, i have a headache, chest pain, extreme exhaustion, hands constantly going between purple and cold  and then bright red and burning hot, intense brain fog, i have shortness of breath sometimes, feel “weird” like im gonna pass out if i don’t adjust how im sitting (hard to explain but i just feel unstable and i panic) and all the symptoms / feeling of dehydration despite drinking water. 



i was pre diabetic for a while since recovering from my ED , but i used my moms glucose monitor on multiple occasions recently and confirmed it’s not diabetes or anything bc that runs in my family. my fasting blood sugar was normal i think. 



i’ve had a rlly high heart rate ever since i was a teenager (around age 12) because of constant anxiety and stress (i have multiple mental health conditions, im diagnosed with autism, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and have severe OCD) and i also was on stimulants for a few years (prescribed)  until i had to stop because during my ed it gave me really bad episodes of tachycardia. i had a caffeine obsession for a while (many years). 



i have high cholesterol, it’s not too bad but higher than it should be. i also have high blood pressure but my doctor never treated it as a concern and just thought it was my anxiety. i am overweight but haven’t been this way for a long time because i only entered recovery last year. my situation with my weight is complicated and i don’t let myself check my weight anymore but im definitely fat/ chubby. 




i am on no medications currently and haven’t been for months (since spring) but i used to be on a lot at different times (prozac, zoloft, ritalin, wellbutrin, probably more) 



i think it’s important to mention that my whole life i didn’t  drink enough water, i hated it bc of my sensory issues and my mom just let me not drink it. i only started drinking water every day when i was around 18. i only really drank soda, juice, coffee, lemonade, etc before this. i think that may have caused issues. now i can drink water but only if i chug it all at once. 



i cannot drive and need my family to take me to the doctor and also schedule my appointments for me because of my autism. my mom said she can take me to the doctor soon. 



i’m sorry if this post is stupid or too long, i just wanted to know what  these symptoms could mean? is it heart failure or something else?

1ph1blm,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ph1blm/about_him_about_fear_about_me/,"About him, about fear, about me","I (29f) had an amazing time with him (36m) this week. (Week 6 of talking for anyone who’s been following my dating stories)

We went to a *Kill Bill* movie marathon at this dinner-and-movie place, and afterward we went back to his house for cuddles and intimacy.

We woke up together, played with his two kittens, and he made me coffee before I left.

And honestly… this isn’t the first time he’s made something difficult for me feel softer.

I had to work a 12-hour shift on Thanksgiving and miss spending time with my family… and somehow he still made my Thanksgiving night feel special. He showed up for me in a small but meaningful way, and it meant more to me than I expected.

He saved me a plate of food, let me shower at his place after my long hospital shift, was excited for me to try his family’s traditional holiday drink, and was honestly so sweet and nurturing. He was really looking out for me… that’s something I haven’t felt in a long time.

(It’s usually *me* being the sweet, nurturing one in connections/relationships so I’m truly not used to this).

That’s part of why I’m struggling now.

Because instead of letting myself enjoy these moments, my brain keeps trying to convince me he doesn’t like me as much as I think he does. It’s like the closer I feel to someone, the faster my walls start rebuilding themselves.

I know he has that old FWB situation he’s still in the process of ending. I’m the one who said he didn’t have to cut it off unless we were ready to be exclusive… so I can’t be upset if they’re still talking or even still hooking up. But the thought still lingers. It still pokes at the soft parts of me.

And then yesterday, the day after I saw him, his texting wasn’t as warm or intense. Not cold. Not distant.

Just slightly pulled back, enough for my nervous system to go, *“Oh no… I recognize this. This is when things usually go wrong.”*

Suddenly I’m worried he’s talking to other girls, or being just as sweet with them, or trying to “figure things out” the way he’s figuring things out with me. I’m scared I’m liking someone who might not choose me in the long run.

But, I have to remind myself… nothing he’s done actually suggests disinterest.

He said he had a busy weekend. He still reached out. He’s been consistent. He’s treated me kindly. He’s shown up for me in ways that mattered.

The problem isn’t him, *it’s my history.*

My past experiences taught me that intimacy is followed by absence.

That connection is followed by withdrawal.

That if I don’t brace myself, I’ll get blindsided.

So now I can feel my walls rebuilding, not because of anything he’s done, but because I’m afraid of letting something good matter. I’m afraid of hoping for something and then watching it slip through my fingers.

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest.

To admit that sometimes when things are going well, my instinct is to run, or overthink, or prepare for disappointment.

That I’m trying to unlearn that reflex. Trying to stay open. Trying to trust what’s happening instead of the story my fear keeps telling me.

I… I like him. I’m just scared. And I’m trying to let that be okay.

🍫This popcorn bark is one of my favorite treats, and it’s perfect for the holidays! Plus, this is a MUST for my other friends that love sweet-salty desserts. 

🍿 When you make popcorn for the holidays this season, don’t toss out the unpopped kernels! Instead, add them to your coffee or spice grinder and grind into a powder. To make sure no hard parts escape grinding, give it a sift to remove any hard pieces that could hurt your teeth. Then, sprinkle generously over your melted chocolate so each bite is filled with rich chocolate and salty popcorn flavor. 

All you need are: 

\+ Vegan chocolate chips 

\+ Popcorn 

\+ Flaky or coarse sea salt 

\+ Unpopped popcorn kernel dust (optional) 

💚 We make this more sustainable by using vegan ingredients, repurposing unpopped popcorn kernels instead of tossing in the trash, and letting the bark cool on an eco-friendly (compostable) parchment paper. 

🧐 Do you have a use for your unpopped kernels? Would love to hear! ",3,1765162276.0,veganrecipes,1,0.67,False

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.  
I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living in Japan right now, or already in the US)
* 23–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me:  
You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

Reply with:

1. One thing you’d love to do together on a lazy Sunday
2. Where you are right now (city/prefecture in Japan, or US city)
3. One question for me

I'm looking for some feedback and perhaps advice on our website. We launched in March of this year, and I have built the website over time by myself. 

I feel pretty good with what I've made at this point, but we're trying to improve our online sales. For reference we have not done any paid ads yet, just relying on organic search and keywords (I think), as well as personal promotion on podcasts, publications, and industry events. 

I'm a little concerned that some of my updates for apps like Yotpo and adding javascript for Google search console may have done some things that slow down the site or caused other issues.

""Do you see anything obvious that may keep us from converting"" and

1ph15xd,https://www.reddit.com/r/berlinsocialclub/comments/1ph15xd/my_perspective_on_how_to_build_relationshipsmake/,My perspective on how to build relationships/make friends in Berlin.,"Over the last few months I've seen quite a few posts about people having a hard time meeting people in Berlin, and it's a subject that fascinates me a lot, hence the long post! I've spoken to many, many people about it at meetups here. As someone who has lived in quite a few different European cities, (9 cities for more than 3+ months, 4 cities for 18+ months, 12 years in total), who has therefore had to rebuild my friendship group again and again, who also thinks that meeting people in Berlin is much easier than in other cities, I thought I'd give my perspective in the hope that it's useful for someone.  I guess it could apply to any city, but I'm basing a lot of this on first hand interactions with the people I've met, and conversations I've had with people who said that this feedback was helpful for them. 

- Don't confuse German directness with rudeness. I've seen conversations first hand where someone new to the city says that they went to a certain club, or they are renting in a certain area for a certain price, and a local will say, ""that's not a great club"", or, ""yeah, that's not a great area to choose to live in!"" I've seen new arrivals to the city say, ""my German isn't great, I'm looking for a job where I only need to speak English ..."", and I've seen their reaction to a local saying, ""no, I don't think you'll be successful with that approach."" They get nervous at the ""confrontation"" and they retreat into their shell, and in my opinion it's a big reason why so many people find it hard to connect with people here, as they confuse ""directness"" with ""confrontation"" or ""rudeness.""  It's not meant as a criticism of your character, or an assessment of you as a person, it's often just an opinion that is meant in an honest way, as a way to give honest feedback. The British tendency to be ""diplomatic"" and nod along and be supportive is often taken for insincerity in Germany. Just because they disagree with you, it doesn't mean that they don't like you. 

- Don't be too disheartened when people don't reply to messages.  In other countries I've lived in, (especially Spain and Portugal), if you ask if people want to come out you'll get loads of responses, whether they want to or not. In Berlin, less so, it's often just radio silence. 5 weeks in a row you'll send messages to the group chat asking if anyone is available, you'll hear nothing. On the 6th week, 8+ people are available. Don't take their non reply negatively, their non reply doesn't mean that they don't WANT to come, just that the schedule may not work for them. 

- This is contrary to what a lot of people advise, but don't limit yourself only to events that you are really passionate about.  Sometimes it doesn't matter WHAT you do, so long as you connect with the other people there. I organise get-togethers where we go to lower league Berlin football clubs, from the 4th to the 7th division, (DM me if you want to join us)  and when I mention it to some people they say, ""oh, that's not for me, I don't like football..."" Quite a few of the group aren't huge football fans though, they just use it as a way to get out and meet people, have a couple of beers, and have an event to chat at, or to explore a part of town they haven't been to, or even somewhere outside of Berlin. At many games we will spend the whole time chatting about life, and then when there is a break in the conversation we can watch the game.  I've been to Christian meetups as an atheist, I've been to tech meetups where I am not great with tech, I've been to book clubs where I didn't enjoy the books, but I've still got a lot out of the meetups as the other people attending these events were nice people. It often doesn't really matter why you have attended a meetup, the important thing is that you connect with the people there, and you'll never know if that will happen unless you turn up. You might not connect with them on so many subjects, but you may find one subject that you do connect with them on. 

- Don't read too much into Reddit threads about how tough it is to meet people in Berlin. The venn diagram between people who find it hard to leave the house/apartment and meet people, and the people who like to moan about not being able to meet people in Berlin on Reddit, has a huge crossover. When you actually meet people at meetups, usually they have great experiences of meeting people. Reddit is not real life. If you talk to people who spend their whole time on Reddit, they will tell you how isolating Berlin is. For some people, they are always on Reddit as they feel isolated in Berlin, and they are isolated in Berlin as they are always on Reddit. Don't listen to them, get out there instead.

- Keep the process of meeting people in perspective. If you go to 10 events, and 9 of them don't work, but you meet a couple of great friends at the 10th event, that's a 90% fail rate, but if you go to 50 events a year, you will pretty much have all of the friends you need, and it'll be a great success overall. Brush off the bad nights, and build on the good ones. If you also feel that the only point of going to these events is to make long-term relationships, and if you have the attitude of ""I'm not going to bother going to that event anymore, because I don't make any deep relationships there, only superficial ones"", then you would have to start to wonder why you find it so tiresome to go to them? Maybe there's a relationship between that attitude, and how difficult it is for you to build friendships? I've seen a direct correlation between people just enjoying going to meet ups, even if they never meet the people again, and naturally being able to make friends. A key part of making friends is just to like being around other people, and if you find that tiresome, you should probably look at why that is.

- I've met SO MANY people who have said ""the annoying thing about Berlin is that you'll have a great night out, but then no one wants to swap phone numbers and meet up afterwards."" Yet these same people wait for others to offer their phone number first.  Plan ahead: print out a sheet of QR code links to your WhatsApp number, cut one of them out, and when you go to a good event, leave it on the table and announce that if anyone wants your contact details, they can scan the code. If you make it easier for people to take your contact details, they will probably do it more. 

- just because an event/meetup has a bad night, it doesn't mean it's a bad meetup. I've been to 2-3 regular events in a row where there were 2-3 people at them, and then the 4th event had 30+ people at it. Sometimes it's just unpredictable, it is how it is, and I've met loads of great friends at the 10th, 15th or 20th event of a meetup. On the other hand I've seen people join a WhatsApp/Telegraph group, come to one event, they were disappointed with the amount of people there, or the other people were 15 minutes late, and they left the group immediately. Then I ran into them 5 months later and they are still annoyed at how hard it is to meet people. If you dump people at the first opportunity because things aren't perfect, don't then complain that it's hard to meet people. I once planned to meet up with someone and they couldn't make it 4 times in a row, but as I planned to also meet with other people as well, it didn't really impact me. Then when we did meet, it was great, we've got a great friendship. 

- Instead of writing a Reddit post to ask if anyone wants to meet up in Berlin, just contact the other people who have already made the same posts. Do a quick search, and loads of them will come up. I have had conversations with people who say that it's very difficult to meet up with people in Berlin, who also say that they did Reddit posts and didn't get any response, but then when I ask if they replied to anyone else's posts, they admit that they didn't. If you aren't going to contact other people who have also tried to make friends, then don't be surprised if you don't get much of a response yourself.

- There are no benefits to raising your expectations of Berlin too high. Some people move here as they think it's the epicentre of everything that they think is cool, in their mind it's a city with 10/10 potential, so when they find that they are ""only"" getting 8/10 out of the city, it's a disappointment. It's like New Year's Eve: it's not the night that's that problem, it's your expectations. Berlin is a fantastic city, but if it can't live up to your expectations, that's not the city's fault, it's yours for putting too much of a burden on it. Accept that not every night is going to be amazing, ride the peaks and the troughs. 

- Don't turn up to meetups too late. So many times there's a meetup from 7pm - 11pm, and someone will turn up at 9:30pm, at which time everyone is involved in a deep conversation, everyone has locked into their conversation, so the new arrival either feels left out, or they need to purposely interrupt the other conversations that are happening, which can come across as quite rude. They then overcompensate as they only have a short amount of time, so they come across as very intense. If you get there earlier you have a chance to chat to people more while there's less people there, in a more relaxed manner, where you can take your time and not force the conversation. 

- Don't try to dominate the conversion. If you're talking ALL OF THE TIME, don't automatically think that it's because people love to listen to you. Often they just can't work out how to move the conversation on as you're talking so much. Likewise, I've found that sometimes striking up a conversation with someone who is very quiet at a meetup can often spark the best conversations and friendships. 

- Don't waste your energy on people who don't want to agree with you. There is a difference between ""people who don't agree with you"", and ""people who don't WANT to agree with you."" Some people just like being contrary, and for some reason it's much more common in Berlin than in any other city I've lived in. You say that you like living in the city centre? ""It's too touristy."" You live outside the ring? ""Nothing happens there."" You say how much you like going to clubs? ""It was better 10 years ago.""  Everyone has their own opinion, but Berlin has more people than any other city I've seen that love to be contrary, for some reason, and if you try to win them over, to change their point of view, then you're missing the point. They WANT to disagree with you, and the more you try to win them over, the more they will dig in. Just allow them to disagree with you and move on. 

- Don't criticise the meetup that you're attending, or others that you have attended. ""Is this all that's coming tonight?! I would have thought there would be more than this!! There's barely anyone here!"" Look, it's hard sometimes to get meetups off of the ground, and the people who organise them are usually part of multiple meetup groups, so don't go undermining the effort that they put into the night, even if the turnout isn't great. They're trying their best. Likewise, if you start listing the other meetups you've been to, and why they weren't great, it's easy to come across as a very negative person, and that's not going to make people want to connect with you. 

- Don't expect the people at meetup events to solve your problems for you. Out of all of the cities I've been based in, this has also happened here way more than in any other place.  We get it: Berlin can be stressful, but that doesn't mean you should vent about how difficult it is to find a job, or a cheap apartment, or how hard it is to learn the language, or to build meaningful relationships. I've seen it multiple times where someone at a meetup just unloaded and vented all of their angst within the first few minutes of meeting people, and it doesn't exactly endeer people to you. I get why you would do it, because the people at the meet up would probably understand it much more than your family at home, but still, the people you meet have their own issues to deal with without solving your issues for you. Keep things light the first couple of times you meet people. 

- Berlin is a big city, so treat it as such. Just because an event is busy one week, doesn't mean that it will be the same the next time. With so much to do here, many people like to flitter from one event to the next. There's a thousand things to do here, don't be surprised or complain that you connect with someone at one event, and then don't see them again for a few months.   If you want to see the same people every single week, you should move to a small town. Most people move to Berlin to have a choice of different things to do. Accept that it's a big city, and that people will drop in and out of things.  Most intense relationships are formed at a time in life when you have a lot more time on your hands, such as at school, university, while doing casual jobs, and when you have more free time then the relationships you build can be a lot more intense. However, not many people in Berlin have that much free time, they may be working lower paid jobs and need to work many hours as a result, or they have a job with more responsibility, so it can be tough to build very deep relationships. I have seen it happen, but you just have to be patient. 

- Be flexible with the location of events where you meet people. Just because it's 45 minutes away by train, that's not THAT far.   The further you are willing to go, the more chance you have of meeting people that you connect with. Again, if you don't want to travel too far, move to a village, not a big city. 

- Stop trying to get people to ""adopt"" you. I've literally heard several people say, ""I'm disillusioned with drugs and clubbing, i need a friendship group with people in long term relationships, with stable jobs and apartments, as that's what my aim is now, I want to be around those people.""  Or, ""I'm finding it hard to find a good stable job, and I think it's because I'm hanging out with people with no focus. If I can find a group of people who have stable jobs, I can be more connected to that world."" I've been to meetups where I've seen someone 4 or 5 times before, with them taking no interest in chatting to me in the past events, and then when they find out that I work in a industry that they are trying to break into, suddenly they are all over you like a rash and trying to arrange to meet up for coffee. You're basically advertising that you are only meeting people to get what you can out of them, like a leech.  Most people have a hard enough time keeping on track with their own lives, let alone helping you to do the same. If you start a relationship on the basis of, ""I'm going to meet people so that I can get something out of them"", it often comes across as a lot more obvious than you realise.

How can I organize/motivate myself better so I stop doing stupid things like this?,Today was the first pretty day in a while and my gf and I wanted to take our dogs to the park. She left to DoorDash and I agreed to be the one to take them to the park. I woke up late and couldn’t motivate myself so I made a cup of coffee and as I started drinking it my friends wanted to play a game on Xbox so I figured I’d hop on for like 30 minutes while I sip my coffee and then get going. Several hours later I get a message on the Xbox from my gf asking if I’d already taken the dogs and I said no. I hopped off at this point but it was already dark outside and I knew I fucked up. I was so happy with myself for being on top of things for the past few days and I just ruined today for my dogs. I really started freaking out and tried to load them into my truck but they ended up getting away from me because I was freaking out and distracted. They ran into the highway but avoided all cars. I tried running after them but they left my sight and I didn’t know what direction the went in. About half an hour later I found them in a neighbors yard and they ran to me. It was really stressful but it could have been avoided if I didn’t stress so much about messing up so badly.

By Andrew Wong, Straits Times. 

SINGAPORE - The sale listing for a 32,000 sq ft commercial building in the crosshairs of an [ongoing money laundering probe](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/how-accused-kingpin-chen-zhi-built-an-empire-from-cambodia-to-london?ref=inline-article) in Singapore and the US was taken down just three days after it was put up.

Located in the Bukit Merah vicinity, the property known as 2 Jalan Kilang Barat was put up for sale for some $50 million on Dec 2.

No reasons were offered for the listing’s removal.

**Meanwhile, The Straits Times has learnt that the building’s owner – 25-year-old Chen Xiaoxuan – is assisting the Singapore Police Force (SPF) with its investigations into embattled Cambodian businessman Chen Zhi.**

**Her father, Mr Tan Yew Kiat, 49, was arrested over his suspected involvement in money laundering offences.**

Police had raided his office in Kung Chong Road in late November in connection with the US probe into Chen Zhi.

Originally from China, Chen Zhi heads the Prince Group, which is involved in property development and financial services.

The 38-year-old tycoon and his close adviser Chen Xiuling, or Karen Chen, were named by the US and Britain in sweeping sanctions announced on Oct 14 for their links to wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies, as well as their roles in forced labour scam compounds across Cambodia.

**The property 2 Jalan Kilang Barat was identified in the US probe as the address in Singapore for 11 companies directly linked to Chen Zhi, and three companies linked to Chen Xiuling.**

ST had earlier revealed that the building was purchased by 2JKB, a firm Ms Chen Xiaoxuan incorporated in December 2022, just seven months before it secured the property.

ESR-LOGOS REIT, which held the deed then, had reportedly divested the property for $35.3 million in November 2022, and it was later put up for sale.

The property agent who listed the property on Dec 2 did not respond to ST’s request for comments.

Ms Chen is also listed as a director of Supreme Cars Financial Services, Rolls Platform, and Cars and Coffee Leasing.

**All the firms are registered to the same 2 Jalan Kilang Barat address.**",2,1765161727.0,SingaporeRaw,3,0.75,False

A cinematic shot, side view, a young girl is sitting at a desk next to a window in the background. Outside the window it is nighttime, and raining. Rivulets of water drip on the window pane.

A cat sits on the window sill, looking out into the night.

A small leafy plant rests on the desk near the window. A stack of three books and a brown mug sits next to the potted plant.

A copper-toned adjustable lamp reaches over the desk shining a light near the girls head.

The room is dark, the only source of light comes from the lamp, casting long shadows on the walls and corners of the room. The tone of the scene is quiet, dark and cozy.

The girl is seated in a high-backed red velvet chair. She is wearing a green woolen sweater and a red knitted scarf. She is wearing black wired headphones. Her chin rests on her right hand while her left hand rests on the table.

A wooden bookshelf takes the space in the background behind the chair.

In the foreground, a cylindrical desk organizer holds a pair of scissors, some paint brushes, pens and pencils.

The tricky part was getting the rhyming algorithm correct. I ended up building a 500k word dataset because as it turned out, none of the existing material was enough to make the game feasible.

I had a bump in the relationship around a month ago that made me realize I wasn't taking care of myself. I was overweight, my diet sucked with constant snacking, zero exercise, and most of my job involved me sitting on my ass 8 hours a day then did more of the same when I got home. I weighed myself for the first time in years and found that I was over 40 pounds above where I was at in my prime 5 years ago.

So last month I got serious. Started slow with 16:8 IF and light weights at the gym so I wouldn't get too sore. About a week in I turned it up. I would as get many steps in as I could whenever I had a break at work and lifted heavier at the gym everyday after work, then hit my gym's sauna. More importantly, I did all this fasted with at most a cup of black coffee in the stomach, and most days did OMAD with one meal at the end of the day, usually a meat and a vegetable. A few times I was able to throw in a 48 hour fast where I wasn't hungry when the time came to have my one meal, so I skipped it and waited to eat until the meal at the end of the next day. I cut out a lot of the crap I was eating before including soda, processed food, chips, etc.

In my mind I was thinking I would feel fatigued because I was depriving myself of food, but I actually felt the opposite - energy, mood, and focus were better, especially at work where I was always in a fasted state. After a month of this I weighed myself and am 10 pounds down from where I started. I really like this routine I have going and I can it's much better than I what I was doing for myself in the past. Hoping to keep this up for as long as I can.

Hi Reddit. I (66F) am writing this with shaking hands because I truly cannot believe what I just heard.

To give you some background: I am a retired nurse. I worked in the ER for 40 years, pulling double shifts and missing holidays to pay for the house I live in. It’s a beautiful two-story colonial that my late husband and I bought three decades ago. It is my pride and joy, and more importantly, it is paid off.

Two years ago, my son “Malik” (32M) and his wife “Keisha” (30F) came to me with a sob story. Their rent had gone up, they were drowning in debt, and they needed a place to stay to “get back on their feet.” Being a mother, I said yes. I even gave them the Master Suite (my room) because Keisha complained that the guest room was too cramped for a couple. I moved into the smaller guest room down the hall.

It was supposed to be for six months. It has been two years. They have not paid a dime in rent.

Yesterday, I was walking up the stairs with a basket of their laundry (yes, I still wash their clothes). As I reached the landing, I heard loud voices coming from the Master Suite. The door was thin, and Keisha was shouting.

“My mom is sick, Malik! She needs to move in here. We need the Master Suite for us, and she can take the guest room.”

I paused. The guest room is where I sleep.

I heard my son ask, weak and quiet, “But what about my mom? Where does she go?”

Keisha’s answer is burned into my brain. She snapped: **“Dump her at the old folks' home! Shady Pines has a bed open. She’s had her time. This is** ***our*** **house now. We need to prioritize our future.”**

I stood there, clutching that laundry basket, waiting for Malik to explode. Waiting for him to tell her that this is *my* house, that I am not a piece of furniture to be tossed out.

Instead, I heard him sigh. “You’re right. I’ll tell her. She has to leave by the first of the month.”

I didn’t confront them. I dropped the basket—it made a huge crash—and walked back downstairs before they could see me. They think I slipped or dropped something. They don’t know I heard the plan.

Since then, Keisha has been leaving nursing home brochures on the kitchen counter with the cheapest rooms circled in red. She even invited her mother, “Brenda,” over to measure my room for new curtains while I was sitting right there.

They seem to think that because I am old and quiet, I am also stupid. They think that because they live here, they own it.

But they forgot one very important detail: **My name is the only one on the Deed.**

I have not said a word to them. Instead, I went to my safe, retrieved the original deed, and called a lawyer. Then I called the Sheriff.

Malik thinks “The First” is the day I move out. He is about to find out it’s actually the day he learns a very hard lesson about ownership.

Am I wrong for not giving them a warning? Part of me feels like a mother should always protect her child, but another part of me feels like that child died the moment he agreed to “dump” me.

# Update: “I am the landlord, not the tenant.”

It has been a week, and let me tell you, it has been the longest week of my life.

Thank you to everyone in the comments who told me to stand my ground. I read every single one of them while Keisha was busily packing up my porcelain figurines into boxes marked “Goodwill.”

Here is what went down on the First of the Month.

The morning started early. Keisha was practically vibrating with excitement. Her mother, Brenda, arrived at 8:00 AM sharp with three suitcases, looking around my living room like she was the new queen of the castle.

“Is the room ready?” Brenda asked. “I don’t do stairs well.”

Keisha smiled and said, “Almost, Mama. The van for Shady Pines is coming at 9:00 to pick up Estelle. Then we can paint.”

I was standing by the window, drinking my coffee in my best Sunday suit. I hadn’t packed a single box.

Keisha noticed and frowned. “Estelle, why aren’t you ready? The movers charge by the hour.”

I just smiled and said, “Oh, the movers are already here.”

Right on cue, two massive 26-foot moving trucks backed into the driveway.

Keisha looked confused. “Two trucks? Why? You don’t have that much stuff. And they’re huge.”

Then, a Prince George’s County Sheriff cruiser pulled up behind the trucks.

The color drained from Malik’s face. “Mom? Why is the Sheriff here?”

I put my coffee cup down. I walked to the front door and opened it. Deputy Miller (a lovely man I spoke to earlier in the week) stepped onto the porch.

“Are you Malik and Keisha Carter?” he asked.

“Yes,” Malik stammered.

The Deputy handed them a manila envelope. “This is a Writ of Possession for the property at 442 Maple Drive. The owner, Estelle V. Carter, has terminated your tenancy effective immediately due to unauthorized occupants and failure to pay rent.”

Keisha shrieked. It was a sound I’ll never forget. “What?! This is illegal! This is OUR house! She agreed to leave! She’s going to a nursing home!”

I stepped forward then. I pulled the original Deed out of my purse and held it up. The gold seal caught the sunlight.

**“I am not going anywhere, Keisha,”** I said, keeping my voice calm. **“I am not the tenant. I am the landlord. And you have two hours to get your things onto those trucks before the locks are changed.”**

Malik started crying. Actually crying. He tried to grab my hand. “Mom, please. You can’t do this. We’re family. We made a mistake.”

I pulled my hand away. “You were right about one thing, Malik. You need to prioritize your future. And you can’t do that while living off your mother.”

I spent the next three hours sitting on my porch rocker, watching the movers—whom *I* hired—clear out the Master Suite. They took the “Italian leather” sofa Keisha insisted on buying. They took Malik’s 80-inch TV. They took everything that wasn’t mine.

Keisha spent the entire time screaming on her phone to a lawyer who apparently told her she had no leg to stand on. Brenda sat on her suitcases in the driveway, smoking cigarettes and glaring at Keisha, furious that she had given up her apartment for nothing.

When the trucks were fully loaded, the foreman handed me a key to a storage unit.

I walked down the steps to where Malik was sitting, head in his hands.

“Here,” I said, handing him the storage key. “Everything is in a unit on Route 301. It’s paid for one month. After that, it’s on you.”

“Where are we supposed to sleep?” he asked, looking like a lost child.

“I heard the Holiday Inn has vacancies,” I said. “Or maybe you can find a place that accepts ‘broke energy.’”

I went back inside, closed the heavy oak door, and locked it. The locksmith arrived ten minutes later to re-key every door in the house.

It is now 9:00 PM. The house is quiet. My Master Suite is empty, but it smells like *my* house again. I put my old quilt on the air mattress in the center of the room, and tonight, I am going to sleep like a baby.

My son has sent me 30 texts apologizing, saying Keisha is “sorry” and they want to come for Sunday dinner to “talk it out.”

I haven't replied. I think I’m going to be busy on Sunday. I have a craft room to set up in the guest room, and a whole lot of peace and quiet to enjoy.

It’s *all* the regular stuff here about everything like paywall and generative AI stuff. Please just don’t do it. (if you do early access that’s okay) Of course, I really appreciate when you notify me with a comment or message or whatever. Thanks! 

\[sfx: knock/doorbell, door opening\]

\[Chearful\] 

Knock knock! 

Now boarding the 4 AM early ass express shuttle! 

…

\[Huff\] 

Of course I’m on time. Only here to give you a ride to the airport- even though you know I would be happy to tag along as backup.

…

\[Exasperated\]  

What do I mean? Look, *you can* put on that fake smile around your family, but I see right through you. I know you better than that. You’re not looking forward to this at all. Christmas should not be so stressful and depressing. It is supposed to be whimsical and magical and all that bullshit. So what if we're adults? We can still enjoy ourselves around the holidays. Hell, we’re adults- the holidays are practically the only time we have to actually relax. I wish you would just put yourself first every once in a while. 

…

\[sigh\]

Well, I might not agree with your stupid decisions, but what kind of best friend would I be if I didn’t at least try to talk you out of them… all while actively enabling you? 

 …

\[taken aback\]

Hold up- *you* thought I was just going to pick you up and send you on your merry way without even trying to fight you on this? 

…

\[Confident\]

Oh, yeah. I intend to spend the entire drive doing my very best to convince you to “accidentally” miss your flight. 

…

\[sarcastic\]

Yes, what an utter tragedy! Having to spend the holidays with your best friend who adores you- as opposed to a bunch of people who only pretend to care.

…

\[mocking\]

Ooh look at us! What a big happy family! We all love each other! Look at us spending the day together in our stupid matching ugly ass sweaters! 

…

\[Knowing\]

Umn, no, you and I both know that no one there would miss you. They only want you there for appearances. And I know that gets to you- the entire facade of it all. I wish it didn’t translate to you being such a grouch about everything Christmas related… but we can work on that.

…

\[teasing\]

Alright, fine, be grumpy then. I guess it’s probably a little too early in the morning for anything else. Honestly, it’s starting to make sense that you refuse to see reason. You don’t really even look awake yet. Did you end up getting any sleep?

…

\[flat\]

Really? Because I remember receiving a text pretty late last night… something about not having even started packing?

…

\[disappointed\]

Everytime with the procrastination! I’ll admit… there was maybe half of a second where I got my hopes up. I guess I honestly thought you might have been reconsidering the whole trip…

.

\[sigh\]

No, I know you already bought the ticket. I just… ugh. Look, we’ve been over it. I know what I think doesn’t matter. 

Let’s get this over with. 

…

Here, let me throw your bags in the trunk. These ones, yeah? The suitcase and duffle?

…

\[sfx: lifting/moving heavy bags\] 

.

\[surprised grunting/laughing\]

Damn, okay. I know you said you got everyone books for Christmas but are you sure you didn’t swap them for bricks? Or maybe rocks? I know the lot of them deserve nothing but coal, but you’ll put Santa out of a job at this rate. 

\[exaggerated\] 

Holy shit, these *are* heavy. You sure you’re going to be able to manage them by yourself? Or that they’re not going to cost a fortune to fly with? There’s no way these are under 50 lbs/23 kg.

…

\[resigned\]

Yeah, yeah, I know that’s not going to change your mind. 

…

\[sfx: car door/trunk opening, bags loading, closing, doors opening and closing for speaker and listener, seatbelts, car starting, etc\]

.

Alright, hot chocolate or eggnog? I grabbed both- wasn’t sure what you’d be in the mood for. I thought about bringing you a coffee, but I figured you’d want to try to sleep on the flight.

…

\[faux professional\]

Mhm, premium service as your airport chauffeur. Make sure to give me that fancy gold star… or uh… five star? Okay, I don’t know, whatever it is- just give me a good rating on “Besties Uber” or whatever. 

…

\[teasing\]

Look, I’m just trying to help ease you into the holiday spirit. I’d hate for you to choke when it gets shoved down your throat the moment you step inside your family’s house. 

*Think* of it like an inoculation. Now, eggnog, or cocoa?

…

Solid choice. Here you *go*. 

…

\[exasperated\]

Oh, just shut up and drink it. Even if you’re hellbent on convincing everyone that you hate all of this, I can tell you need it. You can have seasonal spite and still enjoy the sweets. 

.

\[genuine\]

I’ve got you, okay? Even if all I can do to make things easier is give you a ride and bring a little pick-me-up, I’m doin it. 

…

\[Mortified\]

Are you serious? No, I did not spike it for you. Look, even if you’re gonna need a couple drinks before you deal with family- they’re not gonna let you through TSA if you’re drunk. 

…

Yep, that’s me- always here to think ahead and take care of you despite your insistence on making stupid decisions. 

.

\[sigh\] 

Sometimes, I don’t know why I bother.

…

\[exasperated again\]

No, of course you’re worth it. You know I love you, dumbass. Obviously. You think I’d do this for anyone else? 

…

\[resolute\]

Actually, you know what- I’m switching tactics. I should know better than to use logic with you- especially when you’re half asleep. Let’s try some empathy instead. 

You really gonna make me spend the holidays alone?

…

Yep, I am absolutely going to pull that card. I don’t care if it’s low. When I started working from home you wouldn’t shut up about how worried you were about me being antisocial. Imagine how much lonelier I’m going to be spending Christmas. All. By. Myself. 

…

\[getting frustrated\]

Come on, don’t make that face. It’s not like I want to guilt trip you, but if you won’t put yourself first, will you at least think about me? It’s not like I’m even asking much! 

.

\[earnest\]

When we spend time together you always tell me how much you enjoy being with me- how happy you are that you don’t have to pretend around me.  

I want you to be yourself. Exactly as you are.  

.

\[upset\]

But anytime you see them, you come back so drained- practically just a shell of yourself- every part of you distorted and forcibly rearranged after trying to be someone you’re not. 

Do you have any idea how much it hurts to see you like that?

…

\[hurt\]

Is it really so hard to choose me instead? You know that I would choose you over anyone else- everyone else. You’re all I need. I… I love you. 

.

\[quiet/desperate\]

Don’t you love me?

…

\[repeating flatly\] 

It’s not like that? 

.

\[scoff\]

Sure. Sure it’s not. But you know what? Fine. Whatever. 

I see how it is. 

…

\[deep breaths/sigh\]

.

\[Apologetic\]

No, no, I’m… I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to get upset. Fuck, please don’t look at me like that. 

Look, if you’re still set on going… Fine, I get it. I’m sorry I pushed, okay? I’m done, I promise. I’m done. That was my last argument. 

.

\[forced casual\]

I’m out of options. I didn’t want to have to do this, but I guess we need to stop by my place so I can grab your present. 

…

Nah, just a quick stop. I know you’re anxious about missing your flight, but we still have plenty of time.

Whoa there, you look a little unsteady. Are you alright?

…

No, no, you look really pale. I think you should sit down.

\[Thoughtful\]

I mean… I didn’t think the drugs would kick in so hard that quickly, but come on, let’s get you to the couch before you fall. 

\[sfx: flomp onto couch sounds\]

\[conversational\]

Mhm, I did say drugs. Nothing dangerous, don’t you worry. Just something to put you to sleep for a bit.

.

\[chuckle\]

Honestly- I thought you were onto me when you mentioned spiking your drink earlier. Really had me spooked for a moment before I realized what you meant. Either way, I’m sorry I had to lie to you, but you didn’t give me an out.

…

\[a touch condescending\]

But see, everything is going to be okay. There’s some good news anddd some bad news, but I think it all just depends on your perspective. 

See, the good news is that you’re getting some much needed rest and… 

.

\[sarcastic\]

…well… The bad news is that you’re definitely going to miss your flight. 

...

\[sarcastic af\] 

How very unfortunate. 

…

\[sfx: begin fading out the speaker’s voice\]

Awww, I have absolutely no idea what you’re trying to say- those words were far too slurred to make out. Don’t worry, just close your eyes. You’ll feel better after you’ve gotten some sleep. 

...

\[shushing\]

There you go. That’s it. Shhh. Everything is okay. You’re okay. Just go to sleep.

...

\[Enthusiastically\] 

Good morning, sleepyhead! 

...

\[sfx: listener struggling/chains/etc\]

\[worried\]

Hey! No, stop that. Please, I need you to lie still. Those cuffs are meant to be soft, but I don’t want you to hurt yourself struggling like that. 

No, no, hey, come on, you need to calm down. You’re okay, I promise! Everything is okay. 

...

Take some deep breaths. I know it might be a little bit difficult with the gag, but come on, you need to breathe. 

...

\[more firmly\]

I said, you need to breathe. 

...

\[frustrated\]

No, no, no! Stop thrashing like that! I said, “Stop!” 

Hey! Look at me! Come on, come on, just look at me, damn it!

...

\[quieter/focused\]

Hey, dumbass, you are going to pass out again if you keep hyperventilating like this. Is that what you want?

...

\[condescending\] 

No?

Didn’t think so. 

...

\[forced calm\]

So. Just. Breathe. 

In and out. Like this. 

...

\[couple deep breaths\]

Come on. I’ve got you. You’re okay. Let’s do a couple more. It’s okay. You’re okay.

...

\[grabbing listener\]

No, hey, I didn’t say you could look away from me. Look into my eyes and breathe.  

...

\[relaxing a lil\] 

Shhh, there we go. Just like that. Shh, you’re alright. There we go… 

...

\[exasperated sigh\]

Finally.  

I promise, I am going to explain everything, but I need you to just relax and listen. Can you do that for me, Pet?

...

\[taunting\]

Yes, I see the confusion written across your face. You heard me right- I called you “pet.” If you want an explanation, I need you to cooperate.

...

\[trying to be patient\]

Yeahhhh, okay, so I’m going to need something a little more concrete. Do me a favor and nod for me. 

...

\[gently teasing\]

Mmm, the way you mumbled into that gag was cute and all, but I couldn’t make out what you were trying to say. 

...

\[sigh\]

Oh, come on, don’t just look at me. I’m not going to take it off- those pleading eyes might usually get you your way, but not this time.

Look, I know you’re panicking. I don’t blame you, but I also know you’d try to wake up the entire neighborhood screaming if I let you.  

...

\[irritated\]

No, don’t shake your head. Don’t even try to lie to me. You’re acting like I haven’t known you all your life. I know you- how you think, how you feel, how you react. 

...

\[calming breath\]

Right now, I know you’re scared, and that’s understandable, but if you would just cooperate for a minute I’ll explain everything.

...

\[sympathetic chuckle\]

Aww that was adorable, puppy, but it almost sounded like you were trying to ask me to let you go.

 ...

\[repeating\]

Let you go…?

\[optional to the tune of Let It Snow\]

Let you go, let you go, let you go…

...

\[soft, regretful\]

No. No I don’t think I will. I can’t. 

...

\[serious\]

I can’t let you go and I can’t take the gag off because I need you to actually listen. 

I know that I could have said anything earlier and it wouldn’t have changed your mind because you refused to actually hear me.

I’m sorry it had to come to this, but you forced my hand. 

...

Now show me you’re listening. Come on, Puppy. 

...

\[satisfied\]

There we go. Good pet. Was that so hard?

...

\[sigh\]

Look, I didn’t want to have to do anything this drastic but I couldn’t let you get on that plane. I couldn’t just let you leave. 

...

\[insistent\] 

I couldn’t let you go back to those people. I care about you, hell, I love you- but I don’t think I can handle putting you back together after standing idly by while they break you. 

Not again.

I am your best friend and it’s my job to protect you. From everyone! From strangers, from your family, and damn it, when I have to, from yourself. 

...

\[frustrated\]

Like now- when you decide to make these insane choices! What? You think they suddenly care about you? You think they all got visits from the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future and had a miraculous change of heart? 

You are Not. This. Naive. 

...

Don’t look at me like that- yes, I always call you names and talk to you like you’re stupid but I know you aren't. 

You know how bad those people are for you. You know how much they hurt you and I’ll never understand why you refuse to take that into account. 

...

\[sigh\] \[voice breaking a lil\]

That’s a lie. God, I hate it so much, but I know why you do it. 

It’s because you don’t think you’re worth it.

I can see that.

Hell, what kind of friend would I be if I couldn’t? 

...

\[resigned\] 

But I’m going to fix it- fix you. You just have to let me. 

I’m going to prove to you that you’re worth caring for. I have been trying for so long with all of these small gestures, hoping that you’d learn, but it’s never been enough. 

This is the only thing I could think of. You left me no other choice. 

...

We were friends. But friends can make their own decisions because they know when to put themselves first. 

You don’t. You never have. 

...

\[more upbeat\]

And that’s why you’re not just going to be my friend anymore- you’re going to be my pet, my puppy. I even got a little bow to tie around your neck for Christmas! It’ll be cute, I promise. 

Annnnd, well, I don’t want to ruin the surprise for any of your presents but I’ll have something a little more… substantial than a bow for you to unwrap on Christmas morning. 

...

\[earnest\]

I know you’ll love it- because I know you. I know your style, I know what you like. I am the only one who knows you like this- the only one capable of caring for you like this. 

...

\[serious\]

You need someone who will prioritize you- you’ve proven time and time again that you can’t, or won’t, do it yourself. 

...

\[insistent\] 

And you don’t have to worry about being selfish- this is for me too! I brought it up before, but when I started working from home, you were so worried that I would get lonely. You tried to talk me into getting a pet so that I wouldn’t be by myself all day. You lectured me nonstop on the importance of companionship. 

But the more I thought about it the more I realized that there’s really only one person’s companionship that I ever really wanted. 

...

\[almost pleading\]

Oh, don’t look at me like that. Please, pet. You should be excited! You always complain that I never take your advice and while this might not have been exactly what you had in mind when you said that I should get myself a puppy…

Well, I mean… you offered to go to the shelter to help me pick one out, but I think this counts, right? 

You went on and on about how important it was to adopt a rescue and I simply can’t imagine a pet more in need of saving. 

...

\[calming\]

This is going to be good. For both of us. I promise. 

You can trust me. 

You always have, and I have never let you down. I’m not going to start now.

I know this is all really overwhelming, but once you adjust, you’ll see. We are going to have the most relaxing and carefree holiday. We can watch old movies, play music, and I have all the best Christmas treats for my precious puppy.  

...

\[sfx: listener struggling a little\]

...

\[pleading\]

Please, don’t try to argue with me. You know I hate saying no to you. 

I can’t let you talk right now because hearing you beg me to let you go- knowing that you would run right back to everyone that hurts you… I think hearing that would break me. Please. I can’t. 

...

\[soft\]

I just can’t, okay?  

Oh, no, no, no, please, don’t cry. Pet, please. I… Can I hold you? Will you let me do that? 

…

\[calming/disappointed\]

No, shhh, shhh, okay, I understand. I’m sorry. It’s okay. I’m not going to touch you. You’re okay. Please, you don’t need to shake your head like that, I hear you. 

...

\[hurt\]

God, that whimper. 

...

\[brokenhearted\]

And you still look so scared. 

Okay, I can see you’re going to need some time. I'm… I’m going to leave you alone for a bit so you can have some time to think about all this. 

...

\[quiet\] 

Just… please. Don’t pull at your restraints- you’re not getting loose from those cuffs but I don’t want you to hurt yourself trying. 

I’ll be back to check on you soon.

 ...

\[sfx: footsteps\]

...

\[hesitating\]

I hate to leave you like this, pet. I know I’m scaring you and you need some time to calm down, and I wish there was a better way to comfort you, but I know this is what you need. 

It’ll be okay. Everything is going to be okay. Just take some deep breaths. I won’t leave you for too long, I promise.

1ph0x7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeatherInInk/comments/1ph0x7k/one_thousand_seven_hundred_and_seventyfirst_night/,One Thousand Seven Hundred And Seventy-First Night,"Today was busy. We had another snow storm, not as overwhelming as before but certainly a steady onslaught, and the first thing I did today, before even making a coffee, was go out to refill the bird feeders. For some reason I was ready and rearing to do all my chores in record time. I watered all the plants, did the laundry, a little decorating, wrapped the gifts that arrived today, made soup with the new crock pot, and even got a little writing down. Emphasis being on 'little.' 341 words is far from my best and far from where I am normally satisfied. Still that being said, considering all the other things I had to get done today, the fact that I wrote at all is a victory. The eighth chapter is off to a slow but decent start.

I would like to be more satisfied with all that I got done today but in some areas it is really just a matter quantity over quality. It turns out I do not like crock pots. Or at least I don't like making my potato soup in them. It took forever to cook and turned out thinner than I'd like. I also added too much butter but that is not the crock pots fault. I left the potatoes in there as long as it would take them to soften on the stove and not only were they hard as rocks, even on the highest temperature, the broth was so cool that I could dip my hand in without flinching if I wanted. It did heat up with time but as it turns out, I don't want it to take so much time. Maybe I just don't like making my recipe in the crock pot. Maybe I'll try making something else in it. Not anytime soon, though.

Most of the gifts I bought are hear aside from the CD and the seeds. At the moment the only thing under the tree is what I've wrapped. Father wants me to go to the mall with him tomorrow to help him find his own gift for mother plus pick out my own gift. The last time we were there I saw a tweed jacket I really liked. I would prefer it to be a surprise but beggars can't be choosers I suppose. I also would rather stay home to catch up on my writing but I'll still go out with him. Help him find a gift for mother. Maybe I can just make him a list of things I'll be interested in and he can look around while I am elsewhere.

Anyway, I am going to relax for a while. I think I've gotten enough done today to deserve a break. Maybe I'll write a little more tonight. No promises, of course.

Yours & Mine,

S.O. Skinner

1ph0vii,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ph0vii/nervous_about_upcoming_date_help/,"Nervous about upcoming date, help!"," I have recently been thrown into the dating scene by a family member who is setting me up on a blind date. I (24F) have never had a boyfriend in my life, never kissed, never held hands, never even flirted with a guy. Ever since this guy got my number (about a week ago), we have been texting every day. We send giant block text to each other, and I limit it to 1 text a day. I’m afraid that if we text too much, there won't be anything to talk about on the date.



So far, he seems like a nice guy. He loves the outdoors, and we have similar music tastes, and he seems very down-to-earth. 



If I’m being honest, I have wanted to be in a relationship for as long as I can remember. I couldn’t wait to have a special person in my life to share memories with. The only problem is I’ve never met anyone I wanted to be with. I have never met a man and thought, “I want us to be a couple”. I’ve had men ask me out; some were even good friends of mine. 



The problem is that I am a little bit asexual. I don’t want to sleep with a guy too soon into the relationship, and a lot of men don’t like that. I’m serious, I’ve had guys do a complete 180 and never talk to me again. It makes me feel like I’m only worth getting to know if I’m willing to sleep with the guy. I want to get to know you as a person before we do anything serious. I don’t think that’s too much to ask for, yet it’s a constant roadblock.

I’ve only ever been on 3 dates in my life, and after each one, I thought “I have no interest in this guy in the slightest”. In my defense, my first date was in high school, and we both mutually didn’t like each other in that way (we became good friends after).  My second date was with a guy whom I met in college, and he was a narcissist. He told me that he doesn’t need to go to class because he already knows all the material, he said when he writes an essay it doesn't need revising because he writes it perfectly the first time, he told me that he would be miserable if he had to live in a small town (this was after I told him I lived in a small town my whole life and loved it), and told me all his classmates aren’t as smart as him. He then ended the date by opening his laptop and doing homework in silence until my ride came (I thanked him for the date, he mumbled bye without even looking at me). My most recent date was with a guy who spent the whole time explaining things to me. He, unprompted, explained credit cards to me (after I told him I know how they work), then told me how he is, in fact, in credit card debt. Oh, but don’t worry, he said he could get out of it anytime he wanted to… (so I guess he is willingly in debt?). He would also interrupt me a lot. I was talking about a project I did, and then he whips out his phone and starts showing me what stuff he built. I asked him many questions about his interests, but he only asked me maybe 2 questions the whole 5-HOUR date, and it was just so he could segway into his own story. I love hearing people talk about their passion, but it’s nice to be listened to about my own now and again.



I have only ever had dates that I knew with 100% certainty that I didn’t want to go any further. After each date, I get this depressing feeling that there is something wrong with me. I know this is normal. I know a lot of people struggle to find a partner; it’s just a really defeated feeling. Especially when everyone around you is in a happy, healthy relationship, and all they ever want to talk about is why I’m single or if I’m talking to anyone. Part of me wants this date to work out just so that I don’t have these kinds of questions anymore or so that I don’t have to worry about people trying to set me up with someone.



The scariest part about this blind date is what if I don’t dislike him? What if he makes a good impression? What if he likes me and I like him? My brain can’t fathom it happening because it’s never happened in my entire life. I wouldn’t know what to do.



With this being said, I have a little bit of faith in my upcoming date, and I don’t know why. It’s probably not going to turn into anything serious, but I think he will be a better conversationalist than my past dates (fingers crossed), and I’m hoping he is a gentleman.



I just hope that if he is someone I want to go on a second date with, that he feels the same way (and not because he wants to get in my pants lol). I know this is really cheesy, but I want a guy who has manners. I want a guy who opens doors for me and pays for me on a date. I really only go on coffee dates, and I don’t mind paying for my own drink, but it would be nice to have a guy pay for me without hesitation. Especially if he’s the one asking me out. Is that asking for too much?



I guess I’m just curious, because I have never gotten that far in my dating history. Do people go on second dates with a person because they feel a connection, or because they’re giving the person a chance?



How soon into meeting someone did you get that “I want to date this person” feeling? What did it feel like?



If you know you don’t want to continue seeing him, do you tell him in person at the end of the date? Would a text afterwards be rude? What do you say?



Any advice for my blind date? Any questions I should ask him? Wish me luck!!



TL;DR I have had a few bad dates, and I'm nervous about an upcoming date. Asking if people have any advice for dating, or specifically for my blind date.",1,1765161101.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Part I: Discovery

The first time the anomaly appeared on sonar, no one thought much of it.

The Argo Deep was three weeks into its six-week survey of the Cascadia Abyssal Plain, and most of what they mapped was as monotonous as the desert — empty seafloor, gently undulating, with the occasional black smoker vent or jagged scar where tectonic plates had disagreed long before men learned to draw maps. The crew had grown used to staring at the same sets of blips and grids on the monitors. Sometimes they joked about it — how they were the most overeducated cartographers in the world, drawing the ocean’s bones one ping at a time.

But then the sonar technician, Alvarez, frowned.

It was a small thing. He had been half-asleep over the console, sipping his third cup of burnt coffee, when the sweep returned a cluster of reflections that didn’t belong.

“Dr. Keene,” he called over his shoulder. His voice carried easily in the quiet control room. “Can you take a look at this?”

Dr. Sarah Keene, chief oceanographer, leaned over. She had spent her career in deep-sea geology, her patience worn to diamond-hard tolerance by years of squinting at irregularities only to find out they were noise, or shadows, or boulders dropped from icebergs centuries ago. But Alvarez’s tone had a thread of unease in it, and she followed his gaze.

On the grid, a shape stood where nothing should. Rising from the flatness of the plain, almost vertical. Too smooth, too regular.

“Depth?” she asked.

“Just shy of seven thousand meters,” Alvarez said. His eyes flicked to her, the corners tight. “No trench nearby. No ridge.”

Keene studied the return. The object wasn’t massive by seafloor standards — maybe thirty meters high, if the readings weren’t distorted — but its angles bothered her. Not jagged like rock. Not amorphous like coral. Sharp. Deliberate.

“Probably an error,” she said at last, though even she didn’t believe it.

Still, she logged the coordinates.


---

By morning, the anomaly had become the thing everyone whispered about.

The Argo Deep carried a mixed crew: scientists, engineers, submersible pilots, a skeleton staff of Navy observers whose funding had quietly greased the expedition. They’d seen enough oddities to know most mysteries shrank under scrutiny, but boredom was a powerful fuel for rumor.

At breakfast, the pilots speculated whether it might be a shipwreck. Alvarez swore it was too big. One of the Navy men suggested it could be Cold War debris, some long-forgotten satellite or weapons platform dumped into the black.

Keene said nothing. She only watched the numbers.


---

That evening, the captain gave her the go-ahead.

“Send one of the drones,” he said, folding his arms as if bracing for disappointment. “Clear it up before the crew gets carried away.”

Keene agreed. She wanted answers too.

The ROV — Heron II — was lowered after dark, its lights slicing into the churning surface before it vanished into the endless descent. Everyone crowded the control room to watch the feed.

Five hundred meters down, blue still lingered. At a thousand, the light turned to murk. At three thousand, black swallowed everything but the drone’s beams.

The deeper it went, the quieter the room grew.

At six thousand meters, Keene felt her throat tighten. The drone’s altimeter ticked closer to the seafloor. She leaned forward, waiting.

“Contact in one hundred meters,” Alvarez said softly.

The cameras cut through the dark, showing swirls of silt, slow-drifting pelagic creatures, an occasional pale fish darting from the beams.

Then the ground appeared. Flat, rippling, empty — until something vast loomed in the distance.

Not a rock. Not a wreck.

It rose from the plain, impossible in its symmetry. A column at first glance, but as the drone approached, the truth sharpened into focus:

A face.

A face larger than the submersible itself, carved in cold stone. The eyes were hollow, gaping. The mouth hung open in a silent scream, its proportions wrong — too wide, too long, not meant for a human skull.

The crew stared in silence.

“My God,” whispered Alvarez.

Keene’s pulse thundered in her ears. The camera tilted, revealing shoulders buried in silt, a torso half-swallowed by the plain. It wasn’t just a face. It was a statue.

And no one could explain how it had come to rest nearly seven kilometers beneath the waves.




Part II: Descent

The debate lasted less than twelve hours.

Captain Morrow wanted nothing to do with it. He had signed on to ferry scientists, not to flirt with the abyss. The Navy observers were split — one cautious, one eager to claim whatever prize lay waiting on the seafloor. Keene herself pressed hardest.

“We can’t leave it unexplored,” she argued in the wardroom, standing with her palms flat against the chart table. “If this is man-made, it’s the most significant archaeological discovery of the century. No civilization on record had the technology to build at that depth. It rewrites—”

“It kills,” Morrow interrupted. His voice was flat, graveled with too many years at sea. “If something goes wrong, there’s no rescue. Not at seven thousand meters.”

Keene met his gaze. Her heart beat hard, but she didn’t look away. “That’s why we have the Scylla. She was built for this. Titanium hull, full redundancy. If we don’t dive, someone else will, and they won’t have our equipment. Or our care.”

The room fell quiet.

Finally, Lieutenant Hale — the younger Navy man, all square jaw and ambition — leaned forward. “One dive. Minimal crew. Document the site. If it’s nothing, we’re done.”

Morrow muttered something under his breath, but he didn’t argue further.

And so it was decided.


---

The Scylla waited in her cradle, gleaming under floodlights, a steel sphere built for three. Her viewports were narrow, her arms delicate, her body designed to withstand pressure that would crush most submarines to powder.

Keene would go. Alvarez, despite his nerves, volunteered to pilot — he trusted machines more than men. The third seat was filled by Lieutenant Hale, who refused to let the civilians dive without military oversight.

They launched at dawn. The sea was calm, the kind of surface stillness that always made Keene uneasy — as if the ocean, for once, was pretending to sleep.

The descent began smoothly. Numbers scrolled across the consoles, depth ticking steadily downward.

A thousand meters. The light drained away. Keene pressed her face to the viewport, watching jellyfish pulse like lanterns, their bodies ghost-pale in the dark.

Three thousand. Fish with unblinking eyes drifted past, silent as thoughts. The water grew thicker, blacker, a weight pressing from all sides.

Five thousand. Hale had stopped speaking, his earlier bravado stripped away by the immensity outside. Only Alvarez muttered occasionally, coaxing the sub, whispering like a priest at a shrine.

Six thousand, six hundred.

Keene’s breath fogged the glass. She was trying to steady her heartbeat when the seafloor appeared — an endless gray plain, dusted with silt, lifeless. And then, rising from it, the idol.


---

Up close, it dwarfed them.

The statue’s head alone was the size of the Scylla. Its features were almost human, but stretched and distorted, as though sculpted by someone who had only heard of mankind, never seen it. The eyes were vast pits. The nose was flattened, the mouth open wide enough for the submersible to glide into, if they dared.

“Christ,” Hale whispered.

Keene could barely hear him. Her own thoughts clamored, disbelieving. The material looked like stone, but smoother, darker, as if time and pressure had polished it. Carvings ran along the visible torso — spirals, notches, grooves that made no sense to the eye, as though written in an alphabet meant for something else entirely.

Alvarez angled the floodlights higher. The beams struck the hollow eyes, and for a moment it seemed as though the idol stared back.

Keene shuddered. She told herself it was only imagination, but the sensation lingered — an awareness pressing against her skin, as though something vast and waiting had noticed them.

“Get closer,” she said, her voice steadier than she felt.

Alvarez maneuvered the sub forward. The arms extended, brushing silt from the carvings. The grooves were deep, purposeful. Even after centuries, they had not eroded.

“Take samples,” Hale ordered, his tone clipped, as if speaking too loudly might wake it.

The manipulator scraped a fragment loose. The sound — a screech of metal against stone — reverberated through the hull. Keene winced. The shard clattered into the sample bin, dull and heavy.

Alvarez swore softly. “This isn’t natural,” he said. “It’s not basalt, not any formation I’ve seen.”

Keene leaned closer to the viewport, eyes drawn inexorably to the idol’s mouth. Inside the dark hollow, patterns glistened faintly, as though wet. For a moment, she thought she saw movement — a ripple, a shiver deeper within.

“Pull back,” she whispered.

But Alvarez’s hands hesitated on the controls. His eyes were wide, glassy. Hale noticed and snapped, “I said pull back!”

The sub lurched as Alvarez obeyed, backing away from the idol’s face. Keene tore her gaze from the mouth, her skin crawling.

They ascended in silence.


---

Back aboard the Argo Deep, the crew swarmed them with questions. What had they seen? What was it made of? How could it exist?

Keene answered what she could, though each word felt inadequate. She kept her eyes on the fragment Alvarez had retrieved, now sealed in a container on the lab bench. It was heavier than it should be, almost metallic, its surface etched with spirals too fine to have been cut by ancient tools.

When she touched the glass, her fingers tingled.

That night, when she finally collapsed into her bunk, sleep did not come easily. And when it did, it brought her dreams of hollow eyes staring from the dark, and a voice whispering through fathoms of water — words she did not understand, but which seemed to understand her.




Part III: The Idol

The fragment sat sealed in its container, but no one wanted to be near it.

By protocol, Keene logged it, labeled it, and placed it in the ship’s geology lab. But even through the thick plexiglass of the sample case, the shard drew attention. Crew passing through the lab would glance at it and then look away quickly, as if they’d stared too long at a body on the roadside.

It was darker than stone should be — almost black, yet it caught the light strangely, as though it swallowed it and reflected it back in patterns too complex for the eye to follow. Fine etchings ran across its surface, spirals within spirals, lines that seemed to shift when Keene wasn’t looking directly at them.

By the second day, she noticed people avoiding the lab altogether.


---

That night, the dreams began.

Keene woke gasping, drenched in sweat, certain that water had been pouring into her cabin. She’d dreamed of corridors flooding, bulkheads groaning, the ship sinking with impossible speed. But what lingered most was the face. That vast, hollow-eyed face staring at her through the dream.

At breakfast, Alvarez looked haggard. “You too?” he asked quietly, when the others weren’t listening.

She nodded.

“I dreamt…” He trailed off, his hands tightening around his mug. “It was down here. On the ship. Standing in the corridor. Too big to fit, but it was there. Watching.”

Before Keene could reply, Hale slid into the seat across from them. He hadn’t slept either — his uniform was rumpled, his eyes bloodshot.

“Whatever it is,” he muttered, “we should drop it back where it came from. Before it decides it wants more than dreams.”

Alvarez flinched. “You don’t think it’s—”

“I don’t know what it is,” Hale cut in sharply. “But I know I don’t want it here.”


---

The lab equipment disagreed with him.

On the third day, Keene ran density tests on the fragment. The readings came back inconsistent — not impossible, but off enough that she reran them. The second set contradicted the first. So did the third. The numbers seemed to shift, as though the shard were changing under her instruments.

When she tried spectroscopy, the machine flickered, screens glitching before returning only static. Alvarez checked the circuits twice; nothing was wrong.

“Like it doesn’t want to be measured,” he said softly.

Keene didn’t reply, but she thought of the eyes. The way they had seemed to follow her, even in the crushing dark.


---

By the end of the week, the ship felt different.

Conversations stopped when Keene entered a room. People spoke in low voices, as if afraid of being overheard. Meals were quicker, laughter gone. Even Captain Morrow walked with shoulders hunched, as if weighed down by invisible chains.

Every night, the dreams grew worse. Some woke to the sound of knocking at their doors. Others swore they heard whispers in the ventilation shafts, words garbled but urgent. Hale startled awake one morning with his bunkmate shaking him, after he’d begun speaking in a language no one recognized.

And through it all, the fragment remained in its case, untouched. Waiting.


---

On the eighth day, Keene found Alvarez staring at the sample. He hadn’t noticed her enter. His face was pale, drawn, eyes fixed on the spirals that writhed faintly across the black surface.

“Alvarez,” she said carefully.

He blinked, as though surfacing from deep water. His lips parted. “It’s not carved.”

“What?”

He pointed. “The lines. They’re not carved. They’re growing. Changing. Look—”

Keene leaned closer. Her skin crawled. The grooves were not static; they shifted subtly, curling into new configurations, as though something alive inside the stone was pressing against the surface.

Her stomach lurched. She backed away.

“Seal the lab,” she ordered.

But as she turned, she saw Hale standing in the doorway. He had heard everything.

And the look in his eyes told her what she feared most: he had already decided the only way to end this was to put the Scylla back in the water — and return the fragment to the idol’s waiting mouth.




Part IV: Influence

The Argo Deep had always been a quiet ship, but now the silence turned poisonous.

The crew avoided one another in the corridors. Meals were eaten quickly, in tense solitude, trays abandoned half-full. Even the hum of the engines seemed subdued, as if the ship itself had grown cautious, unwilling to draw attention.

Keene caught fragments of conversations — whispers about the fragment, mutters about omens. One sailor crossed himself when she passed, muttering under his breath. Another asked outright if she had “brought it aboard on purpose.”

It was superstition, yes. But it was spreading.


---

The dreams worsened.

Keene woke one night to find water trickling down her bunk wall. She sat up, heart hammering, and touched it. Dry. When she looked again, the rivulets were gone.

Alvarez stopped sleeping altogether. His hands shook, and his eyes darted constantly, as if searching for something just beyond the edge of vision. He confessed to her in a whisper that he’d begun hearing voices on the comm systems — static resolving into words, speaking in the same alien spirals etched into the fragment.

“It wants us back,” he said hoarsely. “It’s calling us.”

Keene wanted to dismiss it. But she had heard whispers too. Sometimes in the pipes, sometimes in the sea itself — the faint, distorted sound of someone calling her name from miles away.


---

The first accident happened on the tenth day.

One of the junior engineers was found in the machine shop, standing stock-still with a length of steel gripped in both hands. When spoken to, he didn’t respond. His lips moved soundlessly, whispering patterns in the same cadence as Alvarez’s comms.

When Hale reached for him, the man swung the steel bar without hesitation. It took three others to restrain him. He clawed and screamed until they sedated him, shouting about “eyes in the dark” and “the mouth that waits.”

The crew quarantined him in the infirmary. After that, no one wanted to pass the lab, not even to fetch supplies. The fragment lay alone, but its influence seeped through bulkheads and rivets, filling the ship like ballast.


---

Two nights later, Keene woke to a faint sound in her cabin.

Knocking.

Three taps, slow and deliberate, on the inside of her porthole.

She froze, staring at the blackness outside the glass. They were seven kilometers above the seafloor. No diver, no fish could be there. And yet — knock. Knock. Knock.

Her body moved before her mind did. She slammed the porthole cover shut and pressed her back against the wall, shaking until dawn.


---

Captain Morrow convened an emergency meeting. His voice was brittle, his face hollow.

“This ends now,” he said. “We’re jettisoning the sample. Seal it in a container and drop it overboard.”

Keene felt a flash of relief — until she saw Hale’s expression. The lieutenant’s jaw was tight, his knuckles white.

“You can’t just throw it away,” he snapped. “That thing is worth more than this entire ship. We don’t destroy discoveries. We study them.”

“It’s not your decision,” Morrow shot back. “I’m master of this vessel. And I won’t let it sink under us.”

The two men glared at each other, silence thick as oil. Finally, Hale rose.

“You’ll regret this,” he said. Then he left without saluting.


---

That night, the lab alarms tripped.

Keene was first to arrive. The containment case stood open, its glass lid shattered. The fragment was gone.

For one dreadful moment she thought it had moved on its own. But the truth came quickly: footprints in the scattered glass, leading out the door.

Hale.

She found him in the hangar, already suited up, prepping the Scylla. The fragment was cradled against his chest in a heavy-duty sample pod. His face was pale, but his eyes burned.

“It belongs down there,” he told her, voice eerily calm. “You know it does. It’s not meant for the surface.”

Keene tried to reason with him. She begged. But when Alvarez arrived, Hale only barked, “Either you’re with me, or you’ll get out of my way.”

Before they could stop him, the Scylla was in the water again.

Descending.

Carrying the fragment home.



Part V: The Awakening 

Hale

The Scylla sank into blackness, and Hale’s breath fogged the glass.

He should have been afraid. Seven thousand meters down was a death sentence if anything failed. But instead he felt exhilarated — as though something vast and benevolent had turned its gaze upon him.

The pod lay strapped to the seat beside him. Through its tiny viewport, the fragment pulsed faintly, spirals writhing like living veins. Each twist of its surface whispered in his mind, guiding his hands on the controls.

He no longer thought of himself as a trespasser. He was a messenger. A servant.

Depth ticked down: 4,000… 5,000… 6,000 meters.

And then, through the forward viewport, the seafloor bloomed into view. Flat, endless. Silent.

Until the idol rose from it like a mountain.

The hollow eyes burned in his mind. The mouth yawned wide, waiting.

Hale smiled.

“I’ve brought it back,” he whispered. “I’ve brought it home.”


---

Keene

On the Argo Deep, the control room was packed. Every eye fixed on the monitors, where Hale’s descent streamed back in eerie clarity.

Keene’s nails dug into her palms. “Cut the feed. Recall him,” she ordered.

“We can’t,” Alvarez murmured, his face waxen. “He’s locked out the uplink. It’s one-way only.”

Static fuzzed across the speakers. Beneath it came Hale’s voice, soft but certain: It’s waiting for me. Can’t you hear it?

Morrow cursed and slammed a fist against the console. “Idiot’s gonna kill himself.”

Keene shook her head slowly. “Not just himself.”

The sub drew closer to the idol. Its head filled the screen, stone mouth gaping like a cavern. The grooves along its surface shifted faintly under the floodlights, curling and uncurling in spirals that made Keene’s stomach churn.

She forced herself to look away — but others didn’t. She saw Alvarez staring too long, lips moving as if mouthing the unseen script. A petty officer slumped to the floor, whispering nonsense syllables.

The influence was bleeding through the feed itself.

Keene lunged and snapped the monitors off.

Half the crew jolted awake, gasping like drowning men.

But the damage was done.


---

Hale

The idol’s face filled his viewport.

Closer now. Close enough that he could see details not visible before: the carvings were not grooves, but openings, thin slits from which the blackness seemed to breathe. Faint streams of silt poured outward, but against all logic they carried a rhythm, like exhalations.

The fragment pulsed harder in its pod, vibrations rattling the bolts. Hale unlatched it without hesitation. He cradled it in his hands, feeling its warmth seep through the gloves.

“Here,” he whispered. “Yours.”

The mouth loomed.

He guided the Scylla forward, toward the darkness inside.


---

Keene

Klaxons wailed across the ship.

“Pressure spike in the hangar!” someone shouted.

Keene ran, heart hammering. When she reached the bay, the water gauges screamed red. Tiny rivulets spilled from the seams.

Then the lights flickered, and she heard it — a hollow boom reverberating through the hull, like something vast and heavy shifting on the ocean floor.

The idol had moved.

It was not just stone.


---

Hale

Inside the mouth, the dark was not empty.

The walls glistened, slick as flesh, lined with spirals that throbbed like veins. His floodlights caught glimpses of movement — folds contracting, something vast inhaling.

The fragment in his arms dissolved like salt, sinking into the walls, absorbed.

The statue shuddered.

And then it opened its eyes.


---

Keene

The control room went dark.

Monitors filled with static, then a single image: two hollow eyes, burning through the feed as though looking straight into the Argo Deep.

All around her, crew collapsed screaming. Some clawed at their eyes. Others simply went still, whispering in voices not their own.

Keene clutched the console, forcing herself not to look, not to listen — but the sound seeped in anyway, a voice speaking in spirals, promising that the sea would take them all.

And beneath it came another sound, deeper, older:

The sound of something rising.




Part VI Reclaiming 

The ship’s alarms screamed, metallic voices drowned beneath the roar of the sea. On the bridge, Keene clung to the console as the floor pitched under her boots. The sonar screens should have been a storm of lines and numbers, but instead they pulsed with eyes — hundreds, thousands, unblinking, layered one over another until the glass was nothing but white sclera and black pupils. They stared without depth, without mercy.

Alvarez swore and slammed a fist against the nearest panel, but it didn’t clear. He backed away until his shoulders hit the wall, his face bathed in the glow of the impossible screens.

“He’s inside it,” he whispered. His voice was child-thin. “Hale went inside.”

Keene shut her eyes, just for a second, but it didn’t help. The eyes were burned there, behind her lids.

The deck shuddered, not from waves but from something deeper — like the sea floor itself was shifting. Outside the bridge windows, black water bulged upward, glassy and wrong. Bubbles rose the size of houses. The ship listed, metal shrieking as if protesting.

“It’s coming up,” Keene said hoarsely. She pointed — and there it was.

The idol’s crown broke the surface first, jagged with barnacles. The carved eyes glowed faintly, the same unbearable light as on the screens. But the rest of it followed: shoulders broader than city blocks, arms half-buried in sediment. The sea poured off it in cataracts, thunder rolling as if a mountain had decided to rise.

The idol was not a statue.

Stone flexed. Runes ran like liquid, flowing in channels down its torso. The mouth yawned, the abyss behind Hale’s final descent gaping wide, and from within came a sound — not roar, not voice, but a rush of suction like the inhalation of a god.

The ship was dragged forward, pulled as if hooked. Consoles sparked. Men screamed on the decks below. Keene clutched the railing until her knuckles split.

The sea fractured around them, a funnel of water opening downward. Not to the trench they had mapped, but to something older. A throat. An endless passage.

Alvarez broke first. He tore free of his frozen lean against the wall and bolted, his rasping cry vanishing into the corridor. Keene staggered after him, but stopped at the bridge’s threshold, staring down into the spiraling water.

“Do you see it?” She whispered, no one around to hear. “Christ, it’s not the bottom. It never had one.”

The idol bent lower. Its hand — carved but not rock, fingers thicker than the ship’s hull — reached out with impossible slowness. The ocean did not resist it. The sky dimmed as if sun and moon both were shamed into hiding.

The ship lurched. The idol’s hand closed.

For an instant Keene thought she saw Hale again, framed in the glow of the idol’s mouth, his silhouette waving like a shadow on a wall. Then the pressure crushed the bridge, glass shattered inward, and black water roared in.

She had no time to scream. Only the eyes filled her, one final time.

The sea swallowed the Argo Deep. When the waves stilled again, there was no sign it had ever existed. 

The abyss had reclaimed all.

1ph0td3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/comments/1ph0td3/a_coffee_break_article/,A Coffee Break Article,"Coffee is Not Just A Pick Me Up

For centuries, coffee and tea have been more than just comforting daily rituals—they have been prized for their powerful health benefits. Modern research now confirms what many cultures have long believed: when enjoyed mindfully, both beverages can significantly support physical health, mental clarity, and emotional well-being.

# 1. Rich in Antioxidants

Both coffee and tea are loaded with antioxidants, which help protect the body from oxidative stress and free radical damage. These antioxidants play a vital role in reducing inflammation, supporting immune function, and lowering the risk of chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.

* **Coffee** is one of the highest sources of antioxidants in the average Western diet.
* **Tea**, especially green and white varieties, contains powerful polyphenols like catechins that support cellular health and slow aging.

# 2. Supports Brain Health and Focus

Caffeine, found naturally in both coffee and tea, enhances alertness, concentration, and cognitive performance. Unlike energy drinks, these beverages provide a more stable energy boost without extreme spikes or crashes.

* Coffee is linked to improved memory, reaction time, and mental stamina.
* Tea contains L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes calm focus, helping reduce anxiety while maintaining alertness.

Regular consumption has also been associated with a reduced risk of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

# 3. Boosts Mood and Emotional Well-Being

Both coffee and tea stimulate the release of feel-good neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. This helps elevate mood, reduce feelings of depression, and create a greater sense of motivation and enjoyment. The ritual itself—pausing for a warm drink—also encourages mindfulness and stress reduction.

# 4. Supports Heart and Metabolic Health

Moderate intake of coffee and tea has been linked to:

* Improved circulation and blood vessel function
* Lower risk of stroke and heart disease
* Better blood sugar regulation
* Enhanced fat metabolism and weight management

Green tea, in particular, is widely studied for its role in supporting healthy metabolism.

# 5. Promotes Longevity and Disease Prevention

Studies show that people who regularly drink coffee or tea tend to live longer and have lower rates of several chronic diseases. The anti-inflammatory and protective compounds work together to support long-term vitality and overall resilience.

**A Note on Balance**

While coffee and tea offer impressive benefits, moderation is key. Excessive caffeine can lead to anxiety, sleep disruption, and digestive discomfort. Most health experts recommend **2–4 cups per day** as a safe and beneficial range, depending on individual sensitivity.

**Final Thoughts**

Coffee and tea do far more than wake us up—they nourish the body, sharpen the mind, uplift the spirit, and support long-term health. When enjoyed with intention and balance, they become powerful allies in a holistic wellness lifestyle.

My journey is over.

Every speaker was tested both inside and outside.

The [outside environment was the park next to me in the football area at different distances](https://i.imgur.com/vHKaHzD.jpeg).  
The[ inside was on my 80kg wooden coffee table listening to it from the kitchen](https://i.imgur.com/PNpBaC5.jpeg) (what I consider a realistic scenario basically).

So [proof ](https://i.imgur.com/uRfAezu.png)of purchase for the losers, [proof](https://i.imgur.com/NBB8pGP.png) of purchase for the winner because otherwise people call me a liar or ""poor because I didn't actually buy them"" which is odd because a refund costs nothing? 🤷

It's important to note that I listen to **EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN** from Brahms to Super Mario 64 Bombomb Battlefield soundtrack. My Spotify wrapped told me I ""listened to 284 genres"" and, yeah. Most likely. So if your thing is a specific genre, then obviously my parkour and tastes will be different than yours.

I also never tried W-King or Zealot. W-King Boombox felt a bit too heavy to bring on trips (7.2kg) and Zealot... honestly it looks fine but I just didn't bother as it felt like a middle-of-the-road brand.

Marshalls look like they only produce speakers that blast forward too which is not a good use case for me.

Here's my trip through speaker purgatory:

**The Rejects:**

**Bose SoundLink Max** – The overwhelming bass can be tamed with EQ and it's honestly a very pleasant portable speaker but the parasitic battery drain is unforgivable. Watching a speaker bleed power while sitting idle is infuriating. I was losing 20% every 4-5 days and it seems to be a common thing. Dealbreaker.

I recall seeing some men in the forums say the handle is emasculating. Unsure what this is about, it's a fine comfortable handle but maybe I don't have the fragility of a teenage boy.

**Tribit Stormbox Blast 2** – I was genuinely excited for this one. Seriously you can see it through my post history and damn was I happy to test it when I got it. More ""fun"" sounding than its predecessor, better bass, improved light show. But here's the thing: it only sounds acceptable on bassy genres (EDM, trap, dubstep).

Anything else like rock, acoustic or classical sounds like hot garbage. If you listen to varied genres, hard pass. Also the X-3D mode is awful. Unusable.

I also did not read the weight before ordering and that was kind of a surprise. Coming in at over 7kg it's a bit meh to lug around in the outdoors.

I was extremely bummed out by what they did to the sound.

**Sony ULT Field 7** – This one hurt. I bought it *twice* because it sounds phenomenal indoors. Beautiful, full sound. But outdoors? The sound disperses way too aggressively. For a speaker this size and price, I need it to perform outside. Couldn't justify it. Also the app was absurdly bad. It actually ticked me off using it.

**EarFun UBoom X** – Massively overhyped. I don't know what copium the UBoom evangelists are huffing but this thing punches exactly at its price tag. No more, no less. Oluv's magic EQs didn't change that for me. Hope he got a fat paycheck from EarFun for that bribe. ""Sounds just like JBL Boombox 3"" my ass.

**Soundcore Boom 2 Plus** – Actually really impressive. Punches above its price for sound quality and the build quality/design is *exceptional*. It looks like plastic and it is but it's the kind of plastic that survives a hand grenade. The strap is dead silent, fast USB-C charging means I can top it up with a the same powerbank as I have for my phone, it floats speaker-side up (gurgled audio but at least you're not fishing it out of the lake and you know when it falls) and the app is the best speaker app I've ever used. If I was still in my 20s on a budget, I'd have kept this. Soundcore, please make a premium boombox lineup.

If it weren't for a ""more budget sound than JBL/Sony"" this would be N.1 easily. The amount of QoL useful stuff they packed into this speaker is astounding.

**Tribit Stormbox Blast** – Decent in all aspects and priced really well. I honestly get why people like it. But it could not handle sub-bass heavy tracks. [This track at 0:45](https://youtu.be/_W3OT22EF2A?t=45) made it squeal like a pig. Returned. To be noted this happens on Blast 2 but just way less.

**JBL Xtreme 4** – Perfectly fine unless you push bass past 60% volume where it kind of dies. So it was a ""skip"". Exceptional battery life and build quality though. I'm happy they started implementing swappable batteries here. Nice shoulder strap honestly.

**Sony ULT Field 5** – Too weak. Not bassy enough for what I wanted. Very expensive compared to an Ult Field 7.

**Soundcore Boom 2** – Honestly? If you want something portable that isn't a boombox, this is my recommendation. It clearly beats the Bose Max and Xtreme 4 for me. Factoring in the price, it's a no-brainer for anyone wanting something smaller. And yes the front grid looks a bit bad. But damn is this a killer package.

**The Winner: JBL Boombox 4**

Honestly I was nervous because of how horrendous it looked in pictures. Let's be super clear and honest here, it looks like a bad Chinese Knock Off of the JBL Boombox 3. It just does.

But it looks way better in-person. I don't know how to explain it but it's completely fine outside of the realm of pictures.

It's not perfect. Here are **my gripes**:

* **AC plug for $600?** Seriously expected USB-C charging at this price point. Ultra disappointing.
* **Latency is noticeable** if you're watching videos with wireless. Classic JBL honestly.
* **No shoulder strap hooks.** The Xtreme 4 has them. The *FUCKING* *Charge 6* has them. Why would you skip this on your heaviest speaker? ""WTF are you fucking stupid?""-level design choice. 3rd party straps look like ass and are often cutting massive corners in build quality.
* **Losing the 3.5mm jack**. Yeah I'm not very happy about it ngl. Granted don't have many 3.5mm devices but for that price tag... Wat?
* **That price tag.** Even I hesitated. Honestly if it wasn't the best speaker for me... yikes. We're approaching entry Macbook Air levels. For a bluetooth speaker.

**The Warnings:**

* **""Violent"" sound signature.** Vocals and instruments are EXTREMELY clear while bass is **VERY** powerful and can feel a tad strong. This creates a bit of a rollercoaster listening experience that can be fatiguing. I strongly feel this is only really an issue for the Indoors. Outdoors it sounds **incredible**. The bass boost will legitimately shake sturdy furniture. Not exaggerating. It's **perfect** **for me** that likes this kind of rumbustiousness but I can definitely 100% see this as a YMMV for many. Keep the receipt and 100% test it indoors and outdoors thoroughly.

**What's great:**

* **Premium feel and decent look** (IN PERSON ONLY - looks ***horrible*** in pictures) despite the plastic handle (more on that below because I don't see this as a con)
* **Handles dual Bluetooth connections flawlessly** \- I had issues with some speakers that say they do like massive latency or the need to reconnect
* **Absolutely ridiculous power.** No one can complain about volume. Unless you just want to complain. Approaching 100% volume indoors may deafen you.
* **They shaved off a full kilogram** while making it *more* powerful with *better* battery life. Genuinely impressive engineering. Big kudos.
* **Replaceable battery**! Yes! Thank you!
* **IP67 and floats** (kind of a requirement for me with my outdoor usage)
* **Can still play lossless** with no latency through USB C

About the metal handle: yeah, it's gone. But anyone complaining clearly never left their Boombox 3 in the sun. That metal handle would sear your skin in summer. Overall fuck that thing. It looked good but it was definitely only an indoors thing. Good riddance.

**TL;DR:** After 10+ speakers, the Boombox 4 is my endgame. Violent, powerful sound that excels outdoors. Flawed but nothing I can't live with. The search is finally over.

Side-note I did a similar thing for micro speakers where the Tribit StormBox Micro 2 was the **CLEAR** winner. Way clearer than the Boombox one.

I do not have a speaker that I use size-wise between the Micro 2 and the Boombox 4. I do not bother. I either take the Micro 2 or go ham with the Boombox 4.
