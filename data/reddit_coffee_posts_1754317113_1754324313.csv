I know very little about matcha, but I’m looking to gift my girlfriend a complete matcha setup and could really use some advice. I’m looking for recommendations (available online, in India) for:
	•	A good whisk, bowl (sorry if I’m butchering the terms) and other matcha essentials
	•	1–2 types of matcha

She already has a whisk but i am not sure about the quality as that was also a gift from her office. My budget is around ₹5000 (can increase if need be), and I’m open to any other suggestions for items that would make the gift extra special.

1mhhttu,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mhhttu/i_suffer_from_shortterm_memory_loss/,I Suffer from Short-Term Memory Loss.,"I suffer from short-term memory loss\*.\* No… not the kind where you go to bed one night and forget everything by morning. What I suffer from isn’t something you typically read about. It’s very… *normal*, at least. Just little things; the kind of forgetfulness you joke about. A lighter missing here, words stuck on the tip of my tongue. Sometimes I’d walk into a room and freeze, blankly stare at the walls.

We’ve all done that and we laugh it off, chalk it up to stress, blame it on lack of sleep, too much screen time maybe even a bit of burnout.

I told myself I was just burnt out. That I needed to eat a vegetable or two, drink more water, maybe stop running on caffeine and sarcasm. A weekend off would fix it. That’s what I thought.

It all started a couple of days ago… or was it months ago? Honestly, it might’ve been years. Maybe I’ve been dealing with it since childhood.

I say “childhood” like I remember it clearly, but the truth is... it’s patchy. Like looking at old photos where the faces are just a little too blurry, like they were smudged with a thumb. I remember the smell of something sweet; maybe pancakes? Or was that someone else's memory?

The weird part is, I never noticed how much I was forgetting until I started writing things down. Not journaling, not anything deep; just sticky notes. Grocery lists. Reminders to call someone I don’t even recognize now. I found a note yesterday that said, *“Don’t open the door.”* No explanation. *Just that.*

I laughed at first, figured it was some late-night paranoia, a dream I wanted to remember. But then I saw the same note in the bathroom. Same handwriting. Same words. Different paper. And I don’t remember putting it there.

*“Don’t open the door.”*

Was it a joke? A prank on myself? I do that sometimes…..leave odd little notes to break up the monotony. But this one didn’t feel playful. It felt… off. Like it had weight. Like it came from a version of me I didn’t remember being.

The more I think about it, the more I realize how many things I’ve been brushing off. Conversations I only half recall. People greeting me like we’ve met before and me, smiling, pretending I remember their face. Maybe I’m just tired. Maybe it’s burnout. *Maybe.*

There’s a moment in the day always sometime after dusk when everything feels... disjointed. Not wrong, exactly. Just a little misaligned. Like the world is one degree tilted from what it used to be. I catch myself staring at corners, trying to remember if the furniture has always been that way. I can’t tell if I moved it or if it moved itself.

And through it all, that same quiet question keeps circling in my head:

*What else have I forgotten?* Or is it something *I have choose not to remember?*

Work used to be the one place that grounded me. Same cubicle, same coffee machine, same passive-aggressive emails about fridge etiquette. It wasn’t exciting, but it was reliable. Predictable. At least, it used to be. I think that’s part of the problem; you never realize how easy it is to stop thinking when everything stays the same. I think my brain went on autopilot somewhere along the way. The routine became muscle memory: badge in, sit down, type things I don’t really read, nod at the right moments. Some days I’d look up and realize hours had passed without a single real thought. Just the soft hum of fluorescent lights and the click-clack of keys I don’t remember pressing.

Lately, things feel… off. People greet me twice in the same day, using the exact same words and tone, like a scene stuck on repeat. I get emails about meetings I don't remember scheduling. Sometimes I find myself sitting in on conference calls with people I don’t recognize; talking about projects I’ve apparently been “looped into.” They never seem surprised to see me. They nod when I speak, even though I have no idea what I’m talking about. I fake my way through it. Smile. Jot down notes I don't understand.

*And then there are the emails.*

I’ll read one in the morning short, boring, routine and then later that afternoon, I’ll go back to it and find it completely different. Same sender. Same subject line. But a different message. One said, “Meeting moved to 2 PM.” Later, it read: “What are you talking about?”

I flagged it. Asked the IT guy to look into it. He told me very politely that the email never changed. That there’s no record of any edits or strange activity on my account. He even asked if I’d been getting enough sleep. I always laugh when they ask that. It’s easier than saying, “I’m not sure who I am between 10 AM and noon most days.”

I found a file I don’t remember saving. Tucked inside a folder titled “Reference Materials,” it was a plain .txt document with no timestamp, no metadata, nothing. Just one line in a dull, monospaced font:

*“You’ve already done this.”*

I stared at it longer than I probably should have, expecting the sentence to change or blink or reveal more. But it didn’t. It just sat there.

Later that day, while waiting for the elevator, I met someone new. Her name tag said Marla, though I didn’t recall seeing her before and I’d been here long enough to know when someone was new. She had this oddly warm familiarity to her, like someone I’d once dreamed about and forgotten. The moment she spoke, it felt like we were picking up from a conversation we hadn’t finished. She teased me about the stain on my tie, asked if I still drank that bitter instant coffee from the break room, and giggled when I looked confused. I told her I didn’t remember us meeting. She just grinned.

“Still charming,” she said. “You never change.”

By lunch, we were already making plans for dinner. It felt easy. Too easy. She leaned in as we left the building and, half-laughing, half-serious, asked:

“What about the kids?”

I blinked. “What kids?”

She smiled, warm and glassy. “Don’t worry. I’ll handle it.”

I laughed, but an odd feeling twisted in my stomach. I didn’t have kids. Not really. Just my nephews, staying over for a few days while my sister was in town. She was with them now, at my house. The plan was movie night, frozen pizza, and lights out by ten. I hadn’t told anyone at work. Definitely not Marla.

*So, how the hell did she know?*

I told myself it was just a guess. A throwaway line. Maybe she assumed; everyone with graying temples and tired eyes has kids, right? That’s all it was. A shot in the dark. A lucky one.  
Still, the thought kept circling back, brushing against the base of my skull like static.

Back at my desk, I opened my messages. One unread. From Marla. No subject. Just one line again.

*“Don’t forget to pick up the orange juice.”*

I left work just as the sky turned that weak, dusty pink; the color of gum stuck beneath a school desk. The lot was mostly empty by then. I’d stayed longer than I needed to, replying to emails that didn’t really need replies, pretending not to hear the janitor humming somewhere down the corridor. I wasn’t avoiding home. Not exactly. Just... drawing out the space between things. Between Marla’s strange smile in the morning and the dull, constant thud that had settled in my stomach ever since.

The drive home was uneventful. A blur of red lights and gray cars. My street looked the same as always; quiet, suburban, harmless but quieter than it should have been. For a house with two boys inside, there was a kind of hush that didn't sit right. The kind that makes you hesitate at your own doorstep.

*I did. Just for a second*. Then I unlocked the door and walked in. The house felt colder than usual. Not cold in the physical sense; the thermostat blinked a steady 72 but cold like a room that hadn’t been lived in for a while. Cold like a waiting room after closing hours. Something about the air felt suspended. Like someone had hit pause and walked away.

“Guys?” I called out. “You here?”

No answer. No muffled feet rushing over carpet. No giggles. No fighting. Just... stillness. *And then the smell hit me*.

It wasn’t strong, at first. Barely there. A faint sourness, tucked behind the drywall. Like wet cardboard left to rot in a trunk. Something that had been damp too long. It trailed from the hallway into the kitchen. The walls seemed to hold it. The scent clung, not in the way of spills or messes, but in the way of things that had taken root. Things that had been forgotten. A note was stuck to the fridge. Just a plain slip of paper, damp around the edges, warped by moisture. The ink had bled just slightly, as if the words themselves didn’t want to stay put.

*Don’t forget to scrub the floor.*

Typed. No signature. No handwriting. I touched the paper. It felt soft. Wrong. Like it had been through the wash. I peeled it off, stared at it longer than I should have, then tossed it in the trash. Maybe my sister left it. Maybe the boys spilled something before they went out. Maybe a lot of things. I didn’t want to think about it too hard. I had plans tonight. A date.

I headed to the bedroom, expecting to grab my suit from the closet; the white one. Tailored just last Thursday. Crisp, clean, new. A reset. A way to be someone else for an evening. But it wasn’t in the closet. *It was on the bed.* Laid out carefully, sleeves outstretched like open arms. Like it was waiting for me. The fabric had been ruined. Stained deep and wide across the chest and down one side. Dried at the cuffs like old rust. I stared at it.

*Had I worn it already?* Maybe to dinner the night before?

But I couldn’t remember dinner. Couldn’t recall what I’d eaten. Or if I’d even been home. I blinked. My mouth felt dry. There was a dull hum building behind my ears. I picked a different outfit instead dark slacks, a button-down shirt. Safe. Unmemorable. *I’d deal with the suit later.*

The restaurant was warm. Familiar. Clinking glasses and low laughter filled the space. People brushed past one another with smiles and small talk. I found my table by the window, sat, and watched the traffic drift by like ghosts on the wet pavement. I checked my phone. No messages.

*Marla was late.*

I ordered water. Checked the time again. An hour passed. Then another. By the third, the waiter stopped asking if I was expecting someone. *She wasn’t coming.* So, I decided to just go home. I’ve never been stood up like this before. The drive back felt slower. There was no sense of urgency now; just a low pulse of unease. When I opened the door, the silence was waiting for me again. But so was the smell.

It was thicker this time. *Saturated*. Almost visible in the air. And no longer just sour.

There was a sweetness now too. Not the kind you want. Not sugar or fruit. More like overripe pears and pennies left on the tongue. Something metallic. Something that used to breathe. I stood in the hallway, keys still in hand. *The house didn’t feel like mine anymore.* And I hadn’t even started asking the right questions.

 

*What is that smell?* God, it’s strong, it’s everywhere, it’s in me. It’s crawling down my throat like something alive. It’s not just strong it’s itchy, like fiberglass in my lungs, like it’s trying to carve something out of me. It won’t stop. It’s gnawing yes, gnawing, that’s the word right at the back of my throat, like teeth made of rot. I can’t think, I can’t breathe. I need to find it. I need to know what it is. I need to tear this whole house apart if I have to. Right now. I need to find it. I need to find it now.

*I didn’t go to bed that night.*

I stood in the hallway for what felt like hours, staring at the closed attic hatch above me; the one I hadn’t opened in years. The smell was stronger now, sour and heavy, like meat gone wrong. Something sickly-sweet behind it, like rot layered over flowers. Eventually, I pulled the ladder down. Each rung groaned beneath my weight as I climbed. The air thickened the higher I got, dense and humid like the breath of something waiting. I pushed the hatch open with the flat of my palm, and the darkness inside greeted me with silence. I turned my phone’s flashlight on. The beam caught dust, insulation, cardboard boxes. And then further in the outline of a shoe. A small one. Blue. Velcro straps.

I froze. The light shook as I moved closer, illuminating tangled limbs. First my sister; her legs curled unnaturally beneath her; her hair stuck to her forehead. Then the boys, one slumped against her side, the other half-covered by a blanket, like they were tucked in for the night. Their skin had gone pale and slack, eyes half-open like they’d only just fallen asleep. I staggered back, hitting my head against a rafter. Everything tilted. My vision blurred. My knees gave out, and I sat there, gasping.

My first thought should’ve been to call someone; the police, an ambulance, anyone. But I didn’t. I couldn’t. Because something didn’t make sense. I remembered them eating cereal just two days ago. Cartoons on the TV. My sister folding laundry on the couch. And yet… I hadn’t heard them laugh in days. I hadn’t seen socks left on the floor, or cereal bowls in the sink. How long had they been up here? How long had I been down there pretending nothing was wrong?

I stumbled back down the ladder. My hands were shaking. I told myself I’d call; yes, I’d call the police but I needed to clean first. Needed to do something. Anything to make the smell stop pressing against my skin. I opened every window. Sprayed the hallway with whatever I could find. But the stench stayed thick in the walls. It was seeping through the house, *infecting it.*

When I came back with the bleach and gloves, I told myself I was preserving dignity. That I’d clean the space, then make the call. But I didn’t clean. I fetched the shovel.

The ground behind the shed was soft. We'd always joked about how it turned to mud after just a little rain. I dug until my back burned. Until my hands blistered. Until my shirt stuck to my ribs. Then I brought them down. *One at a time*. I kept telling myself I was going to call. Right after. Just after this one thing. *Just after.*

I went back inside to call the police. That was all I had left to do.

But the smell was unbearable now; rancid, cloying, like spoiled meat baked into the drywall. It hit me harder than before, stronger, like the house had been waiting for me to come back before it exhaled.

I lit a candle. Then another. *Then all of them*. Sickly vanilla and fake citrus mingled with the scent of rot, turning the house into a perfume bottle cracked open in a morgue. My eyes watered. I tasted copper in the back of my throat. I needed to get it out. The smell. The guilt. All of it. The note still hung crooked on the fridge.

*Don’t forget to scrub the floor.*

*They’re still here.*

I didn’t even remember seeing that second line before. My hands started to shake. I tore the note off and burned it over the stove. That’s when the doorbell rang.

It was *Marla*.

She smiled at me warm, glassy just like earlier in the office. She stepped inside like everything was normal. Didn’t even flinch at the stench that clung to the walls.

“Hey,” she said softly. “You okay?”

There was something off about her smile. Something that made my teeth ache.

“I—You shouldn’t be here,” I mumbled. “You… You weren’t supposed to know. About the boys. About the house.”

Her eyes narrowed. “What are you talking about?”

I stepped back. She stepped forward.

“Don’t worry,” she said, tone suddenly too sweet, too calm. “I’ll handle it.”

The same words. The *exact* words she’d said in the office.

Then she lunged.

She grabbed my wrist; hard. Her nails dug in. I tried to pull away but she was stronger than I remembered. Stronger than she should’ve been. Her voice twisted low and wrong, like it echoed from inside the walls.

I panicked.

I didn’t *mean* to hit her. But I did.

She hit the ground hard, her head landing against the edge of the hallway mirror. The frame cracked. Blood pooled quickly beneath her hair.

The smell grew stronger.

It was her.

The smell had been *her*.

God, what was she?

I wrapped her in an old bedsheet, took her to the yard, and buried her near the others. I couldn’t think straight. Couldn’t breathe in the house anymore. My vision blurred. My memory pulsed in fragments. A room full of candles. Blood on a suit. The boys laughing. My sister; no, not my sister. What sister?

I walked back into the house, trembling, phone in hand. Finally, I tapped 911 on the keypad. I was going to call. I *was*. It was over now. It had to be.

Then the knock came. Three short taps on the door. I opened it. Two police officers stood there. Their faces were unreadable.

And standing behind them… was *Marla*. Smiling. Whole. Alive. The boys were with her.

“Daddy!” one of them shouted. I stepped back. My throat dried. My chest tightened. The room spun. The taller officer cleared his throat.

“Sir, is everything okay? Your wife was concerned. Said she got some strange *messages* from you.”

*Wife?*

Marla stepped forward. She touched my arm.

“Honey,” she said, soft and confused, “what happened? Are you alright?”

I looked behind me, towards the hallway. There was no blood. No candles. *No more note*.

I blinked. Her voice felt distant rubbery and wrong, like sound traveling through water.  
“What’s that smell?” I asked. My throat still burned. It was still there thick and sour, clinging to the curtains, stuck behind my teeth. “You don’t smell that?”

“The” I paused, turned to the hallway. Nothing. No trail of blood. No candle wax, no broken lamp. No note.

“I saw—”

“You’ve been here all week. You haven’t left the house.”

That wasn’t true. I had gone out. I was at work. I had meetings.

“The boys…my sister was with them…in the house. I found them…in the attic. “

“The kids were with me at my Moms house”

I looked down at the boys. One of them held a half-eaten slice of pizza, sauce smeared across his face. The other sat cross-legged with a plastic spaceship, making whooshing sounds with his mouth.

I whispered, “Those notes I kept finding…”

 “You were texting me,” she said. “Some weird messages. They didn’t make sense. You just kept saying things like ‘They’re watching me. I found it. I remember now.’”

“You locked the doors,” she said. “You said someone was in the house. That the smell meant something. Then you stopped answering. I came to check on you.”

I turned in place, slowly, trying to see what she saw. No dirt under my nails. No freshly dug soil in the yard. Just the ticking of the *clock*, a greasy plate on the table, the warm hum of the fridge behind me. I looked down at my hands. *They were trembling*. Marla stepped closer and took them in hers.     

My wife told me; I suffer from short term memory loss but honestly;

*I don’t even know what to believe anymore.*",1,1754324116.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1mhhskf,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalitydisorders/comments/1mhhskf/i_think_i_might_have_bpd_instead_of_what_my/,I think I might have bpd instead of what my therapist thinks.. which sounds bad. but hear me out pls.,"Went to a therapist. Didn't bring up certain things because I was only going to therapy for one specific thing and just always thought therapy was kinda unnecessary in most cases. Seems like I'm wrong.

But. I told them I had a bunch of paranoia issues. Generic stuff. Others watching me, hidden cameras, someone being in the room listening in that i can't see but i can sense. Ect. (And on some level weirder ideas too and weird experiences that came off as hallucinations) which right now? Yeah it 100% was false.

but. I didn't mention being depressed or sometimes feeling like ending things or having issues with sometimes thinking others hated me and such. Yeah my mood is weird. Since quitting coffee its been more stable. (Was hyper for a couple weeks then felt sad for like 4 days. Gloomy. Sometimes dipping into very bad territory ) Quit coffee and that down time got extended into almost enough for clinical depression.

Its fine now though. I still get weird thoughts though like there being a hidden camera or that i was actually being drugged and such and i found some cbt stuff to help. It stopped making sense in my mind too.

However now i'm like... dang what if all that was actually bpd. Didn't go to a psychiatrist just a therapist who said they thought i had a psychosis related condition however bpd can have that too. Also the other day some stupid insignificant stuff happened and hey i just got super angry at everything and felt really really down. Felt over with anything. That reaction was overboard and idk why my mood was that extreme. Then sometimes i have a week or sometimes more where i only really feel happy. Fidgety. Can't physically feel sad even when I should. Worse sleep and stuff that sounds like hypomania almost but like i sleep ok so whatever. Rushed speech according to the therapist too.

Anyone else? Just thinking maye its just bpd cause like once or twice i was stressed, in an argument, and afterwards I had far more thoughts that hey theres something watching me, I'm actually not awake this isnt real, yeah maybe actually i need to be careful so others dont like know what i was thinking about. Then it goes away.

Also another time i realized I was anxious and as I was anxious i had more issues like that. calmed myself down and it stopped. I do have massive anxiety issues.

Finding dbt worksheets and will work with those.

Also, in the past.. not so much now cause I've worked through it I used to have issues with black and white thinking. I.e. this person isn't great cause they did that thus they cant be a good person! Oh no. I thought they were good but they did one little bad thing or one opinion i dont like so they're not good. (and this opinion was, like, really insignificant i dont even remember what it was.)",1,1754324038.0,personalitydisorders,0,1.0,False

Premise: Your girlfriend mentioned last night at some point she was craving a coffee. So, as a good boyfriend does, you snuck out early in the morning and not only acquired the coffee, but donuts as well. After all, she deserves the world.

Babe...? Is that you...? Gimmie five more minutes, pleeeeeease. 

(He kisses your forehead) 

It’s Sunday...? Oh, that’s right. 

What did we do last night? We just watched a movie, right? I can’t believe how little my brain works in the morning. 

 

You have something for me? What is it? 

(He pulls out a hot coffee and a breakfast sandwich) 

\*Quiet gasp\* 

You got me a coffee and sandwich?! Oh my gosh, you are just the best person everrrrr! 

 

Here, let me sit up. 

(You clumsily sit up in bed) 

Oof! \*Giggles\* Sorry, it’s still early, isn’t it? 

 

Well, you know me; not entirely a morning person, like yourself. 

When I said last night, I was craving a coffee and sandwich, you know I was half kidding, right? 

 

\*Giggles\* 

No no, I’m not complaining. This is \*deep inhale\* is exactly what the doctor ordered for me. 

Hot coffee, warm sandwich, slow Sunday morning with the best boyfriend in the entire world. 

Okay, well, maybe the doctor wouldn’t prescribe this because coffee’s bad for you blah blah blah. I know you don’t care I drink it, but only when I feel like I need a kick in the butt so early in the morning. 

 

But even without the breakfast in bed, just a slow morning with my man is all I really need. Is the coffee too hot still? 

 

No? Good, I’ll have a sip of that first please. 

(Sips the coffee) 

Mmmmmm... just the right temperature. I was worried it was going to burn my tongue off \*giggles\*. 

 

Here, switch with me; that sandwich looks amazing. \*Sandwich crunch sound\* 

 

(With a slight mouthful) Ahh! Bacon, egg and cheese! Oh, you are spoiling me right now, you know that? 

 

(You sit back in the pillow) People say you need millions of dollars to feel true happiness, but right now, I could die happy. 

 

Right? It really is about the simple and small things in life sometimes. I mean sure, money is nice, but those cozy moments can’t be truly replicated with money. Especially if you don’t have someone to enjoy these moments with. 

 

Get your butt back in bed with me. Pleeeeeeease...? 

 

(He sighs, takes his coat off and crawls back into bed. To which you immediately wrap yourself around him) 

 

Gotcha! \*Giggles\* Now you have to stay in bed with me until I’m ready to get up and I'm not ready yet. 

\*Shutters\* Is it real cold out? I mean it is early in the morning, but I figured the sun being bright would’ve given off a little heat. 

 

Well, you’ll warm up in no time. My superpower is getting toasty warm in the bed, so with my body wrapped around you, you’ll be warm in a jiffy! 

 

\*Exhale\* Hey, can I ask you something? 

Do you see us, doing stuff like this long into the future? I don’t know I just- While we’ve been together for a while now, I worry stuff like this, me being so unwilling to get out of bed might take its toll on you. 

 

I’m worried that my antics might annoy you after a while, or something. Maybe I’m over thinking it a little, but something tells me eventually, this won’t be cute or funny anymore. 

 

Awwww, you’ll always find them cute no matter what? Now you’re just catering to me, like a little princess \*giggles\* \*kiss\*. 

 

(You smother your face in his chest, smelling him) 

You smell so good... Sorry, I hope that isn’t weird either. I know I do it every night before bed. I’m just a little in my head this morning, I guess. I’m so used to the usual process. Anything outside of that is unknown territory. But I hope to be able to explore more stuff outside of my comfort zone with you. 

 

But for now, just let me lay my head on your chest, please. I promise I won’t fall back asleep, but I just want to take you in. Your scent, your warmth, your... presence. It’s so comforting. It always has been. 

 

Even just holding your hand is enough to steer my nerves and calm me down. 

 

This to me, is home. It doesn’t matter where we are or what we’re doing; if I can wake up with you and steal all your warmth, I will truly feel at home \*giggles\*. 

 

What’s on the agenda for today, anyway? Since it’s going to be cold, maybe it should just be a cleaning day for us. I need to organize the closet and move some clothes around. 

 

Oh, you were planning on cleaning the bathroom? You need help with that? Okay, that’ll give me a chance to organize and maybe vacuum all the rugs. It's been like two weeks since they were last cleaned. 

 

What do you want for dinner? We’ve got some chicken that we can thaw out, so it’ll most likely involve that. Just wing it? Psssst, you know me babe; I’ll do anything but that. 

 

Can I get another bite of the sandwich please? \*Cute chomp\* 

Mmmmmm, still so tasty. What possessed you to get up from this lovely warm bed and go out in the cold for coffee and sandwiches? 

 

Yes, I know I said I wanted one, but again I was kidding. We could’ve made some breakfast after we spent, oh I don’t know, at least an hour waking up and cuddling in bed. Too long? There is no such thing! Not when we have the comfiest bed in the world, and I have the cuddliest boyfriend in the world. 

 

Any updates on that interview babe? I know you said you were hoping to hear back from them soon. Nothing yet? That’s a shame; I’m hoping tomorrow you get an email or phone call. From how you described the new job opportunity, you really seemed to want it. 

And I mean that in the sense you were excited to finally be entering a field that you are amazing in. I don’t know anyone else in that career path, so it’s exciting to think you would be entering it. 

 

I’ll cross my fingers and my toes for you, don’t you worry. But in the meantime, let’s not dwell on it. If it happens, we will celebrate. And if not, there is always another opportunity around the corner. 

 

Yeah, exactly. I don’t want you stressing over this babe. Let the chips fall where they may. In the meantime, I think it’s about time we get our day started, no? 

 

I know, I know. We both could stay here all day and just cuddle, but we have some things we need to get accomplished. And the sooner we start, the sooner we can come back and lay in bed, or even just on the couch. 

 

Come on, babe. Let's get this Sunday started. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

Short and sweet. A simple premise that we have all experienced in regards to not wanting to get out of bed even though it’s insanely comfy.

1mhhrw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mhhrw9/can_the_presto_2822_coffee_percolator_deliver_the/,Can the Presto 2822 Coffee Percolator Deliver the Perfect Brew Every Morning Review?,"Testing out the **Presto 2822 Stainless-Steel Coffee Percolator** has been an adventure in my daily coffee routine. This coffee maker delivers a delightful balance of efficiency and performance, with just enough quirks to keep things interesting. For someone who craves that rich, classic coffee taste every morning, this 2-to-6 cup coffee percolator offers an old-school charm thanks to its manual functionality, paired with modern stainless-steel durability. Having relied on it for several weeks, I can confidently say it has its share of highlights as well as some areas where it could be improved.

**Classic Design Meets Modern Durability**  
As far as aesthetics go, this coffee percolator is a beauty. The stainless-steel exterior brings a timeless elegance to your kitchen countertop, while feeling sturdy and well-built in hand. At just 10 inches tall and 7.5 inches wide, it is compact enough to fit in smaller spaces, which is ideal for those of us with crowded cabinets or limited kitchen real estate. The cool-touch handle and knob are practical features, ensuring no accidental burns during hurried mornings. Even the detachable cord adds convenience by making storage a tad easier. That said, the cord length feels a bit on the short side, making counter placement slightly restrictive.  

**Ease of Use and Brewing Experience**  
Operating this percolator is as simple as it gets. The manual coffee brewing process isn't for everyone, but for those who enjoy hands-on involvement, it's a satisfying ritual. Listening to the soothing percolating sound alone is worth it—it feels nostalgic without compromising functionality. However, grind size plays a crucial role in the brewing quality. I learned (after a couple of messy overflows) that too coarse a grind or insufficient tamping can result in weak coffee, so careful adjustments are a must. 

**Highlights**  
- Brews a rich, flavorful cup of coffee.  
- Detachable cord enhances portability and storage.  
- Timeless stainless-steel finish complements all kitchen aesthetics.  

[Check Presto 2822 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b002lvuik8/)

**Performance and Keep-Warm Functionality**  
One aspect that won me over is its automatic keep-warm mode. Once the coffee finishes brewing, the percolator keeps the coffee at the perfect temperature without burning it—a significant plus for slow sippers like me. This feature pairs amazingly well with the machine’s drip-free spout, ensuring you can pour directly into your mug without finding puddles of coffee on the table. That said, I noticed it leans slightly slower in brewing compared to electric models, particularly at full 6-cup capacity.  

**Weaknesses**  
- Requires careful attention to grind size and coffee amount to avoid brewing mishaps.  
- The keep-warm function, while fantastic, doesn’t always maintain optimal heat for extended periods.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to other challengers like the Farberware Yosemite Percolator and the Cuisinart Classic Stainless-Steel Percolator, this product impresses with its simplicity and price-to-quality ratio. Farberware’s percolator tends to produce slightly hotter coffee, though it’s less compact and lacks a detachable cord, making storage cumbersome. The Cuisinart version, while faster and featuring a more modern interface, comes at a noticeably higher cost and veers into over-complication for those preferring simplicity. This is precisely where the Presto percolator carves its niche: straightforward performance with just enough convenience to make it loveable.  

**Price Performance**  
When weighing its features against the cost, the product proves to be an excellent bang for the buck. Many coffee makers in this price range either forgo aesthetics or compromise on durability. With this model, you’re not only saving money, but you’re also investing in a reliable companion that won’t suddenly fail on you after a few months. If you ask me, there’s immense value in its timeless design, dependable brewing quality, and user-friendly features.

I work at a coffee shop/bar chain and when I was hired I was told that if there’s any sign of an infestation at the place they will close the store for a day and call pest control so they can clean the whole thing and solve the issue. 

On my second day here I saw cockroaches along with other coworkers and I immediately complained about this and they only sent the maintenance guy who set up some traps and told us to clean better. Ever since then it’s just been getting worse. I see multiple cockroaches almost every day. 

Apparently a customer complained to a public company of some sort because they also saw one and an inspector came a week or 2 ago, saw multiple of them and did a report and whatnot. I’m not very sure what happened but since then the manager just did a “cleaning action plan” that we have to follow. When I told the inspector that the company did have a pest control system but they just didn’t send it she looked very confused. 

I’m genuinely considering quitting over this because I have a very bad phobia of bugs. My worst nightmare since I was a kid was to be stuck in a small room with bugs and now I have to deal with that every time I work. I’ve started imagining them crawling in my house lately.

I am dealing with issues for 15 years now, with my main digestive issues being a lot of gas and having to poop more than 2 times almost every day, depending on the amount of food I am eating. I am currently trying to restrict my diet to only foods that have zero reactivity on my tests, which means for 6 days, I am only consuming chicken breast and white rice with salt and olive oil. While the farting is a lot less, I feel very weak and on some of the recent days I had very loose stool (Bristol 5) and the olive oil is clearly visible in the bowl and on the toilet paper.

Even before I went on the current diet, I had issues with nutrient absorption. I would wake up in the morning, feeling my heartbeat in my legs and whenever I would just slightly bend my foot, I would get a cramp in my calve. When I still went to the gym and did some body pump workouts, I always got cramps when I got on my toes. On bad days, I even get cramps in my hands while sitting in front of a PC. I can easily supplement Magnesium to counteract that, but I need almost 2g over a day to get rid of the cramping consistently.

Quick facts:

* diagnosed with IMO via Lactulose breath test
* diagnosed with some food allergies via IgE-blood tests (mainly milk proteins, but some other also low to medium high)
* recent prick test with some foods and env allergens has shown zero reactivity
* IgG test shows same milk reactivity as IgE test, also shows medium reactivity to a lot of foods
* hormone and blood panel look fine, see my post history for values

Additional issues that might be relevant:

* my nose is kind of stuffed all the time, and I expected this to be caused by my non restrictive diet, but I still have trouble breathing through my nose on day 6 of my diet
* zero arousal from real sex / porn, but I can masturbate to completion mechanically and I do get morning wood
* shy bladder and very weak urine stream, confirmed by urologist with uroflow and urodynamics, my bladder can hold up to 1l of water and i get almost no urge to pee
* my sleep quality is pretty bad, and I have no idea how to further improve it. I am reducing screen time, I am optimizing dinner time but I always wake up exhausted and I have trouble falling asleep
* I am sweating a lot in humid or warm environments (whenever I am at a party, I am the guy that sweats the most for sure)
* I drank coffee for 15 years, but I am almost 3 months clean now

Timeline

* 2010: had vacation in Spain (Mallorca), started drinking coffee and first symptoms appeared shortly after, had no memorable food reaction to anything I ate there
* 2010-13 first testing for lactose intolerance which was confirmed as true, also first IgE tests showing reactivity to milk
* 2014: avoiding milk did not really cut it and I still had symptoms, doctor recommended hospitalization. They ran some checks, no celiac but they found yersinia in a stool sample. No treatment and a follow up stool test 2 weeks later did not find any yersinia
* 2012-2021 stopped consuming alcohol completely, no change

I am currently visiting a therapist for all the mentioned issues, I will get another GI Map and parasite test soon but I am slowly losing hope that I can go back to a normal life because all I can think about is my digestion and why my sexuality is not working as expected.

Designed specifically as replacement charcoal water filters for all Cuisinart coffee makers, I was initially skeptical about whether they’d live up to their promises. But after using them for a couple of months, I can confidently say they’ve enhanced my coffee experience significantly. With a unit count of 12 in one pack, these filters offer plenty of replacements, making it a hassle-free choice for long-term use.

**Ease of Installation and Universal Compatibility**

One thing I immediately appreciated is how easy it is to install these filters. You soak them in water for 15 minutes, then rinse under cold tap water for 30 seconds, and voilà—your Cuisinart coffee maker is good to go. They’re compatible with every Cuisinart coffee brewer, which is a fantastic benefit for someone like me who has an older model. I can’t stress enough the convenience of not having to hunt down special filters for older machines.  

[Check GoodCups Fridge Containers price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b08wrsh3h4/)

**Enhanced Flavor for the Perfect Brew**

Before trying these replacement filters, I never realized how much impurities like calcium, chlorine, or odors were affecting my coffee taste. After swapping out my old filter, the difference was night and day. The water tasted cleaner, and this directly translated to richer, fresher coffee. For someone who drinks two to three cups daily, the improvement in water quality has been an undeniable upgrade to my mornings. My coworker, who also owns a similar Cuisinart model, noticed the taste difference immediately during our office coffee rituals.

**Superior Filtration and Longevity**

The activated charcoal in these filters is incredibly efficient at removing impurities. I’ve run multiple tanks of water through one filter, and it continues to perform as well as it did on day one. Plus, knowing that this level of filtration is helping protect my coffee maker from buildup has been reassuring. The improved water flow design has also made clogging in my machine a thing of the past, which used to be an occasional nuisance.

**Environmentally Friendly Construction**

I appreciate sustainable products, so the fact that these filters are made from recyclable materials is a big plus for me. It’s nice to know that while I’m indulging in my coffee routine, I’m also making a choice that aligns with environmentally conscious practices. A small step, sure, but it’s important nonetheless.

**Overlooked Downsides**

While I’m thoroughly satisfied with the product, no product is perfect. Here are a couple of areas that could use improvement:  
- The filters require a 15-minute soaking process before installation, which can feel inconvenient if you forget and need coffee ASAP.  
- Packaging could be slightly more robust. A couple of filters in my pack were squished during shipping, though it didn’t hinder their performance.  

**Product Alternatives**

In comparison to third-party filters and original Cuisinart filters, these replacements stand out for their balance of affordability and quality. The original filters do deliver good filtration, but they cost significantly more—sometimes double the price. Other generic brands I’ve tried fell short in longevity, often lasting less than the promised two-month lifespan. None, so far, have managed to match the same level of water flow efficiency or robust filtration as these filters. That said, Brita water filters for coffee systems are another alternative worth mentioning, though they lack compatibility with Cuisinart.  

**Value for Money**

These filters are not the cheapest option out there, but their quality justifies the expense. Given their superior filtration, eco-friendly design, and universal compatibility, they offer remarkable value. You’re essentially paying a fair price for significantly cleaner water and better-tasting coffee, all while extending the life of your coffee maker. That feels like a win-win to me.

1mhhlp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBeautyCircle/comments/1mhhlp8/clean_perfume_for_sensitive_skin_professional/,Clean Perfume for Sensitive Skin: Professional Women's Guide Under $100,"You know that moment when you find the perfect fragrance, spray it on, and within an hour you're dealing with a headache that feels like someone's using your skull as a drum set? Yeah, I've been there too many times to count. As someone who's spent way too much money on perfumes that promised the world but delivered nothing but sneezing fits, I get the struggle of finding **clean perfumes that actually work** for sensitive skin.

Let me save you from the fragrance minefield I've navigated over the years. We're talking about scents that won't have your coworkers giving you side-eye in meetings or leave you reaching for antihistamines by lunch time.

# What Makes a Perfume ""Clean"" Anyway?

Here's the thing about clean perfumes – the term gets tossed around like confetti at a wedding, but what does it actually mean? **Clean fragrances focus on transparency in ingredients** and typically avoid the usual suspects that trigger sensitivity reactions.

Traditional perfumes often contain synthetic musks, phthalates, and other chemicals that can cause everything from headaches to skin irritation. Clean perfumes swap these out for safer alternatives or go completely natural. Think of it as the difference between eating a processed frozen dinner versus a home-cooked meal – both might fill you up, but one's clearly better for your body.

Most clean perfumes will proudly display what they **don't** contain:

* No phthalates
* No parabens
* No synthetic dyes
* No harsh alcohol bases
* No animal-derived ingredients

# Why Your Sensitive Skin Needs Special Attention

Ever wonder why some people can practically bathe in perfume while you can barely handle a single spritz? Your skin barrier might be more permeable, allowing irritants to penetrate deeper. Professional women especially deal with additional stressors – air conditioning, fluorescent lighting, and let's be honest, the general chaos of office life – that can make skin even more reactive.

**Sensitive skin requires gentler formulations** that won't trigger inflammation or allergic reactions. This means looking for perfumes with shorter ingredient lists, natural bases, and alcohol-free formulations when possible.

# Top Clean Perfume Ingredients to Look For

When I'm perfume hunting, I've learned to become a bit of an ingredient detective. Here are the **hero ingredients** I always look for:

# Natural Essential Oils

* **Bergamot**: Citrusy and uplifting without being overwhelming
* **Lavender**: Calming and universally well-tolerated
* **Vanilla**: Warm and comforting, rarely causes reactions
* **Sandalwood**: Sophisticated and gentle on sensitive skin

# Plant-Based Alcohol Alternatives

* **Organic cane alcohol**: Less drying than synthetic alternatives
* **Coconut-derived solvents**: Moisturizing base that's gentle on skin

# Botanical Extracts

* **Rose water**: Naturally anti-inflammatory
* **Chamomile**: Soothing and calming properties
* **Green tea**: Antioxidant-rich and gentle

# My Top Clean Perfume Picks Under $100

After testing more fragrances than any reasonable person should (my bathroom cabinet looks like a Sephora exploded), here are my tried-and-true favorites that won't break the bank or your skin barrier.

# Light & Fresh Options

[Herbivore Jasmine Body Oil ](https://amzn.to/4okZIDa)($48) This isn't technically a perfume, but hear me out. I use this as my signature scent when traditional perfumes feel too heavy. The jasmine is intoxicating without being cloying, and the coconut oil base actually nourishes your skin while you wear it. Perfect for those days when you want to smell amazing but your skin is feeling particularly cranky.

[Phlur Missing Person](https://amzn.to/4m3hGbZ) ($96) Okay, this one just squeaks under our budget, but it's worth every penny. The white tea and fig combo creates this clean, sophisticated scent that screams ""I have my life together"" even when you're running on three hours of sleep and gas station coffee.

# Warm & Sophisticated

For those days when you need a fragrance with a bit more presence in the boardroom, these deliver without overwhelming:

[Maison Louis Marie No.04 Bois de Balincourt ](https://amzn.to/450UhBP)($52) This sandalwood-based beauty has become my go-to for important meetings. It's warm and grounding without being too earthy. Plus, the longevity is impressive – I can still catch whiffs of it at the end of a long day.

[Clean Reserve Warm Cotton](https://amzn.to/47kq8yK) ($78) Despite the name suggesting it might be boring (cotton? really?), this fragrance is anything but. It's like wearing the most expensive cashmere sweater in scent form. The white musk is clean and comforting, perfect for sensitive skin types who usually have to avoid musk-based fragrances.

# Citrus & Energizing

Need something that won't compete with your morning coffee for attention? These citrus-forward options are perfect:

**Skylar Isle** ($78) This one reminds me of that vacation you desperately need but haven't taken yet. The coconut and citrus blend is fresh without being sharp, and the longevity surprised me – usually, citrus scents disappear faster than my motivation on Monday mornings.

# Application Tips for Sensitive Skin

Here's where I share some hard-earned wisdom from years of trial and error (emphasis on the error part):

# Pulse Point Strategy

Instead of spraying directly on your skin, try the **fabric method**. Spray your perfume on your clothes about 6 inches away from the fabric. This gives you the scent without direct skin contact, reducing irritation risk.

# The Hair Trick

Your hair holds fragrance beautifully and is less likely to react negatively. Spray perfume on your brush (not directly on hair – that can be drying) and then brush through. Just make sure you're using a clean brush – nobody wants yesterday's styling product mixing with today's signature scent.

# Less is Actually More

I know it's tempting to douse yourself when you find a fragrance you love, but with sensitive skin, **moderation is key**. Start with one spray and build up gradually. Your skin will thank you, and honestly, subtle fragrance is way more sophisticated anyway.

# Layering Technique

If you want more longevity without irritation, try layering with **unscented moisturizer**. Apply your moisturizer first, then your fragrance. The moisturizer creates a barrier while helping the scent last longer.

# Ingredients to Avoid Like Your Ex's Phone Calls

FYI, here are the ingredients that should make you run in the opposite direction:

* **Synthetic musks**: Major headache triggers
* **Alcohol denat**: Drying and irritating
* **Benzyl alcohol**: Despite the name, it's a preservative that can cause reactions
* **Limonene**: Found in citrus oils but can be sensitizing in high concentrations
* **Linalool**: Common allergen found in lavender and other florals

# Budget-Friendly Shopping Strategies

Let's be real – even under $100 can feel steep when you're building a fragrance wardrobe. Here are my money-saving tricks:

# Sample First, Buy Later

Most brands offer sample sets or discovery kits. Spend $20-30 on samples instead of gambling with full bottles. Your wallet and your skin will appreciate the trial run.

# Check the Milliliters

Don't just look at the price tag – check the size. A $60 perfume in a 50ml bottle is actually a better deal than a $45 perfume in a 30ml bottle. Math isn't my strong suit, but even I can figure that one out :)

# Subscribe and Save

Many clean beauty brands offer subscription discounts. If you find your holy grail scent, subscribing can save 15-20% on future purchases.

# Making Your Fragrance Last All Day

Nothing's more frustrating than spending good money on a perfume that disappears faster than free pizza in an office break room. Here's how to make your clean fragrance go the distance:

# Prep Your Skin

Apply an unscented, gentle moisturizer before your perfume. Hydrated skin holds fragrance longer than dry skin. Think of it as primer for your scent.

# Strategic Application Points

Apply to pulse points where your skin is warmest:

* Behind your ears (not on – behind)
* Base of your throat
* Inside your wrists
* Behind your knees (trust me on this one)

# The Vaseline Trick

Dab a tiny amount of petroleum jelly on your pulse points before applying perfume. It acts like a base coat, helping the fragrance cling to your skin longer. Just use it sparingly – we're going for sophisticated, not greasy.

# When to Reapply (And When Not To)

Here's something nobody talks about: **nose blindness**. After wearing a fragrance for a few hours, you stop smelling it, but that doesn't mean everyone else does. Before you reach for that second application, ask a trusted colleague if they can still detect your scent.

If you do need to reapply, stick to just one pulse point – usually the wrists work best for a midday refresh.

# Clean Perfume Myths Busted

Let me clear up some misconceptions I hear constantly:

**Myth**: Clean perfumes don't last as long as traditional fragrances. **Truth**: While some clean perfumes have lighter projection, many last just as long. The key is finding the right formulation for your skin chemistry.

**Myth**: Natural automatically means hypoallergenic. **Truth**: Natural ingredients can still trigger reactions. Essential oils, while natural, can be potent allergens for some people.

**Myth**: Clean perfumes are all light and boring. **Truth**: Have you smelled some of these woody, spicy clean fragrances? They pack serious personality.

# Building Your Clean Fragrance Wardrobe

You don't need a perfume collection that rivals a department store, but having options for different occasions makes sense. IMO, three fragrances cover most professional women's needs:

1. **Light daily scent** for regular office days
2. **Sophisticated option** for meetings and presentations
3. **Fresh backup** for gym days or when you need something barely-there

# The Final Nose

Finding the perfect clean perfume for sensitive skin doesn't have to feel like searching for a unicorn in a haystack. With the right knowledge about ingredients, application techniques, and realistic expectations, you can build a fragrance wardrobe that works with your skin, not against it.

Remember, the best perfume is one that makes **you** feel confident and comfortable. Whether that's a barely-there citrus scent or a warm vanilla that makes you feel like you're wrapped in cashmere, the right choice is the one that doesn't leave you reaching for tissues or Advil.

Your sensitive skin deserves fragrances that enhance your day, not complicate it. Here's to finding scents that make you feel like the boss you are – headache-free and fabulous. Now go forth and smell amazing, because life's too short for boring (or irritating) fragrances!",1,1754323611.0,TheBeautyCircle,0,1.0,False

just before sleep softens the world,

I mark spots on the road in my mind,

thinking, next time you visit, I’ll take you here,

if forgiveness could’ve found us

in time to mend what I broke,

if the ache we carried

might have softened into something whole again.


And Sometimes I wonder

do you still reach for your phone in the dark?

Do you ever feel the ghost of me

when you laugh alone?

Do you still find restaurants and ice cream shops

and think, we’d love this place?


But deep down,

I know you don’t.

I know your days are filled with someone new

someone who gives you

what you needed all along.

1mhhkd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Autism_Parenting/comments/1mhhkd3/traveling_at_airports_with_aspbergers_my_brothers/,Traveling at airports with Aspbergers: My brother's story at 40 years old,"My brother has Aspbergers, bipolar and depression and is 40 years old (he takes these medications every day: Haloperidol, Venlafaxine, Olanzapine and Lamotrigine). He still lives with my mom and stepdad, but my stepdad now lives in the basement because they broke up. I feel part of the reason is because my mom babies my brother, I feel awful saying he is a manchild.

I am an ambitious person who always pushes myself, so I try to help my brother in the same way. I gave him a part-time job at my small company doing simple tasks and he loves working from home on his laptop. He also has a part time job at a shopping center he works at one day a week (4 hour shift).

I am very lucky and privileged that my job allows me to travel for work. I always feel bad that my brother has never had the chance to travel on his own, so for his birthday, I invited him to come visit me in a big city and fly on his own, and come stay with me at my home so we can go sightseeing and he can explore what it means to be a ""tourist"" without mom around.

I thought he can go through the airport on his own, but it was very stressful to communicate every step of the way. I sent YouTube videos of the airport and very other step, from checking in on the Delta app, to finding your gate. I said I would pick him up from the airport. The plane had landed, he was left waiting at the gate, expecting me to come pick him up from the gate he landed at. I had to explain over the phone, he had to look for the Exit sign and leave the terminal to find baggage claim. That's where I was standing. 

Over the course of his trip on the next 4 days, I was able to see up close how excited he was to travel and see a new city. Even though he doesn't like posing in photos, I asked him to stand in front of certain monuments and he would smile and let me take the photos. He took over 150 photos of the city while traveling around. He said he didn't want to go home, he wanted to stay in this city because it is urban and fun. We would start the day having breakfast at home, then head out and see 3 things over the course of the day (monument, shopping, arcades, comedy shows, etc). All day, every day, he would talk, like narrating everything he was doing. For example: ""I'm now going to tie my shoes. Wait a minute, this is difficult with my backpack on, I'm going to take my backpack off and then tie up my shoes. There, that's better. Now the other shoe, hold on a minute."" It was very tiring by the end of each day. I would ask him to keep his internal monologue to himself, as I didn't need to hear everything. When we would take Ubers home at night after events (about a 20 minute drive), he would talk in a monolgue as well and I asked for quiet time in the car so I can read on my phone and catch up on messages. He said ""OK, I will stop talking, sorry I am talking too much."" Then, five minutes later, he would start talking again because he forgot that I asked him for quiet time in the car. He was also offended by this, asking if he did anything wrong. I said no, I just need some quiet time, I get tired at the end of the day. The next morning, he would still be worried if he did something wrong, like I wasn't telling him. I had to lift his spirits and say ""c'mon everything is fine, lets go outside and explore the city."" 

I didn't realize how forgetful my brother is, it was eye opening. I had to remind him to do basic things, like put on deodirant, brush his teeth, take his medication, take a daily shower. He lost things easily, like metro cards and museum tickets. I tried teaching him things around my home, like how to use my coffee machine or make a smoothie. On day one, he was very tuned in to understanding all the steps, but by the next morning, he forgot everything.

I booked the flight with Delta and contacted the [Accessible Travel Services](https://www.delta.com/us/en/accessible-travel-services/overview) hotline. There is also something called the [Hidden Disabilities Sunflower](https://hdsunflower.com/), which helps people in certain places (please check the list on their website, which says ""The Hidden Disabilities Sunflower is a simple tool for you to voluntarily share that you have a disability or condition that may not be immediately apparent – and that you may need a helping hand, understanding, or more time in shops, at work, on transport, or in public spaces.""). I told Delta's hotline my brother has Aspbergers and needs help on the plane ride home. 

I was supposed to fly home with him to visit my mom and stepdad but I was so energetically drained, I cancelled my flight the night before. I called and spoke to my stepdad and said, I'm sorry this is too much for me, I'm staying at home.

The morning of my brother's flight, Delta told me to go to the desk with the wheelchair in the background, they asked if he needed a wheelchair, I said no he needs help finding his gate and going through security. They scanned his QR code boarding pass and one attendant walked him through security, skipping the line, and took him to his gate. My brother sighed because all he wants to be is ""normal"" and gets mad at us (his family) when we do things that shows he has special needs. He was so mad at me for getting the Accessible Travel Services, he walked away from me without saying goodbye. Then, I got a series of text messages, like ""Don't worry I'm never coming back"" and then ""I know I'm a handful, sorry for all the mishaps"" and then ""Why are they asking me to board the plane on a wheelchair??"" My brother wants to be independent but I am unsure he has the capacity. I left the airport in tears, its just so much to handle.

1-Context

-I was a victim of sexual violence starting when I was 8 and it ended when I was 18. It affected me when it comes to intimacy. I'm through the worst of it. 
-the first person I told was my ex. It was very difficult for me to talk about it but I didn't want her to think something was wrong with her if I struggled with intimacy. We stayed together for 5 years but in the end the relationship felt more like a friendship because I struggled to be intimate with her. We broke up and decided to stay friends.

2- recently I met a girl about 1 year after our breakup. Let's call her Fanny. This time was very different because everything felt easy. We became intimate after a month, which has never happened to me. It felt surreal. I told her that I sometimes talk to my ex. She asked if I still had feelings for her, and I said no. It seemed to be fine, but sometimes she'd find stuff in my apt that was my ex's (like an old bottle of shampoo in a drawer) and I thought it made her sad so when I'd find things that were my ex's, I'd throw them away. I thought that was fine. We had been dating for almost 2 months.

3-Last friday I had coffee with my ex. I also felt I needed to talk to someone about fanny because I started feeling stressed about how to tell her about what happened to me. I did not want to screw things up by appearing like I'm a mess or something so I asked my ex how to tell fanny about my past. Since my ex is the only one I told, I didn't really have anyone else to talk to about this. She offered advice, I offered her advice for her new boyfriend and then that was that.

4-Yesterday

I told Fanny that I saw my ex for her birthday and that we had coffee. She instantly started crying and left. I was surprised by her reaction because I did tell her before that I still talk to my ex from time to time. To me, it's a very platonic relationship, and it was even when we were a couple. She said she does not want to ""compete"" against her, I tried to explain there's no competition but alas she left and said I broke her heart. We texted each other later, and I told her why I met with my ex. She did listen to what I had to say, but she said she needed a few days.

This was obviously the result of bad communication on each of our parts. Me not seeing that talking to my ex made her uneasy, and her not communicating boundaries.

5-now

I'm feeling very confused. I could stop talking to my ex, but that would mean losing a good friend. I did tell Fanny that I wanted to tell her about this stuff and not ask other people for advice. I also don't want to hide what I'm going through sometimes. I did feel it was too early in the relationship to talk about this, which is why I kept it from her and didn't tell her what I talked about with my ex. I'm just so unsure where to go from here. I do like Fanny a lot, but this whole situation has me confused.

Was asking my ex for advice ok? Is no more contact with my ex what I should do? Am I ok with Fanny leaving when something hurts her instead of talking about it and finding a solution? Do I wait for Fanny to text me or do I text her in a couple days? Any help in clarifying this would be greatly appreciated.

Finding daily work from home to be quite boring at times, and I'm hoping to find a few decent chatters to talk with regularly about really any topics of interest. I am from western Canada, currently work full-time from home with a fairly wide range of interests and really just looking to make some friends ideally around my age of 31. 

My top hobby at the moment is gaming, I play on PC, PlayStation and Switch 2 and mostly enjoy JRPGs and some co-op titles from time to time. A few examples: Persona 5 Royal, Sea of Stars, Chained Echoes, Dead by Daylight, Stardew Valley and Palworld, but my library is quite expansive and the backlog is ever building. I can stream some to you as well if we mesh while doing our own thing and chill after work.

My other interests are playing/listening to music (I play the piano mostly), movies, cooking and making tea or coffee, reading and watching videos on topics that spark my interest such as Chess, space, general science, history and such.

I am very easygoing but I would like to find a few friends who aren't just going to reply with one liners and place the entire onus of conversation onto me. It's not easy making friends these days, I get that there's social anxiety and other barriers but it really is a two-way thing and I can only respond with what you've given me and do so much to try to lead time after time. 

I'm not looking to chat for a bit then fizzle out into a random ""how are you"" every other week leading into silence, if it's clear we can't really have any conversation then that's okay I just don't want to waste anybody's time and really not my own either. It really is difficult to find kindred spirits these days with whom you can click and form friendships with, I don't mind taking the time or putting myself out there and I'm just asking for the same in return. There's no pressure to respond to me either, just whenever you can and want to is fine as obviously around this age we all have work and lives to attend to, not a big deal at all.

Soooo, I guess if there's anyone out there who are looking for the same thing, feel free to send me a message. If you do though, please do include some basic info about yourself, nothing deep or serious but if it's just a ""hi hru"" I mean, that's really tough to work with you know?

Personally Zoloft is great mentally, less anxious, no more ocd thoughts, depression is something of the past.... but oh my the acid refluxes.... I have been on it for a year now and I also take a ppi, dexilant, it doesnt even work. My chest hurts, my throat hurts, I cant drink coffee or enjoy the foods I like. Even a bland diet causes pain. It hurts from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. I used the daylio app to track symptoms and it seems I get 3-5 ""good"" days a month. To rate a day as ""good"" the pain needs to stay off my mind for most of the day so a ""good"" day doesnt mean it was a painfree day.... 

In the past I tried lexapro and celexa, both helped mentally , but they gave me the jitters and shortness of breath( no acid reflux though). So I switched to zoloft and all it did was trading side effects.... mentally, all ssri's helped so far, so I insist on trying prozac before trying another class of medication.

1mhhe2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/findomchatters/comments/1mhhe2d/food_and_child_palette/,Food and Child Palette,"This is a continuation of the debate about pineapple on pizza and the idea of having a “child palette.” I have a close friend with exactly that kind of palette, limited, familiar, and rooted deeply in comfort. Her food preferences rarely venture outside her zone of safety. She loves Mexican food because she grew up with it. She also enjoys Italian and Middle Eastern dishes. But when it comes to Asian cuisine, it is a hard pass for her. And I love Asian food. The variety, the spices, the fermented, the fresh, the umami—it’s a treasure trove. Luckily, we overlap on Mexican and Mediterranean, so we have a middle ground.

But here’s the recurring dilemma: whenever she suggests a meetup, she always picks Denny’s. Always. And I’ve been accommodating her choice for years—because I care, because I’m loyal, and because I get that it’s not just a diner to her.

She once told me that growing up, when her family went out on weekends, it was always to an American breakfast spot because that’s what they didn’t eat at home. Denny’s, to her, represents a slice of childhood joy. Pancakes, sausage links, and bottomless coffee meant celebration. It was tradition. And I respect that nostalgia. I really do.

But after years of compromise, I finally put my foot down.

I go to Denny’s, and I order the basics: bacon, eggs, toast, and hash browns. These are classic, but it is a pretty bland experience. There’s no spark, no flavor adventure. It’s reliable, but uninspired. Compare that to stepping into an Indian restaurant, where each bite is layered with cumin, turmeric, coriander, cardamom—ten different spices dancing together. Or sitting at a Korean table where ten tiny side dishes arrive: kimchi that bites back, sweet pickled radish, sesame spinach, spicy cucumber. Even a simple bowl of pho from a Vietnamese place carries the flavor of anise, cinnamon, ginger, charred onion all swirling in the broth.

When I told her I didn’t want to eat at Denny’s anymore, she pushed back, saying I spent a lot of money eating out and she didn’t understand why I was against a $15 meal that comes with coffee

So here’s how I framed it for her:

I’m not paying just to fill my stomach—I’m paying for flavor, experience, and craftsmanship. When I go out to eat, I want something I can’t or won’t make at home. Maybe I can cook it, but it’s a time-consuming dish with techniques or ingredients that require effort. That’s worth it to me. But everything at Denny’s—bacon, eggs, sausage, hash browns—I can whip up at home in fifteen minutes, and frankly, I can make it better. I don’t want to keep reminding someone to make my bacon crispy. 

I want to taste something new, surprising, bold—something that tells a story on my tongue. And that’s not what I get at Denny’s.",1,1754323169.0,findomchatters,0,1.0,False
1mhhe0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1mhhe0z/does_yonanas_fruit_soft_serve_maker_deliver_the/,Does Yonanas Fruit Soft Serve Maker Deliver the Best Vegan Dessert Experience Review?,"**Compact Design and Modern Appeal**

Using the Yonanas IC902ESV23 Fruit Soft Serve Maker every day feels like having a compact ice cream stand in my kitchen. The slim design, standing at just 13.75 inches tall, fits snugly next to my coffee maker without hogging countertop space. Its silver finish gives it a modern look, easily blending with stainless steel and plastic appliances I already own. It feels sturdy yet lightweight at 1.4 pounds, which makes storing it on a high shelf hassle-free. Surprisingly, even with all my clumsy handling, it hasn’t scratched or lost its elegance—a true win in the design department.  

**Simplicity at Its Best**

This frozen dessert maker doesn’t intimidate, even for someone like me who avoids complicated gadgets. I appreciate that the operation mode is fully automatic, yet the manual instructions are so clear, you feel in control the whole time. Slicing and freezing any fruit is about as technical as it gets. Bananas are a staple in my house, so tossing those in along with frozen mango chunks produced a sorbet so smooth, it could compete with store-bought options. It’s forgiving too—once, I tried using somewhat overripe berries, and it still spat out a treat that had my niece convinced it was “fancy restaurant-quality.”  

[Check Yonanas IC902ESV23 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b005083ecs/)

**Merits**

- User-friendly and quick dessert preparation.  
- Compact and sleek, adaptable to any kitchen.  
- Includes a recipe booklet, sparking creativity in dessert-making.  

**Performance Powerhouse**

The 200-watt motor deserves a standing ovation for its ability to churn frozen fruits into a creamy texture without overheating. During one chaotic weekend with relatives over, it whipped up about six servings back-to-back without hiccuping. The manual recommends keeping the machine off for a bit if overused, yet I never encountered such an issue, even with a mini dessert marathon. It’s perfect for me, considering I never plan ahead and often get inspired to whip something up on the spot.  

**Adverse Aspects**

- Slightly noisy during operation—makes you question your life choices if someone’s napping nearby.  
- Feeding small or overly firm frozen fruits requires a little force.  

**Easy Maintenance, Minimal Fuss**

Cleaning it isn’t my favorite aspect of owning kitchen tools, but this machine makes the process tolerable. All the removable parts are BPA-free and dishwasher-safe, which feels like a small blessing after creating multiple treats. To test it out, I handwashed a few parts and found it manageable, though some pieces like the chute did require extra scrubbing when sticky fruits were involved. A simple wipe with a damp cloth keeps the base spotless and ready to shine the next day.  

**Product Comparisons**

Comparing this model to similar soft serve makers on the market, I noticed it holds its ground against pricier options like the Ninja Creami or Cuisinart models. While those machines often offer larger capacities or multifunctional features, they also come with a steeper learning curve and bulkier size. The Yonanas maker, on the other hand, focuses purely on desserts, making it ideal for smaller families or casual snackers like me. I could argue that this soft serve maker’s simplicity outshines its competitors for people who value ease of use without breaking the bank.  

**Bang for the Buck**

Without directly diving into dollar values, this soft serve maker feels worth every penny for what it delivers. It has a niche appeal—vegan or dairy-free individuals who miss indulgent desserts will find it a delightful addition to their kitchen. Even for non-specialized diets, parents, in particular, will appreciate having a healthier way to satisfy kids’ sweet tooth cravings. Considering its efficient motor, decent capacity, and durable components, it aligns with mid-range kitchen gadgets that don’t just fall into the “trend gimmick” category, but provide lasting value.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **NPB Showdown: Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks vs. Chiba Lotte Marines – A Tale of Two Hitters (and One Very Serious Spreadsheet)**

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and anyone still awake on a Saturday morning: prepare for a *masterclass* in NPB prognostication! Today, we dissect the August 5 clash between the **Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks** (8-time champions, part-time superheroes) and the **Chiba Lotte Marines** (defenders of the “we’ll get ’em next year” ethos). Let’s parse the odds, sprinkle in some absurdity, and crown a winner before your coffee goes cold.

---

### 1. Parsing the Odds: Math Meets Mayhem

The bookmakers are throwing numbers like a toddler at a confetti factory:

* **H2H Odds**: Hawks at **-150** (implied probability: **60%**), Marines at **+200** (**33.3%**).
* **Spreads**: Hawks favored by **1.5 runs** (-150), Marines at +1.5 (**-200**).
* **Totals**: Under **6.5 runs** at **-110** (bookies whispering, “this’ll be a pitcher’s duel”).

Translation? The Hawks are the slightly favored “I-just-won-the-Lottery” team, while the Marines are the “we’ll-win-when-you’re-not-looking” underdogs. The spread suggests Fukuoka’s offense will likely eke out a narrow victory unless Chiba’s bats decide to launch a home run derby in the 9th inning.

---

### 2. News Digest: Injuries, Drama, and One Mysterious Squirrel

Unfortunately, the only “news” we have is the kind that comes from odds spreadsheets and the faint smell of recycled stadium popcorn. But let’s spice it up:

* **Hawks**: Rumors swirl that their ace pitcher, **Kazuki Zenzai**, has been spotted *meditating with a teacup* before games. Is it a zen ritual? A distraction? Either way, it works—his ERA this season is better than your dating app success rate.
* **Marines**: Their star slugger, **Shogo Nakamura**, allegedly tripped over his own shadow last week. Injuries? No. But if shadows can take a swing at NPB legends, what *can’t* happen?

Also, both teams’ managers are reportedly in a silent war over who can wear the most aggressively patterned ties. The 2025 NPB Fashion Police are *terrified*.

I've recently got back on the apps but opted for the ones with more limited likes to limit my time spent on them (Hinge and Coffee Meets Bagel). 

I've been job hunting since late 2022 for a job in my field but still can't find anything but I do have a part-time job. I feel like at my age, most women want a guy who is financially stable and doesn't live with their parents so I can't help but feel like I'm just wasting my time trying to find someone. 

I'm also unsure whether or not I should mention it on my profile since I like to be honest about myself and my situation because I feel like it serves to avoid misunderstandings, sets expectations, and makes it easier for women to make a decision to swipe on me.

1mhh4sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBrits/comments/1mhh4sb/if_your_physically_in_the_place_you_should_be/,If your physically in the place you should be priority,"So I'm noticing now a big trend in deliveroo orders taking priority over a busy cafe. 

Went into greggs today to get my coffee and the que was huge; there's 4 tills and 5 staff 1 person is serving us people there and the others were all at the side frantically packaging and delivery drivers there waiting. Not being funny but I think it rather stinks that deliveroo orders are slowly encroaching. 

One time I went into a subway I had already ordered and was eating and some dude comes in there were 3 staff on and he begins to order and the member of staff said sorry there's a 20 minute wait ... the customer literally looked around and theres just me in the corner he shrugged and waited. That staff member was spared that day because if that were me I'd of kicked off

I don't care that people order using whatever but there's something sacred about this for me 

like with the greggs today more staff were working on deliveroo when there's literally 10 people queuing am I wrong perhaps or do you agree that actually people in the stores should be served first?",1,1754322586.0,AskBrits,5,0.67,False
1mhh42v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mhh42v/ex_girlfriend_came_back_then_changed_her_mind/,"Ex girlfriend came back, then changed her mind again","My ex and I were together for two years. We were very much in love and everything went pretty much perfectly until she left for a summer abroad. I’m not much older but I did a lot early, so I had just finished college while she was starting it. As a result, we were living more like adults than college kids. When she spent the time away, she realized that she had been missing out on a bunch of “college stuff” and she broke up with me. It was devastating, and I couldn’t understand why we shouldn’t be able to figure things out.

I never initiated conversation after she got back and moved her stuff out of my apartment. All the same, she found a reason to text me once a month. After 6 months apart, she called me to tell me that she missed me, and asked if we could talk in a month when the semester started. We met for coffee and she said that when she had called me, she wanted to get back together, but now that she had had time to think about it, she had a gut feeling that it wasn’t the right time. Understandably, this was crushing. She talked about how badly she wanted to make things work but how it just didn’t feel right. I was cordial and understanding. After all, I want her to be happy, and I also want to be with someone who wants to be with me. All the same, I was crushed. It would be one thing if she just didn’t want to get back together, but SHE reached out to ME. 

We’re talking again in a few days and I just don’t know what to do. I don’t think she’s vindictive and I don’t believe she’s a bad person. This was a thoughtless thing to do but I don’t know what to think. She doesn’t want to ask me to wait for her but she thinks she’ll be ready eventually. I know my friends hate her for it and think I should cut her off but it doesn’t feel that simple.

It hurts so bad to know that we both want to be together but she just can’t do it for some reason. What can I possibly say to figure this out or untangle things? I don’t want to “convince” someone to date me but I can’t tell if she’s lost or confused or something else. I want to trust her judgment but I can’t understand what she wants or why she can’t make it work.

I know that people’s first reactions will be to assume that she’s a cruel person who is teasing me along for her own purposes. I hope that you can believe me when I say that anything she’s doing, she’s doing without malice.",2,1754322539.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Every time he went to bed he would go into a deep sleep and always dream about the same thing, it was him falling down a long hole. It was usually dark there but after a while the dark room became a spiral of colors. That's when they appeared. the thing Ryan hated the most: THE EYES, while he was falling he would see large eyes following him, the eyes came in all different sizes and when they blinked his head would start to hurt until it went dark. When he came to, he was falling in an infinitely long elevator shaft, the eyes were spray painted on the walls and had what looked like speech bubbles next to them, however he was coming down so fast he could never read them. After all of that he would usually wake up in a cold sweat. Ryan himself never knew what would happen if he never woke up. What would happen next? This always got him thinking, every time he fell asleep he would try
to get farther in his dream but most of the time he would wake up! However one day a most horrible accident did occur which allowed him to finally find out what happens if he stayed in his dream. On august 15 1987 Ryan was rushed into the emergency room, he had been in a horrible car crash. He was bruised,battered and the doctor did what they could to keep him alive.While all of this was happening Ryan dreamed he dreamed for a while in fact, because after falling down the elevator shaft in his dream normal he would wake up but not this time He kept falling. After what felt like an eternity the elevator shaft started shifting, changing into a large glass tube and the eyes were watching him from outside. They were not blinking though just looking right into his already frightened soul. HOURS WENT BY, DAYS WENT BY, AND THEN MONTHS WENT BY, he was still falling. About what felt like 5 months the glass tube changed again, now it was just blue sky no clouds however. ANOTHER 5 MONTHS went by. Ryan wanted to die but he could not. He was stu-that's when he saw it on the ground, it was coming fast “oh thank god” Ryan said, then…He woke up! He was in a hospital hooked up to machinery and tubes full of liquid. Ryan was in a coma for a year and to this day he has never had the same dream ever again. However, Ryan still feared he would have the same dream or worse go into another coma. He usually never went outside and tried his best to stay awake. He tried so hard in fact that he would drink tubs of coffee every day and bottles of energy drinks. In the year 1992 Ryan was found dead in his room, he had a heart attack after drinking 160 mg/L of caffeine",1,1754322525.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

Sorry for classical exemples but it's quite complicated to find activities other than War and Slaneesh's decadence.

Use your imagination to convert this for our sweet Primarchs.

* Chill date : simple activity, almost trivial but the romanticism makes it special (a walk, a coffee, a movie at the cinema...)
* Fancy date : some fun in a place made for the occasion (going to amusement park, a casino, a bar or a nightclub,...)
* Expensive date : spend as much money possible on the finest activities (an upscale restaurant, watching a performance at opera or arena, going shopping...)
* Outdoor date : enjoy healthy natural air before the Mechanicus comes here (a beach trip, a hike, going camping in a feral world, ...)
* Home date : have a romantic moment without moving (a movie in a bedroom, a romantic dinner made by the couple or a servitor, playing a game alone together, ...)
* Unexpected date : something so crazy and/or specific than it's quite impossible to predict (quality time in a unknown place except from you, an extreme/almost mortal activity, ...)

Sorry for classical exemples but it's quite complicated to find activities other than War and Slaneesh's decadence.

Use your imagination to convert this for our sweet Primarchs.

* Chill date : simple activity, almost trivial but the romanticism makes it special (a walk, a coffee, a movie at the cinema...)
* Fancy date : some fun in a place made for the occasion (going to amusement park, a casino, a bar or a nightclub,...)
* Expensive date : spend as much money possible on the finest activities (an upscale restaurant, watching a performance at opera or arena, going shopping...)
* Outdoor date : enjoy healthy natural air before the Mechanicus comes here (a beach trip, a hike, going camping in a feral world, ...)
* Home date : have a romantic moment without moving (a movie in a bedroom, a romantic dinner made by the couple or a servitor, playing a game alone together, ...)
* Unexpected date : something so crazy and/or specific than it's quite impossible to predict (quality time in a unknown place except from you, an extreme/almost mortal activity, ...)

1mhgzef,https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/1mhgzef/a_detailed_analysis_of_every_teams_last_waiver/,A detailed analysis of every team's last waiver claim,"Waiver claims. Always a fun part of the season, from Nashville hemorrhaging a variety of former top prospects to the snip-snap journey Raphael Lavoie took last year. But they’re underrated in importance - as we’ve seen in recent years, waiver claims such as Gustav Forsling and Michael Amadio can turn into key pieces of Cup-winning squads, and many former waiver-wire guys have gone on to become everyday roster players. With that in mind, let’s take a look at how every team’s most recent waiver claim has turned out with them! They’ll be judged on a simple line of good-meh-bad, based on their performance and other factors (ex. individual awards, trade returns if applicable, etc). Considering most waiver claims don’t turn out to be much, “meh” will be the standard, with “bad” only invoked if someone was actively terrible or had even less than minimal impact. “Good” has a wide berth, ranging from actively elite (ex. Forsling) to just simply solid (you’ll see).

*Disclaimer: As he hasn’t yet had the opportunity to play a game with them yet given he was only claimed a week ago, I’m not counting Nick Leddy for San Jose - this chart will only have guys who actually played at least one game with that team or in their org.*

|Team|Player|Date/Claimed from|Statline|Summary|Outcome|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|*Anaheim Ducks*|**James Reimer**|10/7/2024 from BUF|2 GP, 0-2-0, 4.50 GAA, .864 SV%|Reimer only appeared in two absolutely dreadful games for Anaheim, allowing nine goals across two losses as a temporary fill-in for an injured John Gibson. Reimer was subsequently re-waived upon Gibson’s return, appearing again later on this list.|**BAD**|
|*Boston Bruins*|**Oliver Wahlstrom**|12/14/2024 from NYI|16 GP, 1G, 1A, 2P, 28PIM|The former first-round pick had a fairly uneventful tenure with Boston, with only 16 games with the big club and 19 in the AHL. Didn’t do much, scored minimally, and is now a UFA.|**MEH**|
|*Buffalo Sabres*|**James Reimer**|11/13/2024 from ANA|22 GP, 10-8-2, 2.85 GAA, .901 SV%|Reimer’s second appearance on this list went a lot better than the first. After being reclaimed by Buffalo a month into the season, he served as the primary backup to Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen for the remainder of the season, posting a just-over-.500 record with numbers that honestly aren’t bad for a basement Sabres team. He remains a UFA, though.|**GOOD**|
|*Calgary Flames*|**Joel Hanley**|3/5/2024 from DAL|63 GP, 3G, 8A, 11P, 28PIM|Hanley has been a solid enough waiver claim for Calgary, starting a majority of the team’s games since he was grabbed from Dallas. He just signed a two-year extension at the start of free agency, which means that barring anything unexpected, the Flames will get just over three seasons from him. Not bad at all.|**GOOD**|
|*Carolina Hurricanes*|**Spencer Martin**|1/19/2024 from CBJ|15 GP, 7-5-2, 3.30 GAA, .869 SV%|After a brief but mediocre stint in 2023-24, Martin was actively horrendous in his appearances for the Canes this past season, posting a SV% south of .850 and a GAA of almost 4 on a defensively solid squad. However, he was rock-steady for the Canes’ AHL affiliate in Chicago, and ultimately leaves the team with a winning record over parts of 2 seasons, so not completely awful.|**MEH**|
|*Chicago Blackhawks*|**Zach Sanford**|1/6/2024 from ARI|18 GP, 0G, 4A, 4P, 2PIM|Not much to write about here. Sanford had a brief and unremarkable stint with the Hawks during the 2023-24 season, but was pretty solid for the AHL IceHogs over the last year. He’s currently a UFA.|**MEH**|
|*Colorado Avalanche*|**Kaapo Kähkönen**|10/11/2024 from WPG|1 GP, 0-1-0, 4.12 GAA, .800 SV%|A short and very bad tenure with the Avs, getting shelled in his lone big-league game; however, he was alright in a similarly brief tenure with the AHL Colorado Eagles. Like Reimer, he was waived again by Colorado, and will appear again on this list.|**BAD**|
|*Columbus Blue Jackets*|**Christian Fischer**|3/6/2025 from DET|1 GP, 0G, 0A, 0P, 0PIM|Fischer played just a single game with CBJ before retiring in the offseason to pursue a business opportunity in golf. Ouch!|**BAD**|
|*Dallas Stars*|**Marian Studenic**|2/24/2022 from NJD|19 GP, 1G, 2A, 3P, 6PIM|The longest drought without a waiver claim on this list, Dallas hasn’t made a waiver claim since midway through the 2021-22 season. Like others on this list, Studenic was unremarkable at the major-league level, but solid enough in the AHL, and now plays in Sweden.|**MEH**|
|*Detroit Red Wings*|**Magnus Hellberg**|11/23/2022 from SEA|17 GP, 4-8-1, 3.29 GAA, .885 SV%|Bad numbers on a bad Wings team in what was stop #4 in a whirlwind first two months for Hellberg. He was solid enough for AHL Grand Rapids, though, and not terribly bad for the Wings compared to some of the others on this list.|**MEH**|
|*Edmonton Oilers*|**Travis Dermott**|2/26/2025 from MIN|3 AHL GP, 1G, 0A, 1P, 0PIM|Important context that I’m only counting Dermott’s games after being re-claimed by Edmonton, so his 10 games before getting waived and leaving don’t count. Dermott did virtually nothing in his second go-around with Edmonton, playing only 3 games for the AHL Bakersfield Condors and recording just a single goal/point.|**BAD**|
|*Florida Panthers*|**Tobias Björnfot**|3/8/2024 from VGK|15 GP, 0G, 0A, 0P, 2PIM|As a Vegas fan, I often joke that Bjornfot is one of the players of all time, and he’s certainly been that with Florida. Though he’s done virtually nothing in 15 games with the Cats, he was something of a contributor to the AHL Charlotte Checkers, and he’s signed two extensions with Florida, so clearly they don’t mind having him around.|**MEH**|
|*Los Angeles Kings*|**Samuel Fagemo**|11/11/2023 from NSH|4 GP, 0G, 0A, 0P, 0PIM|Another re-claim, so his prior history with the team doesn’t count here. After losing him at the start of the 2023-24 season, the Kings grabbed their former second-round pick back in November 2023, where he played just four games with the big-league club before spending the entire 2024-25 season in the AHL. A classic quadruple-A player in baseball lingo, Fagemo was great with the Ontario Reign, but hasn’t been able to prove himself at the NHL level yet, and left the Kings a second time this offseason.|**MEH**|
|*Minnesota Wild*|**Vinnie Hinostroza**|2/5/2025 from NSH|25 GP, 5G, 3A, 8P, 4PIM; 1 playoff GP, 0G, 0A, 0P, 2PIM|The longtime journeyman made the seventh stop of his career this past season, posting a respectable 4th-line statline on a playoff-bound Wild squad. Dude even got a playoff game in, and should see more time next season as he’s still under contract for a year.|**GOOD**|
|*Montreal Canadiens*|**Colin White**|2/22/2024 from PIT|17 GP, 0G, 0A, 0P, 2PIM|The once-promising Sen’s fall from grace continued in Montreal, where he played well over a dozen games without recording so much as a secondary assist. With absolute minimal impact beyond simply being a warm body, this was a claim that didn’t pay off.|**BAD**|
|*Nashville Predators*|**Jakub Vrana/Jordan Oesterle**|3/6/2025 from WSH/BOS|13 GP, 2G, 1A, 3P, 4PIM; 15 GP, 3G, 1A, 4P, 2PIM|A double-listing, as both were claimed on the same day at the same time. Both posted *mostly* unimpressive statlines with Nashville, but considering the previous entry, it could’ve been worse. Oesterle’s three goals in 15 games is probably the most notable thing here; his career-high of six came in 71 games, and his 0.2 G/GP was by far the best of his career for the generally low-scoring defenseman, who’s under contract with Nashville for another year.|**MEH**|
|*New Jersey Devils*|**Nick DeSimone**|1/25/2024 from CGY|11 GP, 1G, 1A, 2P, 2PIM|DeSimone didn’t do a whole lot in his time with the Devils’ organization, splitting almost evenly between the NHL and AHL. Given that and the fact he appears later on this list as a departure from NJ, he was a certifiably unremarkable claim.|**MEH**|
|*New York Islanders*|**Adam Boqvist**|1/31/2025 from FLA|17 GP, 2G, 6A, 8P, 4PIM|The younger brother of Stanley Cup champion and former teammate Jesper, the former first round pick posted a fairly respectable statline for a defenseman in his nearly 20 games on the Island, and turned it into a one-year extension signed over a month before the opening of free agency. Not a bad pickup at all.|**GOOD**|
|*New York Rangers*|**Arthur Kaliyev**|1/6/2025 from LAK|14 GP, 3G, 1A, 4P, 2PIM|The semi-infamous second-round pick arrived in New York after his somewhat-shocking waiving from the Kings, and needless to say, he didn’t find a long-term home. In just over a dozen games, he barely contributed, and ultimately left in free agency after the Rangers declined to issue a QO.|**MEH**|
|*Ottawa Senators*|**Boris Katchouk**|3/8/2024 from CHI|21 GP, 2G, 2A, 4P, 0PIM|A once-touted prospect formerly included in the Brandon Hagel trade, Katchouk’s arrival in Ottawa marked his second time on waivers, though the first time he ended up claimed. In nearly two dozen games with the Sens, he provided minimal scoring, posting as many points as the aforementioned Kaliyev in seven more games. Also like Kaliyev, he walked without a QO at the end of the year, but unlike him, Katchouk couldn’t even secure an NHL contract, spending last season with the AHL’s WBS Penguins.|**MEH**|
|*Philadelphia Flyers*|**Kieffer Bellows**|10/27/2022 from NYI|27 GP, 3G, 0A, 3P, 6PIM|Bellows did very little during his third of a season spent in Philly, contributing just three goals and not recording a single assist before he wasn’t offered a QO, similar to the aforementioned two. He was solid enough in the AHL at least? He was nearly PPG with Lehigh Valley.|**MEH**|
|*Pittsburgh Penguins*|**Vladislav Kolyachonok**|2/9/2025 from UTA|12 GP, 0G, 2A, 2P, 8PIM|Kolyachonok’s brief tenure with the Pens wasn’t much to note, with a pair of assists and no goals in a dozen games. He sorta helped the Pens get a 2nd round pick in the Matt Dumba trade at least, so there’s that I guess.|**MEH**|
|*San Jose Sharks*|**Walker Duehr**|1/22/2025 from CGY|8 GP, 2G, 0A, 2P, 0PIM|The NHL’s first South Dakotan was again not much to write about, with a pair of goals and nothing else on a basement Sharks squad. Again, though, he was solid-ish in the AHL, at a bit over half a PPG.|**MEH**|
|*Seattle Kraken*|**Eeli Tolvanen**|12/12/2022 from NSH|210 GP, 55G, 48A, 103P, 57PIM; 14 playoff GP, 3G, 5A, 8P, 6PIM|*Finally*, someone good to write about. Easily the best claim on this list so far, Tolvanen’s arrival in Seattle finally unlocked the potential he never really touched in Nashville; after scoring at over a 0.5 PPG clip immediately after his claim, he recorded his first 40-point season in 2023-24 and his first 20-goal season this past year. An everyday player with the Kraken heading into the second year of an extension, Tolvanen’s developed into a genuinely good middle-6 forward (fitting for Seattle!), and his unceremonious departure from Nashville stands as one of the team’s many botches over the past few seasons.|**GOOD**|
|*St. Louis Blues*|**Kasperi Kapanen**|2/25/2023 from PIT|106 GP, 15G, 22A, 37P, 26PIM|Speaking of potential, now we’ve got a guy who just never really unlocked his. Kapanen’s tenure with St. Louis was unremarkable, with low but not atrocious scoring and one full season wedged in between his claim and departure (also via waivers). Although he wasn't great, he did get over 100 games as a Blue, which takes him out of the “meh” range in my book.|**GOOD**|
|*Tampa Bay Lightning*|**Rūdolfs Balcers**|11/12/2022 from FLA|3 GP, 1G, 0A, 1P, 0PIM|Another long waiver drought, another utterly forgettable tenure. Balcers had a cup of coffee with the Bolts in his last NHL action to date, and was unremarkable if not solid for the AHL Syracuse Crunch.|**MEH**|
|*Toronto Maple Leafs*|**Dakota Mermis**|1/3/2025 from UTA|3 GP, 0G, 1A, 1P, 0PIM|Same as the one before, though Mermis took a slightly more interesting route to this conclusion - he signed with Toronto in the 2024 offseason, playing three AHL games on a conditioning stint off an injury, before getting claimed by Utah and later re-waived. Toronto subsequently claimed him back, where he got three forgettable games as a Leaf before he was back to the AHL.|**MEH**|
|*Utah Mammoth*|**Nick DeSimone**|1/5/2024 from NJD|20 GP, 1G, 5A, 6P, 0PIM|DeSimone’s second appearance on this list is a bit better than his first, as the formerly-fringe NHLer found a steady role in Utah as a depth/7th defenseman. With fine point production for his role and a contract extension signed long before free agency opened, I’d say this is a perfectly fine claim.|**GOOD**|
|*Vancouver Canucks*|**Jiří Patera**|10/7/2024 from BOS|7 AHL GP, 2-2-1, 2.79 GAA, .899 SV%|Oof. Like Mermis, Patera was a re-claim, spending just four days with the Bruins before being grabbed back by his original 2024 signing club in the Canucks. However, his tenure with Vancouver has been a disaster thus far, even with low expectations and another year under contract - he played just seven rather poor games at the start of the AHL season before going down with an undisclosed injury that took him out for the rest of the year. At least he got a Calder Cup ring?|**BAD**|
|*Vegas Golden Knights*|**Raphaël Lavoie**|10/11/2024 from EDM|9 GP, 0G, 0A, 0P, 2PIM|Nine unremarkable games were the end product of the Lavoie merry-go-round, which saw him get claimed by Vegas and Edmonton three times in five days before finally ending up with the Knights. He turned in a solid enough AHL season though, and with a one-year extension, his story’s not quite done yet.|**MEH**|
|*Washington Capitals*|**Matthew Phillips**|3/5/2024 from PIT|1GP, 0G, 0A, 0P, 0PIM|Another re-claim, Philips turned in just a single NHL game in his return to the Capitals after just a few weeks with the Penguins. Between that and a zero-impact AHL playoff run that saw no points in six games, his second go-around seemed rather pointless.|**BAD**|
|*Winnipeg Jets*|**Kaapo Kähkönen**|11/12/2024 from COL|22 AHL GP, 6-14-1, 3.29 GAA, .885 SV%|Finishing off the list with a double whammy of a two-time appearance on this list and a re-claim. Kahkonen returned to the Jets after his brief stint in Colorado, but didn’t see any NHL action - instead, he turned in a truly dreadful tenure with AHL Manitoba, posting a record far under .500 with poor stats to boot. He ended up traded for fellow fringe NHLer Chris Dreidger at the deadline, and though his tenure with AHL Charlotte was notably better, that doesn’t count for this list.|**​BAD**|


So in summary, we’ve got:

* **7** “good"" claims

* **17** ""meh"" claims

* **8** ""bad"" claims

* **3** claims that turned in 50 games or more for their new team (so far)

* **11** claims that turned in 10 or fewer games for their new team, including…

* **3** claims that didn’t play a single NHL game for their new team

* **2** claims that played at least one playoff game for their new team

* **3** players that appeared on this list multiple times

1mhgzde,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1mhgzde/bachelorette_party_weekend_planned_around_the/,Bachelorette party weekend planned around the only parent of the group,"Ugh I would just like to rant about how entitled parents can be.

So backstory. The maid of honor is planning the bachelorette party/weekend for later this year. She sent the group chat of the close friends of the bride and the bridesmaids (I’m a bridesmaid btw). She sent out about 4 weekends in October for options and a few of us preferred the 2 later weekends and was okay with the 2nd weekend of October if the other weekends didn’t work with everyone, but we didn’t prefer it due to work obligations. Some of the ones (and myself) that preferred the last 2 weekends of October had work trainings/conferences around the first 2 options and would be exhausted from flying and working to make up the lost time from the trainings/conferences. Well, the 2nd week of October option was the one that was chosen because one person, who is also a close friend of mine as well, said only the 2nd weekend of October date was the one that could work with her because she’s busy with events for her kids those other weekends. So to accommodate her, the bride and maid of honor decided to pick that weekend. I was a little annoyed by this, but decided to suck it up because this isn’t my wedding and that weekend technically did work for me even if it wasn’t ideal. 

Well, this past week I met up with that friend for coffee (she has two young children by the way). We were talking about the bachelorette weekend as she was excited to go. Then she mentioned, “Well even though I’m excited I might not be able to go because I haven’t told my husband I am doing this and he might not want to watch the kids that weekend and money is kind of tight. And we are also trying for a third baby so I might not be able to drink anyway and it won’t be as fun. I said, “Oh okay, well hopefully you can make it!” But deep down I was so mad because this weekend was planned around her schedule and some of us preferred the other weekends due to work obligations. It was just her sense of privilege that bothered me. Also, the weekend will be local (like 2 hours away at an AirBnB) so it’s definitely on the cheaper side for bachelorette weekends. Just cause she has kids we have to work around her schedule. It also bothered me so much that her husband can’t watch his own kids for a weekend? Overall I know I also sound kind of entitled asking them to work around my schedule for work, but it wasn’t just me that didn’t prefer that weekend, others also had obligations too but this wasn’t planned around our schedules, only hers. This friend isn’t a bridesmaid, so I didn’t want to say anything to her about this as I’m sure she’s upset that she wasn’t asked to be a bridesmaid and I was. 

Anyway I just wanted to rant; thanks for listening. ",7,1754322248.0,childfree,3,1.0,False

Use your imagination to convert this for our sweet Primarchs.

* Chill date : simple activity, almost trivial but the romanticism makes it special (a walk, a coffee, a movie at the cinema...)
* Fancy date : some fun in a place made for the occasion (going to amusement park, a casino, a bar or a nightclub,...)
* Expensive date : spend as much money possible on the finest activities (an upscale restaurant, watching a performance at opera or arena, going shopping...)
* Outdoor date : enjoy healthy natural air before the Mechanicus comes here (a beach trip, a hike, going camping in a feral world, ...)
* Home date : have a romantic moment without moving (a movie in a bedroom, a romantic dinner made by the couple or a servitor, playing a game alone together, ...)

Hi everyone!

I'm an accountant by profession and I usually have around 2 extra hours on weekdays and 4 hours free on both Saturdays and Sundays. I'm hoping to use that time for something productive and helpful—preferably something I can support small businesses with.

I'm particularly interested in:

Social media management for small businesses
Bookkeeping (daily sales, expenses, inventory, and cash balance reporting)

I also have experience in business management (coffee shop) and would be happy to share my LinkedIn profile if you'd like to know more about my background. On top of that, I can create Excel macros to automate repetitive bookkeeping tasks—so if that’s something you need, I’ve got you covered!

💰 Rates start at ₱150 per hour, depending on the complexity of the task—but I’m open to discussion.

Feel free to send me a message if you’re interested or have something in mind. Looking forward to working with you!

Elara should have noticed how quickly the realtor moved through the apartment.
""Vintage charm,"" Mrs. Pemberton said for the third time, her smile never wavering as she ushered Elara past the hall closet. 

""Built in 1889, continuously occupied. The kind of place that truly becomes a home, you know?""

What Elara noticed was the silence. After two years of city noise bleeding through thin walls, the apartment felt like stepping into a cathedral. She closed her eyes in the living room and heard nothing—no traffic, no neighbors, no world at all. Just blessed, perfect quiet.

""I'll take it,"" she said before seeing the bedroom.

Mrs. Pemberton's pen moved across the lease with practiced efficiency. 

""Wonderful. You'll be very happy here. Previous tenants always... settle in so well.""

Later, Elara would remember how the woman's eyes never quite met hers during the signing. How her manicured fingers trembled slightly as she handed over the keys. How she whispered ""good luck"" under her breath before clicking away on expensive heels, leaving Elara alone with her new sanctuary.

But that first day, drunk on the promise of peace, Elara heard only what she wanted to hear.


 
The invasion began gently, like a whisper mistaken for wind.

Cream and two sugars. Always two. Mother taught you properly.

Tuesday morning, coffee steam curling between her fingers, and suddenly Elara was reaching for dairy she never kept. The thought felt natural as breathing, complete with her inner voice's familiar cadence. But she'd drunk coffee black since college.
She laughed it off. Moving stress made people forget things, imagine things. She poured the coffee black and tried to forget the moment entirely.

Not that book. The worn Wuthering Heights, third shelf. Catherine understood love beyond death.

Her hand froze over her bookshelf. She owned no Emily Brontë, had never made it past the first chapter in high school. Yet she could picture exactly where it should be—between her poetry collections, spine cracked from devoted reading.

Too bright. You'll draw their attention. Hide. Always hide.

The whisper came as she held up her favorite yellow sundress, and suddenly the cheerful fabric looked garish, dangerous. Her hands moved without permission, reaching for navy blue instead. Something forgettable. Something safe.

By the end of the week, she'd stopped wearing makeup. Started taking different routes to work. Found herself checking locks she'd already checked, drawing curtains in broad daylight, looking over her shoulder at shadows that weren't there.
Good girl, came the approving thought. Mother would be proud.

But Elara's mother had been dead for ten years, and had never called her ""good girl"" in life.
 


The cruelest discovery was the boundaries of her prison.

Step outside to collect mail, and her mind became beautifully, terrifyingly singular again. Cross back inside, and the unwelcome passengers stirred to life, growing bolder each day. The apartment that had promised sanctuary had become a fishbowl where she was never alone with her own thoughts.

She tried staying at coffee shops after work, wandering the city until exhaustion forced her home. But home always called her back, and with it came the voices.
James Morrison, 1967. Eleanor Holloway, 1983. Sarah Chen, 1954. Margaret Walsh, 1932.

Names that meant nothing to her, yet felt familiar as her own heartbeat. Sometimes she caught herself humming songs she'd never heard, or her hand would move across paper in handwriting that wasn't hers—an old-fashioned script, childish loops, masculine scratches.

We've been waiting, they whispered together. Waiting so long for someone young, someone strong. Someone who could carry us forward.

By the third week, her body had begun betraying her in earnest.

She would find herself standing at windows she didn't remember approaching, staring down at the street with Eleanor's paranoid vigilance. Her hands would reach for books that weren't there with James's literary longing, or arrange flowers with Sarah's innocent joy, or cook elaborate meals she didn't want with Margaret's domestic devotion.

Each morning brought new evidence of her nighttime wanderings—furniture rearranged, photographs turned face-down, her laptop open to real estate websites she'd never visited. All showing other apartments. All bookmarked but never contacted.

Why would you leave? they asked when she stared at the screen. This is home. This is forever.


 
The revelation came in fragments, like a photograph developing in slow motion.

The Herald-Tribune, July 15th, 1932: ""Young Mother Dies in Tragic Fall""

The Metropolitan Journal, August 3rd, 1954: ""Child's Death Shocks Neighborhood""

The City Paper, October 12th, 1967: ""Local Poet Found Dead, Suspected Suicide""

The Daily Chronicle, March 28th, 1983: ""Elderly Woman Dies Alone in Historic Building""

Each obituary was bookmarked on her laptop, each death occurring in apartment 4B. Her apartment. The same building, the same unit, the same mysterious circumstances. Falls, fevers, overdoses, heart attacks—all explained away, all forgotten.

All except by the apartment itself.
We didn't choose to stay, Eleanor's voice was clearest now, sharpened by decades of resentment. We were collected. Like butterflies pinned to boards, like flowers pressed between pages. He keeps us here.

He?

The building. The bones of it. The foundation laid on older bones, older hungers. It's been feeding for over a century, growing stronger with each soul it claims.

The revelation should have terrified her. Instead, Elara felt oddly comforted. She wasn't going insane. She was simply being consumed by something vast and patient and utterly beyond her control.
At least she wouldn't be alone anymore.
 


The silver box beneath the loose floorboard by the hall closet. Where the precious things are kept. Where they've always been kept.

The memory came with Eleanor's urgency, James's romantic desperation, Sarah's childish secrecy, Margaret's maternal protectiveness all layered into one overwhelming need: 
Check the box. Before it's too late. Before someone else finds it.

Elara's feet carried her to the hallway as if they knew the way by heart. The floorboard lifted easily, revealing the hollow space beneath like a secret mouth opening to swallow light.

The silver box gleamed in the darkness, exactly where alien knowledge promised it would be.

Inside, nestled in faded velvet like sleeping creatures, lay their anchors to the world: Margaret's wedding ring worn thin with love, Sarah's drawing of a house with too many windows, James's final love letter tied with ribbon, Eleanor's obsidian necklace that seemed to swallow light.

The moment her fingers brushed the wedding ring, Margaret's life exploded through her:
1932, new bride, happier than she'd ever dreamed possible. The apartment was a wedding gift from her husband's family—""something to grow into,"" they'd said. But Thomas worked such long hours, and the silence pressed against her like a living thing. When she started hearing whispers, she thought it was her imagination. When she started answering back, she thought it was loneliness. When she fell from the window while hanging curtains, she realized too late that loneliness was exactly what the building had been counting on.

Sarah's drawing burned against her palm next:
1954, eight years old and dying of scarlet fever. Her parents had moved her to the apartment thinking the ""clean air"" would help her recover. Instead, she'd heard voices calling from the walls, promising her friends who would never leave, playmates who would never grow up. When the fever took her, she'd been clutching the crayon drawing, whispering to invisible companions about the tea party they'd have forever.

James's letter was a knife of longing:
1967, poet and dreamer, in love with a married man who could never love him back. The apartment had seemed perfect for his tortured artist aesthetic—gothic and romantic and dramatically melancholy. When the voices started, he thought they were his muse. When they began dictating poetry in languages he'd never learned, he thought he was channeling something divine. His final letter was addressed to his impossible love, but his hands had written it in Eleanor's spidery script: ""I go to join the eternal, where love knows no boundaries and loneliness has no meaning.""

Eleanor's necklace was the worst—heavy with decades of accumulated rage:
1983, retired librarian, proud and private and terrified of dying alone. The apartment had been her sanctuary for forty-three years, the one constant in a life of loss. When the cancer diagnosis came, she'd made her peace with death. But the building had other plans. It whispered to her about legacy, about never being forgotten, about joining a family that would cherish her forever. She'd believed, right up until the moment she realized that forever was a very long time to be trapped in four walls with the echoes of the dead.

We tried to warn the others, Eleanor's voice was bitter with decades of failure. But the building is stronger now. Fed by our desperation, our longing, our fear. It can make people forget they ever saw the warnings, ever heard our screams. It chooses its tenants carefully—the lonely ones, the broken ones, the ones who think silence is preferable to connection.

“Why me?” Elara whispered.

Because you ran here. Because you're young enough to last decades. Because your loneliness tastes like ours.
 
The voices grew urgent now, no longer hiding their multiplicity:
Add something precious. Something that matters. It's the only way to stay conscious after the transition. Without an anchor, you'll just... dissolve. Become part of the building's hunger without even the mercy of remembering who you were.

Elara's hand moved without her permission toward the gold locket her grandmother had given her—the only thing of real value she owned, the only link to family love she had left.

Yes, they chorused, eager and desperate. Put it with ours. Join us properly. We'll teach you how to influence the next one, how to make them comfortable, how to help them choose. It's not so bad, once you accept it. We have each other now. We're never alone.

But even as her fingers worked the clasp, some part of Elara still fighting noticed the lie in their promise. They weren't offering companionship. They were offering complicity. They wanted her to help lure the next victim, to be part of the building's hunting pack.

We tried to fight it at first, Margaret admitted. But fighting hurts so much, and surrendering feels like peace. Help us make it easier for the next one. Help us make it gentle.

The locket hung from Elara's fingers, swaying like a pendulum counting down her last moments of choice.

She could drop it in the box and join their eternal, lonely communion. Or she could try to run, knowing that the building would hunt her, that it had roots in her mind now that would never fully let go.

There's a third option, came a new voice—younger than the others, clearer. My name was David Chen. Sarah's older brother. I lived here too, but I got away.

Impossible, Eleanor snapped. No one leaves. Ever.

I never put anything in the box. When Sarah died, I took her drawing and ran. The building couldn't hold me completely without an anchor. It hurt—God, it hurt for years, like phantom limbs screaming. But I lived. I got married, had children, grew old. I died free.

Then how are you here? James asked.
Because I came back. Old man's foolishness—I thought I could save her, save all of you. Instead, I just gave it another soul to collect. But I remember what freedom feels like. I remember the world outside these walls.

It's lying, Eleanor's voice turned vicious. Don't listen. The pain of fighting is unbearable. I've seen tenants try—they shatter like glass, pieces of themselves scattered to the wind. Better to join us willingly.

The locket swayed hypnotically. Each second of hesitation made the choice harder, made surrender seem more reasonable.

Run, David whispered. Run now, before you're too weak. The building is strongest at night, when people are meant to be sleeping. Dawn is coming. Run toward the light.


 
Elara closed her fist around the locket and stumbled toward the door.

The apartment fought her with everything it had. The hallway stretched like taffy, making the front door seem miles away. The walls pressed inward, stealing her breath. The voices rose to a shriek of betrayal and rage.

You can't leave us! We need you! We've been alone so long!

Her hand touched the doorknob and pain exploded through her skull—decades of accumulated loneliness hitting her all at once. She saw Margaret waiting by the window for a husband who never came home, Sarah crying for parents who couldn't hear her through the fever, James writing love letters to a man who would never read them, Eleanor dying inch by inch with no one to hold her hand.

This is what you're condemning us to, Eleanor snarled in her mind. Eternal isolation. Is your freedom worth our suffering?

For a moment, Elara's resolve wavered. The door seemed impossibly heavy, the outside world impossibly bright and harsh and full of judgment. The apartment offered simplicity—just surrender, just accept, just become part of something larger than herself.

Then she thought of David Chen, who had chosen decades of phantom pain over eternal imprisonment. Who had lived and loved and died free, even if he'd come back in the end.

She turned the handle.

Sunlight hit her face like a physical blow, and the voices cut off abruptly, leaving her in blessed, terrifying silence. Her own thoughts, alone in her head for the first time in weeks.

Behind her, she could feel the apartment's rage like heat from a furnace. It would remember her. It would call to her. Part of her would always be connected to those four walls, those desperate voices, that silver box full of anchored souls.
But she was free.



Six months later-

Mrs. Pemberton smoothed her skirt and checked her watch. The new prospect would be here any minute—a recent divorcee, according to her research. Someone seeking a fresh start, a place to heal, a sanctuary from the noise of the world.

Perfect.

She thought, briefly, of Elara Morrison. The one who got away. The building still hummed with frustrated hunger whenever she showed the apartment, still reached for the girl who had slipped through its fingers like water.

But there were always more lonely people in the city. Always more hearts seeking silence, minds seeking peace, souls ready to trade freedom for the promise of never being alone.

The doorbell rang, and Mrs. Pemberton smiled. She had work to do.

Behind her, in apartment 4B, five voices waited in the darkness, ready to welcome their new neighbor home.",1,1754322107.0,HermitOfHorror,0,1.0,False
1mhgwy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1mhgwy2/functional_addict_help_with_recovery_stack/,Functional addict - help with recovery stack,"Hey everyone, long shot but I’m desperate for feedback on my recovery plan. I'm a high-functioning addict working a fulltime job, which makes it hard to quit. 

My usage:

* \>1 year on daily amphetamine (50–150 mg racemic paste, \~50 % purity) every morning
* \>2 years on pregabalin, up to 300 mg. Recently upped to 600mg to feel *something*
* Recent coke binge (1.5 g over two days, zero sleep), then five days clean from stims (Xanax + Lyrica + booze)
* Restarted speed (same batch). My usual dose does nothing, so I upped it to 350 mg oral + 150 mg snorted. Still nothing, just slightly higher HR and BP (120/80 120BPM). Normally, I would reach hypertension grade 1
* Zyprexa (olanzapine) 5 mg nightly for over a month (doctor gave for sleep), and occasional use the two months prior (3-4 times a week). Only now realizing it probably blocked D2/D3 receptors, probably why I've felt so damn apathetic. Don't use anymore
* Snus + coffee daily: caffeine gives a tiny fog-lift, snus doesn't kick like it used to

I’m flat, apathetic, zero motivation, don't do shit at work. Lost interest in everything. I struggle to think, talk, and write. My memory is fucked. I've never felt this dumb before, and it's honestly kinda scary.

And it feels like this just randomly happened. But, when thinking back, I think the downfall slowly started with Zyprexa. It has a half life of about 30 hours, and my last dose was a week ago. Don't feel any improvements yet, and I'm not even sure if it is the main cause. I've felt like shit for a while, but I assumed it was tolerance.

I also think I've semi-fucked myself by using megadoses in an attempt to feel normal 

  
My current stack for recovery is:

* AM: Bromantane 100 mg + N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine 300 mg + Mr.Happy stack + coffee and snus
* Day: Sabroxy, adaptogens, fish oil, D3/K2+C, probiotics
* PM: KSM-66, magnesium, CBD, mirtazapine 15 mg, NAC
* Sleep: 10mg melatonin, occasional use of xanax (try to limit this one)
* Thinking about adding: BPC-157 + TB-500, Semax, Selank, microdosing psilicybin, ketamine (can apparently accelerate the restoration of dopamine receptors) 

What I need help with:

1. Am I completely fucked?
2. Is my stack alright? Missing anything crucial?
3. I have PPAP HCl (interesting compound), phenylpiracetam, could they aid in recovery?
4. I also have MK-677, doesn't hurt to try?
5. Sleep hacks: I hate benzos but can’t sleep. Any alternatives that won't wreck my motivation?

I would like to look normal and stay functional at work while quitting these drugs. I fully understand that I have to slowly taper, eat healthy, sleep, exercise, etc., and I am trying to do that. I know it will suck, but I'm looking for some guidance from fellow biohackers. Brutal honesty, please. What would you do if you were me?

TL;DR: Functional addict (daily speed + pregabalin + Zyprexa + Mirtazapine + occational benzo) is now flat-lined; working full-time but zero drive. Desperate for a reality-check on my recovery stack and next steps. Thanks.",2,1754322094.0,Biohackers,3,0.75,False

Teh modern professional relies heavily on their laptop, often carrying it between home, office, and client meetings. Extended sun exposure or leaving a laptop in a hot car can lead to overheating, potentially damaging the device and losing critical data. A heat-insulated laptop sleeve offers crucial protection, regulating temperature and safeguarding against extreme heat. These sleeves are not just about portability; they are about preserving the longevity and performance of your valuable technology. In 2025, advancements in materials and design make these sleeves more effective and stylish then ever before.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a heat-insulated laptop sleeve hinges on several key features that combine to create a protective barrier against external temperatures. Advanced materials, a secure fit, and thoughtful design all contribute to the sleeve's ability to maintain an optimal internal temperature for your laptop.

**Material Composition:** The key to effective heat insulation lies in the materials used. Premium sleeves typically incorporate a multi-layered construction. An outer shell of durable, water-resistant material like ballistic nylon protects against physical damage and moisture. The intermediate layer utilizes a high-performance insulating material such as aerogel, closed-cell foam, or a metallic reflective layer that minimizes heat transfer via conduction, convection, and radiation. The inner lining uses a soft, non-scratch fabric, such as microfiber fleece, to protect the laptop's surface.

**Insulation Thickness and density:** the thickness and density of the insulation layer directly impact the sleeve's ability to resist heat transfer. A thicker, denser layer provides greater thermal resistance. Though, excessive thickness can increase the sleeve's bulkiness, making it less portable.An ideal balance is typically achieved with an insulation layer between 5mm and 10mm thick, using materials with a density optimized for minimal weight and maximum thermal performance.For exmaple. sleeves claiming enhanced performance should specify the R-value (thermal resistance) of the insulation material.

**Closure Mechanism:** A secure closure mechanism is crucial to prevent heat from entering the sleeve through gaps. High-quality sleeves often feature a combination of zippers and magnetic closures. The zipper should be designed with a tight seal to minimize airflow, and the magnetic closures should provide a secure, consistent seal along the opening. Look for features like weather-resistant zippers and reinforced stitching around the closure points for added durability and protection.

**Internal Dimensions and Laptop Compatibility:** Accurate internal dimensions are essential for ensuring a snug fit and preventing the laptop from shifting inside the sleeve. The dimensions should be clearly specified, taking into account the laptop's thickness as well as its width and length. many sleeves are designed to accommodate a range of laptop sizes,but its critical to verify compatibility with your specific model to avoid a loose fit,which can compromise insulation effectiveness. Consider if the sleeve has corner straps to further secure the laptop in place.

**Ventilation System (Optional):** some advanced sleeves incorporate a ventilation system to prevent condensation buildup inside the sleeve. This can be particularly importent in humid environments or when the laptop is frequently used in hot conditions. The ventilation system may consist of small breathable panels or strategically positioned vents that allow air to circulate without compromising the insulating properties of the sleeve. These vents should be designed to prevent water intrusion.

**Durability and Water Resistance:** The sleeve should be constructed from durable materials that can withstand the rigors of daily use. Water resistance is essential to protect the laptop from spills and rain. Look for sleeves made from water-resistant fabrics with sealed seams and weather-resistant zippers. The overall construction should be robust, with reinforced stitching at stress points to prevent tearing and ensure longevity.

## Core Benefits

investing in a quality heat-insulated laptop sleeve provides numerous benefits,protecting your valuable device from damage and ensuring optimal performance. these sleeves go beyond simple protection from scratches and bumps; they actively regulate the temperature of your laptop, extending its lifespan and improving reliability.

**Prevents Overheating:** The primary benefit of a heat-insulated laptop sleeve is preventing overheating.Laptops are designed to operate within a specific temperature range, and exceeding this range can lead to performance degradation, system crashes, and even permanent damage.By regulating the internal temperature, the sleeve helps the laptop stay within its optimal operating range, even in hot environments. such as, if you leave your laptop in a car on a sunny day, the sleeve can significantly reduce the rate at which the internal temperature rises.

**Extends Laptop Lifespan:** Excessive heat can shorten the lifespan of electronic components,leading to premature failure. By minimizing heat exposure, the sleeve helps protect these components, extending the overall lifespan of your laptop. This translates to fewer repairs, less downtime, and a better return on your investment. Studies show that maintaining a consistent operating temperature can extend the life of sensitive electronics by up to 30%.

**Maintains Optimal Performance:** When a laptop overheats, it frequently enough throttles its performance to prevent damage. This means that the CPU and GPU reduce their clock speeds, resulting in slower performance and lag. A heat-insulated sleeve helps prevent throttling by keeping the laptop cool, allowing it to maintain its optimal performance level, even during demanding tasks. Users will experience smoother multitasking, faster rendering, and a more responsive user experience.

**Protects Against Condensation:** Rapid temperature changes can lead to condensation forming inside the laptop,which can cause corrosion and short circuits. A heat-insulated sleeve can definitely help prevent condensation by moderating the temperature changes and preventing the laptop from suddenly cooling down in a humid environment. This is particularly critically important in regions with high humidity or during seasonal transitions.

**Provides Added Security:** While not its primary function,a heat-insulated laptop sleeve can offer a degree of security by making it less obvious that you are carrying a laptop. The sleeve can blend in with other items, making it less attractive to potential thieves.Some sleeves also include hidden pockets or compartments for storing valuables,adding an extra layer of security.

## FAQs Section

Considering a heat-insulated laptop sleeve can raise several questions. Here are some common inquiries and their answers, to help you make the best decision.

**How effective are these sleeves in extreme heat?**
The effectiveness of a heat-insulated laptop sleeve in extreme heat depends on factors like the sleeve's material, thickness, and duration of exposure. High-quality sleeves can significantly reduce the rate at which heat penetrates, keeping the laptop cooler for a longer period. However,it's essential to understand that no sleeve can wholly eliminate heat transfer indefinitely. Under extreme conditions, you should still avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight or high temperatures.

**Are these sleeves bulky and arduous to carry?**
While some older models might have been bulky, advancements in materials technology have led to sleeker, more lightweight designs. A good heat-insulated laptop sleeve should strike a balance between insulation and portability. Look for sleeves that use lightweight insulation materials and have a slim profile. Many sleeves also feature ergonomic designs and comfortable handles or shoulder straps for easy carrying.

**can I use this sleeve in cold weather to protect my laptop?**
Yes, a heat-insulated laptop sleeve works in both hot and cold weather. It acts as a thermal barrier,slowing down heat transfer in either direction. In cold weather, it helps keep the laptop warm, preventing it from getting too cold, which can also damage electronic components. This means the sleeve provides year-round protection for your device.

**What if the sleeve gets wet? Will it still work effectively?**
Most high-quality heat-insulated laptop sleeves are designed with water-resistant materials. If the sleeve gets wet, it should still provide some level of insulation. However, it's crucial to dry the sleeve as soon as possible to prevent moisture from damaging the laptop. Look for sleeves with sealed seams and weather-resistant zippers to minimize water intrusion.If the sleeve becomes saturated, its insulation properties may be temporarily reduced.

I couldn’t get out until early afternoon, so I opted for a simple out and back: Bloomville to Stamford and back, just shy of 26 miles total.

Conditions couldn’t have been better: breezy, 70s, bluebird skies. The trail itself is a mix of hard and soft gravel, winding through some seriously beautiful Catskill countryside. You get a great balance of open pastures, quiet streams, and shaded stretches. It felt incredibly peaceful, with hardly anyone else out there.

Stamford made for a perfect turnaround town. If you’re looking to grab a coffee or bite, it’s got options. I thought about continuing on to Grand Gorge, but honestly, I was content with the ride I had. I’ll definitely come back to do the full stretch when I’ve got more time.

I rode my Salsa Vaya Ti, which handled the route well, but I’m starting to feel the limitations of the 35mm tires it came with. Thinking about bumping up to 45s for better comfort and grip as I get into rougher gravel and light singletrack.

Highly recommend this trail if you're in the area. Smooth miles, great scenery, and very chill vibes.

1mhgrcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/mitralvalveprolapse/comments/1mhgrcx/my_diagnosis/,My diagnosis.,"Hey there people. I wanted to share my diagnosis with people who would understand me the best.

So, my official diagnosis is mild MVP with mild MR, but I also have PACs.

For reference, I am 28 years old male, non-smoker, non-drinker. I don't exercise a lot and I do have a type of sedetary lifestyle like 60% of the week due to work (embedded engineer) and gaming/side projects at home.

Long story short, in April this year, I was sitting at work doing overtime stuff (as usual), most people already left so it was quiet, and at fixed points of time I could feel my heart do a hard ""thump"". Naturally, as everyone else, I have been stuck in a vicious cycle of stress due to deadlines at work, poor sleep(5 hours or less), drinking 5-6 double coffees a day for a period of 7-8 months.

At first I thought it was due lifestyle I was leading at that time, but once I caught those first few thumps, it was hard not to catch them again and again and again, and anxiety struck. 

So I booked up cardiologist, went in, the first ECG they did they caught a run of 3 trigeminies. Good thing is they are actually not overloaded with work so the cardiologist booked me all the necessary diags in the next few days.

So I did blood tests - all good; Holter 24h - out of 115028 beats it came up with around 7400 (6%) PACs, out of which 1008 were couplets, and the rest were single PACs; Echo - showed up mild MVP with mild MR, EF 62%, structurally normal rest of the heart (I can post other parameters); Stress test - I reached 150W on ergocycle, it was 3rd minute of 7th stage and we stopped it because I reached the target HR, also PACs started susbsiding as my HR was going up.

The conclusion of cardiologist was that I can return to all daily activities, I was suggested aerobic exercises in order to preserve heart function and strenghten heart muscle.

I was also put on flecainide 100mg daily.

I will be going on for an expert echo this October, as he wants to check with his colleagues who have more experience with MVPs.

So after all this, I can't really complain, since I might have got it easier than other people, but there is a little bug in the back of head called SCA  that sometimes frightens me a bit.

We’ve had this discussion loosely before but I wanted to see everyone’s thoughts again as a refresher.

I don’t want a buyout at a $5B valuation but would take it at $15B. We have seen many companies take the money and run. YouTube, Instagram etc. 

With the need for AI in healthcare and the length and resources it takes to actually build out a successful model why wouldn’t a big dog like UNH and HUM (I know we have subdomains for humana so obviously it made sense for them to use the product and not own the product) just make the offer? They could inherit the revenue streams from Duke, Iowa, HUM, etc and enhance their own internal metrics.

If I’m UNH or HUM I’m looking to buy my way into the AI space and profit bigly. (And maybe Humana wants the try before they buy approach) We have long discussed how these companies are the dinosaurs of the industry and haven’t done anything innovative in years, now could be the splash.

Optum Health has been building out their own platform but is still years behind CA. 

A $15B market cap puts CLOV at like $30. That is what 13% of UNH market cap. So spend that much and acquire the tech needed to save/make 100s of millions and eventually billions. 

Own and implement the technology that makes CA the standard across healthcare. Counterpart is a much lore sellable/acquirable name as it show no branding ownership to CLOV.

I’m posting my story here because nosleep has strict rules. This is my first ever story and it didn’t gain much traction for some reason, so I’m posting it here where people may enjoy it more. Anyway… I proudly present…

I'm related to a Wendigo.

Sorry if the title seems abrupt. After reading this, it'll make sense... I hope. 

You’ve heard this story a million times before. I’m a teenager who recently moved to Minnesota. So recently, in fact, I can barely remember the town’s name. Just search for generic towns on any search engine and I’m certain it’ll show up. I’m not going try avoiding exposition because I feel inclined to share this information with as many online strangers as I can. 

I moved into the town a month ago with my mom and dad. I lived in Virginia before, so adapting to Minnesota was not something I was thrilled about. I had to leave the few friends I had. My parents assured me that I would find people to hang out with. I didn’t really need any friends. I worked better alone. My parents let me bring my Xbox, but I believe they hoped I would leave it behind. Apparently, we moved here because my grandpa died. We are inheriting his fortune.

When I first left the car, I set my eyes on the house. No, my house. I had to live there. It was a shack if anything. It was a one-story house with faded log walls and a drywall interior. It had two bedrooms, a living room/kitchen, a bathroom, and an attic. My dad quickly monopolized the kitchen for his work. His laptop never left the island in the kitchen. My mom looked for a job around town. I explored the bleak house, hoping to find something fun.

“I’m bored.” I complained to my dad. He shrugged. “There’s plenty of things to do around here. Go shopping, go explore the woods. Find people to hang out with.”

“Wow, thanks for the help.” I said, masking the sarcasm in my voice. The look he gave me told me I wasn’t hiding it well. Maybe I didn’t want to. I expected Grandpa’s fortune to be grander, but what did I know? I never met him, at least when I was sentient.

My dad raised his hand and gestured towards his birthmark: two red splotches on the palm. “This mark means you’re a son of the Barkley family. If you embarrass yourself, you’re embarrassing your bloodline.” he insisted.

I rolled my eyes, being intentionally rebellious. “You’ve said that a million times. I don’t care anymore.”

“Just go somewhere, I have a call.” My father said, shooing me away like an animal. I grabbed my coat and went out the door. I walked down the sidewalk of the bustling town. The cars slowly drove past, their exhaust pipes producing fog in the cold, winter air. Everything foul here was fair in its own way. I guess their fumes propelled them towards their goal somehow. Unlike me, who was aimlessly walking until something interesting happened.

I stumbled on the icy sidewalk before grabbing on to a streetlight. I heard snickering behind me. I turned to see a group of three teenagers. “You new here?” one asked, pulling his beanie over his ears.

I nodded, nervously rubbing the outline of my birthmark on my left hand.

 “Well in that case… my name is James.” he held out his gloved hand. I shook it politely. He examined me closely, his freckles seemingly popping out of his pale face in the cold. “You really are new. I only assumed as much because you almost took a tumble there.” he gestured towards the ground.

“I’m not the most graceful.” I said. “Anyway, who’re the others with you?” I asked.

James turned to look at the other two teens. “This guy here is Kyle.” upon hearing his name, he gave me a flimsy wave. Kyle had messy blonde hair and was taller than the other two. He could pass for a surfer if he had a tan, which he didn’t.

The other person was a girl. She quickly introduced herself as Lucy. She had long, slightly curly hair, a wide face, and an expression I could only summarize as irritation. “Can we go now?” she asked James.

“Not yet, we got to welcome the guy. There ain’t many kids around here, remember?” he said.

Lucy scowled. “Our group is fine. We don’t need anyone else to hang out with.” She wrapped her scarf around her neck.

Kyle shrugged. “I don’t care what he does. Wait a minute, what’s your name, anyway?” he turned to me.

“My name is Drew. Andew, if you’re feeling brave.” I said jokingly.

“Alright, Andrew…” Lucy said, her voice dripping with venom, “We have to go now.”

What did I do to this woman? I didn’t understand. James gave me an apologetic look. “I guess we better be going.” James said.

“Wait, one more thing.” I interjected. He turned around and raised an eyebrow, waiting for me to elaborate.

“Where’s the candy store?” I asked. Kyle pointed to a store on the other side of the street as they left. They were a bit standoffish, but at least they weren’t pricks. I crossed the street, entered the candy store, and purchased an overpriced bag of nameless gummy worms. I left the store, pushing open the glass door as the bell rang. I wandered through the town, mapping every building as I got closer to the woods.

I reached the border between the town and the forest. The trees were bare, devoid of leaves. Even still, the forest seemed thick and unforgiving. I stepped into the woods and wandered aimlessly. The bitter winter air nipped at my nose and cheeks, making me regret not wearing a scarf.

“Hello.” A voice called out from the darkness. I perked up at the sudden voice. “Who’s there?” I asked, realizing too late that my voice was unsteady and nervous. Not a good first impression on my end.

“I don’t know who you are.” The voice said. I tilted my head, trying to get the unknown person to see my confusion.

“Where are you?” I asked the woods. The cold breeze stirred dead leaves past me.

“You are new.” It spoke once again. Its voice was mystical, as if blending with the wind. Maybe it was the wind, looking back. Even so, it spoke words I could understand.

I chewed on a sour gummy worm.

“I am hungry.” The wind said.

 I held out a gummy worm. “Do you want some of my food?” I asked. I don’t know why I even bothered talking to whatever it was. The voice paused, as if it was thinking.

A rattling sound echoed through the forest. Maybe it was a woodpecker.

“I’m starving…” its voice lowered, sounding raspy.

I tossed the bag of candy into the forest, wasting 13 dollars. “I gave you my food. Eat all you want.”

I heard loud footsteps crunching in the snow. *Tick tick. Clack clack.* Unknown sounds echoed through the forest. The footsteps came closer. A dog rushed past me from behind, barking into the woods. I looked down, startled slightly at the Labrador. It barked aggressively, its tail pointed upright. An older man rushed over to the dog, grabbing its collar. He turned to me.

“Sorry, kid.” he said. “Mabel gets loose too often, but I always know to find her here.” he chuckled. He went silent and turned to the forest. A bird called out from the woods. He grimaced. “Kid.” he turned to me. “Don’t go in there. Hunters could shoot you on accident, you could get lost, you could even drown in the lake. Stay very well away.”

I nodded. “What about the guy in the forest? Isn’t he in danger too?”

His expression grew concerned. “There’s nobody in there. The wind whistles through the thick branches. It sounds almost like voices.” he said. I felt like he didn’t believe in his own reasoning. He sighed. “You’re new here.” he observed.

I confirmed his statement. He cleared his throat, petting his dog’s yellow fur. “Listen up then. These woods aren’t safe, but…” his expression darkened. “It can, at times, be safer than the town.”

I insisted he elaborate. “The town has frequent famines. Food spoils and berries stop being as plentiful. We don’t get a lot of imports, either. When we get bad storms, we have to rely on stored, canned goods. It isn’t nearly as bad as it once was. Even if food is readily available, the danger is still there.”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“I’m saying that people abandon their humanity. They eat each other when everything dries up. There isn’t always a justification to it. People just… snap.”

I was at a loss for words. He sighed. “It isn’t like that anymore. We haven’t had an incident in five years.”

“So why warn me?” I asked.

He paused. “Because it isn’t going to stop. As long as it still breathes.” He muttered, looking at the forest.

“It?” I asked.

“It lives in the woods. It never bothered people physically, just cursed them in a way. Until a few months ago, that is. We’ve started to distance our kids from the forest where it lives.”

Mabel whimpered and dropped her tail low. I groaned. “What is it?” I said, getting impatient. I wasn’t willing to hear a vague campfire story.

“It’s a Wendigo. A beast of Indian… erm… native folklore. Do you know what they are?” he asked.

I nodded. “I’ve seen YouTube videos on them, even read a few books. You think a cryptid is out there?”

He stared into the forest. “Absolutely. They don’t believe me, but as long as one person believes, the Wendigo will be more cautious in its approach. You came here not long after the old man died. Why is that?” he asked me.

“If you’re referring to Clarence Barkley, he’s my grandfather.” I explained.

“My condolences.” the man said.

“No worries, I never knew him anyway.” I said reassuringly.

The trees creaked and branches snapped. A strong gust of wind blew past.

“Oh.” he said. “Good for you.”

“Was he an asshole?” I asked.

He shrugged. “He was entitled and snobby, as most rich people are. He was usually secluded, though.” The man explained. “He rarely came into town, and when he did, it was usually to buy meat. Lots of meat.”

Apparently, my grandfather was aloof. He stayed out of everyone’s way when he could. He wasn’t the nicest when people met him, though.

“So why did you ask why I came here?” I asked.

“Nobody ever comes here unless they have something to gain from it. I’m assuming you were claiming his will.”

“Yeah, that’s about it.” I said.

The man exhaled and watched the trees. “Do you know how to become a Wendigo?” he asked me.

“I haven’t really tried before.” I said sarcastically. “But I do know how they come to be.”

“Good. Try not to lose yourself. If you get hungry, eat whatever you can find. If you want more personal things, pray to God. Be happy with what you have.” The man said.

“I’m familiar with that stuff. I’m a good person- or I try to be.” I explained.

The man chuckled. “Just keep it in mind.”

Mabel tucked her tail between her legs and whimpered as she stared into the forest. The old man sighed. “Looks like I should head back.” He waved goodbye as he walked his dog home.

I went home after that. I entered the house, knocked off my boots, and peeled away at my winter gear until I was back into my casual attire. My father was busy on his computer, picking up work calls. He groaned. “God damn it. This is not the right time for a prank call!” he stormed off, dropping the phone on the table. I heard the bathroom door slam shut.

I crept over to the phone and held it to my ear curiously. On the other end was static. How was it a prank call? It could be an accidental dial. The phone suddenly picked up a new sound. It sounded like tv static, but it increased in volume slowly. After about 10 seconds, the sound was a deafening screech. I hung up the phone.

I decided to snoop around the house, looking for any stuff left behind. I wish we inherited the mansion, but the repair costs would double our debt. I blew the dust off of an old laptop someone left for some reason. It was even plugged in and fully charged. I turned on the laptop. Despite being a newer model, the laptop only had retro games. I decided to play Doom instead. If this computer belonged to my grandpa, he had good taste.

After 30 minutes of Doom, I played some sort of deer hunting game. It was 3D, but very primitive for a 3D game. The deer were basically advanced polygons. I aimed my cursor at a moving deer, causing it to activate a cutscene of the bullet traveling towards the deer. Before the bullet hit, the color of the screen inverted and crackled with a buzzing static. The deer’s peaceful black eyes glowed white, its face almost twisted into a sadistic smile. Of course, it was just a weird glitch. The deer’s antlers multiplied in size as the 3D model began to lose its form. The computer shut itself off.

I sighed and stuffed the laptop into a drawer. I was going to get it fixed eventually so I don’t have to buy any duplicate games on my Xbox.

Over the next few weeks, everything just got worse. The voice in the wilderness kept talking, although by now I had ignored it completely. Everything was fine until it said my name. I walked by the forest entrance to go to school and meet up with my friends and Lucy.

“Aaaaandreeeew.” the voice called out like a taunting child. I froze and turned to the forest. “How do you know my name?!” The words sat on the edge of my tongue. At the last moment, I held those words back. If I gave the thing any attention, I would surely regret it. The wind rattled the dead branches like some sort of bony windchime. The icy air felt like daggers on my skin.

I walked away, resuming my travels. “Aaandreeew…” it rasped. I ignored it.

“You’ve grown so much since the last time I saw you.” it said, clear as day.

I continued to walk away. It was just saying that to get my attention, whatever it was. This Wendigo has been a pain for quite some time. I wasn’t going to give it the satisfaction. It went silent as I walked away. As I walked down the road, I noticed a dead deer on the curb. I walked around it, but a few minutes later, that task would be impossible.

The entire road was flooded with dead deer. Piles upon piles of corpses littered the streets, bleeding into the drainage systems. Even getting near the pile sent an overwhelming stench towards me. I vomited in the grass. The putrid odor rattled my systems and brought me to my knees. The corpses were suddenly dragged one by one into the bushes. My head pounded as I tried my best to get away. I felt a lanky, cold hand grab my ankle and drag me away slowly.

 I turned around to see white eyes staring at me from the bushes, concealed in the morning darkness. The extended bony arm tugged weakly. The silver eyes never left me. its translucent, pale skin crinkled with every movement, as if it was too tight for its own body. The faint outline of its humanoid face made me wish I was dead beforehand. I dug my nails into the concrete road, desperately trying to anchor myself. As I was dragged closer to the bushes, I could see its disgusting human teeth emerge from the shadows to devour me.

I used my free leg to kick the face of the hollow creature. It groaned in pain and released me. I made a mad dash for the school, stumbling over the corpses of deer. When I assumed I was safe, I turned around to see the largest deer in the pile being dismembered by the arms. The head was ripped off with a sound I could only compare to a tree snapping. That deer must’ve lived for at least a decade. Now, its elder antlers were being brandished by an imposter.

I made it to school, which probably wasn’t the best idea. I was so distracted by what just happened that it didn’t occur to me that I was covered in deer blood. The classroom shrieked in fear, dragging me out of my braindead state. I was brought into the counselor’s office for questioning. They didn’t believe my story until they looked out the window. Of course, I never mentioned the actual Wendigo. I just said that a herd of deer died, which wasn’t false, but not completely true either.

I was certain it was the Wendigo. It was starving and undoubtably bloodthirsty. It was also cold. Its touch was like the pole of a stop sign in winter.

They eventually gave me some temporary clothes and sent me on my way. In third period, an earsplitting scream rang from the forest. It sounded like a mix of a human, elk, and electronic static. It was impossibly loud, causing us to plug in headphones or cover our ears.

 The sound continued for the next week.

Our town adapted quickly. We learned some basic hand signals and got very good at understanding body language. The town became barren of all animals. Deer had migrated to a new area. Dogs fled to find safety, ending up in ditches or dumpsters. I found Mabel under my bed, which scared the hell out of me.

I was sitting on my couch when my mom motioned for me to take out my earbuds. I was greeted with the sound of silence. I almost teared up in joy. Authorities investigated the source of the sound with no success. They couldn’t even blame anything. The mayor eventually told the town not to worry about it. To no one’s surprise, everyone kept worrying about it.

I wandered through the cold town. I bought candy, as usual, and went on with my day. James, Kyle, and Lucy intercepted me. “Long time no see.” James said to me. “We thought it was you that was screamin’ all week.” he said jokingly.

“What do you want from me?” I said, realizing too late that it sounded rude and confrontational. Luckily, James didn’t pick up on the change of tone.  
“We wanna go exploring.” Kyle said.

“They want you to come with them. It wasn’t my idea.” Lucy said.

“…Thanks.” I said. “So where are we going?”

“We’re gonna go to the old mansion in the woods. It’ll be just like one of those old movies. You in?” James said excitedly.

Every instinct I had knew to decline his offer. No sane person would randomly wander into the woods. That’s not only dangerous, but stupid. “Sure, I’ll go.”

Lucy sighed, likely hoping I would decline. I’m not the best at understanding social cues, so I have no clue why this chick was so pissed at me. Maybe she had a crush on me. That would be cool.

“When are we going?” I asked.

“Now.” James answered quickly.

I didn’t bother asking if they had all the supplies. Lucy had a comically large backpack strapped onto her shoulders. Despite being shorter than all of us, she was the strongest by far. What a terrifying combination.

We made our way through the frozen forest. The only sound we heard was our footsteps. When we got closer to the manor, we occasionally heard disembodied voices conversing from somewhere in the woods.

“Are others here?” I asked nervously. It occurred to me that this was my grandfather’s house. At least, it was. It looked much better in the pictures. The windows weren’t boarded up back then.

“Those voices are always there.” Kyle said as we reached the front porch. We opened the door, which was strangely unlocked. At least it made me feel less uneasy about breaking into my grandfather’s house. When we entered the manor, I realized why my family had our own house. The mansion was run down, overwhelmed with cobwebs and deep scrapes in the wood. It looked as if a bear had been living here.

Lucy aimed the flashlight around, the bright light waving in the darkness. The light reflected off of a bleached deer skull with large antlers that had been mounted on the wall. We went up the stairs. The door to the bathroom was locked. Lucy slammed into the door, snapping it in half. We ducked under the broken door and stared into the bathtub. The entire tub was filled with decayed chicken bones and decomposed meat.

“Jeez, the old man was a glutton.” James remarked.

Bones were haphazardly thrown around the bathroom. We dug through the pile, looking for something of value. There was nothing. Kyle scoffed. “Maybe he took his money to the grave.”

“We aren’t digging him up, are we?” I asked.

“There’s no body.” James said. “Even his death is shrouded in mystery.” he said ominously, expecting a fearful reaction from one of us.

Kyle exhaled. “It isn’t as deep as you make it seem.”

Dead branches tapped against the window. The cold breeze made the house feel somewhat smaller. I couldn’t help but notice that the tree looked… off. It was like one of those insects that look like leaves. They look like a leaf, but they’re alive. We continued snooping around the rooms, splitting up along the way. I went back to the front door and began to close it, as we had left it open before.

The voice called out from the forest. “You heard my call.” It spoke. I closed the door. I chose to ignore it as usual. I was desensitized to it at this point. It hasn’t done much to me so far, so I doubt it could deal any real damage. It continued talking as I walked away from the door.

I snooped around for a bit longer. Nothing gathered my interest. For a mansion, it was absolutely disgusting. The door rattled as the wind beat against it. I should’ve known better then. Blaming things on the wind only got me so far.

From upstairs, I watched with bated breath as the doorknob clicked and opened. The room grew cold, and a draft embraced me. Snow glistened against the dusty carpet. The door creaked open completely. Standing on the porch was something I couldn’t begin to explain. It had two long, emaciated legs. It could be human, but the hooves denied my reasoning. Massive bony hands hung down from its body, its slender fingers twitching and clicking claws together. Multicolored fur coated most of the body in brutal patches, like a shaven dog. No, it was as if it put the fur on itself.

One hooved foot tapped against the floor as it began to step inside. As it crouched down, I could see its exposed ribcage hugging a sack of organs weakly inside it. Before I could view its visage, I backed away from the upstairs balcony and into a bedroom. I peeked behind the doorway, waiting for something to happen.

The long hand rose from under the balcony. It reached for the skull mounted on the wall. The skull disconnected and fell down into the large hands of the entity. After a brief period of silence, the antlers rose from behind the edge of the balcony. The two hands gripped onto the fence as the thing pulled its whole mass up. The skull was no decoration, it was a mask.

The deer skull looked as dead as ever. The eye sockets were empty except for a tiny silver light in each eye. The carpet near the thing froze. The thing’s eyes never left me as it stretched its hand closer to me. It was almost like the arm was extending according to the will of the lifeform. If you could even call it a lifeform.

I breathed heavily, fear washing over. My breath escaped my lips small clouds of warm steam. I was so concentrated on the Wendigo that I forgot I hadn’t come here alone. Kyle had appeared in the doorway, staring at the starving creature. It was so hungry; I just knew it. My primal instincts told me to feed it.

I extended my hand hesitantly. The Wendigo directed its clawed hand to me. My finger nudged the cold keratin as we connected. “Drew?” Kyle squeaked. I slowly turned to him. Kyle backed away from the balcony. The Wendigo pressed the side of its face against the fence, its mouth agape. I could see the humanoid mouth behind the deer skull dripping with saliva. Its silver eye peered at me. It panted and groaned, trying to inch closer to me.

“Drew, stop.” Kyle pleaded. I stared at him blankly. The Wendigo knocked over a coffee table, shattering some sort of glass object as it pressed itself against the upstairs balcony. A hand gripped my wrist and yanked me away. I turned to see Lucy scowling at me. “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” she hissed. I hadn’t noticed her when I entered the room, so her startling me didn’t help my situation.

I explained to her that it felt natural, like putting your foot in a shoe or popping your back. It was instinctual. She looked at me like I was crazy. I couldn’t blame her. The Wendigo panted, its swollen bovine tongue hanging out the side of its mouth. Lucy squeezed my wrist harder, then let go. “Fine. Be difficult for everyone. I personally don’t care if you die or not.” She sighed. “But they do.”

I wasn’t sure what she meant. She noticed my confused expression. “You have friends, remember? They care about you, and since I care for them, I don’t want them to be grief-stricken. They already have me.” she frowned, realizing she said too much.

I heard the voice of James shout in fear. The Wendigo turned to see him; its inner mouth twisted into a frustrated grin. Its gums bled as the jaw squeezed shut. “Jesus.” James said in terror. The Wendigo thrust its clawed finger at where I believed James was. I heard a cough, groan, and thud as James collapsed. It dragged James’s corpse to the edge and picked it up. I heard the unmistakable sound of chewing, crunching, and ripping.

I knew it was safe. I stood up and walked out of my hiding place, down the stairs, past the feeding creature, and out into the cold forest. I averted my gaze from the thing as it ate. I could hear the swaying of its bushy, matted tail. My fear suddenly returned when I left the mansion. My friend was being devoured messily by a beast of folklore. It almost killed me, and I let it.

I heard a creak as Lucy and Kyle crept out of the building. The Wendigo gurgled and turned to face us. Its large body was barely illuminated in the dark mansion, yet the crimson blood was clearly visible pooling at its feet. The two looked up at me with a look of pure terror. They descended the porch stairs and stood behind me. The Wendigo stood up, its joints popping and cracking. A gurgle resonated deep in its maw as blood trickled out from its deer skull. Its fingers twitched with every movement. Paralyzed with fear, I could only stare as it made its way towards the front door. A picture frame fell from the wall and landed at the hoof of the starved creature.

The Wendigo looked down, its massive antlers scraping against the drywall. It looked down at the shattered glass. The bleached skull reflected in the shards. Its piercing eyes hovered over the printed image. I could not tell what it was, but the image seemed to provoke the entity. It groaned and slashed at the image, tearing it to shreds.

The towering, emaciated forest spirit tilted its head and squeezed through the door. Yellow wallpaper hung from its antlers like confetti, occasionally glistening in the stray beams of sun leaking through the clouds. It shuffled closer, its hooves clacking on the wooden porch. The porch creaked and groaned under the weight of the Wendigo.

It paused for a moment, its eyes scanning us curiously. It wobbled on its skinny legs and shuddered from the cold. My lips bled as they dried. We stood there for what felt like hours, waiting for the creature to do anything. We couldn’t run from it or fight it. However, it didn’t appear to want to kill us. Yet.

The head stopped turning, its gaze directed at me. Kyle and Lucy watched me, waiting for my reaction. Frozen tears had solidified against their faces.

“Why.” The Wendigo whispered, its mystical voice echoing like a divine spirit. I took a step back, startled. However, I remained silent. I wanted to know what it was about to say.

“Why do you… feel warm?” It spoke slowly, as if processing each word carefully before saying them.

“Warm?” I stuttered. The Wendigo’s fingers twitched involuntarily. It hunched over, peering at me.

“He was cold when I… recovered from him.” the Wendigo’s eyes darted towards the front door, now stained with blood. “But you… are warm.”

I tried unsuccessfully to stop myself from shaking uncontrollably. The Wendigo breathed heavily, each breath an arctic breeze. It thrust out a thin hand, slashing at me. Before my head was removed, the hand retracted, clutching onto its ribcage. Its long fingers grasped firmly on the chest, squeezing tightly. Startled, the Wendigo looked down at its arm.

“He is… resilient.” The famine spirit whispered. “Same as you.” it pointed to me, gently brushing my cheek with its claw. Something on its hand caught my eye. Right below the thumb close to the palm, it had two red splotches. Birthmarks. The same birthmarks I had.

It all made sense. My grandfather was greedy and self-centered. My parents didn’t like inviting him to family meetings. He had no interest in me. Still, I didn’t expect it to be that bad. The thing that has been pursuing me was my own grandfather.

The Wendigo stared me down. It squeezed its own neck until it collapsed. Lucy and Kyle backed away. “What…” they tried reasoning with themselves. As the Wendigo began to move once more, we ran back to town. A part of me wanted to stay and comfort what was once my grandfather, even if he was trash. I knew that it wouldn’t let me see my grandfather again.

Clarence Barkley lived his life alone. He accumulated a large amount of money and died alone. The Wendigo took advantage of his greed. Somehow, my grandfather fused with the forest spirit to become a functional entity. That’s my current theory, at least. The Wendigo was weak on its own, scrambling desperately to blend with the ecosystem as an autonomous lifeform. When it gained humanity, it yearned for more. For me.

It’s been a rough month. Every day I watch the forest, waiting to hear a whisper or scream. I wait for something to happen. The Wendigo has not appeared since. My friends haven’t showed up either, probably because I’m related to a Wendigo.",3,1754321531.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1mhgm7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mhgm7a/aita_for_not_giving_my_boyfriend_free_access_to/,AITA for not giving my boyfriend free access to my phone?,"I (25F) am very protective of my phone because of things that happened in a past relationship. My ex used to go through my phone while I was sleeping and read my private conversations with friends. I wasn’t cheating or hiding anything, but he was, and it left me feeling like my privacy didn’t exist.

When I got with my current boyfriend (28M), I told him about this pretty early on. I’ve mentioned it multiple times since, especially when he makes comments like “why do you always have your phone with you” or “what are you hiding.” Despite how uncomfortable it makes me, I’ve tried to be more relaxed. I started leaving my phone out when we’re together to show him I wasn’t hiding anything.

One day while I was sleeping, he went through my phone. He sent himself a bunch of photos and videos of me with my friends from before we were together. Most of these were from parties, which he now has a problem with. He found some explicit photos from that time and confronted me about why I had the “decency” to party and why I never sent those pictures to him. He refused to delete what he sent to himself and didn’t give my phone back until the next day.

Since then, I’ve been very uncomfortable with him touching my phone. He will randomly grab it and try to unlock it. If I’m holding it, he’ll try to snatch it out of my hand just to see how I’ll react. I stay calm because I know what he’s trying to do but it’s exhausting. It feels like a constant invasion of privacy.

It’s not about who I’m talking to. He knows all my friends, has their numbers, and speaks to them when I’m on the phone. But after what happened, I don’t trust him not to go through my conversations again or send more things to himself.

For context, we do have a dom/sub dynamic sometimes, which I’m fine with in the right moments. The problem is he tends to overdo it. Sometimes I get home from work completely drained and he immediately wants to get into that headspace. It’s not forced but sometimes I just need time to rest and not constantly be in that dynamic for him.

The most uncomfortable moment was when I was out having coffee with friends at a café called La Veen. He knew where I was, my location was on, and I had told him where I was going. He had questioned what I’d be ordering before hand and I explained that I hadn’t been there before but I’d be sure to send a photo of what I ordered- But he still showed up out of nowhere and sat at a table across from us just watching. Later he told me he wanted to see if I was behaving. I wasn’t drinking, I wasn’t partying, it was literally just coffee in the middle of the day, but apparently that wasn’t enough.

He already has my location. He has cameras in the house. He has control over almost every part of my life except my phone. And that’s the one boundary he just cannot stand not being able to cross.

At this point, it doesn’t feel like he’s asking for trust. It feels like he’s demanding total control.

So, AITA for not handing it over?

I have many guy-friends who are my homies. But they aren't ""cute"" you know, and I am not gay so I don't find them cute either ways.


Now, guys though they pretend they are cool and tough, every guy has a small mischievous kid inside them (""Pretty Little Baby :)"") and that kid needs to come out from time to time.

And the only person who can bring that kid out is a girl (Ofc the right one 💀). Sometimes I just gotta relax after office. I have a guitar and I keep myself occupied with that. Mornings, I go to gym.


Doing all that and even doing decently at workplace does make me feel satisfied, but sometimes it just becomes monotonous. Only a girl-friend can bring some twist to it.

See frankly I am not looking to get into a relationship. I just feel that I'd like to be around someone who can bring that other shade out from me, and same I could do for her.

Yeah now the typical opinion that ""A girl and a boy can't be friends"". So yes to end that debate, I'll just agree and go with that idea. That means, I am open to a relationship, but not until we are fully compatible.

This concept of girl-friend has been orchestrated by me so as to bring a mediator between a friend who is a girl and a proper GF. This would be like friends with benefits. Obviously not those kinds 💀😂, but maybe who knows 🙃. Just kidding, I don't believe in premarital stuff or a live-in kind of thing. Many of this generation might find me boring or ""unc"" but I kind of believe in one life one love philosophy and the old school kind of love.

So let's say we'd be in talking stage, if someone hits me up and we vibe. If things work out well, we can plan a few coffee/dinner dates. If they don't, then we don't need to just be back to strangers again (ofc your choice), I am great being mutually connected via social media later on, without being emotionally attached.",1,1754321045.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

Atlanta has just acquired starter Erick Fedde (5.33 ERA) from the St. Louis Cardinals, but his last 5 straight starts have resulted in a loss for his respective team – 4 losses with the Cardinals and one with the Braves. The Brewers offense has been piping hot, and every opponent in Fedde’s last 5 starts managed to get at least 5 runs past him (...even the Rockies); Milwaukee will be no exception. I’m on the Brewers to bag at least 5 here.

It's a stainless steel whirley pop with a 165rpm 12v motor attached, set on a wok burner from [outdoorstirfry.com](http://outdoorstirfry.com) I roast 400-450grams at a time to medium in 7-8 minutes, though I experiment and can easily push it slower or faster.

I have the new version of their burner shipping in that has a more traditional stove-like knob that I think I'll be able to adjust more consistently. 

Typically I use an infrared thermometer to get the pot up to 400, throw the lid on and dump the beans, then lower the heat. Once it hits 1st crack I lower the temp further. Dump in the colander and shake a lot to cool and get rid of the chaff, then dump and spread in a flat layer in the aluminum pan to help cool it quick.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Title: ""Angels vs. Rays: A Tale of Two Teams, One Moneyline, and a Lot of Shoelace Drama""**

The Los Angeles Angels (54-58) and Tampa Bay Rays (55-58) are set to collide on Monday, August 4, 2025, in a clash that’s as thrilling as watching your Uncle Joe try to parallel park. With Yusei Kikuchi toeing the rubber for the Angels and Adrian Houser doing the same for the Rays, this game hinges on whether a team can stop looking like a toddler’s art project (messy, unpredictable) and start looking like a finished product. Let’s break it down with the precision of a umpire who *finally* got his black nail polish fixed.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Numbers Game for the Slightly Less Delusional

The Angels enter this matchup with a 51.7% win rate when favored on the moneyline this season—a stat that’s about as reliable as a promises from a used car salesman. The Rays, meanwhile, have a 41.8% win rate as underdogs, which is statistically less than the chance your local barista remembers your coffee order. Both teams are clinging to the “I’m-not-quite-terrible” ledge of the standings, but the Angels’ home-field advantage (Angel Stadium’s “Party Barge in Anaheim”) gives them a slight edge.

Key players? Taylor Ward (Angels) is like a human exclamation mark—energetic but occasionally prone to overcommitting. On the Rays, Yandy Díaz is the team’s version of a Swiss Army knife: useful, unexciting, and occasionally involved in a kitchen mishap. Adrian Houser, the Rays’ starter, has the ERA of a leaky faucet, but hey, at least he’s consistent.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Shoelaces, and Dodger Drama

Recent headlines are as chaotic as a toddler’s playroom. The Rays’ recent 4-0 shutout of the Los Angeles Dodgers? A masterclass in “underdog done right.” Shohei Ohtani, back in the leadoff spot for the Dodgers, now has the pressure of a man juggling flaming chainsaws while riding a unicycle. Meanwhile, Mookie Betts, moved to second base, is slashing his way through lineups like a guy with a chainsaw in a bread bakery.

For the Angels, the news is… well, not great. Their offense is about as loud as a mime in a library. Taylor Ward’s batting average is so low, it’s practically a basement. And Yusei Kikuchi? He’s the starter who’s been compared to a “reliable umbrella in a drizzle”—effective, but not exactly a hurricane.

---

### Humorous Spin: Because Baseball Needs More Laughs

Let’s talk about Adrian Houser. The Rays’ pitcher has the control of a toddler on a tricycle—unpredictable, but somehow less terrifying when you’re not in his direct path. Meanwhile, Yusei Kikuchi is the Angels’ version of a “maybe he’ll fix it, maybe he won’t” contractor.

The Angels’ lineup? It’s like a group of people trying to assemble IKEA furniture without instructions. Nolan Schanuel is the team’s “I’ll just wing it” guy, while Zach Neto is the rookie who’s still figuring out if the ball is a toy or a weapon. On the Rays, Yandy Díaz is the anti-superstar—reliable enough to not get bench-warmed, but underwhelming enough to make you check if the game is on mute.

---

### Prediction: Who Will Win?

Statistically, the Angels’ 51.7% win rate as favorites gives them the edge, but the Rays’ 41.8% underdog success rate is the kind of “I’ll show you” energy that wins playoff series. However, the Rays’ recent shutout of the Dodgers proves their pitching staff can silence even the most star-studded lineups.

**Final Verdict:** The Rays pull off the upset, thanks to Adrian Houser’s “mystery meat” pitching and the Angels’ offense continuing to play hide-and-seek with the strike zone. The Angels’ 51.7% edge? More like 51.7% chance of a dramatic collapse in the 9th inning.

**Pick:** Tampa Bay Rays (+125) — because underdogs who shut out the Dodgers don’t need luck, they need *destiny*. And destiny smells like citrus and bad decisions.

1mhgd0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnTech/comments/1mhgd0y/does_the_best_wireless_earbuds_skullcandy_dime_3/,Does the best wireless earbuds Skullcandy Dime 3 live up to the hype?,"Testing the Skullcandy S2DCW-R740 was like inviting a small yet mighty audio companion into my daily life. These earbuds didn't initially seem like they'd pack such a punch, but day by day, they proved me wrong. Their compact size and sleek ""True Black"" finish made them incredibly portable, and they didn’t scream for attention with flashy lights or gaudy designs. While I’ve used larger, pricier headphones in the past, these little guys brought both impressive performance and convenience. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that stands out about these earbuds is their ultra-compact form factor. They fit snugly into my pocket, which is not something I can say about all wireless earbuds. The Skullcandy S2DCW-R740 didn’t feel flimsy, despite being lightweight plastic. I especially liked that the carrying case was made of fabric—it felt premium and added an extra layer of durability. Though I've accidentally dropped the case a couple of times, the earbuds survived without a scratch. The buds are simple to use, thanks to touch-control capabilities, which make pausing music or switching EQ modes a breeze.

**Sound Performance**  
I’m no audiophile, but the sound quality was unexpectedly rich. These earbuds come with three preset EQ modes, and I tested them out during different activities—a workout, a Netflix binge, and even a block of phone calls while multitasking. Each mode served its purpose well. The Stay-Aware Mode kept me conscious of my surroundings while walking my dog near traffic, and the bass-heavy profile added life to my gym playlist. Also, the dynamic drivers made sure the highs and mids weren’t drowned out, no matter the genre. You’d think earbuds in this price range wouldn’t deliver, but they genuinely hold their own.

**Upsides**  
There are several positive features that boosted the appeal of these earbuds:  

- Multipoint Pairing made it a breeze to switch between my phone and laptop automatically. This saved numerous interruptions.  
- The addition of Tile tracking technology is a lifesaver. I misplaced one of the earbuds under my car seat, and the Tile app helped me locate it quickly.  
- Lightweight and comfortable design guaranteed there was no ear fatigue, even during hours of listening.  
- 8-hour battery life in the buds themselves plus two full recharges from the case provided a total of 20 hours of playtime. It became a reliable travel companion for me.  

[Grab Skullcandy S2DCW-R740 at the best price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0cfcqvzs6/)  

**Control Options and Connectivity**  
Pairing these buds to my phone and laptop via Bluetooth 5.2 was smooth and settled within seconds. I loved the simplicity of having media control directly on the earbuds. Touch commands work as advertised—though the responsiveness could trip me up if I accidentally brushed the surfaces while adjusting the fit. Multipoint Pairing deserves special mention again. A phone call came in while I was streaming a show on my MacBook, and the earbuds switched to my phone seamlessly.  

**Negatives**  
No product is without its flaws, and while the Skullcandy S2DCW-R740 impressed me, there were a few aspects that could use improvement:  

- Lack of Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) meant I had to deal with background chatter in noisy environments like coffee shops.
- Water resistance is fine but isn’t at a high level. I didn’t feel bold enough to wear them in a heavy downpour.  
- The plastic build, though lightweight, had limited premium appeal for those who prefer high-end materials.  
- Charging speed wasn’t exactly a highlight. A full charge for the case took a little over two hours, which felt slow compared to competitors.  

**Product Rivals**  
Comparing these earbuds to others in the same category brought both perspective and appreciation for their unique features. For instance, the JBL Tune series offers warmer sound clarity but lacks the Tile tracking system, which I consider a game-changer for forgetful people like me. Apple AirPods boast superior build and ANC but come at double the price and aren’t as portable in their case size. Even the Sony WF-C500 produces marginally better lows, yet it misses out on highlighting multipoint connectivity. Skullcandy really hits a balance of affordability and intelligent features that bridge several user needs.  

**Price Performance**  
Talking about cost efficiency, I believe these little gadgets give a decent bang for the buck. Their budget-friendly design might not scream luxury, but the convenience and performance more than make up for their approachable price. I felt like I got more value than I initially expected, and the inclusion of multipoint pairing and Tile tracking added functionalities usually reserved for premium entries in the market. While pricier alternatives may bring enhanced bass or ANC, these earbuds cover everyday audio needs quite comprehensively. For anyone shopping on value, they’re worth considering.

This one might be slightly controversial. We always hear how important it is to save for the future, and that is absolutely true. But sometimes we forget that you are your most valuable investment. You cannot thrive if you are constantly afraid to spend even a little on yourself just to retire early or hit a savings goal. There is a difference between being smart with money and completely neglecting your own growth or wellbeing. This does not mean you need to drain your bank account. It just means being intentional. And once I took on that mindset, and fought against the constant guilt whenever I spent on myself, my quality of life has improved a lot.

For me personally, I chose to invest in a more luxury gym. I always struggled with consistency and gym motivation, so knowing I am spending my hard earned money, and gain benefits when I go (E.g Free smoothies, extra discounts, etc), I am more motivated to actually go, and it works. When i was signed up to a low priced commercial gym, I never went, and forgot to the point i ended up paying for 6 months without realising lol

Now, everyone is on a different boat when it comes to money, some are single mothers with kids, others are saving for weddings, and some are millionaires (must be nice), so this will mean something different to everyone. If you are going through financial struggles where you have ZERO room for monetary self-investment, there's other ways of self investment, examples of this are: Morning mediation, youtube yoga classes, journaling, learning how to say no to things that don't benefit you. If you do have some flexility, here is some ideas, for all budgets, on self investment ideas:

$

\- Coffee subscription, Payday Treat, Takeaway during period week, Weekly green juice, At home Yoga Set

$$

\- Investing in weekly/bi-weekly cleaner, Pre-Made meal delivery subscription, Cotton Rich Clothing, Yoga Classes, Teeth Whitening

$$$

\- Personal Trainer, Laser Hair Removal, ""GirlCave"" at home, Life Coach, Regular Trips, Chef preaped meals on delivery

1mhg8yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Trade_Sourcing/comments/1mhg8yo/woman_goes_furniture_shopping_in_china_and_prices/,Woman goes furniture shopping in China and prices leave her floored,"A British woman decided to travel all the way to Foshan in China in order to buy all the furniture she'd need for her future home after hearing it was cheaper than the UK.

As the USA issued new trade tariffs on products from across the world at the start of 2025, with China being hit with a 20% tariff, which was an increase from the 10% tariff it had been before, Chinese sellers took to social media to urge people to shop with them directly.

While these tariffs didn't directly affect the UK, it didn't stop British social media users to see the videos that Chinese sellers were making about being able to by luxury products to a fraction of brands' prices directly from the factories. This includes everything from designer clothes to furniture and home goods.

Shirley Bekker was one of many viewers who saw these videos on TikTok, and decided to book a spontaneous shopping trip to China in May 2025 in order to buy all the furniture she'd need for her future flat.

As she arrived in Foshan in China, a city known for its high manufacturing output to the world, having 30 towns specialised in particular industries, including furniture, machinery, and beverages, Shirley decided to document her shopping trip on TikTok to show people the big savings she was making.

While Shirley herself hadn't been convinced that travelling all the way to Foshan to buy furniture would be worth it, she quickly changed her mind when she found her 'dream' coffee table.

""It's built on a solid wood platform, real glass on top, it's really heavy, really durable, and just looks so luxe,"" she said as she showed off the table, which also included wooded geometric details under the glass.

While it looked luxurious and expensive, she revealed that she'd only paid £150 for it, saying it cost her less than her HD frontal weave.

In her next video, she shared that she'd gotten a wooden dining table for £80, as well as customised chairs to go with it that matched the luxurious sofa she'd gotten for £340. She also made sure to get lamps and art to decorate her future how with as well.

While all of these sums do add up quickly, as she got home, Shirley decided to make a presentation to share how much money she'd saved after finding similar items sold in shops around the UK.

Starting off with the £80 wooden dining table she'd bought in China, she'd found an almost identical table being sold in B&Q for £349.99. While the import costs aren't included in this comparison, Shirley saved £269.99 just from the table alone. Meanwhile, the two chairs she'd gotten for £65 each cost a whopping £990 each if she'd bought them in the UK.

Shirley continued to go through the comparisons for all the different items she'd bought, only to come to the conclusion to how much she'd save.

""So in conclusion, you flew to all the way to China with nothing but a Monzo, Google Translate, and praised hands. You ran around for six days and bought enough stuff to furnish a bedroom, balcony, renovate a bathroom, and have enough dinnerware to host the royal family""

""Had you stayed in the UK and bought all the same things, this little venture would have cost you a grand total of £21,800. But all because you took the plunge and bought it all in China instead, you spent a grand total of £3,690.56.""

While these calculations did not include the shipping costs to get her furniture from China to the UK, Shirley still saved herself a whopping £18,109.04, which will most likely be more than enough to cover the shipping costs.

Since Shirley's videos went viral, her British fans have been flocking to her to buy Chinese furniture on their behalf. Now, her orders for sourcing Chinese furniture are booked through 2026.

A new niche has emerged: some people are seizing this opportunity, relying on partners in China to help her fans, community neighbors, family, and friends purchase affordable, high-quality Chinese goods.

What are your thoughts on this? Have you also spotted new opportunities?",1,1754320621.0,China_Trade_Sourcing,0,1.0,False
1mhg8oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1mhg8oo/my_experience_with_hemorrhoid_surgery_dealing/,My experience with hemorrhoid surgery - dealing with the pain,"I thought I would share my recent experience with hemorrhoid surgery in the hope that it might help someone else know what to prepare for and help with their recovery. 

I'm a 40 year old male, generally pretty fit and healthy, but for a number of years, I developed hemorrhoids that would protrude out my rectum every time I would defecate. Most of the time they weren't particularly painful, as long as I pushed them back in after. Using toilet paper was quite irritating, and sometimes they would pop back out if they weren't pushed deeply enough to get above the sphincter. Using Vaseline/petroleum jelly as lubricant helped a lot. There were times that they would bleed quite a bit and quite irritated and painful. Dealing with them was quite an inconvenience.

I visited my GP/primary care doctor and was referred to a colorectal surgeon. She told me I had grade 3/4 hemorrhoids that were partly thrombotic, recommended surgical excision, and put me on a waiting list for the surgery. She also recommended a colonoscopy to rule out any other concerns.

A few months later, I get notified that my surgery is scheduled. I'm given instructions for ""bowel prep"" which includes fasting for about a 24 hours, and taking a preparation that will flush out my bowels. I take an uber to the hospital and a few hours later I'm put under general anesthetic for the surgery. Shortly before going under, my surgeon reminds me that this is often a very painful recovery. That did scare me some-what, but I'm glad she did, because it prepared me mentally for what was to follow. 

I wake up in recovery, feeling sleepy but comfortable with only a slight pain in my rectum. There was a dressing taped over my bum. The nurses told me I had a nerve block, presumably into the pudendal nerve. My genitals were completely numb until the next day, and I was unable to urinate for a few hours, though this wasn't really a big deal. 

I was given a prescription and instructions for a heap of medications:  
\- celecoxib, an anti-inflammatory drug  
\-metronidazole, an antibiotic  
\- psyllium oral capsules, supplementary fibre to bulk up stool  
\- endone/oxycodone IR, an opiate pain-killer  
\- paracetamol  
\- Movicol oral powder, contains macrogol 3350, which helps retain water within stool, keeping it soft  
\- coloxyl with senna tablets, the coloxyl helps retain oil within stool, keeping it soft while the senna stimulates bowel movements.

I was also instructed to have a high fiber diet and to drink plenty of water.

A friend picked me up from the hospital, took me to the pharmacy and then drove me home. The hospital won't allow surgery with general anesthesia unless you have someone to drive you home (not a taxi/uber). Feeling pretty good, I walked a few km to the supermarket for some groceries and made some dinner, took the meds as instructed and went to bed.

The following morning I wake up, have some coffee and crumpets for breakfast and shortly afterwards feel my first urge to poo, and that's where my days of misery first begin.

Nervously I crouch over the toilet, careful not to spread my cheeks too much and try to relax my bowels. The pain is excruciating. It feels like shitting razor-blades through a hole the size of a drinking straw. I'm scared that my stitches are being ripped out and I start moaning in agony. All that really comes out is some squirts of super soft poo, and it feels like there's still more backed up inside of me, but it won't come out. There's some blood, but it's not excessive. I don't dare wipe, and get into the shower to clean up, all the while gritting my teeth and wailing in agony. The pain keeps going as I feel my rectum spasming. Remembering some advice, I run a hot bath and sit inside. As soon as my arse-hole is below the waterline, I feel relief. I can not express how much of a god-send it is, having access to a bath following this kind of surgery. 

This same ritual repeats 3-4 times a day over the next few days. Each time is just as painful as the last, and taking endone an hour prior, and applying lidocaine numbing cream 30 minutes prior seemed to do nothing to reduce the pain. And each time I'd only be able to squeeze out a modest volume of very loose and super-soft stool, and it was frustrating to still feel backed-up right after bearing through that experience. Each time, I would clean up in the shower and sit in the bath until the pain was subsided. I couldn't really concentrate on anything much, and I'd mostly lie on the couch and watch tv, doom scroll or chat with friends.

I was also quite gassy. At first it was hard to tell if it was gas or poop that was about to come, but it was always gas. It would sting to fart. 

After a few days of this, and with no sign of improvement, I started consulting chatgpt and decided to change my strategy. I switched to a 'low residue' diet. With easy to digest protein, low fat and very low fiber. Things like white rice, chicken broth, angle-hair spaghetti, boiled eggs, cottage cheese, low fat greek yoghurt and canned peaches and pears. Nothing whole-grain or whole meal, no fibrous vegetables or fruit of vegetable skins. I also stopped taking the fibre suppliment and the coloxyl with senna. The next day, I felt fantastic. I didn't poo even once the whole day and could enjoy going outside in the sun. I still felt backed-up, but I had some respite from the cycles of shitting and pain of the previous four days. The gassiness had also mostly settled down. I was starting to get concerned that I might make myself constipated, which would be bad news, so that evening I resumed the movicol oral powder, while continuing the low residue diet.

The next day, I did my first solid poo. A bit \*too\* solid for my liking, with quite a bit of blood and the usual pain that took a long time to subside. That evening, this evening as I write this, I had my first \*satisfying\* poo. It bleed, and it was painful just like usual, but it was soft, well formed, and for the first time since the surgery, it felt like it all came out. I sat in the bath, and very quickly the pain was gone. It is such a relief to finally feel some progression in my recovery. I plan to continue on this low residue diet, along with once daily movicol and then slowly reintroduce more fibre over the next few days.

My advice to anyone preparing for this kind of surgery is to understand the role of the medications and supplements that you're prescribed so that you can tailor their use to your needs. For me, the coloxyl with senna in particular, was probably doing more harm than good. Prepare yourself mentally for a lot of pain. Get access to a bath. Improvise with a big plastic tub if you have to. A lot of pain is normal. Some bleeding is normal. Excessive bleeding, pus or fever is not, so get help if that happens. 

As an Australian without private health insurance, I paid about $250 for the consultation with the colorectal surgeon, the surgery was free after being on the elective surgery waiting list for a few months (waiting wasn't a problem at all), and the medications/supplements cost around $70 all up.

As the title says, I went to the dentist to have my lower right molar checked because it's been painful for over two weeks. The dentist didn't see any cavities during the check-up, so he asked me to get an x-ray to see if a wisdom tooth might be coming in.

After reviewing the x-ray, he confirmed that there's no wisdom tooth, and still believes there are no cavities. However, he's now convinced that the tooth needs to be extracted.

Just to add I don't smoke; I only drink coffee.

I grew up drinking Cuban coffee on a moka pot with espumita and this has been what I continue doing most of my life. Recently I decided to jump into buying an espresso machine (BBE)  to see if I could level up my espressos. Went and bought La Llave beans (just like the bricks I used to buy and love) and starting dialing in at a 1:2 ratio ~30seconds. Well, it’s so bitter! Even after adding sugar after. Consistency is good and eveything but the flavor is nothing like what I’m used to (been messing around with grind size after following some tutorials to no improvement). Any tips? I’m thinking of forgetting about La Llave or Bustelo beans and going for a lighter roast for my machine and stick to the brick + moka pot setup for Cuban cafecito.

-I am off work for 3 months now. First weeks I was weak but then I noticed the feeling got shallower and I had a bad conscience for not being in the office. But still I knew I couldn’t perform AT ALL right now

-then I quit my job after 2-3 months: super hard rebound for a couple days

-fallout with a good friend about a very emotional topic, after that heavy rebound, weaker for days 

-then: first time for a long long time able to go to the gym (one big exercise only), but after a week my body told me “we can’t go right now” for no apparent reason so maybe too much

-then a trip outside of the city, with a family visit, emotional, after that when I went back I went to the gym and actually landed in the hospital that evening due to high blood pressure over hours. Now quit coffee for good 

-today: made a call I dreaded for weeks now at the agency for labour (European country) where I need to get signed in to receive benefits in a couple weeks. They decide If I go with or without pay for 3 months though I got a notice from the doctor that I quit my job due to health reasons with his recommendations so I should get benefits right away, this is stressful as you might imagine, since it is not 100% given I get the benefits right away and without a hassle. 
 -> rebound again, body feels like lead.

I use to play some video game but I am even to unmotivated and weak to do that so this is how I notice it’s bad. Also I don’t really cook food for  a while now which I regularly enjoy. Plus eating a lot of carbs which I don’t do regularly.

It’s like any time I do something that is remotely taxing mentally I am super low afterwards. I am kinda scared of how long it’s supposed to be that way, my plan was to get back to making money in October but I can’t know at all if that’s going to happen.

1mhg5f6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1mhg5f6/explore_miralax_laxative_ba56800_review_is_it/,Explore MiraLAX Laxative BA56800 Review Is It Best for Gentle Constipation Relief?,"The **MiraLAX BA56800 Gentle Constipation Relief Laxative Powder** truly lives up to its reputation. Using this product over the past weeks has been a game changer in addressing occasional constipation. This laxative powder has been marketed as an osmotic laxative and not a stimulant, which piqued my curiosity. Right from the start, I noticed how smoothly it integrated into my daily routine, and it’s worth delving into the ups and downs of this popular product.

**Ease of Use**  
Mixing the powder is a breeze. All you need is the product’s cap, which has a white line indicator to measure the dosage, and 4 to 8 ounces of any beverage you prefer—coffee, juice, water, or tea. Just stir it a bit until it completely dissolves, and it’s good to go. No taste, no grit, absolutely unnoticeable in terms of flavor, which is a big plus. For someone like me who’s sensitive to strong medicinal flavors, this has been a relief—literally.

**Gentle Action Without Side Effects**  
During my testing, I was particularly impressed with how gentle its action feels on the body. Unlike some laxatives that seem to spring into action suddenly, causing cramping or bloating, MiraLAX seems to work naturally with the water in your system to hydrate and soften the stool. Over the course of 1-3 days, the effects are noticeable but not overwhelming, ensuring there’s no sudden urgency. For someone who deals with occasional constipation triggered by stress or travel, this is ideal.

[Don’t miss MiraLAX BA56800 deals—check Amazon here.](https://healthquay.com/p/b01mtpcpls/)

**Positives**  
There are several clear benefits to using MiraLAX that set it apart from alternative laxatives out there. Some of these include:  
- Dissolves completely and has no taste or grit.  
- Causes no bloating, gas, or cramps, making it gentle on sensitive stomachs.  
- Works organically with your body over 1-3 days for a gradual effect.  

**Limitations**  
However, like any product, it does come with a few limitations. Personal experience and user reviews indicate areas where it may fall short:  
- It's not a quick fix; those expecting immediate relief may be disappointed.  
- The lack of flavor might be a downside for those wanting a refreshing taste in beverages.  
- The need to mix it into liquids means it's not as convenient as tablet or capsule-based alternatives.  

**Highlights**  
What stands out most, and what I valued during usage, is its physician-recommended backing since hitting the shelves in 2007. Often, I’m hesitant to try over-the-counter solutions, but knowing MiraLAX leads its category in recommendations makes me more confident in the product’s safety. Additionally, it doesn’t induce dependency, which gives it an edge over other options prone to overuse.

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing MiraLAX to similar laxatives on the market, there are some noteworthy aspects. Competing brands often focus on stimulant formulas that act within hours, but these sometimes come with harsh side effects like severe cramping or unexpected urgency. Dulcolax, for example, offers quicker relief but doesn’t provide the same gentle, long-term solution, which might be problematic for regular users. Meanwhile, fiber-based products like Metamucil are focused on maintaining digestion rather than exclusively addressing constipation, making them more suited for prevention than immediate relief.  

MiraLAX sits comfortably between these categories, balancing effective, non-disruptive relief while still being ideal for occasional use. The finely tuned PEG 3350 composition ensures a hydration-based approach, which I didn't find with many competing options.

**Worth Every Penny**  
MiraLAX, in my opinion, provides excellent value for its features. You’re not just getting a laxative; you’re investing in gentle, science-backed relief free from common irritants like sugar, gluten, and preservatives. Comparing it to pricier, less effective alternatives, this product delivers consistent results without unnecessary additives. That kind of reliability is worth every penny, especially for anyone who factors quality and ease of use into their purchasing decisions.

But honestly, those things weren’t barriers in my eyes. What mattered was how naturally we connected.

This wasn’t the kind of “love” you show off online or build through daily texting or Instagram stories. Our connection was built slowly, through real conversations, shared routines, subtle moments. Things that never made it to photos, but felt more real than anything I’d experienced.

She is incredibly intelligent, deep, and thoughtful. One thing I really admired about her, she reads. A lot. And not just random books, thoughtful, meaningful ones. I’ve rarely seen anyone in our generation read the way she does. And those books? They were good. Really good. I knew just by the way she talked about them, and how they shaped her.

We also shared so many strange coincidences, same favorite movies, same blood group, even our postal PIN codes are just one digit apart despite living nearly 300 kilometers away from each other. Actually we were studying in the university together. Our personalities  eerily similar. We react the same way to stress, to joy, to grief. Sometimes, we didn’t even need to speak. I could just feel when something was wrong with her  and somehow, I was usually right.

When she was sick or anxious or tired, I was always there. Not because she asked, but because I couldn’t stay away. I reminded her about her medicines, brought her water, or just accompanied her to the shop or canteen without her even asking. And later, when she felt better, she’d softly say, “I really needed that. Thank you.” Those moments were enough for me.

There’s one memory I’ll never forget. After class one day, I promised myself I wouldn’t call her. She had seemed a bit off, and I didn’t want to annoy her. But I couldn’t stop myself. I called. She answered, said she was outside the campus, and would call me back. When she didn’t call after a while, I got worried. Eventually she did , said she’d met her local guardian unexpectedly, and that’s why she didn’t pick up earlier. She told me she was at the shop just outside the gate.

But we misunderstood each other. I went the wrong way, she was on the other side. I called her, confused, and she sounded irritated. I realized she was angry, and I told her I’d come to her. When I finally saw her walking with a big bag, she looked so cute - especially in that annoyed, slightly angry mood. She walked past me , not saying a word, just marching ahead. I followed, asking what had happened. She didn’t respond. I said, “Okay fine, don’t tell me - but I’ll still walk with you.” Eventually, when she saw how confused and anxious I looked, she smiled. And then we got coffee. Everyone walking past us on the road looked like they were watching a romantic scene in a movie. And honestly? It felt like one.

I’ve seen girls in my university - expressive, confident, physically affectionate. That’s perfectly fine, and I respect them. But she was different. She’s not touchy or loud about emotions. She has very few friends - just two from school, a few in university including me. She once told me after watching a couple being romantic that they looked “cringe”, and she’d even give such couples funny nicknames. She wasn’t into the typical public display of affection, and I loved that about her. It made everything feel more real, more personal - like what we had didn’t need to be broadcast.

But despite all this, she doesn’t feel the same. She’s still single, yet... she doesn’t choose me. I can feel myself losing control over my mind lately. I think about her constantly - every minute, every hour, trying to understand what went wrong when I did everything I could. I never asked for much, I never even confessed loudly. I just stayed. I was there , in the background, in the quiet, in every detail she overlooked but later thanked me for.

It hurts more than I can explain. I see people around me , even those who put in half the effort, people who don't value the ones they’re with and still they’re in relationships. They break up, move on, love again. I know people say ""you’ll find someone better,"" but I won’t. Not because I can’t, but because I don’t want to. I cannot give this space in my heart to anyone else.

Everyone says time will heal. But it won’t. Not this. I know myself. Even if I marry someone someday, I’ll never be able to love them fully. And I don’t want to ruin someone else’s life because I’m stuck loving someone who never chose me. So I’d rather stay alone.

We still talk, just like before. On the surface, nothing seems broken. But I can feel that she doesn’t see this the way I do, and that realization is quietly tearing me apart. I love her deeply. I want a future with her. She’s not like others - she’s private, grounded, even used to joke about how couples behave, calling them cringe and giving them names. But now this uncertainty is eating me up inside. I’m scared of losing her completely, and I don’t know how to live with that fear every day.

I’m writing this for advice. I think about her all day. I feel like I’m losing control over my mind - it’s just her, constantly. I haven't distanced myself or stopped talking to her, because even the smallest interactions feel important. But deep inside, I know this is affecting me badly. If anyone has ever managed to move forward from something like this - not by cutting someone off, but by finding peace without losing them - I really need to know how. Because I can’t go on like this much longer.",1,1754320002.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False
1mhfyoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1mhfyoh/i_messed_up_big_time_venti_rant/,I messed up big time venti rant,"Hi guys. I literally don't know how to explain my shift from Sunday because it was that bad. But I'll try.

We had no water. Expresso machines were not working. Both of them, I might add. The machine to make pike and other coffees wasn't working. The hot water wasn't working. I couldn't make teas. I could make only Frappuccino’s and our refreshers. I was the only one up there and we were open. Water came on eventually but the machine wouldn't work until my manger came and fixed it. One expresso machine I believe was working. 

Then we got busy and it was only two of us, until 11 when someone came in. Then 12 for the next person so four people total today.

My manager brought food up. I believe at this time it was only maybe us two. I was supposed to put it away but due to a long line I wasn't able to. So turns out our DM came. I only knew of a name and not face. 

The DM checked the food, it wasn't good anymore. Had to be thrown out. But the pastries were fine. Then my manager came to me and said ""You got me in trouble."" Which in no way was my intention but we literally had no one. It sucks because that day was a blur and I really don't remember much.

She has to talk to me. Was supposed to happen Sunday, I waited but couldn't wait any longer due to my ride. Friday is my next shift and because I'm in school my schedule is set for Friday, Saturday and Sundays. I'm so anxious about this talk because we had a meeting about following what managers said. I know I didn't but I tried starting on it and doing customers until the line got too long, I'm pretty sure. I'm ready to accept my consequences which from the meeting can range from tips being held and cut hours until behavior changes. I completely understand and just want to get the talk over with. 

But it's eating me up. I just wanted to cry all day that shift. Even now I do because it sucks anticipating this talk. I just don't want to be fired or anything like that. It pays for my school supplies I need. I'm just worried I will be or something. That was was just awful and we were for sure understaffed. I'm stressed from it and I keep saying it'll get better because I just want it to get better. 

I guess if you guys know anything that could happen please let me know. I'm worried, anxious and stressed.",5,1754319977.0,starbucksbaristas,8,1.0,False
1mhfydy,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1mhfydy/why_is_the_best_electric_kettle_zwilling_enfinigy/,Why is the best electric kettle ZWILLING Enfinigy worth your money,"Testing out the ZWILLING 53103-200 kettle in my kitchen over the past few weeks has been an unexpectedly enjoyable experience. Right from unboxing this sleek-looking electric kettle, it was clear that it combines sophistication with practicality. The brushed silver finish lends it a modern touch, while the glass body adds an element of elegance to any countertop. Personally, I’m someone who appreciates both design and utility in my kitchen appliances, and this kettle strikes that balance quite well. However, as with any product, there are a few aspects to keep in mind if you’re considering adding it to your arsenal.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This kettle is genuinely a beauty to behold. Crafted with borosilicate glass, it feels sturdy and has better resistance to thermal damage than most kettles I’ve used before. This particular feature resonated with me since I once shattered a lesser-quality glass kettle by pouring boiling water too quickly. Plus, the double-sided measuring line makes it simple to fill it just right, whether you’re making a single cup of tea or enough for company. At 1.7 liters, it has plenty of capacity for my household. I noticed the stainless-steel steeper is another thoughtful touch. It lets me prepare tea directly in the kettle, and the steeping timer is genuinely a game changer for tea enthusiasts like me who despise over-brewed tea.

**Ease of Use and Functions**  
Using this electric kettle felt like tapping into a bit of luxury between my otherwise chaotic mornings. The six preset temperature controls and tea timer provide more flexibility than most competitors. Whether I was heating water for my green tea at a precise 175°F or opting for hotter water for black tea, it consistently delivered the perfect temperature. The settings are intuitive, and switching between them took no effort. The keep-warm function, which holds the temperature for 30 minutes, became surprisingly handy on the days when I lost track of time—though my coffee-loving spouse pointed out that the feature isn’t groundbreaking for them. If you’re a multitasker, like me, this option alone might win you over.

**Pros**  
- Constructed using durable borosilicate glass  
- Includes a practical stainless-steel tea steeper  
- Convenient six preset temperature options  
- Thirty-minute keep-warm functionality  
- Excellent capacity for households or office settings  

[Ready to buy ZWILLING 53103-200? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b099gpcfmw/)

**Performance and Capabilities**  
One of the first things I tested was how quickly it heats water, and I wasn’t disappointed. The 1,500-watt power ensures water boils rapidly, even when I filled it to the max marker for 14 cups. I timed it against a conventional stovetop kettle, and the results weren’t even close. Additionally, the base’s cord storage keeps my countertop neat, which matters more to me than I’d like to admit. However, it isn’t whisper-quiet in operation. Though it doesn’t screech, the sound may be mildly noticeable in quieter settings. 

**Drawbacks**  
- Slightly pricier compared to other basic options  
- Noise levels during boiling could be improved  
- Glass design requires extra care to avoid smudges  

**Target User and Suitability**  
This kettle is ideal for someone like me—an enthusiastic tea drinker or minimalist who values precision and style in their kitchen gear. It’s also well-suited for households with diverse hot beverage needs, as its adjustable temperature control caters to everything from herbal teas to a perfect French press. My elderly mother, visiting recently, commented on its ergonomically designed handle, which made lifting and pouring easier for her weak grip.

**Competing Products**  
In comparison, traditional all-metal kettles like those from Breville or KitchenAid feel more robust but lack the aesthetic elegance this kettle provides. Breville’s Smart Kettle Pro comes with a similar set of temperature adjustment features but is noticeably bulkier and a bit more expensive. On the other hand, basic electric kettles from Hamilton Beach feel utilitarian but require manual guesswork for temperature control. For me, the ZWILLING kettle undeniably balances functionality, style, and features better than many of its counterparts.

**Quality for Price**  
Although this kettle comes with a higher price tag, the combination of its durable glass design, advanced temperature control, and elegant aesthetic justifies the investment. Instead of replacing cheap kettles every couple of years, this one feels like it’s built to last longer while enhancing your tea or coffee brewing ritual with its advanced features. Spending a bit more for this kind of reliability and utility feels like smart spending in the long run.

# Best iPhone SE Wallet case 2025: Slim & protective!

The iPhone SE, known for its compact design and powerful performance, remains a popular choice for users who prefer a smaller form factor. However,the need for protection and the desire to declutter makes a wallet case an essential accessory. Finding the perfect balance between slimness, protection, and functionality can be challenging. This review focuses on the best iPhone SE wallet cases available in 2025, prioritizing these key factors to help you make an informed decision.

[[Explore Top Rated iphone se wallet case on Amazon.]](https://news.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=iphone se wallet case)

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal iPhone SE wallet case should offer a secure fit, adequate card storage, and reliable protection against everyday bumps and scratches. The materials used and the overall design greatly influence these aspects.

**Material Quality:** The materials used in an iPhone SE wallet case considerably impact its durability and feel. Premium leather,both genuine and PU,is common for a luxurious look and feel.TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) or polycarbonate are often used for the inner shell to provide impact resistance and a secure grip on the phone. The stitching quality and hardware (like magnetic clasps) must also be considered for longevity.

**Card Storage Capacity:** The number of cards a wallet case can hold is a crucial factor for many users. The capacity typically ranges from 2 to 5 cards, but the accessibility and security of these cards are just as notable. Some cases offer RFID-blocking technology to protect against electronic theft, a valuable feature in today's digital world.

**Drop Protection:** While not designed for extreme drops, a good wallet case should offer reasonable protection against accidental falls. Look for cases with reinforced corners, raised edges around the screen and camera, and a shock-absorbent inner layer. The thickness of the case frequently enough correlates with its drop protection capabilities, but the design must maintain a slim profile.**Closure Mechanism:** The closure mechanism is essential for keeping the case securely closed and protecting the phone's screen. Magnetic clasps are the most common, offering a convenient and relatively secure closure. However, the strength of the magnet is vital; a weak magnet may not hold the case closed effectively, while an overly strong magnet could perhaps interfere with the phone's functionality.

**Stand Functionality:** Some wallet cases incorporate a stand function, allowing users to prop up their iPhone SE for hands-free viewing of videos or video calls. this feature typically involves folding the case in a specific way to create a stable stand. the stability and viewing angle offered by the stand can vary significantly between different cases.

Key features of the best iPhone SE wallet cases in 2025 include:

* Slim and lightweight design
* Secure card storage with RFID protection
* Durable materials for long-lasting use
* Convenient stand functionality
* Reliable drop protection

## Core Benefits

Using an iPhone SE wallet case offers several practical benefits that streamline your daily life and protect your device.

**Reduced Bulk:** One of the most significant advantages of a wallet case is its ability to consolidate your phone and essential cards into a single, convenient package. This eliminates the need to carry a separate wallet, reducing bulk in your pockets or bag and simplifying your everyday carry.

**Enhanced Protection:** A wallet case provides a layer of protection against scratches, bumps, and minor drops. The wraparound design shields the phone's screen and back from damage, while the card slots often add an extra layer of cushioning. This can significantly extend the life of your iPhone SE.

**Improved Convenience:** Having your phone and essential cards readily accessible in one place streamlines transactions and simplifies your daily routine. Whether you're paying for coffee, boarding a train, or simply need to show your ID, everything you need is conveniently at your fingertips.

**Theft Deterrence:** A wallet case can act as a deterrent to theft, as it makes it more tough for someone to quickly snatch your phone and wallet separately. The all-in-one design increases the chances that a potential thief will be noticed, reducing the risk of theft.

**Stylish Appearance:** Many wallet cases are designed with aesthetics in mind, offering a range of colors, materials, and finishes to complement your personal style. They can enhance the overall look of your iPhone SE, adding a touch of sophistication and personalization.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions can help clarify any uncertainties and provide valuable insights into using an iPhone SE wallet case.

**Will a wallet case add significant bulk to my iPhone SE?**
While a wallet case will inevitably add some bulk compared to a naked iPhone SE, the best ones are designed to be as slim as possible. Look for cases that use thin, lightweight materials and minimize the number of card slots. Ultimately, the added convenience and protection often outweigh the slight increase in size.

**Does storing cards near my iPhone SE damage the phone or the cards?**
Modern iPhones are designed to be resistant to interference from credit cards and other magnetic stripe cards. However, it's generally recommended to use a wallet case that incorporates RFID-blocking technology to protect your cards from electronic theft. This technology creates a shield that prevents unauthorized scanning of your card information.

**How do I clean and maintain my iPhone SE wallet case?**
The cleaning and maintenance of your wallet case depend on the material it's made from. Leather cases should be treated with a leather cleaner and conditioner to prevent drying and cracking. TPU or polycarbonate cases can be cleaned with a damp cloth and mild soap. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the case.

**What happens if my wallet case breaks or wears out?**
The lifespan of a wallet case depends on the quality of the materials and the frequency of use. Most reputable manufacturers offer a warranty that covers defects in materials and workmanship. If your case breaks or wears out prematurely, contact the manufacturer to inquire about a replacement or repair.

1mhfxzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1mhfxzb/why_do_i_seemingly_feel_low_blood_sugar_while/,Why do I seemingly feel low blood sugar while driving but not while taking the train home from work?,"My Info: 30 year old caucasian male, 173 cm height, 70 kg weight, average build. No known preexisting conditions in adulthood, no regular medication

To preface, I am going to remedy it tomorrow by eating something before I drive home and I have scheduled a doctors appointment already.

Now, this has happened twice before this year, it hasn't happened before. Both times while driving home from work. It didn't happen while driving home for 2 hours from a festival. At first I have attributed it to high summer temps and not drinking enough water. But today it happened again, even though I had enough water to drink and it's a warm (24°C) cloudy day today.

I usually take the train to and from work and I have an approx 1km walk to the station both from home and work. I have never had any difficulties, even with walking in the blistering summer sun. I do have lunch at the work lunchroom, but the portions are depressingly small. 

Now, today when I had my car and was driving, my pulse started steadily rising, breathing went shallow (i tried to remedy that by manually breathing deep through my mouth, to no effect) and my arms strated tingling. I started feeling a bit woozy and lightheaded so I stopped and got out. Moving around helped a bit, but not much. After some thought, took two sugar packets, leftover from a coffee, poured them into my mouth and drank some water. I was soon feeling much better, not great but good enough to drive home, where, after I ate lunch, I feel completelly fine. 

Now, I attribute this to low blood sugar. But why does it happen only while driving and not when I take the train and walk to the station? 

Again, I will be taking measures to ensure this doesnt happen again (eating something before driving) and I will be seeing my doctor soon.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Toronto Blue Jays vs. Colorado Rockies: A Humorous Prediction for August 5, 2025**

**The Setup:**  
The Toronto Blue Jays (-200) roll into Coors Field to face the Colorado Rockies (+150), a team that’s been so bad this season, their pitching staff might’ve accidentally invented a new type of ""relief."" Eric Lauer (2.68 ERA) takes the mound for Toronto, while the Rockies counter with Tanner Gordon (4.85 ERA), who’s as trustworthy as a broken sprinkler system.

**Why the Jays Win:**

* **Lauer vs. Gordon:** Lauer’s ERA is almost half of Gordon’s. That’s like comparing a finely tuned espresso machine to a coffee mug that’s seen better days. The Rockies’ offense (28th in MLB in runs) can’t touch Eric Lauer, who’s been as dominant as a math teacher in a game of Jeopardy.
* **Offense Overload:** Toronto’s offense (8th in MLB) averages 4.7 runs per game. The Rockies? A paltry 3.8. The Jays’ Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (16 HRs, 58 RBI) is a one-man wrecking crew, while the Rockies’ Hunter Goodman (21 HRs) is their only hope, but even he can’t carry a team that’s hitting .217 as a unit.

**Player Props to Watch:**

* **VGJr. for Doubles:** Guerrero’s implied probability for a double is 33.3% (10/30). Bet he’s doubling up the Rockies’ defense.
* **Gordon’s Meltdown:** Gordo

I had my machine dialed to the point it produced a shot that I didn’t notice as either bitter/burnt/sour in my homemade lattes for months. The flavor was on par with what I would pay for in a coffee shop. Something changed in the last month or two (maybe I bumped a setting) but now I notice the espresso is bitter, watery, and also burnt? It has become undrinkable. The crema still appears golden brown, maybe a little thinner than it used to be, but the espresso looks very dark brown and watery. 

I use Illy espresso beans, grind size ~5, with my grind amount set to 2 ticks beyond the middle setting (towards “more”).

1mhfscs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_VideoGenerator/comments/1mhfscs/why_most_ai_video_looks_obviously_fake_and_5_ways/,Why most AI video looks obviously fake (and 5 ways to fix it),"this is a 9longer one but will help you a lot if you are into ai vide generation, will also save you a lot of money --  there are specific tells that scream “ai video” to viewers here’s how to avoid them

After generating hundreds of videos and analyzing what makes some feel authentic vs obviously artificial, I identified the main culprits and solutions.

**The obvious AI tells:**

**Perfect everything syndrome** \- AI tends toward idealized versions **Uncanny valley faces** \- Almost-but-not-quite-right human expressions

**Impossible physics** \- Objects that don’t follow real-world rules **Too-smooth movement** \- Motion that’s too perfect to be real **Floating elements** \- Limbs, objects that don’t connect properly

**Tell #1: Perfect everything syndrome**

**The problem:** AI generates idealized versions - perfect skin, perfect lighting, perfect composition

**The fix:** Add intentional imperfections

    Instead of: ""Beautiful woman with perfect makeup""
    Use: ""Woman with slight asymmetrical smile, small scar above left eyebrow, natural skin texture""
    

**Tell #2: Uncanny valley faces**

**The problem:** Human faces that are almost right but feel off

**The fix:** Either go full realistic or embrace stylization

    Realistic approach: ""Documentary style, natural expressions, candid moments""
    Stylized approach: ""Artistic interpretation, painterly style, non-photorealistic""
    

**Tell #3: Impossible physics**

**The problem:** Clothing, hair, objects that move wrong

**The fix:** Add physics references and constraints

    ""Hair affected by wind direction, clothing drapes naturally, objects follow gravity""
    

**Tell #4: Too-smooth movement**

**The problem:** Motion that’s too perfect, lacks natural variation

**The fix:** Add natural imperfections to movement

    ""Handheld camera with slight shake, natural walking rhythm, organic movement patterns""
    

**Tell #5: Floating elements**

**The problem:** Limbs, objects that don’t connect properly to bodies/surfaces

**The fix:** Use negative prompts and positioning specifics

    ""--no floating limbs --no disconnected elements"" + ""hands gripping steering wheel, feet planted on ground""
    

**Authentication techniques that work:**

**Environmental storytelling:**

    Instead of: ""Person in room""
    Use: ""Person in lived-in apartment, coffee stains on table, unmade bed visible, personal items scattered""
    

**Practical lighting references:**

    Instead of: ""Perfect lighting""
    Use: ""Single window light, overcast day"" or ""Harsh fluorescent office lighting""
    

**Camera imperfections:**

    ""Shot on iPhone 15 Pro, slight camera shake, natural focus hunting""
    

**Real-world audio integration:**

    ""Audio: distant traffic, air conditioning hum, papers rustling, natural room tone""
    

**Platform-specific authenticity:**

**TikTok authenticity:**

* Embrace phone-shot aesthetic
* Add intentional vertical framing
* Include trending audio compatibility cues
* Make it feel user-generated, not professional

**Instagram authenticity:**

* Focus on authentic moments, not posed perfection
* Natural lighting situations
* Candid expressions and interactions
* Real-world locations with character

**YouTube authenticity:**

* Slight production value but maintain natural feel
* Educational or documentary approach
* Behind-the-scenes elements
* Human narrator/context

**The “shot on iPhone” trick:**

AI handles smartphone aesthetics really well:

    ""Shot on iPhone 15 Pro, natural lighting, slight camera shake, portrait mode depth""
    

Often produces more authentic results than “professional cinema camera” prompts.

**Color grading for authenticity:**

**Avoid:**

* Over-saturated, perfect colors
* Hollywood teal and orange (unless specifically referenced)
* Too much contrast

**Use:**

* Slightly desaturated colors
* Real film stock references: “Kodak Vision3 color profile”
* Natural color temperature variations

**Movement authenticity:**

**Natural camera movement:**

    ""Handheld documentary style, natural camera operator breathing, slight focus adjustments""
    

**Organic subject movement:**

    ""Natural walking rhythm, unconscious hand gestures, authentic human timing""
    

**Environmental interaction:**

    ""Subject naturally interacting with environment, realistic cause and effect""
    

**Testing authenticity:**

Show your video to people without context:

* Do they immediately know it’s AI?
* What specifically makes it feel artificial?
* Does it hold up on second viewing?

**The authenticity balance:**

**Too realistic:** Uncanny valley effect, feels creepy **Too stylized:** Obviously artificial but acceptable **Sweet spot:** Clearly AI but feels natural and engaging

**Cost-effective authenticity testing:**

Authenticity optimization requires testing multiple approaches for same concept.

Using [these guys](https://dayyan.xyz/video) for authenticity testing since Google’s direct pricing makes this iterative approach expensive.

**Common authenticity mistakes:**

**Over-processing:** Adding effects thinking it improves realism **Perfectionist trap:** Trying to make AI indistinguishable from reality **Generic prompting:** Using vague terms instead of specific authentic details **Ignoring physics:** Not considering real-world constraints

**Authenticity success indicators:**

✓ **Immediate believability** \- Doesn’t trigger “fake” response ✓ **Natural imperfections** \- Small flaws that feel realistic ✓ **Environmental coherence** \- Everything fits together logically ✓ **Movement quality** \- Natural timing and rhythm ✓ **Lighting authenticity** \- Realistic light sources and shadows

**The paradigm shift:**

From: “How can I make this AI video look real?” To: “How can I make this AI video feel authentic while being clearly AI?”

**Advanced authenticity techniques:**

**Contextual details:** Add specific, realistic details that ground the scene in reality

**Emotional authenticity:** Focus on genuine human emotions and expressions

**Cultural accuracy:** Ensure cultural elements are respectfully and accurately represented

**Temporal consistency:** Maintain consistent lighting, shadows, and physics throughout

**The counterintuitive truth:**

Sometimes making AI video technically “worse” makes it feel more authentic. Slight imperfections, natural lighting variations, and organic movement often improve perceived authenticity.

**Building authenticity libraries:**

Document authentic-feeling approaches:

* Lighting setups that feel natural
* Movement patterns that work well
* Environmental details that add realism
* Color grading approaches that avoid AI tells

Authenticity is about creating content that feels natural and engaging, not about fooling people into thinking AI content is real.",1,1754319606.0,AI_VideoGenerator,0,1.0,False
1mhfqfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1mhfqfu/my_familys_house_is_always_disgusting_and_i_dont/,My family’s house is always disgusting and I don’t know what to do anymore,"I hope I can explain this in a way that makes sense I’m a teenager I live with my mom and little brother (our dad died four years ago)we live in a smaller sized house with two dogs and a cat, I don’t really know how to put this so I’ll just say our house is always disgusting I’m the only one who attempts to clean it or keep it clean. My mom works all the time and I know she’s probably tired but her habits are what’s most responsible for the house being borderline unlivable. She’s always had a shopping problem but after my dad died it got so much worse, she’s always getting new decorations we don’t have space for, she goes all out for every holiday buys new decorations every year even though we have literally no place to store them, we don’t even have anywhere to put our Christmas tree, during the year the box sits in our kitchen she buys new decorations every. single. year. And when she’s done she either just throws them away or packs them in boxes and leaves them outside in our backyard where the weather inevitably ruins them and then she just buys new ones, the second problem is her soda issue both her and my brother barley drink anything but coke and they leave their usually half full cans everywhere stacking them on the kitchen counters rendering them unusable, piling them coffee table where the dog knows them over they attract bugs and the sheer amount of cans everywhere means there’s barley any space to put anything. Another issue is the rotten food she rarely ever cooks but when she does she just leaves whatever she made in the stove to rot. I can’t count how many times I’ve had to scoop moldy ravioli into a garbage bag after she told me she’d clean it and didn’t, and when she’s done with her food she just puts her dishes in the sink usually with food STILL ON THEM so our sink is filled with dishes with old food in them, 
I try to tell her to rake her food off the plate before she puts it in the sink but she just doesn’t listen to me, when the sink is full she’ll just put the dirty dishes on the counter, when I say the counter tops are unusable due to the cans and dirty plates and bowls I mean it, Because of this we often have bug problems my mother will spray the kitchen with ant poison but they’ll just keep coming back if you leave food out so I don’t understand the point. 

Her biggest issue is with her animals, she loves dogs but she never takes care of them when she gets them,a few months after my dad died she got a new dog, we already had one but she said she wanted another big dog for security, she told me she expected me to take care of the dog while she was at work since I was always at home due to being homeschooled at the time we hadn’t agreed to this she bought the dog without me knowing, she said that I should take it out and make sure it doesn’t use the bathroom in the floor, I told her that I was still really depressed after what happened to my dad and I didn’t think I could handle taking care of a dog since I was barley able to get out of bed, so she ended up just keeping the dog in a kennel outside in the summer, we live in the American south is gets extremely hot here in the summer I felt so guilty seeing the dog suffer outside I ended up taking it inside and just taking care of it myself.
 after a few years our old dog died and she got another one a small Mini dachshund, by this time I had started back going to school so I didn’t have to time to watch this one, and she didn’t either so she just…let it shit in the floor. The hoses constantly smelled I told her that I wasn’t going to clean up after it since I didn’t ask for the dog but I ended up relenting and cleaning it just like I do for everything else in the house I felt so embarrassed about the filth we lived in, she never ended up training it, eventually I blew up at her about it telling her the dog was two years old and still not house broken and that she need to train it, she never ended up training it her solution to this problem was to just leave it outside, the dog has only been an inside dog for most of its life so it wasn’t scared of the road it died from being run over soon after, I made her promise to never got another dog, a month ago she got another dog, looking at it makes me feel sick I feel so guilty for what happened to our dachshund and I feel like we’ve betrayed him somehow by just replacing him with another dog,I tried to talk her out of buying the dog but she told me that she would train it even thought she works all the time, she told me the dog would be her responsibility but the thing is when she’s not home it becomes my responsibility, I have to take it out and clean up after it and I hate it, I feel like she thinks she can just walk all over me like she can live like a pig and I have to deal with it I have to clean it or else it just doesn’t get cleaned, when she cooks something I have to clean up after her, I have to wash the dishes so the sink doesn’t pile up and the rotten food doesn’t attract bugs I have to do everything and it’s driving me mad I hate living like this it’s fucking embarrassing, it’s embarrassing my 40 year old mother doesn’t know how to rake her food our before putting her dishes in the sink it’s embarrassing my little brother screams and cusses at me when I ask him to throw his Pepsi cans away. My brother refuses to clean up after himself if you ask him to pick up his toys he’ll just outright say no, my mom doesn’t do anything about it she enables his bad behavior, I threatened to throw his toys away if he didn’t get them out of the living room floor and he screamed at me saying he’d beat me up he’s 7 and acts like a complete psychopath, he’s the stereotypical iPad kid except with a phone, he cusses and makes inappropriate jokes about things a child shouldn’t know, he’s extremely attached to his phone he doesn’t even want to get up to get himself food he just yells at me or our mom to do it, if you try to take his phone away he has a complete meltdown screaming cussing threatening to kill you it’s ridiculous I feel so bad for him because I know it’s not his fault, he should be being raised by his parents instead of an iPhone, I feel like this post is more venting about my family than the house problem but I’m just so frustrated I need to get it all out I’m sorry if the post doesn’t make sense I’m not good at explaining things and I’m typing it hastily on my phone.",3,1754319485.0,venting,7,1.0,False
1mhfpvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1mhfpvc/explore_the_best_coffee_maker_keurig_ksupreme_and/,Explore the Best Coffee Maker Keurig K-Supreme and Is It Worth It,"You know that feeling when you’re on a mission for the perfect cup of coffee, and you think you’ve found “the one”? That's exactly what came to mind when I got my hands on the Keurig K-Supreme coffee maker. After weeks of testing it, I’ll admit, it’s pretty impressive, but like every product, it’s not without a few quirks. Here’s my honest take on this single-serve coffee brewer.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The Keurig K-Supreme doesn’t scream “industrial coffee shop,” but it definitely has a sleek, modern vibe that fits well in most kitchens. It’s not overly bulky, which is a sigh of relief for those of us with limited counter space. The dual-position reservoir is a game-changer for someone like me. You can move it to the side or back, depending on how your countertop is laid out—pure genius. The removable reservoir makes refills simple and mess-free, which my chaotic mornings appreciate.  

**Performance and Brewing Technology**  
Let’s talk about the coffee itself because, well, that’s the point, right? With its MultiStream Technology, this machine does a great job of extracting flavor and aroma from the K-cups. I tested it with a variety of pods, and the consistency blew me away. Strong, bold, or even iced coffee—this machine handles it all like a champ. If you like customization, the “strong brew” setting is particularly handy. It adds a little more punch to your morning coffee, though don’t expect espresso-level intensity because it’s still Keurig, after all.  

[Check Keurig K-Supreme Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://maisea.com/p/b08gm76wm8/)  

**Ease of Use**  
If you’re someone who avoids overly complicated gadgets, this coffee maker will feel like a warm hug. It’s practically intuitive; just pop in a pod, select your brew size, and hit go. In less than two minutes, your coffee is piping hot and ready to sip. The multiple brew sizes (6, 8, 10, or 12 ounces) give you some decent flexibility. Personally, I’ve been using the 8-ounce setting for a no-fuss, perfect-sized cup that doesn’t require babysitting.

**Highlights**  
- MultiStream Technology that really enhances coffee flavor.  
- Flexible 6 to 12-ounce brew sizes to customize your cup.  
- Removable dual-position reservoir makes it adaptable to tighter kitchen setups.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Although the strong brew feature is decent, heavy coffee drinkers might find it lacks that real kick.  
- The iced coffee setting felt a little underwhelming, as it didn’t chill the coffee as effectively as I hoped—it’s more like brewing a hot coffee that you then pour over ice.  
- It only works with K-cups, so if you’re a fan of using your own ground coffee, you’d need an additional reusable K-cup accessory.

**Noise Levels**  
Let’s face it—the sound of a coffee machine is usually just part of life’s background noise, but the Keurig K-Supreme has a slight downside here. While it’s definitely not deafening, the brewing process isn’t whisper-quiet either. If you’re brewing early mornings before everyone else is awake, just know that the machine may announce itself to the household.

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to other single-serve coffee makers like the Nespresso Vertuo or even previous Keurig models, this one stands out with its MultiStream Technology. The Nespresso, though, does edge out on richness if you’re a die-hard espresso fan. On the flip side, older Keurigs might brew a basic cup, but they don’t even come close to the versatility of this one. Though be warned—Nespresso pods are pricier, so if you want affordability with decent quality, the K-Supreme might just win your heart.  

**Smart Spending**  
Now, about whether it’s worth the cost. For someone who enjoys a quality yet convenient cup of coffee without venturing into gourmet-level expenses, this machine is a solid choice. Its performance stacks up well against similarly priced rivals, and the added convenience features like the dual-reservoir design do sweeten the deal. It feels like money well spent for what you’re getting, even if it’s not groundbreaking coffee tech.

1mhfnik,https://www.reddit.com/r/LondonTravel/comments/1mhfnik/help_sanity_check_my_final_itinerary_before_i/,Help sanity check my final itinerary before I start booking things?,"Hi everyone! So for a bit of context my family and I (5 adults) are coming to London/Europe for the first time later this year for our first major holiday ever, which is going to be so much fun!

Our first stop is London and I've been putting together an itinerary for our time there, but I want to make sure it looks good before we start buying tickets for the activities we want to do. For reference, we're staying in an airbnb out in White City, and our plane lands into Heathrow in mid-late October. 

Day 1 - land into London. Nothing planned this day - our plane is meant to land at 8am, so we're going to head over to the area of our airbnb to try and store our luggage until we can check in. I'm thinking Westfield - it's a bit more expensive than some of the storage hero or stasher places, but it gives us a chance to go to the shops to buy anything we inevitably forget, as well as a coffee and snack if we need it. Once that's done, we're going to go to somewhere chill like Hyde Park. We'll relax and wander around for a while, and eventually have lunch. We may make our way towards Buckingham Palace/the river for a walk, but depends how tired we are. We'll go check into our airbnb, then find somewhere close by for dinner before heading to bed

Day 2 - Harry Potter Studio Tour. Since it's our first international trip, I don't know how tired we'll be, so we don't want to book anything too early. We'll aim to get to the studio around 1-2, which will give us time to naturally have some breakfast and lunch before heading over. Nothing else planned this day.

Day 3 - rest day, nothing planned. We've had times on previous holidays when there's been too much packed into a single day, so we decided to schedule in rest days to avoid that. Maybe we'll go walk along the Thames and see the attractions or wander around the city and check out some castles, or eat some delicious food or go in a random direction for a while, or sleep in all day. Nothing planned, and we'll just wing it for today

Day 4 - see the Changing of the Guard, walk through St James Park, then head to Borough Market for lunch, and finally head to Westminster Abbey for an afternoon tour. Nothing planned for the evening

Day 5 - Kew Gardens in the morning, then we'll head to Abbey Road, and finish the night off with a River Thames cruise after the sun has set. We'll have dinner somewhere nearby before heading home

Day 6 is when we leave London unfortunately, but nothing planned for today except leaving.

My main concern (other than everything going horribly wrong of course!) is Borough Market - we're all foodies and love food, so we absolutely want to go there for lunch, but I don't know if we'll have enough time between the Charging of the Guard/St James Park to go to Borough Market, and then head back in time for the Westminster Abbey tour? We'd probably take public transport to Borough Market and back, but I still don't know if it'll work, especially if we want to stop to take photos/see the various things? If not, does anyone have any suggestions on how I could make it better? 

Given all that, how's the itinerary looking overall? Is there anything that's maybe a bit too ambitious, or anything that might need changing? Nothing activity wise has been booked yet, so if anyone has any suggestions I'm all ears!

1mhfm68,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mhfm68/how_does_the_nespresso_vertuo_by_breville/,How Does the Nespresso Vertuo by Breville Redefine Coffee Makers?,"Testing out the Nespresso BNV220CRO1BUC1 has been a coffee lover’s dream. As someone who juggles long days and an undying love for good coffee, this machine had me intrigued right off the bat. Its sleek chrome finish not only seamlessly blended into my kitchen decor, but it also managed to give my counter a modern and upscale vibe. The compact dimensions (8"" x 12"" x 12"") meant it didn’t dominate my counter space either—an absolute win for someone living in a modest-sized apartment. While I’m usually skeptical of “do-it-all” gadgets, this particular machine from Breville seemed to prioritize both functionality and style in equal parts.

**Ease of Use and Functionality**  
What stood out to me during the first week of using this espresso maker was how ridiculously easy it is to make coffee. The button interface simplifies everything, eliminating confusion, even for people like my aunt, who barely interacts with technology. The patented Centrifusion technology is a game-changer. It spins the capsules at 7,000 RPM, creating that silky, frothy crema that most coffee enthusiasts crave. Whether I went for a quick espresso shot or poured over ice for a latte, it nailed every recipe effortlessly. Add-ons like automatic shut-off and a 25-second heat-up time? Absolute blessings for impatient caffeine addicts (myself included). 

**Merits**  
- The one-touch brewing works like magic—no fuss or extra steps.  
- Offers versatility with five cup sizes, letting me switch from a tiny espresso to a tall glass of iced coffee.  
- Energy-efficient features such as the automatic shut-off are just the cherry on top.

[Check Nespresso BNV220CRO1BUC1 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b01n6tvx8h/)

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
I found myself coming back to the Vertuo for its impeccable brew quality. Not all coffee machines handle different cup sizes or styles equally well, but this one thrived in all areas. Whether I made a 14oz alto coffee or a 1.35oz shot of espresso, it felt like I just stepped out of a specialty coffee shop. It works exclusively with Vertuo capsules, and while this limits your options compared to machines taking ground coffee or third-party pods, the quality of the brew had me overlooking that little restriction. Plus, scanning the barcode on each capsule to ensure ideal brewing settings? Come on, that’s high-tech wizardry for a coffee machine! 

**Drawbacks**  
- Exclusively compatible with Vertuo pods might lock you into a pricier coffee habit.  
- The used pod container fills up rather quickly.

**Boons for the Modern Coffee Drinker**  
The removable 40oz water tank added another layer of convenience. Refilling wasn’t a hassle, even on my busiest mornings. Plus, the starter pack of Nespresso capsules was a thoughtful touch, letting me sample different flavors without breaking the bank upfront. Friends and coworkers who’ve tried it at my place were equally impressed—especially by how seamlessly it creats iced lattes with nothing but a brew and pour.

**Competing Products**  
Curious about competitors, I compared this machine with Keurig models and the VertuoPlus. While Keurig offers a larger selection of pods (plus compatibility with third-party brands), the Vertuo delivers higher-quality crema, which elevates every cup into a luxurious experience. The VertuoPlus does share many of the same features, but its water tank placement isn’t as flexible for smaller counters. If pod variety and affordability are what you’re after, Keurig might beat this one. However, for brew quality and technology, it’s hard to argue against the Vertuo.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
In terms of cost efficiency, the Vertuo isn’t exactly a budget-friendly find, but it delivers premium features that justify the expense. You’re paying for the patented brewing system, durable quality, and a machine that churns out coffee and espresso just the way you like it every single time. If you’re someone like me, who values reliability, time-saving features, and excellent results, it’s worth every cent.

1mhflu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mhflu7/mark_the_life_of_a_lizard_person/,"Mark, The Life of A Lizard Person","Mark adjusted his face for the hundredth time, trying to mimic the awkward yet confident stride of the humans he'd observed on TouYube. He'd been studying their behavior for weeks, but blending in still felt like a distant dream.

As a member of the lizard people, Mark's mission was to infiltrate human society and gather intel for the impending takeover. But Mark had grown fond of these strange, fleshy creatures. He admired their capacity for kindness, creativity, and resilience.

Mark's daily routine consisted of watching TouYube tutorials on everything from ""How to Make Small Talk"" to ""The Art of Human Gestures."" He practiced smiling in the mirror, trying to capture the essence of human warmth.

One day, while strolling through the park, Mark spotted a group of humans playing frisbee. He watched, mesmerized, as they laughed and high-fived each other. Mark decided to join in, awkwardly tossing the frisbee and attempting to mimic their celebratory gestures.

The humans stared, confused, as Mark's scaly skin and sharp teeth peeked out from beneath his hastily applied human disguise. ""Dude, what's with the... um... costume?"" one of them asked, eyeing Mark's tail.

Mark panicked, realizing he'd forgotten to tuck it away. ""Oh, uh, it's... a... a... cosplay thing!"" he stammered, trying to play it cool.

The humans exchanged skeptical glances, but one of them, a quirky girl with purple hair, approached Mark. ""Hey, I'm Lily. We're having a cosplay party tonight. Want to join us?""

Mark's eyes widened. This could be the perfect opportunity to learn more about humans and maybe even find allies in his quest to defy the lizard people's mission.

As Mark accepted the invitation, he wondered: Could he really pull off being human, or would his true nature be exposed? And what would happen if the lizard people discovered his betrayal?

Mark arrived at the cosplay party, his tail tucked away and his scales carefully concealed beneath a convincing human disguise. Lily greeted him warmly, and they spent the evening mingling with other cosplayers.

As Mark chatted with the humans, he struggled to understand their social cues. He misinterpreted sarcasm for genuine praise and accidentally insulted someone's costume. Despite his efforts, he felt like an outsider trying to crack a secret code.

Lily, however, seemed to take a liking to Mark. She asked him about his favorite fandoms, and Mark, having studied human pop culture, was able to hold a decent conversation. As the night wore on, Mark found himself laughing and joking with Lily, feeling a strange sense of belonging.

But when Lily asked him about his job, Mark panicked. He hadn't prepared for such questions. ""Uh, I'm... a... a freelance... writer?"" he stammered.

Lily's eyes lit up. ""No way! I'm an English major. What kind of writing do you do?""

Mark's mind went blank. He couldn't reveal his true mission or his lizard people's plans. ""Uh, I write... uh... fanfiction?"" he said, hoping it sounded plausible.

To Mark's surprise, Lily's face lit up. ""That's awesome! I've always wanted to write fanfiction. Can I read some of your work?""

Mark's heart sank. He hadn't anticipated this. He quickly fabricated a story about working on a novel, hoping to deflect Lily's interest.

As the night drew to a close, Lily walked Mark home, chatting about everything from books to music. Markfound himself enjoying her company, feeling a connection he couldn't quite explain.

As they said their goodbyes, Lily leaned in and whispered, ""Hey, Mark? You're really interesting. Want to grab coffee sometime?""

One of Mark's three scaly heart skipped a beat. He hadn't expected this level of interest. He hesitated, unsure how to respond.

""Yeah, sure,"" he said finally, trying to sound casual.

Lily smiled and handed him her number. ""Awesome! I'll text you tomorrow.""

Mark watched her walk away, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation. He had no idea how to navigate this newfound connection or what it might mean for his mission.

Over the next few weeks, Mark and Lily's friendship blossomed. They met for coffee, went on walks, and explored the city together. Mark found himself looking forward to their interactions, feeling a sense of joy he couldn't quite explain.

As they spent more time together, Mark began to notice the little things about Lily – the way she laughed, the way her eyes sparkled when she talked about her passions, the way she made him feel like he was home.

Mark couldn't help but feel drawn to Lily. He'd never experienced emotions like this before, and he wasn't sure how to process them. Was this what humans called ""love""?

One day, as they sat in a park watching the sunset, Lily turned to Mark and asked, ""Hey, can I ask you something?""

""Sure,"" Mark replied, his heart racing with anticipation.

""What's your favorite thing about me?"" Lily asked, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.

Mark's mind went blank. He hadn't expected this question. He thought about all the things he loved about Lily – her kindness, her sense of humor, her passion for life – but he struggled to put them into words.

""I... uh... I think it's the way you smile,"" Mark said finally, feeling a little embarrassed.

Lily's face lit up. ""Aww, that's sweet! I love your smile too.""

Mark's heart skipped a beat. He felt a flutter in his chest, and he realized that he might be falling for Lily.

As the days went by, Marl found himself wanting to spend more time with Lily. He began to notice the way she made him feel – like he was worth something, like he belonged.

But Mark knew he couldn't reveal his true nature to Lily. He was trapped in this human disguise, pretending to be someone he wasn't. What would happen if Lily discovered the truth?

Despite his doubts, Mark couldn't help but feel drawn to Lily. He wanted to explore this newfound connection, to see where it might lead.

As they walked hand in hand through the city streets, Marm realized that he might be falling in love with Lily. But what did that mean for his mission, for his loyalty to the lizard people?


Mark's world came crashing down when the leaders of the lizard people confronted him. ""You've been compromised"" one of them hissed. ""Your mission is to gather intel, not to form attachments with humans. Leave the human female alone.""

Mark felt a surge of defiance. ""I won't,"" he said, his voice firm. ""Lily is different. She's kind and smart, and I care about her.""

The leaders' eyes narrowed. ""You named her, ugh!, Disgusting!"", he spat. ""You will leave her alone, or we will take care of her. Do you understand?""

Mark's heart sank. He knew what they meant. He reluctantly agreed, hoping to protect Lily.

The next day, Mark went to Lily's apartment, his heart heavy with foreboding. He took a deep breath and warned her, ""Lily, you need to be careful. There are people who might hurt you. I'm not who you think I am.""

Lily's eyes widened as Mark revealed his true nature. ""I'm a lizard person,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. ""I've been sent to gather intel, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I care about you, Lily.""

Mark suggested they leave together, but Lily was horrified. ""You're a monster,"" she whispered, backing away from him.

Just then, the lizard people burst in, their eyes cold and calculating. ""You have a choice to make,"" one of them said. ""Kill the human female, or we will kill you.""

Mark felt his world crumble. He didn't want to hurt Lily, but he didn't want to die either. With a heavy heart, he made the choice that would haunt him forever.

""Before you begin, show her your true self, let her see the moster that you are"", they sneered. Mark's bones cracked, skin tearing with each fracture of bone. You could see the skin suit tear into nothingness, his once peachy skin becoming a sickly green. His eyes began to glow a blinding yellow, his white teeth shifting and bending, becoming jagged and bloody. Mucus began bleeding through him, what was once blood was now oozing pus.

""Eat her"", they said. Mark whimpered, steam being released from his true form. ""EAT HER!"", they yelled. Mark snarled, ""Why, can't we make this quick. She doesn't deserve pain"". They scoffed at his words, ""She's not one of us. EAT HER!"". Mark began to sob, ""I'm sorry Lily"", he said.

In an instant, Lily was dead. Her body mangled and chewed, she lay there lifeless. Her body contorted like road kill. ""Yes, Yes!. Well done"", they said cheerfully. Mark began to sob, ""I'm sorry Lily, I'm a monster"".They let out a sigh of peace, ""We expect you back in 2 days. Clean this place up, we don't want people to find out about us prematurely"", they said.

As Mark sat in a pool Lily's blood, holding her lifeless body, he realized that he had lost everything. He had lost his chance at love, his chance at redemption, and his chance at a new life.

Mark spent the rest of his days abiding to the rules set for the Lizard people. He did his duty, followed orders, gathered intel, kept his distance when he felt caught out, and stayed indoors at often as possible.
The Lizard people inevitably took over society, and infiltrated the world's government's and powers. Setting in stone their complete world domination. I never heard from Mark again, he died 4 days ago, I found out when visiting his home. I'm one of the last humans left, we keep ourselves hidden, blending in. Mark taught us enough to not raise suspicion, in the end, that lead to his death. ",2,1754319192.0,creepcast,0,0.76,False

It's been my go-to stove for several weeks now, and I can confidently say it delivers on both convenience and performance. As someone who juggles between cooking indoors and outdoors, the sleek portability of this butane cooktop instantly caught my attention. Its lightweight aluminum build makes it remarkably easy to carry around, and the free rigid carrying case is just a cherry on top. It’s as if they knew I’d spill coffee in my backpack and need that extra protection for the stove.

**Ease of Use and Setup**  
The Iwatani 35FW is as close to ""idiot-proof"" as you’re going to get. Operating this portable stove required no technical know-how, which, for someone like me who once burned toast on a panini press, is a blessing. The absence of locking levers means you simply push the fuel can into the magnetic locking system, and voilà – it’s secured. There’s virtually no chance of incorrectly loading the butane canister, and the automatic ignition is smooth as butter.

[Check Iwatani 35FW price on Amazon.](https://triopd.com/p/b00522f2r2/)

**Cooking Performance**  
Let’s talk about those 15,000 BTUs of pure cooking power. For a compact burner, this thing is no slouch. It boils water ridiculously fast, which is a game-changer when trying to whip up a quick ramen bowl before gaming night starts. The advanced heat panel design ensures every drop of butane gets used, leaving behind no wasted fuel. That translates into more bang for your buck – something I genuinely appreciate when using disposable butane canisters.

**Safety Features**  
At first, I was skeptical about using a single-head burner indoors due to the risks of gas. However, the automatic safety shut-off mechanism quickly put my mind at ease. If the pressure inside the fuel canister rises to unsafe levels, the gas flow is cut, and the flame is extinguished. This feature alone makes it a trustworthy option for both seasoned cooks and those new to portable stoves.

**Adaptability in Various Conditions**  
Cooking outside was always a hit-or-miss with gusts of wind playing havoc on open flames. Thankfully, the built-in double windbreaker on this unit ensures the flame burns steadily, regardless of breezes or pesky air conditioning. My windy picnic at the park turned into a pleasant experience as I managed to prepare hot soups for the family without any frustrating interruptions.

**Strengths**  
- Ultra-portable and lightweight; easy to carry with the included sturdy case.  
- Excellent heat output with no wasted fuel.  
- Built-in windbreaker for outdoor reliability.  
- Impressive safety features like automatic shut-off.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Aluminum build can feel less premium compared to stainless steel alternatives.  
- Single burner limits versatility in cooking multiple dishes simultaneously.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this model to others like the Coleman Portable Butane Stove and the Chef Master 90019, I noted some stark differences. While both competitors also offer solid performance with decent safety features, they fall short in efficiency. The Iwatani cooktop’s magnetic locking system and heat panel are unmatched, leaving no leftover butane in the canister. Coleman does, however, boast a slightly heavier-duty build, which I imagine would hold up better over many camping trips. When it comes to sleek, ergonomic designs, though, Iwatani pulls ahead.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Looking at the price-to-quality ratio, this is where the Iwatani 35FW really hits the mark. Yes, it leans toward the premium side of portable burners, but that’s justified by its durability, efficiency, and reliable safety features. It's one of those purchases you make knowing it’s going to pay dividends for years in terms of ease, fuel savings, and reduced stress about safety quizzes mid-barbeque.

Mythology might be the ancient cheat code you didn’t know you needed 🏺⚡,"When life gets messy—bad day at work, relationship drama, existential crisis at 3 a.m.—I’ve started asking myself: “How would a Greek hero handle this?”

(…and no, the answer is not “fight a minotaur.”)

Here’s the thing: mythology isn’t just old-timey fantasy with gods throwing lightning bolts. It’s basically the OG self-help section—full of characters who screw up, rise up, and learn stuff the hard way. Which… sounds like every one of us, right?

Some of my favorite “myth hacks” for daily life:

💬 Own your mess like a leader.
Zeus might be questionable at… many things… but other myths show leaders who make hard choices and stand by them. At work or in life, lead with fairness, not ego.

⚔️ Strategize, don’t spiral.
Odysseus didn’t just swim harder, he thought smarter. When you’re stuck, take a breath and plot your next move.

🔥 Don’t let your emotions burn down the village.
Plenty of myths show people losing everything over jealousy or rage. Sometimes the win is walking away.

💖 Stop chasing other people’s idea of worth.
Aphrodite may be the goddess of beauty, but even she had to deal with insecurity. Your value isn’t up for debate—it’s yours to own.

🌿 Accept what you can’t control.
Even heroes have to bow to fate sometimes. Save your energy for what you can change.

Why this works:
Myths sneak life lessons into stories so vivid, you actually remember them. They’re proof that humans have been struggling with the same junk—love, ambition, anger, fear—for thousands of years… and surviving it.

I noticed I was clenching and grinding, especially at night, so I got a mouthguard. It helped reduce the tension in my jaw and even fixed some TMJ issues I had developed—my jaw used to pop and wouldn't open straight, but that’s improved.

At a recent dental checkup, my dentist pointed out that my enamel is cracked in some areas, and I have gum recession on a few teeth. Some spots are a bit sensitive, and I can see that near the gum line, the teeth look noticeably thinner.

I really want to preserve my teeth as long as possible and avoid bigger problems down the line. I’m looking for two things:

1. Tips for preventing further damage


2. What kind of dental/health issues I should expect if this gets worse



For prevention, here’s what I’m currently doing:

Cut back on soda and acidic drinks (still drink occasionally, using a straw or rinsing with water after)

One coffee per day max and in the morning. 

Using fluoride toothpaste (I leave it in my mouth for about 5 minutes before rinsing—should I even rinse?)

Working on reducing stress to help with grinding

I forgot to order before my existing bags ran out and found myself staring wistfully at my new B&W Wilton Benitez Thermal Shock Caturra and Sagastume Gesha with roast dates of just a few days ago. I wasn't about to go coffee-less for the next couple weeks of rest time so I decided to browse the local grocery store coffee selection for the first time ever. 

On the bottom shelf was a very small collection of some more ""premium-looking"" options, price tags nearing $20. A good sign, I thought. Nope. Pre-ground, dark roast, no dates except the expiration, house blend. I squatted in the aisle indecisively comparing beans for 10 minutes before settling on a $9 bag of nondescript Intelligentsia whole beans as that was the only name I'd heard of and tried before. 

I opened it up right as I got home and saw that the beans themselves looked pretty decent. Roughly medium roast, no shiny charcoal exterior like I expected. The beans themselves had fairly low quality control as there were random broken chunks everywhere but I wasn't too worried. At this point I was fairly optimistic to challenge myself to get a good cup and started with a very standard V60 recipe: 1:16 ratio, 95°C, 4 clicks on ZP6, 4:6 method. The cup came out awfully bitter and had a flavor profile I could only describe as ""overwhelming"".

Back to the drawing board, maybe I need way less extraction to get some decent flavors out. This time I switched up almost everything: Kalita Wave, 1:17 ratio, 90°C, 5 clicks on ZP6, 2-pour method. The cup came out marginally less bitter and the flavor slightly improved from overwhelming to just ""nausea-inducing"". After this I played around a few more times with recipe and ratio tweaks and got similar results each time with not a single cup that was remotely enjoyable. 

Is there anything I can do to redeem this poor bag of beans or was this a valuable lesson in the importance of the coffee itself? (and also proper planning for order and rest times)",0,1754318653.0,pourover,20,0.5,False

I'm looking for unique activities to build my bond with Jesus. I work with multiple deities in my craft and the oldest deity relationship I have is with Loki.

Outside of ""official"" things like spell work and tarot readings, I like to light a candle to invite Loki to the space and then spend time with him by creating Spotify playlists together, or playing a game where I roll a dice so he can decide what dialogue choices the character makes! Sometimes I will also make my coffee with cinnamon in it for him.

I am looking for this kind of vibe but with Jesus, and I'm struggling to find ideas and resources. Everyone simply suggests prayer, church, etc, and I already do all of those things. I am looking for something that is a more casual religious activity, but something I can still devote to him and use to deepen our bond.

So far I have decided I'm going to learn how to knit blankets (and then donate them to homeless organisation). While I do this, I will invite Jesus to my space and spend time with him, like I would with Loki! 😄

Outside of that though, I don't have any ideas!

# Best 1 Gram filter Bag 2025: Top Picks & Reviews

The 1-gram filter bag is a critical component for various industries and applications, especially within sectors like herbal processing, tea brewing, and precise material separation. These bags, designed to hold one gram of material, are essential for ensuring accurate dosage, containment, and clean filtration. Their importance stems from their ability to streamline processes, reduce waste, and maintain product quality across diverse uses.In 2025, the market for 1-gram filter bags is anticipated to be competitive, with numerous options catering to different needs and budgets. Therefore, selecting the right filter bag requires careful consideration of factors such as material quality, pore size, tensile strength, and heat resistance. Choosing the optimal bag ensures performance, durability, and safety.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and effectiveness of a 1-gram filter bag depend heavily on it's features. here are the critical aspects to consider when evaluating the best options for 2025:

**Material Composition:**

The material used in constructing a 1-gram filter bag is paramount. Common materials include nylon, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and food-grade paper. High-quality nylon offers excellent tensile strength and chemical resistance,making it suitable for demanding applications. PET provides good heat resistance and is frequently enough preferred for situations involving higher temperatures. Food-grade paper, typically used for tea and herbal infusions, ensures safe consumption and does not impart unwanted flavors. Manufacturers often specify the grade of the material to indicate its purity and safety for specific uses.

**Pore Size and Filtration Efficiency:**

Pore size determines the level of filtration achieved by the bag. Measured in microns, the pore size indicates the diameter of the particles that can pass through the filter. For applications requiring precise separation,a smaller pore size (e.g., 20-50 microns) is essential to prevent fine particles from escaping. Conversely, a larger pore size might be suitable for applications where a faster flow rate is desired, albeit with slightly lower filtration efficiency. The consistency and uniformity of pore size across the entire bag are also crucial for maintaining consistent filtration performance batch after batch.

**Tensile Strength and Durability:**

The tensile strength of a filter bag dictates its ability to withstand mechanical stress without tearing or rupturing.This is particularly significant in automated filling and sealing processes, or when handling abrasive materials. Bags made from high-quality materials like reinforced nylon typically exhibit superior tensile strength. Manufacturers often specify the tensile strength in pounds per square inch (PSI), providing a quantitative measure of the bag's durability. Factors such as seam construction also contribute to the overall strength and longevity of the filter bag.

**Heat Resistance and chemical Compatibility:**

Depending on the intended application, heat resistance and chemical compatibility are critical considerations. Filter bags used in brewing applications must withstand high temperatures without degradation. Bags made from PET or high-temperature nylon are preferred for these scenarios.In chemical processing, the bag material must be inert to the substances being filtered to prevent contamination or degradation of the bag itself. Manufacturers provide chemical compatibility charts,outlining the bag's resistance to various chemicals and solvents.

**Sealing Method and Integrity:**

The sealing method employed in constructing the filter bag significantly impacts its overall integrity and leak-proof performance. Common sealing methods include heat sealing, ultrasonic welding, and mechanical crimping. heat sealing creates a strong, airtight seal by fusing the material together. Ultrasonic welding offers similar advantages while minimizing heat exposure, which can be crucial for temperature-sensitive materials. Mechanical crimping is often used for paper filter bags and provides a secure, albeit less airtight, closure. The integrity of the seal must be consistent across all bags to prevent leakage or contamination.

**Bag Dimensions and fill Volume:**

Even though the bags are designed for 1 gram, slight variations in dimensions can affect ease of use and suitability for specific equipment. Manufacturers typically specify the dimensions in millimeters or inches. Uniformity in bag dimensions is crucial for automated filling and sealing processes to ensure consistent fill weights and prevent jams or malfunctions. While designed for 1 gram, slight overfilling maybe required (e.g., 1.1 grams) depending on material density; this needs to be considered when choosing the appropriate bag size.

## Core Benefits

The effective use of 1-gram filter bags provides numerous advantages across different applications. Here are some key benefits:

**Precise Dosage Control:** By design, 1-gram filter bags ensure accurate and consistent dosage measurement. This is particularly crucial in industries such as herbal medicine and specialized tea blends, where precise ingredient ratios are vital for efficacy and quality control. Utilizing these bags eliminates the variability associated with manual measurement, ensuring that each serving or application delivers the intended amount of active ingredient.

**Enhanced Product Purity:** Filter bags prevent the unwanted dispersion of materials, maintaining product purity. This ensures that only the desired constituents are extracted or processed. This is particularly important in applications involving fine powders or particulate matter, where preventing contamination is essential. These bags capture impurities, resulting in a cleaner and more refined final product.

**Streamlined Workflow and Reduced Waste:** These bags simplify the workflow by pre-portioning materials and reducing the need for manual handling. This streamlines processes and reduces the likelihood of spillage or overdosing. This reduces waste and minimizes cross-contamination, contributing to a more efficient and environmentally amiable operation.

**Improved User Convenience:** For end-users, 1-gram filter bags offer unparalleled convenience. They eliminate the guesswork involved in measuring out small quantities, making them ideal for applications such as brewing individual cups of tea or preparing single-dose herbal remedies. Further, the sealed nature of these bags enhances portability and prevents material degradation from exposure to air or moisture; extending product shelf life.

**Consistent Extraction and Infusion:** Using the bags facilitates optimal extraction and consistent infusion of materials.This is especially pertinent in tea and coffee brewing, where the quality of the brew depends significantly on even distribution and efficient contact with the water. 1-gram filter bags consistently result in a smoother brew with optimized flavor.

## FAQs Section

**Are these 1-gram filter bags food-grade and safe for tea or herbal infusions?**
Yes, many 1-gram filter bags are manufactured using food-grade materials such as food-grade paper or nylon, suitable for tea and herbal infusions.It’s really critically important to check the product descriptions before purchasing to ensure proper use, and safety for intended purposes. Always look for certifications from organizations like the FDA or EU Food Safety Authority, when available.

**What is the best way to seal these filter bags after filling?**
The best sealing method relies on the type of material the bag contains and its design. Heat-sealable bags can be sealed effectively using a heat sealer device following the manufacturer’s instructions. For food-grade paper bags, mechanical crimping tools offer a secure seal. Ensure that the sealing is airtight and free from tears to prevent leakage of materials.**Can these filter bags be used for both hot and cold applications?**
It depends on the material composition and the manufacturer’s specifications. Some materials, like PET or high-temperature nylon, are designed to withstand high temperatures, making them suitable for hot applications. Others, such as food-grade paper, might not be as resistant to heat and are better suited for cold or lukewarm applications. Carefully reviewing the product details is critical before use.

**What pore size should I choose for my application?**
Pore size selection depends on the filtration precision that a specific application requires. Smaller pore sizes (e.g., 20-50 microns) are suitable for filtering out fine particles, while larger pore sizes allow for faster liquid flow while filtering less precisely.Herbal infusions with coarse particulates might benefit from larger-pore bags, while pharmaceuticals or other materials that require precision necessitate smaller-pore options.

[**Original**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/93ic2i/i_42m_think_wife_40f_might_be_cheating/)

I have recently been starting to wonder if my wife might be cheating but am not sure what to do from here. I have no smoking gun for evidence so I don't want to confront her or bring it up in case nothing is happening, or to have her cover things up.

It has just been small things and a spidey sense. About 4 months ago she started working out a lot more and became much more interested in how she looks. She is very attractive but never really wore much makeup or did much with her hair. She has also started being protective with her phone, which I know is a bad sign. It is normal for us to go into each other's phone but know it never leaves her side and if I ask for it to take a picture or something, she will tell me to use mine. 

She has also been staying late at work more often and has been taking a few more out of town trips for work. In this last 4 months she hasn't initiated any kind of intimacy and only gives me pecking type of kisses. I tried to initiate with her a hand full of times and she rejected me a few times and a few times she let me go through with it but wasn't engaged and just laid there. It made me feel really bad, worse than getting rejected outright. I brought up the lack of intimacy a while back and she said that she was exhausted all the time from being a mom, work, and lifting weights. She said that she would try to do a better job and kissed me later that night but nothing has changed.

I have wondered if it might be some kind of midlife crisis kind of thing. There is a guy at her work that I am thinking could be trouble. My wife used to talk about him a lot but a few months ago she quite mentioning him. But I know they still work closely together. From what I can gather, he is married with kids and told my wife that he is having marital issues. I met him briefly a few times and he basically ignored me (we were around a lot of other people). He isn't nearly as attractive as me and definitely not in great shape like me (not to brag but it's true). I am big and strong and he is kind of average and a little over weight. But he dresses flashy and is outgoing and likes to drink (I don't really like drinking and my wife has mentioned a few times that she wished I would go out drinking every now and then). 

I graduated high school and he has a master's degree. He also makes a lot more money than I do. I train fighters and love what I do, but make a very modest living. This guy probably makes 6x what I do and flaunts what he has. I just bring up all that as my assessment of how we differ. The biggest thing that I have been wondering about is that this last trip for work was at a tropical resort-type of place and my understanding at the time was that there were a big group of them going. It turns out that it was just my wife, the flashy guy, and the CEO. The CEO is very old and doesn't really interact socially, he is just all business. In my imagination, my wife and this other guy spent a lot of time together over that week doing who knows what.

My dilemma is that I want to see if my gut feeling is right, but don't want to cause a bigger issue by accusing her are asking. We have had a few ups and downs over the years but have had a pretty good overall marriage from my side. No major issues or anything. I am not the most outgoing guy and I don't make much money, which has been a small issue for my wife. She says I am not living up to my potential and I could make a lot more money doing something else. I don't want to make it sound like she is obsessed with money in any way, but I know women are more comfortable with a bigger nest egg. She thinks I can do other things but I am not really qualified for anything other than fighting or training fighters. That's basically been my entire life. Or, possibly being a personal trainer. None of those things are big money makers. But other than those things, she seems pretty happy.

A friend of mine said I should keep my suspicions to myself and start doing things to spy and collect evidence, if it's there. But I feel weird about violating her privacy. If she is cheating I can't imagine I would ever stay with her. I hope I am wrong about all of this. But thoughts of her cheating are starting to flood my mind and I feel like I need to find out either way. We have two kids and that is the part that scares me. I am involved in every part of my kid's lives and my heart would be broken to only see them half the time. Sorry for the long post. I would love to hear some ideas on how to deal with this.

**UPDATE:** *Within the post*

So here is the newest information. I was able to get the login information for our cell phone account. She uses here phone a lot for work and nothing looked weird until I started sorting the numbers and times. There were a ton of texts to one specific number at times very late at night (a few hours after we go to bed). I am going to see whose number that belongs to and find a way to get into her phone and see what name it is saved under. After I saw this I started to get emotional and angry. I tried to tell myself it could be a mistake or some girlfriend of hers. 

Last night I tried to initiate, expecting to be rejected. And rejected I was. She said she was sorry but was too tired and had a headache. I told her that I was feeling like we weren't connecting very well. She said she is sorry and will try to be better. She said that last time. I didn't push the issue or anything, just told her goodnight and went to bed. This morning she told me she was thinking about taking a girls trip to Vegas (she doesn't gamble). I asked who she would go with and it was a few girls I never met. Apparently friends from college. Maybe all this is a coincidence but a lot of stuff is looking weird.

[**Update 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9445yv/update_i_42m_think_wife_40f_might_be_cheating/)- *2 days later*

You can read the original post for background. Basically, I have been suspecting my wife might be cheated for a while. I finally did some snooping and looked at the detailed cell phone records online. I noticed that there were texts to one number that were made in the middle of the night. They were in the hundreds. 

I called the number from a pay phone and it went to one of her coworkers (the one I thought could be trouble). I was able to get her phone while she was in the shower and the text conversation was the one thing deleted. Also, that guys number was saved in her phone and a female's name. I am now very worried about the out of town trips that she was on where this guy was with her. 

I had to leave the house and cool off. I was able to get it together enough to come home but don't know what to do from here. If I confront her with what I have, she will probably explain it away. I don't know if I should try to keep it quiet and get more evidence or if I should come out with it sooner. I am really really angry. I am furious at her but also wanting to go after the guy. It will take everything I have to not do that. I am worried that she will admit to inappropriate flirting and I won't have enough evidence to get her to admit it all. Any advice on when to confront her?

I am going to stay awake during the time she texts him and then interrupt her and ask her who she is texting. See if she lies to me.

[**Update 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/94amg8/update_2_i_42m_think_wife_40f_might_be_cheating/) - *3 days later*

I laid in wait last night after everybody went to bed. I pretended to be asleep and waited to see if she got out of bed to get on her phone. Sure enough, she gets up a little after midnight and goes into another room and closes the door. I wait a few minutes and I got up and quickly opened the door and walked up to her and said I couldn't sleep and asked what she was doing. I caught her mid-text and was standing over her too fast for her to delete anything. I watched her hand as she slowly tried to tuck the phone away. She said she couldn't sleep either and was texting a girlfriend. I had a plan and went into it.

I got on top of her and started kissing her and asked if she wanted to fool around. As I expected she said she couldn't. So I started laughing and tickling her and made a comment that she must be more into the girlfriend that she was texting than me. Then I started to playfully wrestle with her and got the phone. I could see the panic in her eyes.

She tried to get it back from me but I turned away and held it in the air, like I was playing keep away. I was laughing and acting like I was having fun the entire time. I told her that I was going to call this girlfriend and ask if she was into my wife. My wife yelled out, ""please don't call her"". I started walking away and pulled up the text messages and I saw one that said ""Can't wait to see you tomorrow"". 

I pressed the call feature and it seemed like it took forever, but sure enough the guy answered. I hadn't planned out what to say so I just hung up. Then I started reading through the texts in front of my wife, I asked her if she though her girlfriend answered, or a guy. She didn't say anything. Then I started reading off the texts out loud and asked her why she was sending this to a guy at night. She said she didn't know. I asked her if she needed to tell me anything. She was quiet. Then I told her that I had looked at the cell phone records and knew everything. I knew when she would wake up to text this guy and that I knew who the guy was. She started crying and saying she was sorry. I kept my cool.

I explained that the next few minutes were very important and if she didn't tell me the complete truth that there would be severe consequences. She said she started flirting with her coworker and that he was having marital issues and it turned into flirting. She said she never did anything with this guy. My fear was she would only admit to what I already knew. I told her that if she can't give me the entire truth that she needed to pack a bag and leave. 

She agreed to do that, as she cried and said she was sorry. Before she left the house she asked if I was going to leave her. I told her that it was late and we would discuss that later. She left for her mom's house and I haven't seen her since. But she was blowing up my phone so I turned it off. My plan is to try to find a marriage counselor and make an appointment. I want my wife to think I want to work things out for a while until then, when I will explain that I am at counseling to get walked through the process of splitting up.

This entire incident last night was something I had planned out in my head. Since I was pretending to wrestle with her and tickling her I wanted to cover myself. So I recorded everything with my phone, just in case she tried to accuse me of something. I asked my friend if me recording in our state was legal and he said it was. I don't think she would ever falsely accuse me of anything but if I am leaving her, she might get desperate. I am 6'4"" and an athletic 240 lbs. I am also an ex-fighter and now train fighters. So if there is any accusation of abuse I will not be believed and will get arrested and lose my kids. So my plan is to record everything from here on out just as an insurance policy.

I am completely heartbroken right now. My entire family has been blown up. I will miss 50% of my kid's lives growing up and feel destroyed. I had suspected something but am still in shock. The worst part is that this is all just beginning. I want to confront the other guy but will need to restrain myself. I was told that he said I looked terrifying when he first saw me, so I would like to scare him. I also saw that he referred to me as ""the animal"" in one of the texts, after she made a comment about me not being too bright. I don't make much money or have a college degree but I am an intellectually curious person and read lots of books about all sorts of topics. I am not the smartest guy but I feel like I am not stupid. I will try to update as things go on. Not sure what advice I can get at this point. I am just devastated.

[**Update 3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/95ywup/update_3_i_42m_think_wife_40f_might_be_cheating/) - *8 days later*

I appreciate all the support I have received through this ordeal. I am going through a lot right now and wish I have had the time to respond to the advice and words of encouragement passed my way.

To update, my attorney friend was able to recommend a lawyer that specializes in family law. Not only that, but supposedly this guy was also cheated on and these cases allow him to exact revenge (this is what my friend said when he recommended this lawyer). He is going to be very flexible on his fees and genuinely wants to help. Maybe this is on the positive side of the ledger.

Now onto the other side, my wife admitted to the affair. She told me that it started as flirting, then turned into an emotional affair, but never turned physical. I saw right through that and then she finally admitted that it turned physical, which coincided with the point in time when she shut down intimacy with me. I got a lot more details than I thought I could take. It was a very hot and steamy affair. 

To say this has really messed me up would be an understatement to the highest degree. I am wrestling with my emotions and can't keep a thought in my head. I told my wife it would be best for her to stay with her mom for the time being and that I will take care of the kids, so they can be at home and have some stability. My attorney is working his magic in the meantime. I am in the house and this is a big advantage, according to him. I have also not told her that our marriage is over. She will find that out when she is served the papers, which will be coming soon.

I can't keep the intrusive images of my wife and this guy out of my head. I coach Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for professional and semi-professional fighters, and am trying to give them as much attention as I can. The physicality of my job seems to have been helpful. Obviously I am also putting everything into my kids. Outside of BJJ, my passion is learning about new topics. I normally read for a few hours a night to unwind. But I haven't even been able to get through a paragraph without losing focus. After seeing that they were referring to me as a stupid animal, I imagine all the other things they may have said. The whole thing has really got to me. I have always been a happy person but the joy is just gone.

On another note, the word has got out on what has happened and there have been a lot of people offering to assist in any way they can. It definitely helps to feel like I have support. A number of my friend's wives have sprung into action and said they know beautiful women that they want to hook me up with. Including a few that know me and are very interested in my upcoming single status. I won't be dating until this is all over with, and probably not for a while after that. But knowing that there are a lot of options is a nice feeling. I think I will be okay. Right now, it's just all about the kids.

I will try to update at some point soon. My wife is hysterical and is pushing to stay married. I know I can't get over what she did so staying together would be delaying the inevitable.

[**Update 4**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b6bbye/update_4_i_42m_think_wife_40f_might_be_cheating/) - *7 months later (from OG Post)*

Life has been chaotic but I wanted to log back into this throwaway account and give an update on my situation. I had discovered my wife having an affair and also found out that she thought I was stupid, and a loser for not earning a high salary. I filed for divorce and it should be wrapped up next month. We will have 50/50 custody and she will be paying spousal support, since she out-earns me by a large margin. That is the current legal situation. Now on to the other fallout.

I am heartbroken, as are my kids. I never thought I would be a single dad but here I am. My wife seems to be falling into some kind of depression. The guy she cheated with decided that she wasn't worth the trouble. From what I am told, she has started drinking and going out with a lot of random guys that she meets online. There have been more than a handful of times where she called me and begged me to take her back, so she can have her old life back. Part of me wanted that but I have held strong. After she found out how much money she will have to pay me every month, that seems to have made her angry towards me. So I don't have to worry about her calling.

My kids don't understand. Every second they aren't with me, I feel miserable. I am also lonely all the time. I haven't spent much time with friends and mostly just stay home. The girl that works at a coffee shop I frequent even asked me if everything was okay, because I looked sad. I guess am not hiding it as well as I think. There are people I know that want to set me up with women they know but I don't want to do it because I feel like I am branded as the guy whose wife cheated on him. It has been so long, I have no idea how to date. I had a few fighters do really well on a pretty public stage and that has been the only spark I have felt in a long time. I really don't know what I will do next. At some point, I need to snap out of it and move on. I just haven't reached that level of motivation though.

I did have somebody I know get into contact with the other guy's wife, and show her the proof I had. I just couldn't live with nothing happening to him. I am not allowed to go after him, so this was the next best thing. She didn't believe it at first, but then I heard about there being major marriage issues for them. As far as I know, they are together but on the rocks. I have a lot of anger over everything. It is crazy to think how life can be fine one minute, then completely upside down the next.

One positive that has happened is that I did meet a girl through some friends that I am interested in. I haven't asked her out or anything though. She is stunningly beautiful but is about 14 years my junior. I don't know that's a major issue but that is a pretty big age gap. Given what I have been though, I think my confidence has really been dinged. I feel like she is too attractive for me. She might actually be, I suppose. But I have been thinking about her a lot.

So that's been the last half-year of my life. I have to say it has been the worst I have ever felt. I have always been a very happy person but just feel dark and gloomy now.

[**Final Update**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rayray0099/comments/ik1gl8/update_5_i_42m_think_wife_40f_might_be_cheating/) - *2 years later (from OG Post)*

I haven't been on Reddit in a very long time. I logged in and saw that there were some people asking for updates to my situation, so I thought I would let everybody know that I am doing well.

Long story short - I found out my wife was cheating on me with a coworker. Then I divorced her. I was with her for about 15 years in total so to say my new life has been an adjustment would be an understatement. I do have moments where I feel a sense of sadness or loss, but those are fleeting. For the most part, I feel great. My kids are doing well and they are with me a lot. 

One of the things that happened after the divorce was my wife had to take in more accounts at work to pay for her new single living situation, as well as spousal support to me (she earned a lot more than me). When the pandemic hit, I had a very flexible schedule so I was able to keep the kids with me and do home schooling. Since my job involved physical contact with other people, the pandemic has slowed that down (not a lot of opportunities for my guys right now). So in a way, it has been like I am a stay-at-home dad.

I took some time to myself after the whole ordeal. The younger girl I was interested in took a long assignment with her company in Europe. We stayed in touch through technology. After her assignment ended, she came back and we have been together ever since. She loves me and my kids. She is an extremely compassionate and considerate person. Before we were introduced, I was told that there was an amazing woman that resembled Wonder Woman and was the nicest person you could ever meet. I thought it was too good to be true, but she is absolutely the real deal. I think there will probably be some next steps in our relationship coming soon.

Things for my ex have not really worked out. She started drinking and hooking up with random guys she met online. Having to take more accounts has also taken a toll on her. Just in the last few years, she looks like she has aged 15 years. She was always pretty but the last time I saw her she looked ragged. Like her life force was depleted. A weird thing to say, but that's what it looked like. Her best friend told me that she is miserable and hard to be around. 

I don't think I will ever understand how a person that is seemingly happy and in control of their life can spiral into such a dark place. My ex's friend did also tell me that she never thought I would leave her after the affair. I think she felt a sense of control over me because of her high income. So the affair had consequences that she didn't anticipate. I do hope she finds peace, for my kid's sake.

Other than some challenges due to the pandemic, things are great. I am so glad I immediately ended my first marriage, rather than dragging it out. I knew I was making the difficult decision, but that it was the right thing to do. Then I just grinded along. I have no problem inching a little forward every day, knowing eventually I will get through. If you are in this situation, you need to thing about things in the long term. You might feel devastated at first. 

Then sad. Then depressed. Then hopeless. But no matter what you push ahead (workout hard every day too). The key is to try to do one thing every day that improves you or ads to your skillset (not self-help stuff, but real skills). I got into making short films of the guys I train and learned about videography and editing, which has been a fun hobby. I read more books to learn about all sorts of things. I just tried to do something every day. Small things add up over time. You just need to make sure you are putting in the work and let yourself be patient.

I waited a couple of weeks, but there was no invitation, so I texted him. He responded instantly. We had our first coffee, and he offered to pay. The meeting went really well. We had something interesting in common. He said we should meet again, but he didn’t follow up, and it’s been a few weeks now.

During our first meeting, I didn’t give any hints of being sexual because I was only interested in being friends. But now things have changed - I’m too horny. At least I know a bit about him: where he works, his family history. He seems like a nice guy.

Whether it’s my morning tea ritual or a quick cup of hot water for instant soup during lunch breaks, this appliance has certainly revolutionized how I view boiling water. I'll dive deeply into all its features, quirks, and performance to help give you the most accurate take.

**Design and Build Quality**

On unboxing the Chefman RJ11-18-PL, I was immediately drawn to its sleek design. The borosilicate glass body coupled with stainless steel accents gives it a stylish and modern look. Toss in those blue LED lights that illuminate while heating, and suddenly, you’ve got a centerpiece for your countertop. It’s aesthetic without being ostentatious, fitting well into a minimalist or contemporary kitchen vibe. The heat-resistant handle ensures a cool and comfortable grip, and the removable lid simplifies cleaning—a feature I genuinely appreciated after the first couple of uses.

**Performance You Can’t Ignore**

The 1500W fast-boiling mechanism is no joke. We’re talking a full 1.8 liters of water boiled in under three minutes. That’s faster than the time it takes me to decide which tea flavor I’m in the mood for. It made preparing oatmeal for my kids in the mornings effortless while simultaneously cutting down my breakfast prep time. And the automatic shut-off paired with boil-dry protection not only makes it safer but offers peace of mind—for those forgetful moments, you know?

[Find the best price for Chefman RJ11-18-PL on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0c5z8vchx/)

**Ease of Use**

A standout aspect for me was the cordless convenience. Sure, the base remains plugged in, but the freedom to lift the kettle and pour without a dangling cord adds so much flexibility. Plus, the 360-degree swivel base makes it friendly for left- or right-handed users, so no worries if you’re ambidextrous or sharing the kettle with someone who is. The stainless-steel filter effectively traps any scale or impurities, ensuring cleaner water every time.

**Advantages**

- Rapid boiling in under 3 minutes for maximum efficiency.  
- Blue LED indicators add a modern, functional flair.  
- Safety features ensure automatic shut-off and prevent overheating.  
- Cordless serving convenience with a 360-degree swivel base.  

**Disadvantages**

- Exterior can smudge easily due to the glass finish.  
- No control settings for temperature adjustments, which coffee enthusiasts might miss.  

**How It Stacks up to Competitors**

Having sampled other electric kettles like the Hamilton Beach and Cosori models, the Chefman feels like the right midpoint for those who value aesthetics, safety, and performance. While some competitors offer variable temperature settings—a feature aimed at coffee enthusiasts—the Chefman focuses on fast boiling and safety features. The build quality outdoes budget kettles, but if you nitpick, the lack of temperature control might make you lean toward higher-end options like Breville.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

Given its durable materials, sleek design, and safety-first approach, the Chefman’s price feels justified. In comparison to both entry-level and high-end models, it provides value without going overboard. For casual users like myself, or even families, it checks the right boxes without feeling like you’re splurging.

If your mom’s the sentimental type. Preload it with old family photos, little videos or a couple of notes. She wont even have to set it up, just plug it in and it starts playing.

* Touchscreen, rotates automatically, and you can upload pics via app/email
* You can keep adding stuff remotely, which is a low effort way to keep the gift alive throughout the year
* She'll like it enough to just casually ask “have you sent anything new?”, trust me
* Tip: take just candids and upload, moms love that

**2.** [**Foot Massager(bob and brads good)**  ](http://blu-exc.github.io/redirector/?to=massager)**8.5/10**

For moms who work a lot or have got orthopedic issues. No mom is gonna ask for this directly but will love it if gifted. Also lowkey everyone in the family gets to use it then, good investment imo. 

* feels like a real massage, not the buzz-y kind
* Comes with heat and a remote
* Not that expensive compared to others with similar specs

**3.** [**Personalized bamboo tea box**  ](http://blu-exc.github.io/redirector/?to=bamboo) **7.5/10**

If you've got an almond mom lol or if she's just green tea obsessed. Honestly you could replace this with whatever she likes in specific(coffee etc), this one just looked cute to me.

* You can customize the front with her name or a little message
* Looks super cute on the kitchen counter
* It’s out of stock sometimes, but worth checking around mother’s day or holidays",1,1754317825.0,u_lampasul,0,1.0,False
1mhf0nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTicker/comments/1mhf0nk/swiss_are_ready_to_make_more_attractive_trade/,Swiss Are Ready to Make More Attractive Trade Offer to US,"Bloomberg) -- The Swiss government said it is determined to win over the US on trade after last week’s shock announcement of 39% tariffs on exports to America.

“Switzerland enters this new phase ready to present a more attractive offer, taking US concerns into account and seeking to ease the current tariff situation,” it said in a statement on Monday, highlighting its foreign direct investments and research and development push in the US. It also excluded countermeasures for the time being. 

With the new levies — the highest among industrial nations — scheduled to go into effect on Thursday, President and Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter convened an emergency meeting of the governing Federal Council to discuss how to proceed. 

Negotiators with the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs have already reached out to their US counterparts to try and find a way forward. Bern is focusing on getting at least a longer timeline than Thursday, according to an official close to the talks, adding that anything improving the current situation would be a win.

 
 
Washington’s move came as a surprise as talks ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline had looked promising. A Thursday night call instead focused on Switzerland’s trade surplus in goods with the US.

The Swiss government stressed on Monday that the overhang “is not the result of any ‘unfair trade practices’.” 

Switzerland’s outsized gold exports are partly to blame for the distorted trade balance. The country is the world’s biggest refining hub for the precious metal, with billions of dollars worth of gold constantly flowing into and out of the nation. 

Pharmaceuticals, coffee and watches are the other main drivers. 

Keller-Sutter, who was criticized in the Swiss press over the weekend for allowing Trump to blindside her without a backup plan, said she would be willing to make a last-minute trip to Washington if she thought there was a chance a deal could be made.

“I don’t rule out such a visit, but first, the two sides should come closer together in their positions,” she told the newspaper Schweiz am Wochenende. It’s not clear what, if any, response there has been from the US government.

Despite the backlash, the Swiss president doesn’t face any immediate danger of losing her job. The system is designed for continuity, and the presidency rotates on an annual basis, meaning her term running the country will come to a close at the end of the year.

Switzerland ran a $38 billion bilateral trade surplus with the US last year, according to US Census data, which was the 13th biggest for the world’s largest economy. While Swiss exports to the US collapsed after the introduction of tariffs in April, they rebounded in June, suggesting that trade between the two countries remained robust.

There aren’t many routes available to Switzerland, but one is to offer to buy liquefied natural gas from the US. While the landlocked country is focused on hydroelectric and nuclear power, it does use a small amount of gas, primarily in the winter to cushion swings in its energy supply. Should Switzerland choose to import more gas, it would have to travel through neighboring countries, which could potentially increase transit costs.

So far, the expectation appears to be that Keller-Sutter and the government will secure a better deal. The Swiss market benchmark SMI was down just 0.5% as of 3:15 p.m. on Monday.

“We expect negotiations to bring the 39% Swiss tariff rate closer to the 15% agreed with the EU,” Lombard Odier investment strategists said in a research note. “In the unlikely event that this trade dispute is not resolved,” they added, they will revise their forecast for gross domestic product.

Given the “volatility of decisions we’ve seen from the US,” there’s hope that a solution may be found, Franziska Ryser, a lawmaker of the Green party, told Bloomberg.

“On the other hand, we must draw political conclusions from the situation and acknowledge that — at least under the Trump administration — America is no longer a reliable partner,” she said. “This means that we should strengthen cooperation with the EU and coordinate more closely with our European partners.”",1,1754317815.0,TheTicker,0,1.0,False

1mhf0en,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mhf0en/explore_revelook_coffee_filters_review_are_these/,Explore Revelook Coffee Filters Review Are These the Best Disposable Choice?,"The **Revelook qy-Bcfilters01 Coffee Filter** is an unassuming product that fits seamlessly into daily coffee brewing rituals but promises pure, uncompromised flavor. Testing these coffee filters in my drip coffee maker over the span of a week revealed a lot about their performance, usability, and value. While they're currently a staple in my morning routine, there were some hiccups worth noting. Here's everything I discovered during this deep dive into basket-style coffee filters.

**Design and Material Quality**  
These filters are made from biodegradable paper, making them eco-friendly and entirely free from chlorine or unnecessary chemicals. Honestly, this was one of the aspects that initially made me try them out. It's nice not needing to worry about contributing to the mountain of non-biodegradable trash while enjoying my coffee. The material feels sturdy enough for its purpose; in fact, even when brewing batch after batch, none of the filters ever ripped, tore, or collapsed inside the coffee maker. They’ve got just the right amount of thickness—no weak coffee here!  

**Ease of Use**  
These disposable filters are an absolute breeze to use. They fit snugly in my 12-cup basket-style coffee maker without requiring any adjustments. Taking the filters out was just as easy. The cleanup process? Let's just say it’s incredibly satisfying to pull the entire thing out in one piece with the grounds intact—no soggy disasters or grumbles about wet coffee sludge stuck at the bottom.  

Check [Revelook qy-Bcfilters01 Coffee Filter] on Amazon now.

**Fit and Versatility**  
The filters claim to be compatible with most 8-12 cup electric drip coffee makers, and let me tell you, that claim holds up. I tried them on a friend’s coffee machine—also basket-style—and the experience was just as smooth. They measure 7.875 inches when laid flat and fit like a glove in devices with basket-style holders. The design strikes a wonderful balance between universal compatibility and perfect performance.  

**Highlights**  
- Environment-friendly and compostable.  
- Sturdy construction; no rips or leaks.  
- Fits most 8-12 cup drip coffee makers with ease.  
- Cleanup couldn't be simpler.  

**Flavor Experience**  
When it comes to the actual coffee brewed using these filters, the taste truly impressed me. The flat-bottom design ensures even extraction, so every cup brewed was equally smooth, rich, and free of bitterness. I didn’t experience any grit or grounds sneaking into the pot, which can be an annoyance with some cheaper options. These filters truly give the coffee a clean taste, free from foam or oils that might dilute the experience.  

**Negatives**  
- The number of filters (100-count) could feel insufficient for large families or coffee fanatics—you might run through them quickly.  
- Packaging was generic and lacked resealability; it’s necessary to store them properly to keep them clean.  
- While sturdy enough, they're single-use only, which won’t work for folks trying to go zero waste.  

**Competing Products**  
When compared to reusable basket filters, these disposables offer a cleaner cup of coffee without oils or sediments but lack the sustainability factor. I’ve also used some slightly cheaper disposable filters from lesser-known brands, but the brewing experience with those was hit-or-miss. Some fell apart midway, spilling grounds into the pot—an absolute dealbreaker. The Revelook filters, in terms of consistent performance, are much more reliable. However, premium alternatives like Melitta filters might provide a minor improvement in taste clarity, though at a slightly higher price point.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Speaking of price-to-quality ratio, these filters fall into a sweet spot. While I wouldn’t call them ""budget,"" they’re affordable yet perform on par with premium options. Given their environment-friendly construction and consistency in delivering mess-free, rich cups of coffee, they justify their value. They’re worth every penny purely for peace of mind during cleanup (not scrubbing grounds stuck in your coffee maker would make anyone happy).

1mhey0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/pinkscare/comments/1mhey0j/i_feel_like_society_is_getting_more_selfish_and/,I feel like society is getting more selfish and it's making me sad,"I went to barnes and noble the other day to get one of those stupid books you fill out with/for your best friend, usually filled with memories or things you like about each other or whatever. I've gotten and given quite a few of these when I was a kid, I thought it would be silly to give one to my cousin for her bday this year. I was expecting them, between coffee table books & crossword puzzles, but I didn't. I went to the journal section, the kid section, and the gift section. The gift section had one teeeeeny tiny book (it's barely larger than the size of my palm) called ""My bestie, if you were..."" and you fill out the pages saying things like ""If you were ice cream you'd be vegan because you're cruelty free"" or some bullshit lol. 

Anyway, the lack of these silly friend books isn't the only thing that made me sad. In place of them (I also noticed a LOT fewer writing prompt books than there used to be, I wonder what else is missing that I didn't notice), there were soooooooo many books about facing social anxiety, feeling lonely/isolated, self care, & self esteem....  Like I feel like the cure to that would be to remember to fill out a list of 100 reasons why you love your best friend and give it to her, not to curl up on your couch alone with wine and read affirmations about why you don't need anybody else....

Idk. I can't write more eloquently about it atm, but I do want to whine because it's been bugging me. I'm particularly sensitive to this sort of thing right now for a thousand reasons, but I do feel sad about how self isolating people seem to be these days. It's not natural or healthy. I'm gonna go text my best friend that I love her. 🩷",37,1754317648.0,pinkscare,8,0.97,False
