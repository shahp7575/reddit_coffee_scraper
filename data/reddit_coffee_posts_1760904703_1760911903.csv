1ob2o6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1ob2o6g/i_want_to_run_away_from_my_toxic_parents/,I want to run away from my toxic parents,"I've just now been realizing how toxic my parents are. They aren't toxic in a very obvious kind of way. They give me house, food, indulge me in most of my wants. But we always fight, it's not like I'm a bad kid, I always do whatever they say but sometimes I make mistakes. I study hard, i don't talk to them disrespectfully, don't drink, smoke or do drugs. I even tell them whenever I'm going out because that's what they want, even if it's just to buy toilet paper at the store. I never make plans without asking for their permission. What they always get mad about is they say that I'm don't appreciate what they do for me. Because sometime I forget to the little things like change the dog's water or mame my bed one morning, forget to say thank you one time. To me, even though I don't only make those mistakes one time and never do it again, it's just so minor to me. But they get mad, they tell me how much they spend on my tuition fee, how they buy the food I want, and they give me an allowance. It's not just them mentioning this to me, it's them yelling it at me over and over, sometimes it takes hours. They're mad so they make stand in front of them while they tel how disappointed they are at me for not being a good daughter. They bring all of my faults even the ones I have corrected. For example, they want me to text them whenever I ride the bus and arrive at school. On the orientation day of my university, I was running late. I texted them that I was on my way to school but I didn't get a chance to text them when I arrived. Since then, I text them updates on where I'm going, everytime I change buses, if I'm going out of school for five minutes duringunch to buy coffee, everything I text them. They still bring it up when they get mad. They something along the lines of, ""You don't text use where you're going, you've only been doing that because we got mad at you."" I don't get why they feel the need to bring up a small mistake that I did in the past and corrected. It's really emotionally draining because for them it's not just telling me off for something I did wrong. They make me feel guilty for asking them for stuff, for everything they do for me. When I try to explain or sometimes I lose my temper and fight back, they tell that I'm basically worthless that I wouldn't be able to achieve anything without them or that I'm young, I haven't achieved anything yet so I have no right to talk back. This does not happen occasionally this happens at least once a week. To the point that all I think about when we're not arguing is when are they gonna get mad at me again, that I shouldn't get used to us not arguing because when we do it'll make me more sad when we do. 

I recently opened up to my friend about this and they were shocked about the stuff my parents would say to me. At first I thought it just because of a clutural difference because I'm asian amd my friend is white. But I realized, I'm oy really happy when I'm not with them, when I don't have to worry about my every move. 

I'm eighteen, I just started university. I still live with them. I don't have a job yet but I've been applying, I haven't been able to get a job before because of certain restrictions with my visa. But I just don't know what to do anymore, I'm very tired of the constant arguing. I want to be able to just live freely. Can anyone give me advice? Should i not run away? Am I being dramatic?",1,1760911703.0,toxicparents,0,1.0,False
1ob2nr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1ob2nr9/aitah_for_getting_upset_when_my_bestfriend/,AITAH for getting upset when my best-friend abruptly cancelled a planned trip we made for me visit her?,"Hii, I’ve been a listener of Two Hot Takes podcast for a few years now but this is my first time actually using Reddit & writing a post!! This story happened a few months ago and I’ve accepted how things have played out but I have been curious what the people of Reddit will think about it .. if there’s any new perspectives or advice I could get. Has anyone been through a similar situation? Please share! I’m sorry for the lengthy post in advance!


Starting with some context, I (23 F) have known Amy (fake name/ 22F) for years now since highschool. We were in sports together which naturally made us closer and we really started to become best friends after I graduated - peak covid year. There seemingly had never been any problems in our friendship before; anyone whose been in my life has known she was my best friend even if they had never met her and it was the same vice versa especially when Amy went to University and told her new friends about me (and how much she loves my dog). Well- uni is where she met her current boyfriend. I believe they’ve been dating for about almost 3 years now and Amy moved into a new apartment with him in January. Her boyfriend is from the city of the university Amy went to which is a few hours away from our hometown, and that’s where she ended up moving. Amy was excited about the move and told me I was always invited, especially for her birthday which now that she has her own place we’d be able to do whatever we wanted with no restrictions.


In March, my relationship ended and I was feeling low about it. Amy sent me flowers and my favorite snacks to cheer me up. We were talking on the phone more during this time when Amy mentions that she has no idea what she wants to do for her birthday and I tell her I’ll go visit her! She grew excited hearing this (I think she must’ve been unsure whether I wanted to/ or would be able to with everything going on but I was very excited as well to get out of town, destress and hang out with my bestfriend). And this is where the actual story starts ..


Amy and I started planning the activities we wanted to do once i was there, and what she wanted to do for her birthday. I then asked her if she or her boyfriend wanted to have a more romantic 1-on-1 day on her birthday. I was trying to be understanding knowing that this is their first year living together and assured her I could always visit before or after her birthday. She then tells me no, that her boyfriend hadn’t said anything about that either and that she really missed me and wanted me to be there for her actual birthday. I felt reassured and tell her if anything changes to let me know so we can plan something else in advance. That’s pretty much how our convos continued. She told me many times how much she wanted me to be there & missed me and even wanted me to bring more friends along. She had really expressed how she wanted to have a nice rooftop dinner and a full table. Everyone of my friends who were an option unfortunately couldn’t make it but I told her she should invite her friends from uni! Amy told me she didn’t really talk to anyone from uni and her only “friends” were her boyfriend’s friends’ girlfriends which she didn’t really consider her friends. I encouraged her to text any girls from school she was friends with on instagram and to invite them for a coffee or brunch! She then could invite them for her birthday dinner and it would also help for her to have people to go out with and not feel lonely since she just moved to a new town. 


Amy’s birthday is at the end of May; at this point it was around the end of April and now I was really figuring out what dates I’d be out of town to request some time off work. I planned to stay there for 5 days and I sent her the dates asking if that was okay with her- she tells me that it’s perfect and that was the plan all along. In this same conversation she tells me that her boyfriend had given her the option of choosing a surprise expensive gift or an expensive activity. She chose the expensive activity and asked for any hints on what it could be but he wouldn’t budge and say that it would ruin the surprise. We were trying to figure out what the activity could possibly be and I joked about him getting a hotel or a couples massage while I’m awkwardly third wheeling .. 


I then asked if the activity would be something for all 3 of us to do though, and said even if they did decide they wanted to go out themselves before or for the birthday dinner that I was okay with staying at their apartment or doing something else meanwhile. I also asked if he was already aware I was coming to visit. She said she had the same question for him about the activity since he did know I was coming at that point. Her words were that he had said “Yes, I know she’s coming already and the activity will be something all 3 of us can do”. I feel reassured once again and tell her I’m officially taking time off work. The plan was set and was really looking forward to it ..


2 weeks before my trip, I wake up to a string of texts. She responded to previous texts but then asks me if I remember when we were trying to figure out what the activity her boyfriend had planned was - well - “He did get me a hotel night” were her exact words with excitement. She told me on a Wednesday that he had told her on Monday he finalized the booking and her excuse for him was that he had planned this before he knew I was coming. The new plan that she made was that I’d leave on the morning of her birthday .. while still going out to the club for a special event the night before. I’d only visit for 2 days basically in total.


 I was very confused on why he would say he had something planned for all 3 of us and then go book a hotel night and that’s what I told her. I called her around 11 am that day to better understand the situation but I got no answer. I texted her after asking if we could call to better plan things out. I get no response until the next day in the evening. She apologizes she missed my call and tells me she started a new job and didn’t have time (thru text). She explains further that her boyfriend was stuck in between 2 activities and once he started budgeting he leaned more towards the hotel, so he didn’t know exactly what option he was picking at first. Which I can understand but why would he even reassure it’s okay for me to be there in the first place? It didn’t make sense to me. 


I get that plans can change but this felt very unnecessary and inconsiderate. I felt and still feel that I was rightfully upset about this. Even tho I was upset tho, I wasn’t trying to argue with my friend. I explained to her why I was stressed out by the change of plans ( I get car sick easily already and if she still wanted to go to the club the night before, the thought of me possibly being hungover in the car was already giving me a headache). I also found it unrealistic that we’d even wake up early enough to go out for breakfast before I leave (part of her plan) after being up so late the night before. Also adding the fact that my dad would be the one picking me up and would probably be there by midday. Amy did ask when I’d be free to call and I tell her I’d be free to call on Sunday. I was working 2 jobs during this time and although during the night I was free, I did assume she wouldn’t be able to call/ or wouldn’t want to since anytime before that when she did move in with her boyfriend, she would usually end the calls once he was home or when she’d pick him up from work. And Sunday I had the whole day off.


I get no response from her until the next week on a Tuesday. Granted I did forget it was going to be Mother’s Day that Sunday I told her I’d be free. I was just finding it more and more odd how she couldnt make just a bit of time to better plan out a trip that she had changed. So, that Tuesday she tells me she was out all day for Mother’s Day (I understand) and she cancels on me a week before I’m supposed to go bc of work. I told her I understand how the things that have happened have been mostly out of her control but that I was upset, and this  could’ve been avoided if there was better communication from her and her boyfriend’s part. And how I found it very inconsiderate that her boyfriend would book a hotel knowing at that point that I was coming to visit. She responded the next day that she understood my feelings and that she was very sorry for the miscommunication on her part and that I’m invited any other weekend. If I had just seen this text I would’ve took it for what it is or more easily gotten past it but on this same day, I noticed that she reposted a TikTok that couldn’t have been aimed to anyone else but me. It rubbed me the wrong way and made me read her texts differently tbh. I couldn’t tell if it was genuine.


Tell me if I just took it the wrong way? I get it with a dinner, with a hang out but with a trip we had planned where I bought new outfits, was sending her restaurant recommendations bc she had no idea where to eat, where I asked more than once if she had something more intimate planned with her boyfriend and I was reassured every single time how she wanted me there present to celebrate her birthday.. I just didn’t get it. What really rubbed me the wrong way is that I’m not a naggy friend; I was trying to communicate to her that I was upset and that I wasn’t that okay with what happened but I still love her at the end of the day, this was my first time even telling her that I was upset with her about something. She told me she would be in town after her birthday and we could hang out and I agreed. I was going to wait till I saw her in person to talk about it.


I still ended up going on the trip out of town. I made my own plans to go shopping at the huge malls and went to that same club we had planned to go to. I assumed she wouldn’t be there to be honest since she had said she’d be out working all day. I didn’t think much of it clearly and I did end up seeing her right away in the bathroom. She was 2 people in front of me in line and hadn’t seen me yet. I would never act like I didn’t know her so ofc I went up and said hi. She was obviously surprised and asked what I was doing there and told me she was feeling the alcohol she drank. We end up in different stalls and I don’t see her again till I’m by the dance floor. I recognize her bf (my first time ever seeing him in person) and I realize she’s right next to him. I go up to her again to say hi and tell her I wasn’t mad at her but just upset with the whole situation and mostly annoyed with what her boyfriend decided to do. She says she understands and that we can still be friends tho and asked how long I’d be in town for. I tell her and mention to hang out when she’s in town like she had said before and we’d talk better about what happened then. I tell her I’m going to get a drink at the bar and that it was nice seeing her. I spend the rest of the night at a different section and don’t see her again. 


The next day I was immensely hungover after blacking out the night before and thought if she did want to see me she could text me since she knew I was in town. I hadn’t heard from her since the last time I texted her and the whole day I was fighting for my life from nausea and feeling like I had an upset stomach at the mall. It isn’t until later in the night when I’m back in my hotel room that I actually stare at the date in the phone and realize it’s her birthday. I felt bad and also overstimulated with the mess I had in my room knowing I had to leave the next morning. I know i could’ve texted her once I saw it was her birthday and I know I did mess up on that. I got distracted with organizing all my things and texted her latee at night happy birthday. It was a brief text bc at that point I was unsure of where we stood but I explained I had forgot and that hopefully we’d see eachother soon and I wished her the best always, happy-bday. I got no response nor did she text me when she was in our home town to hang out. 2 weeks later I noticed she unfollowed me off my spam account on insta but still kept me on my main account. She did not remove me as a follower as well. And I texted her that I didn’t know why she was being so weird with me and that I had noticed she unfollowed me, and if that’s how she wanted to be with her best friend so be it. I still got no response from her. 


I know telling her a late happy birthday may have come across as me being petty but that really was not my intention. Our friendship fallout did really hurt me especially with a mix of other incidents/emotions I was going thru during that time. Maybe I could’ve said more as well idk; what do you guys think? Was i wrong to get upset? I feel like I didn’t do anything wrong but maybe I’m missing something and if I am, I’m open to what u guys have to say.",1,1760911673.0,TwoHotTakes,2,0.99,False

Basically, I simply drink black coffee in the morning at work, you know from keurig or say drip coffee from a cafe or gas station. I like good taste but not really an enthusiast. 

Recently, I changed my jobs and the new office doesnt have a coffee machine, so I was thinking of buying either keurig, french press, or aeropress. 

I am leaning towards aero press because of easy cleaning and tbh cheap (just buy ground coffee and drink lol). My only concern is: I need about 500-600 ml serving and typically for keurig, I’d just run the same pod twice. For Aeropress, the cup/serving sizes confuse me, so does the method. 

Do I make 4 servings (10oz) in the aeropress and add water? Or do I run make multiple batches? Also the image (attached to post) is quite confusing. Can someone please help? 95ml makes me think I need to run the whole process 6 times to get the same coffee I’d want.

- You use a higher water temperature than with pourover
- The AeroPress retains much more of that heat
- You grind way finer than pourover
- You let it steep for minutes instead of having rather short water contact
- You use pressure to get the water through rather than relying on gravity

All these factors should cause more extraction, right? So how come the coffee is not excessively overextracted, but tastes actually good?

I am trying to understand what is going on here to improve my brews both with the AeroPress and the V60.",4,1760911220.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

1ob2ehy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AotearoaNewZealand/comments/1ob2ehy/the_death_of_discussion/,The death of discussion,"So as I sit here enjoying my coffee at the local after a ride on the bike I can’t help but reflect on my mornings reddit experience. 

As many of you here I frequented the banned sub from which we have come here from. 

I didn’t agree with a lot of what was posted and was vocal when I didn’t. 

But in comparison with r/newzealand and now I find r/kiwipolitics, a differing opinion was never silenced. Mocked, questioned, and downvoted yes but not silenced. 

Amazingly I was never banned from r/newzealand but I was threatened with it, had comments deleted and was suspended. 

I was critical, sarcastic, and called out bullshit for what it was but I always tried to attack the argument not the person. Unless they were categorically being a cock. 

But I was surprised to find myself banned from kiwipolitics for a sarcastic comment, maybe an abrasive one but pretty bloody mild for what’s out in the world and the body of the comment was well thought out counter points to the OP’s post. 

I won’t go into details of the post but what I’m getting at is the death of discussion. 

I don’t care that I’m banned, reddit for me is an alternative to reading shampoo bottles while I’m on the porcelain throne or shitty magazines in doctors waiting rooms etc. 

I’m of the age where I’ve experienced the real world, before cell phones and social media. 

I’ve punched and been punched, I’ve formed my own opinions and had them challenged. I’ve had to interact with people I detest and apologise to people I’ve offended. 

But I’ve never been able to simply silence someone. To ban them or mute them, to surround myself with like minded people and avoid any conflict. 

I worry for the chronically online, while avoidance is the easy way out they’re doing themselves a disservice. Sooner or later life is going to present them with a situation they can’t ban themselves out of. 

Then what? They’ve never had to navigate around a differing opinion, they can’t emphasise or see others viewpoints. So they freak out. The name calling, the labelling, the screeching. 

No one wins in this situation. 

If you have an argument or an opinion, put it out there to be challenged. If it stands up then it has merit. If you need to restrict commentary then it’s weak. 

Like I said, being banned doesn’t phase me in the slightest, shit being off reddit would probably be better for me. 

But those others. I really do worry for them and the world they live in. 

What’s my point? I don’t know. 

Maybe remember that reddit is a snapshot of a specific group of people that is certainly encouraging a certain viewpoint. 

Encourage discussion and welcome different perspectives. You’ll never grow if you stay comfortable. 

Anyway I have to get back on the bike before it pisses down.

1ob2eab,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToEMS/comments/1ob2eab/maybe_this_isnt_the_career_for_me/,Maybe this isn’t the career for me,"I’ve been an EMT for almost 8 months and today is my last day with my company. I work for the largest ambulance service in my state and we do 911 and transports. My main station is super cliquey and they’re always talking shit about other EMTs. I’m quiet (and maybe a little autistic 😅) and keep to myself, but I overhear so much. I’ve never really connected with anyone. I didn’t even tell anyone that it’s my last day. 

I switched careers for this and I really enjoyed EMT school. I did really well in class, got a high score on my state test, and even passed the NREMT in 70 questions on my first try, but it kind of feels like a waste now. I really thought I’d enjoy this job even though I knew I’d be older than most new EMTs, but I feel like I wasn’t properly prepared for actually working in the field. I had like 9 or 10 different trainers and most of them were also pretty new. They even gave me a few trainees starting after my second ever cleared shift which I thought was insane. 

My coworkers here are miserable and I didn’t realize how much that would affect my own mental health. I recently started a part-time job at a coffee shop and I enjoy it so much more. I actually talk to people there and my mood is so much better. I’ve even made plans to hang out with some of those coworkers outside of work. I also get paid better there which is pretty ridiculous.

This job just doesn’t pay enough for the BS we have to deal with and I knew that coming into it, but I didn’t realize that the people I worked with would be the ones who made it that much more difficult. Even most of the firefighter/paramedics we respond with and the nurses and other hospital staff are assholes. I’ve interacted with firefighters before I became an EMT and I know nurses and I always really looked up to them and thought they were great, but it feels like these guys look down on us because we’re “just EMTs”. Maybe it’s this area (I’m kind of new here) or maybe it’s just the reputation of my company (it’s not a good one).

If you made it this far, thanks for reading and I apologize for the long rant and if I seem like I’m just complaining. It’s just been a really disheartening 8 months. I really don’t want to lose my skills or turn away completely from EMS, but I know I don’t want to be here anymore. I wonder if I’d do better in a rural/small town or even a volunteer service. I wish I worked with more experienced EMTs and/or Paramedics who were willing to teach rather than just putting people down. 

I’m open to any constructive advice. ",2,1760911016.0,NewToEMS,2,1.0,False

I was pointing out his behavior and mentioned I was worried he might try something.  
  
I (37F) don't think I'm the asshole or overreacting in this situation, but I could be wrong. Please let me know if I'm in the wrong for being annoyed at this group.

So here was what happened. It's a beautiful fall Sunday morning. There's a small breakfast spot on the corner, line out the door. I'm by myself, walking up and about to get in line, when a car pulls up and two women (20-somethings) jump out, practically run to get in front of me, and then proceed to take up the entire sidewalk so I cannot pass and walk as slowly as possible. Fine, whatever. Some people just aren't aware of their surroundings. I just want my coffee and to get on with my day.

So we're waiting in line when two guys walk up, make a show of walking around me. I don't know how to explain it; it was just very exaggerated. I think to myself, of course, they're together. I must have let out a sigh and didn't even realize I had until one of the guys turned to me and asked if I said anything. I didn't even recognize that he was speaking to me at first. Confused, I told him no, I didn't say anything - because I hadn't. Then he starts raising his voice and clenching his hands, his face getting red. ""Yes, you did, you sighed! She sighed!"" Then he points to one of the women. ""That's my wife!"" over and over again. I am a tall person (5'10), and this guy stood a full head higher than me.

I kind of just stare at him because I'm not really sure how to react. Like, what is this? Who cares if someone sighs? I'm also wondering if he might swing at me because of the continued pointing and clenching his hands. Wife chimes in, kind of condescending, and asks if I want to go ahead of them. I think she was trying to embarrass me, but I just wanted to get away from this dude (also, coffee. I really wanted my coffee).

So I said, ""You know what, yes, thank you,"" and walked right through their group. I looked back to make sure there was enough distance between me and this guy. He proceeds to yell, ""What are you looking at? You got what you wanted. Why are you staring?"" I admit this made me look in his direction a bit longer, along with everyone in the shop. Since he kept pressing, I said, ""You know, you're kind of... an ass."" I then turned and ignored the group. I could kind of hear them talking shit and the wife cooing over this man's bruised ego (can we call someone who acts like this a man?).

I go through life trying to mind my business and give people the benefit of the doubt. But at this point, I'm having a hard time giving any of them that. The more I think about this, the guy already had a story in his head, knew their actions were iffy, and was gearing up for a fight.

I also wonder if he was annoyed that I was ignoring their behavior as a group. Like he's one of those people who goes through life trying to get a rise out of everyone? Idk, annoyed more than anything. Why do people act like this?",1,1760910996.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

They said they didn’t rinse it out for one month and I was confused. They told me you should run a table spoon of vinegar and a cup of water through a coffee maker at least once a month. I’ve never thought of cleaning my coffee maker, I had a small one that I’ve been using for 15 years straight and only recently bought a new one. I don’t have any health complications, I only got sick like one day last year and that was the first time in nearly a decade or so I can think of. 

I had an older coffee maker so I’m not sure if I needed to clean it with vinegar or if I need to do that with the new one. Should I, and how often? Are there any other cleaning things I should do with it?

1ob25gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1ob25gk/its_been_a_while/,It’s been a while.,"Almost 12 years now. I don’t even know why I thought of you. What we were building, what we were hoping to do together. But I was at work, going over numbers, going over everything I’ve done this year. And it hit me. Everything we talked about, everything we wanted to do. And then it hit me. You, hit me.

I’m almost there. I’m so close I can almost grab it. But I’m terrified it’s all just going to run through my fingers like sand, again. 

Since that day, my life has been failure after failure. There was a year or two where every morning I got up, sat at my coffee table with a glass of whiskey and my revolver side by side. Deciding “which one is it today?” Turns out, there’s a flaw in my revolver. The cylinder gets stuck unless you cock back the hammer. I didn’t know, and that’s the only reason I’m still here. Made me laugh, that the only reason I’m still alive is because of a flaw. Not a choice, a mistake in manufacturing. 

Well, fast forward a few years. I sold off all my assets and went all in on building a business. Sold everything off at the end of 2019. I didn’t pay attention to the news and didn’t care about the new “bird flu” on the horizon. Go figure, the week I was going to sign the five year lease on the building I was going to use as my headquarters, Covid lockdowns came. All the contracts I had made before this point, up in smoke. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment sitting in a warehouse, waiting to be moved in, installed and put to work? Useless. 

Everything I had done and planned for over the course of the last 6-8 months instantly went to shit. Took me about another four months to liquidate everything, for maybe 1/3 the price I originally paid for. I ended up working about 110hrs a week that entire time. Maybe a few months more just while I was figured out what to do next and to try and recover some of the losses. It was a good distraction at least.

Decided to start another business. Got the building first, hired contractors, retrofitted everything and was up and running months after the lockdowns happened. Late 2020. Think it was October or November.  

Had to take a seven figure loan to afford everything. And for a little while? I thought I had made it then. Was making about 50k a month, but I was playing it safe. Kept most of it in reserve and paid off the debt service at twice the rate I needed to. 

Well, it worked great, until it didn’t. I had enough money in reserve to last a while, but when it was almost out, I had to make a tough choice. Take a loan,  push forward and hope the market turned soon, or fold. I decided to fold, but looking back? That was the wrong choice. Hindsight is always 20/20. Makes me wonder if you would have told me to keep going or just told me you’d back me whatever I chose. Would I have made the same choice?

I finally paid off the debt earlier this year. Worked my ass off the last three or so years to do so. I was desperate. Afraid I would end up homeless again. Glad you weren’t here so I didn’t have you or our kid to worry about. But, if you had both lived, would I have taken the same risks? Would I have gone “all in?” 

And now, here I am. I made almost 50k last week alone. Still living off the same 3500 budget a month I’ve been living off of since 2020. Yesterday, I withdrew most of what I made this week and thought about what I wanted to buy. I still wear the same clothes I did back then. That one shirt you hated, now looks like Swiss cheese. Was more holes than shirt. I threw it away, finally. You’d probably cheer. Thing is, I don’t “want” anything. You know I never gave a shit about fancy clothes, or cars or “stuff.” Maybe I’ll go on a long vacation. Not sure where, could just go to the airport, take the first international flight that accepts American passports and just, go for however long I feel like it. Might even buy business class, even though we used to balk at how crazy the prices are to just… sit on a plane. 

I’m almost there. But you’re not here. I can’t be the stay at home dad I wanted to be. You never got to be the stay at home mom you wanted to be. And that’s the only thing I ever wanted. Almost twelve years building, and it all just feels… empty without you. ",2,1760910413.0,letters,1,1.0,False
1ob25a5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cablemod/comments/1ob25a5/question_about_12v2x6_connector_for_potential/,Question about 12v-2x6 connector for potential melting,"Hi, 

I smelled a bitter smell the other night in my room almost like used coffee grounds. It could’ve been coming from outside as my AC is in meaning that my window is always open and the way my AC goes into my window, air from outside will flow through. I play at 1080p with my 5090 and hardly ever pull 200W, but still anxious about it all.

However, given what we know about 5090s and the 12v-2x6 connector, it could’ve also been my connector melting. My question is, should I just check the GPU end of the connector and if that’s good then plug it back in and not worry about it? Or, do I need to check both the GPU end and the PSU end of the connector?

Only reason I ask is because checking the PSU end requires me to move my PC downstairs to a specific room where I work on it at while just checking the GPU won’t require me to move it at all. So this answer will inform me of my next steps.

Thanks so much!",1,1760910402.0,cablemod,0,1.0,False

***Thursday***

“No one’s asking you to,” Lar’ee said, willing Boyd to understand something he couldn’t possibly comprehend without all the facts. “You might be right. These people might not have you in their sights at all. But—no, let me finish,” he said as Boyd’s mouth shot open. He waited until the big guy closed his mouth again before continuing. “Right now, I follow Robbie whenever he leaves the apartment. I’m discreet and I keep my distance, but nothing goes anywhere near him that’s a danger to him, so long as I’m breathing. Or even *not* breathing, depending on the situation.”

He’d hoped the joke would land, but Robbie’s frown told him just how ridiculous he was being. Of the two, Robbie was the easier one to rationalise with, since he understood his place in the universe. So Lar’ee shifted his focus to the red-headed foodie.

“Think bigger than yourself, Red,” he said, using Yitzak’s nickname for Robbie to inform him of where this was going. “The last time your pop lost someone dear to him, he was so inconsolably furious that World War One broke out, and then he crumbled into depression afterwards, taking the whole world with him.”

Boyd straightened up. “He caused World War One?”

“The mortals found their own reasons for acting the way they did, but the underlying emotional current was his. His heartache was so profound, not even the seclusion rings could keep it from seeping into the mortal population. Would you really do that to him and our homeworld again, just to keep your autonomy?”

Robbie looked at the coffee table in front of him and shook his head.

Lar’ee continued. “Like I said. I’m discreet. You don’t even know I’m there. I’m happy for you to interact without a care in the world, so long as I’m there to make sure it doesn’t bite you in the ass.” His gaze moved to Boyd. “And I’m willing to do the same thing for you. You can still go out and live your life—just give me a heads-up when you do so that I can keep watch from a distance.”

“But that’s what I’m talking about,” Boyd cut in, slapping his knees in frustration. “You follow Robbie because his pop is a god and could influence the world badly if anything happened to him. I don’t have that problem. My father wants me dead. If anything, he’d throw my killers a party.”

Lar’ee’s chest constricted painfully, and across from him, Robbie turned and wrapped his arms around Boyd like he was the most precious thing in the world. To some people, he was. “Your mother might wish that,” Lar’ee said carefully. “And in the beginning, your father might have felt that way too, but I promise you, it’s different now. *They’re* different now. And they won’t hold your love for Lucas against you.”

“You haven’t met my dad.”

“Oh, but I have,” Lar’ee countered. “Many times.”

“So, you think I should just whip out my phone and call Colonel Adam Masters from the USMC, because he’s going to throw his arms open and welcome me back? Knowing his father beat nine shades of shit out of me when I was a teenager?”

Lar’ee opened his mouth, only to close it again. “I didn’t say that,” he finally said.

 Boyd waved the denial away. “It doesn’t matter. The bottom line, there’s no huge overarching threat of devastation if anything happens to me, is there?”

“There will be, and not just because of how much you mean to your original roommates. Look at Llyr. He’s the most … *Mystallian* out of all of them, yet he looks out for you because you spent years looking out for Sam. And what about Sam? You think he’s going to let it slide if they figure out where you are and kill you? He’ll spend the rest of eternity locked in the Prydelands, or until the ones who killed you die of old age—because his righteous rage won’t back down from anything less. You honestly believe that won’t happen?”

“I won’t be too happy with them either, big guy,” Robbie added quietly. “And I’ll have a bigger head start on them than Sam will.”

*The hell you will,* Lar’ee thought, but since things were going his way, he held his tongue. Instead, he looked at Boyd. “See? You matter to people who will burn the world for you. As much as I don’t want anything to happen to you, I don’t want to have to deal with that fallout either. I’m not asking you to stop, Boyd. I’m just asking you to give me a heads-up. You can forget all about it once you do, because you. Will. Never. See. Me.” He punctuated each word with a poke against the chair arm. “Not if you don’t want to. Just treat it like telling Robbie you’re running to the store for five minutes.”

“And once this thing with these assholes is sorted, you’ll back right off?”

“I can’t promise the future any more than you can. Will something else crop up to take their place? I don’t know. Will I ever stop worrying about you now that you know what I’m capable of? I don’t know. It used to be easier in some ways when you didn’t know, but it was also harder in others. You didn’t know the stakes before. Now, you don’t have that luxury.”

He watched Boyd intently, searching for any hints of what the big guy was thinking. “This morning just happened,” Boyd said slowly. “It wasn’t planned. We got held up at the gym, and Lucas didn’t have time to bring me home. It was a nice day, so I decided to walk instead of getting a ride.”

Lar’ee pressed his hands together and then bounced them open like he didn’t disagree. “And all of that is totally fine. I’m not trying to hobble you here. All I needed from you was to know your plans had changed. If you’d have called, or texted, or done anything to let me know, I wouldn’t have had to scramble all over the city looking for you.”

Robbie lifted away from Boyd. “We could add him to our friends’ group,” he suggested.

At Boyd’s tightening jaw, Lar’ee focused instead on Robbie. “What friends’ group?”

Robbie leaned sideways to dig out his phone and tapped the screen. “We all have the ‘Find My Friends’ app on our phones. It allows us to track each other. It’s how I found Lucas when he was out past Pittsburgh the night he and Boyd first got together.” When he was ready, he turned the phone towards Lar’ee to show him the pins on a map for each person in their household.

Lar’ee knew this step was pointless, and he was kicking himself for not calling Boyd to ask where he was. It could’ve been that simple. Instead of panicking, he could have taken a second to call.

Still, if they were prepared to *‘link him in’,* what did it matter if they knew where he was at any time? The worst he would be doing is something on behalf of the pryde, but what if they risked themselves looking for him? 

“I don’t know if I want you always knowing where I am,” Boyd said, echoing Lar’ee’s sentiments.

“And it might complicate things if I’m bouncing between my—my wards.”

Robbie frowned, his lips pinching in disapproval. “Does he still not know who you are?”

“He still doesn’t know who he is, no.”

“Meaning he doesn’t know,” Boyd huffed. “Don’t you think you’re stretching yourself just a little too thin between the three of us?”

“Which is why I exploded this morning, and I apologise for that.”

“That’s not the worst of it. You were so mad when you left, you realm-stepped right in front of those cops, and I had to use the phrase to cover for you.”

Lar’ee’s mouth fell open in shock. “No,” he said quickly, shaking his head— needing Boyd to understand that was not the case. “No, I’m not a Laffer anymore. Last night, the War Commander ordered me to change my name back to Nascerdios so I could do the work at the clinic using divine means.”

Robbie’s eyebrows disappeared beneath his hairline. “Wait, so Larry Laffer just ceases to exist now?”

“As soon as Nuncio resets the internet, yes.”

“Well, that would’ve been nice to know!” Boyd barked, but before he could stand up, Robbie quickly lifted his legs and laid them over Boyd’s lap, locking him into place.

“Be nice,” he pleaded, gently massaging Boyd’s neck. “Please?”

Boyd breathed deeply a few times, then relaxed. His glare at Lar’ee was glacial.  “Asshole,” he muttered under his breath.

*Lastchancelastchancelastchance…*

“I’m sorry that gave you a fright.” At Boyd’s curling lip, Lar’ee threw caution to the wind. “What else am I supposed to say here, Boyd? We hadn’t spoken since the War Commander made that ruling. I love you, and you scared the crap out of me, wandering through the city without telling anyone. And when I finally caught up to you, instead of admitting the mistake, you blew a gasket—and I was right there with you.”

“You yelled first,” Boyd snarled, leaning forward a few inches—dragging Robbie’s legs with him despite the way his heels were braced against the sofa arm. “It just about made me jump through the fuckin’ store window.”

Lar’ee bowed his head and covered his face with his hands. “You’re right,” he admitted, nodding to himself. “I *did* yell first. I was expecting you to be hurt or dead or kidnapped or something like what happened to Mason, and to find you waltzing down the street without a care in the world—I lost it.” He lowered his hands to look at Boyd. “You were supposed to be more careful than that.”

“I didn’t take the blowback into account, no,” Boyd admitted, then refocused on Robbie. “I need you to promise me that if anything happens, you won’t go off the rails avenging me. Sam’s going to need your help to get through—”

“Since that’s not gonna happen, I don’t have to promise spit,” Robbie countered, waving one finger in the air between all three of them like it had the final ruling. It came to rest on Boyd’s sternum. “Like it or not, you now matter to the divine. And just like everyone else connected to powerful people, if that means you need to go around with a divine bodyguard from now on, you’re gonna shut up and take the rammed bodyguard.” He arched an eyebrow. “Or do I have to get Lucas in on this argument about how important you are to us?”

Boyd ground his lips together. “You suck.”

“Like a black hole, baby,” Robbie promised with a chin-lift of absolute confidence.

Lar’ee snorted at the sexual pun, but the more he thought about it, the funnier it became. His laughter pulled the other two in until all three were laughing—and the tension between them finally cleared.

I’ve been on HRT since 12/09/23.

I am deeply longing for emotional connection & love, not sex. An EQUAL partnership. Something uncomplicated for once that makes me really feel content & safe, and feel like I’ve got a competent trusted person next to me who won’t break my heart for the millionth time. A life with a beautiful young woman by my side who won’t hurt me physically, emotionally, or financially like past partners.

Big into Video Games, RPGs, movies, WWII, reading, photography, shooting, bike riding, urban exploration.

I’m pretty shy, a little chubby but trying to work out more. I do suffer from Psoriasis but it’s mostly under control with medication. I hate smoking of tobacco, and usually only drink socially. 420 friendly as long as it isn’t your entire personality like my ex.

I love helping others. I admit, I need help with my social skills because of my upbringing, but I'm learning fast.

I’m only attracted to feminine appearing people. Not looking for anyone over 32 or under 21 unless showing a good level of maturity.

Not looking for long distance, I deeply crave non-sexual physical intimacy & fun activities together.

I am a switch. I am NOT Poly, only monogamous.

I (37F) don't think I'm the asshole in this situation, but I could be wrong. Please let me know if I'm in the wrong for being annoyed at this group.

So here was what happened. It's a beautiful fall Sunday morning. There's a small breakfast spot on the corner, line out the door. I'm by myself, walking up and about to get in line, when a car pulls up and two women (20-somethings) jump out, practically run to get in front of me, and then proceed to take up the entire sidewalk so I cannot pass and walk as slowly as possible. Fine, whatever. Some people just aren't aware of their surroundings. I just want my coffee and to get on with my day.

So we're waiting in line when two guys walk up, make a show of walking around me. I don't know how to explain it; it was just very exaggerated. I think to myself, of course, they're together. I must have let out a sigh and didn't even realize I had until one of the guys turned to me and asked if I said anything. I didn't even recognize that he was speaking to me at first. Confused, I told him no, I didn't say anything - because I hadn't. Then he starts raising his voice and clenching his hands, his face getting red. ""Yes, you did, you sighed! She sighed!"" Then he points to one of the women. ""That's my wife!"" over and over again. I am a tall person (5'10), and this guy stood a full head higher than me.

I kind of just stare at him because I'm not really sure how to react. Like, what is this? Who cares if someone sighs? I'm also wondering if he's going to try to swing at me because he keeps pointing and clenching his hands. Wife chimes in, kind of condescending, and asks if I want to go ahead of them. I think she was trying to embarrass me, but I just wanted to get away from this dude (also, coffee. I really wanted my coffee at this point).

So I said, ""You know what, yes, thank you,"" and walked right through their group. I looked back to make sure there was enough distance between me and this guy. He proceeds to yell, ""What are you looking at? You got what you wanted. Why are you staring?"" I admit this made me look in his direction a bit longer, along with everyone in the shop. Since he kept pressing, I said, ""You know, you're kind of... an ass."" I then turned and ignored the group. I could kind of hear them talking shit and the wife cooing over this man's bruised ego (can we call someone who acts like this a man?).

I go through life trying to mind my business and give people the benefit of the doubt. But at this point, I'm having a hard time giving any of them that. The more I think about this, the guy already had a story in his head, knew their actions were iffy, and was gearing up for a fight.

I also wonder if he was annoyed that I was ignoring their behavior as a group. Like he's one of those people who goes through life trying to get a rise out of everyone? Idk, annoyed more than anything. Why do people act like this?",2,1760909954.0,redditonwiki,1,0.75,False

You’ve probably had that moment: studied for hours, then forgot everything during the test 😩  
Don’t worry - it’s not your memory, it’s your *method*.

**1. Use active recall.**  
Don’t reread - *quiz yourself*. Close the book and try to explain the concept from memory.

**2. Spaced repetition.**  
Review material after 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month. That’s how long-term memory is built.

**3. Connect new info to something you know.**  
Your brain loves patterns. Relate new material to real-life examples or fun associations.

**4. Teach someone else.**  
If you can explain it simply, you truly understand it.

**5. Sleep. Seriously.**  
Memory consolidation happens while you rest - not during your third cup of coffee.

When you're 20 miles from nowhere and out of food, and you come to a highway, you hitch to town.   Some tips that have helped me, AND not burned the next guy looking for a ride:

* Be clean.  Carry wet-wipes, and do (at least) the face and armpits when attempting to hitch.  Carry an extra shirt; wear it.  You should not smell getting in the car.
* If your ride picks you up near a gas-station/store/etc, offer to buy coffees or drinks for the road.
* Try not to be obviously poor.   If you've got enough money to take care of yourself and are hitchhiking, its a romantic, poetic journey that people want to be a part of.  If you are hitching because you have no money and you look filthy and poor, you're just a vagrant; people won't want to deal with you.
* Know where you're going, and be flexible - maybe they are only going halfway, but you should know what that town is, and what options you'll have.  Be ok with that - if you got in the car, you're in it for the ride.
* Be polite.   Do not talk politics.   Do not smoke or fart in their car.   If prompted, tell stories of other rides you've gotten, or talk about why you're traveling - people love to be entertained.   Know when to shut up and be quiet.
* Be thankful.  For the person giving you the ride it's almost zero work, but its a huge favor for you.  Act like it and thank them.
* Be aware of the laws.  In the US at least, its illegal in a lot of places.   Don't be an ass to a police officer; often they will ignore or let you by, they might even help you.   Act like you have a plan.",2,1760909392.0,hitchhiking,0,1.0,False

1ob1mwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/pureretention/comments/1ob1mwq/stop_the_bleeding_asap/,Stop the bleeding ASAP,"While browsing SR message boards, I often see sentiments such as:

>""I've had a 60 day streak, but it's been so dirty. Should I just relapse and start clean?""

>""I peeked at porn today and edged for a while. Might as well finish.""

>""I relapsed yesterday and ended up doing it 3 more times today.""

Why does one mistake have to lead to so many others?

Apart from my year+ long SR streak, I've been caffeine-free for a similar amount of time.

This morning, was a bit of a special occasion because I had family in town. I ended up having a cup of coffee with my brother (first caffeine in months).

Because of this, later in the day, at lunch, I thought ""Oh well, already had a coffee this morning, might as well write the day off and have a couple of diet cokes with my tacos""

But then, God spoke to me and told me to **stop the bleeding**. And so I stopped. Didn't order that Diet Coke... and I'm SO glad I did.

Stopping the bleeding can apply to any addiction you're trying to quit. Just because you slip up a tiny bit doesn't mean you deserve an all-out relapse.

So, next time you catch yourself looking at some IG-thot's photos, please stop before you click into her onlyfan's account. If you have a wet dream, don't wake up and decide to PMO since you already relapsed.

WIBTA if I said “not worth my time?”


So definitely need some background. My SIL in law has been married to my brother (different bio dads) for about 15 years. They have two kids (15 and 11) together. 

She does not like my family. Especially my dad. To her credit, he would push boundaries as a grandparent and there were discussions and he truly has improved over the years, but she still has something against all of us. Her family lives abroad and I thought at first it might be a cultural difference but I’ve seen her interact with other parents and she’s very friendly and bubbly even. 

They live about 3.5- 4 hours from us. Anytime we visit for birthdays/holidays she makes herself scarce. As much as we try to kill her with kindness, she doesn’t give us the time of day.

When I was 6 months pregnant I passed through their city alone and asked to stop by to see them. She kept watching the tv show they were watching and didn’t really respond to my questions. My brother isn’t much of a talker so it was an awkward experience overall. I felt like a nuisance and left soon after. 

My brother supposedly had tried to talk to her about it but ultimately he said he’s afraid she’ll take the kids out of the country. Not sure she’d actually do this but she is stronger willed than him so really we just deal with it.

The thing that tipped me over the edge was I had my kids 1st birthday party a few weeks ago and I told my brother about it two months before that. I wasn’t sure if it was gonna be Saturday or Sunday but I let him know the weekend.

So the weekend before the party he texts me to say he’s torn because they have a baby shower for my SILs friend that same day and the timing won’t work with the driving. It just confirmed that my family isn’t a priority for them.

I am a little bitter because I spent years driving for my niece and nephew’s birthdays, monetarily supporting their PTA events, and now that I have my own kid, they haven’t shown up. And honestly I can’t say I’m surprised at the decision but it still hurt. 

Anyways, now she is texting that she just arrived to my city (I didn’t know she was coming) and wants to know if I have time for a coffee). 

What would you say? I’m inclined to ignore it completely and slowly phase them out until they can show they prioritize me and my family.

Breakfast - the usual porridge, with soya milk alongside yogurt and berries. Vanilla syrup coffee!! 10/10 (excuse the mess)

Lunch - Chicken salad sandwich, skips and an orange at my grannies 9/10

Snack - fresh sourdough, butter, jam with two babybels and strawberries yummm 10/10

Snack - Dark chocolate tunnock tea cake with a cuppa and a sparkling water 9/10

Dinner - Breaded chicken (a massive fear), mixed veg, rice and peas also added curry sauce and soy sauce (added extra rice as dad said I needed more) 8/10

Dessert - GU strawberry and clotted cream cheesecake (only managed 1/3-1/2, the lid was slightly inflated and then I convinced myself it was off and I didn't like it. It was in date and tasted and smelt fine but I think my ED was freaked out tbh) I made up for it with some milk bottles and chewy Percys. I think I will stick to chocolate or ice-cream lol 5/10

Snack - shreddies soya milk with yogurt and fruit! 10/10

Went to visit family today which was overwhelming to say the least, especially with so much uncertainty about whether I will be back in hospital and my illness. But I am glad I went and pushed myself to have lunch with them!

I am really struggling with food noise and hunger (see previous post) I feel like now I am eating too much and I don't deserve any extras, and I can feel my intake dropping ever so slightly. It is nothing dramatic and I am still sticking to the plan 100% but the last few days I was having SEVERAL handfuls of almonds, loads of sugar in my tea (the way I like it), extra sweets etc. whereas now my head is stopping me because I feel like its 'too much' and I feel to guilty yet I am so so hungry at times and want to eat food the way I like it, with lots of sauce, with sugar, with butter! I know things won't be perfect all the time but I wish I could get rid of this insatiable hunger and give myself full permission. I know the only way I can prove to my brain that it's okay to have extras is by eating them but it is just very overwhelming. I even feel guilty for writing this because I know I am eating a good bit, so I probably sound so greedy and ungrateful but I always want to be transparent! Also not helping my foot is still in AGONY lol!

I recently started taking ADHD meds after nearly 10 years of being off of them, and I'm running into a problem...

So, they work, BUT, they also end up giving me panic attacks/strong somatic symptoms.

Here's how my typical day on them (Focalin XR 20mg) goes: I wake up, drink one coffee, eat breakfast, take my meds, and start my day. For about 2-3 hours, I feel GREAT. I'm productive, happy, and calm.

Somewhere in my morning, I usually end up drinking another coffee. Sometimes I'm okay after this, sometimes I'm not. Either way, at some point during my morning/early afternoon, I'm spiraling into panic/anxiety.

Now, before starting meds, I drank coffee like a fish, without having any issues. This would lead me to believe that I have a strong tolerance to it.

So, my question is: what's to blame for my issues here? Obviously, I'm prone to anxiety/somatic issues, but is it my ADHD meds or the caffeine causing the problems?

For context, I still live at home, and will until next fall when I move out for college. The entirety of my mom's side of the family has fallen into conspiracies and it has started getting physically dangerous for them, let alone those who live around them. The thing that prompted this post was me catching my mom pouring raw milk into her and my (non-believing) dad's coffee. I begged her to please boil it at the very least and she said she would but I highly doubt it'll happen. This is really bad for me too, as I am high risk for viruses and infections and if there was something like a listeria outbreak in my house I'm the most likely to suffer severe, potentially life threatening consequences. It used to just be her family that was like this but I blame my moms new conspiracy theorist friends for getting her into this bs too. What do I even do about this? Has anyone ever successfully deprogrammed a relative before? I'm extremely concerned about my own safety but even more so about my moms, she's even gone full carnivore and I can only imagine what that has done to her cholesterol, there's a history of stroke in her family, this could very easily kill her. 

Any input is valued greatly, I'm just at such a loss for what can be done and needed to talk about it with people who've been there. No one I know understands what it's like to lose half your family this way. My mom is the only one I'm still in contact with, the rest of them have gotten so hateful it's impossible to be around them.

We plan to **rent a car (4WD or AWD)** for the entire time since it looks like rentals are around **$200–$300**, and buses seem long/complicated/expensive. If this is wrong or there are better options, please let me know! I’m comfortable driving in different terrains.

Rough plan below:

\~Considering skipping but would like a second opinion\~

* **San José** – I’ve read mixed reviews; seems like some people skip it. Worth spending time for the **Central Market**, **National Museum**, or **Gold Museum**, or better to skip? I'm considering just flying in and out of Liberia.
* Some itineraries suggest going west from here to **Jacó** or **Playa Herradura**, or down to **Manuel Antonio National Park**.
   * Are these drives worth it for a short trip?
* Is Jacó safe?

La Fortuna / Arenal (must visit)

* Visit **La Fortuna Waterfall**
* Enjoy some **hot springs** (**recommendations welcome!** I’ve seen mentions of Tabacón, EcoTermales, and free rivers like Río Chollín)
* **Hike Arenal Volcano** – Is a guide worth it, or can we do it on our own?
* Maybe do an **ATV tour** or other activities if they’re really worth it.

**Any “can’t-miss” experiences or lesser-known spots in this area? Particularly for rainforest / waterfall / hot springs?**

# Monteverde (must visit)

* Visit the **Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve** (day pass is $22)
* Stop at **Colibrí Café** for the hummingbirds
* Try **100% Aventura** for ziplining (looks like the best one?)

Any other unique experiences in this area? Coffee tours or night hikes maybe?

Guanacaste / Pacific Coast

We’d like to end (or begin and end) the trip on the coast. I’d love to try **scuba diving**, and found a shop called **Rocket Frog Divers** that offers a 2-day intro course for \~$160. Anyone tried them or have any other recommendations for trying out scuba for the first time in Costa Rica?

Also interested in:

* A **surf lesson** or beach day (suggestions please)
* Any other great activities in this area?

# Food + General Tips: We haven’t looked much at food yet, but we’re mainly in it for nature, adventure, and local/ecological experiences. Any “must-try” Costa Rican dishes, restaurants, or markets?

Final Questions

1. Is **driving this route (San José → La Fortuna → Monteverde → Guanacaste) or (Guanacaste** **→ Monteverde → La Fortuna → Guanacaste)** realistic in 10–12 days?
2. Are there any **roads we should avoid or that are too rough**, even with 4WD?
3. Would you **cut San José / Jacó / Manuel Antonio** to make the trip smoother?
4. Should we really buy sunscreen and bug spray ahead of time? We weren't planning on checking a bag but would consider sharing a checked bag if this makes the most sense.

We’re flexible and just want to experience as much of Costa Rica’s nature and wildlife as possible. Thanks so much in advance for any advice or itinerary tweaks!",2,1760908365.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

1ob18zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ob18zs/aitah_for_feeling_extremely_insecure_and_angry/,AITAH for feeling extremely insecure and angry that my husband had his “most magical young love moment” with his ex?,"My husband and I are both in our 30s and have been married for two years. We met when we were 30 and got married two years into dating.

We both have histories, mine less so, because I’ve chosen bad partners before due to low self-esteem, and nobody really wanted to take our relationship to the next level until I met my husband. He’s been the love of my life ever since. My husband’s past is different; he had a fiancée he had been with since he was 23, and they broke up because their relationship was impractical (long distance). I’ve felt a bit insecure, since he’s had many “firsts” in relationships before me like living together, having pets, going through hard times. But I try to stay optimistic because he has never given me a reason not to trust him. His ex is not part of our lives.

I saw an aesthetic reel of a rainy coffee shop with romantic music playing, with text that said, “This and an angry love confession.” It tugged at my heart because I didn’t have a passionate moment like that. My husband and I’s relationship started with us being upfront about what we wanted in a partner and how we would pursue it. Discussions of compatibility, whether we wanted kids, and how we would handle finances were focal points of our first meetings. Yes, love grew and we had romance, but it wasn’t like this. I think this is the healthiest relationship I’ve been in.

I sent this reel to my husband, wanting to spark a friendly conversation about being young and in love, and how much I wished I had experienced that with him, even though our beginnings were a bit “boring.” I was also curious about his young-love experiences, so I asked him. I didn’t think I was being sneaky or trying to pry, nor was I trying to make myself unnecessarily insecure. I just wanted to find a moment where I could relate to him.

**EDIT: To be fair I was the one who asked him to open up and tell me more about his past and everything about his life I didn’t know. Like I wanted to have a glimpse into his emotional world as a young guy and was just honestly curious about how he used to be. So I don’t think I fault him for actually being honest** 

He answered that he had a moment exactly like what the reel described; that is exactly how it was with his ex, and it was one of the most enthralling and magical “young love” moments for him. He rode a bike with her in the rain for 30 minutes to her place, and I don’t want to describe what happened next but they became official at that time. He said he “feared falling in love”with her because of how much it could hurt if she left. He laughed to himself, recalling sneaking into her place while her parents were asleep. He said he was just a silly lover boy at 23, and obviously, having his affection returned by a girl he had a crush on for months was crazy but it was all in good fun.

I thanked him for telling me, but it made me reflect. I wished I had been the one he had that moment with. I wished I could have given him that amazing memory that people write books about and post reels about. This made me feel extremely insecure.

That night, I brought it up again and expressed how it made me feel awful, because I feel like what we have can never compete with what he had. He said very gently that I don’t need to compete with that, because despite that moment, he chose me. Those fiery moments are something one experiences when young, but he knows what he needs from a long-term relationship after that experience, and he found it with me.

But this doesn’t help, and for some reason, it makes me feel worse like someone choosing to eat healthy after the most indulgent meals of their life. I feel like she was his “great love story,” while I am just the wise, mature choice he needs for the rest of his life. All of this makes me so unreasonably angry with him for nothing that is his fault. Like I just wish he’d knew magically how it would make me feel. I feel like I want him to make it up to me.

Entry will be from the porch (yellow), which will also have seating and may eventually be partly enclosed.  The divider walls (purple) will be removed.

This will be a small coffeeshop.  I only want seating for 12-15 indoors, and a like amount on the porch.  Food will be limited, counter service.  It will sell books in addition to coffee.  There is a basement that can be incorporated later, I’m thinking if the bookstore expands.

I am looking for more as I've re-watched all of my favorites already and I feel like I have fairly specific taste. Please help me with recommendations!

The things I am looking for in dramas:

* A fun and original premise, even some fantasy like body switching, super powers, etc.
* Legal or criminal themes (not a must), a mystery
* Light-hearted romance, will they won't they kinda deal
* Humor/comedy
* Strong female character
* With all episodes already out please

What I would rather not have in the drama:

* Overall there can be sad moments but I don't like it when the whole drama is melancholic
* Too much action/violence
* Historical dramas
* Romance drama with zero other storyline
* Medical dramas atm
* High school storylines
* Slice of life type stuff (usually)
* Anti-hero main character

Here I have listed all the dramas I can remember watching, split by category, to give you an idea of what I like.

**Older favorites I've already rewatched:**

* I Can Hear Your Voice (probably one of my favorites ever! love the mystery and both leads)
* Coffee Prince (love the cute leads, romance and overall vibe)
* (used to like Secret Garden, Boys over Flowers, To the Beautiful You, Heartstrings, You're Beautiful but not really thinking of rewatching these)

I have watched more older dramas (around 2014 so anything before that) but have not kept an exhaustive list.

**My more current favorites are:**

* Strong Girl Do Bong Soon: this is a favorite for many reasons. I love the premise, the humor (except the gangsters), the cast (I love a cute female lead especially), the strong female character, the magical realism, the whimsy. Anything that feels similar would be interesting!
* See You in my 19th Life: I loved how original the story was, it really took me in. I love a cool premise and I found the main female character very interesting and the romance charming.
* Crash Landing on You: this is less my style because I don't love military related stories, and overall it was a bit stressful, but the romance and chemistry was so good and the premise was so unique that it won me over anyway. Really good secondary characters as well, especially all the North Korean characters.
* Reply 1988: once again less my style (I tend to find slice of life dramas less interesting, especially with school aged characters); but I was won over by the likeable cast of characters and the setting of 1980s South Korea.

Overall I love an original premise, fun/cute/whimsy vibe, interesting characters especially the female lead. I would love something along those lines.

**I've also really enjoyed:**

* Extraordinary Attorney Woo (cute/unique female lead, interesting premise)
* Cheese in the Trap (I enjoyed the webtoon when it was coming out)

**I've seen but wouldn't necessarily re-watch:**

* Just Between Lovers (interesting premise but didn't love the romance or the characters that much)
* Descendants of the Sun
* Because this is my first life (cute romance but not enough going on story wise)
* W between two worlds (cool story but almost a bit too much)

**I started but couldn't get into/didn't finish:**

* Weightlifting fairy Kim Bok-Joo (just cannot get into the main character, I don't love that actress)
* When Life gives you Tangerines (probably will watch it someday but a bit too stressful for me rn)
* Beyond the Bar (didn't like the main actress)
* The Girl who sees scents
* Good Doctor
* The School Nurse Files
* Little women (the plot was just too much, too weird)

Every semester starts with the same promise: “This time I’ll start early.” And yet, somehow, you end up chugging coffee at 2 a.m., surrounded by notes, praying for a miracle 😅  
Good news - you can break that cycle. No magic, just a few realistic habits.

**1. Break it down.**  
“Prepare for the exam” sounds huge. Split it into smaller parts - like 2–3 topics a day. Seeing progress keeps your motivation alive.

**2. Create a** ***realistic*** **plan.**  
Don’t schedule 12 hours of studying- you’re human, not AI. Three focused hours with real breaks will get you further than 10 hours of burnout.

**3. Try the Pomodoro method.**  
25 minutes of deep focus + 5 minutes break = magic. After four rounds, take a 20-minute break. You’ll be shocked how much you can do.

**4. Remove distractions.**  
Put your phone in another room or use the app *Forest* \- if you leave the app, your virtual tree dies 🌱. Brutal but effective.

**5. Sleep. Eat. Move.**  
Pulling all-nighters doesn’t make you productive - it just fries your brain. Rest is part of studying.

💬 The secret? Don’t wait for motivation. Start with 10 minutes. Momentum will come after that - not before.",2,1760907863.0,Ca1mChaos,0,1.0,False

Advice?,"I (24M) have historically not been very successful in dating for a variety of reasons. In high school and college, I went on some dates but never got a second date, and I didn’t start consistently having sex until this year. Also, the sex has mostly been with a couple FWBs that I’m not particularly interested in because of their age and looks (both late 30s). 

I have been on 4 dates this year, but each time got the same response in one flavor or another afterwards - they weren’t feeling it. Same or very similar as what I heard from girls early on. I went on a date last weekend with a 27 year old I asked out at a coffee shop that was amazing - it turned into a 5 and a half hour adventure of eating, dancing and talking, and I really liked her. 

But unfortunately, she rejected my kiss towards the end and I never heard from her after the date despite texting her a couple times. 

It’s possible it was because of my age as she initially thought I was older than her and some women I’ve polled said they would never date a guy younger than them, but given that I’ve heard from women so frequently that they “weren’t feeling it” and thought that I was “hard to read”, that would be my assumption in this case. 

I don’t think it’s my looks as I’ve invested heavily in them and I’ve been told I’m attractive, and I don’t think it’s my job or money as I work a good corporate job and am well-off for someone my age. I honestly think it comes down to energy and some intangible “it-factor”, as I’ve been told I’m a good conversationalist and easy to talk to. 

The problem is, that friendliness and comfort typically hasn’t been accompanied by attraction and romantic/sexual interest. 

And of course, energy, charisma and other intangibles are very hard to teach, but I would just really appreciate it if guys who struggled with turning comfort into attraction and sexual interest could share what worked for them.

Also, the lack of success I’ve had, especially in nightlife situations where I feel the bar for energy and confidence is higher, makes it harder for me to approach because I get stuck in my head about what to say and do. 

I’ve struggled with depression for a long time and am hoping that getting treatment will have downstream benefits for my dating life by making it easier to be loose and fun, but I guess if there are things I can do/say that would help, I would love to try them out and see if they work.",5,1760907816.0,AskMenAdvice,7,1.0,False

I'm Alex, a tech enthusiast who dove into content creation a few years back. I was always that kid tinkering with gadgets and my journey naturally led me to explore how tech and media intersect. This curiosity eventually inspired me to start HypeCaster. 

In the early days, I was experimenting with content creation, using whatever tools I could find and teaching myself along the way. This exploration opened my eyes to the insane amount of time creators spent on repetitive tasks, especially editing and posting. That's when the idea of using AI and automation hit me—it could really be a game-changer.

My first projects involved a lot of manual workflows. You wouldn't believe the small hacks and experiments that, quite frankly, sucked at first. I remember spending an entire weekend setting up a flow that broke after three runs, lol. But it was those late nights, fueled by sheer stubbornness and coffee, where I learned the most.

The real eureka moment was seeing creators constantly burning out, something AI could help with. So I dived into Make.com, connecting APIs, and began testing with a few brave early adopters. The first time our prototype actually generated a video, I knew we were onto something. The excitement of automation working its magic was beyond any buzz I'd felt before.

HypeCaster today uses AI and automation to help creators generate and distribute their content seamlessly. Thanks for reading about my journey! Can't wait to share more soon and hope you'll join me for the ride.",0,1760907798.0,UberEats_drivers,1,0.5,False

I'm not here to debate the definition of masculinity with anybody or pass any sort of value judgement on personality types or interests, I'm just trying to find gay men LIKE ME to be friends with.

Gay men with stereotypical gay interests can find friends and dates pretty much in any gay space or any gay app. It's all the same type of people at gay bars, drag shows, orgies, or any organization with LGBT in it. 

Guys like me, masculine presenting, that DON'T like gay bars or drag shows (again nothing against it, just not my cup of tea), don't take PrEP, and dont have casual sex with my friends... well it seems to be really challenging finding other guys like that.

I'm mid 30s, a professional actor with a few small tv credits, I audition regularly for usually bad guy roles, which is very fun for me. I'm into filmmaking, hiking, traveling, rock music, movies, eating cool food, and eventually I want to have kids & a family when I meet the right guy. 

I'd really like to meet other masculine, non-gay scene type guys that have common interests and also are planning to have kids one day for platonic friendship.

Every time I've ever made a post like this looking for friends LIKE ME, I get viciously attacked and gaslit by guys offended. I'm not here to offend anybody, nor am I saying anything offensive or homophobic.

I have never understood why being gay has to be associated with rainbows and drag queens and effeminate behavior. It's just not me, and I've come to realize, in most cases, the only thing I have in common with the vast majority of gay men I've met in my life... is that we both are attracted to men. Thats it. 

I'm not into social media, I don't even have any, I'm not into gossiping or talking shit about other people. I'm way too low key for that kind of behavior. I'm laser focused on my career goals and building a life where I can have a family. Would be really cool to meet likeminded guys. 

I'm based in Astoria. Hit me up if you're on the same wavelength and want to grab a coffee! cheers mates.

1ob10pr,https://i.redd.it/j8dfcprju4wf1.jpeg,The Divorce After the Happy Ending​​,"For my twenty-ninth birthday, my husband gave me a bottle of perfume.

I sprayed it on without a second thought and went into anaphylactic shock.

When I finally came to in the hospital, Liam was there, a bouquet in hand, with his childhood friend, Chloe, hovering by his side.

I calmly asked for a divorce.

Chloe immediately rushed to his defense, her voice choked with tears. ""Ava, please don't blame Liam! The perfume was my idea. I just thought the scent would be perfect for you.""

Liam wrapped an arm around her, comforting her, then turned to me with an impatient glare. ""You'll regret this.""

The next time I saw Liam was a month later.

After being discharged, I’d spent some time recovering at my old apartment before finally returning to our villa. The housekeeper informed me that Liam had only come back once, right after I was hospitalized, and hadn't been seen since.

I wasn't surprised.

This wasn't his only home. He had another one with Chloe.

I took a USB drive to the study and printed out the divorce papers. Two copies. I signed my name and then called him.

He arrived late that night, a gift bag dangling from his hand.

Seeing me on the sofa, he casually issued his usual command. ""Make me some soup. I was out with Mr. Harrison and the board. Drank too much. My stomach is killing me.""

He tossed the bag onto the couch and went upstairs to the master bedroom. He showered, changed into his pajamas, and then came back down.

He noticed I hadn't touched the bag and pushed it toward me.

""A replacement birthday gift.""

I didn't take it. He placed it on my lap. I stood up and set it aside.

""Aren't you going to see what it is?""

I tried to smile, but couldn't. I looked up at him. Our house was littered with identical gift bags. I already knew what was inside.

Ever since we'd had our son, he'd put zero thought into my gifts. Skincare sets, handbags, jewelry. The styles were always the same, the brands predictable. It was as if he spent less than three minutes picking them out.

He never seemed to notice that sometimes, his gifts would sit unopened for months.

Only that bottle of perfume had been different. The box was unique.

I’d opened it, sprayed it once, and regretted it instantly.

It was rose-scented.

And I am deathly allergic to roses. Even the scent is enough to trigger a reaction.

I picked up the divorce papers from the coffee table and handed them to him.

""My lawyer drafted these. Take a look. If there are no issues, just sign.""

He froze, his hand hovering over the papers. ""The soup… did you make it? I'll go check.""

I let him escape to the kitchen. He was back in a moment, his expression grim.

""You didn't make it.""

""I'm tired. I don't feel like it.""

His stomach must have genuinely been hurting. He pressed a hand to his abdomen and sat back down. I pretended not to see. He sidled up next to me, wrapping an arm around my waist, his voice suddenly soft. ""Ava, I was wrong. I've just been so busy, I asked Chloe to help me pick out your gift. How about this? I'll book a restaurant, and tomorrow, we can have a proper birthday celebration. Just the two of us.""

I looked at him and shook my head, gently removing his hand from my waist and scooting away.

His face hardened.

""Why? Is it really just because of the perfume?""

It wasn't just the perfume.

It was because the author had stopped writing.

The sweet romance novel was over.

His heart had wandered, and I had developed a mind of my own. We were no longer just characters, forced to be sweet for the sake of the plot.

The day after our wedding, my memories had returned.

I was the female lead in a cliché romance novel. Beautiful, smart, the campus ice queen with a fatal allergy to roses. Liam was the male lead: the cold, handsome CEO-in-training with a chronic stomachache who would do anything for me.

We had a sickeningly sweet college romance. After graduation, one night of passion led to an unexpected pregnancy. I had terrible morning sickness, and Liam, ever the doting partner, insisted I quit my job so he could take care of us. During the difficult months of my pregnancy, he'd scold my belly, telling our unborn son to stop tormenting me or he'd get a spanking when he came out.

It was shortly after my memories returned that Chloe came back from studying abroad.

She started working at Liam's family company, becoming his special assistant. That's when I learned that their families were old friends. After Chloe's parents died, Liam's family had taken her in. They were childhood sweethearts, and she had always been in love with him.

And I, the supposed love of his life, had never even heard her name.

A character who had never appeared in the sweet romance novel had suddenly materialized the moment it ended.

But I couldn't blame Chloe. She had confessed her feelings to Liam long ago. He knew how she felt, yet he kept her by his side. His motives were his own.

While I was pregnant, they traveled for business together, drank together, attended high school reunions together.

In the beginning, when I'd get jealous, he would just laugh it off.

Eventually, I stopped bringing it up. And Chloe silently wedged herself between us, where she remained to this day.

And now he was asking if this was all about a bottle of perfume.

A wave of pity washed over me.

""The perfume was just the final straw.""

""Liam, I've wanted to divorce you for a very long time.""

His brow furrowed, his eyes turning cold.

""Ava, are you seeing someone else?""

""I forbid it!""

Before I could call him insane, he lunged, pinning me to the sofa.

""Liam, no!""

I struggled, but he was too heavy. When his hand started to slip under my dress, I slapped him. Hard.

The sting of it stopped him.

His eyes were bloodshot, a cruel glint in them.

""Ava, don't forget you're still my wife. Am I not even allowed to touch you anymore?""

The memory of the D&C I’d had to undergo after the miscarriage flooded my mind, and my whole body began to tremble.

""You disgust me.""

Our eyes met. I didn't back down.

He finally pushed himself off me, slumping to the floor. A self-deprecating laugh escaped his lips. ""So that's it. No wonder you want a divorce.""

""Who is he?""

I said nothing. He grabbed his jacket from the sofa and stalked toward the door.

""Ava, you can dream on about a divorce!""

""You'd better hide him well. Because when I find out who he is, I'll kill him.""

As he reached the door, a sharp pain lanced through my chest.

I called out his name.

""Liam.""

He stopped but didn't turn around.

""Do you love me?"" I asked.

He was silent. I pressed on. ""If you loved me, would you keep a woman who's been in love with you for years by your side? If you loved me, would you let your mother take our son away from me, to another country?""

""Liam, the day you agreed to let her take our son, I started to doubt everything you've ever said about love.""

He finally turned, his eyes filled with confusion.

""I thought we agreed to let Mom take Ethan so we could have some time to ourselves.""

""You wanted that. I didn't.""

""He is the child I carried for ten months. I would never send him away for the sake of some 'alone time.' I'm not that kind of person.""

He shook his head slightly.

""But we said we'd have another baby.""

A bitter laugh escaped me.

""There is no other baby. I went into anaphylactic shock from the perfume. I miscarried.""

The expression on his face was beyond grim.

""Why didn't you tell me when I came to the hospital?"" he demanded.

""I was going to tell you on my birthday. But you never came. You sent Chloe with the perfume instead.""

""Liam, what good would it have done to tell you?""

He was silent for a long time. ""We can have another child,"" he said finally, his voice flat.

""No, we can't. Liam, let's just get a divorce.""

""If we don't, I don't know what I might do.""

I walked over to him with the papers. ""Sign them.""

He took them. ""And you, Ava? Do you still love me?""

""I've let go.""

""Recently? Or a long time ago?""

I didn't answer. He did. ""A long time ago. You stopped being clingy. When I went on business trips, you stopped telling me to be safe. When I drank, you stopped telling me to drink less. The longest I was away was that trip to Moscow. I waited ten days, and you never sent me a single message. Just like tonight, with my stomach. You couldn't care less.""

""Ava, you were the one who stopped loving me first.""

""I stopped being clingy because Chloe was always with you, leaving no space for me. I stopped asking about your trips because she would post pictures of the two of you together. I stopped telling you to drink less because you were always taking drinks for her. And that trip to Moscow? I didn't message you because I saw a video of the two of you dancing intimately in a club. I didn't want to interrupt.""

""As for tonight… you're right. I don't love you anymore.""

""Liam, I'm making way for Chloe. I wish you both the best.""

His knuckles were white as he gripped the papers. His eyes, red and furious, watched me as he tore the documents to shreds. Then, he stormed out.

I had the housekeeper clean up the mess and went back to the study. I printed ten more copies.

An hour later, I saw Chloe's latest social media post.

A selfie of her sitting on the edge of a bed, Liam asleep behind her. The caption read: ""The man I love has never learned to love himself. If you don't love him, why can't you just let him go? Why do you have to torture him?""

I took the ten copies of the divorce papers, got in my car, and drove to Chloe's house.",1,1760907660.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I have a fairly limited skincare routine right now and apart from sunscreen, I'm not very familiar with Korean brands. Same with the dermatologist, I have never had any procedures done so I didn't want to get anything too crazy done. 

For me the big hurdle was figuring out _what_ to buy for my skin and what procedures to get done. I read this sub for a few months and reached out to a few clinics and got an appointment for a skin analysis with one of the clinics that was mentioned positively, however, they were very clear that it would only be to recommend procedures at their clinic, they would not provide skincare product recommendations. I looked a fair amount and would have been willing to pay for this service but unfortunately didn't find anything. 

I finally ended up getting the free skincare analysis at the Seongsu Olive Young. It was a bit of a process and we ended up spending basically the whole day in Seongsu which really hadn't been on our list but man, we had a really good time there so no regrets at all! It was an unexpected highlight of my trip. 

The skincare analysis at Olive Young took about 20 minutes and they gave me a list of products to buy. The lady that helped me was super, she walked me through what to use when, how often, routines for the morning and night etc. I ended up buying multiples of everything so that I would have enough for at least 6 months. 

Tips for this: 

- get there early, the queue for the day was closed at 9.55am 
- ask them to be specific about what they recommend (not just brand name) because when you actually try to find the products, you'll find each brand name has a lot of variants for the same product. 
- Probably a personal opinion, but I'm not a huge fan of the sheet facemasks. They just don't fit my face. I wish I'd known that and just bought the liquids or powders that you can apply yourself that work for any face shape. 
- maybe read up a bit before you get this done so you're a bit more informed than me (the lovely olive young worker looked like she wanted to jump out of a window when I asked her what a toner was hahahaha) 

The skin analysis at the dermatologist was quite focused on procedures. I had a consult with the dermatologist where we went over my results and she gave me her recommendations. I was pretty clear with her that I've never had anything done before and that's why I had booked and paid for skin analysis and consult with her. I also had a budget for myself so I just picked two procedures that fit within my budget. I thought the doctor was fine to talk to but I really didn't enjoy the atmosphere at the clinic. Small things like they offered everyone in the waiting room coffee except me? Maybe once they realized my budget wasn't that high they weren't interested anymore but as a customer it feels a bit shit to be treated that way. 

Tips on this part:
- make sure you speak to the doctor that will be performing the procedure
- check whether VAT is included in the price you are getting quoted
- ask questions even if you feel like a PITA, I think the tech forgot to apply numbing gel to my forehead and looked a bit grumpy when I insisted on it and given how painful the procedure was, I'm glad we waited the extra time for that to kick in. 

Overall I'm pretty happy with my experiences and having a total blast with my new skincare routine. I'm sitting here typing this out on my phone with a one of the facemasks on that I need to do minor surgery on to get to fit my face but lesson learned for the future!

The next step is an IV of coffee straight through the veins). 

I was giving her the syringe of antibiotics and she was really resistant so only having like 1ml at a time. Each time I was making her chase it with the hot chocolate. 

When I’m finished giving her the antibiotics I go to get my coffee. Except it wasn’t coffee 😭 it was my daughters hot chocolate 😭😭😭

I made her chase her fkn antibiotics with a double shot long black 😭

She’s only 3.5 😂😭

**Middle aged, otherwise healthy and fit male here looking for your experiences and how close this sounds to CFS. My apologies for the essay**

**THE START**
5 months ago I began training for a vigorous, long-distance cycling race. I’ve done much harder before so this wasn’t unusual, other than being the first big workout in awhile. I’d had COVID before 2x, but wasn’t sick with anything at this time, and had successfully done similar difficult activities without issue since then. The day after, I started feeling really drowsy, and went out on a short hike where I was forced to turn around due to feeling woozy. Days later, I developed a sense of disorientation; like I’d had a couple of beers - this continues today.

I continued training, and would have symptoms following some trainings: anxiety, blurry vision, temperature regulation. I started getting significant POTS/tachy symptoms (these have mostly resolved, for now), especially in the heat of the day or a hot tub. One day I had my normal coffee and almost felt blacked out; I couldn’t remember what I was doing; putting condiments in the water bottle drawer etc. Started feeling very sensitive to caffeine.

**THINGS GET WORSE**
Then things got bad: I was able to do less and less each day, to the point of being housebound and, for short times, bedridden. Depression, anxiety, headache, short of breath, and feeling like my body was ramping up to fight the flu. I started becoming a bit sensitive to sound, and just generally feeling… startled and almost dizzy much of the time, especially mornings. Though my appetite is/was volatile, at one point it was HUGE and I was losing 1lb+/day for 2 weeks no matter what I did or ate, despite taking weight gainer and getting normal thyroid labs. The weight loss has resolved for now. 

At one point my neutrophils/lymphocytes were off and my hormones (cortisol, ACTH, testosterone) tested critically low, so my PCP had me do a pituitary brain MRI which found a 7mm lesion (Rathke’s Cleft Cyst) there, which I believed to be the cause of my problem for a good while. However, an endocrinologist said this is highly unlikely due to its size, location, and the fact that my hormones ultimately recovered.

**FIRST RECOVERY, AND RELAPSE**
A nurse who thought I was just “anxious” prescribed me Zoloft. I took it and within 2 hours the psychiatric AND physical symptoms seemed to improve dramatically, though both have come back intermittently. At the time though, I began a fairly sudden recovery to where I was able to travel again, lift again, and was walking 10+ miles a day (!!) and feeling good with zero symptoms, other than a persistent mild feeling of disorientation. But then I got a cold, and *after* a normal experience recovering from sore throat, runny nose and fatigue, I felt WIPED for 2+ weeks: the feeling of flu-like unwellness came back, this time with nausea, but no psychiatric symptoms. After it went away, I felt *physically* recovered but dealt with depression/anxiety for weeks after.

**MY QUESTION + COUNTERPOINTS**
I’ve tested negative for everything: lupus, Lyme, Hep A/B/C, HIV, EBV/mono, MS, Sjogrens, MCAS and other allergies, CMV, anemia, vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, lung clots, heart disease, Celiac, Wilson’s, thyroid diseases, etc. Cardiology, pulmonology, gastrointestinal all normal. At this point no explanation for random, onetime critical drop in hormones and neutrophils, but they’ve recovered and all other bloodwork is normal.

I seem to match most of the mandatory and optional diagnostic criteria except unrefreshing sleep: other than Zoloft-caused disruptions, my sleep has been normal and I don’t feel physically or mentally exhausted upon waking (perhaps because I’m still early days?). In a “flare” - historically brought on by overdoing it or illness - I feel a flu-like malaise and maybe nausea, headache, anxiety, depression. I still work, I still walk, and meds help at least a little with the physical symptoms. Other counterpoints to CFS: I have no myalgia pain at all, I feel flu-like unwellness rather than fatigue, no swollen lymph nodes, symptoms often largely resolve in the afternoons, symptoms are sometimes physical-only or mental-only or both, and I’m confused by my sudden ability to return to heavy-load walking/lifting days without consequence.

Is this similar to your experience? I’ll keep working with my docs (long covid clinic next month) but I’m wondering if this resonates with anyone.

1ob0lyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ob0lyf/is_my_grandmother_visiting_us_before_she_moves_on/,Is my grandmother visiting us before she moves on?,"Hi everyone. I’m a Christian (in case that helps explain my perspective), and my grandmother recently passed away. She was 61, almost 62. We weren’t super close—she wasn’t the best grandmother to me—but she adored my older brother. He didn’t want to see her in hospice, so he left early that day.

Right after she passed, the doors in her hospice room started opening and closing on their own. There was no draft or anyone walking by. The place was an old remodeled mansion, so I tried to brush it off as just one of those things.

But then strange stuff started happening to my family throughout the week.

My great-aunt said that when she came home from work, a photo album fell off her coffee table by itself and opened to a page with my grandmother’s picture.

Another aunt, who works from home, said a huge stack of papers suddenly fell off her desk with such a loud thud that she thought someone had broken in.

Now, here’s the part that really got my attention.
We’ve had a Google Home for years. It barely ever works—you basically have to yell right next to it, and even then it usually ignores you.

On the morning of my grandmother’s celebration of life, my dad was in another room, my mom and I were in the living room. The TV was off, no one was talking, and the dogs were quiet. Out of nowhere, the Google Home says,

>“Okay, now playing All I Want for Christmas Is You by Mariah Carey.”

We all froze. My dad thought it was me, but my phone was off. I thought it was him, but it wasn’t. The song played until I manually stopped it. None of us had touched it.

Then last night, my parents called me out of my room asking me to turn my speaker off. I was using earbuds, so it wasn’t me. The Google Home was blasting Spanish music this time—which is weird, because my grandma hated anything that wasn’t country. Just as I went to turn it off, it suddenly stopped on its own right after my dad said,

 “Okay, Mom, we get it. Stop it.”

One last thing: earlier this week, my mom’s dog suddenly started growling while we were sitting in the living room. She’s the sweetest dog and never growls like that. She wasn’t looking at any of us—just staring at the floor. We figured it was a bug, but there was nothing there. She kept growling until she whined and then laid back down.

All of this has me wondering… is my grandmother visiting us before she moves on? Or is there another explanation for everything that’s been happening?

years ago I used tinder and my first dates were pretty bad as I was still very anxious until I got my first gf from the app. We broke up and I had some on and off success with it. I got a few spicy dates before and a hookup before eventually finding my next gf that we had a long three year long relationship with. We ended on good terms. Now me 26m redownloaded the app and I was shocked how much attention I was getting compared to years ago. I think I had like a 100 matches which was completely new for me. I was excited but soon my excitement was over as I was constantly humiliated it’s quite pathetic honestly. 

The first girl I was interested in we were talking for hours every day before her inviting me to her apartment. However upon arriving there she almost instantly rejected me over sex saying she prefers more psychopathic guys and told me about an ex situationship with tattoos on their face that went crazy just before they had sex so they didn’t hookup as well(whatever any of that information meant) 

Second girl we had a fantastic date she was looking really happy we were kissing and there was a lot of touching and everything was great. Two days later she hits me with the “it won’t work out essay” on Instagram. 

Third girl was a catfish I politely talked to her for awhile but explained to her that it won’t work out and I wish her well. 

And now my last date today ditched me last moment a week ago before coming for a hookup so we rearranged to meet for a coffee today. We met up and  after 10 minutes she said she was uncomfortable and even frightened by my energy and I said it’s ok for her to leave. I asked her over text what all that was about she told me I looked really angry because she was late to the date and that made her uncomfortable(I didn’t express any anger except for a joke comment “are you always that early on your dates” at the beginning). I was a bit nervous(I usually become calmer after we get to know each other a bit). But honestly it was shocking she didn’t seem to have that good of an energy either but something about me genuinely scared her I don’t know why. I do have an intense stare but I don’t really try to frighten someone. 

And no I don’t have hygiene issues I shower I use expensive parfumes and I am tall. I guess if I get dates my face is alright but I seem to constantly turn off my dates for some reason? I feel quite depressed from my experiences like something is horribly wrong with me and I can’t tell what. I am pretty nervous before a date but I usually become talkative after a drink.

I went after him of course, but out of sheer curiosity, followed at a discrete distance to see when he'd notice I wasn't there. The answer was NEVER. He never looked back to check if I was there, not even once. 

2. Daycare - he cries at dropoffs but according to the educators, even though he'd calm down and start playing eventually, he would still be emotionally volatile all day.  He doesn't like other kids crowding him and the reports I get are that he's on/off all day long.

For me, caffeine/dairy and junk food (hot cheetos, candy, pizza, etc) would irritate my stomach more when preparing for an exam over a night of lost sleep. More common in my college days, but I think this really did the trick for introducing endometriosis symptoms like ibs. 

I emotional eat frequently and perhaps I should add more fiber to what I'm emotional eating because it's usually dairy and carbs. I think this is how I ended up slowing my metabolism. 

College and Metabolism Changes:

For the longest time, I did not understand what a fast metabolism was but college was like the nail in the coffin for me. I had a high metabolism most of my life and after one quarter of college, it was history. 

Poor sleep, stress, poor diet and mixing these absolutely gave me a hormonal imbalance, irregular periods, and inflammation that was never there before. 

In addition, a huge change during and after college was a loss of predictable eating schedules and balance.

I also, barely drank coffee before college. I can't tell how caffeine influences my endometriosis and metabolism.

1ob0elh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ob0elh,"Home built roaster, hello friends! Feedback welcome.","Hey fellow roasters!

I have a fluid bed roaster that I started building almost 10 years ago now and have continually improved on it over the years. Like many, it all started with a pop corn popper on my front porch! I have roasted lots of coffee, but I feel that I haven't quite nailed it yet. The roaster uses two heating elements (from a heat gun and a pop corn popper - stacked), solid state relays, a DC leaf blower, a hacked together roasting chamber, a pressurized box, and sheet metal chamber for the beans. I wrote some software on the raspberry pi that controls the heat and the air, shows live RoR, and saves each roast profile and temps, in case I want to play it back later. 

It's been a good hobby over the years, and I've dropped it and picked it back up many times. Recently, with the advent of LLM’s and coding agents, things have gotten really fun! 

My method right now is to start the blower at 50%, the heater at 90% and preheat for 1 min. Usually the inlet air is about 650, and the bean chamber is at \~400. Then I drop the beans in. Over the roast of about 8-10 min, I slowly decrease the heat while watching the bean mass temperature, and roast to a bit past the first crack. That’s it really! 

All of that aside, I haven't found many good resources for how to roast consistently well with a fluid bed roaster. And my setup isn't perfect, I know. I'm posting this largely because I feel like I've been alone in this hobby for a long time, and many of you are my people, so to speak. Instead of ruminating on this project alone, I’d love to garner some feedback and ideas from the community. Below are a few suggestions, but let’s pretend I know nothing :) 

If you’ve tried this before, where/how did you learn? What’s your method?

From a design standpoint, what are the biggest features of a home-built roaster to focus on? Which ones really move the needle in the journey to roasting great coffee?

I've been wondering about getting a Switch O3 to see if lighter coffees will taste better via pourover, while being able to also immersion brew my dark roasts. Does this make any sense or will the dark roasts taste very much different brewed this way?

Would I just grind and brew the dark roasts the same way in the Switch - brew a coarse grind for 4 minutes and then open the switch? One benefit will be faster cleanup than with the Espro.

The r/pourover is so much more active than r/frenchpress, I feel like I'm missing out on something! ",3,1760905976.0,pourover,2,0.72,False

1ob09nq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ob09nq/aita_for_not_texting_my_father_on_fathers_day/,AITA for not texting my father on Father’s Day?,"My (21 F) father (62 M) abandoned me when I was 14 without an explanation, he’s a business man so he traveled a lot for work and one day he just didn’t come back. Some time later my mom and I discovered that he was cheating on my mom with a girl much younger than him from another country and his entire family knew this whole time.
Anyways, time passed and I was the one that always tried to maintain the contact and relationship during the years, he could go months without writing and never asked more than the usual “how is school?”, basically a non present parent (he even blocked me once because I confronted him about not telling me about his new daughter).
At the start of the present year he came back to our country for the first time (7 years later) and I met up with him at a coffee shop to talk, I tried not to bother myself trying to ask questions cause I knew he wouldn’t answer any (he always changes the subject or just gets super angry and starts avoiding / yelling) but at the end of the day I wanted to ask him just one thing. It’s important to note that I’ve never asked ANYTHING from him, not money, not love, not nothing, so this was the first time I was going to ask for “something”.
I put the condition that from now on he needed to put the effort on having a bond with me, he had to at least talk to me twice a week via text or call. If he at any point stopped I wasn’t going to answer him anymore/worry about keeping up with him.
He agreed and swore that no matter what he’ll do it.
1 week later no call, no text.
Another week the same
And another…
A text finally came saying “hi honey why haven’t you texted me?” I just said that we had a deal, explained to him the conditions of the deal AGAIN and stopped answering.
The next day he sent voicemails laughing at me saying that “it wasn’t that serious”, to not make such a big deal out of nothing (reminder this is a 62 year old man with now 6 kids and 2 ex wifes) 
he tried texting once or twice after that and never again, never apologizing or trying to mend.
Fast forward Father’s Day passes and his birthday, I obviously don’t text him cause at this point the only thing that makes him my “dad” is our blood connection.
He comes to our country again and meets up with my mom for some stuff and starts YELLING to her about me not texting him, about how spoiled I am and how bad I’ve been taught manners… my mom is obviously furious and tells him that he’s the one that committed to something, didn't fulfill it and then didn’t have the decency to just apologize. He left saying that he was “a really good father” and that she needed to educate me to respect him.
I need to know external opinions cause idk I think he’s just really narcissistic and doesn’t accept that actions have consequences.",8,1760905869.0,AmItheAsshole,17,0.79,False
1ob09nn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ob09nn/aitah_for_being_the_final_snap_that_got_my/,AITAH for being the final snap that got my supervisors fired?,"For context I (17f), with mild autism might I add, have worked at a small coffee shop in my local town for about a year and a half. 

I have a pretty good relationships with all my of my colleagues, some of them include my sister and my mother for the most part, all apart from the two most hated supervisors who I really don’t have a good relationship with. The supervisor that got what was coming, we will call her jenny (25f) is the daughter of the other supervisor. Some say the genes definitely run in the family. 

Long story short they have been working at the cafe and within the company for the best part of 12 between the two of them. The managers and owners of the company clearly don’t like them but have had real probable cause to fire them. 
Until now. 

They have both always been ones to speak without thinking. Within the first month of working there the mother had a 45 minute argument with me that autism is just a myth and I was faking it for attention. (I will come back to this again later). 

Her daughter is not a spitting image of her mother by any means, but she sure does have the genes of her. There have been many occasions, in which I can’t even count on two hands, where I have been harassed and humiliated in front of customers and colleagues. In which I also have witnesses and have spoke to management and each time they have been given a slap on the wrist because they have worked there so long and are so loyal. It has gotten to a point where I go no contact with her during shifts when we are together to not trigger any violations and humiliation. However it is starting to show too my colleagues and the customers. Everyone has my back tho not theirs which I’m thankful for. 

My sister who is also a supervisor has also been subject to these violations and have too complained to management but nothing changes.

Same goes for my mother as-well. 

For the two supervisors it’s one rule for them one for another they can spend 45 minutes talking to people and it not count towards their PAID 30 minute break but then proceed to have their 30 minutes and in total have nearly triple break. They can spend 47 minutes cashing up (why so specific? Easy answer I timed them) and make sure they have no interaction with the cleaning process and leaving it all to the rest of us. But when we spend 5 minutes of OUR OWN BREAK talking to people they drag us inside and make us work. 

It’s so hypocritical. 

Going back to the mother. My entire management team is furious as she has made many comments on my eating habits and the way my mother raised me which she has no right to question or have any problem with bc if she did there is a never ending list of things that she does herself that are worse and probably are the reason her daughter is like the way she is today. 

My mother is more trust worthy than her and has worked for the company way longer than the supervisor so ofc the are going to take my mothers side as they know what she has been through to be able to raise me because I know damn well it was not the easiest job in the world to do. 

I have complained once again and finally this time they got what was coming to them. But what do I do they are still going to come back to the coffee shop it’s a small town with not many places to go. Should I file a report? Should I document everything they do? And this isn’t the first time I’ve gotten someone fired for their actions. 

Is this what I’m going to be known for the rest of my life there? ",0,1760905869.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False

Wada: Good morning everyone. 

Hayashi: Hey. 

Tamba: Morning Masa. There’s coffee if you want some. 

Wada: Ah, thanks! 

Tamba: Shigeki made it. I haven’t had any, so hopefully it’s okay. 

Yanagi: Wh-what’s that supposed to mean? 

Tamba: Hm?

Yanagi: Why did you say it like that? 

Tamba: I mean, I dunno. I don’t feel like I said anything weird. 

Yanagi: Saying it that way makes it sound like you expect the coffee to be terrible. 

Hayashi: Relax. You’re making a big deal out of nothing. 

Yanagi: R-right… Regardless, help yourself Masanari. 

Wada: Thanks. I’m sure it’ll be fine. 

Wada: I’m glad that almost everyone is here. 

Tamba: What do you mean?

Wada: Well, I mean…we’ve been through a lot recently. It’s just kinda nice to be with everyone. 

Tamba: Oh, yeah! We’re already struggling. Being lonely would just make things worse. 

Yanagi: I agree! I think it’s important that we stick together. 

Wada: Speaking of together, Nakamigawa and Ojima should be here soon, right?

Hayashi: I don’t see why they wouldn’t be.

Yanagi: Right. Nakamigawa just tends to…lag in the mornings. 

Tamba: What, does he have a really intense skincare routine or something? 

Yanagi: I…n-not that I know of. What made you think that’s what I was referring to? 

Tamba: I don’t know. Doesn’t that just seem like something he’d do every day?

Yanagi: I suppose so, but I wasn’t talking about that. 

Wada: Do we even get skincare products here?

Tamba: Oh, right. I guess I don’t really have any. Other than some moisturizer. 

Tamba: Anyway, I don’t want to think about Hiroaki right now. I’m already not looking forward to talking to him today. 

Hayashi: Just ignore him. He’s not worth it. 

Yanagi: I was going to say the same. 

Tamba: I-I know, I know! I just…ugh!

Hayashi: Well, if you’re gonna do this, get it out now. 

Wada: What about Tora?

Hayashi: Hm?

Wada: Has anyone seen him today? 

Hayashi: Can’t say I have. 

Yanagi: I haven’t either. 

Tamba: Yeah, same for me. He’s probably in his room though. 

Wada: Probably. He’s been really broken up since the last trial. 

Yanagi: Y-yes, he’s…been struggling. 

Tamba: Should someone try to get him maybe?

Hayashi: What do you mean?

Tamba: Well…if he’s that upset, it’s not gonna get any better if he just stays by himself, right?

Tamba: He could get even worse. 

Yanagi: …

Yanagi: W-we should send someone. 

Tamba: Who though?

Yanagi: Masanari, you’re probably the closest to him here. 

Wada: Yeah, I guess so. It’s just that…I don’t think it’ll work. 

Yanagi: Oh?

Wada: He’s really, really upset. I don’t think getting him to come out right now is as easy as just saying the right thing. 

Yanagi: Ah…that’s probably true. 

Tamba: Yeah. Hmm…what about you Mai? Any ideas?

Hayashi: Actually, yeah. I’ll handle it. 

Tamba: You…huh?

Hayashi: I’ll handle it. 

Yanagi: M-Mai, are you sure?

Hayashi: Calm down. He’s not gonna do anything. 

Yanagi: Well, no, but-

Hayashi: I’ll be back. 

(Hayashi walks out)

Wada: What’s she gonna do?

Yanagi: I have a feeling we’ll find out shortly. 

(Scene transitions to conversation between Hayashi and Monjiyama.)

Hayashi: Tora! 

Hayashi: If you’re not up, get up. Open the door.

Hayashi: I know you can hear me. Open the door!

Hayashi: Don’t make this harder than it has to be. Open the damn door. 

Hayashi: Fine. You’re not giving me much choice. If you don’t open the door, I’m going to break it down. And you know what happens if I do that. 

Hayashi: Five…four…three…two-

(Monjiyama opens his door.)

Hayashi: Morning. Come on, let’s go.

(Hayashi picks Monjiyama up.)

Monjiyama: Ah…!

Hayashi: Don’t be difficult here Tora.

Monjiyama: Mai, what is this!? Let me go!

Hayashi: Nope. You’re coming to breakfast. 

Monjiyama: This is ridiculous…you know I’m alive now.

Hayashi: Not good enough. We’re going. 

Monjiyama: Ngh…!

Hayashi: You’re a little stronger than you look. Only a little though. You might as well stop struggling. 

Monjiyama: …

(Hayashi walks back into the dining hall and puts Monjiyama down.)

Hayashi: There. Now stay. 

Monjiyama: …

Wada: H-hey Tora!

Yanagi: Good morning!

Monjiyama: …Hey. 

Tamba: There’s coffee if you want some. And you should probably get something to eat. 

Monjiyama: …

Monjiyama: Alright…

Yanagi: Mai…

Hayashi: What is it?

Yanagi: Was that really necessary? 

Hayashi: Could you think of another way to get him out? 

Yanagi: Well, no, but I feel like that was-

Hayashi: You said yourself that we need to stick together.

1ob03ta,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ob03ta,Caffe Panna Tripla,"Headed into the city and walked a couple miles to build an appetite for my first impression of Caffe Panna's Manhattan location. Caffe Panna is a scoop shop with daily rotating flavors in both pint and scoop forms, with other offerings.

I went at 2:00 even though there was a line around the corner, it was still only a 10-minute wait. However, the guy tried to give me someone else's order so they're a little scrambled back there. 

Today the rotation of flavors were aligned with my palette so I was determined to visit after months of having it saved.  For pint, there was Min Thint, a double mint girl scout cookies and cream with Oreo brittle. For scoops, the Espresso con Scorza, Nutella Crunch, and Rainbow Cookie flavors. I decided on the triple threat and if hunger allows, ill go for the thmintpint. Toppings such as whipped cream, fudge drizzle, and Oreo crumbles are complementary, so obviously I loaded up.

The structure of the triple scoop is one bottom layer with two flavors balancing on top, then the toppings. This matters due to melting flow, and especially the flavor pairings. You can't reach the bottom flavor until you clear a significant chunk of the top layers.

So, in my Tripla, the Espresso Scorza and Nutella crunch were on top of the rainbow cookie. The flavor cohesion that revealed itself across the cup showed that this was suboptimal. The ECS clashed with the NC, and would have meshed better next to rainbow cookie, both are fruity flavors.

As far as the ice cream goes: excellent. Not too cold, not too soft, heavy with the cream. It is definitely a creamy full fat dense smothering ice cream, surpassed in full fat flavor by the whipped cream the give on top. Great texture, not too sugary, signified by how not that sticky my hands were from dripping. ""Perfect"" to ""plenty"" ratios of mixins, they're they're but not overwhelming. The Nutella crunch was packed with buncha crunch bars that crisped and cooled with copious chocolate. The Espresso Scorza had these tiny candied lemon bits that splashed acidity in random bites. The rainbow cookie when I got to it started out with bottom of the bag crumb sizes, but by the end and melted the bigger chunks with chocolate coating showed up.

The Nutella Crunch Bar was the first bite and it was a blast of nostalgia. I don't think I need to explain how a runch bar tastes and feels and if I do, then that's your problem and you're missing out. Occasionally you'll get some crunches of hazelnut, and the flavor ties together as this alternating Crunch bar Ferrero Rocher choco wombo combo.

Moving to the Espresso con Scorza, the coffee flavor comes through a good amount, coffee flecks imitating vanilla beans, but the issue with this flavor is that sweet lemon does not go with it. Coffee Brewers and roasters try to avoid acidity and sourness so strange choice to combine it with lemon. However, the candied lemon peels are sweet and tangy so I do see the vision in quality at least. 

For me, the Rainbow Cookie unfortunately had everything going against it. Small starting pieces, 90% of them were pink, it reminded me of fruity pebbles instantly, it was half melted when I started and fully melted when I cleared the top layers, not enough chocolate covered pieces. But it was satisfying overall.

I guess the move is to knock at the triplock, just get the double scoop and then if you have room in your stomach get another scoop. 

The Tripla filled me up so I decided to save getting a pint for another day. I also decided I needed to burn it off as it was coming in, so it gave a nice tank of fuel for the walk back to wtc. It is a very dense and heavy ice cream, it fills and satisfies your stomach. Most people I saw ordering were getting one  flavor one scoop.

Epilogue: the ice cream messed with my internal map calibration, so I walked down an adjacent street. To my pleasant surprise, a Van Leeuwen storefront faded into view after a few blocks. Felt like the good old days discovering things instead of pinning on Google maps.",25,1760905488.0,icecream,2,0.94,False

Rain pattered on the roof of Andy’s car, a thousand tiny drumbeats that washed together into a dull roar. Periodically, his view of the building across the street was blurred by the cascading waves that slid down the driver’s side window. The rain made the street lonelier than normal, the activity sparse and more noticeable. On a doorstep a block away, a delivery driver handed someone their food then jogged back to his car, the wing of his jacket pulled over his head in a futile attempt to stay dry. A child jumped off the curb and splashed feet first into a large puddle, giggling gleefully while her mother watched from the window. A rather large, collarless dog trotted down the sidewalk alone, stopped to sniff at a pile of leaves, then disappeared around a corner.

Andy’s gaze returned to the parallel building, his grip on the wheel tightening. His hands twisted in opposite directions as he strangled the thing, back and forth, back and forth, until he felt a stinging heat on the skin of his palms. Then he released, the color rushing back into his fingers and his hands coming away with bits of black material that had rubbed off from the friction. He slapped his hands against his jeans and then snatched his phone from the tray beneath the dashboard, yanking the white cord out of the bottom socket. The bright pop music playing throughout the cabin immediately stopped, draping the car in a blanket of silence save for the constant pounding of the rain overhead. 

He slid his thumb upwards, the lock screen giving way to the thread of his messages with Steph – or rather his messages *from* Steph. A line of gray boxes ran upward along the left side of the screen, disappearing behind the header at the top. Andy would have had to scroll back three days to see them all, a string of disparate pieces of text that resembled a schizophrenic raving when bundled together. The messages had started mild: simple questions that Steph had expected Andy to answer eventually. He was her boyfriend. Why wouldn’t he?

The mood changed to confusion after a day, when the idea that Andy was simply busy and hadn’t yet seen his phone grew more implausible by the moment. By the end of the second day, the tone had changed from confusion to betrayal, which then gave way to a low, simmering anger. Yesterday, anger had finally been replaced by rage. Insults hurled and accusations made: Andy didn’t love her, he’d never loved her, he was immature, he was a coward. The manic string of messages finally ended last night with Andy’s own block of lime green that halted it in its tracks. The text she’d likely already known was coming:

*I think we should talk. Can I come over tomorrow morning? 10? Shouldn’t take long.*

The following block of gray came immediately. The little bubbled ellipses and the text *Steph is typing…* flashed across the screen with the speed of a camera shutter.

*Okay.* With a period. Not *K*. Or even *OK*. 

*Okay*. Full spelling and punctuation. Four extra buttons to push, a deliberate effort to communicate a deliberate mood. In stark juxtaposition to her previous rantings and ravings, this was the first text that left Andy genuinely unsettled. *Okay*.

Andy stared down at the screen now, his thumbs hovering over the keyboard while the cursor blinked softly in the blank space that awaited his message. He chewed his bottom lip, looked back up at the building, then back down again. *Drive away*, a voice called to him from within. *Send the text and drive away. Turn your phone off. Hell, block the number. Just be* done *with it. Don’t you want to be done?* Andy’s thumbs thundered against the keyboard in response, hitting each letter more through instinct than deliberate action. As he did, images flashed through his head, images he’d done his best to tamp down deep these past few days.

A pink shirt he’d sworn was blue. A slice in his finger that dripped blood into dirty dishwater. A figure standing above his bed silhouetted in shadow, stock-still, gaze boring a hole right through him. A girl with raven hair stalking in and out of sparse lamplight. Andy’s index finger suddenly hurt more than it had moments before, the back of his phone pressing against the old bandage. When he was finished typing, Andy surveyed his finished text, his heart pattering in his chest.

*I’m breaking up with you*. 

His thumb hovered over the vertical arrow to the right, trembling, begging him for permission to drop to the screen and be done with it. But as he sat there contemplating, a final image flashed through his mind, blowing the others away into wisps of smoke. A dark bedroom. A spinning fan that turned his chest cold. Huffing breaths, intermixed in the air.

“I love you,” Andy said. And there was Steph’s face too, her bangs cascading off her head, the single tear running over the bridge of her nose from a bright green eye. 

“I love you too.”

Andy’s thumb came down onto the screen, not once but again and again and again. Then, he held it down, watching the sentence disappear with a snap. He typed a new message and sent it off before he had time to second-guess himself. 

*I’m here. Coming to the door. Can you let me up?* Once again, the reply came back almost instantaneously.

*Sure.*

Andy yanked the handle of the car door, pulling his hood up and jogging across the street. His foot connected with an unseen puddle right before the sidewalk, soaking the sock and sneaker on his right foot all the way through. He grimaced, slowing to a walk as he took the side alley around to the back of the building, to the door that led up to the second floor apartments. He rounded the corner, planning to step under the awning in front of the building’s back door… and almost ran right into a large green dumpster sitting against the brick wall. 

Andy stood there, stupefied, slack-jawed, the rain soaking through the top of his jacket and turning his shoulders ice-cold. He scanned the back alley, his grip tightening around the phone in his hand. On the wall of the building sat two dumpsters, one for recycling and one for garbage. Next to the dumpsters, at the very end, was a wall of gray gas meters stacked two rows high. The remainder of the little concrete alcove was sparsely populated. A few lined spots for maintenance vehicle parking. A wraparound chain-link fence backed by a thicket of dark green bushes. An overturned bicycle with a smashed wheel, all rusted to hell. 

But there was no door. No entrance to the second floor, as Steph had always said there was.

Andy’s face grew hot, his cheeks flushed, as he remembered the countless times he’d dropped her off “at home” over the past three months. The peck on the cheek, the wave goodbye, the scamper up the steps to the building, winding around the back to disappear around the corner to… to do what?

A soft rustling cut through the sound of the rain, drawing Andy’s gaze to the back of the alley. He inched closer and closer to the fence and the green darkness beyond, searching for the source of the sound. As he did, his eyes zeroed in on a specific spot on the fence, a place where the chain was broken along a pole near the back corner. The bottom edge had a slight curl to it, like it had been pulled back over and over again. Beyond the hole, a solid wall of thickets. Hard to crawl through, but not impossible. 

Andy squatted to inspect the hole in the fence, but as he did, the rustle sounded out again, louder this time, accented by the slight shiver of the greenery beyond. A louder rustle. A harder shake of the bushes. The crack of a twig. Something was moving straight toward Andy from within the greenery, and it was moving fast. Andy froze, his breath caught in his throat, as the shaking grew more pronounced, the rustling louder and louder and louder until… 

Thunder erupted in the sky at the same moment that two cats rocketed out of the bushes, shooting through the gap between Andy’s feet as he stood up straight. Andy whirled to see them dance around the back alley, the first cat now cornered by the second that had followed it out of the bushes. The first cat coiled and then lunged for the gap at the back of the dumpsters, shimmying around and then breaking for the front of the building. Andy watched the two of them scamper away, the second cat closing in on the first before they both disappeared around the corner. He didn’t know if they’d been playing, preparing to mate, or locked in a bloodthirsty battle to the death.

Andy’s entire body shuddered as the phone in his right hand vibrated, reminding him that it was there. He was getting a call, and didn’t need to look at the contact card to know who was on the other end. His heart pounding, still looking at the hole in the back fence, he raised his phone to his ear, clutching it tightly with fingers grown stiff and cold from the rain. He clicked the side button, and the call sprang to life. There was silence on the other end, but accompanied by the dull static and buzz that indicated someone was there all the same. Waiting for him to speak. Terror stuck in Andy’s throat like he was choking, but he managed to croak out a single word. 

“Steph?”

The voice on the other end was familiar, but it wasn’t Steph’s. In fact, it wasn’t a woman at all.

“Who the hell is Steph?”

Andy shook his head and blinked long, stepping to the side of the building and pulling his phone away from his ear. He stared down at the name on the screen for a few seconds, his mouth opening and closing in shock. No, it wasn’t Steph on the other end. It was Mike Green. Andy put the phone back, trying desperately to course-correct and grab hold of the conversation.

“Mike, I… I didn’t… how did you um…” Andy closed his eyes and sighed, then started over. “Hey man. What’s up?”

“Nothing much, nothing much… mostly just calling to see how things are going.” There was a beat on the other end that lasted long enough for Andy to realize he was the one who was supposed to speak now. Mike took the initiative anyway. “So… how are things going?”

“They’re good, they’re um… yeah, man. They’re good.” Andy rubbed at his right eye with the heel of his palm until he saw stars. Another beat, too long for comfort. *Shit*. “And, uh…what about you? Things good?”

“As good as they can be, I guess.” Andy could practically hear the shrug on the other end.

Another silence settled between the two of them while Andy felt a slow panic rise in his chest. The air between them was palpable, heavy with an awkwardness that he couldn’t quite understand. It felt like there was a piece missing in the conversation, a vacuum in the information he should know. This was one of his best friends in the world. Why did he suddenly feel so… weird?

“Look, Mike, I’m kind of busy right now, so if there’s something you need…”

Mike simply chuckled on the other end, and Andy felt his forehead grow hot, the anxiety boiling over into the rest of his body. “*What*?” he asked, sharpening the edge of the word.

“Look man, Carly’s the one who told me to be the bigger person, so this is me trying to be the bigger person. If I did something to piss you off, then I really am sorry. But I don’t think that gives you the right to just ghost me without an explanation. You… I *deserve* more than that.”

“Mike, I… really have no idea what you’re talking about.”

Another chuckle on the other end, matched with a rustling sound, like he was standing up. “Alright bud. Whatever you say. You have a good one, alright?”

“Wait, *wait*,” Andy stammered, trying desperately to keep Mike on the line. “Just… hold on.” He took a breath. “Your birthday. We… *I’m* coming to your birthday. Tonight.”

The pause on the other end was so long that Andy thought the call had dropped.

“Mike?”

“Andy, is everything… okay?”

“Of course everything’s okay,” Andy replied, a lump forming in his throat at the lie. He could barely feel his toes anymore, his rain-soaked sock wrapped around his foot. “Everything’s fine.”

“My birthday was last month. I texted you. Invited you. You didn’t reply.”

“No, I must’ve,” Andy replied, shaking his head defiantly. “I told Steph. We were planning to go.”

“I don’t know who that is.”

“Steph. My girlfriend, Steph. C’mon man, I know you’ve met at least once or twice by now. You must’ve.”

“Andy, I don’t know how I’m supposed to make this clearer to you. *I haven’t seen you in three months.* I text. I call. I invite you over. You don’t. Fucking. *Answer*. Hell, I haven’t seen you since that night at M–”

“At Mickey’s,” Andy interrupted, throwing Mike on speaker while he navigated to his photos. “She was there that night. Steph. You were sitting next to each other. Like she knew you, or something.”

“That was a while back…” Mike replied. “What’s her last name? Maybe Carly knew her if she was hanging around that close.”

“It’s… uh… it’s…” Andy muttered, still thumbing through his photos, looking for the right one to send to Mike to jog his memory. He stopped for a second, his brow furrowing as his mind tried to dredge up the information. *Her last name. You know this, Andy. What’s her last name?* “I don’t… I’m not sure.”

“You’re not *sure*?” Mike asked, exasperated. 

“Just hold on, I almost have a picture. I’ll send it to you.” Andy finally landed on the photo he was trying to find, but as he did, he felt a pang of fear in his chest. The phone shook slightly from the shivers of his hands. 

On the screen was the selfie that he and Steph took the preceding weekend on his apartment balcony. Both smiling up at the camera, hair tussled, coffee in hand. Happy. But Andy’s gaze hadn’t fixated on any of those details. Instead, he stared at Steph’s shirt. It read *Highland Park 5K Run and Walk*. And it was blue, a distinct shade of periwinkle. Impossible to forget.

Then, as if on cue, Andy’s phone buzzed, a banner dropping down to show the preview of a text. It was from Steph.

“Mike, I’ve got to go.”

“Andy, I swear to god, don’t you dare–” 

*Click.*

As Andy read the text from Steph – or the person who called herself Steph – he felt a deep sense of despair settle over his mind. A feeling of finality, defeat. Inescape. The singular comfort of it all was that of the numerous things he seemingly didn’t know about his own girlfriend, he at least knew where he could find her.

*Babe, you’re right. We should talk. I’m at your place. Come home when you’re ready. I’ll be here waiting. I love you.*

\---------------------------------------------

The elevator chimed brightly as Andy stepped out into the hallway, the wet rubber of his shoes squeaking against the tile. The corridor felt more foreboding than usual as he studied it, but he couldn’t tell how much his temperament played a role in that. The lights seemed dimmer and flickered at irregular intervals. The paint on the walls near the baseboard was chipping. The constant *drip drip drip* of the rainwater falling from the sleeve of his jacket onto the tile floor woke Andy up, bringing him back to the present. He clenched his jaw, tight enough that he thought his teeth would surely splinter, inhaled sharply, then strode toward his door at the end of the hall.

As his heavy footsteps echoed through the corridor, a voice screamed in his head, repeating a single line over and over: *Call the cops! Call. The. COPS!* He’d considered it as he drove back to his apartment in silence, his knuckles turning white against the steering wheel. He’d almost done it on the elevator ride up. But the image of himself cowering out in the hallway as a group of burly policemen kicked his door in and hauled out his 120-pound beanpole of a girlfriend was too much for him to bear. He wasn’t going to be emasculated any more than he already had been. This was *his* house. *His* life. *His* girlfriend. And he wanted her out *now*.

Andy stopped in front of the apartment, finding the door slightly ajar, a trail of water similar to his own leading up to it and then disappearing underneath. As soon as his eyes landed on the door, his nostrils filled with a familiar smell, one that brought back the same feelings of elation and fear he’d come to associate with it. An earthy, vanilla scent, which wafted out of the crack in the door, seeping into his pores, up into his septum to curl around the base of his brain. His confidence bloomed as he grabbed hold of the door handle, a thin smile even flickering over his lips. He’d never needed the police. What could Steph possibly do to hurt him in his own home?

Andy opened the door to find his apartment painted a soft gray-blue from the rainclouds outside. Lightning flashed in the windows, accompanied by a roll of thunder, illuminating the trail of water that continued from the outer hallway across the vinyl floor of the apartment. The scent he’d detected was stronger now, making him feel lightheaded and warm as he shut the door and followed the trail past the kitchen, then the dining area, then the living room. Down the hallway, to turn left at his bedroom. Stopping in front of the closed bedroom door, each heartbeat was a thunderclap in his ears. Andy stood stock-still, listening for any sound at all on the other side, but only found pure silence. One last deep breath. Then, he wrenched the door open.

Andy stepped gently into the room to find it much as he’d left it earlier that morning, save for a few items on the top of the comforter that hadn’t been there when he’d made the bed. He approached to inspect the items, and found that they were pieces of clothing. One sock, then the other. Black shorts. A periwinkle shirt. Underwear. All laid out for him to find.

The door slammed behind Andy, causing him to whirl back toward a corner draped in shadow. Steph stood in the darkest part of his room, only her hand sprouting from the pocket of gloom to press against the cheap wood of the door. The only other visible parts of her were her eyes, which glowed unnaturally bright and green, angled in just the right way to denote that she was smiling underneath all that shadow. The smell in the room was suffocating now, intermixed with something more foul. Rotting flesh. Decomposing fruit. Somewhere in the room a fly buzzed, cutting through the *drip drip drip* that emanated not only from Andy but from Steph now too.

Another flash of lightning illuminated the room, displaying Steph’s full form for just a second – naked, smiling, her black bangs hanging over eyes that shimmered, accented by pupils of a quality more reptilian than human. Andy sucked in a ragged inhale as he backed away instinctively, his knees colliding with the mattress to bring him down to a sitting position. He felt tears bud in his eyes, replacing the bravado he’d worn with such confidence moments before. It smelled rank and bitter in the room now, all traces of the former sweetness having dissipated into thin air. 

Steph sauntered forward, taking her time to savor each step. One bare leg stepped out of shadow, then the next. As she moved toward Andy – frozen in fear, breath shuddering in his chest while he gripped handfuls of his comforter – she spoke, the words spilling out of her mouth like honey.

“Andy…” Steph purred, the dim lamplight from the streets below catching her naked body that almost *slithered* across the room, waving back and forth in an unnatural gait. She stopped right in front of him, looking down at him without bending her head.

“Andy,” she murmured again. “*Andyandyandy*.” She reached up and cupped his chin in her right hand, her taloned thumb and index finger pressing into each cheek. His mind screamed at him to run, to yell, to do *something*, but the signal couldn’t quite make it to his muscles, which had been cemented together where he sat. Steph continued, inspecting the features of his face with unnatural eyes that flickered up and down, back and forth.

“You know, babe, I was about to leave that night. Pack it all in.” A ghost of a smile wafted across her face. “And then… there you were. The answer to my prayers. The thing I always needed, but could never find unless I stopped looking. *The One*. 

And you were just so… so… *lonely*. So *desperate*, Andy. I could *smell* it on you. It was exquisite. Delicious. And I knew from the moment I laid eyes on you that you were special.”

“Steph…” Andy stammered, as the creature leaned in and inhaled deeply.

“I can smell it on you now, too. Fear. Desperation. A slightly different kind, but they all smell the same, all taste the same in the end.” She dropped Andy’s chin and took a few steps back. “I really do want you to know, Andy. You were my favorite. So head-over-heels. So in *love* with me. After all this time, it’s pretty easy to sort out the people who want you from the people who *need* you. 

But I never had to doubt when it came to you. And despite what comes next, I need you to know that I really did… really *do* love you. That’s what truly makes you special Andy. Because this is the first time that I’ve ever felt bad about what I’m going to do.”

Steph raised her hands to the back of her neck, almost as if to unfasten a necklace. Then she dug her fingernails into the skin and *pulled*, the scoliosis scar that was never a scoliosis scar unbuttoning itself as her flesh squelched and ripped and tore. Her skin fell away as she pulled and pulled, tumbling to the ground in sheets as the rotting smell in the room reached its crescendo. And out of the pile of flesh that had gathered on the floor stepped a thing so horrid that Andy could only focus on a piece of it at a time, lest he go mad completely.

Black, matted fur. Glistening green eyes, rows and rows and *rows* of them, too many to count. Limbs and appendages splaying and spreading out, unfurling like a flower in full bloom, twisted at angles that should have been impossible. Jowls that dripped with saliva, thick and silvery and glittering. Then the front row of eyes flickered, and the thing was on him in a flash.

Only then did Andy remember to scream, but it was too late, his cries of terror drowning out into a dull gurgle as blood filled his lungs and burst out of his mouth, spattering his face while fangs sank into the soft flesh of his throat. 

For a second, it was excruciating. Then, he felt nothing at all. 

\---------------------------------------------

**EPILOGUE**

SIX MONTHS LATER	

“This had better be good,” Kieth muttered, rolling up his sleeves as he hit the bottom of the basement stairwell. The foul smell of rotting refuse smacked him in the face hard enough that he coughed and then spat on the floor, fighting off nausea. “Because I hate coming down here.”

“Just down this hallway,” Jason, Kieth’s assistant foreman, answered, leading the way with a high-powered flashlight. Jason was a man of few words, which Kieth appreciated in a second-in-command, but the big man had been quieter than usual when he’d grabbed Kieth from his trailer office out in the courtyard. He was clearly bothered by something.

All in all, the old cannery renovation project had gone off without a hitch these past few months. Kieth’s firm had been brought in as the initial strike force, gutting the entirety of the factory/warehouse campus before moving onto the second phase: transforming it into a state-of-the-art shopping center. Another squeaky clean building for all the squeaky clean yuppies who’d moved in droves to this neighborhood over the past decade. 

Certainly not a place Kieth could have afforded to live when he was younger, nor any of the men and women on his crew. Looking out the window of his trailer office every day, Kieth wondered if the rent on the apartment building two lots over was discounted just for having to look at this eyesore, or if these people would pay just about anything to be this close to a Whole Foods and a nice matcha latte.

The hardest part of the clean-up project was by and large the basement levels, the hallways of which wound deep into the structure like a maze. The homeless had been driven out of this place en-mass by the city before Kieth’s crew had been brought on, but that hadn’t made the place any cleaner. It seemed that every day, his men found some new disgusting little alcove down here, most of which never needed his immediate attention. This time was apparently different.

Jason and Kieth approached a group of young men who had huddled around a particular section of wall, some making small talk, but most milling about silently. The group parted when they noticed Kieth, opening the path to a small entryway in the wall big enough for a grown man to squeeze through. Jason started talking before Kieth had the chance to ask a question, using his flashlight as a pointer. 

“Sammy bumped into this section when he was sweeping up after the morning crew,” Jason said, his light sweeping over the opening. “Heard a crack when he hit it. Turns out someone had closed this section off with a board, painted it the same color as the wall. Made it look convincing. Who knows if we’d have found it if Sammy hadn’t hit it by accident.”

“So it was… what?” Kieth asked with a shrug. “Some bum’s makeshift house?”

Jason took a beat, his face unchanged, then said, “Something like that. Here.” He handed Kieth the flashlight. “Just… take a look for yourself.”

Kieth grabbed the flashlight, something twisting in the pit of his stomach as he scanned the blank, perturbed faces of the men circled around him. He turned toward the entryway, leading with the light as he crouched low and squeezed through. Jason and the kid, Sammy, followed behind him, while the others peered inside from the safety of the hallway. 

Any single piece of the room would have been mystifying to Kieth, but taken together, they caused a slow terror to build in his chest as he swept the flashlight across the space. A mountain of trash, old bits of cloth and plastic and paper, arranged into a large bowl shape, like a bird’s nest. A pile of used cell phones, the back opened and the battery removed from each. Animal bones, bleach white and picked clean, scattered in a thick layer around the nest. Some looked big enough to be from a dog, and Kieth felt the nausea return. But none of the oddities of the room could compare to what Kieth found in the back corner, approaching across bones that cracked and snapped under his boots.

“What are they?” Jason asked as Kieth squatted to inspect the cluster of six objects. They almost seemed like bowls, half-spheres about the size of a man’s torso with jagged edges sprouting from the rim. Orange, but slightly translucent. Pooled around the inside of each bowl and on the floor around the cluster was a sticky, viscous residue that Kieth didn’t dare touch. He didn’t want to believe it, but his brain told him there was only one logical answer to Jason’s question, as impossible as it seemed. Kieth was about to speak, but Sammy beat him to it.

“They’re eggs,” the kid murmured, his voice shaking.

“Not only that,” Kieth added after a dry gulp. “They’ve hatched.”

1ob02jv,https://www.reddit.com/r/litrpg/comments/1ob02jv/having_an_internal_comparison_of_stray_cat_strut/,Having an internal comparison of Stray Cat Strut and Azarinth Healer.,"I've had one cup too many of coffee, and having internal ~~debates~~ rants regarding several series, one being these two stories...I'm sorry. But here it is!

I think these series have some key similarities

\- Both feature a masculine female lead (who is bisexual: cause that is definitely going to be pointed out) **Edit: Correction, Cat is gay.**

\- both MCs have no specific goal in their stories, but rather incorporate themselves into different missions, plots and quests.

\- both have adopted/found families.

What differentiates themselves so much and one of the reasons why I enjoy one series so much more than the other is because of the involvement and agency the characters have in their respective stories.

Azarinth Healer:

\- The MC involves herself into large and dynamic quests, as if she's an overpowered DLC character that's jumping into everyone else's main storyline, making the damn near impossible missions possible. The bonus is that all these large, seemingly disjointed, missions are actually connected to the overall major plot of the story.

\- The side characters continue to have agency and contribute in some tangible way. While not all of them continue to grow in power like the MC (or at least as quickly), characters in book 1 and 2 continue to help the MC and try to achieve their own goals all the way to the end.

\- While not on a major quest, 80% of the MCs time is off somewhere training like there's no tomorrow and 20% of the time hanging out with friends and family.

Stray Cat Strut: (I've only read the first 6 books)

\- The MC is reluctantly forced to into every mission. Missions that are overall low to medium level side quests while the ""main heroes"" are off handling the larger problems. The missions are thrilling, and refreshing considering what's happening in each book (will get to that shortly), the impact doesn't feel rewarding because not much really changes in the story. Outside the additional resources the MC uses to splurge on herself and family, everything is the same.

\- The side characters, at their best, are great additions that add drama, action, and world-building for a few chapters. Unfortunately, most of them feels like they are just there to break up a lot of the monotony that builds up during the Slice-of-life moments.

\- Remember how I talk about the MC in Azarinth Healer trains like there's no tomorrow? In Stray Cat Strut, I think it's actually emphasized that there is a no tomorrow, but the amount of slice-of-life going in the series, is actually daunting. What makes it irritating is that book 1 was excellent (drama, action, suspense, comedy, it had it all), but the recent books...I would almost call fillers.

As I'm now drinking an iced coffee (wife doesn't know I had 2 extra cups), I'm lowkey tripping out how much these stories are the same, yet so, so different. Thank you for reading my completely healthy rant...~~debate with myself~~.",2,1760905404.0,litrpg,4,0.63,False

1oazzp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1oazzp8/not_invited_to_her_party/,Not invited to her party?,"So I have a friend I made earlier in the year, and we are not besties by any means. I would say we are like base-level friends and it mostly revolves around us getting our kids together for play dates or checking out a coffee shop. It hasn’t been a deep friendship but regardless from the moment I met her she would mention how she loves to host parties and get all the ladies together, how she does holiday parties and wants to invite me so I can meet her other friends and new people, and even once asked my idea on what theme to do this year for her holiday party.

October comes and she hasn’t mentioned it so I assumed she wasn’t doing one this year. 
Then 
A couple days ago we were actively texting to make plans and I asked about this weekend and she said oh I’m sorry I have plans let’s move it to the weekdays! Which was fine, but then I went online and saw her plans was actually the party she told me about all year.

Now I’m not feeling super left out because we weren’t close, but I do feel weird that she brought it up multiple times - only to not invite me in the end. 

She seems to have no issue with our friendship as she asked if I want to go out this week and actively sends memes. But it just made me uncomfortable because she had done this prior where she mentioned an event she had, but didn’t invite me because she assumed my husband wouldn’t not stay home and watch my kids (idk where she got this from) and wanted the ladies only. 

Anyway it just makes me not really want to see her again and idk if that’s an overreaction. ",0,1760905218.0,FriendshipAdvice,6,0.5,False
1oazznx,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultingph/comments/1oazznx/i_just_realized_that_i_no_longer_have_friends_and/,I just realized that I no longer have friends and it makes me sad,"
I (F24) used to have a lot of friends since I am an outgoing and extroverted person. Aside from college friends, I had friends from different orgs, communities, and in general, just hang out with different kinds of people. 

At first it was hard to keep in touch with people since daming ganap sa buhay, mainly work. I still tried to meet with them here and there pero recently I realized na wala na akong friends. Wala na akong ""main circle"". Everyone else is living their own lives na with their own circles.

Sa work ofc I interact and befriend them pero di yung same level of friendship like my real friends. 

In my POV, di ko rin talaga naalagaan friend groups ko. In the past YEAR, I hardly met with them and talked to them outside of the usual holiday and birthday greetings. Marami nga di ko na nagigreet talaga. Di rin ako mapagreply, once in a blue moon lang. Kaya siguro wala na akong friends. Jowa ko na lang best friend ko HAHA

I want to meet new people pero atp in my life, i dont know how. I want friends to go coffee shopping with, run, or just read books and share interestes. I feel so sad :(",14,1760905215.0,adultingph,4,0.9,False

1oazxuf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oazxuf,Alcohol alternatives for cleaning coffee & Strange fungal inside my ally,"Hi everyone,

I spilled some coffee on my Rog Ally yesterday afternoon. Luckily, it was powered down, and I immediately removed the battery and let it dry for 24 hours. However, I read online that it's best to open it up and clean it right away, as coffee and sugar can corrode the internal components.

I've just opened it up and found a lot of sticky spots that I plan to clean. What alternatives are there to using 99% alcohol? I don’t have any at the moment and can’t get it for another 2-3 days.

Also, what is this strange fungal growth? Surely that can't be from the coffee. Did it develop that quickly? I've only owned this device for about two months.

Thank you all in advance!",6,1760905100.0,ROGAlly,15,0.88,False

1oaztsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oaztsv/ex_gf_reached_out_after_nc/,Ex GF reached out after NC,"Just wanted to drop this in here to give a bit of ‘hope’ for anyone struggling in NC that wants to work it out w their ex.

For context my (26M) 18month relationship with my ex (25F) was generally pretty great but towards the end I got complacent and didn’t really put the effort / give her the attention she need and she ended it. It was very friendly on her end and still lots of feelings ect but it just ‘wasn’t right for her anymore’. 

After we broke up I went NC for around 2.5 months and last week she reached out about meeting up to give me some of my stuff back from our flat (previously she was very clear she didn’t want to see me in person for at least 6 months). Long story short we chatted for a bit, it was very friendly and just nice tbh, a bit like the breakup never happened (although we haven’t talked about it and i definitely won’t for a bit) and are meeting next weekend for coffee.

Still a long way from getting back together but it’s definitely a step in the right direction but just wanted to reassure anybody who’s currently struggling that it does happen but obviously timelines will be different :)",3,1760904834.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

1oazsz8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oazsz8,The Aiden batch brew extraction is incredibly even,"So I've had a lot of coffee makers over the last decade - a Melitta Clarity, a Bonavita 1800, Bonavita 1900TS, Oxo 9 cup, Oxo 8 cup, a Technivorm Moccamaster KBGT and finally for the last 10 months an Aiden. 

BY FAR the Aiden is the most even extraction of the coffee bed (Oxo 9 cup is a close second).  

For reference in the pics this is 60G of coffee, a Bunn 12 cup filter, ground with a Kingrinder K6 at 82 clicks. 

So if the Aiden is the best at even extraction, which is the worst?   

The Oxo 8-cup is awful - easily the most uneven brewer I've ever used - unless you manually stirred the coffee while it was brewing you would have entire sections of grinds that got no water at all.   I have no idea how this brewer has gotten the accolades it has, because it frankly sucks.  

The TVM also requires a little bit of stirring, which isn't too difficult given the lid design.  

The Bonavita flat bottom was ok, but very ""lumpy"" looking for lack of a better term when the brewing was done.  I usually stirred it. 

I directly compared the coffee from the TVM and the Oxo 9 cup, as well as the TVM and the Aiden.   The Oxo and the TVM were pretty comparable in output.  Overall for ease of use, carafe design, and having a timer, the Oxo is the winner between the two.  For being able to clean the water reservoir it gets a 2/10.  It gets musty and is basically impossible to properly clean.  I kept the TVM as I had wanted one for years. 

But then I got the Aiden, and the brew output from it blows the TVM away - it is much, much better, and it does both batch and single cup equally well.  For what is in the cup it is unequivocally better than the Technivorm.   Longevity wise?  Well I am on my second Aiden due to the failed flowmeter.  But Fellow Customer support was  easy to deal with.  

In short - if Fellow can get this resolved in a V2, it would be unstoppable in being the best on the market for the price.  A light in the base of the water reservoir would also be nice so it's easier to see how much water is in it.

Starting with the photo-bait, haha. This beautiful creature is a pregnant stray who lives in the alley my hostel is in, & devours food like I’m rich.

This sweet baby girl could use some snack money cause I’ve run out of money for her food (I’m not the only one to feed her, but I do still try to help out as much as I can) and I could really use a morale-boost of my own, a pick me up after a crap couple weeks. Anything from an iced coffee to (I didn’t see mentioning adult products banned in the rules so apologise in advance if not allowed, but some cigs or a vape.

Somewhat longer  version:
I live in hostels  out of two (now one) bag, a backpack and a messenger bag. I was switching places. I put the backpack one down for a second to smoke a cig, check directions. By the time I looked up it was gone (yes I still have my passport, & phone, thankfully. No wallet, cards, or clothes, really, general shit, come cash, etc. call me a dumbass. It was a stupid tourist mistake, probably the biggest mistake I’ve made in all my time traveling, which is saying something, lmao. Like I didn’t steal my bag but k can’t call myself blameless here cause I knew better than to put my bag down and smoke/look at my phone. 

Thanks  to the help of some friends and
Others, I’ve got my main shit covered, housing, some groceries, you know, the life/death crap. 

Her majesty & I will appreciate anything. As a fair warming she’s sometimes snobby and will only eat the slightly bougier more expensive packs of wet food, other times if it’s food of any sort she can’t get enough 🙄😂, & I’d really appreciate some coffee.

My name is Justin. I am a NYC native. I have an array of interests! I'm learning guitar, read a lot, love baseball, and exploring new places. I work in-office virtually every day, so I won't be home much during weekdays. May occasionally have friends/family over but would likely just stay in my room or go out. I don't have any pets but love them (well, most). LGBTQ+ friendly! If you think we'd be a good match, let me know. Down to grab a coffee or FaceTime. ",2,1760904735.0,NYCapartments,0,1.0,False
