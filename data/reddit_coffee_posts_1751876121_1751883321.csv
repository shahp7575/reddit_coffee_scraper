1ltqer6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlasticObesity/comments/1ltqer6/a_low_food_contact_plastic_diet_lfcp_protocol/,A Low Food Contact Plastic Diet (LFCP) - Protocol,"Practical rules for avoiding contamination. I will run this protocol as a 1 month n=1  experiment from today on. 


1. Buy whole, un-processed fruits, vegetables, nuts (in their kernels), seeds (in their husks), grains & pulses (dry not canned). Avoid items pre packed in plastic unless they can be washed (rice /beans) or peeled / de-husked / skin on (fruit/nuts). No fatty or acidic edible item directly touching plastic bags (eg cashews & other de skinned nuts, pine nuts, oil processed dried fruit, etc). 

> Do all processing at home if you can (eg. Take whole coconut, turn it into coconut cream, milk & flakes, as opposed to buying those separatelly). Avoid plastics in processing - No plastic utensils, plastic coated pans / non stick trays, no instapots / rice cookers / air friers, no cling film.

> Avoid waxed fruit / veg where possible by choosing peelable fruit / veg. Where not possible to peel, keep in hot water. 

> Make your own fermented vegetables & vegetable sauces. There is a good chance fermented products in the shops were fermented in plastic containers.

> Flour - mill your own (high power nutribullet / vitamix with grinding blades do a good enough milling job) & use for all baking needs. Most flours in shops have either added enzymes / improvers or fortificants. Avoid instant yeast for the same reason (added enzymes / improvers). All shop baked goods to be avoided.


2. Buy fresh meat & fish, whole or in large pieces & use it to make your own saussages, burgers, fish cakes, cured meats (gammon / unsmoked bacon, etc.), cooking fats  & stock. Avoid any processed meat & fish which you cannot produce yourself from fresh. 


3. Diary products - this is a food category where my thinking is not yet settled & which I am still looking to do more testing of products. For now - stick to a maximum of .5l whole milk / day or its equivalent in butter (15g) cream (30ml double cream) or *traditionally made cheese* (max 50g hard cheese, up to 75-100g for soft cheese). When eating cheese, remove the outer rinds where possible. Make your own yoghurt / feemented milk. 


4. Avoid / reduce high risk items (i.e those impossible to process at home), especially fatty and acidic substances):  

> Cooking oils (olive / sunflower). Limit - 1tbs per day. Use home rendered animal fat instead.

> Max 1tsp spices or baking aids (yeast, baking powder, etc.). Grind own spices from whole if possible. Avoid cocoa, as highly contaminated. 

> Condiments -  Soy sauce / miso paste / tomato paste / vinegar - under 1tbsp /day

> Sugar - up to 50g / day, granulated preferred. 


5. Drinks - due to the production process, it is likely plastic was used in fermentation & enzymes in clarifying the products / improving taste. So most would have to be reduced to a minimum (unless you make your own) - beer, wine, spirits, fizzy drinks, fruit juice / smoothies. 

> Coffee - stick to whole beans, ground at home and metal caffetieres / traditional espresso machines. Avoid black coffee sitting in hot dispensers at work, plastic coffee machines / coffee capsules or plastic coffee filters. 

> Tea - plastic tea bags, acidic fresh tea leaves processed using plastic - avoid.

1ltqdfe,https://i.redd.it/mdyubkmvefbf1.png,"$ATYR – What’s On This Week: Options Expiry Approaches, “Lab Conditions” Continue, and the Three-Month Countdown","Hi folks,

Welcome to another Monday, and for those in the US, I hope you had a relaxing Independence Day on Friday—even if it meant a quiet session for everyone else with the markets closed. For the rest of us, it’s the first full trading week of July, and I have to say, the calendar could hardly be quieter. There’s a real sense of lull out there: no major scheduled news, a holiday-shortened week last week, and the market continuing to take a breather after what’s felt like months of nearly continuous action.

It’s also worth noting, as a bit of a milestone for anyone following $ATYR, that we are now within the three-month window for the expected Phase 3 readout of efzofitimod. For those tracking the calendar, the market’s focus will only intensify from here, and each week feels incrementally more important as we approach that pivotal moment.

I want to start with a genuine thank you to everyone who reached out over the past week—DMs, comments, emails, and Buy Me a Coffee notes. I’m still catching up on a few outstanding messages, so if you haven’t had a reply yet, you’ll hear from me soon. It’s been especially encouraging to see a steady flow of deep-dive research requests from the community. As a reminder, I’m continuing to offer bespoke research and analysis for anyone looking to build a sharper thesis on their own micro- or small-cap biotech name (not investment advice, just deep research). If you’re interested, feel free to DM me here or email me at \[biobingo.research@gmail.com\](mailto:biobingo.research@gmail.com)—happy to do a cursory look free of charge, just to let you know what’s possible before diving in.

I also want to acknowledge the support that comes through Buy Me a Coffee—it really does help out. It takes a lot of effort, often at some rather odd hours here in Australia, to keep these updates coming. If you’d like to support my work—which not only helps me deliver more content in the future but also contributes to closing that information symmetry gap—you can do so through \[Buy Me a Coffee here\](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/biobingo). Every bit makes a genuine difference and helps keep these deep dives coming. Based on community feedback, I’ll also have a PayPal solution live in the next couple of weeks for those who prefer that.

On a personal note, I’m still playing a bit of catch-up from last week. Between the holiday, a handful of research projects in the works, and working through the next set of training materials, it’s been busy behind the scenes. If you’re waiting on something specific from me—analysis, a post, or just a reply—it’s on the way.

Let’s get into it.

\---

\## 1. Market Calendar and Trading Context

If there’s one defining feature of this week’s setup, it’s the near-total absence of scheduled news or market-moving catalysts. With US markets closed last Friday for Independence Day, even the usual Friday flow was missing, and we’re rolling into the week with little on the official calendar. There are no upcoming earnings releases, no company presentations or conferences, and nothing expected in terms of regulatory updates or trial milestones in the immediate window.

\*\*One notable exception:\*\* the next short interest report is due later this week. For a name like $ATYR, where float dynamics and positioning have been at the centre of recent moves, this bi-weekly data drop will be a closely watched moment. After the Russell rebalance and recent volatility, I’ll be watching to see if there was any meaningful short covering, fresh positioning, or signs that the underlying structure of the float is shifting. Even in a quiet week, this reporting date gives market participants at least one anchor for potential price action, and it’s often a catalyst for a short burst of volume or sentiment shift—especially if the numbers come in well above or below expectations.

This kind of environment has a few important implications for how the tape trades. First, you often see volume and volatility shrink as market participants step back, waiting for a headline or an event to act as a catalyst. Price action tends to narrow into tighter ranges, and liquidity can become patchy, with the order book thinning out, especially in the afternoons. For $ATYR, this means that even small trades can sometimes move the price more than you’d expect, and you’re likely to see a few “air pockets” where the bid or offer dries up for a spell before reappearing.

Just as importantly, we’re now in a textbook post-rebalance digestion phase. The recent Russell 3000 flows were a significant event, driving massive volume and repositioning across the float. Now, with that structural buying and selling behind us, the share register has effectively “reset.” In my view, this week is where the new normal starts to settle in—the market tests who’s still willing to buy, who’s comfortable holding, and whether there’s enough dry powder to lift the price if any real demand appears. It’s a stretch where the tape gets cleaner, technicals become more meaningful, and genuine accumulation or distribution stands out more easily in the absence of noise.

In summary, the low-noise “lab conditions” continue this week for $ATYR. As I've suggested before, these are often the stretches where market structure becomes most transparent and any true shift in conviction—up or down—shows up early. For traders and long-term holders alike, it’s a window to observe, recalibrate, and prepare for the next leg, rather than chase headlines that aren’t there. 

\---

\## 2. Retail Sentiment & Social Pulse

Retail sentiment remains robust this week, even with the broader news calendar on pause. If you check out the \[Google Trends data for NASDAQ:ATYR (last 12 months)\](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11c6qrzw6m&hl=en), you’ll see a clear story:

\- \*\*Search interest spiked sharply\*\* in early June, coinciding with the SSC-ILD readout and Jefferies conference—peaking at levels well above anything seen in the past year.

\- While those levels have since cooled off, the current baseline is still substantially higher than at any point before the lead-up to those events.

\- \*\*We’re not at all-time highs, but we’re nowhere near “back to sleep” territory either.\*\* Retail attention is holding well above 2024 averages, and the broader engagement trend is still up and to the right.

From a “community pulse” perspective, here’s what I’m picking up across the main channels:

\- \*\*Reddit, X (Twitter), and DMs:\*\* The conversation has settled into a steadier rhythm. Volume is down from the pre-catalyst frenzy, but there’s no shortage of new posts, questions, or threads circulating analysis.

\- \*\*Sentiment is overwhelmingly constructive:\*\* I’d estimate about three-quarters of commentary is rehashing known facts, often with a conviction-bullish or cautiously optimistic tone. Direct, strongly negative takes are rare right now.

\- \*\*Analysis quality is mixed:\*\* There’s a core group of contributors posting thoughtful, sometimes deep-dive style threads—even if some are still light on hard data. Around that, you see a larger crowd echoing headlines or amplifying bullish talking points, but the overall quality of dialogue remains above average for a retail biotech stock.

A few “on the ground” signals that stand out:

\- I continue to get a steady flow of DMs and emails from new faces asking about the science, platform, or market mechanics—many of whom are clearly doing their homework.

\- Social traffic and follower growth on the main $ATYR channels are still ticking up, even as broader small-cap biotech engagement has cooled.

\- There’s genuine curiosity and energy in the threads: people want to understand, not just chase a quick trade.

\*\*Bottom line:\*\*  

The retail engine is still running, and this ongoing engagement sets a strong foundation for whenever the next news or data drop arrives. In my view, this is a healthy kind of “holding pattern”—not euphoric, but engaged, curious, and constructive.

\---

\## 3. Options & Short Interest Mechanics

Short interest data will be reported later this week, which always provides a helpful read on the latest positioning. Given that short sale volumes and borrow rates are a persistent focus for many in the community, here’s where things stand as we start the week:

\- \*\*Short Borrow Rates:\*\* After a brief spike around month-end, borrow rates have settled back down to around 0.53% (annualized). This is on the low end for a biotech with a small float and high retail activity, and suggests there’s still plenty of supply available for shorts to borrow shares, at least for now.

\- \*\*Short Volume Ratios:\*\* The most recent reported short volume ratio (FINRA, off-exchange) for July 3 was 65.87%. The ratio has ranged from roughly 40%–75% over the past two weeks—indicative of heavy two-way flow, with shorts and longs both active. In my opinion, this remains a significant backdrop for near-term trading, and any sharp moves in the borrow rate or short volume ratio would be worth monitoring.

\- \*\*Options Chain:\*\* The next key expiry is July 18. Looking at the current state of play:

  \- There is concentrated open interest at the $5 and $6 strikes (both calls and puts), with notable build-up further out at the $7.50 and $10 strikes for later expiries.

  \- Implied volatility remains elevated, especially in the out-of-the-money options, which is typical heading into a period with no major catalysts but plenty of retail attention.

  \- As always, volume on the front-month options tends to pick up as expiry nears.

It’s also worth noting that the next options expiry—July 18—is now just over a week away. The way I read it, as expiry approaches, there is often a noticeable increase in both options volume and overall price movement as market participants adjust or close out their positions. For a stock like ATYR, which has seen concentrated open interest at a few key strikes, this can sometimes lead to short-term fluctuations or a temporary pull toward certain strike prices. I’ll be watching to see if there’s any evidence of this effect as we head into next week.

\- \*\*Fails-to-Deliver:\*\* The latest available fails-to-deliver data (through June) does not currently suggest a structural problem or ongoing squeeze, though the numbers have been volatile at times—something to keep half an eye on given the broader backdrop.

Overall, the combination of a steady borrow rate, high short volume ratios, and concentrated open interest sets up a relatively balanced but watchful environment. In my view, the absence of major news and the proximity of options expiry could mean more tactical positioning and potentially some volatility as expiry draws closer.

\---

\## 4. Charts & Technicals

A quick scan across the daily, weekly, hourly, and 15-minute charts paints a picture of relative calm after the post-SSC-ILD and index rebalance surge.

\- \*\*Daily and Weekly:\*\* Price remains in a tight range above $5, consolidating gains from the June breakout. There’s no obvious breakdown or surge—the tape is flat and liquidity has thinned a bit, which fits with the current lull in news and US holiday closure.

\- \*\*Moving Averages:\*\* On the daily, the 20, 50, and 200-day moving averages have all been rising, with the 20-day SMA acting as a soft support around $5.20. On the weekly, the trend still looks up, but momentum has moderated.

\- \*\*Volume:\*\* After a burst of activity into late June, volume has steadily declined. That’s typical in the absence of news or market-wide catalysts.

\- \*\*Intraday (Hourly/15 Min):\*\* Price action is range-bound, churning sideways in a narrow band—reflecting indecision and a lack of directional conviction among both buyers and sellers.

The way I see it, this kind of sideways action is exactly what you’d expect ahead of a major event window, with options expiry on July 18 and short interest data due soon. I wouldn’t be surprised to see volatility spike as we approach those dates, but for now, the charts simply confirm the underlying “lab conditions” thesis—calm, controlled, and waiting for a trigger.

\---

\## 5. Content & Community Pipeline

On the research front, I want to give a quick update for anyone interested in custom deep-dive threads. I continue to work away in the background on a number of these bespoke research pieces, and I have to say, it’s been incredibly interesting to dig into the range of opportunities people in this community are tracking. The motivations people share for getting into a given stock are all over the map—some are purely technical setups, some are thesis-driven, and some are personal or even just gut feel. That variety is part of what makes these projects so rewarding, and I’ve learned a lot from seeing how others frame their decisions.

If you’re curious about this or know someone who would benefit from a tailored research deep dive, just DM me here or email me at \[biobingo.research@gmail.com\](mailto:biobingo.research@gmail.com). I’m always happy to do an initial cursory scan for free, so you can see what’s possible before committing to a full write-up. Again, this is about sharing research and analysis, not providing investment advice.

On the training side, I’m a bit behind—life and work have kept me busy—but I’m still planning to drop a preview of at least one structured module this week. There’s plenty in the pipeline and, as always, I’d welcome suggestions on what you want to see covered.

Last but not least, keep the feedback, corrections, and requests coming. The more engagement and challenge we get in the comments or DMs, the stronger this community becomes.

\---

\## 6. Summary / Takeaways

All things considered, this week is shaping up as a true “lab conditions” period—calm, sideways, and with little in the way of major catalysts, but subtle shifts to monitor for those paying close attention. We’re now within three months of the expected Phase 3 readout in September, so every week from here on carries a bit more weight in terms of positioning, sentiment checks, and thesis maintenance.

This is the stretch where patient, process-driven investors tend to do their best work—not by chasing every tick, but by preparing for the main event and not getting distracted by noise. For now, I’m watching:

\- The next short interest report later this week,

\- Options flow and positioning as the July 18 expiry approaches,

\- Any unexpected headlines or inflection points.

Given the backdrop, it’s worth taking a minute to ask: does anything in the current data or market action really change your thesis on ATYR? For my part, I’m not seeing any information flow right now that would justify a meaningful re-think. Most of what we’re seeing is market mechanics—volatility around expiry, digestion after the index rebalance, and the usual ebb and flow of retail sentiment.

So as we continue the march toward readout, I’d suggest this is the week to check your process: Are the swings and tape action reflective of something fundamental, or is it just positioning ahead of a major binary? These are exactly the weeks where staying grounded and reflective pays off, especially when the temptation is to over-interpret every move. For me, it’s a behavioural checkpoint—a time to reaffirm process and be clear on what would \*actually\* change my view, rather than reacting to routine market noise.

1ltqay1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1ltqay1/how_to_make_cold_coffee_with_a_keurig/,How to make cold coffee with a Keurig?,"As a coffee lover, I've always enjoyed a good cold brew, especially during hot summer days. But let's face it, not all of us have the patience to wait 12-24 hours for traditional cold brew. That's why I started experimenting with my Keurig to make cold coffee, and I've got to say, it's been a game-changer.

First things first, you'll need a Keurig machine and your favorite K-cups. I personally like dark roasts for cold coffee, but feel free to use whatever you prefer. You'll also need a large glass filled with ice and any add-ins you like (milk, cream, sugar, etc.).

Here's the process I follow:

1. Fill your glass with ice, leaving some room at the top for the coffee.

2. Place the glass under the Keurig's dispenser.

3. Insert your chosen K-cup into the machine.

4. Select the smallest cup size setting on your Keurig. This ensures a stronger brew that won't get too watered down by the ice.

5. Start the brewing process and let the hot coffee drip directly onto the ice.

6. Once it's done brewing, give it a good stir to make sure all the ice has melted and the coffee is evenly cooled.

7. Add your favorite mix-ins and enjoy!

This method works great for a quick iced coffee fix, but if you're looking for something even more convenient, you might want to check out some dedicated iced coffee makers. I recently discovered a great selection at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They've got some really cool options that make the whole process even easier.

Now, you might be wondering, ""Is this really as good as traditional cold brew?"" Well, it's different. The Keurig method gives you a more immediate gratification, but it can sometimes lack the smooth, less acidic taste of a long-steeped cold brew. However, there are ways to improve your Keurig cold coffee:

1. Use bold or extra bold K-cups for a stronger flavor.
2. Try adding a pinch of salt to your grounds before brewing. It sounds weird, but it can help reduce bitterness.
3. Experiment with flavored K-cups for variety.
4. Make coffee ice cubes to use instead of regular ice. This way, your coffee won't get watered down as the ice melts.

If you find yourself making iced coffee often, investing in a dedicated iced coffee maker might be worth it. They're designed specifically for this purpose and can produce a smoother, more consistent result. You can find a great selection at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers if you're interested in upgrading your iced coffee game.

Remember, the key to great iced coffee is experimentation. Play around with different K-cups, ratios of coffee to ice, and add-ins until you find your perfect combination. Happy brewing!",1,1751882714.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False
1ltq9nz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpecialtyCoffeeSD/comments/1ltq9nz/san_diego_coffee_sharing/,San Diego Coffee Sharing,"I want to share my love for coffee with other people around San Diego! Having lived here for almost 3 years, I have really yet to find a community that I can share my coffee with locally. I love ordering coffee and trying new roasters around the world, but whenever I order from abroad I usually have to order in bulk in order to reduce the cost of shipping. With that problem I tend to have a major backlog of coffee in my freezer that I struggle to finish. I want to offload some coffee and share some knowledge with people in the area. I'm hoping to do popups for cupping and coffee tasting in the near future! If you are interested in trying some of the coffee I have in my inventory please let me know and I can let you know what I have. 

I'm not sure how I will do this with this coffee sharing but this is kind of a rough idea:

\- All my coffee are vacuum sealed and frozen with dates on when they were sealed and frozen. I was was thinking of sealing coffee in quantities of 15-100g or based on your needs.

\- Another thing to do is a weekly/monthly or just a sample pack of different roasters. With that being said that will depend on the amount of interest

\*\*I will be basically selling all the coffee at essentially the same price I got it for with the addition of possible cost of material so it will be still extremely affordable\*\* ",1,1751882591.0,SpecialtyCoffeeSD,0,1.0,False

While daily brushing and flossing are essential, they cannot remove all plaque and tartar buildup especially in areas that are difficult to reach.

Here are key reasons why biannual cleanings are recommended:

1. **Prevention of Gum Disease** Tartar buildup can lead to gingivitis and, if left untreated, progress to periodontitis an advanced form of gum disease that can cause tooth and bone loss.
2. **Early Detection of Problems** Routine dental visits allow for early identification of issues such as cavities, enamel erosion, fractured teeth, or even signs of oral cancer often before symptoms become noticeable.
3. **Protection of General Health** Oral health is closely linked to systemic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory infections. Regular cleanings help reduce harmful bacteria that may affect overall health.
4. **Improved Aesthetics** Professional cleanings remove surface stains caused by coffee, tea, wine, or smoking, resulting in a cleaner and brighter appearance.

Consistent six-month visits help ensure that minor issues are addressed before they become complex or costly, supporting both dental and general well-being.",1,1751882467.0,u_No-Click4240,0,1.0,False

We've been brewing with the Aiden at the roastery for a while. We have a second unit, since the first one had the ""add water"" error and the wholesaler agreed to replace the brewer.

We've been using the 2nd unit with no issues for a few months and just a few days ago I noticed something weird happening. I'd set up the brew for 1050 ml and I would get a very strong cup that for sure wasn't 1050 ml but way less. I thoght it's a fluke and re-did the brew but it started happening again and again. I started experimenting and weighed the water in vs water out. I did not put any coffee in the filter basket so there's no coffee grounds absorbing water., I just wanted to flush the water basically. I am getting for a 1200 ml brew - something like 960 ml out. For a 1050 ml brew 860. For 1500 ml around 1200 etc etc. 

My questions are: Has anyone experienced this? Is there anything I can do to fix it from my side?

I'm in the process of learning at least whether the water is off by a constant margin - say 1200 in, 960 out every time or if does fluctuate. Will report back. ",2,1751882264.0,FellowProducts,0,1.0,False

I used to work at a volunteer run cafe and loved it, I love making coffees and I love speaking to customers.
I recently got a proper job at a local cafe, and whilst I still love what I did before it's a gorgeous little cafe and the customers are often the sweetest people ever. But I'm really struggling with the owners. I'm not sure if it's all normal though?

 I didn't get training formally more so I'm being taught on the job, which has been mostly fine except for the times where I'm not told something and then reprimanded for not knowing what to do? Is it normal to train staff up or just let them find out on the job? funnily enough a coworker who's been there for 2 years has never been taught how to make matcha so I had to do it cause another coworker showed me how on my first day. The owner complains about restocking not being done but I've never been told where things are or what is my job and what needs to be ordered. 

We also have a £3000 ice-cream machine that's hell to clean and so expensive but a broken ice machine (not cold and doesn't make ice) that we dump ice from the freezer downstairs into and a broken air con they won't fix.

We don't have allergy cards/ingredients for things so if someone asks I don't know. We don't have separate jugs/separate mugs for different milks so often we forget or don't have time to clean them or even know what's what. And our cutlery is positioned so you have to touch the part that'd go in someone's mouth before putting it on the plate? Which all feels a bit like a food safety issue but then maybe I'm just being picky?

I don't know I love the customers, I love my coworkers, I love making coffees and I'm not sure if I'm just being soft cause I'm not used to hard owners. ",3,1751882180.0,barista,1,1.0,False
1ltq420,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1ltq420/boomer_being_deliberately_insular_and_then/,Boomer being deliberately insular and then complaining about it anyway,"My boomer auntie (mid 60s, retired) has mastered the art of making herself miserable by choice due to her being insular and then she had the audacity to constantly complain about it. 

So for context - she lives in a small town with my uncle. They retired there maybe around 15 years ago. The town has decent amenities and surrounded by BEAUTIFUL countryside. They are also not too far from a big city. In other words, she’s got options when she wants to do something but instead of making use of any of that, she sticks to what she knows THEN aggressively complains about how unpleasant it is (due to being stuck in a small town🤪) whilst completely ignoring the better AND OFTEN easier alternatives that are literally **right there**.

EXAMPLE 1:
Most days, she will go on a long walk (a few miles) to keep active. She does this in the main park in her town or does a trail around her neighbourhood (middle class suburb, full of young families). 

Every single time I speak to her or my uncle she complains about these walks even if there’s no point to bring them up. It’s always about the families or kids and how busy everywhere is. She puts her dissatisfaction down to there being a lack of places to walk and lack of greenspace in the town so everywhere ends up in the same places. That is a valid conclusion  HOWEVER as explained, she lives in an area with beautiful countryside where many of the places are not very touristy and quite secluded. She could easily drive (she drives to the park when she goes there) 5 miles in any direction and be in the middle of nowhere or in a much quieter village where she’ll only run into other boomers YET she does a walk every single day that she hates. I’ve asked her why she doesn’t just go somewhere else to walk a million times and she like never responds properly or plays dumb to the rural places nearby. I know plenty of people from her area who will always be out in nature because they have the ability to. 

EXAMPLE 2:
She’s also one of those boomers who insists on going to McDonalds for coffee and acts like she goes because it’s the only option when her town 100% has plenty of better options. Her and my uncle always complains that the coffee is bad that the drive-thru takes forever or they don’t make it correctly but they continue to go.

Even on holidays she’ll hunt down a McDs instead of going to a quaint little cafe. I was away a few weeks ago with her and one of my cousins for a few days to quite a touristy town. My cousin and I went out for lunch one day when she was doing her own thing. We assumed she’d have went to get fish and chips (seaside town, she was talking about how nice she thought the chippy would be) but nope - she got a steak bake from Greggs and then a tea from McDs because there was “nothing else”. She then complained that night that she couldn’t find anywhere to eat and when I looked up the Greggs, it was right beside a super cute cafe with really cheap prices as well as a couple of food stalls serving a variety of things. 

EXAMPLE 3:
On this same holiday, she was determined to go to a traditional Italian ice cream place she looked up beforehand - absolutely fair enough, I love stuff like that. We went and it was good. 

MY ISSUE IS she was making a drama about how she wasn’t going to miss out on “genuine ice cream” until we went. She kept complaining about the few places that do ice cream in her town because that wasn’t “real” ice cream. I mean, I get where she’s coming from because they get it from a supplier (even if it’s of a “traditional brand”) but there’s LITERALLY **a properly** famous Italian ice cream places in the next town over from where she lives. My cousin pointed this out to her and suggested we all go at some point but she acted like she never heard of it and then retconned later in the holiday to make up a convoluted excuse as to why it wasn’t great.

 I have millions more examples but these will do for now but just wanted to vent as I feel like this sorta closed mindedness, one track mind is very boomer. ",1,1751882035.0,BoomersBeingFools,1,1.0,False

I came in at 8pm (I work overnights), and it was already in bad shape. Every screen backed up with a full lobby. I’m on headset taking orders, doing expo, fry station, front window plus trying to take care of front counter. 10pm hits and we lose mostly everyone and we’re down to 3 people as a whole with a line that stayed wrapped around the building from 8pm-1:30am. Nothing was clean, nothing was stocked. We couldn’t get to it. We were doing things as we needed them because that’s how little time we had to even focus on what we were already trying to do. No one got a break, not even a 10 minute or anything. It was a fight just to get to the bathroom… and I’m pregnant. It hits 2:30am & the replacement manager still isn’t there and the 2nd shift manager needs to go home. She gets there finally, over an hour late and walks in and just disappears. 2 people have gone home already & the guy doing window and cashing out is about to go home. This left me doing the entire front alone again. No break still. Not a chance to eat something or take a drink or take my medication. We’re all exhausted, I’m covered in sweat and my feet are so swollen I couldn’t take my shoes off. So this manager comes in and starts picking at me over different things. The coffee, I made it fresh because people were ordering it and she made a remark about how she needed to know because the one by the window was cold. Not what she said, it was the wayyyyy she said it.. I had to clarify 4 times that it was fresh. After she’s aware that we have been going through absolute nonsense the entire night and I’ve been running front alone mostly and she could have made fresh coffee for the other dispenser herself. She disappeared after harping on me over the coffee. I take an order and I’m filling a door dash, I go to search for the seal stickers and ask another girl who’s been there all night for help finding them (I’m still new btw) and she asks why I’m so red and sweaty. I told her I’ve been up there alone for about an hour now and no one is helping me. She comes up to the front and suddenly the manager is up there “helping”. Fine. Finally. So I finish what I’m doing and she starts going on about the receipts. I was only on window until about 11:30 when the dude came in and took that over, so I wasn’t sure what was up with the receipts not printing out. Then I realized they’re printing out at the front counter and I’m trying to explain that to her but she keeps cutting me off in a disrespectful tone saying things like “you’re the crew this is your job”. Just being demeaning and rude… I was finally over the attitude and things she was saying so I told her that she’s being rude for no reason after we’ve been doing the best that we can all night with essentially no help at all, no breaks, no food and no drink. Then she says “well the manager who was here should have made sure the receipts were printing properly”. I’m not a manager so at this point she’s just taking her anger out on me because I’m the only crew member answering her questions. All I said back was “well shouldn’t you be telling these things to the manager then?”. That upset her and she starts going on about how we were here all night and wouldn’t let me speak. She just kept cutting me off so I grabbed my purse and clocked out. I told her this wouldn’t have been so difficult if she weren’t an hour late and were here to at least help figure some of this stuff out while I handled the front alone. I was walking out and she just starting going innnnnn. As if she’s not a manager…. I gave her attitude right back and told her to “suck my d just because you’re a manager doesn’t give you the right to just say what you want to say to people”. And I left. I clocked out and walked outside. SHE FLINGS OPEN THE DRIVE THRU WINDOW and explicitly says “I’ll beat your a$$ know I will”. She’s fully aware I’m pregnant, this is no secret. So I pulled my phone out and started recording and told her to repeat what she said. She just kept trying to taunt me. So I called the police and they asked me to come to the station and file a police report. 


My question is… how far would you take this?? I can’t defend myself and I’m not going to work with someone who can’t control themselves what so ever. She’s a manager and she’s threatening a pregnant woman. I’m 100% filing the police report and calling corporate. She’s writing me up also. For what I’m not really sure. Aside from clocking out before my scheduled time, I didn’t do anything wrong. Nothing that I can be written up for anyways. And with the way she was speaking to me, anyone would have clocked out and left. I said what I said for a reason but I don’t want to keep dealing with this job anymore.

Local culture, cuisine, scenic experiences, offbeat immersion, minimal transfers, no treking. 

Was able to make 2 plans based on this, thanks to chatGPT and wanted the help of the nice people of this subreddit to suggest which would be better and if the itinerary is cramped and should remove a place or so.
Also if some must visit location is missed out.

The house is quiet. There are no meetings, no messages, no one waiting. Just time. It stretches out in every direction, unstructured and unfamiliar.

You wander to the kitchen. The coffee brews out of habit, not desire. The badge is gone. The inbox is gone. What’s left is a space you’re still learning to inhabit.

There are small rituals now. Slower meals. Longer glances out the window. A drawer full of things you once meant to fix.

The shift from doing to simply noticing is subtle and strange. Some thoughts on it are shared in [this piece](https://www.clickworlddaily.com/2025/06/after-badge-after-titles-after-noise.html). Quiet hours. Steady breath. A gentler kind of awareness.

1ltpz42,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1ltpz42/tips_that_you_might_not_have_seen/,tips that you might not have seen,"Disclaimer, this is just one experience of one person! I thought it might be useful to add that I am a white American girl and I would never want my experience to erase the experiences of others! I loved my time in Korea, I was there for a month in the summer and I would totally go again. These are just some things I noticed that I felt like were not said, or maybe there was some fear mongering (lol) surrounding the topic. Overall, I just wanted to add my two cents, because I hadn't seen some of this information before. If you have, sorry!

Netflix:

* Netflix Korea has anime and stuff but sometimes they only have options for Korean dubbing and subtitles. I was watching one piece and had to watch elsewhere because of this. My friend said some of them do have English subs though!

Older Men/Ahjussi

* The “ahjussi stare” is normal and there is 95% of the time no ill intent with their stare, they are truly just a bit nosy/curious (with love from a nosy person)
* Sometimes they will even step in to help you, even if you don’t really “need” it. They just want to make sure things are going well for you, and that you're being taken care of. They might: help you order a coffee, hail a cab for you, get the attendants attention for you, etc. The first few times this happened to me I thought “do I look like an idiot or something” which might still be true, but overall they just want to help you out. It's more of a them thing than anything. They want to feel helpful!

People’s Attire

I see a lot of discourse/fear mongering over what is okay to wear in Korea (especially for women), and I think everyone should wear what they want. But if you’re like me and are wanting to fit in a bit, here it was I noticed. I travelled in June/July so it was HOT.

* Firstly: men wear pretty much the same thing here. A black tshirt, dark wash jeans/dark colored pants, and sneakers. There are variations to this ofc but this is truly the uniform of the masses.

* Tank tops are okay! They usually have a high neckline, but many Korean women wear tank tops and no one thinks twice. I will say that usually they are women who are smaller chested/thinner, as someone who has a fuller chest I feel like sometimes wearing stuff like this can be taken more provocatively and there is nothing I can do about it, so keep that in mind if you want! A lot of the mid-sized girls/girls my size in korea stick to large tshirts and lose pants/shorts and still look super cute/fashionable.
* Midriff/crop tops are not commonly shown/worn. Obviously this is a generalization and I didn’t fit check every Korean lady in the city, but I definitely didn’t see midriff a lot! When I did, it was usually a Chinese girl. From what I’ve seen women here do wear cropped shirts, but their pants are high waisted and everything is covered. If you wanna wear your crop top though, just know that there are Chinese baddies who will be there with you in their crop tops!! (the chinese tourists in korea are fitted out, so please prepare yourself for some truly beautiful women)
* Shorts/skirts are common here, as we all know, legs are not considered scandalous here. However, I do wanna add that the style of shorts is typically loser, and rarely ever is cheek showing lol. And similarly to the tank tops, if you have more junk in the trunk, you might feel a little more scandalous showing your legs, and especially cheek. Think less daisy duke and more jorts
* Final point: wear what you want! Feel good in your clothes!! Don't let anything I, or anyone else, says stop you

Speaking Korean

* In Seoul most people will default to speaking to you in English, and a lot of people (esp those who work in the service industry) speak good English. Elderly are less likely to speak English but that doesn’t mean they don’t! I would never expect anyone to speak English, but just know that many do. But if this is something that you might be worried about, let me ease your mind
* In places like Jeju, speaking even a little Korean will get you a long way. I am by no means fluent and only really knew restaurant/everyday vocabulary and phrases but it still helped me and my friend out. Even then, people have many ways to communicate and I promise you aren’t the first foreigner they’ve met.

Things that weren’t as true in my experience (no hate)

* The air conditioning isn’t as ice cold as people on tiktok and stuff say. I’ve even seen people say “bring a light jacket because it gets cold inside” it doesn’t. Seoul is hot, but you’ll live. I’m from the south and honestly it's cooler here and less humid than back home.
* “Foreigner seats” on trains and buses really aren't a thing here. People will sit/stand next to you even if you're a foreigner. Which *shouldn’t be a surprise* but I see people trying to freak people out about this on tiktok all the time and I just felt like I needed to say that that is NOT TRUE! It’s more true in Japan from my experience. The pregnant/elderly seats here ARE a thing and sometimes they aren’t as obvious as a bright pink chair so be on your toes people!! I saw an elder lady once make sure that the woman sitting in the pink chair was actually pregnant lol 

Waterbomb

* On the way there, many people will wear their normal clothing and change on site. I felt a bit crazy wearing short shorts on the train to Kintex, while everyone was in everyday clothing lol. But they change on site.
* As far as “what to wear” I’d say consider your values. If you want to be in the front pit, getting hosed down, and on your feet for hours, I’d say wear something sensible and comfortable (sporty shorts and a t-shirt with sandals). But if you want that perfect photo opp, wear a nice outfit! There was a fair mix of both in the crowd. Just make sure to wear sunscreen and re-apply :) 
* If you are wanting to get that perfect photo, or do some of the fun popup games they have, get there early! The sprite people had some fun photo opps/games that you should try!",3,1751881505.0,koreatravel,0,0.8,False

The take: I would like a setup that could last me a while not breaking my bank balance.

Grinder options:
Baratza Encore ESP 160€ - wary of noise levels and mess.
Fellow Opus 160€ - internal adjustment seems like a hassle
Mignon manuelle 230€ - In a review I heard it is mainly a dark roast grinder, it this true?
(Optional) DF54 very hard to get in CZ but willing to listen to users 

I like the design of Fellow, or the Metal body of the Mignon yet most people recommend the ESP. Even though to my eye the inside of the grinder looks exactly like the Fellow. I heard that mignons are more expensive everywhere else in the world and still recommended so that drew me there.

Onto the machine:
Lelit anna 440€- love the look and specs of the machine but 57mm portafilter makes me secons guess the decision.
Gagia classic e24 400€- I am not sure the modability is something I will use
Sage/Bambino+ 380€- GF says it looks “plasticky”
Hibrew10A - 160€ non solenoid valve option that has been recommended by a friend, I am not sure a machine without the solenoid is worth it.

I would jump straight for the Lelit if it had a standard portafilter, but the 57mm makes me look at other machines. It is not such a big deal? Gagia looks solid but most people recommens it for its modability down the line. The Bambino seems like a crowd pleaser but doesn’t have the charm of the orher machines.

I am open to suggestions and advice from users and coffee nerds on chosing a combo.

TLDR: would Lelit anna and Mignon Manuelle be a good setup that lasts a while? Are the negatives I listed really present?

# Introduction

Suppose you've dreamed of launching a mobile eatery but don't have the budget for a traditional food truck. In that case, there's a creative, cost-effective alternative—converting an enclosed trailer into a fully functional food kitchen trailer. Whether you're eyeing farmers' markets, food festivals, or lunch rush crowds, starting with a cargo trailer gives you the flexibility to design and build your kitchen on wheels.

In this guide, you'll discover how to transform a simple cargo trailer into a high-performing food kitchen trailer and get your culinary dreams on the road.

# Why Choose an Enclosed Trailer?

# Cost-Effective Investment

Compared to custom-built food trucks, [**enclosed trailers**](https://www.kinematrailerdepot.com/all-inventory/enclosed-car-haulers/) are significantly more affordable. They provide a blank canvas for entrepreneurs who want to build something tailored to their needs without spending a fortune.

# Custom Layout & Flexibility

Since the inside of a cargo trailer is just an empty shell, you can customize the entire layout—from appliance placement to window installation—based on your menu, service style, and workflow preferences.

# Compact and Mobile

[**Food kitchen trailers**](https://www.kinematrailerdepot.com/all-inventory/mobile-kitchen/) are compact, towable, and easy to park. You can detach them from your vehicle, set up in limited spaces, and move them easily to different locations, making them a popular choice for pop-up kitchens and events.

# Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Food Kitchen Trailer

# Step 1: Choose the Right Enclosed Trailer

* **Size Considerations**: A 6x12 or 7x16-foot Trailer is commonly used for food service. Ensure it's large enough to accommodate your equipment and allow for smooth movement.
* **Dual Axles Preferred**: For added stability and to handle the weight of kitchen equipment and water tanks.
* **Condition**: Opt for a well-maintained or new cargo trailer. Avoid rusted or structurally compromised frames.

# Step 2: Design Your Trailer Layout

* **Workflow Planning**: Sketch your layout based on the zones for food preparation, cooking, washing, and serving. Ensure there's a logical flow for efficiency and safety.
* **Serving Windows**: Decide where to install windows to take orders and serve customers.
* **Storage & Prep Areas**: Allocate space for shelves, cabinets, and prep counters.

# Step 3: Install Plumbing & Water Systems

A standard **food kitchen trailer** should include:

* **Freshwater Tank**
* **Greywater Tank**
* **Triple Sink + Hand Wash Sink**
* **On-Demand Water Heater**
* **Water Pump**

Ensure that plumbing is installed according to local health and safety codes.

# Step 4: Add Electrical Systems

* **Lighting**: LED lighting is an energy-efficient option, making it ideal for enclosed spaces.
* **Outlets & Appliances**: Plan electrical needs based on your equipment. Consider separate circuits for refrigerators, fryers, and other high-load devices.
* **Power Source**: You can use a generator, shore power, or solar panels, depending on your operation style.

# Step 5: Install Kitchen Equipment

* **Cooking Equipment**: Grills, burners, fryers, ovens—depending on your menu.
* **Refrigeration**: Commercial-grade fridges and freezers ensure food safety.
* **Prep Tables & Storage**: Use stainless steel surfaces for hygiene and durability.

Ensure all equipment is securely bolted and meets fire safety regulations.

# Step 6: Ensure Proper Ventilation and Fire Safety

* **Hood System**: Install a ventilation hood over any cooking equipment.
* **Fire Suppression**: Some regions require a certified fire suppression system.
* **CO & Fire Alarms**: Add smoke and carbon monoxide detectors for safety.
* **Propane Tanks**: Install with regulators and secure them properly if you're using gas-powered appliances.

# Step 7: Interior Finishes

* **Walls & Ceilings**: Use fire-rated FRP (Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic) panels or stainless steel for easy cleaning and maintenance.
* **Flooring**: Install non-slip vinyl flooring with proper drainage to prevent slips and falls.
* **Insulation**: Add insulation to maintain temperatures and reduce condensation.

# Step 8: Add Signage & Branding

* **Exterior Wrap**: Design a bold and appealing wrap for your trailer that reflects your brand.
* **Menu Boards**: Mount changeable or digital menu boards near the serving window.
* **Lighting**: Consider adding exterior LED lighting for nighttime operation.

# Permits, Regulations, and Licensing

Before launching your **food kitchen trailer**, ensure you meet local and state requirements:

* **Health Department Permits**: Your Trailer must pass health inspections for sanitation, storage, and food safety.
* **Business License**: Register your business and obtain the necessary licenses to operate legally.
* **Fire Safety Inspection**: Required if you're using gas or open flames.
* **Commissary Kitchen**: Some areas require your Trailer to be linked to a licensed commissary or base kitchen.

Always consult your local health department early in the process to avoid delays or compliance issues.

# Budgeting for Your Build

While costs vary depending on size, condition, and customizations, here's a general breakdown (without a detailed table):

* **Enclosed Trailer**: $4,000 to $12,000
* **Basic Conversion Materials**: $5,000 to $15,000
* **Kitchen Equipment**: $3,000 to $20,000
* **Labor (DIY vs. Professional)**: Savings can be substantial if you DIY, but professional builders ensure code compliance.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Skipping Permits** – Always Check Local Regulations Before Building.
2. **Poor Layout Design** – An inefficient kitchen flow can significantly impact productivity.
3. **Undersizing Electrical and Plumbing Systems** – Plan for future upgrades.
4. **Using Non-Commercial Equipment** – Must meet health and safety standards.

# Final Reveal: Your Fully Converted Food Kitchen Trailer

Imagine your enclosed Trailer parked at a bustling farmers' market. Inside, a clean, efficient, and fully operational food kitchen trailer serves up your signature dishes. With custom branding, thoughtful layout, and the right gear, your mobile kitchen is ready to impress—and earn.

# Conclusion

Converting a cargo trailer into a food kitchen trailer is more than just a DIY project—it's the start of your entrepreneurial journey. With careful planning, a reasonable budget, and the right equipment, your enclosed Trailer can become a powerful mobile business that fuels your passion and your customers' needs.

Whether you're starting a coffee shop on wheels or a taco stand with flair, this conversion offers a cost-effective, flexible way to launch your dream.

Starting a story is never easy, but I suppose this one begins the night I met her. Like many stories, it led to an unexpected place in my case, a police station (not for the first time). But before I dive into that chaotic night, I should probably explain how I ended up in London to begin with.

I can still picture my parents' faces when I told them. We were sitting at that old kitchen table, which hadn't changed a bit since the late '80s.

""Mum, Dad, I'm moving to London.""

""Why on earth would you want to do that?"" my dad asked, his brow furrowed.

""Because... I'm going to be an artist.""

Their reactions were almost comical. My parents probably hadn’t had sex since the late '80s (which doesn't quite add up since they had me—I'm twenty-three, by the way—but you get the idea). I don't think I'd seen them make eye contact in years, except for those rare moments when they watched me open Christmas presents, back when I was still in single digits. So, when they both erupted into laughter at the same time, it almost frightened me.

""Not this again. You pull this stunt every year. I thought you'd have grown out of it by now. Listen, one of the interns at work dropped out, and I was talking to Magee about you. Get that stupid makeup off your face, comb your hair, and I'll get you a suit. I reckon I could get you in. You just have to stop saying weird shit, keep your head down, and you'll be fine. We all have to do it at some point. We all start off as dreamers, lad, but you have to grow up. Heck, I thought I was going to learn the harmonica once, but I sobered up, got myself an interview at Hammond and Sons, and never looked back. Monday, I’ll take you into the office. That's a week away, enough time to square you up and get you looking normalish,"" said my dad.

""We won’t be, because I have a job to go to that day,"" I replied.

""Horse shit. Who's employing you?""

""I met a guy online...""

""Oh, right. Is this you coming out as gay as well? Wouldn't surprise me.""

""He's looking for a barman. Long hours, but he's also got a room he's giving me rent-free...""

""What are you talking about? In London? This sounds like a load of queer shit to me.""

""Dad, it’s not queer. He owns a pub. It’s an opportunity.""

""My twenty-year-old son, who wears fucking eyeliner and thinks he’s a painter, wants to move to London to live rent-free with some guy. That’s a fucking rent boy. You know, Mary, this is your fault.""

""I'm twenty-three.""

""If you go on with this nut job dream, then that’s it. You’re out. Now, I want you to think very hard about that before you go and fuck up your life. Because I tell you now, if you do go, you'll be on the street in no time, doing God knows what just to feed yourself... I can see it now. You going to say anything, Mary?""

We both turned to look at my mum. A thin woman in a faded blue blouse, her hair now entirely grey, lips tightly pursed. She stared at the ground, but I knew that faraway look in her eyes, the faint smile playing on her face. Slowly, she reached for her teacup and brought it to her lips, the slurp confirming what we both already knew—she wasn’t really here. She must have taken her meds recently.

“Now listen…” my dad said, pushing aside his coffee mug, the one with the picture of a man fishing on it. He leaned in, resting his elbows on the table. His face was flushed, that deep red hue that I always associated with the years of scotch he used to drink. It had been a decade since he last touched a drop, but his face had never returned to its natural colour.

“You can live in this little fantasy world if you want. Like I said, I get it. You’re dreaming. But at some point, son, you have to wake up. I’m a lot older than you; I’ve seen how this plays out. You get these ideas, start thinking you’re going to be something, someone, but the truth is, you’re not. You’re just another nobody. The best way to get through life is to get in line and do what you’re told. It’s a lot easier that way. Hope only leads to disappointment. I want you to stay in the safe lane with me. I know we haven’t always seen eye to eye, but… I am your dad. I do care about you. Now, put this nonsense aside and listen to your old man for once. I could make you into someone I could be proud of. I’m sure of it.”

I stared at his moustache. It was so incredibly thick, the kind of coarse that seemed like it could cut you if you ran your hand over it.

“I don’t want your life, Dad. I want mine. And it isn’t here…” My voice trembled as I spoke, a knot forming in my throat. I wasn’t sure why I suddenly felt like crying—maybe it was the way he always made me feel, or perhaps it was fear of his reaction. He held my gaze for a few seconds before leaning back in his chair. Then, without a word, he got up and left the room. 

I remember glancing over at Mum in the kitchen. Her eyes slowly lifted to meet mine, and for a moment, we just stared at each other. Her smile—it wasn’t the usual distant, dreamy one. It seemed to change, to come alive, even if just for a fleeting second. Then, just as quickly, she looked back down at the floor. I don’t know why, but I got up and, for the first time since I was probably ten, I leaned in and hugged her. She didn’t move, but I kissed the top of her head, pressing my lips against her thinning grey hair, and whispered, “I love you, Mum.”

The house, even at its best, was never truly alive. Not since I’d been an adult. People moved through it, but it wasn’t a home. It always felt quiet, stiflingly so. Nobody talked, and if they did, it was about the weather or what was for tea. We weren’t a family—just three people living under the same roof. The house was immaculate, thanks to my mother. Yet it felt stuck in time, trapped in the ‘90s with its floral wallpaper and an overabundance of varnished wood. Some might call it suburbia, but it wasn’t—it was eerier than that, and I lived there. It never felt like a home. The strangest part is, I bet my parents felt the same; we all felt like intruders.

“What’s for tea, darling?”  
“Shepherd’s pie.”  
“Right-o.”

That was probably the most the walls heard in a twenty-four-hour period. The only other sounds came from the TV at night as my dad watched it, its muffled voices leaking through the walls as I lay in my bedroom. I hadn’t been allowed in the living room until I was eighteen, and when I finally was, I didn’t want to be. It felt like I was breaking some unspoken rule.

I’m telling you all this because, despite how lifeless the house had felt throughout my teenage years and beyond, that last week somehow felt even worse. The soft mumbling of the TV had gone silent, and my dad no longer asked my mum what was for tea. I’d simply find my meal on the table, and they wouldn’t join me. Strangely, I felt guilty even turning on the lights that week.

The atmosphere weighed heavily on me. Just walking past my dad put a lump in my throat, as if my mere presence was an unwelcome intrusion. Before, I’d felt a mix of nerves and apprehension about leaving for London, but now, all I could think about was escaping that house.

Sunday arrived. For many, Sunday is a day of rest, a peaceful refuge. But in a world where nothing happens, Sunday is brutal. I remember my mum sitting at the kitchen table, a cup of tea beside her, legs crossed. That was it—no phone, no book, nothing—just sitting there. I walked in, feeling like I shouldn’t be there, and took the bread out of the cupboard, dropping it into the toaster. As I reached for the butter near the sink, I noticed something different in the house that never changed. In the dish drainer by the sink was a glass—a tumbler. I knew immediately that my dad had been drinking scotch. I doubted he had much, maybe just one glass, maybe two, perhaps late last night. At the time, I didn’t fully understand why, but now I think I do.

Living in that house felt like being nearly dead. But with me leaving… the thought of being alone with my mum, doped up into something that looked human but wasn’t, must have been too much for him to bear. Late last night, as he imagined that future, it must have overwhelmed him. Though it felt like my dad hated me at the time, I’m sure he didn’t. He was just like a lot of men, struggling to show emotion, especially when that emotion was something close to love. I never knew my grandad, but I have a feeling my dad came from a hard house. Maybe he was beaten a lot; I don’t know. But showing love wasn’t something he could do—to him, it probably felt like a weakness. No, rather than feel weak, he would numb the pain. So, the scotch came back out.

I couldn't help but glance at my mum at that moment. When those glasses turned into five, six a night, how would she fare? Would she even care? Maybe not.

I packed my bag—a big black rucksack—with just a few clothes. It was a fresh start, and I’d decided to live my life as minimally as possible. I didn’t want material possessions; not really. It’s all bullshit, I often reminded myself. What’s real are thoughts, feelings, being present. I hope that makes sense. A few grey vests, my black denim jeans, and the leather jacket I’d picked up once on a trip to Manchester. 

No, what mattered more were books—the kind you find in charity shops for 50p. Get your head in one of those, and you’re away, happy. I see so many people on social media, absorbing algorithms designed to appeal to their most basic instincts—designed to agitate, to anger—providing nothing but stress. Social media isn’t entertainment; it’s stimulus. And people have forgotten to question whether it’s good or bad. It’s just something. It provides them with little education or reason. I feel sorry for the vast majority, especially those my age, absorbed by their own vanity, talking to people who mean nothing to them on their phones when they could be creating much more meaningful experiences. If only they practiced a little more gratitude for what they have and spent a bit more time in nature and study.

Maybe that’s all a bit patronising. I mean, what do I know? Maybe I’m just as egotistical as the rest of them. Maybe even more so, considering what’s happened this past year and where I am now. Anyway, that Sunday...

There was one thing I had to do. I had to go see my mate, Tony Toyne. Tony had never really grown up (though my dad would probably say the same about me). We grew up differently. I became interested in art and literature; he never got past the Premier League and playing football games on his PlayStation. Even though we both knew we’d grown apart over the last few years, we didn’t let it stop us from being mates. Though I have to admit, it did get a little harder each year.

I left our house—a detached place with a big garden in front and back, perfectly cut grass, and rose bushes galore—and walked through the village. Well, it was really a hamlet, if you know what that is. I passed the little post office and the same dog walkers I’d seen all my life. They never changed, even when their dogs did. It’s funny how people stick to routines, isn’t it? I walked by the pub where Tony and I got leathered (which means ""drunk as fuck,"" in case you didn't know) when we were sixteen. Everyone knew it, and I had to stay at his house because my dad would’ve leathered me too (that’s ""kicked the shit out of me,"" if you didn’t know). Then I arrived at Tony’s street.

The houses there were small, built in the seventies, council-owned, and, according to most people in the village, an eyesore. My dad always said they weren’t “in keeping” with the village’s charm—a phrase I’d heard tossed around plenty.

I walked through the little gate, stepping over a tattered football, and knocked on his door. His mum answered, wearing a silk dressing gown. She was skinny, with dyed black hair and bags under her eyes. I could smell the dope, and she was probably a bit drunk. She had one of those noses with a bump on the bridge—not exactly attractive, but in some strange way, I found her appealing. Maybe it was just because she was thin, or because she was so different from my mum, or maybe because her legs were almost entirely on show, and I could tell she was tipsy. She shouldn’t have been sexy, but there was an allure that I don’t think any woman would ever understand.

“Mr. Robinson, it’s really nice to see you,” she said, her smile a bit too genuine. In this fake world, that can be startling.

“Hi, Sandra. Is Tony in?”

“Yeah, I think so. So you didn’t come to see me then?” she teased.

“Ah, I came to see both of you…” I replied, trying to keep it light.

“Course you did. He’s in the back room,” Sandra said as she walked into her house. 

There was always a musty smell in their home. The dope was a constant, but this was something else—more like the scent of neglect. That might sound harsh, but it wasn’t that they were dirty or unclean exactly; it was more that Tony’s mum didn’t seem to care much about washing clothes. I guess that’s where most of the smell came from. To be fair, it wasn’t all on her. We were guys in our twenties—Tony could have taken more responsibility himself.

When I opened the door to the back room—his bedroom, though she never called it that—I found Tony sitting at the end of his double bed, eyes glued to the 48-inch TV he'd bought on finance and been paying off for the last three years. He was still paying for it, and it was already going out of fashion. He was wearing a tracksuit I didn’t recognise; it must have been new.

“Jay. She didn’t try it on with you, did she?” he asked, his eyes flickering over the screen, which cast a green hue from the football game he was playing. I was surprised he’d heard me come in, but he took off his headset. “Sorry, it’s an important one—win this, and I go up a league…”

“Nah, she didn’t. Shame...” I said, sitting beside him on the bed. A small smile played on his lips.

“You still going ahead with it then?”

“Bags packed. Just need to buy my train ticket,” I replied, watching his eyes flicker as the controller clattered in his hands.

“You bastard,” he said. I looked at the screen—his player had just been shown a red card by the referee. “Not a fucking chance. He’s having a laugh,” Tony muttered. I let the game continue; it was clear he wasn’t ready to talk yet. So I lay back on the bed, noticing the cans of beer in his mini fridge—the kind with the glass door, illuminated by blue light. They looked tempting, even if it was probably cheap stuff. I resisted the urge, since I had a job interview the next day.

His game ended, but I couldn’t tell if he’d won or lost by the way he got up and lay beside me, both of us staring at the ceiling.

“We haven’t done this in a long time, have we?” he said.

“Nah. Probably the last time.”

“You sure you want to go?”

“More than anything.”

“Why?”

“Why wouldn’t I?”

“Aren’t you happy here?”

“No.”

“I know your dad’s a bit of a dick, mate, but maybe you could get a job at the pub. That barmaid’s off to uni soon…”

“I don’t want to work in the pub.”

“You told me that’s what you were going to do.”

“Yeah, but it’s not about the pub. It’s not about pulling pints. It’s about moving.”

“I don’t get it…” he said, getting up to grab a beer from the fridge. He brought one over for me, and I couldn’t resist this time.

“What about Williamson’s Farm? I reckon that’d be good money, a fresh start. From what I heard at the pub the other night, the old man doesn’t want any more foreigners. I reckon a couple of young local lads like us are just what he’s looking for. How about I have a word next Friday when he’s had a few?”

“Nah, man. It’s not about that. It’s not big enough. I want the unknown…” I said, gulping some beer and sitting up.

“I don’t get it,” Tony said.

“I don’t expect you to… you’re not like me,” I said. I saw him smirk and look away, but it wasn’t a smile. I knew him well enough to know he didn’t like that one bit.

“I didn’t mean it like that…”

“Yeah, yeah. You’re an artist, you’re deep... I’m just some thicko who could never comprehend what you want. I get it.”

“I didn’t say that. And I don’t mean that at all.”

“Whatever.”

“Come on, you know it. We’re different. And that’s not a bad thing…”

“Just for the record, it was you that changed, not me. I’ve always stayed the same…” he said. And it was the way he said it—proud, like it was something to be admired. While to me, I couldn’t think of anything worse.

“Exactly,” I said. He looked back at me then, and I wasn’t sure how he was going to take it. But I could see the cogs turning, and something had clicked. Whether it was good or bad, I wasn’t sure yet, but I felt a bit tense.

“I don’t know what you want, Jason. You really think it’s all it’s cracked up to be down in London? Because to be honest, I don’t hear much good.”

“Again, you don’t really understand. You know… I feel like my life has never really started. My story. Like… how can this be it? This little village. I’ve never left chapter one. And I get it—that’s all some people need, and maybe they’re the clever ones. The hobbits that never left the Shire are none the wiser to the evils in the world. But that isn’t me…”

“What’s your old man said?”

“Accused me of going off to be a rent boy.” Tony laughed, spilling some beer on his bed.

“Your mum?”

“I don’t think she’s there anymore, not emotionally. High on her antidepressants. She just exists.”

“Look, I get it, I do. But I think you’re gonna be back here in six months. You’ll realise it’s not all it’s cracked up to be. You’ll meet some new people, sure, but they won’t be anything special. They won’t have your back. You probably won’t even like any of them. You’ll be back here, at your parents’, living the same old mundane life. It’s just how it is.”

I don’t think he could have been more wrong.

We got off the topic. I played some games with him, for old times’ sake. We hugged at his door, which wasn’t like us, but the beers had helped with that. As he waved his phone in the dark at me, he said he’d always be there for me. I walked through the village and didn’t see a soul the whole way.

As I approached my house, I could see the flickering lights behind the drawn blinds in the living room. My dad was watching TV.

I entered the house like a ghost, shutting the door as quietly as possible. I took off my shoes, placing them softly on the carpet instead of the shoe rack, not wanting to make a sound. As I passed the living room door, I heard him.

“Jason,” he said, his voice unusually deep. There was something different in his tone—some kind of emotion. “Get yourself in here now.” It was strange to hear him speak like that. He hadn’t spoken to me that way since I was a child. It was like he’d forgotten what year it was. I walked into the living room, which was split into two areas, with one further back, where the shutters were always open. The beige carpet and the dim blue light from the TV cast a cold, almost surreal atmosphere.

“Are we going to talk about this?” he asked, still staring at the TV. That’s when I noticed the glass tumbler in his hand, and the nearly empty bottle of scotch on the wooden coffee table.

“What do you want to talk about?” I asked.

“Were you even gonna say goodbye?” I shrugged my shoulders. He wasn’t looking at me, but when I didn’t respond, he finally turned my way. His eyes were wet—like he’d been crying. It was one of the strangest sights I’d ever seen.

“I dunno,” I said, feeling a lump grow in my throat. It wasn’t about emotions towards him; it was just that he was making me uncomfortable.

“Don’t you care?” he asked.

“About what?”

“About me…” I almost couldn’t believe what I was hearing.

“Why would I?”

“I’m your dad.”

“Shame you never acted like it…”

“I put food on that table for you, for the last twenty years! Don’t you tell me I haven’t been a good parent.”

“I don’t think you’ve ever asked me a single question about me. Only if it affected you somehow.”

“It works both ways…” he muttered, tipping the whisky back and unscrewing the cap of the bottle. “Sit down,” he said.

“Nah, I’m good tha—”

“Sit down!” The way he said it was vicious—loud, with saliva spitting onto his shirt as he glared at me. I’ll admit, I got scared then. I’d never seen him like that. Something wasn’t right. I walked in and sat at the far end of the green leather sofa, which was hard and uncomfortable.

“I want you to really think about what you’re doing. I guess it’s tomorrow you’re going?” he asked, screwing the cap back on the now-empty bottle. I didn’t answer; I just stared at the TV.

“Answer me,” he demanded, his breathing getting heavier.

“Yeah,” I replied, really not wanting to be there.

“No changing your mind?”

“No…”

“Right. If you walk out that door, you don’t ever come back, do you hear me?” I didn’t answer.

“You horrible, ignorant little shit. I said, did you hear me?”

“Yeah,” I said. I tried, but I couldn’t help it. My voice wavered, and I fought back the tears. Looking back, if that “yeah” had come out clean and strong, he probably wouldn’t have done what he did next. He got up, walked across the room. I didn’t dare look at him as he approached, but his shadow loomed over me, blocking out the TV. He grabbed me by the neck, pushing my head back into the hard leather. I did everything I could not to look into his eyes. I could smell the alcohol on his breath as he leaned in close to my ear.

“You horrible little cunt,” he spat, pausing for a moment. I felt his fingernails begin to dig into my skin, then suddenly, he let go. Maybe he wasn’t getting the reaction he wanted. His hand loosened, and he stood up again. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him raise the tumbler to his mouth. “You ain’t no son of mine…” he muttered, turning back to his chair and slumping into it. It was the slump of a drunk man just beginning to realise he was a bit fucked.

For some reason, I remember what was on TV. It was an episode of some reality show. Had he been watching that? A bit of mindless entertainment. Probably, given that the scotch had likely mellowed him out. A fifty-year-old habit of hiding behind a gruff exterior. Maybe the alcohol made him a little more carefree for once.

It was at the point when the male contestant was about to reveal something. I remember it clearly. The music intensified, and there he was, walking back into the studio, looking somewhat exposed on the screen. My dad’s attention was glued to the TV. I, slumped back in the chair, glanced over at him.

“This your kind of thing?” I asked.

“Get out,” he snapped, reaching for the remote and quickly changing the channel.

Maybe there had been some hesitation on my part. Maybe I wasn’t entirely committed to leaving. But after my dad’s reaction, it felt like it was really going to happen. I say this because I hadn’t actually booked my train ticket until that moment. I did it on my phone, typing in King's Cross, and noticing that the website listed it as King's X. I booked it, and the email came through: *Thanks, enjoy your journey tomorrow at 12:43*.

I’d been on trains before, but not often. Last summer, I convinced Tony to join me to see a band called Softplay (don’t let the name fool you; they really rocked). He didn’t enjoy it much. He kept to himself, getting some odd looks from people. I think he felt out of place that day. Anyway, I don’t know why I’m telling you this. Maybe because another thing on my mind, besides the train, was my financial situation. I had just over a grand. My grandma left it to me. I barely knew her, but I made sure to lay flowers on her grave as a quiet thank you. I did it when nobody was around, because, don’t you notice how people these days only do nice things if someone’s watching? It’s all about appearances now, especially on social media. It’s something that bothers me. Anyway, I’m getting off track again.

Money and London. Not the best combination—at least, not if you don’t have much. Maybe it’s a great place if you do. The way I saw it, my grandma’s money was just to get me there, really. I’d found this opportunity by searching for pubs in London on Google Maps, checking out their Facebook pages, and sending messages, specifically asking if anyone had a place to stay. In return, I offered to work all hours under the sun (within reason). I barely used Facebook, but a guy who owned a pub in Camden got back to me. He said I was probably the kind of person he was looking for. I didn’t know what that meant at the time, but now I do.

He must have seen my profile picture—the dyed black hair, gelled and spiked, the heavy eyeliner, the leather necklace. My ripped clothes, maybe even the scuffed black boots. I was naïve back then. I’m sure plenty of people took one look at that picture and thought I was the last person they’d ever consider hiring. But there's someone out there for everyone, and somehow, I was the one he picked. He mentioned he had a room he “couldn’t rent out for legal reasons.” I didn’t understand what that meant at the time. But I wasn’t going to argue. The next day, I’d find out exactly what he meant.

1ltplz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1ltplz7/my_complex_situation_transferring_out_of_my_store/,My complex situation transferring out of my store at Starbucks,"Hi everyone, I’m really hoping for some advice here because I’m feeling completely stuck, im also new to reddit so if im not following certain format i apologize . I’ve already tried the official channels (ethics/compliance, upper management, etc.) but I keep hitting dead ends, and I don’t know who else to ask because this is turning into the biggest headache and this situation isn't common apparently (not that i could find) so this is a huge Hail mary

I’m trying to transfer out of my current store. However the problem is they recently changed its transfer policy, and it’s making this impossible. The new rule says you can’t transfer if you’ve had a written warning within the last six months. Unfortunately, I do have one on file.

The tricky part is that I *have* to move, and the manager at the store I’m trying to transfer to is willing to take me immediately. But my current manager insists I still have to wait six months, even in cases involving relocation. When I asked who else I could escalate this to, they told me there’s “technically no one to speak to” about it (which honestly feels sketchy to me. They didn’t even mention anyone higher up, like a district manager or HR rep). The distance I am moving will literally vary so much since i would be taking a longer route and traffic is insane.

I'm trying to go in a month (which the other store manager said they would take me on the next schedule asap if they could since my hours completely align what they are looking for), but im legitimately gonna get more write ups from being late to work which i can't control unless i go extra early, but the new store is close by to me which would just avoid the problem and i have never had an attendance issue before

I’m terrified I’ll be forced to quit over this, which would hurt me financially and academically (I’m a student, and i rely on this job to stay afloat). I know it’s “just coffee,” but this situation feels overwhelming, and I really don’t know what to do next.

If anyone here has advice, knows how to navigate situations like this, or can point me toward any options I haven’t tried, I’d really appreciate it. I feel completely trapped right now by my manager and im not sure what the next step would be... if you guys need more details im ready, need ALL the help i can get",1,1751880064.0,starbucks,4,1.0,False

Today welcomes you with a delightful mix of weather moods to keep you on your toes. As the day begins, expect clear skies and a gentle breeze, perfect for a morning stroll along the beach or a refreshing dip in the ocean. The sun will be playing peek-a-boo throughout the day, so don't forget your sunglasses to keep up with its antics.

Remember to grab your sunscreen before heading out because those sunny intervals can be pretty deceiving! By midday, some fluffy clouds might gather, teasing you with the possibility of a brief shower—perhaps nature's way of adding a sprinkle of excitement to your day. So, if you're out and about, consider bringing along a trusty umbrella to stay dry when those unexpected raindrops start their dance.

The mood today is a mix of adventurous spontaneity and laid-back coastal vibes. Embrace the sunny moments with a big smile, and when the clouds decide to join the party, why not seek refuge in a cozy café for a hot cup of local coffee? Be prepared for a day full of surprises, just like the ever-changing skies above. Stay flexible, stay positive, and let the weather be your playful companion in your Puerto Morelos escapades!",1,1751879718.0,PuertoMorelos,0,1.0,False

I know how physically and emotionally demanding the job can be, so tipping feels natural to me.

But I’ve met people who say tipping at a coffee shop is unnecessary — they say, “you’re already paying for the drink, so why add more?” That made me wonder: is this just a personal habit, or is it actually common and expected?

I’m curious to hear how others think about it — especially if it depends on where you live or your background.

My Green Eyed Lover,

This is the most important thing I’ve ever written. No filters. No bravado. Just truth, from the heart. A letter not from a man trying to win something, but from a man who already found everything when he found you.

When we first truly connected, not as friends, but as two aching hearts seeking quiet in a loud world it felt small at first. A moment. A snuggle. Just comfort between friends. But it wasn’t small. It was everything.  Those green eyes saw my soul that night and my blue eyes saw your soul that night! I didn’t know it then, but the moment you leaned into me, fully clothed, fully human, fully you!  You rewrote what peace meant to me. I had been through chaos, betrayal, false starts, and endings that pretended to be beginnings. But that night, with your breath near mine and your body gently pressed to my chest, my soul sighed for the first time in years. 
Also just to be 100% honest what happened the next morning, truly was an accident!  I remember thinking, oh my god I just??  You know the rest of the story, so I will leave it at that!  

We weren’t thinking of falling in love. We were healing. But in healing, we uncovered something purer than either of us expected, something rare. We didn’t choose it. It chose us and it was love! This is not completely true, when I left your house that morning, yes! I was in love with you!

Loving you has been the most real thing I’ve ever done. I had no idea unconditional love was something that could exist in my world, until you showed me. You showed me what unconditional love felt and looked like. You didn’t just love me, you saw me. And in return, I gave you the best love I knew how. I saw you and my god are you beautiful! I have never seen such Beaty, on the inside and absolutely the outside! I loved you unconditionally and without expectation, but I now see that even the deepest love can’t thrive without healing. And it wasn’t the love that failed, it was the unhealed parts of me that I hadn’t yet faced. That’s on me and I will forever be sorry for that!

Please hear this: I heard you. Every word you said. Every truth you offered, even the hard ones. And I didn’t let them pass. For the past four and a half months, I’ve been showing up twice a week, sitting with the mirror, letting my therapist walk with me through the wreckage and the reasons, the fears and the scars. I’m not doing this for a second chance. I’m doing it because you were the mirror that made me realize I had to change because I want to love the right way and I wanted to love you the right way! And because all I want, is for you to be proud to love me back.

You are not just any woman. You are the first woman I have ever truly, undeniably, and wholeheartedly loved. Not in a “forever sounds good” kind of way. But in the way that makes me certain!  Certain that I will marry you someday, if you allow me the honor? That if I die before you, my soul will stay with you, quietly holding your hand as you sleep. Because my love doesn’t end at death. It doesn’t even end at failure. It only deepens. It only begins again.

I promise on everything that matters to me, that if you choose to hand me your heart one more time, I will hold it like we both know it deserves to be held!  With kindness, softness, with certainty and with love! You will never hear my voice raised in anger, ever. Not once. The only thing that will separate me from you again will be my final breath. And even then, my love stays.

I want the life we almost had and so much more! With all seven of our children! With all the messy, imperfect, magical moments that come with blending souls and stories. To me, this is the perfect love. A perfect love, we both deserve! I want our love, unconditional love from both sides! I want the hard days, the belly laughs, the quiet mornings, the coffee in bed, the hand squeezes in the car, the hold you as you fall asleep, the forgiveness when we’re tired, the honesty when we’re scared, the deep knowing that we are no longer alone in this life.

This is not just my truth. This is me and you and it’s our truth. This is a chance to start new, with the communication we both desire and the love we both want. For you. God, for us. To what I know is the greatest love story ever told not because it’s flawless, but because it is absolutely real. And real love? It deserves to be fought for, it deserves to never be given up on, so it can rise. And sometimes, it deserves a second or third chance.

So here I am. All in. 100%. No armor, no ego, no games. Just me, healed and healing, loving and ready to be loved!

If even a piece of your heart still remembers what we felt, I’m here. I am already home. All that’s missing is you, my true love!

Forever and Always
Your Blue Eyed Love (S)

I used to have a lot of penpals when I was in school, and I really miss that kind of slow, meaningful connection. There’s something beautiful about exchanging thoughts, stories, and little pieces of life with someone you may never meet - just honest, human connection without judgment or pressure.

I’d love to revive that feeling in today’s world - whether that’s through long emails or app messages.

A bit about me:  
📍 33F based in India  
🌱 Ambivert, curious observer, tea over coffee kind of person  
📚 I love meaningful conversations, quiet hobbies, and random deep thoughts

1ltpas8,https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/1ltpas8/things_i_take_that_work_and_those_i_take_which/,"Things I take that work, and those I take which might work...","Been lifting for 17/18 years. Now over 50 and, I guess, a seasoned lifter (even if I think we never reach the top of the learning curve). I thought it would be worth starting a discussion about what demonstrably works (in terms of what we consume) and what *might* work. So, I'll start:

**What Works** 

• Creatine. Not controversial - I have seen it help with my strength and improves fullness. Other potential benefits (vascular, recovery, cognitive) but not observable. I take 8/9 grms per day (weigh 95kgs)

• Porridge oats. 100grms or so per day has helped bring my cholesterol down from slightly high to ideal range for my age

• Collagen peptides. A new one for me, been taking a bovine collagen peptide (10grms) for around three months and have seen minor improvements in skin - perhaps not related to bodybuilding, but hey, we are all trying to look better I guess?

• A steak a day. Been eating a small steak (with eggs and avocado) as my final meal each day for the last several months (instead of greek yogurt/more ad hoc choices) and I have added a few reps to the final set of a bench that has been static for more than a year. Your mileage may vary but I thought I should share my data point of one!

  
**What** ***May*** **Work**

• Fish oil. No proof it works but take it as a daily

• Multi-vitamin. As above - worth taking as inexpensive 'just in case'

• Vitamin D. Take 5,000 IU per day - likely to work but not observable

• Pre-workout. As a non-drinker, and non-coffee drinker, I enjoy the buzz of a PWO 2x per week on leg day. But I can't say it improves concentration or ability to put in a bigger shift at the gym

Anyway, welcome thoughts of the sub particularly on things they take that work for you. ",15,1751878879.0,naturalbodybuilding,9,0.83,False

1ltp98l,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaturatedFat/comments/1ltp98l/ex_kempner_replicating_exfatloss_experiment/,Ex_Kempner - replicating ExFatLoss' experiment,"ExFatLoss recently run an experiment on Kempner rice diet which failed due to excessive hunger / no weight loss.

I suggested the reason for it that the rice & some fruit may be contaminated with metabolic disruptors during cooking / processing, hiking up hunger levels. Ensuring no contamination should make the diet work (and by 'work' I mean hunger down, energy stable or up & some weight loss)

I have tested this over last week.


The Protocol

- eat ad-lib rice, washed, cooked on stove in uncoated stainless steel pot, with excess water & drained. Why?

> white rice is processed - by removing the outer bran & packaging, so would have come into contact with plastic conveyor belts & tubing by the time it lands on the table. Washing & boling in excess water & drained should minimise contaminants eaten. 
> rice cookers / instapots have either plastic cooking containers or plastic or silicone gaskets, thus contaminating the rice during cooking. 

- eat ad-lib whole fruit, peelable & peeled at home or at least scalded in hot water. Why?

> fruit is often waxed with parrafin (containing plasticisers) or natural waxes. Once waxed, it generally travels through conveyor belts / gets stored in plastic packaging, with the wax picking up contaminants on the way. Keeping them in hot water removes some of the wax (this is a tip from subs on veg/fruit wax allergies!)


Results

Prior week lowest weight: 94.5kg 
This week lowest weight: 93.4 kg 
Average AT-LIB kcal eaten: 1045kcal
Energy levels: Good to very good


Notes:

- I did not exactly love rice, even when cheating with a bit of seasoning. It was ok, but had way more fruit than rice, which I really enjoyed eating. Which makes sense- if you have enough energy from fat reserves flooding around, why would you fancy eating something that brings energy but no nutrients to the table?

- This is all AT-LIB. My (energy) hunger was pretty much non existent. I only count calories because they are a reasonable measure of (energy) appetite, not to restrict them. So much fruit sugar made no difference. 

- Energy hunger dropped from 1500-1600kcal at-lib last week (on no-food contact plastic diet) gradually down to around 1000kcal at-lib where it settled. This is as expected - for a mono(ish) diet that is as plasticiser free as it gets - very similar to potato diet.  

- Nutrient hunger became a problem from day 5 onwards - I was constantly thinking of very specific foods - eggs of all things - and gave in & had them. However, 'energy' hunger stayed at the same low level after eating them. 

- Energy wise, there was a dip in energy levels to start with, then energy up. I tried to see the limits of this by going on a long cycle - 2.5hrs ok, anything beyond that was a struggle & was tired most of Sun. There is certainly a limit to how much energy from fat is available!  Again, this is very similar to the experience of SMTM potato dieters (though clearly I did not get to 'manic' levels as some people report there).

- serious increase in thirst - I drank 1.5-2x more water than usual. 


What now?

Would I do this again & for longer? YES, but would have to have some nutrient refeeds / electrolytes if exercising. 

The nutrient profile of this diet is very poor. White rice is totally devoid of nutrients (you're only getting water soluble vitamins from fruit - probably in excess - and some potassium). There's no protein, soluble fats, fat soluble vitamins, calcium & little magnesium. Sooner or later, nutrient cravings (rather than 'lack of energy' hunger) will get you - and it will be a lot sooner than carnivore, cream based diet or potato diet. 

Oh, but hang on, historic Asian populations were eating  like 90% rice, right? Sure, but the other 10% was meat, organs, eggs from a good range of animals or a variety of seafood & seaweeds or at the very least all manner of fermented foods & sauces - i.e. some of the most nutrient dense foods available. That 10% was important.

@ExFatLoss - would you consider giving Ex_Kempner another go, on this protocol? Same guy, same food, only difference - food processing? [or (lower) food contact plastic ex150, if that's more aligned to what you are doing now?]

If anyone else fancies testing it (for whatever lenght of time you choose) please post your results. So far it seems to work for two people - Whats_up_Coconut & me.

I (28F) was with someone (28M) about five years ago. We were together for ~1.5 years. We started off as great friends, and over time, we slowly, steadily, and beautifully fell in love. Like any relationship, we had frictions but it was real and both of us acknowledged it big time. He is very hardworking and ambitious.

About a year into the relationship, out of nowhere, he ghosted me for nearly a month. I tried speaking but felt like he was falling out. He then out of nowhere “texted” he was moving to the US for a job which happened to work out last minute. I was blindsided. I reacted really badly lashed on him since I felt betrayed, confused, and completely left out of such a big decision. We ended up having a huge fight. He told me I was being dramatic and unsupportive, and said he couldn’t continue the relationship. So he broke up with me.

But just before he left, he showed up at my doorstep and said he made a mistake everything happened last minute and he will do anything to make long-distance work. Alot was going for him wrt to his family and I believed him. I held onto that hope. But after he moved, things changed. He was thriving in his new life career, new city, new people, new friends, always travelling while I was struggling. He did put in the efforts but my work suffered (verge of getting fire because I could not focus) my plans to study abroad fell apart due to finances, and I felt lost. Not even once he touch-based the topic of how and when both of us would be together in future.

I had one super bad day at work and in a moment of frustration, I told him maybe we should end things because all of this was giving me anxiety attacks and I blocked him. It was impulsive. I was overwhelmed. And I regretted it.

It was 2022 and I couldn’t eat, sleep, or function properly for weeks. Eventually, he reached out just to check in. I broke down and asked if we could try again. He said he needed time to think and he once he will be visiting India we will fix things. So I waited. We weren’t in touch much because of time zones and busy schedules, and after three months, when we met in India he told me he liked someone there, and he has started living in with her and long-distance relationship would not work because he wants physical companionship in a new country. Hence it was over.

I had tears when he took out his phone and showed me his pictures with her. I got to know recently they are engaged now and I saw the picture. And it is like a dagger went down my chest and i know some hope is gone forever I know now that he’s never coming back to me, and not even to India.

It’s been 3 years. On the surface, I’m in a better place my career is stable, I’m financially secure, and emotionally, I’ve grown. I’ve tried dating. I know it was just a 1 year thing and I’ve tried letting go. But I am still in India in the same city and everything all the time just reminds me of him - coffee, a cafe, bookstore, movies, shopping places (i know stupid) while he conveniently moved on with his life. I have tried looking for jobs outside India so as to start afresh but nothing works out and now I am at an age where there is extreme pressure from my parents to get married. Now a part of me blames me so much wishing I should have been calm he was also navigating everything new.

Last month he reached out of nowhere saying he wants to speak one last time and really wants to make things better between us I clearly did set my boundary that he should never contact me again. And since then on I am spiralling and feeling like this.",8,1751878705.0,TwoXIndia,8,0.9,False

She insisted I wear open-toe sandals. I refused, saying it even specified in the interview that shoes of that kind weren’t allowed in the kitchen area. I was financially dependant on her and she threatened to cut me off if I ‘disobeyed’ her, plus I hadn’t yet learned to deal with her tantrums and fights, so I relented, even thought I knew it wouldn’t end well.

My interviewer took one look at me and refused to let me in the food preparation area. She refused to interview me, and cancelled the interview and sent me home. Needless to say, I got a rejection email later that day.

When I got home, my mother insisted the interview must been cancelled due to something I said or did, and refused to apologise. To this day, she still adamantly insists she did nothing wrong, and that it was my fault for having the interview cancelled.

My Green Eyed Lover,

This is the most important thing I’ve ever written. No filters. No bravado. Just truth, from the heart. A letter not from a man trying to win something, but from a man who already found everything when he found you.

When we first truly connected, not as friends, but as two aching hearts seeking quiet in a loud world it felt small at first. A moment. A snuggle. Just comfort between friends. But it wasn’t small. It was everything.  Those green eyes saw my soul that night and my blue eyes saw your soul that night! I didn’t know it then, but the moment you leaned into me, fully clothed, fully human, fully you!  You rewrote what peace meant to me. I had been through chaos, betrayal, false starts, and endings that pretended to be beginnings. But that night, with your breath near mine and your body gently pressed to my chest, my soul sighed for the first time in years. 
Also just to be 100% honest what happened the next morning, truly was an accident!  I remember thinking, oh my god I just??  You know the rest of the story, so I will leave it at that!  

We weren’t thinking of falling in love. We were healing. But in healing, we uncovered something purer than either of us expected, something rare. We didn’t choose it. It chose us and it was love! This is not completely true, when I left your house that morning, yes! I was in love with you!

Loving you has been the most real thing I’ve ever done. I had no idea unconditional love was something that could exist in my world, until you showed me. You showed me what unconditional love felt and looked like. You didn’t just love me, you saw me. And in return, I gave you the best love I knew how. I saw you and my god are you beautiful! I have never seen such Beaty, on the inside and absolutely the outside! I loved you unconditionally and without expectation, but I now see that even the deepest love can’t thrive without healing. And it wasn’t the love that failed, it was the unhealed parts of me that I hadn’t yet faced. That’s on me and I will forever be sorry for that!

Please hear this: I heard you. Every word you said. Every truth you offered, even the hard ones. And I didn’t let them pass. For the past four and a half months, I’ve been showing up twice a week, sitting with the mirror, letting my therapist walk with me through the wreckage and the reasons, the fears and the scars. I’m not doing this for a second chance. I’m doing it because you were the mirror that made me realize I had to change because I want to love the right way and I wanted to love you the right way! And because all I want, is for you to be proud to love me back.

You are not just any woman. You are the first woman I have ever truly, undeniably, and wholeheartedly loved. Not in a “forever sounds good” kind of way. But in the way that makes me certain!  Certain that I will marry you someday, if you allow me the honor? That if I die before you, my soul will stay with you, quietly holding your hand as you sleep. Because my love doesn’t end at death. It doesn’t even end at failure. It only deepens. It only begins again.

I promise on everything that matters to me, that if you choose to hand me your heart one more time, I will hold it like we both know it deserves to be held!  With kindness, softness, with certainty and with love! You will never hear my voice raised in anger, ever. Not once. The only thing that will separate me from you again will be my final breath. And even then, my love stays.

I want the life we almost had and so much more! With all seven of our children! With all the messy, imperfect, magical moments that come with blending souls and stories. To me, this is the perfect love. A perfect love, we both deserve! I want our love, unconditional love from both sides! I want the hard days, the belly laughs, the quiet mornings, the coffee in bed, the hand squeezes in the car, the hold you as you fall asleep, the forgiveness when we’re tired, the honesty when we’re scared, the deep knowing that we are no longer alone in this life.

This is not just my truth. This is me and you and it’s our truth. This is a chance to start new, with the communication we both desire and the love we both want. For you. God, for us. To what I know is the greatest love story ever told not because it’s flawless, but because it is absolutely real. And real love? It deserves to be fought for, it deserves to never be given up on, so it can rise. And sometimes, it deserves a second or third chance.

So here I am. All in. 100%. No armor, no ego, no games. Just me, healed and healing, loving and ready to be loved!

If even a piece of your heart still remembers what we felt, I’m here. I am already home. All that’s missing is you, my true love!

Forever and Always
Your Blue Eyed Love (S)

My neighbours came over and said they were putting up a waterside directly outside my house for all the kids on the estate, my daughter is 4 and obviously wanted to play so I apologised to my friend and went out with the neighbours to watch my daughter. We all ended up drinking and I had a bit too much. A bit of a backstory, my friend has severe social anxiety and despite my numerous asking for her to join she declined and just sat in the house.

When it came to her wanting to go home I said I dont think I could take her because I was really drunk and said she should get a taxi. My friend started kicking off and crying saying she didnt want to get a taxi. Long story short I ended up making a coffee and taking her home, left my daughter with the neighbours as if we were going to get in an accident I'd rather not have my daughter in the car. She never messaged me to ask if I got home safe.

The next day I text her asking if she was good and she said she didnt want to talk and I said ok ring me if you need me.

The day after that I tried ringing her, she didnt answer so I text and she responded with she was still upset from that day and feels like she needed to let the dust settle and didnt want to talk, so again long story cut short I basically responded with we were both adults and needed to talk this out, I understand why she was upset but she shouldn't of forced me to drive whilst drunk, that weve both done wrong and it doesnt just fall onto me, she responded that she didnt want to talk and shell talk when shes ready to.

Its been a week now and she still hasn't tried reaching out. This is my best friend of many years, my daughter calls her auntie, we never really get into arguments or anything and I genuinely couldn't imagine life without her. I understand what I did wrong and what should of happened that day was I should of took her home to moment my neighbours said they were doing that, its a lesson learnt for me.

1ltp3cg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ltp3cg/married_for_a_month_struggling_with_my_wifes_past/,Married for a Month – Struggling With My Wife’s Past and Transparency,"Hey everyone,

It’s been a month since I(M 28) got married. I started talking to my wife(F 27) just about five months ago — it’s an arranged marriage. In the beginning, she told me about her hobbies, interests, and what she likes to do. But she never really mentioned much about her past relationships — only briefly said that she had been in a relationship for a few months with a guy.

Before the wedding, we met a few times, and during one of those times (we were together for about a week), I happened to see some things on her phone that revealed more about her past. It wasn’t like I was snooping intentionally — it happened accidentally — but I found some old chats, photos, and details that she hadn’t shared with me.

Just a day before the wedding, she finally opened up a bit more about her past relationship. In the early days, she had mentioned that she was in a relationship with her ex for just 3 months. But later, I found out that the relationship actually lasted for about a year. Even after they broke up, they stayed in contact for nearly two more years — chatting regularly, going out for coffee, meeting in groups, and even having private meetings. Then, after he moved to a different city, she briefly dated someone else for about 5 weeks. A couple of months after that ended, she and I started talking.

What’s also been bothering me is seeing the photos and videos of her with her ex — doing various activities together, like sports and outings. She told me about her extend of relationship just one day before the marriage, which left me no real space to process or even say no. It felt like I was forced to accept it without being mentally or emotionally ready. And now, when I try to do those same activities with her — things like playing sports or going out — my mind keeps going back to what I saw and what she told me. It makes me feel sad and emotionally stuck.

It bothering me that not just the past itself, but the fact that she didn’t tell me earlier. I found out bits and pieces on my own, and then only later she filled in some gaps. I also believe that staying in contact with an ex — especially to this extent — is a red flag. I personally feel that once a relationship ends, it should end fully. Trying to stay friends usually leads to blurred lines and emotional entanglements.

Now, I’m struggling. These things are constantly on my mind, and I can’t stop overthinking. I feel hurt, sad, and a bit lost. It’s making it hard to fully connect with her in the present. She says she’s moved on, but my mind keeps going back.

I don’t want to be unfair or overly judgmental, but I also don’t want to ignore my gut feelings. I want to know:
Am I overreacting?
Is this something people work through and eventually get past in marriages?
Or are these genuine red flags I should be more cautious about?

Any advice or perspectives would really help. Thanks in advance.",0,1751878049.0,Marriage,0,0.5,False

I have proven and know the products and interests that will sell to my audience.

They are extremely active on FB, niche card game playing community of 55+ adults who:

* Enjoy card and game nights with friends and family
* Love fishing, gardening, and other hobbies
* Appreciate good food, coffee, and occasional gaming
* Are proud parents and grandparents

What we do a bit different is put the sponsors product in our weekly post that generates a great deal of customer engagement from the post. A few other different things we do along with FB ads.

* Increase brand awareness through targeted Facebook ads
* In post adverts, which has been proven to work better then FB ads
* A grassroots marketing approach, which also has proven to work and is a lost art along with contest giveaways and discounted product promos.

We feel this would work exceptionally well for a big company say like Bass Pro or Folgers coffee.  How does a small company A. get in touch with the correct person to make the pitch, and be it seems the larger companies are more interested in mass advertising, meaning lets find an influencer with 1M page views who cares the dem's then a page that has 100K views to a very specific niche active customers.  

On the flip a smaller business doesn't seem to understand that spending a small amount to a niche group may not generate mass amounts of sales but rather it is taking market share away from the mega corps along with brand awareness, new customer engagement, and slowly building a loyal customer base not just to a older generation but to their grandkids and kids.

I hope you’re having a good day.

I’m reaching out with a request I didn’t expect to have to make, but life has a way of throwing curveballs, doesn’t it?

I’ve been broke for a few months now, between prepping for the arrival of my first baby (due literally any day now) and becoming unemployed at the worst possible time (thanks job market)

To keep going in between life and the job search, I’ve been working through my backlog and living off Humble Bundle/Choice since they fit the tight budget well while every other spare penny goes to baby expenses and typical daily life/household bills.

And then, of course, Cyberpunk 2077 (with DLC) goes on sale for the lowest price I’ve ever seen on Steam, right when I can’t afford it and before it vanishes back to full price, probably until my child is old enough to start school given my current run of luck.

Here’s the situation:

- Currently between jobs, and the market is tougher than a Dark Souls boss fight.
- Won’t have funds before the sale ends, and who knows when it’ll be this low again.
- Any funds I do get are locked in for baby supplies and bills.
- Baby is due literally this week or next, so all spare cash is set aside for nappies and emergency chocolate for the wife.

Why Cyberpunk?

I love the genre, Keanu Reeves is a personal hero, I adored CDPR’s previous work, and I need a meaty, immersive game that’s easy to pick up and put down in between nappy changes and broken sleep. It would be nice to have a slice of Night City to escape to at 3 AM when I’m up for a feed or trying to get the little one to settle.

Most of the games I play come from bundles since that’s what I can afford, and it’s rare for me to buy directly on Steam unless it’s heavily discounted or gifted. Cyberpunk has been on and off my wishlist for ages, and this is the first time it’s realistically within reach.

If you’re in a position to help, it would genuinely make my day and give me something to look forward to during the chaos of the weeks ahead. If not, thank you for taking the time to read, and I hope your summer is filled with good games, good coffee and hopefully plenty of joy in between.

Coffee is something that is very close to my heart (as I am sure it is to yours too). From using it to stay awake at night to finish studying for the school exam the next day, to drinking it while smoking a cig in the college days, to drinking it in the morning to fuel the engines to survive at work.

Finally, I have decided to consummate my relationship with coffee and open a company. I want to make something which is affordable - so that every Indian (at least most of us) can enjoy great coffee without having to think twice before adding it to the week's ration list.

I think there are two kind of consumers of coffee in India. The first is the people who love drinking it everyday but don't think too much of it. It's either with milk, or black and that's it. The second are the connoisseurs.

**As a consumer, regardless of what bucket you fall into - I'd love to know what currently pains you about coffee in India today. Could be price point, could be quality, could be the beans, the powder, a particular product you wish existed, or was cheaper. If there's nothing that pains you, what do you wish existed, or wish was cheaper? Can be ANYTHING!**

I am not even sure if this is the correct place to ask this, I've had a reddit account for over 10 years now but have hardly used it. Never too late I guess, and thank you in advance.

But after a series of events that have hit nerve after nerve, I’d honestly just appreciate some help with any of this madness

So starting from the start,
I'm a 32-year-old techie, living abroad with my 32-year-old lovely wife and our twin sons, aged 3. Trying to get my life together, working from home amidst the chaos of raising twin boys.

My lovely wife has recently started working again after pregnancy. She’s balancing work, the kids, and may be overwhelmed. Lately, she’s been telling me I’ve changed since *her* pregnancy. That I don’t give her time anymore. That I’m not emotionally available the way I used to be. That there’s an emotional gap between us now.

Ofc, how would I give her time, when all of mine is already consumed in the kitchen cooking full-course meals twice daily, doing all the kitchen chores, and juggling a full-time WFH job.

Meanwhile, my lovely wife doesn’t lift a finger for anything outside her job. When the nanny isn’t around, she spends time with the kids plays with them, sips her coffee, unwinds, and  does some house work only when her ADHD diagnosed mind would want to. She does chores but then blames me that I'm behaving like perfectionist and everything cannot be perfectly done.

She has taken the duty to be with kids but she’s such a clingy mother. She sticks to the kids all the time and won't even give them space to breathe. They can’t even learn to play by themselves, because Mumma is always there coddling them. I see our sons turning into full-fledged Mumma’s boys with no sense of independence.  

She thinks I’m too critical of the kids. That I need to practice “gentle parenting” with two already-spoilt brats who throw tantrums like their mom. She wants me to be soft and emotionally available dad lol. 

She believes I’m the one creating an emotional distance in the marriage. That I’m not communicating well.  I’m making a mountain out of a molehill. Because somehow, her total under-involvement in day-to-day chores has never been seen as a problem and my efforts never get acknowledged 

And even after all this she still thinks I’m the one who's being unreasonable. We had a full blown fight recently and now she isn't talking to me properly. 

I feel like I married to any Indian MIL whose only work is to pamper her grandson and nit picks her DIL

Basically posting for accountability and to hear others experiences. If my writing seems off it is because I am dead tired and english is my second language.

I've had anxiety for years, since I was a kid. I'm probably predisposed to anxiety since it began before any caffeine or other drugs. 

Anyways I began drinking coffee when I was 12. Didn't know about the dangers at all, just though it was a grown-up thing that looked cool. Later I used it extensively to study better and later became extremely addicted because of work. 

I also used nicotine pouches after I turned 18, have spent the last years on and off but have seemed to finally kick it. When I was using those and caffeine my anxiety was almost debilitating. 

Seems obvious in hindsight that a lot of my anxiety probably comes from caffeine and especially my excessive use of it. Filling an anxious person with a stimulant every day is pretty stupid when I take a step back. 

I also hope this can help me kick my other addictions, like binge eating and porn. I've heard some say that caffeine makes other addictions stronger, so I'm hoping quitting caffeine can make quitting those easier. Even if quitting caffeine doesn't directly regulate my dopamine receptors, less anxiety and better sleep will help. My addictions are mainly used to self-sooth so less anxiety will make them less appealing.

Sleep is also a big one. I've tried setting a sleep schedule but I just can't go to sleep. It got so bad that my doctor prescribed me 25mg of quietiapine which I use only when I really can't sleep. Antipsychotics mess with your brain so I want to get off them completely. Also poor sleep leads to more caffeine which gives me more anxiety and less sleep, thus more caffeine the next day and you all know the cycle. 

I'm preparing for withdrawals the next few days, this is day one and I slept for like 5 hours (probably because I drank a bunch of coffee yesterday). I have work tomorrow so hope I sleep okay today and I have paracetamol in case I get the infamous headaches. Time to quit drinking stress every day.",3,1751876362.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

Why you should leave:

Cons:
Constant fighting. Zero accountability.
Hard to get her to say sorry. Disrespect.
Crossing boundaries. Doing things on purpose that she knew annoyed me. Being petty.
Always having to comfort her depression and validate her feelings.
Belittling my feelings and making it all about her.
Using my porn addiction against me in arguments, even though it's a sensitive topic.
Never asking how I’m doing. It’s always her, her, her.

Pros:
She’s funny. We play together and have stupid fun, even though I’ve always had that with other people too.
The sex is good, though it usually is regardless, since I’m the active one.
She’s beautiful, I mean very, but it isn’t enough.
Physical attraction is there, or not. I’m confused.

Everything just fucking sucks.
I feel like shit. I feel like an asshole.
I can’t fake being with her anymore. It’s draining. Everything is draining.

I love Amendail (the cat), but he’s so fucking annoying sometimes. Constant clinginess and playing, even though he’s very affectionate. I do have fun with him, but he can drive me crazy.

I feel like I’m drowning in my own abyss.
As someone said in one of the comments:
“Don’t burn yourself to keep someone else warm.”
I feel like I’m losing myself. I feel lost. I feel miserable.

Is it normal to feel this way?
Am I crazy?
Do I need therapy?
Probably.

I have no one in my life besides my mom.
I can’t trust people.
I guess it’s from childhood trauma. I don’t know.

You cannot stay. You can’t.

You feel like a mess?
You’re scared to move apartments? Is it because of money?
Don’t you value your own sanity?

Even better: Do you even want to be with her?

Too many things to consider, but I feel it’s not worth it at all.
I feel numb.

“The lemon isn’t worth the squeeze.”
Stupid saying, haha, but it’s a good one.

Fear of her sleeping with other men:
It’s a bad feeling but a necessary one.
Remember how you always thought about this in past relationships?
It passed.
So will this.

Why do I even feel unsatisfied in relationships?
Is it to fill the void inside myself? I’m not sure.
Probably is.

I fucking hate writing this.
It’s annoying honestly, but I need to let it out.

Her goddamn birthday is soon.
And her mom is sick.
I feel like a fucking asshole for breaking up.

But should I break up?
Yes. It’s necessary.
For your own sanity.
For your own peace of mind.

Remember how you came to the big city to have a new chapter, alone?
Single?
Did you have doubts or depression?
You don’t remember any.
There was zero drama.
Your own place.
It was peaceful.


---

Dude, I’m fucking scared shitless.

Will she be violent?
Will she understand?
Will she cry?

What about my pain?

As someone said:
“You cannot zero your own pain for hers.”

You cannot satisfy her needs if yours aren’t being met.
I feel incomplete inside.
I feel like relationships are too hard for me.

But why?

Why can’t I fathom the idea of someone loving me and me loving them back?

I felt disrespected and shattered, multiple times.
Remember when you were crying late at night?
Alone?

Is that how a relationship is supposed to feel?
I don’t know.

Day 2:

I broke up with my girlfriend.
She cried.
It was weird.

It’s not like I wanted her to cry or be sad, but I feel nothing.

I mean, I was sad to break up with her because her birthday is soon and the thing with her mom, but I don’t feel sad for us.

Is this normal?
Or like someone said, maybe it hasn’t hit me yet.

Yet my brain is typing this. Kind of funny.
It’s kind of weird.
I remember our memories, but I mostly remember the bad ones.
I don’t understand why.

Right now I’m drinking coffee, feeling nothing toward her.

Should I be prepared for some of her pettiness?
To see her all dressed up?
Going on dates?

Do I even care anymore?

And her perfume is too sweet.
It kind of makes me a bit sick.
