1i8u25s,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlairEspresso/comments/1i8u25s/workflow_experiments_homemade_blind_shaker_cup/,"Workflow experiments: homemade blind shaker (cup + lid), no WDT","Hi all!

I wanted to share my blind shaker experiments.
I was on the verge of buying a shaker and decided to try the workflow out first with what I had at home.
I just put a lid on my grinder's cup, shook it up, dumped into the basket, tapped, tamped, and done.

Surprise surprise, this works better than my elaborate WDT dance routine xD
Using this I never get any channelling, versus minor channelling in ~25% of my WDT shots. However, it did change the taste, my shots are more acid (which I don't like) with the shaker. I corrected this by grinding finer and have found my perfect tasting shots again.

So I will not buy a gadget to do what an old cup & a lid do just fine. I'll be using this method for the time being, I'll report back if I stumble on any new findings.
I made a video of the process in case some of this was not clear, but really all I'm trying to say is that the blind shaker method works better than WDT for me, without expensive gadgets.

20.5g of coffee in the basket for 42g of coffee in the cup.

1i8u0jb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1i8u0jb/thailand_beginner_itinerary_feedback/,Thailand Beginner Itinerary Feedback,"Hi everyone!

I‚Äôm planning my first trip to Thailand this April and would love some feedback on the itinerary I‚Äôve put together. I‚Äôm feeling pretty confident about the first leg of the trip but am torn about the second half, and I could use some advice from seasoned travellers.

# Planned Itinerary (First Leg):

1. **Bangkok (3 Nights)**: Exploring temples, markets, and enjoying some rooftop bars. This leg feels solid, and I‚Äôm excited to dive into the culture and vibrant city vibes.
2. **Chiang Mai (3 Nights)**: Planning to experience Songkran Festival (April 13), visit an ethical elephant sanctuary, and check out the temples and Old City.
3. **Krabi (4 Nights, Ao Nang)**: Focusing on activities like the Four Islands Tour, a trip to Railay Beach, and exploring the Emerald Pool and Tiger Cave Temple.

# The Dilemma: Khao Lak vs. Koh Tao

For the last segment of the trip (3 nights), I‚Äôm torn between staying in **Khao Lak** or making the effort to travel to **Koh Tao**:

# Option 1: Khao Lak

* My plan here would be to use Khao Lak as a base for:
   * A day trip to **Khao Sok National Park** (Cheow Lan Lake).
   * A snorkelling trip to the **Similan Islands**.
* It‚Äôs much easier logistically from Krabi (just a \~2.5-hour drive). I can then head to Phuket for my flight back to Bangkok.

# Option 2: Koh Tao

* I‚Äôd love to spend a few days on Koh Tao because the vibe seems more aligned with what I enjoy‚Äîwalking around, finding cool coffee shops, and sipping a cocktail while watching the sunset.
* BUT‚Ä¶ getting there is a hassle:
   * It would require a flight or long transfer to Surat Thani, followed by a ferry (\~6-8 hours total).
   * Leaving Koh Tao for Bangkok would also be time-consuming (ferry + flight), meaning I‚Äôd lose 1-2 days of the trip.
   * It's also much more expensive to fly to Bangkok from Koh Samui than it is from Sarut Thani, Krabi or Phuket (3-4x the price).
   * I‚Äôd likely have to skip **Khao Sok National Park**, which I‚Äôm keen to visit.

# Alternative Idea: Island Stay in Krabi?

If I decide against Koh Tao, I‚Äôm considering spending a night on an island while in Krabi‚Äîmaybe Railay Beach, Koh Phi Phi (non-party areas), or Hong Island. My vibe is super chill: I love sunsets, cocktails, and relaxing music. I *despise* party scenes like Magaluf or the Ibiza strip, so I‚Äôm looking for something quieter and more serene but still a nice atmosphere.

# Questions for You:

1. **Khao Lak vs. Koh Tao:** Which would you recommend based on my itinerary and vibe? Is Koh Tao worth the logistical hassle, or does Khao Lak offer enough for a fulfilling end to my trip?
2. **Island Stay in Krabi:** Is it worth spending a night on an island like Railay Beach or Koh Phi Phi to make up for skipping Koh Tao? Are there quieter areas that fit my vibe?
3. **Any Other Suggestions?** If there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm missing that would balance this trip better, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!",1,1737720860.0,ThailandTourism,0,1.0,False

I'm 9 weeks post partum, and wake up like clock work at 5 am now. I'm all in my thoughts, and reflecting on so much. I was thinking back to when my mom was alive, I had so many friends and I was sociable. Since she passed 4 years ago, I have found that i've isolated myself, pushed people away, or have had no interest in making friends. When my mom was diagnosed, I found people would say the most insensitive things like ""it could be worse"" ""she wont suffer anymore soon"" ""dont be so negative."" All of these phrases slowly but surely caused me to feel like I was on my own island and can't relate to anyone any longer. Now here I am with a new baby. No mom. No friends. & extremely limited family support. I ask myself how I got here, and the answer is sadly losing my mom. It touched so many aspects of my life, that sometimes I don't recognize who I used to be, and it scares me. Anyways, if you read this, thanks.

I used to hate myself n my life alot back then.

But I miss the feeling of peace because of free mind from all the worries of tomorrow I had in my childhood.
That feeling is what I am hungry for and that can be now only be achieved by becoming rich.
So this the primary reason I have my FIRE Goals and I just keep thinking about it 24x7. But Now am on that path I can feel the peace. And as time passes I am getting more peacful and even tht FIRE is slowing little by little.

I am not sure why and how at the age of 27 or so I suddenly became so wise and mature.
I got engaged at 17, married at 18 became independant at 21 and father at 23.
And may be because of my constant thinking all my teenage years went into struggle of becoming self independant and financially stable while I see the kids around my age really grinding in their career & growing, having a great social life n all. And I was juggling my married life, dads life with peer pressure I always kept of thinking on how I can get my FIRE to start living my life peacefully without any worry. I wanted to give best to my wife, son n my family.

I was always a smart kid though who would score nice without any effort in my academics but the problem was I had no vision of what to become in life careerwise so the most important years of my  intelligence got wasted without any vision. Because the people in my life that time were also living their life without vision and had least of GK.
I had no1 to guide me into right thing.

In my environment, while growing and also in my teenage life what I observed that people were very weak and were living their life in ignorance.
They wud lie without thinking and/or need, wud manipulate other ppl, wud try to take advantage at every moment, wud constantly hate, blame and get jealous of other ppl success or money.

Very few ppl I saw in my life who posses great intelligence, responsibility, character, and actual honesty/ loyality and vision. Like 1 or 2.
Everybody else was just passing time working without any vision and blaming others n life at every challenge they face.

This observation led my mind in building my intelligence and character of these great men I always got wowed from and wanted to be like one of them.

I started reading a lot...day n night not just anything but everything then in my mind I wud filter out the nonsense and record the things I was always looking for. I used to consume from internet all sort of stuffs like religious, non religious, fictional non fictional etc, scientific, life stories, etc...

Slowly slowly my mind started into just manifesting the right things. The things I always wanted.
Days passed I started loving myself and enjoying my own company.
Now I have lost interest in social life which was already very little in my teenage because of responsibilities. I have lost interest in almost everything. I have lost interest in ppl. I have lost interest in watching any TV or movie. I dont go  trips. I have no friend whatsoever. I dont feel like talking to my family (mom,dad, brothers).
And my current role which is WFH from last 6 years is like a dream job for me not leaving it even for 100% hike.



Today My daily routine is:

Wake up at 7:30am

Football 8 to 9am

Bathing and liqiud, medicines (kidney stone) 9 to 10am

Reading 10 to 11am

Lunch 11 to 11:30am plus TMKC

Reading 11:30 to 12:30am

12:30 to 2pm nap after dropping kid to school

2:30 to 10:30pm office time ( working+reading+getting kid from school n dropping him to dance class)

Coffee at 4:30pm

Dinner at 7pm.

Reading 11pm to 12am.

Sleep at arounf 12am

All day I drink 3-4 litres of water n go to toilet 6-7 times.



This is my routine from last 3 years and going on.

Have watched 2 movies in last 6 years.
No FB no Insta no Social Media apart from reddit.
Have gone to 2 family trips in last 6 years.
Infact I was hospitalised 5 times in last 6 years.
Never made a new friend from last 10 or 12 years.
Never hanged out with friend from last 15 years.
The last trip I made with my friends was Imagica like before 15 years or something when I was not even married. Now am 32


I was super active but now I dont do anything.
I have gym membership which is 2 min walk but still i dont go. I am fit though.

All I do is just play football, read and work!

I started loving my loneliness it just does not bother me to stay alone all day infact I feel at peace when am alone. I dont even like to show my face in business meeting and whatsapp video calls from family n all. I just am very very at peace alone.

I even went to a psychiatrist he said as long as u feel good this is ok.

For example, imagine doing a¬†cheating roleplay¬†with characters from¬†Khabhi Khushi Khabhi Gham. The slutty Pooh (Kareena Kapoor) constantly pushing her limits, always small satin robes or sheer robes and nothing else, the ends of the robe stopping at her mid-thigh, the loosely tied belt the only thing protecting her from flashing. Even though her exposed waist and cleavage told a story of their own, her nipples barely hidden and did slip out every few seconds.

Or Andhadhun, When Simi had to test if Akash was really blind she came to his house to investigate and while he was making coffee, she pulled out her massive breasts in the kitchen to see what visible reaction he would have or maybe down in his pants?

or how about a in-universe sequel to Humraaz?

Following the steps of other successful choreographers before him (Farah Khan, Prabhu Deva, Ganesh Acharya, etc) - now Omi has plans to turn into a director and take the responsibility for an entire film.

Raj Singhania (41) has occasionally financed a few films done by his friends. So he is known in the producers-directors circle. One of Omi‚Äôs acquaintances helps in setting up a meeting between Omi and Raj. The men meet.

Omi tells Raj, that he wants to make a movie about a married woman, without her knowledge. The woman will be someone who has a dancing background, but has been away from the dancing world for years. Raj is intrigued by the idea, and decides to fund this movie. And asks him, whom Omi wanna cast in the movie.

Omi drops a bomb, and shows Raj a short film. It‚Äôs shot with hidden camera, and features Priya (36) - Raj‚Äôs wife. It‚Äôs a film where Priya is dancing in a wedding baraat, and bumps into Omi. The two dance happily. Raj is pretty impressed with the way, Omi has used the camera, edit and music. And also, he likes the idea of his wife returning to something dance/entertainment related field. He gives green signal.

Omi and his brother Karan had a ten year age gap, so after their parents death - Karan had practically been like a parent to him. Omi as a ten year old, was pretty fond of Priya (who back then, was his Bhaiya‚Äôs girlfriend). Omi used to constantly day dream about living a perfect life with Karan and Priya. Until one day - everything was over!

As he grew up in this harsh world, he found what had happened to his brother. And how Priya was now living a luxurious life. He would often feel his brother inside his mind, and would want to take Priya for himself. In his head, that would unite Priya and Karan. He started learning to dance, his brother‚Äôs old videos and memories helped him a lot. And the hatred for Priya and Raj just fuelled his passion.

Meanwhile Raj Singhania is going through a crisis. He has been not able to get his rod hard for any woman since years now. He loves his wife truly, and he knows that she loves him too. But the lack of sex is eating him up. There was no excitement or color in his life. Until Omi walked into his office with that short film‚Ä¶

When Raj saw Omi (a young guy) dancing with his wife. He felt a current flowing through his body. He felt hard for the first time in years. He saw how Omi‚Äôs hands had brushed against the naked skin of Priya‚Äôs back and waist. How her giant melons had crushed on Omi‚Äôs chest a couple of times. He wanted more‚Ä¶

*  ‚Äå **Safety:**  Safety should be the utmost priority.  Avoid toys with small parts that could be a‚Å¢ choking hazard ‚Å§and opt for non-toxic materials. ‚Äç The search ‚Äãfor *safe chew toys for puppies* is ‚Å§a ‚Äãtop‚Äç concern,and we'll be highlighting ‚Å§toys that prioritize this.

*‚Å¢   **Enrichment:**  Chewing should also be ‚Å£stimulating.

Maybe typing it will make it feel less like a secret slowly suffocating me.

Every morning, I wake up and feel the weight first. It‚Äôs not the kind of exhaustion sleep fixes. It‚Äôs heavier, like my bones are filled with cement and my chest is wrapped in barbed wire. I go through the motions‚Äîwork, chores, small talk‚Äîbut it all feels like I‚Äôm acting in a play where everyone else has the script except me. I smile. I nod. I say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù And no one questions it.

The truth? I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore.

But I stay.

Because of them.

My parents are in their late 70s now. My dad still tends to his rose garden every weekend, cursing at squirrels for digging up his precious blooms. My mom hums old Motown songs while she cooks, even though her hands shake a little these days. They‚Äôre good people. The kind who worked three jobs between them to keep a roof over my head, who still text me ‚Äúgoodnight, sweetheart‚Äù every single evening without fail. They don‚Äôt know how often I stare at that text and cry.

I can‚Äôt do it to them. I can‚Äôt let their final years be defined by the grief of losing a child. They‚Äôve already buried siblings, friends, a lifetime of struggles. How could I add myself to that list? When my mom‚Äôs eyes light up telling stories about my kindergarten ‚Äúart career,‚Äù or my dad slips me a $20 ‚Äúfor coffee‚Äù even though I‚Äôm 35, I‚Äôm reminded that my existence still matters to¬†*someone*. So I hold on. For now.

But I‚Äôm terrified of what comes after. When they‚Äôre gone, who will I be staying for? My friends have their own families. My siblings are scattered across the country. I‚Äôve become a ghost in my own life, hovering on the edges, too numb to connect. I don‚Äôt know how to rebuild from that.

Some days, I resent them for loving me so much. It sounds horrible, but it‚Äôs the truth. If they were colder, crueler, maybe this would be easier. But they‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ parents. Flawed, aging, relentlessly kind parents who don‚Äôt deserve the bomb I‚Äôd drop on their world.

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this. Maybe I just need to scream into the void. Maybe I want someone to say, ‚ÄúI get it,‚Äù even if they can‚Äôt fix it. Or maybe I‚Äôm hoping that by admitting this, I‚Äôll find one more thread to grip when the cement in my bones starts pulling me under.

If you‚Äôve read this far, thank you. Sometimes just being seen feels like a reason to last another day.",1,1737718616.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

Quick back story. I (m36) have two beautiful boys with me ex partner (f30). We‚Äôve been seperated for 4 years, I‚Äôve been with my current partner (f34) for 3 years. 

As a lot of seperated parents will know, it was absolute chaos, and a lot of pain to get to where we are now. 50/50 for the most part. The boys‚Äô mum, is pretty unreliable, changing pick up/drop off times every single week, some times even the date changes depending on whats going on.. but it‚Äôs not about that.

School holidays have been never ending, with expensive vacation care and days off work. 

My kids love my partner, she seems to love them too.. 
we spend a lot of time together, the 4 of us.

She‚Äôs had a couple of free days after Christmas, so has offered to watch the boys, which they‚Äôre happy to do and she‚Äôs been a great help taking a day here and there, for the days I‚Äôm responsible for them.

Today has been the last day of care during the week and my partner has looked after the kids while I worked. 

She stressed that the boys had been very off, stranger than normal at hand over.. and have been causing trouble all day.. I offered for her to drop them to work with me, I can accommodate at work. It‚Äôs just not ideal for them, I‚Äôd rather them at home if possible. She declined. 

I come home this afternoon, grab the boys and take them over to the pool for a couple of hours. My partners friend was round having a glass of wine, so thought to let them catch up while I spend time with the kids. 

Her friend leaves, my partner has had a couple of glasses of wine. (The wine, for me, is becoming a problem.. it‚Äôs been more frequent of late, and she can get quite drunk, I barely drink)

She starts to talk to me about her day, about the boys and how have they been. She starts to get quite upset. 

She talks to me about a conversation between herself and my oldest, about how he‚Äôs been ‚Äòtold‚Äô to tell her, that she‚Äôs just a stepmom, and can‚Äôt tell him what to do‚Ä¶ which has came from the mum/or the grandmother.. She proceeds to tell me, that she recorded a conversation today, between herself and my oldest boy.. to show me what he‚Äôs like when I‚Äôm not there.. 

Which I thought was quite strange.. as if for evidence? 

She then, goes on to tell me, that while we were playing, she went through my oldest sons‚Äô iPad, and read messages between him and his mum.. infront of her friend. And spoke about it with said friend, at length. about her, and not the nicest kind of messages. (I told her mum, I told her what you wanted me to say. Told her she‚Äôs just a stepmom and doesn‚Äôt get to tell me what to do.) 

Now, I‚Äôm not a massive fan of their mother. She‚Äôs been pretty unreal about the whole break up and care and girlfriends etc.. there‚Äôs been a lot go on, I was struggling at one point, not being able to see the boys. But anyways, I‚Äôm passed it, life is good, and I‚Äôve learned the hard way, about not holding grudges, not letting people surprise me anymore, and actually letting things go.

My partner has grew a massive hate for my ex, to the point I try to avoid conversations about her, as it leads down a rabbit hole and it‚Äôs hard to get her out of it. You put your dick in her, how did you have kids with such an awful person? All that carry on, which I find pretty childish. I try to laugh it off, she knew I had kids when I met her.

Now, I understand that these messages may not have been nice, even now after 4 years. And I know that it‚Äôs coming from a very dark, unmaternal place.. but, the ex will parent how she sees fit, I don‚Äôt agree with it, and I do hope the boys see it for what it really is when they‚Äôre older. But I‚Äôll never say a bad word to my kids, about their mother, or my partner. I will never be that guy. 

But, recording a conversation.. without my kids knowledge? Seems wild‚Ä¶ but then telling me that she‚Äôs went through his messages? To his mum.. whether good bad or ugly, are private!! I don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs 8 he has contact with his mum, as much as he has contact with me.. but also went through these messages, with her friend, who we see twice a year? To me.. is absolutely out of order? 

Now my partner is quite drunk, I sat and listened, and I agree.. what his mother is doing is not good parenting, I believe the way she is with my oldest is quite unhealthy, I‚Äôve mentioned it a few times, but get the normal, angry responses. But yeah, I tried to explain that it is going to happen sometimes, his mum is going to bad mouth us directly to him. But I tried to put the conversation off until tomorrow, when she‚Äôs sober. She wouldn‚Äôt have it, followed me around the house, raising her voice, infront of the kids. I asked her to stop maybe 15 times.. got told to fuck off, fuck all of you. Won‚Äôt watch the kids anymore, hates the ex, hates that I defend her. Really lost her temper with me, when all i asked, was that we cut it and continue on in the morning after a coffee.. 

What do I do here? I very nearly asked her to leave.. the way she went in at me, was nuts.. I understand why she is angry, but I can‚Äôt ignore the recording and going through messages? I‚Äôm currently writing this, on the couch. Kids are safe asleep, and she‚Äôs upstairs, sending me messages, going on with the same conversation. When I‚Äôve clearly asked her to stop‚Ä¶ any help would be appreciated. Thanks ",1,1737717852.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I'm sure she'll get in she's smart as fuck and her accomplishments so far are just amazing.

She wants to celebrate her birthday soon so I thought it would be nice to put a gift card for a coffee shop near her future university (Griffith University) in.

Does anyone know any chain in that area that's a) not terrible and b) sells downloadable gift cards?

I'm from Germany so physical gift cards won't do.
From google-ing so far I've only found coffee club that seemed kinda wide spread and nice but they don't offer digital cards.

(I also got her an assortment of teas, here in Germany teas always have cringey names like 'inner calm' or 'stressfree' - I thought those calm down messeges and the gift card would bring my sentiment of ""don't worry you've got this"" across quite well)

But when I bought darker blue curtains, it was very ugly. Like, overwhelmingly dark.

I'm looking for a colour curtain that complements the room, but I also wouldn't be opposed to changing the wall colour or even have multi coloured walls. I also want to add a round carpet underneath the coffee table, but I'm afraid It'll look very cluttered.

Mostly I'm looking for ideas and inspiration, and have it not look so boring. Wall decorations will be bought later, also don't mind the other room.

I find it overwhelming and too much pressure. Nobody in my life understands or cares about my feeling like this, and so every year as much as I insist I don't want anything, or to donate to charity in my name if they simply must lighten their wallets in my honour, everyone ignores this and spends money on something I then feel obliged to display gratitude for. If it's a physical gift I'll usually end up giving it away if I can, but sometimes it's some experience that I have to persevere through to make whoever gave it happy.

Yesterday was my birthday. I thought my GF (40F) and I had agreed no gifts, but of course I was wrong. On paper it was a great gift for me, a better version of something I use regularly already. I thanked her, berated her for giving gifts when I said not to, but otherwise we got on with the day - walking the dog, going out for coffee and then a quiet lunch at a place I chose and paid for (I insisted), then back home to chill and play video games and eat snacks. Other than the gift bit, the perfect birthday for me.

Today I wanted to show I was grateful for the gift so I started trying to use it. After a few minutes I couldn't see how it would actually be better than what I do already. Here's where I think IATA - my GF came into the room and I said all this out loud. She said if I didn't like it I didn't have to use it. At this point I was just overwhelmed and burst into tears, and said I didn't want to be ungrateful but if she could return it and get her money back that would make me feel better. She said she'd try. I kept apologising and saying I was grateful for the thought and the effort but that it was just wasted on me, she kept saying it was ok but I could tell she was disappointed. I felt and still feel awful about it. We have been together 5 years, this is the first time I've reacted like this but she does know that this is generally how I feel.

We're going out to a show tonight with my friends - another gift I'd rather not have received - and of course I'll go because it's what people want, but my god I feel like such an ungrateful bitch. I get that it's a stupid thing to be upset about, but I am. And I'm going to be expected to have fun because it's my birthday, but I'm just not going to be in the mood. AITA?

1i8sto0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_designprotechs/comments/1i8sto0/8_reasons_art_lovers_prefer_buying_paintings/,8 Reasons Art Lovers Prefer Buying Paintings Online,"In recent years, the art world has seen a significant shift towards online platforms for purchasing paintings. Art lovers are increasingly choosing to¬†[buy artwork](https://paintingsbytaran.com/)¬†from the comfort of their own homes rather than visiting galleries or art fairs. This trend is not merely a consequence of convenience but is driven by several compelling reasons that enhance the overall experience of acquiring art.

# 1. Convenience and Accessibility

One of the most significant advantages of buying paintings online is the convenience it offers. Art lovers can browse extensive collections at any time, whether they‚Äôre sipping coffee in their living room or on a lunch break at work. Online galleries and platforms provide access to a vast array of styles, genres, and artists, making it easy to find something that resonates with individual tastes. This accessibility is particularly beneficial for those living in areas with limited local art options.

# 2. Diverse Selection

Online platforms often showcase a broader range of artists and styles than traditional galleries. Buyers can discover emerging artists alongside established names, providing a more comprehensive view of the art landscape. This diversity allows art lovers to explore various mediums, from abstract paintings to realistic landscapes, all in one place. Having such a wide selection can inspire collectors to branch out and experiment with styles they might not have considered before.

# 3. Detailed Information and Transparency

When purchasing art online, buyers typically have access to detailed information about each piece, including the artist‚Äôs background, techniques used, and the story behind the artwork. This transparency helps buyers make informed decisions and fosters a deeper connection with the art. Many online platforms also provide high-resolution images, allowing potential buyers to see intricate details and textures that may not be visible in person.

# 4. Price Comparisons and Budget Control

Shopping online allows art lovers to compare prices easily across different platforms. This ability to research and find the best deals empowers buyers to make purchases that fit their budgets. Many online galleries also offer a range of price points, making it easier to find affordable options without compromising on quality. This democratization of art allows more people to invest in original works, broadening the audience for art in general.

# 5. Comfort and Privacy

Buying art can be an intimate experience, and many people prefer the privacy of shopping online. In a physical gallery, the presence of sales personnel can sometimes create pressure, making it challenging for buyers to explore freely. Online shopping eliminates this pressure, allowing individuals to take their time to browse, reflect, and make decisions without feeling rushed. This comfort can lead to more thoughtful purchases that genuinely resonate with the buyer.

# 6. Direct Artist Engagement

Many online platforms facilitate direct communication between buyers and artists. This engagement allows art lovers to ask questions, request custom pieces, or even discuss the inspiration behind a work. Building a relationship with the artist can enhance the emotional connection to the piece and provide a more personalized purchasing experience. This direct line of communication is often lacking in traditional gallery settings, where buyers may only interact with sales staff.

# 7. Custom and Commission Options

Another appealing aspect of purchasing art online is the option for custom commissions. Many artists are open to creating bespoke pieces tailored to the buyer‚Äôs specifications. This flexibility allows art lovers to acquire unique works that perfectly match their vision, making the piece even more special. Whether it‚Äôs a specific color palette, size, or theme, commissioning art online opens up new avenues for personalization.

# 8. Community and Inspiration

Online art communities and platforms often provide a space for art lovers to connect, share ideas, and inspire one another. Many websites feature blogs, forums, and social media channels where buyers can engage with fellow art enthusiasts. This sense of community enriches the experience of purchasing art and fosters a deeper appreciation for the craft.

In conclusion, the preference for buying paintings online is driven by convenience, diversity, transparency, and the opportunity for personal engagement with artists. These factors create an inviting and enriching experience for art lovers, making it easier than ever to find and acquire meaningful artwork.

I'm trying to set up a couple of batch files for work to mass copy a specific set of files within folders mixed with files we don't want to copy. I haven't played with a batch file in 20 years and I think I'm running off a slightly outdated guide here because it's just not quite doing what I want it to do...

To get what I needed for these, I had to export the specific tables from the database, isolate the Filename, and Date Created, then create an XCOPY string with the file path and file name, mass copy paste yay thanks Excel. Issues as advertised below.



Batch A: pull specific files from date-stamped folders, copy the existing folder structure and filename but paste to specific location.

\- For this, I'm using:

XCOPY ""source\\file"" ""destination\\file"" /S /E /Y

\--- From here, it's prompting every file asking if it's a file or folder at the destination, and that's cool, there's no modifier in my command for that. 

After running a '/?', I saw that adding '/-I' should fix my issue here by telling the XCOPY command to assume the copied file is in fact, a file, rather than a folder. But upon running the batch again, it doesn't recognize '/-I' as a valid argument and skips to the next file, which it asks again if it's a file or folder.

  
I'm wanting to just have it copy the source to destination, creating and folders and subfolders it needs along the way, without being prompted to confirm if the file is a file.

  
  
For the next one....

  
Batch B: copy entire folders from specific location, excluding unwanted folders within the same location (think, scanned documents relating to specific individuals, and everyone has their own folder).

  
Similar to the above, my guide basically said to use: 

XCOPY ""source\\"" ""destination\\"" /S /E

  
Unlike the other, instead of getting confirmation messages, I'm just getting ""file not found"" because it's looking for a file rather than trying to copy the entire folder like I want. I wasn't able to see a command modifier that might help me here so I'm thinking I might just need a different command but I'm too out of practice to work this one out at 10pm on a Friday night.



I'm really hoping to have a fix for this one by next weekend otherwise some poor sod will have to sit there hitting ""F"" for 70,000 files, then manually copy the 10,000 folders needed for ""B""

1i8sr1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blogging/comments/1i8sr1j/some_truths_about_blogging/,Some truths about blogging,"I started blogging in 2022 after nearly a decade of working in digital marketing, specifically in SEO. Over these years, I‚Äôve heard countless opinions about blogging‚Äîwhat it is, what it isn‚Äôt, and everything in between. Recently, I had an interesting conversation with a friend that inspired this post, and I hope these insights can help you on your own blogging journey.

# Truth ‚Ññ1: Blogging is a LOT of work

I hate to burst the bubble for anyone hoping to casually jot down their thoughts and eventually turn it into a side hustle‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt just happen by accident. If you want your blog to bring you money, you need to treat it like a business, not a hobby.

The online landscape is competitive, and developing a blog that attracts notable organic traffic requires strategy, planning, and an unwavering commitment to showing up‚Äîeven when the results seem slow to come.

We live in an age where we‚Äôre constantly bombarded with ads promising fast results. Instant website builders might make it easy to get started, but they don‚Äôt teach you how to sustain a blog or market it. That‚Äôs where many people lose interest. If you‚Äôre serious about building a successful blog, I highly recommend investing time in learning the basics of branding and content marketing to position yourself for success.¬†

# Truth ‚Ññ2: Blogging requires investment

Starting a blog for free is absolutely possible, BUT as your blog grows, you‚Äôll quickly realize that free resources might not be sufficient enough. So, financial investment is inevitable.

At the very least, you‚Äôll need to budget for essentials like a domain name, reliable hosting, website security, and a good template.¬†

Beyond the basics, there are other tools that can make your blogging life easier and help you grow faster. SEO tools, design software, social media scheduling apps, etc. Depending on your goals, you might also want to outsource tasks like logo design, web development, content writing, or some even get professional photography done.

# Truth ‚Ññ3: Prepare to be constantly thinking about your blog

Blogging will consume a lot of your mental energy‚Äînot just the time spent planning and writing posts or tweaking your site. You‚Äôll find yourself thinking about topics during your morning coffee, reading post-worthy news late at night, or mentally composing sentences while running errands.

This constant engagement can be both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it means you‚Äôre fully invested in your blog's growth. On the other hand, it can feel overwhelming, especially if you don‚Äôt set boundaries.

# Truth ‚Ññ4: You and your blog will change as you grow and it‚Äôs OKAY

Your blog doesn‚Äôt need to have a perfectly defined niche on day one, nor does it need to stay exactly the same forever. As you grow and learn, your interests may shift, and so might the focus of your blog. That‚Äôs okay!

Don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment with new formats, topics, or ideas. Some of the most successful bloggers are those who allowed themselves to evolve and adapt over time.

I have made the experience that ADF is for me sometimes maintainable and some weeks not.. Sometimes it gets so fucking hard and I get emtional and uncomfortable, when I then fail to fast I unfortunately have cravings and binges and feel like a looser. It seems that it's pretty easy in my first half of the cycle and in the other half it begins getting hard. And now I want to try to be more friendly to me and to find a schedule which fits my needs.

Does any other women made this experience too?

So now, I want to try a new schedule for me to be in harmony with my cycle:

**Generally**:  
\- Saturday/Sunday: No fasting  
\- No alcohol, coffee or caffein anymore, it can be, that this also have massive influence on my mood and it can bring hormones out of balance. I have read that in many books and it seems to be true for me

**My new schedule:**

**1) Day 1 to 11** (menstruation + follicular phase):  
Fast as much as possible ADF - or maybe a 5 day water fast (I will give it a try, because I have had a lot 36 hours fasts in the past and I think I can manage it, but if it gets too hard, I switch to ADF)

**2) Day 12 - 14** (ovulation):  
No fasting, 2000 - 2200 kcal and focus on health meals full of good carbs, fats and lots of protein <3

**3) Day 15-19** (early luteal phase):  
I will TRY to fast (if it is not saturday/sunday), but when I begin feeling bad, I will stop immediately

**4) Day 20-26:** (late luteal phase/PMS):  
No fasting, 2000 - 2200 kcal and focus on health meals full of good carbs, fats and lots of protein <3

This week, I was visited by a woman who had almost died from cancer. She survived and her hair has grown back, though you can still see her scalp.

Since we were at a family house, and she knows her way around, I let her move freely.

The whole time she was here, she was smoking cigarettes, drinking strong coffee whenever she was thirsty, sipping carbonated water, and eating a takeaway meal she reheated in the microwave.

I couldn't help but think: you've survived cancer multiple times, your body isn‚Äôt fully recovered, and yet this is how you choose to live? It took hours for the smell of cigarettes to fade after she left.

I thought that after undergoing multiple operations due to cancer, one would learn to live a healthier lifestyle.

I‚Äôve done some research and I see that it‚Äôs something that is developed with evolution and that I might be one of the night owl people but I genuinely can‚Äôt do it anymore.

I want to work during the daytime, no matter what I do I can get easily distracted, say that I‚Äôll do whatever I need to later and just lay on my bed and doom scroll, and the worst part is the afternoon (4-7pm) where I literally do nothing and feel like shit, sometimes I sleep and sometimes I doom scroll but I genuinely feel stupid as it‚Äôs the time I could do stuff but at the same time I feel like there is ‚Äúno time left‚Äù and that it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot worth doing anything‚Äù because for some reason I think that I need to do something at around 8/9pm???

and then I distract myself with yt, eating, scrolling tt and somehow getting tired of all that and just laying down

The saddest part is that I‚Äôve started hating that work time due to how late it is and how tired I can get from sleeping anywhere from 2-8hours depending on the day

I know it‚Äôs winter and all and you get a bit depressed due to how gray everything outside is, but How the fuck do I escape this??
How do all of the successful people actually sit down and do their shit, I have no problem working I won‚Äôt refuse doing any work no matter how difficult it is, but man I can‚Äôt focus at all at any time except after midnight.

1i8slom,https://www.reddit.com/r/bugbounty/comments/1i8slom/vdps_masquerading_as_bbs/,VDPs masquerading as BBs,"So, over the years I‚Äôve done blue team gigs at dozens of organisations that had a BB, and I‚Äôve also submitted reports myself on a couple of hundred programmes, either direct (Apple, Google etc) and also through the normal aggregators (Hacker1, Bugcrowd, Intigriti etc).

Now, some of these programmes have been awesome. They publish a clear scope. Communicate well. And act reasonably when assessing the risk of a bug, and ultimately awarding a bounty. For example, in my experience, Google have been brilliant to deal with. My reports have often been triaged and confirmed within a couple of hours of submitting them. And they have a clear payout table for bugs, where even shitty reflected XSS (on the main domains) will earn you $15k. Boom baby! And that results in a positive feedback loop for Google too: if I have a spare hour to put into a programme, they are way up at the top of my list.

But, at the other end of the scale are organisations that say they have a BB, when actually they have a safe-harbour or VDP. That‚Äôs because they know a lot of the better hunters don‚Äôt work on VDPs, so instead they call it a BB, then systematically find ways to get out of paying the bounty, such as downgrading bugs, or claiming them to be already known (when they aren‚Äôt).

And how do I know this? It‚Äôs because many of the organisations that I‚Äôve worked contracts for have had a slack channel for the BB discussions, and in them has been the managers and the triage staff having literally that conversation. And when you‚Äôve seen the inner workings a few times, it is easy to spot the same outward facing behaviours when working as a hunter.

The sad thing is that these organisations are often huge, with vast resources (hey, their organisation-wide coffee bill will be more than the BB cost ;) and yet they‚Äôre shafting people for a few grand.

In the same way that the main platforms provide a signal rating for the quality of the hunters‚Äô submissions, from a hunter‚Äôs perspective I think it would be really useful to have a similar (objective) rating for the programmes. And obviously I know that will never happen, as it isn‚Äôt in the benefit of the platforms or the organisations that pay their bills. ;)

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

During summer it was 39c inside because our air con didn‚Äôt work with the door wide open and now during the winter period it‚Äôs been below 8c inside. The door is directly in front of the checkouts and the coffee machines meaning the wind blows directly on us standing there. 

Just wondering what the best course of action would be here? 

We have complained to our boss who‚Äôs understanding and he has complained to his boss but the boss above her just wants the door left open due to ‚Äòprofits‚Äô. They have sent several engineers out who have all said we just need a new door but they refuse to invest in one. 

I‚Äôve just come back to work this week from being sick for 3 weeks with pneumonia and the door is now wide open with the light fixtures blowing in the wind and customers complaining about the cold.

Before I start I have read other tea related to questions but many are ""old"" and they didn't reply if any of the tips they got worked.

I had help from coworkers who LOVES tea but still taste like hot water (they made 2 tea cups for me)

I have tried temp a few years back, I have also tried adding suger, milk and honey (done diffrent combos).

I use tea bags for I don't want to buy expensive tea just for me not to drink it. Tried to keep them a bit longer in the water but was told not to do that either for it isn't good to do.

My first ever tea was green tea then I tried fruit teas and black teas too.



I really want to learn to drink tea so I can have some hot drink instead of hot chocholate (coffee is better cold to me) but maybe I should give up on tea?

1i8sdaf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i8sdaf,Toffee Coffee's Wine Barrel Aged Coffee & French Press,"Hey all,

This is my second experiment coffee of 2025 (you can read about my first one here - https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1i3hloe/blue_tokai_kaldipress/). This coffee is Toffee Coffee's Cabernet Sauvignon - Wine Barrel Aged Coffee (https://toffeecoffeeroasters.com/products/cabernet-sauvignon-wine-barrel-aged-coffee)

So, here's what I have used: 

- Ground Coffee - 20gm (coarse for French Press)
- Water - 200gm
- Brew time - 4 minutes.

My review:

I liked this one, but it could have been better. Maybe BT's wine-barrel-aged coffees have set a bar in my mind. I do get some notes of wine & berries in this one, but it is not as strong. I can recommend this one since Blue Tokai's Wine Barrel Aged Coffee (https://bluetokaicoffee.com/products/wine-barrel-aged) is sold out.

Again, I am not an expert coffee maker, so I would appreciate any suggestions.

P.S. None of these brands sponsored me.",5,1737714188.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False
1i8scsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1i8scsn/how_to_use_vintage_pieces_to_add_unique_charm_to/,How to Use Vintage Pieces to Add Unique Charm to Modern Decor,"Incorporating vintage pieces into modern interiors is a timeless trend that effortlessly adds personality and charm to any space. Whether it‚Äôs a carefully curated [white ceramic vase](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/white-ceramic-vase), a plush [pouf seating](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/poufs) arrangement, or a retro-inspired artwork, vintage elements can elevate your space and create a look that feels both curated and cozy. Here's how to seamlessly blend vintage treasures with contemporary aesthetics for a truly unique home.

# 1. Start with Statement Vintage Accessories

Small vintage items can make a big impact when styled correctly. A white ceramic vase with intricate detailing, for instance, can add elegance and character to a modern console table or bookshelf. Pair it with fresh blooms or dried pampas grass for a mix of vintage charm and contemporary flair.

**Styling Tip:** Place a group of vintage vases in varying sizes on a modern marble or glass coffee table for an eye-catching vignette.

# 2. Balance with Modern Furniture

To keep your space feeling fresh and uncluttered, pair vintage pieces with clean-lined modern furniture. For example, combine a mid-century credenza with [bohemian decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/decorations), such as a macram√© wall hanging or a rattan accent chair. This mix of styles creates an inviting, eclectic look without overwhelming the space.

**Pro Tip:** Look for neutral vintage items that blend seamlessly with your existing decor, like distressed wood furniture or softly patterned textiles.

# 3. Add Vintage Seating for Comfort and Style

Seating options like pouf seating or antique upholstered chairs can bring a cozy vintage vibe to your living room or bedroom. Poufs, in particular, are versatile pieces that fit perfectly in bohemian decor settings. Use them as extra seating, footrests, or even side tables when topped with a tray.

**Design Idea:** Pair an earthy-toned pouf with a sleek modern sofa for a warm, layered look that invites relaxation.

# 4. Create a Focal Point with Vintage Rugs

Vintage rugs are perfect for anchoring a room and adding a splash of color and texture. Their intricate patterns and rich hues complement modern minimalist interiors while adding a sense of history and artistry.

**Styling Advice:** Position a vintage rug in your living room under a coffee table or in your dining room to tie the space together. Check out [home decor shops in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) for unique vintage finds that match your style.

# 5. Accessorize with Vintage Ceramics and Glassware

Vintage ceramics, like a white ceramic vase or hand-painted dishes, can be displayed on open shelves or used as functional decor. Glassware with unique etchings or colorful designs also makes a beautiful addition to any room.

**Quick Tip:** Mix and match old and new pieces for an effortlessly chic, collected-over-time look.

# 6. Combine with Bohemian Decor for a Relaxed Vibe

If you love the laid-back aesthetic of bohemian decor, vintage pieces are a natural fit. Layer textured throws, patterned pillows, and antique furniture to create a space that feels both relaxed and stylish. Add natural materials like rattan, jute, or leather to complete the boho look.

**Decor Idea:** Pair an antique wooden trunk with pouf seating and a rattan pendant light for the ultimate boho-chic vibe.

# 7. Shop for Vintage Treasures in Dubai

Dubai is a treasure trove for unique home decor shops offering vintage finds. From artisan-crafted white ceramic vases to handwoven rugs and antique furniture, you'll find everything you need to infuse your home with vintage charm. Many of these shops also carry items that blend traditional Middle Eastern aesthetics with modern sensibilities, perfect for creating a one-of-a-kind look.

**Where to Look:** Visit local home decor shops in Dubai or explore vintage markets to uncover hidden gems that add character to your space.

**Final Thoughts**

Integrating vintage pieces into modern decor is all about balance. By thoughtfully combining elements like white ceramic vases, pouf seating, and bohemian decor, you can create a home that feels uniquely yours. Whether you‚Äôre starting small with accessories or making a bold statement with vintage furniture, your home will exude charm, style, and individuality.
