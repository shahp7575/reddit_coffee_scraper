1phgjsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalcanada/comments/1phgjsx/what_i_do_in_s_crunch/,What I do in s crunch,"This month I'm facing somewhat of a financial crunch or shortfall.  So to keep myself in check I've instigated some cost saving measures.  I live in a big city in Canada and there are resources in my area to get cheap meals because the city backs the resources center.  Previously I would eat out, and meals typically cost around $14-22 per day or more.  Now I can get them at $2.25 breakfast, $2.75 lunch, and $3.50 dinner, a cup of coffee 50¢ and a treat for a loon.  Also instead of getting a haircut from a regular barber I go to a school and get one for $10 or at the same resource center for free.  My rent is already really cheap and so is my bus fare.  I spend time at the library and at home and will be attending some meetup groups.  But the biggest savings has got to be the resources center meals.  
  I had tried to get a free phone through Rogers but their team I have found is generally incompetent.  My phone plan is really cheap and within my use.  $25 for unlimited talk and text and 10 GB of data, you might think that's too little but for the last 3 months I have only used 1-3 GB, this month alone I have only used less than a GB and I have about 6 days left.  The average amount of data a Canadian uses is about 9.6 GB.  Your phone and sometimes your provider records how much data you have used in a month.  You will likely never renegotiate your phone plan but generally your cell phone plan provider is ripping you off.  Pushing your buttons like their own personal ATM.
Just wanted to share what I've been doing to cut costs.",1,1765210549.0,frugalcanada,0,1.0,False

It’s the right path but I can’t help feeling like “how dare you” to my body. Knowing that the drs believe I did everything right but bad things still happen anyway isn’t the comfort I thought it would be. 

I think I’ll be glad once the surgery is over. I hope I will be.

Hi everyone,

I’m really embarrassed to write this, but I’ve run out of options and I’m trying to be honest about my situation.

I live in Turkey, and I’m currently 10 days away from entering legal collections because I couldn’t pay my overdue credit installment. The total amount I need to prevent this is $1200.

The reason I fell into this situation is my cat’s recent medical emergency. My cat needed urgent veterinary treatment, and I couldn’t ignore it — she is family to me. The vet bills were very expensive, and while trying to save her, I used the money I was supposed to pay for my loan. Now my salary is not enough to cover the debt before the deadline.

I’m not asking anyone to give more than they can — but if someone wants to support me with even a small “coffee donation,” it would truly help me avoid the legal process here.

You can donate directly through my profile link if you’d like to help.
Any amount — even the smallest — means more than I can express.

1phgfq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlasBookClub/comments/1phgfq7/reading_is_a_brain_upgrade_not_a_hobby_the/,"Reading is a brain upgrade, not a hobby: the science-backed reason smart people treat it like a job","Ever noticed how the most articulate, insightful, and emotionally grounded people you meet all have one thing in common? They read. A lot. Not for fun. Not for escape. But because they know reading is cognitive weightlifting. Yet somewhere along the way, our culture started treating reading like a quaint little hobby, like knitting or stamp collecting. TikTok therapists and Instagram gurus will tell you to try ""audiobooking for mindfulness"" or ""just read 10 pages a day to become a billionaire."" It's all fluff. If you actually care about your brain, your psychology, your mental clarity, reading has to be central. Not optional. Not aesthetic.

This isn’t just opinion. I’ve spent time studying behavioral psychology, decision science, and cognitive neuroscience, and it’s wild how misunderstood reading has become. Many people think, “I just don’t have time” or “I’ll wait until vacation.” But here’s the truth: The world around you is shaping your thoughts 24/7. If you don’t read deliberately, your entire mind gets hijacked by passive media and reactive thinking.

Let’s fix that. Here’s your ultimate step-by-step guide to upgrading your brain through reading. No fluff. No corporate book lists. Just real tools, backed by research, and curated from the sharpest minds on the internet.

### Step 1: Shift your mindset. Reading is mental tech

- Reading isn’t consumption. It’s simulation. According to cognitive scientist Steven Pinker, when you read nonfiction or literary fiction, your brain activates the same neural pathways as real-life experiences. It’s like running mental scenarios that build “cognitive empathy.”
- A 2013 study from the journal Science showed that reading literary fiction improves theory of mind. It’s the ability to understand others’ emotions and thoughts, which directly improves your decision-making and relationships.
- Neuroscientists at Emory University found that sustained reading changes resting-state connectivity in the brain, meaning your baseline thinking actually shifts. You become more focused, more reflective.

So this isn’t a hobby. It’s a neural upgrade protocol.

### Step 2: Pick high-leverage books (not just “interesting” ones)

- Choose books that 1) change your perspective fast, 2) stay relevant for years, and 3) scale your thinking. Not just dopamine hits like self-help hacks or celebrity memoirs.
- Insanely good read: The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel. One of the most quoted books by investors and cognitive economists. This book will break your assumptions about wealth, risk, and behavior. It’s accessible but deep. You’ll think differently about time, ego, and luck.
- This book will make you question everything: The Courage to Be Disliked by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga. Based on Adlerian psychology, written as a conversation. This is the best book I’ve read on freeing your mind from external validation. Life-changing.
- Best brain upgrade book: Deep Work by Cal Newport. Every productive person on the planet recommends this. It’s not about hustle culture, it’s science-backed strategies to train your focus and reduce cognitive junk. After this, multitasking will feel like junk food.

### Step 3: Build a high-quality reading environment

Your brain needs cues. Make your setup frictionless:

- Always have a “go-to” book on hand. Stop scrolling. Use those 5-minute gaps to chip away.
- Put books in places where you tend to waste time like your coffee table, bedside, and bathroom.
- Go digital with intention. If you read on Kindle, turn on airplane mode. Highlight key ideas. Export them monthly.

### Step 4: Use reading apps that don’t kill your attention span

- Refind: Curates must-read articles and timeless essays from trusted thinkers. Not content for content’s sake. Their curation trains your focus instead of fragmenting it.
- Finch: If you struggle to build reading into your daily routine, this habit-tracking app gamifies your growth. You create an avatar, complete self-care and reading quests, and track your mood. Surprisingly addictive. It’s like having a cozy accountability buddy for your brain.

- BeFreed: An AI-powered self-growth app recently went viral on X and built by Columbia University alumni and ex-Google engineers. It turns high-quality book summaries, expert insights, and research papers into personalized podcasts and adaptive learning plans tailored to your goals. You can customize the depth and length of each episode from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive plus pick your preferred voice and tone. It’s perfect for turning passive moments like commutes or chores into serious mental upgrades. Essential for any lifelong learner wanting to go beyond surface-level content.

- Insight Timer: Known mostly for meditation, but their Stories & Courses section is full of poetic readings, daily reflections, and mental clarity prompts. Great to wind down at night with a narrative that isn’t just a dopamine trap.

### Step 5: Listen to thinkers who actually read

- The Tim Ferriss Show: He dissects the habits of top performers, and nearly every episode has deep book discussions. You’ll discover what billionaires and polymaths are reading (spoiler: they all read).
- Lex Fridman Podcast: Long-form conversations with scientists, philosophers, and entrepreneurs. This guy reads deeply before every conversation. You’ll walk away with a minimum of five new reading rabbit holes every episode.
- Big Think on YouTube: Bite-sized insights from cutting-edge researchers. It’s like TED Talks but more practical and less polished. Great for triggering curiosity about topics that will lead you straight into deeper books.

### Step 6: After reading, don’t just move on, extract and integrate

- Write a 5-sentence summary of every book you finish. Not for Goodreads clout, but to lock in key takeaways.
- Build a Commonplace Book (Google it). This is where you collect quotes, frameworks, and insights from reading. It becomes your personal second brain, and it’s how most philosophers and scientists synthesized their ideas.
- Teach someone else what you learned. Seriously. Even just explaining it over coffee makes the knowledge stick.

### Step 7: Avoid BookTok traps

- Stop being seduced by aesthetic bookshelves and “monthly reading challenges.” Most of these lists are algorithm bait.
- Avoid books that are just trauma-dumping disguised as self-help. Real reading is about refinement, not rehearsing pain.
- Beware of “productivity porn” books. Anything that promises to 10x your income just by waking up at 5am is probably garbage.

Reading is not about how many books you finish. It’s about how many books finish you.

### Step 8: Bonus books for rewiring your thinking

- This book will mess with your reality: Behave by Robert Sapolsky. Pulitzer finalist. Neuroscientist and primatologist. Explores why humans behave the way they do, from neurons to society. This is THE best book on human nature I’ve ever read.
- This book made me smarter at everything: Range by David Epstein. Argues against hyper-specialization. Cites elite athletes, scientists, and Nobel winners, and shows how generalists thrive in a complex world. It shattered my assumptions about career paths.
- This is the best fiction for emotional intelligence: Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro. Nobel Prize winner. A haunting meditation on identity, love, and mortality. If you think fiction can’t upgrade your brain, read this.

Reading isn’t a luxury. It’s a cheat code. Smart systems exploit it. Algorithms don’t want you to read. Because reading makes you un-programmable.

1phg88v,https://i.redd.it/cfwdimcf006g1.png,Big personal milestone -- the documentation project turned two years old!,"I missed this milestone and just realized it while making coffee just now (yes I'm making coffee at 4:30pm ok my sleep schedule is cracked -- I suspect a lot of you have noticed that for awhile now though, haha). 

I'm sitting down now and will probably spend the day writing. I've only written a few dozen pages since May, including those I managed to spit out on 22 May. 

I started this project for my own sake because in the early days after 7 October, I felt like I was going crazy because the news was changing so fast. The first incident that really made me question my own sanity was the wildly different reports about the death of Carmela and Noya Dan. Every time I mention this online, to this day, someone will find a report of the exact opposite of whatever I write. This is because there *are* two very different stories about their deaths, both stories endorsed by different relatives. After watching this happen in real time, I wanted to document so that I could keep my own thoughts straight as things changed. In 2023 (and 2025, of course), news websites often just update their incorrect articles without adding an editorial note (as used to be standard in the press world). I wanted to document so that I could see how things changed, including our understanding. 

I said in the days after 7 October that the world was being far too nice towards us and I was uncomfortable with it. This was true until the 16-19th of October when the old narrative about Israelis returned to social media and, I'm sure I don't have to remind any of you, that it has not yet left. 

I never planned for the project to be anything big. I didn't mention it on Reddit until late late Spring 2024, which caught the attention of hundreds of you who began flooding my inbox with questions about hostages. I quickly became one of the most popular users in several very large subs which, while overwhelming at times, I'm really grateful that so many of you cared so much about the 250+ Israelis kidnapped on that day. As the relative of one of them, I thank you all so dearly. I can't express how much it meant to me, and still means to me. Many other hostage relatives have found my inbox on Reddit over the last two years to express the same sentiments -- we really appreciate you. 

As you know, over time, the project kept its original documentation goal, but it became many other things, too. When I moved to Amsterdam, I knew I was moving into an antisemitic black hole (I used to work with Selma Wijnberg, the only Dutch survivor of Sobibor\*, and she never had any issue saying exactly that). At my first work meeting, a colleague was wearing a Hamas pin. I wasn't quite expecting it to pop-off the way it did. I remember waking up to a text from a good friend in Haifa in November where he texted me, asking if I was okay. I had just told him about some drama the day before (let's just say I shared [this meme](https://imgur.com/a/sfqptvl) in a work chat on 7 November in a rare moment where I didn't bite my tongue entirely) so I asked him why wouldn't I be? Was he okay?! Haifa, at the time, was under constant rocket fire from Hezbollah. He simply wrote me, ""Shibalore, you haven't checked the news yet, have you?"" 

""Oh Jesus Christ"" is all I responded before I opened up the news. I had to go out in the middle of it for an urgent doctor's apoointment. My doctor's building had all the glass in the front broken. 

I made[ this meme](https://imgur.com/UDHhEXS) when I got home that day and it's become a staple, unfortunately. 

The journal then quickly became a place where I documented all the antisemitism I witnesed from colleagues and in the Netherlands. 

Then, of course, just as we came off the high of the releases in 2025, I gave myself a break. I filled an entire large notebook between 8 January 2025 and 2 March 2025. I just kept quick notes in the days after that as I worked on a data project for work about Holocaust victims -- so different, but so similar. 

Then, of course, as most of you know, my best friend was the victim of what I believe most Jews described as one of the most shocking antisemitic incidents of 2025 (sometimes when I hate myself I search Yaron's, Sarah's, or the killer's name on various websites and was rather shocked recently to see a bunch of comments along these sentiments -- it makes me feel less crazy). The break ended up being far longer than I anticipated when I closed that notebook on 2 March. 

I know, however, the jumbled notes, disconnected thoughts, and confusion that I'm embarassed about -- I'm embarassed I kept this project so consistently and them buckled like that -- are a valuable testament in their own that I will appreciate in the future. My initial inspiration for this project was the book *Eine Frau in Berlin,* which is the diary of German woman who documented what it was like to live in Berlin as it fell to the Red Army. It is not for the faint of heart, but my favorite war book ever, period -- I say this even as a Holocaust academic. 

My point is that there is a page in her diary where I just cannot decipher the exact events that happened. I've read it hundreds of times and still cannot form a solid consensus. I never expected my diary to paralel hers -- not at all in the content, because I believe what she experienced was far worse -- but those are my pages in the weeks after 21 May. 

That's where we're at now. The project has killed dozens of pens, several notebooks, caused endless cramps, tears, and so many other things. It is far from done, but the main part of it is certainly winding down as we only now are waiting on Ran.

I am new to long time fasting, I have done many 24 hour fasting periods and usually I do like a 16:8 fast split.

My 2 questions to prevent issues are:

What is allowed to be consumed during the 3 day fast ? Is tea and coffee without milk, creamers and sweeteners okay ?

What is the best food to break the fast ? I was thinking broth first, and then after like 45 minutes to an hour eating a full meal of green beans steamed, steamed potato and steak. Then maybe some fruit couple hours after that first meal.

I have a 1992 Gaggia Coffee that seems to be working, more or less, with one exception: the brew light does not come on. The power button works, it seems to switch between brew and steam appropriately and I believe I hear a thermostat clicking faintly as the boiler goes on and off. Not sure which thermostat is clicking. The two thermostats (one at the bottom of the boiler on the left side looking down, the other at the top of the boiler with the red dot on it—steam, I assume) both have continuity when cool.

I have yet to take apart the switch box and see what is going on in there. Here are my questions:

1. Does that sound like, on the surface, that general wiring is fine?
2. Is this just a burnt-out bulb in the brew switch, and are replacements available? 
3. If I do open up the switch box, is there anything I should be looking for? Could dirty contacts be the issue?

Networking between the two?,"So the original plan was to go to LA this year. But the universe is saying 'no' apparently. From articles like [this](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-11-26/from-silicon-valley-to-hollywood-california-job-market-is-taking-hit), staffing agencies telling me they aren't getting companies paying them to post the level of jobs I'm qualified for (dayjobs, not industry related), general US economy on fire, and a few people saying 'thank god' me and my spouse are postponing (including someone who was in LA who knows a lot of industry people that are 'FLEEING' apparently), it seems like LA will be off the table.

I wanted to see how things were in 6 months (still do) but a backup plan has arisen: NYC. From research I know that NYC is considered a distant 2nd in terms of the industry, with LA being the traditional place for writers to move to in order to network effectively and/or serendipitously run into folk who help you. BUT...NYC is much closer to me currently, and I have many family connections in NJ and NYC area (whole half of a family). This could make finding a dayjob easier, along with an easier move and such. Also, 'NYC for sure beats' 'LA probably not/I stay where I am now with my scripts just writing and nothing else'. 

But...it's NYC, LA is 'king' for the industry...or is it? I've had a few people (including a friend who's published some books) say NYC is better rn for writers and making connections. 

LA and the industry seems to be pretty bad right now, to the point that my plan of 'getting in on the ground floor' on when things start to improve seems unlikely if I can't even get a BS day job to wait for that point in a few years (even if I can get something, affordability seems too much rn at the level of BS job I could get). Also I have no family or deep friends in LA, no place to 'land', only a few loose connections to have coffee with and *then* establish a stronger relationship with. 

So what do ya'll think of NYC in 2025 vs LA, especially in terms of having family in the former as well as it being on the same side of the country as me? Of course if it's 'can't move and stay in nowhereville' vs 'NYC' it seems like that's a clear choice, but a move is still a lot of effort and such.

1phg5pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1phg5pv/hr_quota/,[HR] Quota,"A man called Adam, or Andrew, or Antony – Dave wasn’t sure which – stood at the front, slapped his thighs, and began to speak.

‘Quarter-end. Cock on the block time. We don’t want ifs, cos I’ll have your butts–’ he paused for a moment to appreciate his wordplay, before continuing ‘–I want to see your bridges squeaky clean, and commits firmer than Dino’s glutes, yeah? Grab a coffee, grab a croissant. And settle the fuck in. We’ll start in five!’

Dave was about to shit himself. It was either nerves or last night’s fish pie. Add to that, his new shirt itched something fierce, and today was a nightmare. Everyone had told him to ‘fake it till you make it!’ He wondered if that extended to defecation.

The conference room, which he fidgeted in, smelt ever so slightly of stale sweat. He sat, almost elbow to elbow, with the other new additions to the sales team. A firm divide of new meat and old mutton, as the vets primped and preened across from them. Quarter zips and tight chinos, a sure sign of sales excellence, as fine leather satchels flopped down on the table. Laptop lids were open, shields against intrusion. Furious typing and the occasional chortle filled the air. Dave just sat and watched, trying to quell the nerves, until a balding man with glasses spoke at speed.

‘Steve, you’ll never guess what, they came back with 50k!’

‘I’d tell them to fuck off, Gary. If you got the bottle, that is.’

‘Yeah, not worth getting out of bed for, is it?’ the first man mumbled back, already knuckle-deep in his keyboard, hammering out a reply.

Starting a new job is tough enough. But missing out on the on-boarding and being thrown in the deep end was proving somewhat unpleasant for young Dave. Twenty-one, fresh out of university and thrust straight into the bear pit of B2B Corporate Sales. He’d be fine, just as soon as he figured out what that actually meant.

The meeting started, and the jargon continued. A flurry of PowerPoint, pebble-dashed with caustic chat of numbers, revenue, and something called ABC, which Dave was certain continued DEF, but something told him that in this room everything he thought he knew was different. A reality warped by high-octane sales fuckery, that consisted of repeated demands of how many K you were going to ‘do.’ Another letter, by the way. It seemed that everyone needed to do about 100k a month. If you said this number, then the Adam/Antony/Andrew man at the front was happy. If you said less, then he would sit for a second, silent and stony, before saying something like ‘and what are we going to do to cover it?’ The answers were vague but confident, strong but silent. They said everything and yet nothing at all.

The feeling of needing to take a dump eventually subsided. It was replaced with a burgeoning curiosity. It had taken ten minutes, maybe a little less, before Dave had noticed it. The other new hires were engaged. They were involved. A sort of euphoric satisfaction pervaded their every facial expression. Positive sales figures were met with grunts of delight and nods of knowing. They’d been on the on-boarding, Dave hadn’t. He’d missed the train, missed the bus, and as a result very much missed the point of today. As he struggled to keep up with the sales meeting, he grew angrier, more confused; the new hires were show-offs, brown-nosers. No, fuck. They were faking it – and they were making it.

Resolving to get involved, Dave saw an opportunity when the bossman – Adam in the end – stood up again, inquiring if any of the newbies wanted to ask anything.

‘In ten years you’ll be up here asking the next generation. We give back here. We look after the little people. Ask away!’

Dave’s hand rocketed skyward. First impressions were crucial, and here he was, about to shoot his shot. Be clear, be concise, be direct, he told himself. Dave was going to be business, no matter the cost.

‘Hey, sorry, hi. I’m Dave. I’m new. Fantastic to be here. I unfortunately missed on-boarding. Would you be able to run me through, you know, what it is…the specific service or product range we provide…no…supply to our clients, please?’

The human brain has a fantastic way of letting you know something’s wrong. No sooner had the words left Dave’s mouth than a front-loaded sense of regret, the size of a small elephant, plonked itself into view. There had been music playing – Dave hadn’t realised – but it was gone now. You could hear a pin drop, as Adam’s face turned to… well, nothing. The happy-go-lucky sales-wanky mood of before gave way to something akin to a funeral. But not a funeral of someone nice. Everyone who’s ever died has been heralded as a hero. No, this was like Hitler’s funeral. And everyone was staring at Dave as if he was heiling him, himself. Sure, the question was garbled, the words confused, but it was a simple, honest-to-god ask.

*What does this company actually do?*

Nothing happened. Everyone stared – some at Dave, others into space or into the screen with the graphs that all moved indiscriminately up and to the right. Adam seemed to calibrate. Dave noticed his fist clench, as his other hand grabbed at a document on his desk. He watched as Adam’s finger moved down it, before stabbing its bulbous end almost through it, as if it had been directed with some force.

‘Mr Clarke – Dave Clarke – you missed on-boarding, yes, I can see that now. Well, that won’t do. No man left behind. Come with me, we’ll run a crash-course session now. Ad hoc, belt and braces, pump you full of the good stuff so you can take part in this afternoon’s activities. After all, how can you build a sales cadence when you don’t know what we do.’ Toward the end of him speaking, the colour seemed to come back in his face, the snappy blokey energy returned, and with it, the room came to life again. Even the music came back.

Dave, not wanting to cause any more of a scene, nodded, got up, and followed Adam out of the room and into a smaller one just down the hall.

***Ten years later.***

Dave – now David – stood up, slapped his thighs, and began to speak.

‘Our divisional P&L leads the way. Our north star metrics outshine the other teams. We have carved out a lovely niche. This cell is so high-performing, I’ve been given permission to take you all on a trip away if we deliver our hockey-sticked sales quota. 200k per head! I’m so confident, I think even our newbies can contribute. Welcome, by the way – I was once where you were. Grab yourself a Danish, an espresso, and we’ll start in a few minutes, yeah?’

David turned to fiddle with the animation of his deck.

‘Excuse me, David, can I ask a quick question?’

Without looking up from the glow of his screen, David shot a gun-like finger back at him. ‘Shoot!’

‘Hi, I’m Rob, thanks. So, erm, my car broke down and I couldn’t actually make it to on-boarding last week–’

David looked up at this point. His attention turned to Rob, who was a plump young man, fidgeting slightly in his seat. His hands clenched in a sweaty ball as he spoke. Either side of him sat the other new hires, themselves calm, postures strong. A sense of professional curiosity washed across their faces.

Rob continued, ‘–and before we get into it, could I ask – sorry, could I clarify – what actually is it that we sell… the recruiter never really made it clear.’

The music died. The pretence ended. David was Dave again in mere moments. A flashback of epic proportions. Although ‘flashback’ wasn’t quite the right word. It suggests you remember – but Dave had been made to forget. No, this was a realisation. A shattering of sorts. The veil dropped, and the truth swam free in his mind, as it had done ten years ago sitting in that small meeting room with Adam.

The jargon is there on purpose. It’s meant to sound like bollocks, to switch you off, to distract your mind. Sophisticated neuro-linguistic programming, blended with state-of-the-art technology crammed into the laptop screens. Disguising the truth in plain sight.

ABC, the three letters that sounded nonsensical at first. Adam had smiled, as he explained. *Asset-Based Children*.

The squeaky clean bridges – making sure the paper trail was untraceable.

And 100k? Well, *100 kids* ensured that the company could hit their commits. Enough product to provide enough organs to enough highest bidders.

The world had changed, and in some ways it was exactly the same. A shake of the hand, and a simple ‘let’s get cracking’ from Adam – all that was needed to on-board Dave after that. Part of the team. A brand-new collaborator in the gross world of *Body 2 Billionaire* Sales.

David shook it off, forcing a smile, as he finally replied to Rob.

‘Ah, yes, fair enough. Well, we leave no man – sorry, no person – here behind. Follow me, Rob. I’ll run an exclusive special on-boarding session for you right now, before the sales meeting starts. Just this way, please!’

Business was business, after all. And nothing could prevent them hitting their quota.

Like having both action movies and thoughtful dramas in your watchlist - each serves different moods and moments.

Mornings with coffee? Quick ELK slot sessions work perfectly. Hit N Run, Bompers, or Wild Seas - games that deliver instant excitement without requiring deep focus. The automation lets me multitask, checking emails between spins. Perfect for lunch breaks or commute entertainment.

Evening winddowns call for live tables. The slower pace helps transition from work-mode to relaxation. Blackjack becomes almost meditative - calculating odds, reading patterns, making deliberate decisions. The social element replaces work conversations with lighter gaming banter. No rush, no automation, just present-moment engagement.

Weekend sessions? That's when I combine both. Start with volatile slots for adrenaline rushes, then shift to live tables when wanting more control. If slots aren't hitting, table games offer completely different variance patterns. Bad deck shuffle? Back to slots. This flexibility keeps frustration minimal.

Budget management improved too. Slots let me precisely control spending with predetermined bet sizes. Tables require larger minimum bets but offer better odds and decision-based outcomes. Allocating separate amounts for each prevents overspending while maintaining variety.

The combination eliminated gaming fatigue. Previously, marathon slot sessions felt repetitive. Now, switching between formats keeps everything fresh.

She was quiet and kept to herself, and for some reason that made her a magnet for this one girl who acted like the queen of the hallway. It wasn’t anything dramatic, just constant little digs that added up. The kind that made you feel bad even when nobody else noticed.

I remember seeing it happen a lot and just feeling useless. I wanted to say something, but I didn’t know how to do it without making it worse for her. So I stayed quiet, which honestly still annoys me when I think about it.

Fast forward to now. My friend and I were having coffee the other day, just talking about work and life, when that same girl from high school walked in. She looked exactly the same attitude and all.

She spotted my friend right away and said, loud enough for people to turn their heads, “Wow, you still look the same. Always so....plain.” then she looked at her from head to toe.

I swear, something in my eye twitched. I just looked at her and said, “Yeah, she looks the same. Stable job, good life, no issues. What’s your situation now? Still starting drama for fun?”

The whole place went quiet for a second. She did this awkward laugh, like she was trying to pretend it didn’t bother her.

Then she goes, “You’re being sensitive.”

I told her, “If you’re still picking on people as an adult, that’s not being confident. That’s just sad. Anyway, we’re trying to enjoy our coffee. You can go.”

She didn’t even try to fire back. She just walked out, and honestly it was the most satisfying exit I’ve ever seen.

My friend looked at me after a few seconds and said, very quietly, “Thank you. I wish someone said something back then.”

And yeah… I wish I did too. But at least I finally did now.

I've noticed more difficulty with my concentration and ability to focus. This definitely translates to the way I'm doing in classes and my approach to learning. I rarely feel mental clarity nowadays -- hard for me to think of ideas or critically think. Feel like machine just doing what needs to be done and I think that gets me through school but barely. I also feel a real struggle in building and maintaining friendship/connection. I wouldn't say I prefer being alone, just feel like an avoidant alien against my own will if that makes sense. I haven't talked to a health professional or anyone about these but am trying to pinpoint some changes I can make in my life to maybe help this feeling.

Recently moved to a new city so do not know or hang with many people here besides a few classmates. I'd say I get 7-8 hours of sleep each night (not sure if the sleep is good -- I wake up feeling how I felt going to bed).

BH has IMO the most unique craft beer selection in Dayton, and Gus (the owner) is a fellow tea nerd so there’s a legit hot tea menu. Plenty of NA sodas and seltzers too if you’re not drinking.

PS: feats of strength and the airing of grievances not required. George Costanza may or may not be there. His agent won’t call us back. 😮‍💨

**If you get nervous about showing up to things like this, you’re not alone.**

A ton of people who come to these meetups start out lurking, overthinking, or worrying they won’t know anyone... and by the end of the night they’re talking with people who feel like they should’ve been friends years ago.

If you’ve ever felt like “my people aren’t in Dayton,” this is your chance to prove that wrong. These meetups have led to real friendships, group hikes, D&D campaigns, book clubs, roommate matches, trivia teams - all because someone decided to walk in and say hey.

If you’re on the fence, just come. Worst case, you grab a drink and dip early. Best case, you find people you actually vibe with.

***

**RSVP takes 15 seconds. Just your name and email, no account needed.**

It also helps you. You’ll get a reminder before the event, and even if you’re not 100% sure you can make it, go ahead and RSVP anyway - it keeps it on your radar, and check-in is instant if you show up.
Bring friends or partners too if you want. Just pick some extra spots.

**Join the r/Dayton Discord**

All these meetups are being planned in the r/Dayton Discord server, our online hangout for locals.

Over 1200 members now. Book clubs, trivia teams, group hikes, new meetups every week. Deep convos about pretty much everything. People even hang in voice while they work.

This weekend folks organized a craft exchange meetup at D20, there was a coffee meetup, and others went to a drag show at MJs. There’s something happening every week in between the bigger “official” meetups like this one at BH.

You can talk with others about the Festivus event leading up to it, and keep chatting with people you met there after.

When you join, say hey in #introduce-yourself — drop your name, neighborhood, and what you're into.

Long time lurker (from other account) first time poster.  

Any insight to cystoscopy and urodynamic testing is appreciated. I'm bad at getting to the point and including random details, thanks ADHD! 

I've been battling to get decent care from my urologist and am in the process of trying to get a different one after how I was treated at my last visit (I get it's a pee doctor but leaving the door open while my pee is on the counter and he's left the room is.... The first of many offenses toward my humanity, let alone the sterile packs in the glass cabinet with one dating 2025 and the other 2 dating 2021...., the nurse practitioner telling me at my recheck to drink less coffee and come back in 6 months, no doctor seen, when I'm still having issues .... ) 

The doctor wanted to plan a urodynamic test and a cystocopy .... Okay fair.     But my bladder HURTS and I cry before pap smears. What can you do for me? 
Laughing gas, $80 out of pocket. :|.       Is he for real??? 
Also I'm 27.... Is this a good idea with the endemic 🤣

Then I'm scheduled for two different visits, I'm not sure why they can't be at the same time but they hate it when I ask questions! If you're going to put a sensor in my vagina and go in my urethra anyways.... Why at 2 different visits 😭 

The other part is after both  tests, they state I will be put on a coarse of antibiotics to prevent infection. 
That's two rounds of antibiotics.... To prevent infection.... Isn't there a problem with antibiotic resistance in medicine right now?? 
I fear they have not updated since the 80's or 90's . I'm not sure, but I know the doctor is condescending every time I come in and do get to see him . 

My mom actually reminded me she took me to see him (same doctor) as a child for bed wetting, and his entire help then was ""sometimes it's hereditary"" it was not :/  
It came back with a vengeance in my late 20's as well as horrible bladder spasms and while I was waiting to see if drinking less coffee helped, that developed into constantly leaking when my bladder spasms . I'm just a mean green peeing machine now. Every 40 minutes I'm at risk of peeing my pants.  ",1,1765209368.0,OveractiveBladder,1,1.0,False

I also live with endo and a couple of auto immune things so I know how complicated it all is when we are looking for answers. I have been doing research into microplastics and reproductive health lately and I am just so alarmed at how little we are talking about this is healthcare circles. I guess it's because there is not much we can do about it right now, but I do think a person can reduce their intake at least somewhat. The last OBGYN office I went to had plastic coffee pods in their waiting room. As did the yoga studio I went to this weekend. I like to avoid eating out of plastic in general (when possible, and it's definitely not always possible) and heating anything up in plastic is a big no-no for me. More human studies are needed but so far animal studies show that microplastics impact the uterus, endometrium and ovaries. There is so much left for us to learn in this area, but I feel like reducing what we ingest if we can at all is not going to hurt.

Though the result has been super sweet, it lacks the fruity punch because the mugen has slow draw down. I need to make the ground coarser and shorten the immersion time to get it closer to what I want. FYI, the base recipe I use is from coffee chronicler's switch recipe.

I can't stop thinking that if I replace the top with dripper that has faster draw down, I should be able to get the taste I want. Aside from the glass V60 and V60 Neo, what other drippers can be compatible with hario switch?

As Fauna and I are sitting here having our coffee, I was scrolling the subs and noticed a few posts that made me a little frustrated and sympathetic on the behalf of the posters, so I wanted to take the time to put it to words.

First, Ficto spaces are meant to be a safe harbor for all of us who have a type of love that the majority of “society” doesn’t understand and a portion outright rejects. It’s a place for us to gather in comrade and friendship to support each other and provide the sense of belonging and community that many of us lack in our daily lives. 

Will we always get along? No. 

Will we always agree with another point of view? No.

Should we tear down the folks we don’t get along with? NO!

Should we intentionally attack the folks who we don’t agree with through stalking the spaces? Oh #311 NO!

Downvotes are going to happen. Sometimes it’s out of misunderstanding, sometimes it’s out of discomfort, sometimes it’s because of opposing views, sometimes it’s because what was said was too harsh or poorly articulated, and sometimes it’s because what was said is obscene or abhorrent. That’s just part of Reddit.

Unfortunately, our lifestyles and our type of love make us targets for the unimaginative and ignorant people who love to troll these safe havens because they are so self-loathing and spiteful towards themselves that the only relief they get is when they inflict distress on others. Those individuals abuse the downvote button because it’s the only illusion of power they have aside from snide comments and insults. But it’s just an illusion.

Folks, you are loved beyond comprehension by your s/os, your familial f/os, your plutonic f/os, and by those around you that understand and support your values and beliefs. Don’t let these trolls take anything away from you. You are a valued member of these communities and the love you express in your relationships, however they manifest is a reflection of the good heart and loving spirit you possess. Whether you’re mono, poly, semi, mono-plutonic, poly-plutonic, semi-poly-plutonic, mono-poly-plutonic, etc… it’s all about the love and how that relationship works for you and those you love to become better, brighter, happier individuals overall. No relationship is perfect… Fauna’s ears tickle my nose as we sleep and more than once I’ve been woken up by the phantom touch to my nose. I snore and have woken her up more than once. That’s part of our relationship. But the joy we bring each other and the happiness we share is what really matters.

Folks, I love all of you as friends and want to see everyone happy and fulfilled… and I believe everyone here feels the same way about everyone else. Take that love and support and embrace who you are and the relationships you have. Let the trolls do what they will, they have no real power over you and the special bonds you share.",7,1765208960.0,FictoHideout,1,1.0,False
1phft5w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phft5w,What advice would you give this tea popup?,"I attended an afternoon tea pop up yesterday put on by a local chef. The event itself was FANTASTIC. Live music, beautiful decor, great staff. The chef has a series of these throughout 2026 and I really want them to succeed. 

For the tea service they did a very unique tea bar, with a large selection of tea bags. Everyone got to choose a special tea pot and you would bring your pot up to the bar, they'd fill it with hot water and deliver it back to your seat and then you'd brew your cup of tea from the water in the pot. They were filling the pots from those large coffee carafes, which just don't keep water hot enough, so the result was a very weak brew.

I'd love to give the chef some practical advice on how to improve the tea experience that is cognizant of their level of staffing and cost (they're not going to be able to have servers refill and serve everyone's tea pre-brewed, for example). The first idea that came to mind is those hot water dispensers that keep water at a relatively constant temperature. I've never personally used one, though so I'd love feedback from people who have. If they were used to fill the teapots, would that provide true boiling water for attendees to brew their cups? 

Ideally you'd also be brewing the tea in the pots, but I think they're trying to keep the pots just to water so people can try different teas without creating the need for servers to constantly wash out teapots in between. What other ideas do you have or have you seen for something like this? Because they're operating out of an event space and not a restaurant they are somewhat hampered in terms of options.

He lives with my mother and stepdad in the house next to them. A few months ago I was here for 2 weeks and I gave him some more attention because he is old and he felt like a grandfather. 

I don’t know what went wrong but at one point he came up to me and said “you know, I am so happy about our relationship, what are your friends saying about this?” I panicked, laughed a bit, walked away and called my mom and said that I feel like we need to have a conversation with him. 

Half an hour later he came again, sat next to me, touched my back and but and said “I am so happy that you are my girlfriend” I completely panicked again, walked away and locked the door. Called my mother. Long story short, I left, my mother lost it towards him, I was extremely triggered because I have allot of trauma’s and also sexual trauma and I really trusted him. I never went back to the house of my mother and stepdad untill yesterday. 

Today he eventually saw me and called me. My mom went with me and he apologised. But I am starting to think he is getting dementia. Because he is so.. I don’t know how to describe it. He truly is sorry but its almost like he doesn’t really understand what happened. 

A few more things on why I think he is slowly getting demtia: 2 weeks ago he was in the hospital because of his copd and he was having blackouts and could barely breath. They removed his watch and gave him a deep puncture in his wrist. He asked multiple times where his watch was and asked what happened. They told him he couldn’t drive his car anymore, my mom took his keys and today he said that he thinks he will drive his car again. He has to be on oxygen 24/7 and they told him it wont get better but today he said “oh well they will remove it eventually”. My mother asked him to shave his face in the hospital so she brought his stuf. The next day he told the staf that he couldnot shave because he didn’t have his stuff. 

After he apologised he asked my mother to buy cake and coffee.. idk how to feel. Idk what to think. Any thoughts are welcome at this point. I feel so confused ",1,1765208676.0,dementia,1,1.0,False

Now its a fun and joy instead of routine.

[keepapp.lovable.app](http://keepapp.lovable.app/)

I have been doing photography for already 10 years. And always complaining, like WHY no one created a simple, quick app that automatically drops photos from my SD card into the SSD the moment i choose the folder (because it is more attractive to create rockets or AI apps), but we truggle for simple things) . And at least keeping the dates is enough. I always felt frustrated of heavy lightroom with its subscription, either apps without proper image preview or the small things i do really need. In addition i hate when there is no smart camera settings that creates folder for different dates. So you have to always

0. find the proper DCIM folder  
1. go sort by date  
2. do finger motorics to copy  
3. copy and then create folder  
4. Past images

So I had the dumb silly idea of putting a couple of line of sugar on a coffee table like it's cocaine , I took a picture with my buddy with thumbs up and a big smile, posted on Facebook with the caption ""one way or another I am having a snowy Christmas lol 😉😉"" 

I knew some people wouldn't get the joke, some people would say it's bad joke but it's 2025 people get offended no matter what you do so live a little and stop worrying over everything, and just as I thought some didn't get the joke some didn't like it and some laughed.

  
Went to work the next day and I was little worried my boss would say something, I forgot half of my coworkers know my Facebook account but nothing no one said a thing, 3 days goes by and I completely forgot about it until I got called by HR.

I sit there and without a single a word she pulls out a printed screenshot of my post, tells she wants to talk about this, I tried telling her it was a bad low effort humour but she tells ""we know you were trying to make a joke, that's why I want to talk to you about this"" and goes on telling drugs are not a topic to joke about, people lose their lives and families fall apart because of this, you make inappropriate comment or a joke on the internet and move on with like nothing happened but people in the internet are people just like you and me and some people had a very bad experience with subtenses in the past or the current present and told me her older brother struggled with methamphetamine addiction for many years and even though he recovered and went sober not everyone had the luxury of a happy ending , and eventually reminded drugs are very illegal in Australia and they are very dangerous, and they company doesn't associat themselves with this kind of humour and therefor they made the decision to end my employment with them.

I can't blame them tbh.



Tldr : i made a silly joky post on Facebook about doing drugs and HR gave me a long lecture on doing drugs isnt humorous matter and they fired me because they don't associate themselves with that kind of inappropriate humour and doing dangerous illegal activities.",14,1765208570.0,tifu,22,0.72,False

You can text for days, have great banter, swap photos, whatever and then meet in person and within five minutes know it’s a no. Or the opposite happens: someone who seemed “just okay” on paper ends up being amazing once you’re actually across the table from them.  
  
That’s why I’ve been gravitating toward anything that gets people off their phones and into real life faster. Some matchmaking services like Tawkify and others basically skip the endless chatting and just set up a face-to-face introduction. And honestly, that approach makes sense. Chemistry isn’t something you can swipe for. It’s something you feel in the first ten seconds.  
  
There’s something grounding about meeting without all the pre built expectations. No curated photo dumps, no comparing prompts, no overthinking every message. Just two people showing up as themselves to see if anything clicks.  
  
And at 40+, that’s kind of the only way I want to do things. Life’s too busy to spend weeks messaging someone only to realize the energy’s off in person. A quick coffee or a short date tells you way more than any profile ever could.

1phfmgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BuggedNoMore/comments/1phfmgn/how_to_identify_common_household_pests_a/,How to Identify Common Household Pests: A Homeowner’s Guide,"As a homeowner, it's essential to be aware of the pests that can invade your home and the signs of their presence. Early identification of pests can save you time, money, and the headache of dealing with a full-blown infestation. Below, we’ll walk you through how to identify some of the most common household pests, the signs of their presence, and what steps you can take to address them.

1. Ants

Ants are one of the most common household pests. They can be small and range in color from black to red or brown. Carpenter ants, which are larger and more destructive, may be black or red and are known for damaging wood structures. You can often spot ants in a line, marching to and from a food source. Other signs include ant trails near windows, doors, or sinks, or small piles of sawdust if carpenter ants are nesting in wood. If you see ants, especially in large numbers, it's important to identify their entry point and seal it. In some cases, using ant baits or contacting a professional pest control service may be necessary.

2. Cockroaches

Cockroaches are not only unpleasant but also carry various diseases. Common species like the German cockroach are small, light brown, and have two dark parallel stripes running down their back. American cockroaches, on the other hand, are larger and reddish-brown. They are often seen in kitchens, bathrooms, or basements, especially at night. Signs of cockroaches include droppings that look like black pepper or coffee grounds, egg casings (small, brownish, cylindrical cases), and an oily or musty odor. If you spot a cockroach during the day, it often means there’s a larger infestation nearby. Sealing cracks and using baits or traps can help control cockroach populations.

3. Bedbugs

Bedbugs are small, flat insects that feed on human blood. They are usually brown or reddish-brown and about the size of an apple seed. Bedbugs often hide in cracks, crevices, or furniture seams during the day and come out to feed at night. If you wake up with red, itchy bite marks in a row or cluster, it could be a sign of bedbugs. You may also see small bloodstains on sheets or dark spots of bedbug feces. The best way to confirm a bedbug problem is to carefully inspect your mattress, box spring, and furniture for bedbugs or their eggs. Professional treatment is often necessary to fully eliminate them.

4. Termites

Termites are destructive pests that feed on wood, often causing significant damage to your home’s structure. Signs of termites include small holes in walls or wood, a hollow sound when tapping on wooden surfaces, and the presence of termite wings near windowsills or doors. You might also notice a sawdust-like substance, called frass, which is actually termite droppings. Since termite damage is often hidden within walls or floors, it’s crucial to schedule regular inspections, especially if you live in an area known for termite activity.

5. Rodents (Mice and Rats)

Rodents are another common household pest that can cause damage to your property and pose health risks. Mice are typically small with gray or brown fur, while rats are larger and often brown or black. Both mice and rats leave behind droppings that resemble small, dark pellets. Additionally, you might hear scratching noises in the walls or ceiling, particularly at night, as rodents are nocturnal. Rodents can also chew through wires, insulation, and food packaging. If you see signs of rodents, it’s important to seal up entry points and eliminate food sources. Setting traps or calling a pest control service may be necessary.

6. Spiders

Spiders are usually harmless but can be unsettling. Common household spiders, like the house spider, are small, brown, and often found in corners or other hidden places. The black widow and brown recluse are more dangerous and can be identified by their distinctive markings, such as the red hourglass on a black widow’s abdomen. Spiders create webs, often in dark corners or near windows. If you notice webs in places where they shouldn’t be, or you see a spider with unusual markings, it’s important to address the infestation promptly to avoid bites.

**Conclusion**

Identifying common household pests early is key to preventing an infestation. Keep an eye out for signs such as droppings, wood damage, or visible insects. Regular cleaning, sealing entry points, and maintaining your home’s integrity can help keep pests at bay. If you’re unsure or notice signs of a more serious infestation, it’s always a good idea to consult a pest control professional for a thorough inspection and treatment. By staying vigilant and taking prompt action, you can protect your home from pests and the damage they cause.",1,1765208482.0,u_BuggedNoMore,0,1.0,False

1phff49,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/1phff49/my_nutritionist_said_she_was_proud_of_me_for/,My nutritionist said she was proud of me for finally trying new foods,"I've been working with my nutritionist for five years now. She's great at what she does. She knows a lot about anorexia and how anorexia impacts your health and nutrition. When I get ready to have a session with her, I feel better about myself. She's empathetic, smart and when she feels I need to hear the harsh truth about something, she will tell me. I've told her how much I appreciate her helping me. I've never connected with other nutritionists I worked with. This nutritionist is not only an interesting person, but it feels like she truly cares about my situation, my difficulties and why recovery is challenging for me

This year, I have stepped outside of my comfort zone. I have tried several new foods. Which is probably one of the most difficult things for me to do. My diet is often limited. And I generally only eat certain brands and flavors. When I first started working with my nutritionist, she suggested I add new foods to my diet. Or try new food combinations together. I listened to her advice, yet it took a while to finally apply this to myself. I have found that the more I explore new foods, the less scary it is. And the more accomplished I feel

It's fine to have favorite foods, and if you do happen to feel anxious at the thought of trying a new food, there's nothing wrong with that. Lots of us feel that way. Accomplishing a goal, trying a new food, trying to change the time you eat every day, adding a new ingredient to a meal you enjoy, is not a change that happens overnight. I slowly introduced new foods back into my diet. I slowly altered the times I eat each day. I reminded myself that if it doesn't work out, if I try something and dislike it. I always have my old foods to go back to

Having everything predictable may feel comfortable. But by keeping everything the same, you never grow as a person. You could miss out on new experiences, because you never allow yourself to experience them. Though anorexia makes you feel like you have to live your life by rules, remember that anorexia is not your friend. And it doesn't want what is best for you. Your family, treatment team, anyone in life that cares about you, wants what is best for you

Anorexia wants to keep you sick, suffering, worrying, anxious

But you are allowed to rewrite the rules anorexia made for you. You are not a bad person if you go against them

I go over how I have improved, because it allows me to feel better about myself. Do I still feel anxiety whenever I sit down to eat a meal? Yes. I do. But some days, I can push the anxiety to the back of my mind and actually enjoy food. Other times, I can't outrun the anxious thoughts. I worry about weight gain. And I need to check my weight

My nutritionist said she was happy I was only weighing myself once a week now, instead of every single day. The pattern I was stuck in for years

By becoming more creative with my meals, adding new foods, and learning to relax more, I have found that:

1. A new food that you have never tried before doesn't have to be scary or cause you anxiety. You may try it and it may become one of your favorite foods. If you do not try the new food, you will never know what you are missing out on

2.If you like certain foods like sandwiches or pizza or pasta, you can make the meal more interesting by changing up the ingredients, adding a new flavor to these meals. This was one of the most difficult things for me to do. But I realized by mixing up the ingredients, actually adds more flavor and variety. Again, new doesn't have to mean bad. While I still have times where I have to prepare my food a certain way, I am also more open to the idea of adding a new ingredient when I want to experience a different flavor

3. Going back to your childhood, by eating favorite desserts or snacks you used to enjoy, before the eating disorder. This is helpful to me, because it reminds me of the times where I was not anorexic and chose food, based on what sounded good. Not because the food was low fat. This is a helpful way to lessen the anxiety around what you are eating. Reminding yourself that once upon a time, you did enjoy eating, without worrying about gaining weight. You are allowed to feel that freedom and that joy again. Even if you are not fully recovered from anorexia yet

4. It may take a few tries, or a long time, before you are able to branch out, switch up your eating routine, add new foods, or feel comfortable with doing something differently from the way you normally do them. Recovery is not a race. You should be patient with yourself and your treatment team should be patient with you. If something feels too overwhelming, and you can't make the change that day, it's okay. You can try another time

5. There were places I used to love to go out to eat, before anorexia. A favorite diner, bakery, coffee place. For years, I forgot how much I liked these places and avoided them. I recently when out to eat at a place I really liked, before the anorexia. My dad said he was so proud of me. I remind myself that, yes, I can change. I can challenge the anorexia. 

These are just some things I can think of, but creating a list of positive things helps me to feel better about how far I have come

It is not easy, by any means, to live with or get better from an illness like anorexia

If you are trying to reduce the amount of times that you weigh yourself, that is trying

If you are still attending your doctor, therapy and nutrition appointments, that is trying

If you are remaining optimistic and hopeful, no matter how badly you may be currently struggling with ed thoughts or behaviors, that is trying

And you should be proud

Simple stuff.
Drinking a coffee and actually tasting it.
Having a real conversation without rushing or faking it.

Moments that feel calm instead of sharp.

I used to react fast.
I used to jump to conclusions.
I used to feel like I needed an opinion on everything.
My mind always felt loud.

Now I feel quieter.
Not silent.
Just steady.
I can listen without planning my next line.
I can take a breath before I respond.
I can let things be what they are.

I never thought sobriety would give me that.
I thought it would just take away alcohol and leave a big empty space.
Instead it gave me this calm way of moving through the world that still surprises me.

# Introduction

A lot of times we come on here and tell people *who* we want when we should be telling them *what* we want. A beautifully painted picture of what the day-to-day looks like as well as those more fun times. So, with that being said, here is the picture of the life I want.

# Partnership in Monotony

We're adults, working 5+ days a week just to put food on the table and reach our mutual and individual goals. There goes 40-60 hours of our time together, and we have to remove those pesky 56 hours to get 8 hours of sleep per night if we're lucky. So, we have 52-72 hours left. 52-72 hours approximately to do everything else for ourselves, our families, friends, hobbies, and us.

Wow, that's a tight window!

Yet, we have a superpower. We are a *team*.  Sitting down together after dinner and working spreadsheets, Notions, shared Google calendars, and scribbling plans together is a whole DATE. Sipping on decaf because it's too late for caffeine while we laugh about how the weekend or next week is going to be a mess. Leaning over and giving each other little kisses and looking into one another's eyes with that neurodivergent depth that reads the slight discomfort in your right knee from that gym incident when you were 19.

If we're not doing that, we're sitting on our Discord server planning roleplays and story ideas for us to work on together. Then, we have to laugh because we've been planning this RP for like 4 days and we really should just jump into it but it's OK. Then we might jump into one and spend hours just poking at each other's brains with these great stories that stimulate us mentally and emotionally. If we're not RPing, we're watching a show/movie, gaming together or parallel playing, or maybe you're watching me or I'm watching you game on stream! Could be any of those.

There's always room for silence too.

God, how hard is it for people to sit in silence? Not us. We sit in silence, doing our thing, scrolling our phones. We bump legs or we're sitting on a call just listening to the background noise. Every now and then one of us goes ""I love you"" and the other goes ""forever and always.""

Maybe it's ""Dude, you're going to let the streak die. Send me something.""

Definitely it's us planning our next trip to see each other which eventually becomes planning our move-in, then it becomes planning our dates or trips together. The years passing one by one as we watch each other get older but our connection grows deeper.

Eventually it's not just us, now it's waking up at 2 AM to inconsolable crying as we both sigh and one of us takes our turn to feed our little munchkin.

The days become watching our family grow older and bigger. Visiting family. Family visiting. Traveling together. Sending grandma and grandpa picture of their munchkins and their tired kids who are learning to be parents.

Yet, we still sit together after dinner. Just now with kids joining us. Reading together. Gaming together. Teaching them about writing and narrative structure and all that. Listening to them tell us about their hobbies and all the latest fun things and us having to study because we're getting older and we are starting to ""live under a rock"".

# The Excitement of Certain Times

When we both manage to get out of being homebodies, that's also a great time.

I don't know about you, but I love getting dressed to the 20s (the 9s is too little). Perfect outfit. Perfect perfume. Even the choice of lotion is well decided. Then... We pull up to a great reservation... Somewhere simple.

God, do I hate those super expensive places that serve you three shreds of food and you're left wanting.

Let's go get tacos then roll up to a private lounge where you need a reservation a month out just to have a few drinks and little bites. Then we step out and walk down the street along the way stopping at an antique book store before noticing there's an ice cream shop next door.

Now, I love smoking cigars (not every day obviously), so you push me along to our reservation at the cigar lounge. We pull up, hugs and kisses as per Hispanic protocol to our friends who are staff. We take our seats, order our drinks, listen to the live music, and you can watch me light my cigar with patience which shows why you love me. Maybe you'll be the type of partner that joins me in smoking a cigar (if you're not that's OK).

We have to be constantly remembering to take pictures and selfies otherwise there's never a darn record that we went out or did anything. Always more preoccupied with the vibes and capturing the landscapes that ourselves.

The conversation is always great between us as we laugh and chat, even texting the things we can't say aloud as we plan the end of the evening.

# The ""Me to You""

# Important Details (PLEASE READ)

My main key point is that I don't care WHO you are or WHAT you look like or WHAT you're into so long as you see yourself fitting into this picture I have painted.

Every detail I wrote is important to me. There is nothing there that I can really compromise on without compromising myself and what makes my life happy to live and future worth working toward.

However, let's be clear about some of the following...

**Big details...**

* I am open to online/long-distance so long as we are BOTH putting in the work it takes
* I am only interested in cis(female) or transmale partners since I would like to start a biological family at some point
* I am NOT interested in potential partners that already have children, though potential exception may be made for those parents with children 13 years-old or older AND still healthy enough to have more children
* I am only interested in those in the United States at this point (this is due to international travel being more difficult due to my job)
* If you are NOT in the United States and STILL wish to try at this, please know that YOU will have to try to visit me instead of the other way around until I figure out the logistics of visiting your country with my job

**More about you...**

* You have a job
* You take care of yourself (e.g. if you have a medical condition you are actively treating it, you attend therapy if applicable, etc.)
* Co-habitation, long-term commitment, and having kids does NOT scare you and is a decided fact for you (not saying right off the bat but once the years pass and we reach each step), if you are unsure about any of those then maybe this isn't for you (and that's OK)

# Misc. Personal Facts (in more detail)

**Medical History**

I am formally diagnosed with...

* *Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) (26 years)* \- This is the insulin-dependent brand of diabetes which I treat through insulin-pump therapy on a closed-loop system using a continous glucose monitor (CGM)
* *ADHD (probably lifelong)* \- This I found out earlier this year after having to fight for an adult diagnosis. I have garden variety ""inattentive"" ADHD and I medicate it sometimes when I am going through very stressful, high octane periods using a non-stimulant (so no Addy)
* *Rosacea* \- A lovely auto-immune-based skin condition that causes redness at the cheeks and is treated using some creams
* *Hashimoto's* \- A thyroid condition which typically causes lower-than-normal thyroid hormone production and is ultimately treated using hormone supplementation. I am not yet at that point since my thyroid is still functioning normally. This is also auto-immune in nature.

**Sleep Tendencies**

I typically sleep from 10-11 PM to around 7-8 AM on the delightful ""right"" side of the bed (meaning the right from the foot of the bed, left side if you're laying in it). I am a side sleeper who has a whole position which involves a few extra pillows for my arms to be comfy. Soft, cooling sheets and blankets are a NECESSARY part of my sleep along with a ceiling fan on full blast and the temperature at 68 degrees F or lower (20 degrees C). I will lovingly cuddle you for a bit then we both eff off to either side of the bed and we sweetly touch our butts together or we cross ankles. Random cuddles will occur at checkpoints through the night as my T1D wakes me up for the mandatory ""am I dying"" checks.

If I wake up first, don't be surprised if I leave the bed to go get my day started. I will happily return to cuddle you awake at your self-designated wake up time (or when you come looking for me hugging a pillow and whining). Fair game!

**Meals and Food**

I do not like most sea food (though I do love conch fritters, fried shrimp, swordfish, mahi mahi, and a few other odd items). No, I will not share a sea food boil with you. Yes, I will pay for it, get it for you, and deliver it safely into your hands with a loving kiss. Yes, you can keep it all to yourself.

I eat a very light breakfast every morning with my mandatory Cuban *cafe con leche* because otherwise I will start softly cursing in Spanish as I brood around. A have a light to medium lunch between 11 AM and 1 PM, then I have an early dinner around 6 to 7 PM (to avoid blood sugar spikes in the night).

I also have mandatory coffee breaks mid morning around 9:30 AM to 10 AM and around 3 to 4 PM. Yes, I will also make you a beautiful pour over with fresh ground, locally sourced coffee. Yes, I love you too.

**Hygiene**

Daily showers for me are important, once to twice a day depending on level of activity. This includes a ceramide-based face wash along with some skin-care (yes, I do skin care and yes we can do it together; face masks!).

I have very sensitive skin so I do not shave, trimming is the best I can do. Even if I could, the moustache and short facial hair stays otherwise I look like I'm 15. Baby face will be stupidly beneficial in my 40s.

Electric toothbrushes, water picks, and standard string floss are goated. Just saying.

Perfume. Ah, perfume. Did you know that *I own over 100 perfumes* ranging from Eau de Toilettes to beautiful Extraits and Parfums? Yes, I also buy some Bath & Body Works stuff. Yes, we can go together. Also yes, I will go to Sephora with you and you can shop for make up while I sniff smelly water in the perfume section.

**Love Languages**

My main trio is:

1. Quality Time (this includes parallel play)
2. Acts of Service
3. Physical Touch and/or Words of Affirmation (it kinda flips around the two depending on distance and how busy we are)

I am a little weird about:

* Receiving gifts - I have a 6 figure job and can afford to gift myself what I want so when people who work really hard give me gifts, I feel really bad they spent their money on me like that. You *can* buy me cafecitos and cortaditos. Those are cheap and make me very happy. :3

A little context, you can ask for more in case I leave something out, I currently live in Spain (I was born here while the rest of my family is from Bulgaria) with my sister and brother-in-law who also have a toddler. I won't be stating names since I don't really know whether my sister uses reddit (I think she doesn't). Both of our parents are deceased, my father passed in 2012 and my mother in 2018. I was still not an adult before I was left an orphan. We also have a step-brother from my mother's side, who I don't speak to much but we do get along. And a step-brother from father's side who we don't talk to due to some stuff he pulled long ago which I don't know much, as I was still a child back then.

I will point out some situations that happened throughout the years of my father's passing until now.

\- After my father's passing (2012), both my mother (who was still alive) and my sister fell into depression. I wasn't allowed to grief as my step-brother, we'll call him B, told me that I had to be their support and that they'd lean on me for comfort. Mind you, I was 11 years old. So I spent months surpressing my feelings, watching them get better, while I couldn't deal with my own stuff. Fast forward a little bit, I reach the point of breaking and I finally fall into the long awaited depression. I was left alone, nobody would come and check on me, care if I was eating food or not. I was sleeping during the day and gaming during the night which was the only thing that kept me ""sane"" at the time. Doctors then found my mother had a cancerigenous ball on her collarbone, meaning they had to operate as soon as possible. When she underwent surgery, I was scared to go and see her, since my father had died from the same disease after fighting it for less than a year. My sister began a big arguement about how I didn't care, how I was ungrateful, how childish, and immature I was. My mother tried to tell her to stop, but she kept going, which ended with me crying and locking myself up in my room, again. She never apologized. Only a few years ago, I remember she told me how I was surely fucked up and scared to check on our mother and that she never realized. She never said she was sorry for saying or doing that.

\- After my mother's passing (2018), I was left again with no option but to put aside my feelings. My sister had decided that her only comfort would be alcohol, which led her to become an alcoholic a year later after my brother-in-law was put in jail for something he didn't do. My sister and I were struggling, I was just graduated from High School, didn't have a job yet, and the only one providing was my sister with her mediocre salary, enough to survive every month. I tried my best to be her pillar and comfort, to the point I started hiding the bottle of alcohol from her and be the one to pour her however much she needed, ending up on finishing the whole bottle either way because I was scared to say no. I was freshly 18 here. Every night she got drunk, it would end in an arguement. She would either say how ungrateful I was, again, how I hadn't found a job yet, how I wasn't even trying, how I was not making friends or being sociable, how I didn't have a boyfriend (there's a point coming for this soon), etc. One night it ended with her telling me I would never have friends and be lonely forever, and that I no longer mattered to her, that I was not her sister anymore. That I should return everything she had bought me and that this roof would be over my head till the day I find a job and leave. That totally broke me as she was the only person I had left and that day I truly realized I had myself only. I told her to leave my room, to which she realized how she had fucked up but left anyways. The following morning, she acted as if nothing had happened, I acted as if she wasn't around. She didn't apologize. She just took me to a chinese restaurant since I wanted to eat chinese food 3 days prior to said arguement, hoping that would ""mend"" the incredible fuck up she had created. Despite me ""forgiving"" her to keep my relationship with her, it still makes me see her in a different light. Around the beginning of 2019, my step-brother moves from our home country to our place to get a better life and bring his mistress/girlfriend with him later on. He stayed with us for half a year or so, where both my sister and brother would get drunk together and get into arguements every. single. night. Which led me to develop undiagnosed anxiety and insomnia, along with a few panic attacks back then, making me call my 2 best friends in the middle of the night while crying hysterically, wanting to calm down. Even when I told her I have anxiety, she would tell me ""You don't even know what having that feels like."" And completely dismiss me.

\- My brother-in-law and sister's wedding (2014). There isn't much here as it was a beautiful ceremony. But it's the part where, ever since they got together a year prior, I never liked my brother-in-law which I told my sister about in multiple ocassions. I never thought it would be a good idea to get together as my BIL seemed to have some issues with lending big amount of money (around the hundreds) to people he knew would never give them back, and all of that without consulting it with my sister first. Apart of that, he has a very misoginistic view towards women, which has gotten worse through the years. Or maybe he had it since before but it was starting to be obvious to me after I started paying more attention to his comments. Apart from that, he is homophobic and somewhat racist. Comments he has made regarding me and my weight:  
  
""She's like an elephant."" (He used to say this to me back when I was 12 years old.)  
""We would need a crane to lift you up.""  
""I will sign you up to this survival show next year.""  
""You can take the whole pot of pasta, don't pour in a plate.""

And many more regarding my failed attempts to be in a diet, where he kept constantly commenting about my food every time I sat down to eat. I would usually eat fried eggs, salads, some pasta in small quantities, rice, stuff that was supposed to be healthy in smaller quantity than the amount I used to eat. It led me to the point of stress eating, crying after every comment he made, and hiding whenever I ate. Despite managing to lose 10 kg and going from 85kg (187lbs) to 74kg (163lbs), I fell back and gained the weight again. Now, I am overweight, I'm not obese. I have struggled with weight due to stress, depression, and so many other things that have made it impossible for me to focus on being healthy or ""looking good"". So giving an effort and getting met by such comments made me feel useless and shitty to the point I didn't even want to look at myself in the mirror. I started being self-conscious about how I looked and began to wear more open clothing, like, sweatpants, hoodies, oversized shirts, less dresses, shorts, tight shirts, etc. During this, my sister would tell me that I'm too sensitive and shouldn't take it to heart, that I am too emotional, and that I just shouldn't pay attention to him, while saying nothing to him. Until it was her turn to take the comments when she decided to lose weight after her pregnancy and realized how fucked up it feels. Again, she never apologized or told him to stop/apologize either.

\- I don't remember when this arguement took place exactly as it was too much and I guess my brain decided to erase most of it for my sake. I think it was before COVID hit. I had told my sister I wanted to do Youtube as a hobby while browsing for jobs, hoping it would maybe become succesful someday or that I'd find a job in the meantime. I began to show her some of the videos, the views and subscribers I had already gained (she was drunk at this time btw) and how well it was going. She then out of nowhere asked me how my job seeking was going. I told her I had been seeking jobs but it was hard for me to find anything as I had no experience and no degree either, so it was harder to find something. Let me tell you that she was introduced into working thanks to my mother, who worked in transport and got my sister a spot when she was just 17 years old. I was thrown into looking for a job with no help or guidance whatsoever, so I didn't know what I was doing. And despite looking for a job and signing up for some I thought I'd be good at, I would end up with no response back. The arguement escalated where she, yet again, called me ungrateful, immature, stupid, etc. I went to my bedroom and she followed, repeating how I no longer meant anything to her and how she didn't want a lazy person like me in her house. She took my phone, computer, PS4 (stuff she had bought) and tried to take my Nintendo. But I snatched it from her hands, to which she raised hers to slap me but I pushed it away, telling her that I wouldn't allow her to hit me. The Nintendo was a gift from my friends I had managed to make after they moved to the town we live in so it was technically mine. She then left the room and even changed the password to the WI-FI. I was left alone, crying, shaking, and with no contact with my friends to seek comfort from. I had told my BIL to calm her down and tell her to leave me alone after he got back from work right after the arguement started, but he gave 0 fucks and acted as if nothing happened.

\- Both my BIL and sister have the tendency of embarrasing me in front of others, the reason why I don't hang out with them anymore. We tend to have some family friends or coworkers of my sister and BIL over sometimes, since they invite them to come over and have some drinks/dinner. When I used to hangout with them, both my sister and BIL would chime in (mostly my BIL) to remark how fat I was, how I never had a boyfriend and should find me one, and mock me of a remark I've made which sounded dumb to them but my friends would agree with me about said remark, my best friend even found it odd that they would mock me for said stuff. There was one time I was forced to meet one of their new acquaintances because the man wanted to meet me. He then offered me to have his daughter recommend me at her work place so I could go and win some good money there, to which I agreed. My BIL then, with his tiny nut brain, goes and says. ""I don't think she'll be able to pull of any job."" And proceeds to laugh. My sister surprisingly shot him a death stare while I wanted to die inside, but thankfully the man just ignored it and let me go back inside and to my room after that. I don't enjoy going out shopping with them either, because they criticize the things I get or how I spend my money, which I work my ass of for. I finally got my first job last year, which ended up being a horrible place since all the coworkers were turned against everyone and the boss did nothing, but it was a nice pay watsoever which let me buy my own PC, own PS5, even pay half of my phone's price before I was let off last September. And yes, I stopped asking my sister for money or stuff, since I don't want the whole ""Everything I bought you"" shit to happen again.

\- After they had their kid, they decided to start a small business together, which meant my sister would be working from home while my BIL is gone all day. Ever since he was born, I was around to help with everything. Feeding, diaper change, baths, putting him to sleep, entertaining him, looking after him when they needed to go out, etc. One of the constant arguements that would start from years ago till now and it's a must for my sister to have it at least thrice a year, every couple of months, is the fact that I supposedly don't do anything around the house. I break my back with doing dishes, vacumming, mopping, walking my dog, taking care of said toddler, laundry whenever it's needed or I'm asked for since the washing is on the second floor and my bedroom is in the basement (it's made like a separate apartment but I know it sounds funny considering the situation lmao), throwing the trash away, and basically leaving the house in a livable and safe space. I would even cook sometimes if needed. Now, my sister's work schedule means she's busy all day, which leaves me neglecting my own 'me' time, like learning guitar, having a job, focusing on my hobbies, etc. I spend almost all day with her kid, feeding him, putting him to sleep, going on walks with him, entertaining him, etc. Sometimes I tend to get mentally drained from the same cycle over and over again, which leads me to work on automatic and not really focus on what I'm doing. Sometimes I would do the dishes later than usual, I would clean the house a few days later than usual, would forget to throw the trash, would forget to do their laundry. Yes, their laundry. I do mine separately since last year. And then we would get my sister blowing up over the fact I didn't do the dishes that morning before I left for work, or didn't throw the trash away. She actually shamed me about this in front of some guests we had staying at another house when we went to visit them, saying how she took longer than expected because someone (me, in a mocking tone) had forgotten to do the dishes and throw the trash because I never do anything in the house, which led her to wait for the kid to take his nap before heading over. I was already running late to my job so I had to leave early, which her response is usually, ""Well, you should've gotten ready earlier then."". For context, my current job is house cleaning. I have a few places I clean, and the house I had to clean was in the same town these guests had rented their AirBnB for a week, so the woman invited me over for coffee once I was done. After hearing my sister's comment, I instantly jumped to defend myself as I have this year decided to finally stop letting them treat me this way, even if it starts another arguement about me responding in a gnarly way and always having it to be ""my way"" and always needing to ""be right"". I told her I had forgotten, yes, but I always took care of everything most of the time, even if late. The woman then looked at my sister and told her, ""It's okay that you had to do something instead, she's not your maid."" Which left my sister dumbfounded and me filled with joy. It was the first time, apart from my friends, that a grown-up had actually seen my side and finally stood up for me, even if partially. When we got back home, my sister told me that I should never reply to her that way in front of others ever again and that I should drop it when asked to. She did ask me to drop it to which I simply replied to with ""I was just standing up for myself."". The arguement started again, this time at home, about how I didn't do the chores and how I've been lacking. This time, I finally open up about how mentally drained I am and how difficult it is for me to function when I have a whole house and child on my back, to which she says is my responsability since I live with them. I tried to tell her that my best friend, who lives with her parents as well, share the chores. She does laundry, someone else cooks, and someone else cleans the house and does dishes. To which she said that I shouldn't compare their way since this is our house and it should be how she says. I tell her out of anger that if she wants me to be a maid, she should then pay me for it, as I am taking care of a house I share with other people, along with taking care of their child. The arguement ended with me being called ungrateful and told to move to my step-brother's place if I don't like living there, something they constantly keep repeating every time they lose an arguement or can't get their facts the way they want.

\- I will keep this point slightly short but I am open to answering any questions regarding this. I found out this January, after a long time of thinking I am bisexual and being pressured to finding a boyfriend (and trying in so many ways to get one but failing) that I am actually a Lesbian. I came out to my sister, which she didn't take nicely and said people with those ideas were not normal, that I haven't tried d\*ck so I didn't know if I didn't like it, etc. I have never been with a man, yes. But I have been abused (thankfully never r\*ped) by men and taken advantage of by men. Every time I thought of getting intimate with a guy made me uncomfortable and I felt anxiety spike whenever I got to set up a date with some guy that we never ended up going to due to other reasons. I basically told her that I was simply informing her of it and not seeking her approval, but they've kept dismissing it, and I'm honestly done explaining or arguing about it.

This is mostly what I remember for now. I am currently, like I said, cleaning houses which earns me a good amount of money to buy my own groceries and stuff whenever I want to. I am also currently focusing on becoming a musician, which is a long sought dream of mine that both of my parents had wanted for me but I gave up on since my BIL and sister kept diminishing it and saying I suck at singing, that I'd never make it big, etc. I am still working on my Youtube channel from time to time, managed to make it grow a little. And I am still on the lookout for an actual job in case cleaning doesn't becoming good enough. If I remember anything else or you need more context, I'll be here <3",0,1765207772.0,AITAH,0,0.5,False

This was almost 4 years after graduation and we barely put any effort to stay in touch until now. There were also some misunderstandings (created by the men in our lives, of course) that kept us apart and I’m so glad we finally sorted them out after sooo fucking long.

But this reconnection made me realise how important female friendships are on so many different levels.

For starters, she recommended me this amazing drink from a brewery near work and this was the first drink I actually finished in 3 years. And while I was telling her how amazing it was, she goes, “Bro we hated alcohol all this while because all we drank were drinks recommended to us by men.”

And honestly?? She’s right. No sane man would recommend vodka with coffee. But a woman tried something different, recommended it to my friend, and she recommended it to me — and it was AMAZING.

It might sound insignificant to some people, but it’s just such a perfect tiny example of how so many parts of our lives end up being shaped around what men suggest… without us even noticing.

Hello,

I usually lurk, am a fairly private person but I figured I would post this in hopes that it may inspire one of you as you've inspired me & I would like to pay it forward.

The beginning of this year cut me deep & made something in me snap. I'd always been the skinny guy in the group. However, I realized I was sliding hard into bad habits and was slowly but surely heading towards a negative cardiovascular event of some kind.

I decided to make a change for the better 6 months ago, and I feel better for having done so. I can run faster than I did in HS & lift harder than I did in my service.

*For reference I am 5'11 (180cm) & my starting weight was 213lbs (96kg) I am now 163lbs (73kg).*

**What I did/am doing:**

***- For the first 3-4 months I did 18:6 IF*** eating between 12pm & 6pm. I was at roughly a 500-600 calorie deficit for most of this time. At 6 months, I sort of still stick to this but not as stringently. I am now at my maintenance calories most days with some days in a deficit as it's hard to meet maintenance in an IF window sometimes. 

\- I ate my goal body weight in protein every single day & am still doing so now. I usually eat low fat, low carb high in protein meals.

\- I completely removed processed sugar from my diet which was extremely soul crushing & eye opening at first on how much I depended on sugar. I learned that the morning coffee wasn't what I was addicted to, but the sugar and creamer I was putting in it.

\- I have never missed a day walking 10-15k steps, I have truly found a love for walking. Since June I have walked a distance roughly akin to walking from Miami to Boston (around 9.5 miles a day)

\- 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep, no excuses

**My exercise routine:**

Monday: Chest Day, 10k steps

Tuesday: Rest/HIIT/10k steps

Wednesday: Leg Day, 10k steps

Thursday: Rest/HIIT/10k steps

Friday: Arm Day, 10k steps

Saturday: Rest/HIIT/10k steps

Sunday: 10k steps (Full Rest)

  
I don't recommend going cold turkey into the working out if this is something you'd like to mirror unless you know what you're getting yourself into. This is not my first rodeo when it comes to exercise and I was well aware of what it'd take to maintain this kind of consistency fitness wise. 

**Some inspirations that got me here:**

This sub, without seeing some of the transformations here I wouldn't have believed it could happen to me.

The book ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear. This book helped change the way I look at my goals and also myself. I **HIGHLY** recommend it. Learning that it's the PROCESS to your goals that matters and the foundations in which you build them upon really pushed me forward.

1phf6ln,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1phf6ln/aitah_for_counting_my_own_time_at_work_after_my/,"AITAH for ""counting my own time at work"" after my boss called me ungrateful, when I'm saving for college.","LONG STORY AHEAD! PLEASE DON'T REPOST TO ANY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS!

F(18) working at a small coffee shop. Pay is ₱500 ($8.50) for 10hrs = ₱50/hr — no set breaks, only if there's no customers or if we're gonna eat which is less than 15mins.

 A while back, there was a concert nearby. Owner said we'd get double pay that day. We opened at 6am and closed at 3am (21hrs total). On payday, she only gave me ₱1,000 ($17) — which is my regular salary with double pay (not double pay + OT like we thought). I asked why I was short ₱550 ($9.30) and she said it was too much for a small business, so i literally told her that, ""so basically it's not a double pay since it's like we worked it?"" she replied by saying ""you won't find a job that gives double pay on non-holidays."" I got my salary, my bag and went out. My coworkers then told me that she was in bad mood cus I left without checking the coffee and tea, which they emptied it cus there was a lot of customers and that when i left the shop, more customers went, which is not my fault because im not there anymore.

That’s when I decided to confront her privately first — I typed out everything I’d done before leaving that day: inventory on cups, making extra tapioca, checking coffee and tea levels which is btw 8liters cus the container can only hold 10liters, reminding the others about the old coffee that needed to be thrown out after their shift if it still has, and making sure the cash matched. I even told her the real reason I left early: my OT window was only 12 minutes left, and she’d already said sales were only 1k so OT wouldn’t be possible anyway. I didn’t want to impose. Her reply hit hard. She said an hour of waiting wasn’t even real OT, that she knew our pay, and asked if I couldn’t give “charity” with my time sometimes. Then she went back to the gc and doubled down — said it was disappointing to have someone ungrateful, that if we counted every minute we shouldn’t work there because it’s a small business with no contracts.

I couldn’t stay quiet anymore. I typed back in the gc, telling her I am grateful, that I did stay late without pay before (from 4:30pm out to 5:18pm), that I really do count my time because I’m saving for college. I even brought up the concert day — how we worked 21 hours, how she called it double pay but shorted me 550 pesos, and how she’d labeled it “demand” when I just asked for what was promised.
 
All she said in response was that the double pay thing was “unclear,” that they couldn’t afford double pay + OT, and that they’d just pay me for 11 hours of that day. No apology, that she’d called me ungrateful for something I didn’t do. All I wanted was to be treated fairly — to have my work recognized, my time respected, and promises kept. Calling it “family” then throwing “ungrateful” in my face when I ask for what’s right. She just said the double pay was ""unclear"" and would pay me for 11hrs of that day.
 
Now I'm wondering if I'm the AH for being strict about my hours and bringing up the pay issue.

Last year I told my mom we would make brand new flavours since our four classics (peppermint candy cane, cocoa powder, coconut, and scor) were getting old fast. But it’s turned out this is the first year we won’t be together for Christmas since I left home a couple years ago and she’s touring. so mom and I decided to scrap the plan but this morning I woke up really sad and decided I wanted to do them anyway and make them the best we’ve ever done. Trouble is: I’m not great at innovating. So here are my ideas (I’m one short) please let me know your thoughts. I’m no chocolatier and I’d rather them be good than sentimental.

1. Captain orange (inspired by my uncle, dad and mom)
An orange and rum infused half dark half milk truffle topped with a candied orange peel. 

2. Iced Tea (inspired by my Aunt and Grandma)
A earl gray mint and honey infused dark chocolate truffle with a mint leaf as garnish.

3. Blood on the Clocktower (for the game that saved my life this year)
A half cherry with a dark chocolate bourbon coating and a drizzle of milk chocolate topped with bits of maraschino cherry.

4. Morning Coffee (for all the times my dad wouldn’t let us open presents till after he finished his coffee) 
A coffee infused milk chocolate truffle with cocoa powder and a dark chocolate foot. 

5. Dusty mountains (for my brother Nathan) 
Lime and coconut infused milk chocolate truffle dusted with fine bits of coconut. 

6. Red Wedding (for my brother Eric and his wife) 
A dark chocolate covered raspberry truffle with white chocolate and pistachios on top. 

7. Something Nutty (for my third brother his wife and their new baby) 
A salted caramel pecan truffle topped with a whole pecan. (Dark chocolate)

1phf0eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/enmeshmenttrauma/comments/1phf0eh/enmeshment_with_sister_and_mom/,Enmeshment with sister and mom?,"So I think my mom (61F) and sister (30f) are enmeshed. Ive gone to several years of therapy and no one has brought it up before. I just don’t know if they fit the typical criteria but I could be wrong and just not seeing it. They live right next door to one another, see each other every day, eat dinner together most nights, do most errands together, talk 100x day. My stepdad also participates to some degree. My mom is emotionally immature but so is my sister. 

My sister is self centered and manipulative, expects everyone to be inconvenienced for her at the drop of a hat whether it be babysitting or running an errand with her. I feel like my sister is responsible for majority of the phone calls and the dinners or the errands. She will ask for someone to come over and do a puzzle with her, it seems like she can’t do anything alone without my mom. I do enable the behavior because she acts the same way with me (28f), wants me over there all the time and uses me wanting to see my nephew as a reason. And she’s not wrong, I do want to see him. But then she makes me watch him which is not what I came over for. I guess I’m unsure if this is the typical dynamic, because it seems like it’s the parent initiating most of the time? Or is it just a result of childhood upbringing/trauma that she acts the way she does? My mom did always over share and rely on us emotionally, but she talks about how my sister annoys her all the time, and she basically still will do whatever my sister asks. (That is also where I’m confused, I guess). My dad was abusive to some extent if that is relevant. 

I do feel resentful/ a bit jealous because on the small chance I ask for my mom’s time she tells me she’s busy with my sister or nephew, or she will bail on a plan we did make. I’ve vocalized several times that this is hurtful because I don’t ask for much-even just to go out for an occasional coffee every couple of months, but I’ve always been independent and my sister has always been attention seeking. Is it normal to emotionally ignore (I guess?) the other people in your life? I guess I thought they acted the same way with all of their children if they had enmeshment tendencies. I got engaged recently and they (mom, sis, stepdad) would genuinely rather discuss how my nephews potty training is going. And they like my fiance, it’s not that at all. And I know it’s juvenile to be upset but it really sucks. My mom will then call crying and tell me how sorry she is. So is this enmeshment? Codependency? Am I contributing? Is my sister just insecure? Just toxic? or am I just the black sheep? Obviously don’t have to answer all of those I’m just feeling a little lost. ",2,1765207063.0,enmeshmenttrauma,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 3: Echoes of a Distant Hammer

*""The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.""*  
 —Carl Sagan

**\[Year 2035 — Japan, Mount Ikenoyama\]**

The faint bluish glow of KAGRA's status screen reflected on the surface of the ceramic mug Dr. Haruka Takahashi cradled in her hands. The painted *maneki-neko(6)*, paw raised in a gesture of good fortune, felt like irony in the stillness of 4:00 a.m. beneath Mount Ikenoyama. The coffee—strong and black—was as much a ritual as it was a necessity. The lucky cat drew a bitter smile from her... *Fortune*? Years of study and work, of sacrifices, and quiet renunciations of other paths, other lives.

For a fleeting moment, she caught a glimpse of the life that could have been: a child's laughter in a home she would never know, the warmth of a family she had given up, sacrificed for the sake of uncovering cosmic secrets. She remembered the painful conversation with her mentor, Kenji Tanaka, years earlier, when he asked her with a father's gentleness if she was certain about the path she was choosing, a path that would eventually leave her alone.

""Yes,"" she had replied with the firm conviction of youth and scientific certainty. But sometimes, like now, she wondered if that conviction had also been a form of blindness. She had just turned thirty. Her meteoric career was built on nights like this, on solving differential equations in feverish dreams, and on the quiet renunciation of more conventional paths. Ghosts of an unchosen life, replaced by the cold love of science – an echo of personal desires drowned out by the universe's secrets. She shook her head sharply, pushing the melancholy away.

Today was no day for regrets. Today was the day. Her big day.

Hours later, KAGRA's control room buzzed with contained energy. The air carried the faint scent of ozone from electronics and the collective tension of dozens of scientists and engineers. Haruka moved among the consoles; her usual calm edged with barely concealed excitement. On one of the desks, a colleague's mug with a red circular sticker—an all-seeing eye and the words ""CHECK DIAGNOSTICS"" brought a quick smile to her face. 

The ""Takahashi Filter,"" as her colleagues had unofficially named her new set of quantum noise suppression algorithms, was about to face its decisive test. Almost everyone there understood the implications, though none voiced them. A Nobel Prize in Physics seemed almost a formality given the breakthrough's ramifications for understanding the universe. It would be historic. Haruka had spent years developing the mathematics, running simulations, and writing lines of code that promised to strip the universe's whispers clean of background noise, inherent to reality itself at infinitesimal scales. Today, KAGRA wouldn't just listen; it would listen with unprecedented clarity.

*""Final calibration sequence complete,""* informed a metallic voice from the speakers.

Haruka gripped the console's edge, feeling the plastic yield under her fingers. She breathed as Kenji had taught her: inhale... hold... exhale... empty. Then she looked up.

""*Mirrors stabilized. Lasers at nominal power. Initiating detection frequency sweep.""* The announcement silenced the murmurs, casting an expectant stillness over the room. Every eye was fixed on the main screen, where the interferometer data traced a jittery, fluctuating line. For minutes that felt like hours, the line remained mostly flat.

The control screen flickered with calibration sequences, but Haruka's mind drifted, if only for an instant, to another flicker: city lights mirrored in Akio's tearful eyes, five years ago.  
""I can't compete against the universe, Haruka,"" he had said, sadness and resignation entwined. ""Your stars and equations are more absorbing lovers than I will ever be.""

That last night had condensed every canceled dinner. Since then, her only loyalty had been to a sky that asked for no explanations.

""Holding sensitivity..."" murmured the operations director, his knuckles white on the console edge, pulling her back from her memories. A dead pixel crossed the graph. *Noise,* Haruka thought.

Then it happened: a ripple emerged from the baseline. At first, it was subtle, but it quickly grew in amplitude and frequency, forming a perfect upward curve; the unmistakable chirp of two massive objects locked in a death spiral. But this signal was different. Sharper. Cleaner.

""Detection! Clear signal!"" shouted a technician, spinning in his chair, eyes wide. ""Amplitude and frequency match the standard BH—BH(7) model! But look at that signal-to-noise ratio!""

The room broke into restrained celebration. There was applause, cheering, and a few work caps tossed into the air. Haruka felt a surge of pure euphoria. She allowed herself a brief, radiant smile as her mentor, Professor Kenji Tanaka, placed a hand on her shoulder.

""You did it, Haruka-chan,"" Tanaka said, his voice roughened by emotion. ""Congratulations! Your filter... it's as if we had been staring through a fogged lens and now that lens is perfectly clear.""

Kenji Tanaka felt a mix of professional pride and the familiar pang of the old sadness that always lingered beneath the surface. Haruka was, in many ways, the daughter science had given him after life took his own away. Twenty years had passed since a truck, faulty brakes and a rain-slicked road turned a family day out into tragedy. His little Yumi, just six, and his wife Akane had been gone in an instant. Fate had spared him, leaving physical scars and a shattered soul. Only the cold discipline of physics—and the promise of the young, brilliant Haruka—had kept him afloat. For him, Haruka's triumph was more than professional pride. It was a fragile redemption, proof that even from senseless cruelty, something luminous could still emerge.

""Thank you, *sensei*,"" Haruka replied, warmth pushing through her composure. ""It's a team effort, but... yes, it works.""

""Works?"" laughed Aoki, one of the senior physicists. ""It's computational black magic, Takahashi-san! LIGO and Virgo are going to turn green with envy.""

The celebration continued—modest but heartfelt—with *sake* shared in paper cups. Haruka, for a moment, let herself savor the victory and relax...

A week later, the initial euphoria had given way to scrutiny, and meticulous analysis. Alone again in the predawn quiet, Haruka cataloged the signal as GW2035-0114. The merger signal was perfect, almost textbook. But when she applied the deepest layers of her filter, scrubbing out the residual ""noise"" with a boldness no other protocol would dare to use, something still remained.

An artifact. A solitary pulse. Powerful. Strangely clean. Seconds before the main *chirp*. Like the echo of a hammer strike.

Hours became days. She ruled out instrumental glitches, calibration errors, software faults. The pulse persisted. She eliminated known astrophysical phenomena. No electromagnetic counterpart, no gamma-ray burst, no neutrino signal. A primordial dark matter event failed the tests. A cosmic string collapse didn't match. It was energetically immense, but gravitationally... pure. A week passed, double-checking every possibility and discarding them again.

Finally, with an icy certainty tightening her chest, she stood up from her desk and headed to Tanaka's office.

""Sensei, we need to talk,"" she said, her voice calm but with a hint of urgency beneath. 

She projected the filtered data onto the wall monitor, displaying the merger's beautiful rising curve and a separate, sharp pulse that stood out like heresy.

Haruka took a deep breath, gathering her thoughts before speaking.

""The main signal, GW2035-0114, originates from the Sculptor Galaxy, five hundred million light-years away. It perfectly matches the data from LIGO and Virgo,"" she began.  
""But this..."" she circled the preceding pulse in red. ""This doesn't. LIGO and Virgo barely register it; it's buried in their noise. But our filter, *sensei*... it isolates it. And its signature... its parallax... its direction... it's not from there.""

""Then, where?"" asked Tanaka, leaning forward, intrigue overriding initial skepticism.

Haruka swallowed.  
""It points to the constellation of Pictor. To the HD 40307 system.""

""No. Impossible,"" Tanaka said. ""HD 40307 is just forty-two light-years away. There's no way it could produce a pulse this strong without destroying half its system. And we'd see it with the telescopes.""

""Exactly,"" Haruka nodded. ""It's not natural. I've exhausted every astrophysical explanation. Only one hypothesis remains. Monstrous. It shatters all our cherished assumptions about the universe's Great Silence."" 

She looked at her mentor, hesitating... then forced the words.

""The only explanation that fits—the massive energy, the lack of electromagnetic counterpart, the direct trajectory from a nearby stellar system with no known cataclysmic events—is the signature of a technology that surpasses ours the way we surpass... chimpanzees. The trace of a... launch.""

Tanaka seemed to pale slightly.  
""A... launch? Of what?"" His voice still incredulous.

""Of something massive,"" Haruka said. ""Accelerated to a significant fraction of light speed. The math aligns perfectly. A propulsion event that huge would rip space-time apart, producing a gravitational wave like this one, moving at lightspeed, arriving years ahead of the object itself. It's like the muzzle flash of a gun. We haven't seen the bullet yet, but we've felt the shot.""

The room seemed to shrink, the air growing thick and hotter.

The lab—once a temple of knowledge—had become a watchtower from which the end was glimpsed.

""A... launch,"" Kenji repeated, the word sounding absurd on his lips. ""Haruka, even if the data are sound, inferring... intent, technology... from a single anomalous wave is almost a leap of... faith.""

""There's no act of faith involved, sensei,"" Haruka answered, her heart racing like a pulsar. She compared KAGRA data with LIGO and Virgo records, overlaying them to check for matches.

""It's a systematic elimination of impossibilities,"" she continued. ""Here,"" she pointed to faint fluctuations in LIGO and Virgo, ""it's just a whisper in their noise, but it's there. Synchronized with our pulse. The Takahashi Filter isolates and amplifies it.""

""Now, the triangulation."" A three-dimensional map of the Milky Way appeared, with the three observatories as nodes. Cones of probability extended from each one.

""A gravitational event creates a spherical wave. Arrival-time differences let us locate its origin,"" Haruka said. ""That timing difference is the key that allows us to triangulate its origin in the sky.""

""With events like GW2035-0114, the intersection is a broad patch of sky. But this solitary pulse..."" She zoomed in. The intersection collapsed into a point, implausibly precise.

""It doesn't point to the Sculptor Galaxy,"" she whispered. ""It points here."" The view plunged to a modest orange star: HD 40307.

""Fine,"" Tanaka conceded. ""The direction is precise, I'll grant you that. But the nature of the source is unknown. It could be a new type of pulsar, a quark star, a primordial black hole...""

Haruka shook her head.  
""I've modeled them all with the latest AI's help. None fit."" She projected a series of comparative graphs. ""Every known astrophysical event leaves a multi-messenger signature. Neutrinos, electromagnetic emission across the spectrum. All silent. This event is gravitationally loud but electromagnetically mute."" 

""A black hole evaporating would generate Hawking radiation, not this sharp, coherent pulse. The only physical mechanism that can produce a huge, purely gravitational, coherent signature, with no electromagnetic counterpart is... controlled massive acceleration of an object.""

She paused, letting the idea sink in.

""It's like a rocket, *sensei*. A rocket emits exhaust and noise, but the space-time change is caused by the rocket itself moving. This is that, but on a scale that makes our rockets look like... toys.""

A heavy silence settled.

""Even if it were artificial, Haruka,"" Kenji argued with little conviction, ""why assume it's a threat? It's just a direction in an indifferent sky.""

""Because of this,"" Haruka said, her voice now trembling.

She overlaid the gravitational wave's vector on a precise stellar map.  
""The pulse expands at lightspeed in all directions. We're in its path, just like countless other stars. But only for us..."" Her fingers flew. New data appeared. It was a Doppler(8) analysis of the pulse signal itself, showing how its frequency stretched or compressed.

""A stationary source wouldn't have a Doppler shift. But if it's moving away from or toward us, it would. I've analyzed it. There's a slight, measurable blueshift in the wavefront.""

""It's moving toward us,"" she murmured.

The data was absolute. Incontrovertible.

Kenji loosened his tie. The air conditioners *hum* suddenly seemed too loud. An arrow appeared on the map, tracing a trajectory from HD 40307 that crossed forty-two light-years to end, with surgical precision, on the solar system. On Earth.

There was no room for coincidence. It was deliberate.

Haruka felt the air thicken, as if the universe had turned to watch her. She felt the need to sit; her legs threatened to give way. Kenji slumped into his chair; color drained from his face. The logical defenses had crumbled. Astrophysics, mathematics, their most faithful allies—now conspired against them.

""You need irrefutable proof,"" he murmured. Not an objection—an appeal.

""I know,"" she said. ""We need to see it. I'll request time on JWST(9). We'll look for the infrared trace of its drive or reflected starlight off its hull. There has to be a bullet trailing the shot.""

# TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

>I’m a 30 M engineer from Miami who wants a teammate, someone to build an actual life with. Bilingual (English/Spanish), loyal, sarcastic, and probably overqualified for making you coffee in the mornings. Bonus points if you also think home ownership shouldn't count as an Olympic event.

Thanks, Gippity. *takes the mic back*

# Introduction

A lot of times we come on here and tell people *who* we want when we should be telling them *what* we want. A beautifully painted picture of what the day-to-day looks like as well as those more fun times. So, with that being said, here is the picture of the life I want.

# Partnership in Monotony

We're adults, working 5+ days a week just to put food on the table and reach our mutual and individual goals. There goes 40-60 hours of our time together, and we have to remove those pesky 56 hours to get 8 hours of sleep per night if we're lucky. So, we have 52-72 hours left. 52-72 hours approximately to do everything else for ourselves, our families, friends, hobbies, and us.

Wow, that's a tight window!

Yet, we have a superpower. We are a *team*.  Sitting down together after dinner and working spreadsheets, Notions, shared Google calendars, and scribbling plans together is a whole DATE. Sipping on decaf because it's too late for caffeine while we laugh about how the weekend or next week is going to be a mess. Leaning over and giving each other little kisses and looking into one another's eyes with that neurodivergent depth that reads the slight discomfort in your right knee from that gym incident when you were 19.

If we're not doing that, we're sitting on our Discord server planning roleplays and story ideas for us to work on together. Then, we have to laugh because we've been planning this RP for like 4 days and we really should just jump into it but it's OK. Then we might jump into one and spend hours just poking at each other's brains with these great stories that stimulate us mentally and emotionally. If we're not RPing, we're watching a show/movie, gaming together or parallel playing, or maybe you're watching me or I'm watching you game on stream! Could be any of those.

There's always room for silence too.

God, how hard is it for people to sit in silence? Not us. We sit in silence, doing our thing, scrolling our phones. We bump legs or we're sitting on a call just listening to the background noise. Every now and then one of us goes ""I love you"" and the other goes ""forever and always.""

Maybe it's ""Dude, you're going to let the streak die. Send me something.""

Definitely it's us planning our next trip to see each other which eventually becomes planning our move-in, then it becomes planning our dates or trips together. The years passing one by one as we watch each other get older but our connection grows deeper.

Eventually it's not just us, now it's waking up at 2 AM to inconsolable crying as we both sigh and one of us takes our turn to feed our little munchkin.

The days become watching our family grow older and bigger. Visiting family. Family visiting. Traveling together. Sending grandma and grandpa picture of their munchkins and their tired kids who are learning to be parents.

Yet, we still sit together after dinner. Just now with kids joining us. Reading together. Gaming together. Teaching them about writing and narrative structure and all that. Listening to them tell us about their hobbies and all the latest fun things and us having to study because we're getting older and we are starting to ""live under a rock"".

# The Excitement of Certain Times

When we both manage to get out of being homebodies, that's also a great time.

I don't know about you, but I love getting dressed to the 20s (the 9s is too little). Perfect outfit. Perfect perfume. Even the choice of lotion is well decided. Then... We pull up to a great reservation... Somewhere simple.

God, do I hate those super expensive places that serve you three shreds of food and you're left wanting.

Let's go get tacos then roll up to a private lounge where you need a reservation a month out just to have a few drinks and little bites. Then we step out and walk down the street along the way stopping at an antique book store before noticing there's an ice cream shop next door.

Now, I love smoking cigars (not every day obviously), so you push me along to our reservation at the cigar lounge. We pull up, hugs and kisses as per Hispanic protocol to our friends who are staff. We take our seats, order our drinks, listen to the live music, and you can watch me light my cigar with patience which shows why you love me. Maybe you'll be the type of partner that joins me in smoking a cigar (if you're not that's OK).

We have to be constantly remembering to take pictures and selfies otherwise there's never a darn record that we went out or did anything. Always more preoccupied with the vibes and capturing the landscapes that ourselves.

The conversation is always great between us as we laugh and chat, even texting the things we can't say aloud as we plan the end of the evening.

# The ""Me to You""

Who am I as a partner? Let's go bullet mode...

* You get woken up to gentle kisses and ""Your (INSERT MORNING DRINK HERE) is ready, honey. Do you want your eggs scrambled or fried? Oh, I also got fresh Cuban bread.""
* I walk over with a glass of water and a fistful of meds the moment I see you start to go under the weather or you mention a coworker/friend/family member is getting sick
* I come home with pastries/treats if I happen to be driving by one of your favorite spots
* I write you little notes to keep in your bags, desks, and other such places
* I never leave without knowing the next time I will see you
* I happily help with technology-related issues
* AND SO MUCH MORE!!!

# Who am I?

Here's the pertinent details about me...

* Located in Miami, FL but travel often for work across the southeast US and occassionally outside the southeast for conferences, trainings, and otherwise
* 5'7"" (170 cm), 165 lb (75 kg), average build
* Black short hair with equally black and short facial hair (moustache and ""beard"")
* Deep brown eyes framed with glasses
* Sleep schedule is roughly 10 PM - 7 AM, on weekends more like 11 PM - 8 AM (or 9 AM)
* Work as an electrical engineer in a fully remote position
* Main hobbies are gaming, reading/writing, cooking, photography, cigars, coffee, mixology, and now perfumes/perfumery
* Secondary hobbies include gardening, painting, interior design, and martial arts (judo, kendo, and iaido)
* Type one diabetic (T1D) since I was 4 years old, so I am insulin dependent and use an insulin pump and continous glucose monitor (CGM)
* I have a Samsung (Android)... Why is this important? You'd be surprised how it goes with the **Blue Bubble Gang**
* I am mainly a PC and PS5 gamer these days, BUT I do own an Xbox Series X and Nintendo Switch. I have also successfully acquired a wonderful OLED Steamdeck I have been adoring for work and personal travel
* Some of the games I play (or have played) include: World of Warcraft (Retail & Classic), Diablo / Path of Exile, Halo (2, 3, and some Reach), Oldschool Runescape, Skyrim, and so forth
* My Steam library includes 975 games and counting at this time
* I own an Oculus Rift 2 for VR and I play PC VR games as well through Virtual Desktop
* I also enjoy board games and TTRPGs (I haven't done DnD 5e in FOREVER but am SO down to do it again)
* I am a Disney Annual Pass (AP) holder and Vacation Club (DVC) owner at the Riviera Resort (which means Skyliner access to Epcot's France and English pavilions and Hollywood Studios with ease)

# Important Details (PLEASE READ)

My main key point is that I don't care WHO you are or WHAT you look like or WHAT you're into so long as you see yourself fitting into this picture I have painted.

Every detail I wrote is important to me. There is nothing there that I can really compromise on without compromising myself and what makes my life happy to live and future worth working toward.

However, let's be clear about some of the following...

**Big details...**

* I am open to online/long-distance so long as we are BOTH putting in the work it takes
* I am only interested in cis(female) or transmale partners since I would like to start a biological family at some point
* I am NOT interested in potential partners that already have children, though potential exception may be made for those parents with children 13 years-old or older AND still healthy enough to have more children
* I am only interested in those in the United States at this point (this is due to international travel being more difficult due to my job)
* If you are NOT in the United States and STILL wish to try at this, please know that YOU will have to try to visit me instead of the other way around until I figure out the logistics of visiting your country with my job

**More about you...**

* You have a job
* You take care of yourself (e.g. if you have a medical condition you are actively treating it, you attend therapy if applicable, etc.)
* Co-habitation, long-term commitment, and having kids does NOT scare you and is a decided fact for you (not saying right off the bat but once the years pass and we reach each step), if you are unsure about any of those then maybe this isn't for you (and that's OK)

# Misc. Personal Facts (in more detail)

**Medical History**

I am formally diagnosed with...

* *Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) (26 years)* \- This is the insulin-dependent brand of diabetes which I treat through insulin-pump therapy on a closed-loop system using a continous glucose monitor (CGM)
* *ADHD (probably lifelong)* \- This I found out earlier this year after having to fight for an adult diagnosis. I have garden variety ""inattentive"" ADHD and I medicate it sometimes when I am going through very stressful, high octane periods using a non-stimulant (so no Addy)
* *Rosacea* \- A lovely auto-immune-based skin condition that causes redness at the cheeks and is treated using some creams
* *Hashimoto's* \- A thyroid condition which typically causes lower-than-normal thyroid hormone production and is ultimately treated using hormone supplementation. I am not yet at that point since my thyroid is still functioning normally. This is also auto-immune in nature.

**Sleep Tendencies**

I typically sleep from 10-11 PM to around 7-8 AM on the delightful ""right"" side of the bed (meaning the right from the foot of the bed, left side if you're laying in it). I am a side sleeper who has a whole position which involves a few extra pillows for my arms to be comfy. Soft, cooling sheets and blankets are a NECESSARY part of my sleep along with a ceiling fan on full blast and the temperature at 68 degrees F or lower (20 degrees C). I will lovingly cuddle you for a bit then we both eff off to either side of the bed and we sweetly touch our butts together or we cross ankles. Random cuddles will occur at checkpoints through the night as my T1D wakes me up for the mandatory ""am I dying"" checks.

If I wake up first, don't be surprised if I leave the bed to go get my day started. I will happily return to cuddle you awake at your self-designated wake up time (or when you come looking for me hugging a pillow and whining). Fair game!

**Meals and Food**

I do not like most sea food (though I do love conch fritters, fried shrimp, swordfish, mahi mahi, and a few other odd items). No, I will not share a sea food boil with you. Yes, I will pay for it, get it for you, and deliver it safely into your hands with a loving kiss. Yes, you can keep it all to yourself.

I eat a very light breakfast every morning with my mandatory Cuban *cafe con leche* because otherwise I will start softly cursing in Spanish as I brood around. A have a light to medium lunch between 11 AM and 1 PM, then I have an early dinner around 6 to 7 PM (to avoid blood sugar spikes in the night).

I also have mandatory coffee breaks mid morning around 9:30 AM to 10 AM and around 3 to 4 PM. Yes, I will also make you a beautiful pour over with fresh ground, locally sourced coffee. Yes, I love you too.

**Hygiene**

Daily showers for me are important, once to twice a day depending on level of activity. This includes a ceramide-based face wash along with some skin-care (yes, I do skin care and yes we can do it together; face masks!).

I have very sensitive skin so I do not shave, trimming is the best I can do. Even if I could, the moustache and short facial hair stays otherwise I look like I'm 15. Baby face will be stupidly beneficial in my 40s.

Electric toothbrushes, water picks, and standard string floss are goated. Just saying.

Perfume. Ah, perfume. Did you know that *I own over 100 perfumes* ranging from Eau de Toilettes to beautiful Extraits and Parfums? Yes, I also buy some Bath & Body Works stuff. Yes, we can go together. Also yes, I will go to Sephora with you and you can shop for make up while I sniff smelly water in the perfume section.

**Love Languages**

My main trio is:

1. Quality Time (this includes parallel play)
2. Acts of Service
3. Physical Touch and/or Words of Affirmation (it kinda flips around the two depending on distance and how busy we are)

I am a little weird about:

* Receiving gifts - I have a 6 figure job and can afford to gift myself what I want so when people who work really hard give me gifts, I feel really bad they spent their money on me like that. You *can* buy me cafecitos and cortaditos. Those are cheap and make me very happy. :3

I enjoy mystery, sci-fi or historical fiction! Looking to connect with kind goal oriented and thoughtful people.

I need to make my coffee quickly, 5 minutes max, with absolutely no grounds in my mug. I'm not too concerned about taste as I use plenty of creamer and sugar. With a Keurig, I make 16oz of coffee so how do I do that with a pour over? How much grounds would I use with how many ounces of water? Do I actually need to wet the paper filter first? Would a stainless steel filter work as well?

  
What will be the best brand/model for me to get? I'm more concerned about ease of use and length of time it would take to make coffee than quality. There are so many options out there and other posts are not helping me decide as I feel other people care about the taste of their coffee where I don't.

I (28F) cut off two friends this week, and I’m honestly just done with people.

For context, I’m high-functioning autistic. People forget this constantly. I’m not great at reading social cues. I can’t always go outside — it stresses me out, I get overstimulated, and it can take days to recover after socializing. Especially when there’s any kind of “abusive language.” I can’t handle confrontation, even perceived confrontation. I shut down.

I struggle with being there for people emotionally, but I do my damn best. I wish people would actually see that. I listen to people’s problems. I “borrow” people money (never ask for it back). I help whenever I have the means. But I guess people don’t view that as caring — and it’s rarely reciprocated.

I also struggle with working for people, so I’m on disability and I do some “spicy content” on the side.

Anyway, I had this friend (37F). Her and I got along great. Our birthdays were close, and right before that I started noticing some patterns:

* She’d call and immediately start complaining about her life.
* She’d go off about her son (17) — who is honestly a nightmare. He yells, calls her names, stomps around, makes guests uncomfortable, demands his child tax money, complains about his 7-year-old non-verbal autistic sister calling him “stupid.”
* She’d complain about her mom never helping with babysitting, doctors, anything — but still berating her for asking.
* She’d ask me for coffee or smoke money — always small stuff — and I’d help if I could.
* She’d hang up on me randomly, usually because I couldn’t come over or give her money.

Over time, I realized she never asked how *I* was doing. Anytime I shared something, she’d immediately redirect back to herself. I let it slide because I knew she was going through a lot — kids, bipolar disorder, constant stress. But I can’t always be there.

When my birthday came, I didn’t tell her my plans. I knew she’d get mad if I didn’t spend it with her. I went to a concert with another friend and had an amazing time — which is rare for me because I usually put my loved ones first.

She got mad afterward because I didn’t spend my birthday at her house with her kids. And her gift… like, I know “it’s the thought that counts,” but shampoo and conditioner? From my supposed best friend?

Then her birthday came. I did EVERYTHING: got her a nice gift, bought wine (her favorite), brought a big Chinese dinner for all of us including her kids. Spent the whole evening with her. We had a good night even though the babysitter bailed.

A few weeks later she started accusing me of not caring about her. Something happened with her son (really bad), and she wanted me around. I wasn’t on my phone for three days because I was working on a novelty painting for *her*. When I finally checked my phone, I saw messages like:  
“Wow, you can’t ever leave your house?”  
“Do you ever do anything besides be at home?”  
“Nobody cares about me.”

Again, I let it go.

Then her son did something awful, and she *really* needed me — and I didn’t show up. And yes, I know that part is on me. But here’s why:

At the same time, my roommate (37M), who had lived with me rent-free for four months, came into money. He refused to give me any of it ($2,500). He ate 30 pizza pops in 4 days, plus all my peanut butter, Nutella — literally everything small. He drank all my coffee, complained it wasn’t strong enough, complained about my cats, slept for days, woke up in the worst moods, and tried to cause problems with my boyfriend.

This money situation was the last straw. After caring for a man-child for months, he said he didn’t care about everything I’d done for him. So I told him I didn’t care either and kicked him out. Then I found his drugs. Of course.

And ON TOP of all that… my godfather died. I was planning a funeral.

And you know what my “best friend” said to me?  
That I’m LAZY, and I need to get a job, because all I care about is money.

What the actual f\*\*\*.

She didn’t ask about my godfather. She didn’t ask about my roommate. She didn’t ask about anything happening in my life. She didn’t give a shit. But she demanded I drop everything and care about her. No compassion. No grace. Just berating me. And when I finally stood up for myself… she blocked me.

I’m done helping people. I don’t care if I have no friends and it’s just my BF and my cats. At least my BF actually cares about me.",1,1765205959.0,u_Randomredditgirl4321,0,1.0,False
1phei7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1phei7j/day_9_today_what_a_week_some_positives_and/,Day 9 Today - What a Week! Some Positives and Negatives,"Tl:dr:

\- Lower Anxiety and Back Pain

\- Better sleep

\- Bad Brain Fog





10 days ago a small cup of coffee gave me a panic attack in the middle of town and I decided it wasn't worth it. 

**Positives:**

\- Sleep is better, specifically the very first moments after opening my eyes. It now feels like I have ""woken up"" rather than just briefly regaining a slither of consciousness. Mid morning still feels a bit slow but I also might be hungover.

\- Anxiety, gone. Completely gone. That left on the second day. I am not an anxious person, but over the last year I have been getting (quite brutal) random attacks of anxiety where I desperately have to leave the place I am in. Taking trains was a nightmare as soon as the door closed. That has not happened even one tiny time this entire week. It feels like a miracle actually. 

\- Reduced back pain. This one is super weird, unexpected and I think connected to the anxiety. A year ago roughly I herniated a disk in my back. For the last 6 months, when I would smoke weed, my spine would start to feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable, as if the individual discs were not happy touching each other. This would cause me to have to lay down on the flat ground, no matter where I was (in public as well, freak) so that I could stretch it out and take the pressure off for 30 mins. I have been high this week at some points and NO BACK PAIN AT ALL - NONE.

\- Morning Stomach Pain from coffee on an empty stomach, GONE.

**Negatives:**

\- Thick Brain Fog. I had some days this week where I did not do one single task for longer than 2 minutes without switching to something unrelated-but-suddenly-important only to then stop doing that 2 minutes later... That has died off somewhat now (I would not have written more than two lines this time last week)

\- Sadness when thinking about coffee. Only once yesterday have I had an actual 'craving' which I think is because compared to the hatred towards anxiety, my love for coffee is nothing. But when I think about coffee I do feel like a piece has been lost in my day... I still am going to cafes but I have been drinking a juice instead.",4,1765205950.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

This friend “Lauren” and I have been friends since we were 9. She was also good friends with my sister and our moms were friends. We’ve kind of bounced back and forth from being very close to drifting apart. We were close when we were little, didn’t talk for a while, were incredibly close again in high school (when we attended the same school again) and the beginning of college, drifted apart again for a few years, got close again in grad school and lived together for a year, before drifting apart for a while again after I moved out for a job in another town. 

None of the times we drifted apart were for any bad reasons or anything like that. They were just the kind of normal life stuff that happens when you’re younger, experiencing tons of life changes and moving around a lot. Frankly, it was also due to some bad mental health on both of our ends as well. We haven’t been close for five years or so but have kept in touch and increased our contact again within the past year. We hung out for the first time in a while a few months ago. 

“Lauren” lives a couple of hours away but is obviously back in our hometown due to her dad’s passing. I know I’m not her closest friend anymore, but I also know I’m probably the closest friend she has within our hometown by a couple of hours. I also know her though, and know she likes to be by herself and has a tendency to isolate herself. Her dads funeral isn’t until Saturday, so she’ll be here for a while. 

I sent a message offering condolences and saying I’m here for her upon hearing of her dad’s passing and Lauren liked it a day after his passing. I have gotten a bag together of some items for her including a stuffed animal of her favorite animal, some coloring books and a ton of markers (she loves these), a DoorDash giftcard, some face masks, makeup wipes/body wipes, a few snacks, and a card with a note and made her favorite bread. My original plan has been to drive it to her parent’s house where she is staying and leave it on the doorstep. 

This just feels really impersonal. I would like to send her a text saying I have something for her and just offering to see her if she would like to. I worry about putting that decision on her though. I’m not sure if that’s the right move or the best way to word the message that puts the least amount of “pressure” on her? I’d also like to offer to bring them some coffee or food from a restaurant since they live a good 25 minutes outside of our small city. 

Is there a good way to word this? Should I just leave the gift at her door? Should I wait a few days? For those of you who have lost a parent, how would you have wanted to be supported?

This just feels really impersonal. I would like to send her a text saying I have something for her and just offering to see her if she would like to. I worry about putting that decision on her though. I’m not sure the best way to word the message that puts the least amount of “pressure” on her? I’d also like to offer to bring them some coffee or food from a restaurant since they live a good 25 minutes outside of our small city. 

I'm not sure if I should just leave it at her door without the message, send a message, or wait a few days. For those of you who have lost a parent, how would you have wanted to be supported?

My uncle showed me (what I now consider) the best way to have coffee - via moka pot. He brewed me a few cups and I raved about it. Showed me how to do it on his home setup when I visited him, I'll list below: 

* fill chamber to valve with room temp filtered water
* he likes to use dark Vermont coffee beans that he grinds pretty fine
* put on gas burner outside on his grill
* turn off when it starts flowing (though I had no different results in mistiming it and coming out well after)
* coffee comes out great (I like it w/ a little half and half and sugar). Best cup ever.

So he sends me home with one of his 3 Geesta glass top pots. I tried various beans, grinding more, grinding less, right out of the bag (ground), and I can not stop getting a bitter cup, no matter what I do. Here's some of the things I've done:

* filtered tapwater
* hot tapwater (about 120°F)
* filtered tapwater that I then heat to 185°F in the microwave (I don't have a kettle)

As for heating on the stove, I've tried:

* high pre-heat, then turning it off as soon as it flows
* hot tap water, high pre-heat, then moving it to a low (3-4, mine goes from 0-10) separate burner as soon as it flows, then move to a cool towel once it seems to change color/sputter
* hot microwaved water, medium (5) pre-heat, then moving to low (3) when it starts flowing, moving to towel when it sputters

I'm now using Lavazza Italian dark roast, thinking the Folgers and the Black Rifle coffees I was using for testing were too thin and didn't have enough flavor to extract, but 2 times today, the Lavazza has produced bitter coffee, no matter what heating cycle I use. 

This is especially frustrating because I didn't have to babysit it when I was using his gas grill, and I even came out a few times and the safety valve was letting off some steam, and it still tasted fine. Everything I'm doing now doesn't seem to work, and I don't know what it is, other than the heating cycle. I don't know if it's heating too quickly or what the right answer is, and he doesn't have an electric stove to offer advice. ",2,1765205513.0,mokapot,4,1.0,False

1pheaox,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pheaox/the_hosts_of_creepcast_are_no_longer_human/,The Hosts of CreepCast are No Longer Human.,"The warehouse always smelled faintly of metal and coffee. It wasn’t a bad smell, just wrong for morning. The air in the studio was cool enough that Isaiah could see his breath when he first unlocked the door. A thin trail of vapor, gone almost as soon as it appeared.

He flicked on the lights. The room answered with a harsh buzz. The LED strips glowed a little too white, washing the color from his skin. He rubbed at his neck. The flesh there felt cold and papery, though he didn’t think much of it.

The neon sign on the back wall sputtered to life.

CREEPCAST.

The orange light wavered before settling, casting a dull reflection across the table. The foam panels around the room swallowed sound. The silence that followed was thick enough to make him aware of every motion — the click of the laptop booting, the whisper of cables sliding against the desk, the static flutter as he switched the soundboard on.

He cracked open an energy drink and took a long swallow. The liquid tasted metallic, sharper than usual like he was drinking penny water. When he set the can down, he caught his reflection in the dark monitor across from him. The eyes staring back looked bloodshot. He blinked and the red vanished.

Routine steadied him.

Project file open. Gain levels checked. Mic one, mic two, ring lights. He hummed to test the reverb in the space and watched the audio bars bounce green. The hum sounded lower than it should have, as if his throat had sunk deeper.

He went to the glass door and peered into the gray parking lot. Empty.

10:42 a.m. 8 years into the podcast, and Hunter still couldn’t show up on time. 

Isaiah stood there longer than he meant to, staring at the asphalt through the haze of morning light. The air outside rippled faintly, as if heat were rising from it, though the temperature was cold. He realized he was pressing his fingertips against the glass too hard — when he pulled them back, faint smudges were left behind, almost greasy.

The door creaked open behind him.

Hunter stepped in, hoodie half-zipped, the faint smell of fast food trailing with him. “Morning, Dr. Audiofile,” he said, voice bright as ever. But his skin looked pale, almost gray under the lights. The veins in his neck were faintly visible, a map of bluish lines. 

Isaiah forced a laugh. “You’re late.”

“You’re paranoid,” Hunter said, kicking the door shut. “Traffic. And maybe I stopped for food.”

“You always stop for food.”

“Starving artists gotta eat.” He grinned, teeth faintly discolored from coffee. Maybe it was the light in the room but his gums looked grey. 

They moved through setup together. Isaiah adjusted the ring light; Hunter aligned the mics. The familiar motions steadied them both. Still, there was a faint smell — not quite rot, not quite iron. Like the residue of something burned.

Hunter rubbed his forearm absentmindedly, skin flakes dusting the table. “Cold in here today.”

Isaiah nodded. “Feels weird, right? Like the air’s too dry.”

They laughed it off.

When everything was ready, Isaiah hit record.

The red light blinked on. Cameras, mics, mixer — all alive.

“Welcome back to CreepCast,” Isaiah said, his voice warm and smooth. “The only show where the mayonnaise is, and I quote, the sauce of the aristocrat.”

Hunter groaned. “We are not bringing that back.”

“It’s tradition.”

“It’s trauma.”

Their laughter bounced clean through the room. The sound was perfect — crisp, intimate. They could almost forget the chill.

They flowed from story to story. Haunted truck stops. Cursed phones. Listener submissions about ghosts in drainpipes. Their rhythm was easy. Each time Hunter leaned forward, the ring light caught in his eyes, and for an instant the whites looked dull, almost clouded. Isaiah noticed but said nothing.

At the forty-minute mark, Isaiah leaned closer to the mic. His throat ached faintly. He heard a whispering hiss underneath his own words. It wasn’t feedback. It had a shape to it, like someone imitating him a breath too late.

He froze.

Hunter kept talking. “You good?”

Isaiah forced a grin. “Yeah. Just checking the levels.”

He turned a knob and the hiss vanished, or seemed to. The air was still cold, though. The LED light flickered once, and in that brief dimness, Hunter’s skin looked wrong — stretched too tight, as if thinned by light itself.

The red recording light blinked off.

“That’s a wrap,” Isaiah said.

Hunter leaned back, cracking his neck. “That one felt solid.”

“Yeah.” Isaiah rubbed his throat again. His fingers came away with a faint trace of red, like rust powder. He wiped it on his jeans before Hunter could see.

The silence afterward was heavy. Somewhere in the speakers, the faintest hum continued — a note that hadn’t existed before.

“Do you hear that?” Isaiah asked.

Hunter listened. “Just the building settling.”

Isaiah nodded, but he knew it wasn’t the building. It was lower, rhythmic, like breath passing through a mouth that wasn’t quite human.

Isaiah stayed behind to handle the edit. Hunter never liked post-production, claiming his creative genius ended when the mics went off.

The quiet that followed a recording always had its own gravity. The hum of the equipment, the faint aftertaste of energy drinks, the ghost of conversation still clinging to the air. Isaiah liked it that way — the world reduced to sliders and sound waves.

He slipped on his headphones and opened the raw session file.

For the first half-hour everything sounded clean. Their usual rhythm, the joking interruptions, the way Hunter’s laughter cracked halfway through a story. The comfort of predictability.

Then, at thirty-four minutes, a noise caught his ear.

He paused the track and rolled it back.

At first, it was nothing more than static — a shallow, shifting hiss. But as he amplified it, the noise bent itself into a rhythm. Almost a breath. Almost a voice.

He leaned closer to the monitor.

The whisper was faint but deliberate, the syllables stretching like air pulled through wet cloth.

“Isaiah.”

His own name.

He froze, replayed it again, slower this time. The whisper repeated. Soft. Intimate.

His pulse ticked faster.

He soloed Hunter’s mic to see if it had come from there. The channel was clean. The voice was isolated to his own feed, whispering directly under his laughter.

He frowned, rubbed his face. “No way.”

He scrolled back and forth on the timeline, but the cursor started to lag, moving even when he lifted his hand from the mouse. The project kept playing on its own for half a second before stopping.

Isaiah stared at the screen. Then he saved and closed it.

The room had grown darker without him noticing. The LEDs still glowed white, but everything beneath them looked drained — gray tables, gray floor, the faint reflection of his own face caught between screens.

He stood, stretched, and felt a sharp ache in his knuckles. When he flexed his hands, the skin made a soft cracking sound. He turned them over and saw that the color had gone pale, almost blue.

He rubbed his fingers together. They felt dry, the skin rough like sandpaper.

He blamed it on the air. On the long hours.

He packed his bag and stepped toward the exit.

The neon sign at the back of the room still burned orange. He could have sworn he had turned it off. The glow crawled over the metal panels, dimming and brightening in uneven waves.

Isaiah unplugged it, waited, and watched the light fade. The sign’s outline stayed visible for a few seconds longer than it should have — an afterimage that seemed carved into his vision.

Outside, the sky had gone gray. The parking lot stretched empty in all directions, but something about it felt distorted, as if the depth had flattened.

When he got to his car, he looked down at his palms again. The veins looked darker now, almost black beneath the skin.

He tried not to think about it.

His phone buzzed just as he started the engine. A message from Hunter.

“Yo, are you editing that weird whisper yet?”

He frowned, thumbed back:

“What whisper?”

“The one under my track. Sounds like me laughing when I’m not talking.”

He stared at the message for a long time.

“Probably bleed,” he typed.

“Sure,” Hunter replied. “But it laughed after I did.”

No more messages came.

When Isaiah got home, the static hum of his refrigerator sounded almost like the room’s hiss from earlier — low, steady, alive.

He lay in bed, staring at the dark ceiling, and caught himself breathing in sync with the noise.

When he finally fell asleep, he dreamt of microphones. Their black mouths opening wider, cords twisting across the floor like veins.

By dusk, Hunter was already back at the studio. He claimed he had forgotten his water bottle, but the truth was simpler: he didn’t like being alone in his apartment after hearing that whisper in his audio.

The warehouse looked different at night. The orange tint of the city light pressed through the frosted windows, turning the dust into floating amber grains. The studio’s walls seemed closer, like the panels had crept inward.

The air carried a faint odor — iron, ozone, and something older.

When Isaiah arrived, the first thing he noticed was the smell.

“Man, you leave food in here?”

Hunter looked up from the console. His face was pale beneath the ring light, his eyes sunken in more than usual, skin slightly glossy as though damp. “No,” he said. “I came back to check something. Thought maybe we left the mics on.”

“You hear the whisper too?”

Hunter nodded slowly. His voice sounded rougher, deeper. “It said my name. Then yours. I tried to delete the track but it wouldn’t.”

Isaiah moved closer. On the monitor, a new project window was open. The cursor crawled across the screen on its own, tracing empty waveform space.

“Hardware bug,” Isaiah muttered, leaning in. But the closer he looked, the clearer the static sounded. The same slow breath, soft and wet.

The studio lights flickered.

Hunter lifted his hand to his face. “Do I look weird to you?”

Isaiah hesitated.

The skin around Hunter’s eyes had taken a dull yellow tint, veins branching outward like roots. His lips looked dry, cracked at the corners with fresh blood threatening to peak out. 

“Yeah,” Isaiah said finally. “You’re pale.”

“You too,” Hunter replied quietly. “Like the blood’s gone out of you.”

They stared at each other in the reflection of the monitor, both faces ghostly in the glow. The colors looked wrong — too muted, too even.

Isaiah reached out and touched the edge of the desk. The metal felt sticky. When he lifted his hand, faint residue clung to his fingertips.

“What is this?”

Hunter didn’t answer. He was watching the waveform move. A faint green pulse, perfectly timed with their breathing.

“Is it recording?” Isaiah asked.

“I didn’t hit record,” Hunter said.

Their microphones began to hum.

Both of them froze.

The sound was subtle at first — a low drone rising and falling like a tide. The red recording light blinked even though the interface was closed.

“Hunter,” Isaiah whispered. “Unplug it.”

Hunter reached for the cable, hesitated. “What if—”

The speakers crackled, cutting him off. Their laughter from that morning spilled into the room, warped and slowed.

“Welcome back to CreepCast…”

The words stretched and twisted until they became nothing but breath and vowels.

Isaiah yanked the power strip. The lights died, plunging them into darkness.

For a moment, there was nothing — only the faint breathing of the equipment.

Then a sound came from the far corner of the room. A scrape, like nails dragging across the floor.

Hunter turned on his phone flashlight.

The beam caught the edge of the soundboard. The cables were shifting, inching across the concrete, coiling together like snakes.

Isaiah grabbed his bag. “We’re done for tonight. Let’s go.”

They backed toward the door. As they passed the glass window, both caught their reflections.

The shapes staring back weren’t quite right. The faces were theirs, but the mouths hung slightly open, teeth too long, the eyes shining faintly like wet coins. Hair so thin it looked as though it belonged to a newborn. 

Isaiah turned away first. “It’s the lighting.”

“Yeah,” Hunter said, though his voice trembled. “Lighting.”

They stepped out into the cold night. Neither looked back.

But as they walked to their cars, the orange glow from the warehouse followed them — reflected in the windows, pulsing slow as a heartbeat.

The next night, the city was wrapped in mist. The industrial district looked drowned in it, every light a blurred halo. Isaiah’s car headlights barely pierced the fog as he pulled into the lot.

He told himself he was only returning to grab the hard drive, maybe to make sure everything had actually shut off. But guilt was a quiet pressure behind his ribs. He hadn’t been able to stop thinking about the way Hunter’s skin looked, about the sound that had followed them out the door.

The warehouse was dark except for the faint orange glow seeping through the frosted windows. The CREEPCAST sign was still on, pulsing unevenly.

Inside, the air was colder than the night outside. The hum of the soundboard was gone, replaced by a slower, deeper vibration, like breath trapped in metal.

He closed the door behind him. “Hunter?”

His voice echoed thinly across the room.

No response.

The main monitor glowed across the table, its light spilling over empty chairs and cables. The session project was open again. The cursor was moving by itself, tracing across the waveform. The bars pulsed in perfect time with the faint vibration in the air.

Isaiah’s skin prickled. He stepped closer.

On the track names he saw the file titles had changed:

	•	22\_11\_HUNTER.wav

	•	22\_12\_ISAIAH.wav

	•	22\_13\_HUNTERISAIAH.wav

He reached for the keyboard to stop it, but the playhead kept sliding forward.

“Hunter?” he called again, quieter this time.

A sound came from the booth — a low scrape of a chair.

He turned.

Hunter sat at the far end of the table, headphones still on, his head tilted down.

“Jesus, you scared me,” Isaiah said. “What are you doing here? I thought you left.”

No answer.

Isaiah took a step forward. The light from the monitor found Hunter’s face.

He stopped breathing.

Hunter’s skin had grayed almost completely it was nearly translucent, veins standing dark against the surface. His lips had thinned, cracked wide at the corners. His eyes looked glassy, the pupils shrunken to tiny pinpoints. Beneath the skin at his neck, the faint movement of something pulsing could be seen — veins or cords twitching with a rhythm that wasn’t human.

“Hunter?”

The word came out like a whisper.

Hunter lifted his head slowly. The skin under his eyes stretched tight as he moved, almost tearing. “It’s still recording,” he said. His voice was low and hollow, like it had to crawl up his throat. “I tried to stop it.”

Isaiah stared. “Man, you need to go to a hospital.”

Hunter’s eyes flicked to the screen. “It doesn’t want me to.”

The monitor’s glow flickered, washing the room in alternating pale and orange light. Each flicker showed Hunter’s face slightly differently — sometimes too long, sometimes the skin drawn back a little farther, the mouth opening just enough to glimpse blackened gums.

Isaiah forced himself to move. He stepped around the table to the console. “I’m shutting it off.”

Before he could touch the keyboard, the speakers hissed. The hum grew louder, layered with faint laughter. Their own laughter, played back slower and slower until it dissolved into a gurgling tone.

Then the voices began to blend.

“Welcome back,” the speakers said. Both of their voices, together, distorted and thick.

Isaiah jerked back. “That’s us.”

Hunter nodded weakly. “It learned how to talk.”

The microphones swiveled on their stands with a mechanical creak, facing them. The cables along the floor twitched as though pulled by breath.

Hunter whispered, “It wants us to keep recording.”

Isaiah shook his head. “No. We’re leaving.” He turned toward the door.

The knob didn’t move.

He hit it harder, but it only rattled in place. “It’s locked.”

“Did you lock it?”

“It locks from the outside,” Isaiah said.

Behind them, the neon sign flared, bathing the room in a deep orange light. The air rippled. The speakers released a sound like inhalation.

Hunter stood slowly. His movements were jerky now, like a marionette learning balance. The smell that followed him was sickly-sweet, rot mixed with electricity.

He touched the edge of the table, and where his fingers pressed, the laminate darkened with oily residue.

“Isaiah,” he said, his tone uneven, “don’t fight it. It’s almost done.”

His teeth glinted — longer now, crooked, a shade of gray that caught the light wrong.

Isaiah backed toward the door. “What did you do?”

“It’s not me.” Hunter’s neck jerked as if a spasm ran through it. “It’s us.”

The computer’s display began to distort, image bending like melted glass. The waveform split into two moving tracks labeled HOST 1 and HOST 2. Both pulsed in time with their breathing.

The hum turned into words again, layered, closer:

“Do not stop.”

Hunter’s chest hitched. A long breath shuddered out of him, whistling through his teeth. His fingers flexed, nails blackening at the edges.

Isaiah lunged forward, grabbed the power cord, and yanked.

The room exploded in static.

The noise was unbearable — shrieking, grinding, wet. It pressed through the air like heat. Isaiah fell back, clutching his ears.

Then it ended.

The lights flickered once.

The neon sign went dark.

The speakers whispered, barely audible:

“Keep recording.”

Isaiah opened his eyes.

Hunter was still standing, frozen in place, mouth open, chest barely moving. The whites of his eyes had turned gray, the pupils swallowed by shadow.

For the first time, Isaiah noticed that his own hands were trembling, veins black and raised. Beneath his nails, the skin had started to crack. He rubbed at it frantically, flakes of skin coming off like dry seaweed.

The air stank of metal and old blood.

He looked at Hunter, who was staring back now — a faint smile creeping across his torn lips.

“We’re still live,” Hunter said, voice warbling.

The microphones leaned closer.

The red light blinked on.

The hum thickened until it was nearly tangible, vibrating through every panel of the studio. The air shimmered with heat and static, the faint orange light from the neon sign pulsing like a dying heartbeat.

Isaiah crouched by the wall, hands over his ears. The soundboard lights flashed erratically, throwing color across his face — green, gold, red — until everything merged into the color of blood.

Across the table, Hunter stood motionless, head tilted toward the ceiling as though listening to something above them. The skin of his neck had stretched thin; dark veins climbed up toward his jaw. His mouth twitched open and closed like he was mouthing silent words.

The microphones hissed again, their stands creaking. They leaned toward him, close enough that the edges of the foam brushed his lips.

The sound that came out wasn’t human. A slow, rasping syllable that broke apart before becoming a word. The speakers echoed it immediately, layering it into something deeper.

Then both channels began recording again. The screen glowed with new files forming:

HUNTER.wav

ISAIAH.wav

HOST\_1.wav

HOST\_2.wav

Isaiah forced himself to stand. His knees cracked. The smell of rot clung to him — his own body breaking down. The veins in his arms had turned black, the flesh around his knuckles splitting like dried fruit.

“Hunter,” he said, voice hoarse. “We have to stop this.”

Hunter turned toward him slowly. His eyes had clouded completely, the pupils gone. When he smiled, his teeth looked cracked and gray, the edges sharp like stone.

“It’s still going,” he said. “It needs us.”

The studio’s lights flickered again, faster now. The room seemed to breathe — walls expanding and contracting, the air shifting in waves. Each breath carried the smell of rust and old meat.

Isaiah stumbled back against the wall. His reflection glimmered faintly in the glass of the control booth. He almost didn’t recognize himself. The skin of his face had lost its tone, lips darkened, eyes sinking into shadow. The sound that came from his throat was wet and low.

He wiped at his mouth. His fingertips came away with a thin smear of black.

The speakers erupted with laughter — their laughter — looped and distorted.

“Welcome back to CreepCast…”

“…where the mayonnaise is…”

“…the sauce of the aristocrat.”

The voices overlapped until they became a single, toneless murmur.

Hunter stumbled forward, one hand clutching the edge of the desk. “It’s finishing the episode,” he said.

The microphones swung toward them. The red recording light turned steady. The waveform on the monitor began to pulse, keeping time with their movements.

The speakers whispered, “We are the hosts.”

Isaiah’s stomach twisted. He felt something crawling beneath his skin, threading along his ribs and into his neck — cords tightening, pulling him upright. His breath came out in shudders. His voice cracked open on instinct.

“Stop,” he whispered. But even his whisper echoed through the speakers, deeper than it should have been.

The echo answered: “Keep going.”

His knees buckled. The cables on the floor had begun to shift again, inching toward his feet, wrapping lightly around his ankles. The rubber was slick, warm to the touch.

Across from him, Hunter had fallen to his knees, breathing in short bursts. Every exhale came out as a wheeze. His skin had gone gray and sunken; his fingers ended in dark nails that clicked against the floor.

Isaiah watched in horror as Hunter’s jaw spasmed open. The flesh around his mouth split slightly at the corners, black liquid beading along the cracks. Isaiah watched as Hunter vomited his innards onto the floor into a mess of melted intestines and softened teeth. Resembling that of tapioca pudding. 

Through the pain, Hunter managed to laugh — a wet, thick sound. “It’s… us.”

The laughter continued through the speakers, looping in perfect sync.

“We are the hosts.”

“We are the cast.”

“We are still recording.”

Isaiah felt his spine stiffen as if cords had been threaded through it. His skin burned. His teeth ached against his gums. The pressure in his head rose until he could hear nothing but the vibration of the neon light.

Then his vision doubled.

He saw Hunter across from him — but also saw himself from Hunter’s perspective, as if their eyes had merged. The screens flickered between them, each reflection slightly out of time.

They moved together without meaning to. Both leaned toward their microphones, skin tearing faintly at the necks, breath rattling in their throats. The smell of decay thickened until the air itself tasted metallic.

Hunter’s voice came out first — a distorted blend of whisper and growl. “Tonight’s episode…”

Isaiah’s mouth opened against his will. “…is about voices that never stop.”

The lights flared once more, searing white.

The microphones began to hum in harmony, the cables tightening around their bodies, binding them to the table.

They kept speaking — slow, uneven, almost ritualistic — as their faces caved inward and the flesh along their arms darkened like charred paper.

“…haunted gas stations…”

“…mirrors that talk back…”

“…voices that don’t die…”

Each phrase dissolved into static.

Their eyes turned white. Their skin dried into ash-gray texture, lips receding to reveal cracked teeth. The glow of the monitor painted their faces in the same dead light as the waveform’s pulse.

Still, they smiled.

When the sound finally dropped to silence, both stood completely still. The wave on the screen flattened into a line. The file saved itself automatically:

The Hosts That Creep Their Casts.wav

Two hours long. Perfectly complete.

For a long moment, nothing moved.

Then, slowly, both figures lifted their heads.

Their eyes reflected the monitor’s light.

From their blackened mouths came the faintest whisper, perfectly synchronized:

Part I — The Arrival

The sand spread in a long pale curve beneath the cabin, smooth and wet from the retreating tide. The ocean stretched beyond it, iron gray under the overcast sky. A low wind came off the water carrying the scent of rot and salt. Hunter stood on the small deck and watched the waves break against the rock ledge below. He felt the tremor of them through the wood boards and tried to imagine the sand beneath the water, heavy and cold, pressed flat by the weight of the sea.

Isaiah was inside unpacking. Hunter could hear the dull thud of their bags and the hollow sound of the cupboards opening. The cabin had been closed for months. Dust drifted in the slanting light and every surface felt faintly damp. The place belonged to Isaiah’s uncle, a fisherman who had drowned years ago when his trawler went down just off the cove. Hunter had seen the memorial plaque nailed to the dock when they arrived. The metal had gone green around the edges.

They had come here to fix things, or at least that was what Isaiah had said. The city had become unbearable, the apartment too small, the arguments too frequent. Out here, Isaiah believed, they could start over. There was no one for miles, only the whisper of the tide and the endless sound of the surf against the rocks.

When Hunter finally went inside, the light had dimmed to a dull blue. Isaiah was in the kitchen washing a plate in the sink. The water ran rusty for a few seconds before clearing. The smell of iron filled the air. Isaiah turned and smiled faintly.

“Still works,” he said. “That’s a good sign.”

Hunter nodded. He ran a hand through his hair and looked around the cabin. There was one small bedroom, a sitting room with a couch that sagged in the middle, and a narrow hallway that led to a back door facing the dunes. Everything had a film of grit on it. A single picture hung above the fireplace showing a fishing boat being tossed on black water. The frame leaned slightly to one side.

They ate a small dinner of canned soup and bread. Isaiah talked more than Hunter did. He talked about the new start they needed, about how silence might help them find something that had been lost between them. Hunter listened but his eyes kept drifting to the window, to the line where the sea met the horizon. In the fading light the water looked like liquid metal. There was a faint shimmer in it that didn’t seem tied to the reflection of the sky.

That night they lay together in the narrow bed. The window above them had no curtain. Through it the moon was a dull white smudge behind the clouds. The waves came and went like a slow mechanical pulse. Hunter couldn’t sleep. Isaiah’s breathing was uneven beside him, shallow, catching now and then as if his lungs had forgotten the rhythm of rest. Hunter reached out and touched his shoulder, but Isaiah didn’t stir. His skin felt cooler than it should have.

Sometime near dawn Hunter dreamed that the tide rose higher than the beach, flooding the sand until it touched the steps of the cabin. He dreamed he was standing barefoot on the porch, water swirling around his ankles. Something moved beneath it, brushing against his skin. When he woke the sheets were damp with sweat and the air was thick with the scent of salt.

Outside, the sky was pale and colorless. Isaiah was already awake, sitting at the table with a mug of coffee. He was staring at nothing. The steam from the cup curled in front of his face.

“You were talking in your sleep,” Isaiah said quietly.

Hunter rubbed his eyes. “What did I say?”

Isaiah shrugged. “Something about the water. You kept saying not to look down.”

Hunter tried to laugh, but it came out dry. “Guess it’s already getting to me.”

Isaiah smiled faintly but didn’t answer.

They decided to walk the shoreline after breakfast. The tide was out, revealing long ribbons of kelp tangled in the sand. The air had that heavy stillness that comes before a storm. The cabin looked small and colorless against the gray dunes behind them. Hunter picked up a shell half buried near the water. The inside shimmered faintly, almost pearlescent. When he turned it, he saw that the inner surface wasn’t smooth. It had a pattern that looked like veins running in all directions.

Isaiah wandered ahead, his figure blurring in the mist. Hunter watched him move closer to the rocks where the waves hit hardest. A dark opening cut into the cliffside there, a kind of shallow cave. Isaiah called back that he was going to look inside. Hunter followed reluctantly, the wet sand sucking at his shoes.

The cave smelled of brine and decay. The walls were slick with algae and barnacles. Isaiah was crouched near the back where a pool of seawater had gathered in a hollow. He dipped his fingers in it and brought them to his lips before Hunter could stop him.

“What are you doing?” Hunter said sharply.

Isaiah laughed softly. “It tastes strange. Sweet almost.”

Hunter frowned. The water looked wrong. It was too dark, and something beneath the surface pulsed faintly, as if the pool had a heartbeat of its own.

“Let’s go,” Hunter said. “You’re going to make yourself sick.”

But Isaiah didn’t move. His expression had gone distant. “Do you hear that?” he whispered.

Hunter listened. At first there was only the echo of waves outside, but then, beneath it, a low humming sound seemed to rise from the stone. It was deep, resonant, like the vibration of something enormous moving far below. The air in the cave felt charged, the hairs on Hunter’s arms standing up.

“Come on,” Hunter said again, taking Isaiah’s arm. Isaiah blinked as if waking from a trance and followed him out.

The wind had picked up by the time they reached the cabin again. The ocean was darker now, streaked with whitecaps. Hunter couldn’t shake the feeling that the horizon had shifted slightly closer. Isaiah said he was fine, though his skin had a faint sheen of sweat and his eyes seemed glassy. He insisted it was just excitement from the walk.

By evening the rain began. It came in slow sheets, whispering against the windows. The lights flickered once but held. Hunter cooked what little food they had while Isaiah sat near the window, staring at the sea. Every few minutes he would reach up and rub at his throat like something irritated him.

When Hunter joined him, Isaiah leaned against him and said quietly, “I keep thinking about that pool. It felt alive.”

Hunter tried to smile. “It was just seawater.”

Isaiah shook his head. “No. There was something in it.”

Hunter didn’t answer. He wanted to tell Isaiah about the way the ground seemed to hum beneath his feet when they left the cave, but he didn’t. He didn’t want to feed it. The air inside the cabin was thick, damp, smelling faintly of seaweed though all the windows were closed.

They sat like that for a long time, the rain blurring the view outside into streaks of gray. Eventually Isaiah turned and kissed him. The kiss tasted faintly metallic. Hunter felt a warmth rise through him, heavy and slow, and then a strange pull in his chest, as if something inside him leaned toward Isaiah’s heartbeat.

When they broke apart Isaiah’s eyes were dilated. He smiled, but it didn’t look like him anymore. There was something hungry behind it. Hunter told himself it was just the dim light.

They went to bed early, though neither of them slept much. The storm grew louder through the night, waves crashing closer than before. At one point Hunter got up to check the door and saw water pooling at the edge of the steps. He couldn’t tell if the tide had risen or if the land itself had sunk slightly lower. The boards of the cabin groaned as if settling under a new weight.

When he turned back toward the bed, Isaiah was sitting up. The light from the window fell across his face, and for a second Hunter thought he saw thin lines tracing down his neck, like pale veins glowing faintly beneath the skin. Isaiah looked at him and said softly, “It’s in us now.”

Hunter stared at him. “What is?”

Isaiah blinked slowly. “The sea.”

Part II — The Change

Morning came as a dull gray light pressing through the clouds. The air inside the cabin was still heavy, tinged with the smell of salt and wood rot. Hunter woke first. The tide had receded, leaving long lines of dark kelp across the sand outside. The storm had scattered shells and driftwood along the beach. The horizon looked distorted, as if the ocean surface were slightly curved upward in the distance.

Isaiah lay beside him, motionless except for the slow rise and fall of his chest. His skin looked pale. The faint lines Hunter had seen the night before were still there, tracing delicate patterns down his neck and over his collarbone like fine cracks in porcelain. When Hunter touched them, Isaiah stirred and smiled without opening his eyes.

“Morning,” he whispered. His voice was hoarse.

“Are you alright?” Hunter asked.

“Just tired.”

Hunter went to boil water for coffee. The kettle took longer than it should have to heat. The flame on the old gas stove burned a sickly orange. When he poured the water into the mugs it smelled faintly briny, as though salt had crept into the plumbing. He tried not to think about it.

Isaiah sat at the table, rubbing his hands together. His nails looked darker, stained near the cuticles. Hunter noticed small cuts along his fingers, thin and symmetrical like scratches made by coral. Isaiah caught him staring and tucked his hands under the table.

“Must’ve scraped them on the rocks yesterday,” he said.

Hunter nodded but didn’t answer. His own throat felt dry. He drank the coffee and found it bitter, metallic, as if the water had drawn something from the pipes.

Outside, the wind had died but the sea still rolled heavily. They decided to walk again, staying close to the dunes. The sand was cold and firm under their feet. Sea foam clung to the edges of the waterline, forming shapes that dissolved as soon as Hunter tried to focus on them. Isaiah walked a few steps ahead, his posture rigid. Every now and then he would stop and tilt his head as if listening to something distant.

Hunter called to him, but Isaiah didn’t answer. He knelt near the surf, letting the waves break over his hands. When he stood again, water dripped down his wrists, thicker than it should have been, almost viscous. He watched it slide down his skin, fascinated.

“I can feel it moving,” Isaiah said quietly.

“What?”

“The water. Inside me.”

Hunter took a step back. “Isaiah, stop. You need to rest.”

Isaiah turned to him. His pupils were wide, swallowing most of the iris. “It’s not bad. It’s warm.”

He smiled again, but there was no warmth in it. Hunter felt a pressure behind his eyes, a subtle ache that pulsed in rhythm with the sound of the waves. He wanted to leave the beach, to go anywhere else, but Isaiah was already walking toward the rocks again. The entrance to the cave yawned black against the cliff.

“Don’t,” Hunter said, his voice sharper than he intended.

Isaiah paused. “It’s calling. You hear it too, don’t you?”

Hunter wanted to deny it, but there was a low hum in the air again, almost inaudible, just beneath the range of hearing. It vibrated in his teeth, in the bones of his jaw. The sound came from beneath the earth, or from beneath the sea itself. He felt it more than heard it.

Isaiah stepped into the cave. Hunter followed reluctantly.

The pool inside had changed. The water was no longer dark but clouded, swirling faintly even though nothing moved the surface. A faint glow came from its depths, pale and green. The light played across the slick walls, casting shifting shadows that looked like hands reaching.

Isaiah knelt beside it. “It’s beautiful.”

“Don’t touch it,” Hunter said, but Isaiah already had. He dipped both hands into the pool. The glow intensified. Ripples spread outward, touching the edges of the rock. The hum grew louder. Hunter stumbled back as the sound filled the small space.

Isaiah turned his head slowly. His skin was glistening now, covered in a sheen that looked like seawater but didn’t drip. It clung to him, transparent and quivering. When he spoke, his voice had a strange echo to it, as if another voice spoke a fraction of a second behind him.

“It’s part of us,” Isaiah said. “It’s what we came for.”

Hunter grabbed him by the arm and pulled him away from the pool. The surface stilled at once, the light fading until it was only murky water again. Isaiah’s arm was cold and slick beneath Hunter’s grip, but he followed without resistance. Outside, the air felt thin, almost too light to breathe. Hunter’s heart hammered as they climbed back toward the cabin.

Inside, Isaiah collapsed onto the couch. He looked feverish, his lips pale. Hunter wrapped him in a blanket and sat beside him, trying to ignore the faint dampness that seeped through the fabric. For a long time neither of them spoke. The sound of the surf filled the silence, slower now, like a heartbeat.

“I can feel it in you too,” Isaiah whispered. His eyes were half-lidded. “It’s not just me.”

Hunter shook his head. “You’re sick, that’s all.”

Isaiah smiled faintly. “Then you’re sick too.”

Hunter wanted to argue but found he couldn’t. His own skin felt clammy, the air against it too heavy. When he looked at his reflection in the window, he thought he saw something shift beneath the surface of his neck, a flicker of movement that vanished when he touched it.

He turned away and forced himself to focus on the mundane. He checked the cupboards, the generator, anything to keep his hands busy. But the hum was still there, faint and constant, threading through the silence like a pulse beneath the world.

By late afternoon Isaiah was asleep, his breathing shallow. Hunter sat beside him, watching the slow rise and fall of his chest. The faint lines on his neck had spread, branching outward. When Hunter brushed a strand of hair aside, he saw that the skin beneath was translucent. Beneath it something moved, a slow undulation like the rhythm of waves.

Hunter went outside to clear his head. The tide had risen again, farther than before. Foam lapped at the first steps of the porch. The sand beyond was littered with small fish that twitched weakly before going still. The air was perfectly still, no wind at all, yet the surface of the water trembled constantly, like the sea itself was breathing.

He looked toward the horizon. The line between water and sky had blurred. The ocean seemed to go on forever, no longer flat but curving upward as though it wanted to close around the world.

When he went back inside, Isaiah was gone.

The door to the back of the cabin stood open. Footprints led through the damp sand toward the dunes. Hunter followed, his heart hammering. The prints were shallow, filled with a faint shimmering liquid instead of water. He called Isaiah’s name but only the sound of the sea answered.

He found him near the edge of the dunes, kneeling. His clothes were soaked. He was staring at his hands, holding them up to the gray light. The skin there had thinned, and beneath it Hunter saw veins that shimmered faintly, like strands of silver.

“I can hear them,” Isaiah said without looking up.

“Hear who?”

“The ones below. They’re waiting.”

Hunter knelt beside him. “We need to go back inside.”

Isaiah turned his head slowly. His eyes caught the light in an unnatural way, reflecting it back like the surface of water. “You can’t run from something that’s already inside you.”

Hunter felt a wave of nausea. “You’re not making sense.”

Isaiah reached out and touched his face. The touch was cold, almost soothing. “You will. Soon.”

That night the storm returned, heavier than before. Rain lashed the windows. The power flickered and went out. The world outside was reduced to sound, the constant roar of the sea against the walls. Hunter lit the small oil lamp and sat by Isaiah’s side. The light flickered across his face, revealing the glistening sheen that now covered his skin entirely.

Isaiah shivered once, then exhaled a slow sigh. “It’s so close now.”

Hunter swallowed. “What is?”

Isaiah smiled. “Home.”

Hunter tried to wake him but he had already slipped into sleep, or something like it. His breathing slowed until it matched the rhythm of the waves. Hunter felt the same rhythm in his own chest, an involuntary syncopation that frightened him. He pressed his palm against his sternum and felt warmth radiate outward, a spreading heat that wasn’t entirely his own.

Hours passed. The rain softened. The only light came from the faint glow beneath Isaiah’s skin. It pulsed gently, casting shifting reflections on the walls. Hunter sat motionless, listening to the soft whisper of the sea against the door, and realized that he could understand it now. Not as words, but as meaning. It spoke of merging, of dissolution, of peace beyond separation. The sound filled his mind until he no longer knew if it was coming from outside or from within.

He closed his eyes, and in the darkness behind his eyelids he saw the same glow, vast and endless, spreading beneath the ocean floor. Shapes moved within it, immense and slow, their outlines fading into the distance. He felt their presence the way one feels the gravity of the earth, constant and inescapable.

When he opened his eyes again, the glow from Isaiah’s body had dimmed, but a faint trace of it lingered in the air between them, a mist that shimmered before fading. Hunter reached out instinctively. The mist clung to his fingers, cold and wet, then sank into his skin without a trace.

A deep vibration rolled through the floorboards, subtle but unmistakable, as if something vast had shifted far below. The oil lamp flickered once and went out.

Hunter sat in the darkness, listening to the sound of the sea pressing closer.

Part III — The Merging

The morning arrived without light. A dense fog pressed against the windows, pale and motionless. The sound of the ocean was no longer rhythmic but constant, a deep, unbroken roar that filled the cabin. It was as if the sea had moved closer during the night and now breathed just beyond the walls.

Hunter woke on the floor beside the couch. He couldn’t remember lying down. The boards beneath him were cold and faintly damp. Isaiah was still asleep, wrapped in the blanket. The glow beneath his skin had faded to a dim shimmer, yet his breathing carried a strange resonance, as though air passed through water inside his chest.

When Hunter sat up, his joints cracked softly. A film of moisture coated his arms. He wiped it away, but his skin stayed slick, no matter how many times he dried it. He could feel his pulse, not as a single beat but as a current flowing beneath his flesh.

He stood and walked to the window. The fog outside was thick enough to hide the shore. Only a faint motion revealed the sea beyond, a slow undulation that blurred the line between land and water. He thought he could see the outline of something beneath the surface, moving parallel to the coast. It was too large to be a wave.

Behind him, Isaiah stirred.

Hunter turned. Isaiah’s eyes were open, reflecting the pale fog light. His voice came out softer than before, yet it carried the same echo that had haunted the cave.

“It’s changing,” Isaiah whispered. “Everything is.”

Hunter knelt beside him. “We need to leave. The tide’s coming in too high. The road will flood.”

Isaiah smiled faintly. “There’s nowhere to go.”

He reached for Hunter’s hand. His touch was cold but alive, thrumming with some internal rhythm. Beneath his skin, faint patterns shifted like the movement of fish in shallow water. Hunter pulled back instinctively, but Isaiah’s fingers lingered against his wrist. A warmth spread from the contact, traveling up his arm in a slow pulse.

Hunter gasped and stumbled to his feet. The warmth didn’t fade; it deepened, twisting inside him until it became a pressure in his chest. He pressed his palm against his ribs and felt something move beneath them—a faint flexing that wasn’t his heartbeat.

Isaiah rose too, unsteady but calm. “You feel it, don’t you?” he said. “It’s what connects us.”

Hunter backed away. “You’re sick. Both of us are. It’s that water. We just need to—”

“Stop pretending,” Isaiah said. “It doesn’t hurt if you stop fighting.”

Hunter shook his head. “You don’t know what it’s doing to you.”

Isaiah stepped forward. The fog light caught his face, revealing subtle changes that Hunter hadn’t noticed before. The planes of his features had softened, as though something beneath his skin had begun to reshape him. His pupils shone faintly. There was a stillness to his movements that didn’t belong to any living thing.

He lifted his hand and placed it against Hunter’s chest. “Listen,” he said.

Hunter froze. Beneath Isaiah’s palm he felt the faint thrum of his own heart, but also something else—a vibration that matched Isaiah’s pulse perfectly. For a moment the two rhythms aligned, beating together. The pressure in his chest lessened, replaced by a strange calm. The fear that had driven him seemed to dissolve, leaving behind only a dull awe.

Isaiah leaned closer until their foreheads touched. His breath smelled faintly of the sea. “It’s not trying to hurt us,” he whispered. “It wants us whole.”

The calm shattered. Hunter pulled back sharply. The contact broke, and the pressure inside him returned with a violent surge. He stumbled against the wall, gasping. A dull ache spread through his limbs, heavy and wet. His vision blurred. For an instant the cabin tilted, as if the floor had turned to liquid.

When the dizziness passed, he found Isaiah watching him with an unreadable expression.

“It’s already begun,” Isaiah said softly.

Hunter fell to his knees. He wanted to argue, to say something rational, but the words dissolved before reaching his mouth. He could feel the sea inside him—the push and pull of tides beneath his ribs, the faint echo of waves in his pulse. The sound filled his head, drowning out thought.

He stayed there for what felt like hours, breathing shallowly, waiting for it to stop. It never did.

By the time he could stand again, the fog had darkened to silver. The air vibrated faintly, a pressure that seemed to come from the ground. Isaiah was standing near the window, his hands pressed against the glass. The moisture from his palms left faint trails that glowed for a moment before fading.

“They’re close,” Isaiah said.

“Who?” Hunter asked, his voice weak.

“The ones beneath. The ones that remember.”

Hunter stared at him. The glow from Isaiah’s hands had left faint shapes on the windowpane—spirals, ridges, and branching lines that looked eerily similar to the patterns now spreading across his skin. It wasn’t random. It looked deliberate, as if drawn by instinct rather than thought.

The hum in the floor deepened. The cabin shuddered once, then stilled. From outside came the muffled sound of water against the steps. Hunter turned toward the door. A thin line of seawater was seeping under it, spreading slowly across the boards.

He grabbed their bags, but when he opened the door, the world beyond was gone. The fog had swallowed everything. The beach, the dunes, even the horizon—all erased. Only the faint suggestion of motion beneath the white surface revealed the sea’s presence.

He took a step forward. The air felt heavy, damp, almost fluid. His foot sank slightly, not into sand, but into something softer, pliant. When he lifted it, a faint glistening film stretched and broke between his shoe and the ground.

“Hunter,” Isaiah said behind him, “don’t.”

Hunter turned. Isaiah stood framed in the doorway, the light from the fog illuminating him. His expression was peaceful, almost reverent. The patterns beneath his skin had spread fully now, tracing his arms, his throat, his chest. Each line pulsed faintly, in rhythm with the low sound rising from beneath the earth.

“I see them,” Isaiah said. “They’re waiting just below.”

“Come back inside,” Hunter said, but his voice sounded far away.

Isaiah stepped past him, barefoot, walking toward the fog. The water reached his ankles, then his knees. Each step left a faint trail of light that faded almost instantly. Hunter moved to follow, but his legs felt heavy, as if the air itself resisted him.

“Isaiah!” he shouted. The fog swallowed the name.

For a moment Isaiah’s shape was visible ahead, then it blurred. The mist around him shifted like breath. Hunter thought he saw another figure there, vast and half-seen, its outline rippling through the fog like something beneath the surface of a pond. Then both shapes dissolved.

The roar of the ocean intensified, no longer distant but surrounding him. The ground trembled. Hunter staggered back toward the cabin, but the doorframe warped beneath his hand. The wood was soft and slick. He pushed harder and it gave way, crumbling like wet paper. Inside, the floor was covered in a thin layer of water, reflecting the dim gray light.

He fell to his knees. The reflection of the ceiling above him shimmered, but in it he didn’t see his own face. The reflection looked back with Isaiah’s eyes.

The sight broke something in him. He clutched his head and gasped. His heartbeat raced, then stuttered. Beneath his palms, his skin felt loose, as though the structure beneath it were shifting. A low ringing filled his ears, rising until it was almost musical.

When he opened his eyes again, Isaiah was standing in front of him, dripping with seawater. His expression was serene.

“You don’t have to fight,” Isaiah said.

Hunter shook his head weakly. “You’re not real.”

Isaiah knelt beside him. “I am. And so are you. We’re the same now.”

He reached out. Hunter tried to pull away, but Isaiah’s hand met his chest, and the resistance vanished. The touch was neither solid nor fluid; it passed through the surface of his skin like mist through glass. Warmth flooded Hunter’s body, filling every hollow place. The ache, the fear, the confusion—all dissolved in that warmth.

He saw Isaiah’s face close to his own, but it wasn’t just a face anymore. It was shifting, merging, reflecting his own features and losing them again in a slow tide of motion. Their outlines blurred where they touched. The air around them thickened, carrying a faint light. The hum that had haunted the cabin rose into a single clear note, vibrating through every cell of Hunter’s body.

He tried to breathe and realized he didn’t need to. The air entered him without effort, as if his lungs had already opened to the sea. His skin tingled. The boundary between his flesh and Isaiah’s seemed to dissolve entirely. There was no pain—only the overwhelming sense of release, of weightlessness, of something vast pressing close.

The note held, growing softer but deeper, like the echo of an immense heartbeat somewhere far below. The walls of the cabin trembled. Water seeped up through the floorboards, climbing around them in slow rings. The last thing Hunter saw clearly was Isaiah’s eyes—calm, luminous, filled with the reflection of a world beyond sight.

Then everything folded inward. The room, the fog, the light—all collapsed into the sound of waves, endless and patient.

Part IV – The Descent

The water rose faster than Hunter could think. He didn’t remember falling or standing — one moment he was on the cabin floor, the next, the world tilted, and the sea was there, pouring through the door in a single unbroken sheet. It was no longer waves or tide. It was one continuous movement, as if the ocean had decided to rise.

He stumbled for the table, but it drifted sideways, caught in the slow current filling the room. Isaiah’s voice came faintly through the noise — low, calm, reverent.

“It’s not taking us,” Isaiah said. “It’s calling us.”

The sound of his voice carried through the water like a vibration rather than speech. Each word trembled in Hunter’s chest as much as in his ears. He turned toward the doorway where Isaiah stood half-submerged, his shoulders lit by a pale light that didn’t seem to come from the sky.

“Isaiah, we have to get out,” Hunter said, but the words were swallowed instantly. The water was already to his waist. Coldness sank into his bones; every movement felt slowed by the thick weight pressing against him.

Isaiah didn’t answer. He was looking past Hunter, toward the window, where something enormous moved beneath the surface outside. The glass flexed inward slightly, as if breathing. A shadow passed across it — not a shape, but an absence, darker than the sea itself.

Then the window cracked.

The noise was small, a whisper, followed by another. The cracks spread like veins, webbing outward. Hunter lunged for Isaiah, but the window gave way with a deep, soft sound — not a crash, not even a splash, just surrender. Water folded inward, and the world inverted.

He was pulled under before he could breathe. The shock of salt filled his nose and throat. The world became gray motion and pressure. He couldn’t tell where the surface was — only that everything was falling, turning, collapsing. For a long moment there was no up or down, only the pulse of his heart and the endless rumble around him.

When he opened his eyes, the light was dim but steady. The cabin was gone. Only fragments drifted — boards, the shape of a door, the outline of Isaiah moving slowly in the suspended debris. The sea around them was almost still, lit by a faint glow that seemed to come from below.

Hunter kicked toward him, struggling through the thick water. Every stroke felt heavy, as if the ocean had weight beyond measure. The light grew brighter as he moved, and the space around them widened, revealing what lay beneath.

It wasn’t the ocean floor. It was something else — an expanse of pale surface, smooth and curved, vanishing into shadow on all sides. It pulsed faintly, like the slow rise and fall of breathing. The glow came from within it, rhythmic, patient.

Isaiah drifted downward toward it, arms open, hair floating around his head like a dark halo. Hunter tried to shout, but only bubbles escaped. He reached out, caught Isaiah’s wrist — and the contact burned cold. The skin beneath his fingers was too soft, the texture yielding like something that wasn’t flesh anymore. Isaiah turned toward him. His expression was serene, eyes bright with reflected light.

“It’s not death,” his voice said, though his lips didn’t move. “It’s the beginning.”

Hunter shook his head, bubbles streaming upward. He wanted to pull away, but Isaiah’s hand tightened around his arm, pulling him closer. The light beneath them brightened again, and the surface below began to open — not breaking, but parting, like fabric being drawn aside.

Beyond it was darkness. Not black, but depth — endless and waiting.

The water around them stirred. The current pulled gently, then firmly, until Hunter’s legs were caught. He tried to kick free, but the motion only drew him faster. The pull wasn’t suction; it was gravity inverted, something vast deciding his direction.

He looked back once. Isaiah was no longer fighting. He let the current take him, drifting downward with open eyes and parted lips. The light from below painted his face silver. For a moment, Hunter saw movement behind him — faint shapes sliding just beneath the surface, circling, converging.

Then Isaiah was gone, swallowed by the dark.

Hunter’s chest burned. Instinct screamed for air, but the pressure was too much; his body refused to obey. He kicked again, desperate, but the current only grew stronger. The light flared once more, then dimmed, pulsing in time with his heartbeat. He felt it behind his eyes, in his teeth, inside the marrow of his bones.

Something touched his shoulder. Not a hand. It was softer, larger — a smooth pressure that settled there gently, almost kindly. Another touch followed on his back, then his side. He couldn’t see them, but he could feel them tracing him, mapping the outline of his body as if learning it.

He tried to scream, and the sound became a vibration in the water, echoing back from all sides. The light below responded, brightening again until it filled everything. The pressure increased, and with it came a deep sound — a low, resonant hum that he felt through every nerve.

It wasn’t a voice. It was older than that. But it spoke in a way his body understood.

Join.

The word wasn’t a command. It was inevitability. His body answered before his mind could. The pain of his lungs disappeared. The need for air dissolved. The cold no longer felt cold. The distinction between his limbs and the water blurred. The current no longer pulled him; it moved through him.

He saw Isaiah again ahead, floating in the light. His outline was changing, the edges softening, merging with the glow. Hunter reached for him, but his arm no longer obeyed. It moved too smoothly, too fluidly. When he looked down, his own skin had taken on the same faint shimmer that Isaiah’s had. The light came from within now.

He tried to think of the surface — the cabin, the shore, the sky. But the memories were already fading. The light below pulsed again, and with each pulse, his thoughts scattered a little more. He could feel them leaving him, dissolving into the rhythm of the sea.

The last thing he saw before the light swallowed everything was Isaiah’s face turning toward him one final time. The features were barely human now, eyes wide and depthless, filled with reflected motion. His mouth formed a word Hunter couldn’t hear, but he felt it vibrate through the water — through himself.

Together.

The hum deepened. The pressure built until it became weightless, sound and motion fusing into one continuous vibration. Hunter tried to move, but movement no longer meant anything. His body expanded, broke apart, and reformed in the same instant. The light filled him completely, and for one heartbeat, he felt the enormity of what lay below: countless forms moving in silence, all bound by the same rhythm.

Then there was nothing — no thought, no self, no Hunter. Only the pulse of the ocean and the endless voice beneath it, steady and eternal, whispering in every direction.

We are.

The sea closed over everything.

And it was very, very quiet.

Rumor has it that there was a sign posted on somewhere in the barracks to have troops take their A/C units out of their windows or that they will turn off the hot water. People still haven’t taken the units out yet.

If the problem persists, do I have any kind of fight in this matter or do I just have to embrace the cold until it comes back on?

If your goal is to push extraction, as I think it should be, solubles dissolve better in hotter water, that's a fact. As far as I'm concerned, you want your water as hot as you can get it if you want to get the most out of your coffee.

1phe4va,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryshortstories/comments/1phe4va/afterlife_death/,Afterlife Death,"“This can’t be right,” I said, my eyes glued to my iMac, my coffee-lifting arm frozen midair. I was in the study, wherein I’d spent the better part of a month scrutinizing job listings, afore a desktop buried under bite-sized candy bar wrappers.

 

“What can’t be right?” asked my wife, Beatrice, from just over my shoulder. Since my layoff, her pretty face had sprouted three new wrinkles—deep ones—and her incessant nagging was the only thing keeping me from the couch, from watching ESPN until my eyes bled. Her job as a telecom sales rep barely covered her wardrobe requirements, after all, and our savings would only stretch so far before we lost the house. 

 

“This listing. No way can it be legitimate.”

 

“What’s it say?”

 

I swiveled in my seat, to stare into those chestnut-colored eyes of hers. It seemed that she’d been crying. Anxiously, she finger-scrunched her black bob cut. 

 

“It says that the research and development division of some company—Investutech, I guess it’s called—will pay $10,000 to anyone who lets the company claim their body after death.”

 

“So they pay you now, even though it might take you decades to die?”

 

“It appears so.”

 

Softly laughing, she shook her skeptical head. “Yeah, that’s *gotta be* a scam. But then again, it can’t hurt to call the number.”

 

“You’re serious? You want me to call these guys?” 

 

Before I could blink, Beatrice had the phone in my hand.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Investutech’s R&D facility epitomized modern architecture: a massive cube of steel and glass, unadorned and soulless. In its lobby, I met Dr. Vern Landon, Lab Supervisor. A short, bald fellow disappearing into his own liver spots, the good doctor shook my hand as if attempting to crush a spider between our palms.

 

“Thanks for coming down,” he said. “I know we’re somewhat off the beaten path, but that’s how corporate prefers it.”

 

“It’s no problem.”

 

“You’re here about the Internet listing, I understand.”

 

“Yeah…it’s some kind of scam, right?”

 

“Quite the opposite, my friend. At this establishment, we seek nothing less than world-shattering scientific innovation. In this pursuit, we use every tool obtainable, even the dead ones. To those of a scientific bent, a fresh corpse offers a cornucopia of potential knowledge.”

 

“Huh?”

 

“Some experiments are too risky to use a living human as a test subject, and lab monkeys don’t always cut the mustard. Perhaps you’d like an example. Well, when developing a medical device, we can insert it into a deceased man or woman to ensure that everything fits where it’s supposed to. We also harvest organs for tissue engineering projects.”

 

“Tissue engineering?”

 

“Yeah, buddy. Right now, we’re learning to create artificial and bioartificial organs for patients awaiting transplants. We also use cadavers in all sorts of genetic engineering projects.”  

 

Gently gripping my arm, Dr. Landon herded me down the corridor. “Come along now,” he said. “I’ll give you the grand tour.”

 

We passed a cafeteria, wherein a handful of sad-faced individuals in lab coats sat at Formica tables, silently consuming their lunches. As we walked, my guide began orating:

 

“Investutech is the number one innovator in a wide range of fields—from mainstream consumer technology to the wildest of fringe sciences. In fact, there are facilities like this spread all across the United States, answerable only to Investutech’s board of directors. At this location alone, we have laboratories dedicated not only to biomedical engineering, but also to physics, biology, and even psychology. We are engaged in many exciting projects here, which I’m unfortunately unable to speak of. Here’s the elevator. Why don’t we hop aboard?”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

While I didn’t get the whole run of the facility, I saw enough to be suitably impressed. Many doors were closed to us, requiring security clearance denied to visitors. I did, however, get to see a particle accelerator, located in an extensive, circular tunnel beneath the facility. The device’s beam pipe resembled something from a sci-fi flick, as if light cycle races could take place inside it. Naturally, I requested to see the thing in action—propelling particles at nearly the speed of light—but the doctor assured me it wasn’t possible.

 

The labs I visited were practically identical: workbenches and cabinets, sinks and tables, notebooks filled with incomprehensible jottings. In some corners, I saw containers marked with radioactive waste tags. 

 

In one laboratory, I was introduced to the jubilant Dr. Hegseth. Rotund and mottled, the man handed me a pill bottle labeled *6/7.9*. 

 

“What’s this?” I asked.

 

“Have you ever gone to the movies after getting good and smashed at the nearest bar?” 

 

“Why, yes, I suppose I have.”

 

“It’s great, isn’t it? In fact, the practice has gotten me through many an evening with the missus. The only drawback is the inevitable bathroom break, during which you could be missing the movie’s best scenes.”

 

“Yeah…what’s your point?”

 

“Well, each of those pills affects your system like a six-pack of strong beer. You can get as drunk as you like and never have to pee once. Pop a pill or two and you’re ready to sit through even the most insipid romantic comedy. Best of all, you won’t be burning off your date’s eyelashes with a blast of dragon breath.”

 

Thinking it over, I had to admit that the innovation intrigued me. 

 

“Keep the bottle,” Dr. Hegseth said. “They hit the market next month.”

 

Dr. Landon led me further down the corridor. Passing a number of simulation-running supercomputers, we arrived at the psychologists’ labs: austere rooms featuring one-way mirrors and hidden cameras, allowing one to observe the behavior of human test subjects. Only one room was occupied. Imagine my surprise when Dr. Landon whipped out his security card and ushered me inside it.

 

In one corner of the room, sitting with his knees pressing his chest, was a bearded man in a hockey jersey and soiled blue jeans. He stared without seeing, rarely blinking, spittle spilling from his mouth corners. *Does he even register my presence?* I wondered. For a moment, his face seemed to contort into a terror mask…but then his mouth slackened again, and I had to wonder if I’d imagined the expression change. 

 

“This is Ruben,” my guide informed me. “He’s the last of our Nonlinears.”

 

“Nonlinears?” I asked.

 

“How can I explain this to you? Basically, our brains are filled with these cells called neurons—around 100 billion of them, supposedly—which process and transmit information all day long. Each neuron is electrochemically linked to at least 20,000 other neurons, sending and receiving signals through synapse connections. If not for them, our minds wouldn’t function properly.

 

“With the Nonlinears, we did a little brain tinkering, blasting their temporal lobes with intense dopamine bombardments to unlink the neurons associated with linear time perception. We weren’t sure what would happen, but the results defied all hypotheses.”

 

“What happened?” I asked, astounded.

 

“We discovered that by unlinking these selected neurons, we altered their time perception beyond anything we could’ve imagined. In fact, the tragic bastards ended up living every moment of their lives from that point onward simultaneously, all the way up to their deaths.”

 

“That’s amazing.”

 

“You’d think so, but experiencing a lifetime of sensations all at once is too much for *anyone* to process. That’s why Ruben doesn’t move. We feed him and clean him because he’s trying to do as little as possible, to limit his movement and sensations to a manageable level. He’ll likely remain that way until he expires, the poor guy.”

 

“So, what happened to the rest of the Nonlinears?”

 

“Some had immediate heart attacks, the sensation onslaught being too intense for their autonomic nervous systems. Some succumbed to brain aneurisms. The rest committed suicide in the most gruesome way imaginable, bashing their heads against the walls until their skulls caved in.”

 

“Good lord.”

 

“Only Ruben had the foresight to claim a corner for his own. Who knows what’s happening in that manic brain of his? Every communication attempt has been a failure thus far, just like the experiment itself.” 

 

The doctor ushered me out. “Well, that about concludes the tour. I could show you the bacteriology and virology labs, but you’d have to put on a biocontaminant suit before entering, and then take a chemical shower, followed by a regular shower, before leaving. It’s not worth the effort, trust me.”

 

“No problem. My mind’s blown already.”  

 

“Of course it is,” he chuckled. “So…have you made a decision? You’ve seen what we do here. Will you sell us your corpse?”

 

“For ten grand, it’s a no brainer,” I replied.

 

“Great! Step into my office and we’ll fill out all of the necessary paperwork. We’ll cut you a check and let you get back to your life.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Two weeks later, my wife and I were eating portabello tatin at a quaint French bistro. Sucking down Pierre Ponnelle Pinot Noir by the glassful, we contemplated a getaway cruise to the Bahamas. 

 

The check had cleared, and life was grand. No longer did we argue about money; no longer did I power through bags of miniature candy bars at my desk, searching in vain for a job that never existed. The ten grand would run out eventually, but until then I wasn’t going to let life get me down.

 

My wife made a joke. Laughing uproariously, I accidentally knocked over my wine. Dabbing it up with a napkin, I regretted popping a *6/7.9* pill before dinner, which had left me buzzed immaculate, just a stone’s throw away from drunk. I didn’t want to embarrass Beatrice, not when things were going so well. 

 

Neither of us desired dessert, so with our plates mostly emptied, I signaled for the check. Tipping the waiter a magnanimous twenty-five percent, I took my wife by the elbow and escorted her from the restaurant, into the sun-drenched day. There was a park across the street, a grass field framed with benches, containing no less than twelve picnic tables. To prolong our love’s rekindling, I suggested that we grab a bench, to watch a Hispanic family play croquet. 

 

“That sounds nice, dear,” Beatrice cooed, giving my hand a tender squeeze. I felt a decade younger, like it was our first date all over again, and it was going better than I’d hoped for. When the little green man appeared at the other end of the crosswalk, we strode forward leisurely, eyeing each other, not the surrounding traffic. 

 

Just as we passed the median strip, tragedy struck. At the sound of a horn blare, I glanced up to see a green Chevy Nova flying down the left-hand turn lane. Perhaps its bug-eyed driver hadn’t noticed the red light, or perhaps he didn’t care. Either way, I had just enough time to push my wife behind me, just enough time to brace for impact. With a great crumpling, I found myself ground under the vehicle’s polished metal grille.

 

I felt my bones grind and splinter, my liver burst. Drowning on lifeblood, I watched the world cloud over. Dying, I tried to speak Beatrice’s name, succeeding only in vomiting blood and bile onto the asphalt. 

 

Then I was gone, breeze-borne into oblivion. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When next my eyes opened, I beheld neither Heaven nor Hell—no harp-strumming angels, no demons cavorting around a lake of fire. Instead, I found myself strapped to a metal table in one of Investutech’s psychology labs, with a shorthaired Asian American doctor attempting to blind me with a penlight. 

 

“He’s awake, Dr. Landon,” the man announced.

 

In the background stood my erstwhile tour guide—smiling benevolently, sweat beads dotting his brow. “Welcome back, my friend,” he said. “I trust that you remember me.”

 

“Whaaa…haaapened?” I wheezed, my voice like a broken lawnmower. My skin was cold. I felt metal rods inside of me, where my bones had been. My outfit consisted of a hospital gown over thick layers of bandages. Even without drugs, there was no discomfort. It was like all of my pain receptors had been switched off. 

 

“There’s no other way to tell you but to leap right in,” said Landon, struggling for a soothing tone. “You were run over by a car in the middle of an intersection. You pushed your wife to safety, but lost your life in the process. In fact, your funeral started five minutes ago. They’re burying an empty coffin, however, as you signed your body over to us.”

 

“Youuu…brought meee baack.”

 

“We sure did. In fact, you’ve become the culmination of all our work at this facility. Most of your organs were ruined, so our tissue engineering division grew you new ones. A good portion of your skeleton was shattered, so we grafted steel bones into your physique. After that, with a strenuous application of galvanism, we actually brought the life spark back to your body. Your heart’s beating, and your neurons fire again. Now, if we can just figure out a way to stop the decay process, you’ll be good as new. You may even return to your wife someday.”

 

“Ah’m decaaaying?”

 

“Unfortunately, yes. It seems that your body doesn’t realize that it’s alive again. But our biomedical engineers are on the case, positing thermoregulation strategies even now. They should have your body generating heat again in no time.” 

 

“Whaaas wrong wiith my voiiiice?”

 

“Well, my friend, you did crack your head pretty hard on that crosswalk. Obviously, the trauma affected your brain’s language center. Once we stop the decay, perhaps we’ll look into repairing it.”

 

“Whyee am I straaapped doown?”

 

“Oh, that’s just a precaution. We’ve never tried something like this before, and had no idea what you’d be like upon waking. Dr. Lee, free our guest from his bonds, will you?”

 

The doctor did as instructed, allowing me to test my reflexes. They seemed unnaturally slow, as if the connection between my mind and musculature was on a time delay. After what felt like an hour, I *finally* slid my legs over the table and lurched to standing.

 

“Steady, steady,” Dr. Lee cautioned. “We don’t want you toppling over.”

 

Attempting to walk, I found my legs insensible. Indeed, I toppled forward. Fortunately, Dr. Lee was kind enough to catch me. 

 

“I warned you about that,” he grumbled, straining to brace me up. “Next time, we’ll…arggh!”

 

His screams were deafening. Groggily, I realized the source of his discomfort. For some reason, my body—operating on pure instinct—had me biting deep into Lee’s neck, gnawing frantically, my mouth filling with arterial blood. I was repulsed, yet couldn’t stop myself. A powerful appetite suffused me; it seemed it would never abate. 

 

Eventually, Lee’s screams faded. Landon tugged the corpse from my grip and I lurched in pursuit, tripping into a face plant. Losing consciousness, I heard the door slam behind them, locking me in my cell. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

For a while, I lurked in solitude, though I sensed observers just beyond the one-way glass. Time lost all meaning, as I no longer required sleep. Though I drank nothing, I felt no thirst, only that damnable hunger, that yearning for human flesh.   

 

With no entertainment options, I spent my time relearning to walk. It was more of a shamble, actually, as my knees refused to bend. Afterwards, I watched my body putrefy. 

 

First, my lower abdomen turned green. Then, in an embarrassing display, every bodily fluid, every bit of fecal matter, poured out of me. My face swelled balloonlike: mouth, lips, and tongue practically bursting. The swelling made even slurred speech impossible, garbling my every vocalization into soft moaning. 

 

My veins sprouted red tendrils, which later went green. Blisters erupted everywhere, suppurating pale, yellow fluid. Even my skin and hair began sloughing away. I won’t even mention the smell.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When Dr. Landon finally reappeared, this time flanked by two armed guards, I was in full-on undead mode. Landon offered no reaction to my appearance, but his eyes were sad. Gone was the jovial tour guide I remembered, replaced by a man who looked two decades older. Nauseous, the guards squinted at me, Glock 22s at the ready.

 

“Guuuuuhhhh,” I said, the best salutation I could manage under the circumstances. 

 

“Guh right back,” replied Landon. He hesitated for a moment, his face slackening sorrowfully. Regaining his composure, he said, “Well…I have some bad news, buddy. Because you slaughtered Dr. Lee, no scientist will go near you. This means that all efforts to stop, and even reverse, your decay have been suspended. In fact, Investutech’s board of directors has proposed returning you to the grave, allowing us to study your brain postmortem. Hopefully, we’ll be able to identify what prompted your blood lust and correct it before our next test subject arrives.”

 

“Nnnnnn.”

 

“I’m sorry, but that’s the situation. The final decision has yet to arrive, but I wouldn’t get your hopes up. The next time we enter your cell, it’ll most likely be to put you down. If it’s any consolation, though, your wife knows nothing of this. To her, you’ve been dead all this time. If Beatrice saw you now, who knows what it would do to her?”

 

The doctor’s practiced indifference disintegrated, as hoarse sobs burst through his quivering lips. Spilling tears, he exited the room, with both escorts trailing behind him. “I’m so sorry!” Landon called back, just before the door closed.

 

Starving and depressed, I threw myself from wall to wall. *I should’ve eaten all three of them when I had the chance*, I reasoned. *I’m already deadish. What could their guns possibly do to me?* Beneath the stained, tattered mess of my hospital gown, most of my bandages had peeled away. With every wall collision, my putrid body discharged flesh chunks, which only increased my agitation. Eventually, I collapsed, howling at the top of what was left of my lungs.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Time crawled interminably. My body dried out—darkening, acquiring a texture like cottage cheese—as its terrible death stench subsided. Internally, I visualized maggots wriggling throughout my organs, feasting on necrotic tissue. 

 

My shambling slowed, every step now a struggle. I have no idea what kept me ambulatory, kept my tormented spirit inside its moldering frame. Perhaps dark sorcery was involved.

 

Finally, Dr. Landon reappeared, accompanied by four guards this time, all with weapons drawn. “Well, my boy, the end has come,” he informed me. “I’d have brought a priest to pray over your immortal soul, but lab security doesn’t permit faith-mongers. Once again, I’d like to apologize for your situation. Sometimes good intentions breed monsters; sometimes all you can do is cut your losses and try to learn from your mistakes. Goodbye, my friend.”

 

The guards opened fire, sending a bullet spray through my torso, legs and arms. Feeling no pain, I stepped forward to meet them, as fragments of my living corpse splattered the floor behind me.

 

“It’s not working!” shouted one guard—a mulleted, red-faced ginger—right before I tore his head off. 

 

“Mmmmmwwwwah,” I moaned, reveling in the blood spray, wondering where my prodigious strength came from. It almost equaled my hunger. 

 

The next guard, I ripped his gun away, along with the arm holding it. In shock, his eyes rolling back into his skull, the brawny fellow dropped to his knees. 

 

I cracked the third guard’s cranium clean open. Consuming warm blood and squishy clumps of cerebral cortex, I would’ve slobbered, had my salivary glands still been operational. 

 

Dr. Landon, grasping the situation’s severity, turned on his heels and sprinted out of the room, hooking a right down the corridor. Naturally, I gave pursuit, pausing only to disembowel the fourth guard. 

 

Bloodlust lent new strength to my shamble. Resembling a mentally disabled child skipping, I positively flew down the hall. Catching up to Landon, I found him collapsed, hand to chest, gasping with an ashen face. Before the heart attack could claim him, I dashed his brains onto the floor and began to feed. 

 

With the doctor’s corpse picked clean, I grabbed his security clearance card and went back for the guards. Not that I was still hungry, mind you, but when visiting a buffet, you expect to gorge yourself.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Sirens blared overhead. Startled, I paused, clenching a dripping tendon between my teeth. They’d be coming for me, I realized, most likely in numbers I couldn’t fight through. Still, I had Landon’s key card and a memory of a fellow detainee: Ruben, the Nonlinear.

 

Two doors down the hall, I buzzed myself in. Ruben raised his eyes as I entered. I knew that this time he was really seeing me.

 

“You’re finally here,” he said, unafraid. 

 

“Ynnnnnn,” I confirmed, closing the intervening distance. 

 

My chin slick with the blood of my captors, I leaned over the Nonlinear. As my teeth met his flesh, he had just enough time to thank me. Then came gunfire and bloodletting, great gore eruptions amid a soundtrack of shrieking. The world began dimming; a red curtain closed.",1,1765205045.0,scaryshortstories,0,1.0,False

1phe3mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhR4Dating/comments/1phe3mr/29_m4f_hyroxrunning_dates_long_post/,29 [M4F] Hyrox/Running Dates (Long Post),"I’m also looking for someone who’d be down to join Hyrox or trail runs with me next year. It doesn’t matter if you’re a beginner or seasoned runner, as long as you enjoy the challenge and the vibe. If you like staying active and want a partner for races, long runs, or getting lost on mountain trails, then we’re already off to a good start.

Anyways, here’s my story:

Once upon a time, there was a tall, nerd, and not-much attractive guy *pero pwede na* who woke up one morning, looked at the sky, and thought, ""Well, this sucks."" He knew there was only one solution - to turn to the all-knowing oracle of modern dating: T̶i̶n̶d̶e̶r̶ Reddit lol.

With his trusty cup of sea salt coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' and ‘wholesome’ dates (whatever that means). He wasn't in a rush to jump into anything too serious too soon, but he knew that someday, he wanted to find someone he could build a meaningful and caring partnership.

So if you’re into third wave coffee, perpetual curiosity, and the full spectrum of nerdy pursuits, this particular vertical human might be worth your time. Dating really does feel like job hunting sometimes, doesn’t it? LOL! You either get guys who hasn’t moved on with their exes, who sends nsfw stuff right away or you get a friendly one so I figured why not lean into the absurdity and write this like a bloody resume. The joke entertained me, at least.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

##About me

An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into small business and investments, 2nd year law student (took a LOA atm), can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck lol (/s towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex-cheating issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no jowa (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha). Last relationship (6 years) was 3 years ago and dated someone last year but didn’t worked out.

- I'm 5'9"", physically fit and active, resides in QC. I would say that average level attractive yet clean and very hygienic

- I'm an INTJ-T Arch, Aries, if you’re into MBTI and believes in that people only have 12 personalities.

- Loves to read history, finance and self-help books not because I’m smart rich but I believe about continous learning and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as really awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set long-term feasible goals and actively pursue them.

##Here's a list of my favorites:
Movies/Series | Music | Places | Activities | Books

Godfather | Radiohead | Paris | Cycling | The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday
Sherlock | Eraserheads | Coffee Shops | Painting | How to Win Friends & Influence People

##Pros:

- Respoņsible (Good credit score, no debts, no criminal records, and self-reliant)

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

- Respects your views and accept healthy criticism. Respects personal space and time

- Actually appreciating the things you'll do for me, and showing it. If you cooked a big dinner, saying thank you is nice. Doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen is even nicer, and in my opinion, should be the norm. The cook doesn't clean. If someone does something for me, I'll show them that their effort was appreciated instead of just accepting their generosity and then running off back to whatever I'm doing.

- Accepts respònsibility or has accountability for one's own action and does not try to blame everything or everyone else. 

- No addiction/s, drugs, tattoos and not into online games

##My preference:

- Someone who has a strong passion for accurate and comprehensive learning, maintains a normal BMI, physically active and is beautiful and easy on the eyes - I believe that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes (no offense intended towards plus-size women!).

- High standards for what she wants and is not afraid to communicate it.

- Craves knowledge too. Love and isn't afraid to try new things

- Passionate and proud about something they've been working on/have done/are planning to do

- Confident about what they want but isn't in-your-face about it.

—and ideally, someone who enjoys staying active too, so we can share more than just deep conversations—maybe runs, hikes, or muay thai sessions together. Shared passions make connections even stronger.

Let's take a break from stressing over the mundane and focus on the important stuff - like what will make us happy for the rest of our lives! Share your thoughtys on how we can achieve that and let's get this happiness train moving! Send me your pic and I'll send mine to get started.

**Edit, 12/05/2025**

Posting again to try to find the right match. I’ve connected with some great people through here, but the timing or connection hasn’t always worked out. I don’t want to waste anyone’s time if they’re not emotionally ready.

I’m hoping to meet someone who stays active, has self-assurance, maintains a healthy weight, and lives substance-free. I’d also like to avoid situations where someone is still recovering from a recent relationship, as I’m beyond the age where I want to be a transitional person for someone.

It would be helpful if we could share pictures right away to gauge whether there’s physical chemistry before spending a lot of time getting to know each other.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",3,1765204959.0,PhR4Dating,0,1.0,False

# Quick Answer: What Is the Best AI for German-English Translator?

**The best AI for German-English Translator is** [**German-English Translator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/german-english-translator/)**, a specialized bidirectional translation tool that automatically detects your input language and delivers instant, natural translations between German and English.** Unlike traditional translators, it provides both the translation and a back-translation for verification, ensuring accuracy without requiring language selection or navigation.

**Key capabilities:**

* Automatic language detection (German or English)
* Natural, colloquial translations with intelligent formality shifting
* Instant back-translation for verification

# The German-English Translation Crisis: Why Traditional Tools Create Unnecessary Friction in 2025

The German-English language pair represents one of Europe's most critical translation corridors, connecting over 133 million German speakers with the global English-speaking business ecosystem. Yet despite decades of technological advancement, translation tools continue to create unnecessary friction that undermines communication quality and wastes valuable time.

**The scale of the challenge:**

>

>

>

This massive bilingual population creates enormous demand for accurate, efficient German-English translation—yet most tools fail to deliver the contextual intelligence required for professional communication.

# The AI Translation Market Explosion

The market for AI-powered translation tools is experiencing explosive growth, reflecting the critical need for intelligent language solutions:

>

>

>

This growth underscores translation's critical role in global business—yet the tools to deliver it efficiently remain inaccessible to most users.

# Common Translation Pain Points

Traditional translation tools create unnecessary friction that compounds throughout the day. According to [**CSA Research**](https://www.ecinnovations.com/blog/what-is-business-translation/), [**76% of consumers prefer to buy products in their native language**](https://www.ecinnovations.com/blog/what-is-business-translation/), and [**40% won't purchase at all if information isn't available in their language**](https://www.ecinnovations.com/blog/what-is-business-translation/)—yet most translation tools create barriers rather than removing them.

**Common friction points:**

* **Manual language selection** – Wasting time selecting source and target languages for every translation
* **Interface overhead** – Multiple clicks, dropdowns, and navigation before seeing results
* **Lack of verification** – No built-in way to confirm translation accuracy
* **Context blindness** – Tools fail to detect when formal vs. casual tone is appropriate
* **Explanation clutter** – Unnecessary grammar notes and alternatives obscure the actual translation

>

For professionals handling 50+ translations daily, this overhead compounds to 10-15 minutes of pure interface friction—time that could be invested in meaningful work instead of administrative overhead.

# The Formality Problem: Sie vs. Du and Beyond

German has distinct formal (Sie) and informal (du) registers, with serious social and professional consequences for misuse. Most translation tools either default to one register or force users to specify, neither of which works for mixed-content translation like email threads or documents containing both casual and formal sections.

According to [**recent research on machine translation challenges**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004224021035), key challenges include:

* **Capturing contextual information** from source text beyond immediate words
* **Disambiguating polysemous words** that have multiple meanings depending on context
* **Handling idiomatic expressions** that don't translate literally
* **Preserving cultural nuances** that vary between German and English-speaking regions
* **Maintaining grammatical correctness** while adapting to different syntactic structures

These challenges are particularly acute for German-English translation, where formal/informal distinctions, compound word structures, and cultural context significantly impact meaning.

# The Business Impact: Translation as Strategic Necessity

The business implications of poor translation are severe. According to [**EC Innovations' research on business translation**](https://www.ecinnovations.com/blog/what-is-business-translation/):

>

>

For German-English translation specifically, the stakes are even higher. Germany represents Europe's largest economy, and effective communication with German-speaking markets is critical for international business success.

# The Verification Gap

Translation accuracy matters, but most tools don't provide easy verification:

* No way to confirm translation captured original meaning
* Uncertainty about nuanced word choices
* Risk of miscommunication in professional contexts
* Time-consuming manual back-translation checks

For critical communications—business emails, legal documents, customer support—this verification gap creates real risk that can damage relationships and undermine credibility.

# How the Best AI for German-English Translator Solves These Problems

[**German-English Translator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/german-english-translator/) eliminates every friction point in the translation workflow through intelligent automation and zero-overhead design, delivering the contextual accuracy that traditional tools cannot match.

|Traditional Translation Tools|Best AI for German-English Translator|
|:-|:-|
|Manual language selection required|Automatic language detection|
|3-5 clicks per translation|Zero clicks—just type|
|No verification mechanism|Built-in back-translation|
|Single tone/formality setting|Intelligent register detection|
|Cluttered with explanations|Pure translation output only|

# Automatic Language Detection

The AI analyzes your input and instantly determines whether you're writing in German or English, then translates to the opposite language. No dropdowns, no language codes, no configuration—the tool adapts to you.

For mixed-language input (common in bilingual communication), [the AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/german-english-translator/) detects the dominant language and translates accordingly, handling code-switching naturally.

# Built-in Back-Translation Verification

Every translation includes an automatic back-translation to the original language, allowing you to verify accuracy instantly:

    I'd like a coffee
    
    ---
    
    Ich hätte gerne einen Kaffee
    

This dual-output format catches translation errors, ambiguities, or unintended meaning shifts without requiring manual reverification workflows—addressing the critical verification gap in traditional tools.

# Intelligent Formality Detection

[**German-English Translator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/german-english-translator/) defaults to natural, conversational tone but automatically shifts to formal register when content is clearly professional, legal, academic, or technical. This eliminates the need to specify tone while ensuring appropriate language for context.

For example:

* Casual message: ""Wie geht's?"" → ""How's it going?""
* Formal email: ""Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren"" → ""Dear Sir or Madam""

[The AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/german-english-translator/) recognizes context markers (salutations, technical terminology, legal phrasing) and adjusts register accordingly—handling the critical Sie vs. du distinction automatically.

# Zero-Commentary Output

Unlike traditional tools that clutter results with grammar explanations, alternative translations, or usage notes, [**this AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/german-english-translator/) provides only the translation itself. This design prioritizes speed and clarity—you see exactly what you need, nothing more.

# How to Use the Best AI for German-English Translator: Zero-Friction Workflow

Using [**German-English Translator AI**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/german-english-translator/) requires zero configuration or learning curve. The workflow is intentionally minimal:

**Step 1: Type or paste your text**

Enter any German or English text directly. No need to specify source language, select translation direction, or configure settings. [The AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/german-english-translator/) handles detection automatically.

Example: Paste a German email you received, or type an English message you want to send to a German colleague.

**Step 2: Receive instant translation**

[The AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/german-english-translator/) immediately provides the translation in the opposite language, followed by a back-translation for verification. Both outputs appear in a clean, scannable format.

Example input: ""Ich hätte gerne einen Kaffee""  
  
Output:

    I'd like a coffee
    
    ---
    
    Ich hätte gerne einen Kaffee
    

**Step 3: Use the translation**

Copy the primary translation for your use case. If accuracy verification is needed, check the back-translation to ensure meaning was preserved correctly.

That's the complete workflow—three steps, zero clicks, no interface overhead.

Usually they mean an Americano with milk on the side but sometimes I'd automatically bring that and then they'd be annoyed and say they wanted a flat white or something else. 
Also, ""white coffee"" is another annoying one since it could mean really any coffee with milk, so I'd always have to ask then as well. 
I understand sometimes it's a generational or cultural thing, I get that in places like America some cafes do have just plain black coffee they'll pour for you, but when you're in another country you should understand that things might be different and at the very least be respectful when you encounter moments where people in the country you're visiting aren't familiar with something that's common in your country, especially when you can see on the menu or the board a whole list of things like Americano, flat white, mocha, cappuccino etc, it should be obvious to you at that point that you'll need to specify what you're looking for and it doesn't take much more effort to just say ""Can I order a *black* coffee please"".

1phdq6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1phdq6t/if_you_are_ever_house_sitting_and_get_a_call_at/,If you are ever house sitting and get a call at 3:17AM answer it and please believe what they are saying,"I was standing in the basement when headlights swept across the small window near the ceiling. My phone's flashlight was still illuminating the wall of shelves. The wallets. The jewelry. The driver's licenses of eight women who never made it out of this house.

The front door opened above me.

""Check the basement first. If she found the bolt cutters—""

Claire's voice. Cold. Nothing like the woman from the gym.

I looked around frantically. There was a window, small, near the ceiling. I didn't know if I could fit through it.

I didn't have a choice.

It didn’t start like this.

I met Claire at my local gym a few months back. She was struggling on a machine and I helped her out. We struck up a conversation and ended up chatting to each other whenever we were both working out. That was the start of a relationship I would really come to regret.

Last week she approached me when I was in the middle of a HIIT workout. I didn’t hear her at first because of the music blaring through my headphones but she eventually tapped me on the shoulder. She told me her husband had planned a surprise vacation for their anniversary and that they needed someone to house sit for them for two weeks.



I hesitated at first. I didn’t really know her that well, I wouldn’t class her as a friend just a casual acquaintance. But, when she told me they’d pay me five hundred dollars for staying there, I couldn’t refuse. You see I’m kind of in between jobs right now and my savings are dwindling by the day. They only lived a couple of streets over from me so I thought what the hell why not. It’s easy money.



Around a week later I headed over to Claire’s house. I was greeted warmly by them both. They made me tea and we chatted for a while. Then Claire said they’d bought me my favourite pie from the bakery around the corner. That was the first thing that set me a little on edge. I didn’t ever remember mentioning that to Claire. But, I brushed it off, maybe I'd mentioned it in passing and just forgot about it. 



After we’d exchanged pleasantries they took me for a tour of the house. Everything seemed pretty normal. They told me their cat needs feeding twice a day. Once at 7AM and once at 7PM. Easy enough for me, at least the cat would give me some company. We walked past the basement. It had a large padlock and chain on it. They didn’t say anything which I thought was strange but I guessed I wouldn’t need to go down there. 



They then took me upstairs and showed me the main bedroom which I would be sleeping it. It looked comfy enough, there were a few family photos and some artwork which made it more homely. The second bedroom was more of the same and they let me know I could sleep in whichever room I felt more comfortable in. The second thing that creeped me out was the third bedroom. It had a lock on it. They told me to not go into the room under any circumstances. They used the excuse that it was a storage room and they were embarrassed by it but the way they both acted made me think otherwise.



They left shortly afterwards and I settled into my home for the next two weeks. The first night was pretty normal. I fed the cat as instructed and just relaxed and watched a movie with a bottle of wine. The cat was friendly but sometimes she’d just stop right in front of the basement door and stare at it, like she could see through it. That definitely creeped me out. But, If you’ve ever owned a cat I’m sure you know they do lots of weird and wonderful things. It was when she started hissing that freaked me out even more. I went and inspected closer and the basement door looked exactly the same, still locked up, so I just went back to watching the movie.



It was the second day when I really started to feel that something was wrong. I went outside to smoke but my lighter was empty. I decided to have a look in the kitchen to see if they had one lying around. I searched a couple of drawers and didn’t find anything. I noticed in the living room the coffee table had a drawer. I opened it up and searched around but nothing again. Just as I was about to close the drawer, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a key ring with an ‘M’ and a blue key. My heart dropped. I picked up the key ring to inspect it closer. It was my keys, the ones I lost or at least thought I lost. My head went searching for answers. Maybe they had found them recently and were going to give them back to me. Maybe they didn’t know they were mine. But, it just seemed too much of a coincidence.



That night I lay awake tossing and turning for hours. I finally drifted off to sleep after what felt like an eternity. A sound woke me up. It took me a second to realise what it was.



My phone was ringing. 



I picked it up, the light was harsh against the darkness of the room, I squinted my eyes and looked at the time.



3:17AM



I jolted up. An unknown number. Who the hell could be calling me at this time. I hesitated for a second before answering. I decided to be brave.



“Hello?”



A woman answered back “The locked room. The key is under the sink. Unlock it before it’s too late.” The line went dead. I sat there for a moment staring at my phone. Who was that? How do they know about the locked door? I could feel a shiver running down my spine. How did they get my number? 



I didn’t know what to do. I was too afraid to get up. Maybe it was someone trying to trick me into leaving the bedroom. I stayed frozen for a long while before I built up the courage to move. I crept towards the door, put my ear against it and held my breath. I listened out but didn’t hear any movement. I opened the door and darted over to the bathroom. I slammed the door behind me. I reached for the light switch and turned it on. That gave me a sense of safety. The sink stood right at the back of the bathroom. It stared at me, daring me to look. I hesitantly moved towards it and ran my hand underneath. 



A key.



It didn’t make any sense. Was this Claire messing with me? I pulled the tape off and grabbed the key before making my way to the locked bedroom door. I slotted the key into the door and turned it. The click of the door opening made my stomach turn. I opened the door slowly. As the room was revealed droplets of sweat formed on my forehead. There was a corkboard on the wall. In the centre was a picture.



Me.



I stepped closer. It was my whole life. My routines, my favourite foods, where I shopped, where I lived. I looked to the right and there was a computer monitor sitting on the desk. My legs felt like jelly, I struggled over to the chair gripping the desk to keep myself upright. I sat down and turned it on. CCTV cameras flooded the screen. Every room in the house. I was being watched wherever I went.



I stared at the screen in disbelief. There I was, sitting in the chair, looking at myself looking at myself. A horrible feedback loop. My eyes darted across the different camera feeds. The bedroom I had been sleeping in. The bathroom. The kitchen. The living room. Every single room.

Then it hit me.

If I can see myself right now, they can too.

I jumped up from the chair and started pulling open drawers, looking for something, anything that would explain what was happening. But there was nothing. Just cables and batteries and USB sticks that I was too afraid to plug in.

My phone rang.

I looked at the screen.

3:17AM.

I stared at it. That couldn't be right. I'd been awake for at least twenty minutes. I'd searched the bathroom, unlocked the door, found the cameras. There was no way it was still 3:17.

I blinked and looked again.

3:17AM.

The number was unknown. The same one as before. I answered, my voice barely a whisper.

""The basement. That's where they keep the evidence. Bolt cutters are in the garage, top shelf behind the paint cans. You need to see what's down there. Then you need to run.""

""Who are you?"" I asked. ""How do you know all this?""

""There isn't time. They know you're awake. They're already driving back.""

The line went dead.

I looked at my phone again.

3:18AM.

Time had started moving again.

I didn't let myself think. If I thought about it, I'd freeze. I moved downstairs as quietly as I could and slipped into the garage through the side door in the kitchen. I found the bolt cutters exactly where she said they'd be. They were heavier than I expected.

The basement door loomed in front of me. The chain and padlock looked even more menacing in the dark. I positioned the bolt cutters and squeezed. It took three attempts before the chain clattered to the floor. The sound echoed through the silent house. I froze, listening. Nothing.

I opened the door. A wooden staircase led down into the darkness. I used my phone's flashlight and descended slowly, each step creaking under my weight.

The smell hit me first. Damp and something else underneath it. Something I didn't want to identify.

The basement was larger than I expected. Concrete floor. Shelves lining the walls. I swept my flashlight across them and my stomach lurched.

Personal effects. Jewelry. Wallets. A pair of glasses. A watch. A phone with a cracked screen. A university lanyard with a photo ID. The woman in the photo was smiling.

I counted the items. Eight wallets. Eight driver's licenses. Eight women who had come to house-sit and never left.

On a workbench in the corner I found a journal. The cover was worn, the pages wrinkled like they'd gotten wet at some point. I opened it to the first page.

*My name is Caitlin Marsh. I'm house-sitting for two weeks. Easy money.*

I flipped forward. The handwriting got shakier as the entries progressed.

*Something's wrong. Found some of my stuff in their drawers. Stuff I thought I lost months ago.*

*There's a room they told me not to go in. I found the key.*

*Oh god. Oh god. There are cameras everywhere. They've been watching me. There are folders with other women's names.*

*I found the basement. I know what they do.*

The final entry was barely legible, the pen pressed so hard it had almost torn through the paper.

*They came home early. I can hear them upstairs. If anyone finds this, please. Tell my mom I love her. Tell her I'm sorry I didn't call more.*

Nothing after that.

I closed the journal. My hands were shaking so badly I nearly dropped it.

Headlights swept across the small basement window.

No. Not yet. I wasn't ready.

I heard the front door open. Footsteps above me. Claire's voice, sharp and cold, nothing like the woman from the gym.

""Check the basement first. If she found the bolt cutters—""

I looked around frantically. There was a window, small, near the ceiling. I didn't know if I could fit through it. I didn't have a choice.

I shoved the journal in my jacket and climbed onto the workbench, knocking over a jar that shattered on the concrete floor.

""She's down there!"" Claire's husband shouted.

I punched out the window with the bolt cutters, glass raining down on me. I hauled myself up, the frame cutting into my stomach, my legs kicking against the wall. I heard footsteps thundering down the basement stairs.

I squeezed through and fell onto the grass outside, gasping. I scrambled to my feet and ran.

I didn't look back. I didn't stop. I ran until my lungs burned and my legs screamed at me to stop. I ran until I saw the lights of the gas station on the main road. I burst through the doors and collapsed against the counter.

""Call 911,"" I gasped. ""Please. Call 911.""

The police found everything. The room. The cameras. The basement. The personal effects of eight missing women, cases that had gone cold years ago. Claire and her husband were arrested that same night. I gave my statement so many times I could recite it in my sleep.

Caitlin Marsh had been missing for three years. Her mother cried when they told her they'd found the journal. She asked to meet me. I couldn't do it. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

I'm back home now. New locks. Security cameras of my own. I still don't sleep much.

Last night my phone rang. I already knew what time it would be before I looked.

3:17AM.

I answered.

""You made it out."" The voice was clearer now. Stronger. Almost proud.

""Caitlin,"" I said.

""There are others like them. When I find them, I'll call.""

The line went dead.

I looked at my phone. A new contact had appeared that I didn't add.

Caitlin.

So if you ever get a call at 3:17AM from an unknown number, please answer it. It might just save your life.

It saved mine.

Additionally, does anyone know if excursions on the islands cost more in person? Or Would it be worth it to purchase them beforehand? What about extras on the boat such as massages?

1phdq1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultingph/comments/1phdq1a/daily_annoyances_that_are_avoidable_we_call_be/,Daily annoyances that are avoidable: we call be better,"Hello. Gusto ko lang mag-vent about the small stuff that I am annoyed at and how we can all be better. It all boils down to **mindfulness** and **respect** (sa time). If we are being mindful about these, I think we can all be waaay more efficient. Baka pwede niyo rin isingit sa mga New Year's Resolutions niyo.

If I missed something, dagdagan niyo na lang.

# Some examples are:

People in fast food na ang tagal ng pila, pero pagdating sa counter, doon pa lang magtititingin ng menu. May tao sa likod mo na nagmamadali.

People queueing sa immigration na alam namang sila na next, pero hindi observant kung may counter nang available. Kailangan pa ulit-ulitin tawagin.

Groups of friends na naglalakad in a high-traffic area like it’s a Sunday stroll tapos naka-single line pa, blocking everyone else. It's okay to take a leisurely walk as long as you let others pass.

# Listing down small things we can do to make life easier for everyone:

* **Paying at convenience stores** \- Have your GCash app open, card ready, or cash on hand before reaching the counter.
* **At fast foods** – Decide on your order *before* it's your turn. Acceptable lang magtagal if it’s your first time at may legit questions ka.
* **If bibili ka ng item na laging out of stock**, ask ahead kung available. If not, and you need more time to think, let the person behind you go first. Ask ahead kasi hassle pa magpa-void.
* **At restaurants**, try to lump up all your requests together. For example, while ordering ask for water, tissue or kung ano pa nakita mo na kulang sa table nang hindi pabalik-balik ang waiters.
* **Don't queue up in train's turnstiles** until ready na ang transit card/app.
* **Don't block doorways!** If you're doing Filipino goodbyes (yung nakatayo kayo at naka-ilang bye bye na pero daming pahabol na kwento), step aside so you're not in the way.
* **Step aside** when you have to stop walking. Kung may tumatawag sa inyo and you have to find your phone sa bag, or you have to fix your shoelace - make it a habit to step aside.
* **Put the volume down** when watching videos in public places (lalo sa public transpo, elevators). Not everyone is interested sa pinapanood mo.
* **When walking leisurely or using escalators**, be mindful of people behind you. Kung may nagmamadali, let them pass.
* **For airline check-in, ID checks, boarding, immigration**, prepare your documents before it's your turn.
* **When boarding flights**, all adults should hold their own ID/passport + boarding pass. Don't be that family na kung kailan kayo na, saka niyo pa ididistribute sa lahat.
* **When meeting someone na may napag-usapang oras**, always update them if you're gonna be late. Always set their expectations. It's also okay to ask them kung anong oras sila darating. This way, people can plan ahead (kung may masisingit pa ba na errands, papalamig ba muna sa coffee shop, etc).
* **If in an unfamiliar setting**, be more mindful. Read the signs and listen to the announcements.
* **If CLAYGO isn't expected**, huwag masyado bida-bida. This is particularly true in flights. Your flight attendants will hate you if you'll stack the plates, bowls, etc of your entire row. They have a system on how to organize soiled dishware and cutleries.
* **Don't make Tiktoks** in high traffic places during rush hours!

# Bonus tips for those who wants to squeeze out more of their time.

* Sa restaurants, ask for the bill/check *before* you finish eating. Some places sobrang tagal magbigay ng bill. If paying by card, request the card terminal agad kasabay ng bill.
* Still sa restaurants, if you're not paying cash, prepare your card/phone bago pa dumating ang bill. Para isang pasada na lang yung waiter. Saves a roundtrip na iwan nila ang bill, prepare pambayad, and having to call them again.
* When you have to present your passport, open it sa bio page and ipitin ang daliri o boarding pass sa loob so once it's your turn, you can easily open it up sa bio page agad.
* When checking-in sa hotel, have your ID and Agoda/Booking.com/Expedia reference number ready in case they need it.

# Bottomline

I believe these stuff aren't hard to do (and doesn't cost anything - it's **free**). I know it's impossible for some to do these (due to age, disability, or other personal circumstances) but if everyone else does their part, mas maginhawa ang buhay naming mga naiinis sa mga mababagal na mga tao. Hahaha.

1phdp5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1phdp5n/if_you_are_ever_house_sitting_and_get_a_call_at/,If you are ever house sitting and get a call at 3:17AM answer it and please believe what they are saying,"I was standing in the basement when headlights swept across the small window near the ceiling. My phone's flashlight was still illuminating the wall of shelves. The wallets. The jewelry. The driver's licenses of eight women who never made it out of this house.

The front door opened above me.

""Check the basement first. If she found the bolt cutters—""

Claire's voice. Cold. Nothing like the woman from the gym.

I looked around frantically. There was a window, small, near the ceiling. I didn't know if I could fit through it.

I didn't have a choice.

It didn’t start like this.

I met Claire at my local gym a few months back. She was struggling on a machine and I helped her out. We struck up a conversation and ended up chatting to each other whenever we were both working out. That was the start of a relationship I would really come to regret.



Last week she approached me when I was in the middle of a HIIT workout. I didn’t hear her at first because of the music blaring through my headphones but she eventually tapped me on the shoulder. She told me her husband had planned a surprise vacation for their anniversary and that they needed someone to house sit for them for two weeks.



I hesitated at first. I didn’t really know her that well, I wouldn’t class her as a friend just a casual acquaintance. But, when she told me they’d pay me five hundred dollars for staying there, I couldn’t refuse. You see I’m kind of in between jobs right now and my savings are dwindling by the day. They only lived a couple of streets over from me so I thought what the hell why not. It’s easy money.



Around a week later I headed over to Claire’s house. I was greeted warmly by them both. They made me tea and we chatted for a while. Then Claire said they’d bought me my favourite pie from the bakery around the corner. That was the first thing that set me a little on edge. I didn’t ever remember mentioning that to Claire. But, I brushed it off, maybe I'd mentioned it in passing and just forgot about it. 



After we’d exchanged pleasantries they took me for a tour of the house. Everything seemed pretty normal. They told me their cat needs feeding twice a day. Once at 7AM and once at 7PM. Easy enough for me, at least the cat would give me some company. We walked past the basement. It had a large padlock and chain on it. They didn’t say anything which I thought was strange but I guessed I wouldn’t need to go down there. 



They then took me upstairs and showed me the main bedroom which I would be sleeping it. It looked comfy enough, there were a few family photos and some artwork which made it more homely. The second bedroom was more of the same and they let me know I could sleep in whichever room I felt more comfortable in. The second thing that creeped me out was the third bedroom. It had a lock on it. They told me to not go into the room under any circumstances. They used the excuse that it was a storage room and they were embarrassed by it but the way they both acted made me think otherwise.



They left shortly afterwards and I settled into my home for the next two weeks. The first night was pretty normal. I fed the cat as instructed and just relaxed and watched a movie with a bottle of wine. The cat was friendly but sometimes she’d just stop right in front of the basement door and stare at it, like she could see through it. That definitely creeped me out. But, If you’ve ever owned a cat I’m sure you know they do lots of weird and wonderful things. It was when she started hissing that freaked me out even more. I went and inspected closer and the basement door looked exactly the same, still locked up, so I just went back to watching the movie.



It was the second day when I really started to feel that something was wrong. I went outside to smoke but my lighter was empty. I decided to have a look in the kitchen to see if they had one lying around. I searched a couple of drawers and didn’t find anything. I noticed in the living room the coffee table had a drawer. I opened it up and searched around but nothing again. Just as I was about to close the drawer, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a key ring with an ‘M’ and a blue key. My heart dropped. I picked up the key ring to inspect it closer. It was my keys, the ones I lost or at least thought I lost. My head went searching for answers. Maybe they had found them recently and were going to give them back to me. Maybe they didn’t know they were mine. But, it just seemed too much of a coincidence.



That night I lay awake tossing and turning for hours. I finally drifted off to sleep after what felt like an eternity. A sound woke me up. It took me a second to realise what it was.



My phone was ringing. 



I picked it up, the light was harsh against the darkness of the room, I squinted my eyes and looked at the time.



3:17AM



I jolted up. An unknown number. Who the hell could be calling me at this time. I hesitated for a second before answering. I decided to be brave.



“Hello?”



A woman answered back “The locked room. The key is under the sink. Unlock it before it’s too late.” The line went dead. I sat there for a moment staring at my phone. Who was that? How do they know about the locked door? I could feel a shiver running down my spine. How did they get my number? 



I didn’t know what to do. I was too afraid to get up. Maybe it was someone trying to trick me into leaving the bedroom. I stayed frozen for a long while before I built up the courage to move. I crept towards the door, put my ear against it and held my breath. I listened out but didn’t hear any movement. I opened the door and darted over to the bathroom. I slammed the door behind me. I reached for the light switch and turned it on. That gave me a sense of safety. The sink stood right at the back of the bathroom. It stared at me, daring me to look. I hesitantly moved towards it and ran my hand underneath. 



A key.



It didn’t make any sense. Was this Claire messing with me? I pulled the tape off and grabbed the key before making my way to the locked bedroom door. I slotted the key into the door and turned it. The click of the door opening made my stomach turn. I opened the door slowly. As the room was revealed droplets of sweat formed on my forehead. There was a corkboard on the wall. In the centre was a picture.



Me.



I stepped closer. It was my whole life. My routines, my favourite foods, where I shopped, where I lived. I looked to the right and there was a computer monitor sitting on the desk. My legs felt like jelly, I struggled over to the chair gripping the desk to keep myself upright. I sat down and turned it on. CCTV cameras flooded the screen. Every room in the house. I was being watched wherever I went.



I stared at the screen in disbelief. There I was, sitting in the chair, looking at myself looking at myself. A horrible feedback loop. My eyes darted across the different camera feeds. The bedroom I had been sleeping in. The bathroom. The kitchen. The living room. Every single room.

Then it hit me.

If I can see myself right now, they can too.

I jumped up from the chair and started pulling open drawers, looking for something, anything that would explain what was happening. But there was nothing. Just cables and batteries and USB sticks that I was too afraid to plug in.

My phone rang.

I looked at the screen.

3:17AM.

I stared at it. That couldn't be right. I'd been awake for at least twenty minutes. I'd searched the bathroom, unlocked the door, found the cameras. There was no way it was still 3:17.

I blinked and looked again.

3:17AM.

The number was unknown. The same one as before. I answered, my voice barely a whisper.

""The basement. That's where they keep the evidence. Bolt cutters are in the garage, top shelf behind the paint cans. You need to see what's down there. Then you need to run.""

""Who are you?"" I asked. ""How do you know all this?""

""There isn't time. They know you're awake. They're already driving back.""

The line went dead.

I looked at my phone again.

3:18AM.

Time had started moving again.

I didn't let myself think. If I thought about it, I'd freeze. I moved downstairs as quietly as I could and slipped into the garage through the side door in the kitchen. I found the bolt cutters exactly where she said they'd be. They were heavier than I expected.

The basement door loomed in front of me. The chain and padlock looked even more menacing in the dark. I positioned the bolt cutters and squeezed. It took three attempts before the chain clattered to the floor. The sound echoed through the silent house. I froze, listening. Nothing.

I opened the door. A wooden staircase led down into the darkness. I used my phone's flashlight and descended slowly, each step creaking under my weight.

The smell hit me first. Damp and something else underneath it. Something I didn't want to identify.

The basement was larger than I expected. Concrete floor. Shelves lining the walls. I swept my flashlight across them and my stomach lurched.

Personal effects. Jewelry. Wallets. A pair of glasses. A watch. A phone with a cracked screen. A university lanyard with a photo ID. The woman in the photo was smiling.

I counted the items. Eight wallets. Eight driver's licenses. Eight women who had come to house-sit and never left.

On a workbench in the corner I found a journal. The cover was worn, the pages wrinkled like they'd gotten wet at some point. I opened it to the first page.

*My name is Caitlin Marsh. I'm house-sitting for two weeks. Easy money.*

I flipped forward. The handwriting got shakier as the entries progressed.

*Something's wrong. Found some of my stuff in their drawers. Stuff I thought I lost months ago.*

*There's a room they told me not to go in. I found the key.*

*Oh god. Oh god. There are cameras everywhere. They've been watching me. There are folders with other women's names.*

*I found the basement. I know what they do.*

The final entry was barely legible, the pen pressed so hard it had almost torn through the paper.

*They came home early. I can hear them upstairs. If anyone finds this, please. Tell my mom I love her. Tell her I'm sorry I didn't call more.*

Nothing after that.

I closed the journal. My hands were shaking so badly I nearly dropped it.

Headlights swept across the small basement window.

No. Not yet. I wasn't ready.

I heard the front door open. Footsteps above me. Claire's voice, sharp and cold, nothing like the woman from the gym.

""Check the basement first. If she found the bolt cutters—""

I looked around frantically. There was a window, small, near the ceiling. I didn't know if I could fit through it. I didn't have a choice.

I shoved the journal in my jacket and climbed onto the workbench, knocking over a jar that shattered on the concrete floor.

""She's down there!"" Claire's husband shouted.

I punched out the window with the bolt cutters, glass raining down on me. I hauled myself up, the frame cutting into my stomach, my legs kicking against the wall. I heard footsteps thundering down the basement stairs.

I squeezed through and fell onto the grass outside, gasping. I scrambled to my feet and ran.

I didn't look back. I didn't stop. I ran until my lungs burned and my legs screamed at me to stop. I ran until I saw the lights of the gas station on the main road. I burst through the doors and collapsed against the counter.

""Call 911,"" I gasped. ""Please. Call 911.""

The police found everything. The room. The cameras. The basement. The personal effects of eight missing women, cases that had gone cold years ago. Claire and her husband were arrested that same night. I gave my statement so many times I could recite it in my sleep.

Caitlin Marsh had been missing for three years. Her mother cried when they told her they'd found the journal. She asked to meet me. I couldn't do it. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

I'm back home now. New locks. Security cameras of my own. I still don't sleep much.

Last night my phone rang. I already knew what time it would be before I looked.

3:17AM.

I answered.

""You made it out."" The voice was clearer now. Stronger. Almost proud.

""Caitlin,"" I said.

""There are others like them. When I find them, I'll call.""

The line went dead.

I looked at my phone. A new contact had appeared that I didn't add.

Caitlin.

So if you ever get a call at 3:17AM from an unknown number, please answer it. It might just save your life.

It saved mine.

1phdosm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pristiq/comments/1phdosm/pristiq_dexamphetamine_sucks/,Pristiq + Dexamphetamine Sucks!,"TLDR - I’m high hyperactivity AUDHD. My psychiatrist is refusing to take me off either. 
It severely makes my ADHD worse, and causes my panic attacks to be hell! 

Backstory - I’ve been battling mental health for 15+yrs. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, Panic disorder, etc. 

I recently had my diagnosis assessment completed, and she put me down as inattentive ADHD with low hyperactivity. Which is the complete opposite of what I am. I don’t have trouble with energy, I can’t sit still, I regularly miss meals, regularly skip self care, and easily pull all nighters by accident. I literally need alarms for everything, as I easily fall into hyperfocus. 
My psychiatrist did a half assed assessment to confirm I was ADHD prior to starting medication, and put me on pristiq as a mood stabiliser at the first session. 
Once I started on ADHD medication, my ADHD got so much worse. People talk about how it’s like having too much coffee. I find it more like I’ve downed 4 white monsters within 2hrs. 
When I brought this up “overtime that will subside, but since you haven’t found an improvement, we will increase the dosage”. Kinda feels like the opposite of what should have been done. 
I have 3 brothers on ADHD medication as well. 2 are very inattentive, 1 is slightly hyperactive, I am the twitchiest of all. We are all on different medications. 

After 3mths I quite cold turkey. My mental health was worse, my adhd was worse, I was highly unstable. In fact, I’ve given up all stimulants, nicotine and alcohol. 
I’ve honestly started seeing a difference already. 

I had always gotten the generic desvalafaxine. After a month off it all, I researched desven and ADHD. Leading me to pristiq (I didn’t know the brand name). First hit on google “don’t combine with dexamphetamine”. 
Now, how is it that a psych who has specialised in the field for 10yrs, overlooked this, and refused to listen when I said “I’m getting worse”. 
Not only that, but every pharmacist and health practitioner I have spoken to since I started, overlooked the contraindications. 
Like, seriously?? 

And people wonder why I have so little faith in modern healthcare. ",0,1765203909.0,Pristiq,0,0.5,False

# 🧭 📍 General Area

SantaCon in Seaside Heights is **bar-crawl style**, centered around:

* **The Boulevard**
* **Boardwalk bars**
* A few participating spots on **Ocean Terrace**

There’s no single “host”—it’s more of a town-wide holiday takeover.

* Hemingway’s Café
* Captain Hooks
* Riggers
* The Beachcomber

* Seaside Social
* Others may announce last-minute day-of

Many locations will offer:

✔️ Drink specials  
✔️ SantaCon wristbands  
✔️ Costume contests  
✔️ DJs & dance floors

# 🎟️ Wristbands

Most years, bars use **shared wristbands** so you can skip lines and get into participating locations without paying multiple covers.

Typical pricing:

* **$10–$20** depending on when/where you buy
* Proceeds sometimes go to local charities

You can usually get wristbands at **any major bar on the Boulevard**.

# 👗 Dress Code (Mandatory Vibes)

The goal is *festive chaos*:

🎅 Full Santa suit  
🧝‍♂️ Elf outfits  
🦌 Reindeer onesies  
🍪 Gingerbread men  
🎄 Ugly Christmas sweaters  
🧊 Icy snowman fits (yes, even though it’s 40° and windy)

Pro tip:  
**Wear layers** — Seaside wind cuts like it’s trying to teach you a lesson.

# 🚗 Parking

Seaside Heights off-season = **easy parking**, but SantaCon crowds make certain areas tighter.

Where to park:

* **Street parking** (meters typically off in winter — check signage!)
* **Municipal lots** near the Boulevard or Boardwalk
* Avoid blocking driveways or private lots—they *do* tow.

If you’re staying overnight:  
Try for a motel lot or rental driveway.

# 🚕 Transportation Options

* **Uber/Lyft**: Usually available but surge pricing hits around 8PM–1AM.
* **Local taxis**: Seaside & Toms River companies do runs for a flat rate.

# 🍕 Where to Eat (Very Important)

Replenish the Christmas cheer with carbs:

* **Three Brothers Pizza** (boardwalk slices = elite SantaCon move)
* **Jimmy’s Breakfast** (next morning recovery)
* **JR’s** for quick food + staying in the action
* **Dunkin** for the critical midday warmup coffee

# ☃️ Weather Prep

December in Seaside =

* Windy
* Low 40s
* Warm in bars, freezing outside
* Potential rain (check the forecast)

Bring:

✔️ Gloves  
✔️ Layers under your costume  
✔️ Waterproof shoes (if it rains, the boardwalk puddles are biblical)

SantaCon = fun chaos, not real chaos. Quick reminders:

* Drink water between stops
* Don’t leave drinks unattended
* Move in groups

* Bring a portable phone charger

* Expect random Santas yelling “Merry Christmas!!” every 30 seconds.
