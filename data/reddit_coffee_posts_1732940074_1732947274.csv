I went to Blue dragon a food cart at Hillsboro Station on 3rd that didn't trigger me at all. i often have to eat vegan and gluten free foods so I don't get sick and it makes me really excited when I see a place that fits my dietary needs as I am so limited going out to eat. I don't know any place in town that is solely vegan/vegetarian except in Portland. Does anyone have any recommendations of a places in Hillsboro that are vegan with gluten free offerings? This is the first time I have had no repercussions from a vegan place that also serves seitan. I have gone a couple of times now just for coffee and a cookie.,2,1732946934.0,hillsboro,1,1.0,False

1h363se,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1h363se/pumpkin_haul_reviews_part_2/,Pumpkin Haul Reviews  - Part 2,"Hello all! I dedicated myself to trying lots of pumpkin perfumes this fall in search of what I envisioned as the perfect pumpkin perfume. I wanted a pumpkin yankee candle scent. I did not ultimately find it but I smelled a lot of beautiful perfumes, found other ones I loved, and had fun. Here is the start of some of my reviews. I will say I tried a LOT of pumpkin perfumes and I hope to have more posted in the coming weeks. While I do not have the same way with words many reviewers on here do, I hope this can help others in their pumpkin search.

  
Here is part 2 to my extensive pumpkin search.

  
**Astrid**

I bought these on Ajevie.

**Sweet Potato Pie** (*Spiced sweet potato, flaky butter pie crust and a maple marshmallow topping.*) This was another banger. I loved it a lot. It was giving maple marshmallow immediately. I think I got a bit of crust, or sweet potato, in the background - something that made it not overwhelmingly maple marshmallow. The marshmallow separates it from Kheimistrii's Maple Chai. Also there's no chai. Once I dumped most of the vial on me I got more longevity and throw. Doing little cover-the-top-with-my-thumb-and-apply was okay but didn't get me lots of longevity and it is less than I would apply normally. It wasn't overpowering and I got whiffs of it but it wasn't super strong. Again, I wouldn't smell it and go oh yeah sweet potato, but it did make sense when I smelled it knowing it is sweet potato. There was something more grounding there so maybe that was the crust? I enjoyed this one a lot.

  
**Pumpkin Cream Cheese Whoopie Pies** (*Fluffy spiced pumpkin cake and cream cheese filling.*) I am happy to say the spice does NOT mean cinnamon all day! This also isn't really giving pumpkin. It is giving cream cheese and I was surprised at how realistic it smelled like cream cheese in a whoopie pie. I would not smell this and say, oh yeah, pumpkin, but there's some sort of spice adding to the cream cheese that gives it a slight fall vibe. I was really holding out hope for this, and I can't say Astrid's pumpkin notes lived up to my expectations. I'd like to explore this house more, which is hard with the no sample thing, and I liked Sweet Potato Pie enough to explore the house a bit more, but this and Pumpkin Taffy lacked the pumpkin wow factor I wanted.

  
**Pumpkin Taffy** (*Pumpkin spiced taffy.*) It smells like taffy. How? That's incredible. However like I said above the pumpkin doesn't really come through at all. I was disappointed.

  
**Nui Cobalt**

This was an Ajevie sample.

**Baby Pumpkin** (*A scent to inspire sweetness and affection. Homemade maple pumpkin bread with Autumn harvest honey, spiced with nutmeg and clove, drizzled with salted caramel, and dotted with Turkish apricot. Wear when you're in the mood for gentle hugs, earnest compliments, and warm appreciation.*) I was surprised at how much I like this. It reminds me of Kitchen by Solstice Scents but with apricot showing up instead of peach (right? that's what's in Kitchen?) It starts with a bready spiced apricot with maple coming out on the drydown. It's yummy fall. I don't get pumpkin outright either, but I get standing in a kitchen having just taken fall loaf of bread out of the oven, the sun is shining through the windows, it's not a fancy kitchen but it's the nice one I got, and I'm in no rush. It has pretty low throw but good longevity. I can't justify FSing this having Kitchen already, but it would be worth considering.

  
**Possets**

Ajevie samples. You know the drill.

  
**Asmodeus** (*Deepest pumpkin, brightest suave French lavender, and a thrill of cardamom, light skin musk to hold it all together and keep it going for hours.*) This is very similar to **Lovecraft** by Alchemic Muse but heavier on me. I haven't fully sampled this yet but I put on a little and that's my initial impression. I liked it and will wear the sample more.

**Gingerwitch** *(The thought conjures up dark cake gingerbread and almond, deep juvenile musk and heady invitations)*. I immediately FSed this. I love this one so much. I choose FSes usually based on how I react when I put it on, and if I put it on and go 'yes, yep' I FS it. Many perfumes get a 'yes' or a 'yep' but not every one gets a 'yes, yep.' I loved the almond note in this. I just got this during the Possets black friday sale along with another sample set. I had to resist getting Gingerbread Whorehouse because I can't keep trying gingerbread perfumes. There's a limit. I'm glad I found Gingerwitch before I hit my made up limit. It's sexy. Yes, it is. It might be gourmand leaning but the almond and maybe the musk make it perfect to wear out.

  
**Psycho Pumpkin** (This is pumpkin, slathered in spice and encrusted with sugar. This is pumpkin in its glory, thick and deep, tumbling in honey and caramel. Foody and wicked. Sure to drive someone mad!) I sadly think that Posset's honey and or caramel note is not good on me. I will say, on the first day I sampled this I was like ew, what did I buy? Then four days later I still was like, what is this? But nine days later, it was a whole different experience. The honey really came through. I wouldn't smell it and pick out pumpkin, which I am looking for. The honey led with this. It was stickier, a bit sweeter, than Alchemic Muse Pumpkin Honey, and a bit richer with the honey. If I liked honey I would've liked this.

  
**Pumpkin Tied Up And Licked All Over** (*Pumpkin of the most smooth variety, combined with large lashings of buttercrunch, honey, and crystallized honey.*) I think the honey in Possets' perfumes is not my friend. After nine days of rest, it had a cardboard smell quality to it. I've heard Possets really benefits from resting, so I'll revisit this again over time to see what happens.

  
**Lucky #9**

Ordered through Ajevie. I think that's their perfume house?

**Gingerbread Kitties** (*\*\*Munch!\*\* Ginger, nutmeg, vanilla, caramel, cinnamon*). The gingerbread took a few minutes to come out. It's a sweeter take on gingerbread, I'm assuming it's the vanilla or caramel coming through. It's not as gingerbread snap cookie as Krumkake by Alchemic Muse, it's not as deep as Possets. I didn't test it properly for longevity or throw. It was a bit too sweet for me, I want a real snappy gingerbread.

  
**The Little Book Eater**

TAT was pretty quick. I don't remember exactly but I remember it was fast. Everything was packaged securely.

**Velvet Pumpkin** (*Pumpkin, cookie butter, caramel, ginger, rum, clove, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, cardamom*). To be honest, I had high hopes for this house and it didn't totally vibe with my skin chemistry. This one is definitely a fall perfume. I can't pick out any of the notes in particular but it reads as kind of one note on me. I am considering destashing it but I want to give it a chance at some point. It smells like warm nutmeg, it's not bad, but it's not what I thought it would be.

  
**Maple Candy** (*Maple syrup and maple cream*). This is a very sweet maple perfume. I actually really like this one but it is quite sweet. Not cloying but very sweet. It's for sure maple. I love maple.

I got a couple other non fall themed samples I won't review in depth here, but I did also try Matilda Wormwood and Old Books which smelled awful on me. My skin chemistry was not happy with them. Healer Woman was lovely on me. It was similar to Pasithea by Fable and Canon, which I put on and immediately feel calm, and Healer Woman was similar. 

  
**Sugar Me Sweet**

**Pumpkin Pie Paradise -** I am too lazy right now to post the notes. This one was actually closer to what I was looking for but still not quite it. I will also say most of her other perfumes pulled plasticy on me, so I was turned off from that. I'd say this one was the best out of the other non pumpkin samples I got. To her credit, the package got lost in the mail, and she was responsive and willing to resend it, but ultimately the package turned up, so it was all good.

  
**Solstice Scents**

TAT was incredible. I ordered during the fall release and I think she shipped the next day. You choose your own free sample and I chose Wilcox Potting Shed. I haven't properly tested it yet so I won't be reviewing it but I think it will make a great spring perfume.

**Kitchen** (*Pumpkin, Sugar Cookies, Peach Preserves, Spice Breads, Danishes, Caramel, Vanilla & Sweet Wood Smoke*). This one kind of is like a craft store smell aisle, but I love it. I get the peach but it mixes in with everything else and it smells like a kitchen in fall where I wanna be. I don't smell it and go ""pumpkin"" but it's inviting and fall and I love it. I don't get any of the smoke, it is all very well blended. **Baby Pumpkin** by Nui Cobalt has more of a bread note than this but they're similar.

**Pumpkin Spice Latte** \- (*Sweet Pumpkin, Cinnamon, Gingerbread Whipped Cream & A Drop of Nutmeg.*) I got a sample of this in the swaps last year and LOVED this, but it wasn't available when I got it. I ordered three rollerballs of this in the fall release and have already almost gone through one. It's such a good pumpkin note and the coffee isn't sweat or overwhelming. Maybe it's the gingerbread? Wait, coffee isn't even in the notes I'm realizing. What?! All I know is, this is an incredible perfume and it smells so good. The gingerbread and nutmeg give it a heartier vibe than just coffee. The cinnamon is well blended and as someone who amps cinnamon, I don't amp it at all.

  
**Black Hearted Tart**

I got the first sample of the following scent in a swap...I think? Then I ordered two more of the samples from Ajevie over the summer. I was debating getting a FS of this, but having fallen in love with PSL by Solstice Scents I couldn't justify both. The sample I'm referencing is

**Tiger Mountain Peasant** (*Warm pumpkin pie served ala mode with coffee bean ice cream and maple syrup drizzle. Aromatic cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and clove spices were blended with savory pumpkin custard. Bakery notes of butter and vanilla were added for a comforting warmth. Additional notes of espresso and cream make this fragrance a Pumpkin Spice Latte fan favorite.*) This smells like opening up a bag of pumpkin spice coffee and smelling it. It is really realistic to smelling my pumpkin coffee when I open it in the morning. PSL by Solstice Scents has pumpkin and latte but it doesn't make me think of my Dunkin bag in the morning. This does.

  
Arcana Wildcraft

Fast TAT, within a few days. This was an oil sample.

**Pin-Up Pumpkin** (*With notes of creamy pumpkin cheesecake warm from the oven, a graham cracker crust, and a flirty touch of spice*). I had a lot of hope for this one, and I liked it, but couldn't bring myself to FS it. My friend sniffed it and said he didn't get pumpkin but he liked it. I would agree. I retested it again recently and got more graham cracker crust, which was impressive I got that, but it wasn't pumpkin enough for me to FS. I wish it were because it had promise. I had hope.

  
Alright folks. There's still some more I have to review but part 3 will come soon. This is the cumulation of months of sampling pumpkin perfumes and having the time of my life. I had a great time.",1,1732946567.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

She opened up with the idea of doing LDR again for a year but coming in and out every 2 months so we’ll still be seeing each other. I can understand that she’s wants to do this because she wants to be happy but man I didn’t sign up to do LDR again.

My friend and I met 6 years ago and worked in the same field. It was a close friendship. However, we fell out after moving onto something else and spoke on and off. I knew that she was not happy with her current position and she indicated wanting to change her job on more than one occasion (I am working somewhere I studied for and she is not). 
Fast forward to present time, I spoke to my supervisor and we have decided that she could offer my friend a job. Their meeting went great and they seemed to agree on everything, she seemed thankful to me for recommending her. We both were excited to start working together. Only to one day later receive my supervisor's call that my friend refused her offer (AFTER telling me how great the interview went and how excited she was for the job).
Admittedly, I kind of brushed her offer to go for a coffee to celebrate her new beginning off because I was busy with work and I could not decide if I would want to go out this weekend, I felt too tired to decide. I left her on read and I regret it. Now I'm left wondering if I am the reason she refused the offer because I did not reply to her soon enough (because her excuse to my supervisor was otherwise questionable, something about being unable to work 5 days a week straight). 
My main concern is that she refused the job to my supervisor but did not tell me about it even though I was the one to put in the recommendation to her. 
So...I guess am I the asshole who made her feel so uncomfortable that she refused the job offer? 
I feel really bad because I was looking forward to reconnecting and being coworkers. My supervisor is also sad about this loss, although he doesn't see my fault in it.
Any tips on what to do are appreciated, currently I'm planning to agree on a coffee sometime soon so we could talk it out but I'm not sure how to feel about her not telling me about her job refuseal.  Thanks for any input in advance",2,1732946034.0,AmItheAsshole,3,1.0,False

I found out about this sub by accident today and reading through the posts has been a huge help to stay strong despite the struggles I’ve been having so far. 

After a 7 month period of drinking at least 8 British pints of beer per day I have now been sober for 5 full days. The first time my “Sober from Monday” has actually come to fruition since my last sober attempt in February. 

During my drunk period I would sleep anywhere from 10-14 hours per day, every day. I would fall asleep fairly quickly and I could always get back to sleep when I woke up. 

Now I can’t sleep. 

When I try to sleep it feels like I just sank 5 coffees. After what feels like hours of persistence, I experience what I believe to be some form of sleep, only to see a solitary hour has passed. This tends to repeat until I feel slightly rested or I give up and promise to try again later. 

I believe I have averaged around 2-3 hours of sleep per night, with maybe a short nap through the day to stave off the headache. 

Despite this I remain determined to not drink. I’ve been through this before, my ability to sleep will return. I do not need to drink to fix this.

I went to pick up my drink and the drink was warm to the touch. It did have ice in it. I ask the barista why the drink was warm, and he replied it was because the coffee was fresh brewed. I tell him it’s supposed to be made with cold brew, he says it is cold brew, just a fresh batch. It’s like we’re both speaking a different language at this point. He doesn’t understand why cold brew should never be hot and why I wouldn’t want a “fresh brewed” cup. 

I end up talking to another barista and she made my drink correctly. What bothers me is that the male barista still doesn’t understand my mistake and to him I came off as a needy customer. 

I make my own cold brew now and haven’t been back since. I’m definitely saving money and  I’m having fun brewing different kinds of coffee. I’ve never been big into coffee mainly because my stomach issues. It’s become a fun little hobby. ",3,1732945661.0,barista,1,1.0,False

Am I calculating this correctly? Can one shot of cream truly be 100 calories ? It feels so unbelievable.

I was in the kitchen and calmly walked over told my son to be careful next time and started picking up the pieces. My husband has better vision than me so I told him to look closely for small pieces with his great eyes. I went and grabbed the broom and started collecting the tiny pieces and was wondering where my husband went. He had left to the living room and was just browsing on his phone. I couldn’t believe it! I said why did you leave why are you not helping me clean up? He straight up said “you didn’t tell me to and I thought you got it all.” I’m so sick of it.

Backstory, I do have a history of depression and anxiety (medicated since teenage years) and have recently been diagnosed with adhd as well (also now medicated). I work from home so I'm almost always alone during the day. I could go work from somewhere else like a friend's house or coffee shop but I never want to leave the house and only leave when forced to. Every day is a struggle to get work done on my end. I can't afford to hire a manager to run the business for me and I'm constantly being texted and called by employees, have to step in to fix something with a customer, etc, so I NEVER get a break and havent had a real day off in 1.5 years.

Instead, her eyes wandered, landing occasionally on the other patrons, her lips curving into polite smiles when someone caught her gaze.*

*He sat two tables away, his black coffee untouched as he tracked her movements. She looked harmless, ordinary even, but he knew better. The girl was connected to something—or someone—that mattered. The reports were vague, but her name kept surfacing in places it shouldn’t, attached to whispers of information slipping through cracks that needed to be patched up.* 

*He was here to confirm, to observe, to report. Nothing more.*

*Her gestures were ordinary: a stir of her cup, a glance at the door, the way she fidgeted with the edge of her scarf. She moved like someone with nothing to hide, someone whose life could be summed up in routines and small comforts. It was exactly the kind of inconspicuousness that could make someone like her valuable to whatever she was involved in.*

*This was the job—tedious, methodical, and requiring unyielding focus. Surveillance was about patience, after all, and if she turned out to be as insignificant as she appeared, he’d move on to the next target without hesitation. For now, though, she was his problem, so he stayed: watching, waiting, and letting the hours tick by.*

Hi there! Thanks for stopping by. You can call me Suki, and I’m a woman in my late 20s (though am open to writing either character in this M/F pairing).

The short snippet above is part of a story I’m hoping to develop with a partner. It’s a gritty, slow-burn romance set in the world of 1960s, Cold War-era espionage. Please don't come to me expecting historical accuracy. I'm just in it for the *vibes.*

Ideally, I'd like it to begin with the MC’s surveillance of the FC, until eventually he starts to insert himself into her life. It's deceptive and manipulative at its best, so maybe he comes in as a friend, a rescuer, or a possible romantic partner. :)   

I have a lot of different ideas for what direction this might roll in, so feel free to send me a message if you're curious. 

I’m looking for a partner who’s 21+, enjoys detailed writing in third person, past tense, and can respond a few times a week. I tend to write longer posts (usually I break the character limit!) but am flexible about length as long as there’s quality in the story. I only write on Discord. 

If this sounds like your thing, please send me which character you’d prefer to write and any ideas you have! Sorry to say, but I will ignore any low effort messages. Hope to hear from you soon. :)",1,1732944985.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

But I forgot Thanksgiving & Christmas was in my way. The family has big get togethers and the meal prep by the cooks takes days. In an effort to appease my daughter I interrupted my fast for Thanksgiving. I ate one heaping tablespoon of all the foods that were prepared except the deserts which I avoided.

Because I am hoping this is the last time in my life I will have enough fat fuel to do fasts that are significantly longer than 30 days, I believe this is my last chance to see if I can beat my longest fast. I should have just enough fat fuel on me to do it.

==== My routine ====
Wake up and make a 52 oz homemade LMNT  electrolyte beverage. Attempt to drink this over the course of my waking hours. If my brain does not want to drink it all I won’t. In that case I just pitch whatever is left the next morning and make a fresh batch. If I am voraciously drinking it and run out for the day I make another batch. Rare but if I exert room much energy doing something like helping someone move I will drink more of it. NOTE: Google “LMNT recipe” if you want to use what I use.

Drink 1-2 cups of black coffee if I am working.

Drink my LMNT beverage and water for the rest of the day.

Drink herbal lemon tea or decaf green tea if I need something to sate my internal hunger beast that can occasionally show up uninvited. Also use these hot drinks if i start feeling the vomit monster trying to get me.

Drink bone broth if I hit any difficult patches. Have it on hand, hoping not to need any.

Drink a 12 oz can or bottle of sparkling water if the soda monster shows up uninvited.

Take prescription 40mg Omeprazole if my acid reflux flares up.

If I ever feel terrible or my uncontrollable vomiting starts I will end my fast like I always do.

1h35gvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1h35gvb/am_i_the_bad_guy_in_this_advice_needed_desperately/,Am I the bad guy in this (advice needed desperately),"Okay, so my friends and I recently had a falling out because they accused me of not being a good friend, not being there for them, etc. 
this all started over the summer after friend 1 moved out of state. We would FaceTime/call and then I had some shit go down with my parents and kinda fell off in terms of talking to friend 1. We talked about it and I said I would do better about calling and such. Throughout the summer we continued to call and, I’ll admit, I would cancel on them a lot because I was tired or just didn’t feel like talking. 
Later in the summer our group went to visit friend 1 and we had a really great time and me and friend 1 talked and figured things out. Fast forward to the school year, me and friend 2 are in the same town going to different schools. We hangout a decent amount and stay in touch and everything. When we would hangout it would usually be after my late class on Tuesdays and I would go pick friend 2 up, we would drive around and get coffee and listen to music and whatever. 
Well, friend 1 was still not happy with the amount we were calling and mentioned it again and I said sorry and I would do better and I did. I called them during my breaks between classes, would call after I closed at work, would call even when I needed to be doing homework but I promised I would call so I did. Sometimes I would cancel and explain that I REALLY needed to do hw. They would be like yeah that’s fine go grind so I was like okay cool everything is fine they aren’t mad. 
Eventually, friend 2 brought up that friend 1 had been saying that they were still upset about my consistency and that I needed to do better. I was like “we already talked about this but okay I understand. Also, why didn’t they just tell me instead?” And the response was some bullshit like they’re scared of upsetting you. I get that but we’re not children, if we’re friends we need to be open and not scared of hurting feelings over saving a friendship. 
Sometime later friend 2 started bringing up the same problems that friend 1 had with me. Saying that I wasn’t consistent in hanging out, saying that I don’t call enough  (we NEVER called, it wasn’t our thing), and that I needed to do better if we were gonna be friends. Mind you, the only in person confrontation was when friend 2 told me what friend 1 said. 
Fast forward to like two weeks ago, me and friend 1 FaceTimed 4/7 days that week. Friday we FaceTimed and I let them know I would be busy the next two days and that if I don’t respond as much I’m working/doing plans that I had planned. Well on Sunday, friend 1 was supposed to call me and I asked if we were still gonna call and they said something like “honestly I don’t really wanna call tonight anymore, I’m really upset about everything that’s been going on and you not calling me, it really hurts my feelings.” I was like okay I’m sorry I’ll do better I thought I was doing better tho? And they said no I wasn’t doing better and we need to talk about it and reevaluate from here. Friend 2 says a similar thing to me the same day and stops talking to me and eventually completely cuts me off. 
Fast forward to today, me and friend 1 haven’t talked still so I went ahead and said we need to move on, I wish you the best and I love you. I need to staring healing from all of this and hopefully we can reconnect and start over. They left me on opened and did not respond. I just wanna know if I’m really the bad guy and that them unfriending me is valid or if they’re fishing and are being unreasonable. 
Side note: friend 1 moved, I supported what they wanted and. Friend 2 dropped out and moved home, I was supportive and was like do what u need for u and I’m here for you. I just can’t see how I’ve been a “bad friend” other than the inconsistency over the summer. I feel extremely blindsided loosing two friends at the same time and like they are just feeding off of each other and blowing it out of proportion. If anyone has any thoughts and opinions, even if it is against me, pls drop it down here because this has been driving me crazy. Even my parents and all my other friends are saying the grounds they chose are unreasonable and petty and that I shouldn’t even try to salvage it b",1,1732944228.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Some background - I had colon resection earlier this year to remove 18 inches of colon infected with diverticulitis. As part of my full recovery from that for the rest of my life I am to take psyllium husk fiber powder daily, along with a laxative. I usually take them together with a glass of orange juice, since the fiber is already orange flavored. This was usually my pseudo-breakfast, along with some coffee. Happy to say this has been going well. 

Well. After starting my first dose I had the worst stomach cramps and bloating I’ve ever had. I couldn’t pinpoint it to anything specific, but it was bad. So I eliminated the fiber first, thinking that might have been the trigger. 

And yep. That was it. Haven’t had the stomach cramps or bloating since. But not taking the fiber isn’t an option. 

Has anyone else had this? Do I just take the fiber supplement with food instead? 

Any recommendations would be helpful. Thanks! ",2,1732943758.0,Semaglutide,3,1.0,False

1h35b67,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowardUniversity/comments/1h35b67/could_i_get_in/,Could I get in? ,"PLEASE LMK WHAT YALL THINK. 

Im a senior this year, and I am applying early action to Howard. It is my dream school, the only reason I didnt apply early decisions is because my parents didn't want me to. 

As I wait for decisions to come out ive been extremely anxious. If I don't get in I've gotten into a couple of schools including an accelerated molecular bioscience masters program at Seton Hall (Im commiting there if I dont get into Howard). 

My GPA is ABSOLUTE CRAP, its a 86 weighted. Which is around a 3.1 (I do not need to hear crap about my grades I KNOW it is AWFUL). I took almost all honors and AP, Ive taken 5+ Science courses (with labs), and 5 years of math, 4 years of English (all honors/AP), 5 Social Science/History classes, and 3 years of Foreign Language. 

My SAT score is a ... 1270. Again I know this is not a remarkable score by any means whatsoever, but I went through a lot of crap which I highlighted through my essay. I won't share my essay publicly ofc, but those who read it were able to feel the same hurt I went through when I faced issues like my disordered eating, family stress, and the deaths of several people in my family (not COVID related). 

In my optional essays I wrote about how I wanted to major in biology so that I could become a doctor who would take time to research and evaluate the role genetics plays into diseases. So many people in my family died of illnesses that were common in our family, considering the low number of South Asian representation in clinical trials I feared that their deaths could have been due to lack of knowledge on whether or not certain treatments they went through actually were for them or just for white men (the predominent demographic researched). I really put my heart into that essay, because the reason I want to go to Howard needs to be highlighted as it's not just another school I'm applying to, it's where I can see myself achieve my goals to the greatest extent. My other essay was about my experience in marching band, how I saw our whole team come together to tell a story to an audience. I would get frustrated that certian people weren't as skilled as me or I wasn't as skilled as others, but as I leave the band this year I see that each person's unique part in the show is what makes it better than any other.

I am 20M and She's 22F. I'll tell something about me. I've had a 3 year long distance situationship till my college's first year.One time we met after 1.5 yrs, she brought her ex saying they were going a common place and will be staying together in his friend's flat. That broke my heart on the spot but I didn't do anything. This ended badly as she had started affecting my mental health so I had to ghost her in the end. My parents also got to know about her and had warned me 3 times to sever all connections with her saying she's not a good girl. After that in  college I had to short and bad experiences to the point where I stopped looking for any kind of love and just focused on myself. 

Now it was around 10 days ago. I was traveling with my friend to college in an e rickshaw. The rickshaw stopped near a university department from where she entered. Now I was not paying attention and only talking to my friend. I felt like someone is staring at me but I ignored. Then she got off near her hostel and we went to our college. Same day in evening I get a follow request on Instagram. I accepted and I get a message saying - hi , I saw you on e rickshaw today and you were really cuuuute. Then I remembered that okay it's her. We talked a little and I got to know she finds me really cute. How did she find my id- she estimated from the direction I was going to 2-3 University departments and checked all the pages for my as she clearly remembered my face. I was like woww😂.Then we decided to meet after 2-4 days as we both were going home. Her home is in Gurgaon, Haryana, India.

The day we met I had bought a silk chocolate and kept in my bag but when I went to meet her it was left in my bag only🫠. I was talking to my friend ki fuck bag me hi rehgyi and she heard me and said no formalities needed you're here that's enough. I promised I'm bringing that chocolate the next day we meet for sure. Then I booked a cab . Can was late so we talked. Then I opened the door for her and we went to a place my friend had suggested. We ordered coffees and talked. She was a talker and I was a listener. She's also like you too say something na 😂. Then we talked about our shared experiences. In the end I booked a cab to her hostel and dropped her. The date went good according to me.She said let's meet again tomorrow.

Next day I fell ill and had to cancel and said to meet day after . That's when she said she has missed many classes and needs to study (her exams are not till like 20 days) . I said okay. 2 days went by. I messaged her on insta to check on her if everything's good. No reply for 3 days straight. I thought okay I'm ghosted now. Then I contacted her on snapchat to verify if I'm ghosted or not cuz it didn't make sense. Now, she was regularly posting stories on insta- mostly heartbreak, dreaming of having a novel like boyfriend and visits with her friends - but now replying to me.On the snapchat she replied-- I only open insta to post stories and then I log out. Then I said okay and asked when can we meet as my exams are approaching too and we won't have much time afterwards as my college life would be over. 
She said she's not here for few days  and I'm like okay.

Yesterday I sent her a cute flirty reel to which she replied positively. She continues to post heartbreak stories.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/8w6QBTKJF3): **November 19, 2024**

I, (28F) used to be best friends with Anna (28F) since high school. She was popular and outgoing, while I was the introverted ""nerdy"" friend. In high school, I had a crush on Ethan (28M), but I assumed he’d prefer Anna, so I stayed out of it. They started dating, and I supported her with reluctance because of their toxic, on-and-off relationship. Over time, I grew to dislike Ethan because he was rude and mean.

They broke up when we were 21, but got back together with him a year later and eventually got engaged at 23. Three months before the wedding, Ethan drunkenly called me, asking why I rejected him. I dismissed him and said he was drunk and ended the call. The very next day, I was kicked out of group chats and ghosted by everyone else in our friend circle.

When I texted my friends to ask what happened, they gave me the silent treatment. When I reached out to Anna, I found myself blocked. Desperate, I even tried calling Ethan, but my number was blocked too. I had no idea what I’d done wrong and I wished anyone would tell me.

That week was hell. Anna’s silence hurt the most because, at the time, she meant everything to me. I barely slept, battling panic attacks at night while trying to keep it together for class during the day. If not for my supportive roommates who helped me through my panic attacks, I don’t know how I would have made it through.

Anna and I attended the same local university but took different courses. I waited for her outside her class. When she came out with her friends, I pulled her aside and asked what was going on.

She accused me of being a fake friend who tried to steal Ethan. I denied her accusation and asked for proof, but she went silent and left.

They didn’t unfriend me on Facebook, but kept posting about their hangouts and the bridal shower, along with indirect jabs at me. I eventually deleted my old account, and changed my number. I slowly rebuilt my self-esteem and moved on.

I recently created a new Facebook account. A few days ago, I was added to a group chat for our upcoming reunion, which I had no idea about. They greeted me, calling me ""class president"" as if they hadn’t shunned me six years ago. I left the group, but they messaging me. Anna kept calling, so I finally picked up out of annoyance. She told me that she was sorry for everything and wished for me to come to the class reunion party. The party didn't seem to be complete without the class president every year.

She told me that she divorced Ethan after two years of marriage. She tried to reach out to me but couldn’t find any of my socials or contact info after we graduated. I asked her why she was telling me all this when she was not important to me anymore. She cried. I ended the call and continued ignoring their messages on Messenger.

My family says forgiveness is for my own peace and that it doesn’t mean forgetting. But I don’t feel anything anymore, only indifference. I don’t owe them anything to ease their guilt. So, AITA?

p/s: I originally posted this in the other main subreddit, but it was deleted. I was advised to share in AITA_relationship instead. Unfortunately, I’m unable to reply to those who leave encouraging comments. I share it here because I needed advice too. Even now, I still wonder why I was ghosted and shunned like that. I want to know the truth, but I’m not sure if I can trust any of them.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** You know what happened, right?

Ethan wanted to date you but Anna told him you rejected his interest so he'd date her and him calling you made her feel threatened that her shady actions might be found out so she then made up more lies that turned other friends against you.

Now it's been long enough, and Ethan is no longer around, that she feels ""safe"" bringing you around again so she hit you up.

Odds are others told her to reach out because y'all were such good friends and, if you refuse to go, she'll tell them something that makes you look bad as your reason.

Regardless of whether you go or not, I'd contact someone who will be there and tell them that you won't attend because of the horrible way Anna treated you and that you just wanted someone to know the truth so that Anna can't lie about you yet again.

Don't go if you don't want to, but don't let her get away with lying about you again.

> **OOP:** 😮‍💨 It’s been six years, and I know I’ve healed and found better friends. My current best friends are the roommates who supported me during university. But why does it still hurt? Despite everything, I always believed my friendship with Anna was genuine.

**Commenter 2:** If I was you I'd steer clear. The fact that you said you had to rebuild yourself says alot. For being such ""good friends"" they sure abandoned you without even trying to see your side. They are either all dumb as fuck or not worth another thought.

> **OOP:** Yes, I felt deeply humiliated. My self-esteem plummeted, and I felt so small. But thanks to the kindness of those around me, my roommates and coursemates, I was able to rebuild myself and rise again. But still, I want answers but I'm afraid they are planning something or things like that. Like humiliating me at the reunion party. Maybe I watch too much Kdrama and Cdrama 😅

**Commenter 3:** ""Forgiveness if for my own peace"" is such a bullshit take.

You know why they blocked you. Ethan flipped the script and said you contacted him and tried to get him to leave her for you.

Block them.

> **OOP** The fact that I used to have a crush on him is disgusting.

**Commenter 4:** NTA. I would simply say, ""Thank you for the apology. I hope you understand why now, 6 years after the fact, I can't just be friends with you again."" and leave it at that.

> **OOP:** I don't even want to say anything to them tbh. I just ghosted them and it has been a few days. I don't know why it is important for me to come suddenly? Was it because I was the class president and it will look good in the picture?

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/SyBCHh32LF): **November 21, 2024**

I wanted to edit my previous post, but it's already too long.

Just a quick disclaimer: I created my Facebook account two weeks ago after mustering the courage from my past trauma. I used fake names and ages for anonymity. In reality, we’re all 29. My friendship with Anna fell apart when I was 23, and now, six years later, we’re 29. I know no one has noticed this so far, but I just wanted to clarify.

Some people from my previous post suggested that I reach out to Ethan. However, before I could do so, he reached out to me first. Yesterday, I received a friend request from him, along with a message saying ""Hi"" in my Messenger. So, we talked. He invited me for a coffee this weekend so we can talk about it, I told him to not push his luck and just answer me.

I asked him about his call that night. Since most boys were too intimidated to approach me, they often asked Anna to convey their feelings to me. Ethan was one of them. Apparently, a lot of boys had a crush on me back then. But at the time, only Anna received open confessions, so I assumed I was undesirable, not that it mattered to me. I was foolishly infatuated with Anna, so much so that I would have rolled out a red carpet for her to walk on if I could. She was my entire world back then.

Not even once have I ever heard about any boys in high school liking me from Anna. Apparently, Anna would always came back to them with her apologetic face, telling them that I had rejected them and repeating the insults I had supposedly said about them. No wonder some people back in high school called me arrogant and dislike me for some reason. I just thought it was because I was a strict class president and student commitee member. Unlike Anna who was friendly and charming, I was strict, sharp-tongued, and rarely smile. I don't owe anyone a smile.

Ethan explained that he was mean to me back then because Anna told him I had said he was ""an orphan abandoned by his parents."" This was a particularly sensitive topic for him, as he had been raised by his grandparents since childhood. He later discovered the truth when Anna inadvertently admitted it during an argument. That moment led him to file for divorce. Ethan shared that he genuinely did love Anna, but her constant insecurity and habit of bringing up my name in every argument strained their relationship. She either accused Ethan of still thinking about me or compared him to me.

Anna did found out about Ethan's drunken call that very same night. They had an argument, and Ethan came close to calling off the wedding, but Anna guilt-tripped him into staying.

Neither Ethan nor Anna lied or twisted the story.

Anna simply told our entire friend group to stop talking to me. They knew I hadn't done anything wrong, but somehow, it was still my fault that Ethan had unresolved feelings towards me. I was (and still am) an introvert, and most of my friends back then were hers. It wasn’t surprising that they followed her lead when she turned against me. They were always her friends, not mine. Anna and my ex classmates then painted me as a villain to the other friends from high school. Ethan didn't do anything to help me because he was manipulated to hate me, his words not mine.

That’s why I changed my number and deleted all my social media accounts. While no one directly bombarded me with mean messages, I constantly saw posts that seemed to be aimed at me, even though my name was never mentioned. Ethan only revealed everything to the other friends after his divorce with Anna was finalized. Now, Anna and my ex-classmates are the ones being shunned by the others since two years ago.

Ethan said he owed me an apology, though he knew it wouldn't be enough after everything that happened. While he never smeared my name, he stood on the sidelines and did nothing simply because I ""rejected"" him and called him an ""abandoned orphan"" during high school. He asked me if I will be going to the upcoming reunion party.

Turns out the reunion party this time was for the 1995 high school batch. My ex-classmates probably wanted their former class president to attend for appearances. I told him I won't go. He said I can sit with him and his ex-classmates if I wanted to. Why would I? Brother eugh. I told him I wouldn’t be attending because I have no friends from high school. He mentioned that the others would be sad if they heard I said that. Well, screw them.

I received a lot more messages from old friends but I didn't respond to any of them. I have no attachment towards them.

I told Anna that Ethan already told me everything. She called me on Messenger again, sobbing. She admitted she might have been a terrible friend, but that she did care about me. All those years, I was always on her mind. I was too attached to her back then because she was my first real friend, as I had no friends in middle school. I was too shy and quiet so I couldn't make friends. Anna taught me how to make friends and overcome my social anxiety, and introduce a lot of people to me.

I learned to cook for her and took care of her when she was sick. I even protected her from creeps. Everything I did was for her. Now that I think about it, it was kind of unhealthy. Maybe she wanted me to be that version of myself again, only for her convenience. She begged me to try again. That she would be a better person for me. But I just ended the call and blocked her. After a few minutes of contemplating, I decided to delete my facebook account again. I have a feeling that if I didn't, they will keep on bothering me. 😅 I'll settle with a fake account. The main reason why I made my facebook account is to play Harvest Town anyway. 🤣

Sorry for the long post. This will be my one and only update. I want to thank the four people who personally messaged me on Reddit. Your messages meant a lot, as not many people have done so much for me in my life. I hope my update answered your questions. Farewell. 🙋‍♀️

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Cause, perhaps, in a way she was? For all we know she liked op romantically, and simply never admitted those feelings (perhaps even to herself, cause even if it isn't strange for a ""mean girl"" to lie about the interest a boy she likes has for her friend, it is odd to do it to all love interests op had). How do I know? I'm a bisexual woman, admitting to myself that I liked other girls as a teenager, wasn't easy.

> **OOP:** Do you really think so?
> 
> I thought it was normal between female best friends to hold hands and sleep together.
> 
> I'm bisexual too.

**Commenter 2:** It's brave of you to confront your past. You're not obligated to forgive anyone. Prioritize your own peace and build healthy relationships moving forward.

> **OOP:** Thank you. I really do feel indifferent now. It has been six years, and I have better friends now. I'm content with my life.

**Commenter 3:** Nothing weird about holding hands and sleeping together (with full clothing on and just sleeping in the same bed, I mean). But rejecting all potential love interests is a red flag.

> **OOP:** Me and Anna never do anything. But she would always lean on my shoulder and hug me when sleeping. She always insisted that I sleepover at her house on the weekend.

**Commenter 4:** Perhaps Anna had feelings for you (this doesn't excuse any of her shitty behavior, honestly). It reminds me of a popular girl I knew in high-school (who liked me, but we were very incompatible, so I rejected her, let me tell you, she made my life as hard as she could for as long as we were in the same class). It doesn't excuse any of Anna's awful behavior, but it is a possibility.

> **OOP:** I doubt it, honestly. Maybe she just likes the idea of being taken care of. She had no problems throwing me away for Ethan.
> 
> But now that I think about it, our dynamic was weird. 🤦‍♀️
> 
> And maybe this is too much information, I didn't date back then and only hooked up with people because Anna didn't like them and she didn't agree.
> 
> And now, I have trust issues and am too afraid to commit in a relationship. It's not that I like to cheat or anything. I'm just too afraid to trust my life and my heart to someone else again.

So on tuesday night towards wednesday I woke up multiple times during the night because of pain in my middle stomach, maybe slightly on the right. It feels like a burning or an aching pain thats been waking me up every night since wednesday. Im not necessarily nauseous just in pain. The pain lessens a whole lot when i stand or sit upright.  

I have had chronic stomach pains for about 8 years that hasnt been diagnosed as anything, although this pain is very different compared to the ""normal"" pain. I also have severe anxiety and im scared it may just be me overthinking which is making the pain not go away. 

I eat a regular diet, havent had any soda/alcohol/coffee etc that i know may make it worse incase of an ulcer. I usually sleep heavy and undisturbed which is why i got concerned in the first place. I tried to call my doctor on friday but she was unreachable, i dont wanna force somebody to the er with me incase its just nothing. I have a slight history of thinking a lot of things are wrong with me and i dont wanna worsen that. Please help ;(",1,1732942895.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False
1h352l2,https://www.reddit.com/r/katebush/comments/1h352l2/facts_about_kate_bush/,Facts about Kate Bush,"She’s of English and Irish descent.

Born in Southeast London, Kate grew up in a family immersed in music, art and literature. She learned to play violin at age 11 but didn't like it; she began to set her poems to her own chord formulations.
* 		She started playing the piano a lot by age 12 to accompany her brother Paddy's fiddle playing and to generally let out her frustrations. By age 13 she had written many songs, some of which would later appear on her first 2 records.
* 		At age 14 Ricky Hopper, a family friend with connections to the music business, took her tape of 30 songs to all major record companies, with no success (her music was deemed too morbid and uncommercial). Kate seriously considered a career in psychiatry or social work, while Hopper took the tape to an old friend from Cambridge University, David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. Gilmour was impressed, and by age 15 Kate was recording demos in Gilmour's home studio. Again there is no interest from the record companies. Refusing to give up, Gilmour put up the money for a three-song demo done to full professional standards. This did the trick and EMI signed her a short while later. In an unusual move, EMI paid Kate to take a series of lessons to improve her already inventive songwriting as well as singing and dancing. Finally in 1978 ""Wuthering Heights"" was released and went straight to #1 in the UK. This made her an overnight sensation and sent her subsequent album, The Kick Inside, to #3, selling over 1 million copies in the UK. >> 
* 		When ""Wuthering Heights"" rose to #1 in 1978, Kate Bush became the first female to top the UK charts with a self-composed song.
* 		Bush rarely performs live and toured just once: a 24-show trek of Europe in 1979. Those shows were divided into three acts and interspersed with poetry, dancing, and magic.
* 		
* 		Instead of doing another tour, she turned her penchant for stagecraft into elaborate music videos and other visual elements to go along with her songs. In 2014, she staged a grand production called Before The Dawn at the Eventim Apollo in London, where she performed her songs amid a dazzling display of visual elements. It ran for 22 performances and caused such a stir that eight of her albums returned to the UK Top 40, making her the first female artist with that many albums on the chart simultaneously.
* 		Her 1980 album, Never For Ever, was the first commercially-released album to incorporate the Fairlight CMI digital sampling synthesizer. Bush incorporated the Fairlight on many of her subsequent releases, and the device achieved ubiquity in pop music of the decade.
* 		She rejected a song John Lydon, aka Johnny Rotten, wrote for her called ""Bird In Hand."" It was about rescuing parrots from the parrot trade in Brazil.
* 		Her 12-year hiatus between the releases of The Red Shoes and Aerial inspired the 2007 documentary Come Back Kate.
* 		She began producing her own albums with her fourth release, The Dreaming, in 1982. Featuring the hit lead single ""Sat In Your Lap,"" the album peaked at #3 in the UK, but was widely criticized for being too experimental and not commercial enough.
* 		Never For Ever, Hounds Of Love, and The Whole Story all hit #1 in the UK. The remaining eight albums landed in the Top 10.
* 		In the US, her highest-charting album is The Red Shoes, which peaked at #28 in 1993, and her top single is ""Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God),"" which landed at #30 in 1985.
* 		She had a longtime romance with her bassist/sound engineer Del Palmer until the early '90s. In 1992 she met guitarist Danny McIntosh while recording her album The Red Shoes and the pair married not long after. They welcomed a son, Bertie, in 1998.
* 		Although she's been nominated three times, Bush has never won a Grammy.
* 		She was asked to record the theme song to the James Bond film Moonraker but declined because she was about to embark on her 1979 Tour of Life. The gig went to Shirley Bassey.
* 		Kate Bush attended St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, Woolwich Road, Abbeywood in SE London. She wrote poems for the school magazine, including The Crucifixion, Blind Joe Death and Epitaph for a Rodent. Kate left school in 1976 walking away with 10 O-levels.
* 		Kate Bush was known as Cathy until she left school.
* 		Kate Bush made her first television appearance in Bio's Bahnhof, a German live music talk show presented by Alfred Biolek in a former train depot. She appeared, along with Udo Lindenberg and Vicky Leandros, on the ARD show's first ever episode dated February 9, 1978.

She is known to employ varied influences and meld disparate styles, often within a single song or over the course of an album.[42] Simon Reynolds of The Guardian called Bush ""the queen of art-pop"",[151] and she has also been described as art rock,[42][152] baroque pop,[153] avant-pop,[154][155] progressive pop,[156][157] and post-progressive.[158] Ben Myers of Prog called Bush ""prog's first pop star and pop's first prog star"" whose ""career history and collaborations are inextricably tied in with prog and her ever-evolving output has much more in common with the genre than the pop world in which she first found herself operating.""[159] She has been grouped with other ""'arty' 1970s and '80s British pop rock artists"" such as Roxy Music and Peter Gabriel.[160] Even in her earliest works, with piano the primary instrument, she wove together diverse influences, drawing on classical music, glam rock,[151] and a wide range of ethnic and folk sources. This has continued throughout her career. By the time of Never for Ever, Bush had begun to make prominent use of the Fairlight CMI synthesiser, which allowed her to sample and manipulate sounds, expanding her sonic palette.[19]
Bush has a soprano vocal range.[161] Her vocals contain elements of British, Anglo-Irish and most prominently (southern) English accents and, in its use of musical instruments from various periods and cultures, her music has differed from American pop norms.[162] Reviewers have used the term ""surreal"" to describe her music.[163] Her songs explore melodramatic emotional and musical surrealism that defies easy categorisation.[164] It has been observed that even her more joyous pieces are often tinged with traces of melancholy and vice versa.[165]

Songwriting and influences

edit
Elements of Bush's lyrics employ historical or literary references. This is embodied in her first single ""Wuthering Heights"", which is based on Emily Brontë's novel of the same name. She has described herself as a storyteller who embodies the character singing the song and has dismissed efforts by others to conceive of her work as autobiographical.[162][166][167] Bush's lyrics have been known to touch on obscure or esoteric subject matter, and New Musical Express noted that Bush was not afraid to tackle sensitive and taboo subjects in her work.[168] ""The Kick Inside"" is based on a traditional English folk song (The Ballad of Lucy Wan) about an incestuous pregnancy and a resulting suicide.[169] ""Kashka from Baghdad"" is a song about a gay couple; She has referenced G. I. Gurdjieff in the song ""Them Heavy People"", while ""Cloudbusting"" was inspired by Peter Reich's autobiography, A Book of Dreams, about his relationship with his father, Wilhelm Reich. ""Breathing"" explores the results of nuclear fallout from the perspective of a fœtus.[170]
Other non-musical sources of inspiration for Bush include horror films, which have influenced the gothic nature of her songs, such as ""Hounds of Love"", which samples the 1957 horror movie Night of the Demon.[171] ""The Infant Kiss"" is a song about a haunted, unstable woman's infatuation with a young boy in her care (inspired by Jack Clayton's film The Innocents (1961), which had been based on Henry James's novella The Turn of the Screw).[172][173] The title of the song ""Hammer Horror"" is from Hammer Film Productions' horror movies, and the song's story was inspired by the film Man of a Thousand Faces (1957).[174] Her songs have occasionally combined comedy and horror to form dark humour, such as murder by poisoning in ""Coffee Homeground"", an alcoholic mother in ""Ran Tan Waltz"" and the upbeat ""The Wedding List"", a song inspired by François Truffaut's 1967 film of Cornell Woolrich's The Bride Wore Black about the murder of a groom and the bride's subsequent revenge against the killer.[175] Bush has also cited comedy as a significant influence. She has cited Woody Allen,[176] Monty Python,[177] Fawlty Towers,[177] and The Young Ones[178] as particular favourites.

Technical innovations

edit
Bush is regarded as the first artist to have had a headset with a wireless microphone built for use in music.[179] For her Tour of Life in 1979, she had a compact microphone combined with a self-made construction of wire clothes hangers, so that she did not have to use a hand microphone. Having her hands free allowed Bush to dance her rehearsed choreography of expressionist dance on the concert stage and sing with a microphone at the same time. Her idea was later adopted by other artists such as Janet Jackson,[180] Madonna and Peter Gabriel.

According to Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, Bush's ""shadow looms so large that whenever a female singer-songwriter emerges who is even remotely out of the ordinary, it's only a matter of time before someone, fairly or otherwise, mentions Bush"".[182]

Musicians who have acknowledged Bush's influence include Bjork,[183] Alanis Morissette,[184] Nigel Godrich,[185] Florence Welch, Fever Ray,[186] Big Boi,[187] Regina Spektor,[188] Fiona Apple,[189] Imogen Heap,[190] Sharon Van Etten,[191] Ellie Goulding,[192] Kyros,[193] Aisles,[194] FKA Twigs,[195] Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy,[196] Grimes,[197] Solange Knowles,[198] Julia Holter,[199] Angel Olsen,[200] Halsey,[201] Tupac Shakur,[202][203] Robyn,[204] Caroline Polachek,[205][206] and Chappell Roan.[207]

Bush and guitarist Danny McIntosh have a son, Albert McIntosh, known as Bertie, born in 1998,[267][268] although whether they are married is unknown.[269] From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Bush was in a relationship with bassist and sound engineer Del Palmer.[270]
Bush is a former resident of Eltham in southeast London.[271] In the 1990s she moved to a canalside residence in Sulhamstead, Berkshire, and bought a second home in Devon in 2004.[79] Bush is a vegetarian.[272][273] Bush was raised a Roman Catholic. 

In 1999, she said:
I would never say I was a strict follower of Roman Catholic belief, but a lot of images are in there; they have to be; they're so strong. Such powerful, beautiful, passionate images! There's a lot of suffering in Roman Catholicism. I think I'm looking for not necessarily religion, but ways of helping myself to become more understanding, more complete, a happier person ... But I really don't think I've found a niche.

The length of time between albums has led to rumours concerning Bush's health or appearance.[178][274] In 2011, she told BBC Radio 4 that the amount of time between albums was stressful: ""It's very frustrating the albums take as long as they do ... I wish there weren't such big gaps between them"". In the same interview, she denied that she was a perfectionist, saying: ""I think it's important that things are flawed ... That's what makes a piece of art interesting sometimes – the bit that's wrong or the mistake you've made that's led onto an idea you wouldn't have had otherwise."" She reiterated her prioritisation of her family life.

1h34yss,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1h34yss/my_marriage_story/,My marriage story,"It’s my wife’s cake day. We have been together 14 years. I’m 39 she’s 43. I write her letters often explaining to her why I love her and why she is perfect to me, and her birthday is obviously a day she gets another letter for her collection. This is a post corresponding with the letter I wrote for her today that explains a day in our lives. Not a special day, just what an average day actually is, because honestly -it’s the best argument I have for why she is my person and we are meant for each other. I know you will read this baby, and hopefully, amidst the “my husband cheated on me” and the “my wife won’t sleep with me” posts that fill this sub some other people will too, and there can be a bit of happiness on Reddit for a second…

I wake up every morning grateful to be married to her and I know she feels the same way. I come downstairs and drink coffee and then we sit together, planning out our duties and tasks for the day. I can’t remember a time in the last year where this morning conversation did not include us cuddling and telling each other how much we love each other. Let’s say it’s a work day. After our tasks are figured out we both do our own thing for a while and then I go to work. When I get home late that night we have a ritual. She falls asleep on the couch waiting for me to get home (I’m a Food and Beverage director of a hotel and don’t get home most nights until after the restaurant closes, around 10:30 - 12pm mostly). I get her water ready, collect her phone and glasses and take them to the bedroom where I make the bed and set up her body pillow and spot. Then take the dogs out and bring them to bed. I then fold down the recliner with her in it and remove her blanket and pick her up and carry or walk her to bed and tuck her in and tell her I love her and kiss her, I lay on her and rock her for awhile, then go work out downstairs and make my dinner, brush my teeth and stuff and go up to bed, I climb in bed with her facing away from me and reach around her with my right arm and cup her left shoulder, then lift her up and lock her into a full spoon position. She wiggles into position making sure there is no spots where our skin isn’t touching and we sleep like that all night. We date regularly. 

On my days off we go for hikes and clean together, we split chores, we make good money, me a bit more than her but she handles the finances because she is the master of coin and I make the house better (I build stuff and have a shop in the basement). We have a joint account and have never argued about money and think it’s wild that people in relationships don’t pool all their resources and share everything. We both work, her at home as a programmer, me at a hotel. We have sex regularly. We watch tv together and cuddle at least two nights a week (I only have 2 nights where I get out early enough for a traditional evening). Mornings we spend together doing a specific kettlebell workout, talking, joking and planning. I do the shopping and the dishes and she does the laundry. I cook she makes the technologies work. We almost never argue. When we do it’s resolved quickly as we don’t keep secrets or hold grudges from each other, we just talk it out. I made a post for husbands in general who were complaining about sexless marriage here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/dyp1x4HHZc

She has anxiety and doesn’t like to leave the house so I am constantly trying to get her out and doing stuff with me or with friends. She’s a hypochondriac so I have little medical kit where I take her temperature, blood oxygen and blood pressure and listen to her heart and explain to her that she isn’t dying, it’s just a headache, or a stubbed toe - (the ailments vary).

I am so in love with her. I tell her that every day. She tells me she is so in love with me every day. We have our own friends and our couple friends. We trust each other, we aren’t jealous. We both think we won the jackpot and are married to the hottest girl and guy in the room. We read Reddit together and use it for our general drama and entertainment because we don’t have drama at home. We laugh, we joke, we have each other’s backs. We don’t understand how people cheat on each other. She is my person, I am hers.

I will die for her. I will burn the world with no moral qualms and sleep soundly at night if it means she is safe and happy. Usually that presents as writing her love notes and cleaning the living room. I suppose that’s the dragon I fight for her. She lies in my arms and tells me she needs me. I couldn’t be happier.

I know it started with the average day and then went into just a shit ton of things we do and are, but still… Reading this back to myself- there’s no lies here, I can’t think of a time we had a “bad day” due to each other in any way. This actually is our day to day life layout and it made for (in my opinion) a fairly compelling argument for why we should be married to each other.

Whether you're revamping your space or looking for ways to elevate your interiors, the right wall art can make a bold statement while tying together your overall design. Here’s how you can effectively use wall art to enhance your room while incorporating complementary [home decor items](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/), like [rattan basket](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/baskets), for a modern [home decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) look.

# 1. Start with a Focal Piece

* Choose a piece of wall art that grabs attention immediately when someone walks into the room. This could be a large canvas painting, a dramatic black-and-white photograph, or a vibrant abstract print.
* For a cohesive look, balance the boldness of your art with textured home decor items like rattan baskets or natural fiber rugs. These elements add warmth and dimension to modern home decor.

# 2. Play with Gallery Walls

* A gallery wall is a great way to make a statement while showcasing a variety of styles. Combine art prints, framed photos, and even woven decor pieces for an eclectic yet coordinated feel.
* Add small home decor items such as metallic accents or greenery in the form of wall-mounted planters to complement the gallery wall’s vibe.

# 3. Layer Textures and Materials

* Mix and match wall art styles to create depth. For example, pair a framed artwork with a woven wall hanging or a wooden sculpture.
* Incorporate a rattan basket on a nearby table or as a wall-mounted storage option. This ties together natural textures, enhancing the appeal of modern home decor.

# 4. Use Color to Anchor the Space

* Select wall art that aligns with your room’s color palette or contrasts dramatically to stand out. Bright, bold hues can energize a living room, while muted tones work best in bedrooms for a calming effect.
* Match accent colors from your artwork with smaller decor items, like throw pillows or vases, for a polished look.

# 5. Leverage Scale for Impact

* Oversized wall art can make a small room feel grand. In larger spaces, consider multiple smaller pieces that form a unified theme.
* If your wall art is large and colorful, balance the room with neutral decor, such as a rattan basket or a minimalist coffee table.

# 6. Tie Wall Art with Functional Decor

* In spaces like dining rooms or entryways, pair wall art with functional decor items. For example, a textured rattan basket beneath a bold piece of artwork can double as storage and an aesthetic complement.

# 7. Consider Themes and Style

* Stick to a theme to maintain cohesion. If you prefer modern home decor, opt for geometric or abstract pieces. For a boho-chic vibe, integrate macramé wall hangings or framed botanical prints.
* Surround the art with home decor items that echo its style, such as a rustic rattan basket for earthy tones or sleek metallic objects for a modern touch.

# 8. Think Beyond Walls

* Your wall art doesn’t have to stand alone. Use shelves to layer smaller art pieces with books, candles, and decorative baskets. This dynamic setup enhances visual interest.

# Conclusion

Wall art is more than just decoration—it’s an opportunity to express your personality and enhance the ambiance of any room. By incorporating complementary home decor items like rattan baskets and aligning with modern home decor aesthetics, you can create a space that feels both stylish and inviting.

1h34x3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1h34x3r/ceramic_vases_a_timeless_addition_to_any_interior/,Ceramic Vases: A Timeless Addition to Any Interior Design,"[Ceramic vases](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/vases/ceramic-vases) have long been celebrated as versatile decor pieces that seamlessly blend form and function. Whether you're a minimalist, a lover of eclectic design, or someone in between, ceramic vases offer an elegant way to elevate your interior space. From timeless [white ceramic vases](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/white-ceramic-vase) to the contemporary allure of [glass vases](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/vases/glass-vases), these pieces remain staples in home decor for their beauty, durability, and versatility.

# The Allure of Ceramic Vases in Interior Design

Ceramic vases hold a unique charm that transcends trends, making them a timeless addition to any home. Their handcrafted quality and organic shapes bring warmth and personality to spaces, whether placed in a modern living room, a rustic kitchen, or a bohemian bedroom.

One of the reasons ceramic vases are so beloved is their versatility. Use them as standalone statement pieces or pair them with fresh flowers, dried branches, or even pampas grass to add texture and life to your interiors. Their earthy, natural appeal effortlessly complements a wide range of interior design styles, from Scandinavian simplicity to industrial chic.

# Why White Ceramic Vases are a Must-Have

White ceramic vases are a classic choice for interior decorators. Their clean, neutral tone makes them incredibly easy to style with any color palette. Whether used as a focal point on a dining table or as subtle accents on a shelf, white ceramic vases add a touch of sophistication and serenity to any room.

These vases are especially impactful in minimalist or modern spaces, where their understated elegance shines. Pair a cluster of white ceramic vases in varying sizes and shapes for a chic monochromatic look, or combine them with glass vases for a mix of textures that exude contemporary flair.

# The Perfect Pairing: Ceramic and Glass Vases

For those who love mixing materials, ceramic and glass vases are a perfect match. Glass vases offer a transparent, delicate quality that contrasts beautifully with the solid, tactile nature of ceramics. Together, they create a dynamic visual appeal that enhances any space.

For instance, consider placing a white ceramic vase alongside a clear glass vase on your entryway console table. Fill the glass vase with vibrant blooms to add a pop of color, while the ceramic vase serves as a subtle, grounding element. This combination not only adds visual interest but also highlights the unique qualities of each material.

# How to Style Ceramic Vases in Your Home

1. **On the Dining Table**: Use a tall white ceramic vase as a centerpiece. Fill it with eucalyptus or dried branches for a natural, elegant look that doesn’t obstruct conversation.
2. **In the Living Room**: Create a vignette on a coffee table with a mix of ceramic vases in neutral tones. Add a small glass vase with fresh flowers to tie the arrangement together.
3. **On Shelves**: Style a group of ceramic vases in varying sizes and textures on your bookshelf. Leave some empty and fill others with seasonal blooms or grasses.
4. **In the Bathroom**: A small white ceramic vase with a single stem of greenery can instantly freshen up the space, creating a spa-like atmosphere.

# Why Ceramic Vases Are a Sustainable Choice

Ceramic vases are not just beautiful; they’re also an eco-friendly decor option. Made from natural materials like clay, they are durable and long-lasting, reducing the need for frequent replacements. When thoughtfully sourced, ceramic vases can also support local artisans and promote sustainable practices in home decor.

# Where to Buy the Best Ceramic Vases

When shopping for ceramic vases, look for high-quality craftsmanship and timeless designs that will endure. Whether you’re drawn to classic white ceramic vases or want to experiment with textured or patterned pieces, investing in well-made vases ensures they remain staples in your decor for years to come.

For those who enjoy a mix of materials, don’t overlook the charm of combining ceramic vases with glass vases. Together, they create an effortlessly chic look that enhances your home’s ambiance.

**Conclusion** Ceramic vases are more than just containers for flowers—they are timeless decor pieces that can transform any interior. From the understated elegance of white ceramic vases to the modern charm of glass vases, these versatile pieces offer endless styling possibilities. Whether you’re refreshing a room or designing a space from scratch, ceramic vases are the perfect addition to any design palette.

1h34wrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1h34wrk/frustrated_eureka_silenzio_and_breville_roma/,Frustrated [Eureka Silenzio and Breville Roma],"I'm frustrated. I've got a Breville Roma, which is admittedly not a great machine, but I thought with my new Eureka Silenzio I could GRIND FINER and get a decent espresso. It took me about 3 weeks and a scale off Amazon, but I managed to find a recipe that was drinkable: 3.25 grind, 14g in, 35-45g out (more about this in a moment) and correspondingly different pull times.

I burned through my first bag in the first two weeks, with wildly varying amounts of coffee coming out, but started enjoying my espresso (same roast/bean/supplier) around the time I got my second bag. Then suddenly about week 4, I was trying a slightly finer grind after some feedback on my flow, and the machine became unable to push water through the puck.

My puck prep is as consistent as I can make it, without any accessories other than a tamper off Amazon and me trying to apply the same amount of tamping each time. At first I chalked it up to too much tamping, so I eased off, no dice. Then I went back to my previous grind setting--same issue. I chalked that up to retention, so I pulled a few more shots. Nothing coming out. So I went crazy today and pulled a shot with a 3.5 grind, which previously flowed way too quickly... nothing coming out.

I can't decide whether I need a new machine (I've been looking for Bambino Plus deals in Canada this week), if the Roma has a problem (it sounds the same as always, just no water coming out) or if dialing in espresso is sorcery. ARGH!",1,1732942245.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1h34vs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/systemofadown/comments/1h34vs0/facts_about_serj_tankian/,Facts about Serj Tankian,"Tankian grew up listening to traditional Armenian music in his exiled community in Lebanon and sang it with his father Khatchadour Tankian.

He discovered pop music only once his family moved to Los Angeles in the 70s via the Bee Gees' soundtrack to Saturday Night Fever, that led him to delve into it. In his 20s, he bought every record by the Beatles, whom he has called the most ""universal"" artists he is aware of.

Tankian said that the first hard rock album that left an impact on him was 1992's Angel Dust by Faith No More.

When System of a Down toured with Faith No More singer Mike Patton, who at the time fronted his other band Mr. Bungle on the 2000 SnoCore Tour, Tankian said that both vocalists ""had some of the most interesting conversations"" of his life.

Besides the experimental vocals of Patton, Tankian is greatly influenced by Frank Zappa, especially by his albums Sheik Yerbouti and Joe's Garage.

Tankian holds in high regard the soundtrack of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly by Ennio Morricone, and the albums Decoy by Miles Davis and …And Justice for All by Metallica. He also much admires the reinvention that the British band Radiohead went through in their 2000 record Kid A, saying that it serves as an example to other artists.

Tankian is passionate about human rights, recognition of genocides, and social justice. These traits have helped to shape his lyrical style. He has organized and participated in many protests, from Armenian genocide recognition to Axis of Justice (AOJ) protests held by him and AOJ co-founder Tom Morello.

He also covers current issues in his music. In his music, issues like the War on Terror, overpopulation, genocide, environmentalism, and the American prison system are addressed. He and his System of a Down bandmates were featured in the 2006 documentary film Screamers, which covers the United States' position on genocide. In the film, Tankian interviews his grandfather, Stepan Haytayan, a survivor of the Armenian genocide, who recounts his experience of it.

Views on religion

Tankian said in an interview that he has ""the same religion as that tree over there"". He said, ""It's a mix of Native American, Christian, Buddhist, and Transcendental ideas. I like to think of Earth as mother. I like to think of sky as grandfather. God has been used for ulterior motives"". In another interview, he said, ""I believe very firmly that indigenous populations had a really good, intuitive understanding of why we're here. And we're trying to gain that same understanding through psychology and intellect in modern civilization"".

Tankian is an advocate of environmental and animal protection. He became a vegetarian, claiming in an interview with PETA that his change was due to ""touring and its variety of edible crap"", and he also felt it was ""instinctive somewhat"". Furthermore, he also feels the need for respect toward ""mother earth"".

In July 2009, he signed a PETA petition against the slaughtering methods of chickens in KFC slaughterhouses.

However, in 2024 Tankian stated in an interview on the popular YouTube channel Mythical Kitchen that he had begun eating meat again the year prior.

On June 9, 2012, Tankian married his long-time girlfriend Angela Madatyan, an Armenian woman from Vanadzor, in a private ceremony in Simi Valley, California.

On October 24, 2014, he announced that they had a son. The family lives intermittently between Warkworth, New Zealand and Los Angeles as of 2015.

Tankian is the brother-in-law of his System of a Down bandmate John Dolmayan, as their respective wives are sisters.

In 2018, Tankian founded Kavat Coffee, a company that focuses on Armenian coffee.

* 		Was a CEO for a computer software company before joining System of a DownSerj owns his own record label which is called 'Serjical Strike Records'.He wrote the lyrics and music for the System of a Down song 'Shimmy'.Serj has also sung in other bands for certain songs such as Mushroom Cult by Dog Fashion Disco, and lent his vocals to the song Mein by Deftones. He produced ""Enter The Chicken"" by Buckethead, and provided vocals to the Buckethead songs We are One, Coma and Waiting Here.

Tankian is regarded as one of the best vocalists in heavy metal, with praise given to his unusual delivery and his wide vocal range. In 2006, he was ranked No. 26 on the Hit Parader list of ""Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists"".

A study conducted by VVN Music found that Tankian possesses a high and diverse vocal range of 4.2 octaves.

Vocalist for Grammy Award winning American rock band System of a Down whose members are of Armenian heritage and their songs often have political lyrics like the P.L.U.C.K. about the 1915 Armenian Genocide and the Prison Song which criticizes the prison systems; former song is featured in Ararat (2002) by Armenian Atom Egoyan, who admired the genius Soviet-Armenian Sergei Parajanov whose political imprisonment is condemned in Mikhail Vartanov's Parajanov: The Last Spring (1992)

Good evening (currently 10:30 PM), F 25 interested in swinging back into my writing life. The big bad depression bug bit, but now I’m back. I’m frequently described as quirky, sensitive, kind, thoughtful, playful, and a bit of a hippie.  Writing recently has been kind of hard, but I’m slowly finding my motivation again! I’m craving an AMAZING story to get the juices flowing again.

I’m most interested in finding someone that I can chat with ‘out of character’ just as easily as I can send a roleplay reply to. One of the more important deciding factors of my partners for me is how I click with them on a personal level.  Writing back and forth to an anonymous internet person is fun I suppose, but what gets me excited is a friend on the other side of the messages who is enjoying every moment just as much as I am. 

Please be 23+, within 6 hours of CST, at least decent grammar and spelling capabilities (I get everybody makes mistakes), romance is pretty important to me within the roles.  slow burn is preferred! 

Universes I am interested in exploring: 
- Bridgerton/Queen Charlotte (would also enjoy adding more fantasy elements) 
- The Vampire Diaries/The Originals
— ACOTAR

Pairings/Settings I am interested in exploring: 
- Royal court drama (pick and choose any member)
- Military personnel/civilian in a sci fi setting
- Dnd type adventure (not in the DM way, just setting) 
- Monsters and humans oh my! 
- open to hearing your ideas if you’re looking for a pal and writing partner in one!!

Her long blonde curls bounced softly as she walked towards the counter, her hips visibly swaying even beneath her heavy winter coat.  The clatter of dishes being thrown into the sink, the bathroom door swinging open and shut, and the quiet hum of the heater running snapped him back to reality from his day dreams.

I live with him and he buys me coffee and small things occasionally but is that making up for the money or do I still have the right to ask for it.
He also did the same thing to my brother (17m), having him run out and grab stuff from the store and dinner, then just never giving him the money like he said he would. 
I know he technically doesn’t owe me anything bc he raised me and gives like 200 every christmas and birthday, but we aren’t tight on bills or any thing. And he isn’t a bad guy either.

This really cute girl ended up being the one to help me (at Suit Supply, you are assigned someone to assist you when they are available. You can't really just walk around and shop.) We flirt, she helps me for about an hour, I leave. Didn't think a ton of it. I ended up needing a black tie so I went back the next day and she came straight to me to help me out - we flirted more. I had just gone to the dry cleaners so I pull out the ticket which had my phone # on it and told her she should call/text me and we should have coffee. 

Ok - 2 months later she texts me. We have now gone on 5 dates and they've all been awesome. 

* On our 1st date, she tells me she is still married and getting a divorce (I am ok with the married part - still in the process of the divorce I am torn on). She is also still living with the man she is married to...(This I'm not comfortable with)
* She is, essentially, a professional musician by trade based on her schooling and performing in Belarus. She tutors kids and teaches at a school. The side gig at Suit Supply is only her summer work until school is back. 
* I do have her full name and have done extensive background checks bc I was getting nervous after I saw more and more signs of weirdness but very little comes up or is inconclusive. She has only lived in the US for 7 years, she's married to a Belarussian 22 years older than her, and all of her social media (only FB) has very little on it. Her FB profile pic was changed days before she 1st texted me. Being the female in her traditional relationship and her husband making the money, everything is owned by him and I don't have his name.
* The one time I tried to kiss her, she completely backed away and (as she is very shy in certain ways) essentially said she isn't ready for that. IDK if that means she is waiting for her divorce to be done, she isn't over him or idk wtf. There could be a lot of reasons and the fact she's dating while still getting a divorce/why I'm even dating her is the red flag in itself.

I realize I sound like a total psyko having dug so deep into this girl after so little time but I rarely date and when I do the dates suck. I really hit it off with her and admired how forward she was. I have epilepsy and when she was brave enough to tell me she was still married on our FIRST date I was pleasantly surprised she was willing to be so vulnerable - my last gf was the exact opposite, which led to our demise. When I share I have epilepsy to my dates, most go running for the hills and I strongly believe (and encourage others to) that just 1 thing doesn't define someone.

1h34bdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1h34bdn/should_i_continue_this_mentorlike_friendship_or/,"Should I Continue This Mentor-Like Friendship, or Am I Right to Feel Uncomfortable?","
I’ve been talking to a woman much older than me (she’s in her 40s, and I’m in my early 20s) who I met through a Facebook support group. At first, I reached out because she commented on a post I made about wanting to visit a religious site to heal from some really traumatic experiences. Initially, we just talked about the site, but then she asked about my trauma, and I shared a snippet. From there, we started talking more regularly, and I opened up about my past.

Since then, this relationship has evolved into what feels like a mentor-like friendship. She calls me regularly to check on me and give me life and career advice. She’s a brand manager and keeps encouraging me to pursue marketing analytics because of my prior experience in marketing, but I’ve made it clear that I don’t want to work in that field anymore. I’ve told her I want to transition into finance, but she dismisses that and says things like, “I think you should stick to one thing.” Her advice often feels invalidating, as though she’s not listening to what I actually want.

One time, I told her about a LinkedIn situation where I reached out to someone who didn’t respond. She said it was “stupid” to delete the connection and that “people don’t owe you anything.” That really rubbed me the wrong way because I feel like I should prioritize relationships with people who value and respect me. Instead, it felt like she was telling me to lower my standards and bow down to others’ behavior, which made me uncomfortable. At times, she even says things like, “This person’s advice is 1000% correct,” or that I should be “extremely thankful and grateful” for other people’s behavior, which feels dismissive of my feelings.

Another time, she wanted to give me some of her old clothes and other items she didn’t use anymore. I told her my parents wouldn’t be comfortable with that, but she kept insisting she could drop them off at my house. I eventually convinced her to meet me in a coffee shop parking lot instead, but when I brought the stuff home, my mom saw it, got really upset, and broke down crying, asking, “Why is this woman so involved with you?” She ended up giving the items away the next day, and her suspicions about this woman only grew stronger. My mom thinks it’s weird for someone to be so invested in me without a clear reason, and she often says things like, “No one does things like this for no reason.”

I’ve also had some moments of reflection about this relationship. I’ll admit that I sometimes get egotistical because I feel like my family has a lot of smart, successful people in it, and I should be raising my standards for the people I let into my life. This woman’s advice often feels like it’s coming from someone I perceive as “bottom-tier” or lacking the kind of insight I’m seeking. That makes me question if this relationship is even worth continuing.

On top of all this, I’ve had really bad experiences with people in the past—""friends"" who took advantage of me or didn’t have my best interests at heart. Because of that, I’m naturally skeptical of people who get too involved in my life. My therapist says her behavior isn’t weird, but my family and friends think it’s strange and that I should be cautious.

I’m stuck between feeling ungrateful and wanting to cut ties. Am I overthinking this because of my past experiences, or are my feelings valid? How do I set boundaries without feeling like I’m burning a bridge unnecessarily? Is it okay to step back from this relationship if it’s making me uncomfortable, even if she’s trying to help?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
