I'm working on a new business idea for a future project, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.  
  
**Name:** Espacio Aisén  
**Industry:** It's a coworking space with small offices, specially designed for people in creative fields like graphic design, architecture, software development, photography, and more. There's also a public coffee bar for everyone to enjoy.  
**Target:**  
\- For the coworking space: Creative Freelancers, Students in Creative fields, Digital Nomads, Remote Workers.  
\- For the coffee bar: Professionals or students who want great coffee, a place to network, chill out, or meet up with clients.  
\- Extras: Anyone attending events, workshops, or small conferences on a variety of topics.

**Business Model:**  
**Product / Service:** Espacio Aisén is a coworking space and coffee bar designed for professionals and students in creative fields. We've got all the cool stuff creators need, like ergonomic furniture, computers for 3D modeling and rendering, a plotter service for architects and designers, a virtual reality room, phone booths, and more. Plus, our coffee bar is open to anyone who loves great coffee and wants a quality drink.  
**What Makes Us Different:** We're all about catering to individuals rather than big companies or corporations, which is what most coworking spaces focus on. We also keep things super flexible—you can grab daily or hourly passes, monthly memberships, or even just order something from the coffee menu and use the coworking space.  
**Revenue incomes:** 

* Selling daily passes, renting private offices, and monthly memberships.
* Selling drinks and snacks from the coffee bar to the members and outsiders.
* Hosting monthly events like small conferences, software workshops, and even fun things like book clubs!
* Renting out extra accessories and furniture for coworking.

This idea came from my own need as a remote worker. There are days when I just want to leave the house and work in a space with other people. But coworking spaces in my city are way too expensive and mostly cater to companies. So, I usually end up at a coffee shop. The problem is, working in a café isn’t exactly comfortable—it’s noisy, and the furniture isn’t made for working long hours.

I think combining these two business models (coworking and coffee shop) could complement each other really well and make the whole thing a profitable business.

**Inoknina Anatolia (MARCHUK)**



This episode was shared with me by a childhood friend. Her story brings a bright smile and reminds us how attention to our loved ones can color both them and our lives. 



My friend Nika is a big fan of aesthetic little things for the house, beautiful dishes and other “atmospheric” household items. Every corner of her home is an elaborate work of art. And she especially loves interesting items for tea serving - instruments, decorative details and, of course, cups.



One morning Nika was drinking coffee while sitting at her computer, and on the Internet she came across a photo of an unusual tea pair - the saucer in this pair was made in the form of an elegant pad. Those who periodically browse Pinterest, probably saw it.



Nika immediately caught fire and on her way to work started looking for where to buy this beauty. In her mind she already saw a tea table with such cups, flowers and... many variants were born in her imagination.



However, this day she could not go to the store after work - it was on the other side of the city, and Nika decided to postpone the purchase for tomorrow, when her schedule would be more free.



Nika returned home, entered the apartment and... stopped on the threshold of the living room. On the table she saw as many as six tea pairs with those very pads, and in the center of the table was a large bouquet of tulips!



It was like a fairy tale wish coming true at the wave of a magic wand. After all, she had never told anyone that she wanted to buy them! How had this little miracle happened?



While she was standing there, before she could even guess what was wrong, her smiling husband entered the room:



\- Hello, darling! How was the surprise?



\- You... saw them in the browser? - she finally guessed.



\- Yes, - the husband smiled again. - I thought I'd get ahead of you. And make you happy. Did it work?



...And yet, sensitivity and attention to others can create miracles - both big and small. Such moments, like puzzle pieces, can brightly color and decorate the “panel” of our daily life. And for eternal life, I want to believe, they are not wasted.",1,1742407752.0,SophiaWisdomOfGod,0,1.0,False

Smeg offers several blender models, each with its own unique features and target audience. Understanding the differences between these models is crucial when deciding wich Smeg blender to buy. While specific model lines may evolve into 2025, the core offerings and philosophy are likely to remain similar.

*   **The Smeg BLF01 Jug Blender:** This is the flagship model, the one most people picture when they think of a Smeg blender. It boasts a powerful motor (typically around 600W), a durable tritan jug, and a range of pre-set programs for smoothies, ice crushing, and pulse blending. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of tasks, from making morning smoothies to preparing homemade sauces.

So I met up with a good friend of mine for coffee and we were talking and I was giving her updates on my 5 month old and everything was going great. Until she brought vaccines. I want to preface this with she is an ER nurse at our hospital. She asked if we had vaccinated our daughter, and not thinking the harm in saying we have I said yes...biggest mistake of my life.

My nurse friend proceeds to tell me that ""vaccines do cause SIDS whether the research wants to admit it or not and babies do die from getting shots. I don't know how you could risk your Childs life giving them a shot. It's in gods hands for a health baby.""

I honestly had no words for her. We are in opposite fields - her nursing and myself in engineering. Both centered around research, science, and facts. I told her ""thank you for your opinion; however, after extensive research my husband and I have decided that we would rather have our daughter vaccinated than leave it up to fate.""

I guess what bother's me the most is here is someone in the medical field shaming me for protecting my baby. How can nurse's who have gone to school, been educated in the increase in mortality rates due to vaccines and wellness checkups now disregard those scientifically proven facts for their own beliefs. How can they disregard the women of 100 years ago who would have killed to have the modern medicine we do today to keep their babies alive and by their side. I guess I don't get it.

Being vulnerable carries an inherent risk but with right person makes it all worth it

I think most of us are afraid in some sense to love and to be completely vulnerable yet despite the risk we long for it.

I find myself deeply longing for a sincere and profound connection. Hopefully, you are looking for the same?

The capacity to love, sometimes even in the face of pain, is one of the most beautiful aspects of being human. It's a strength, and not always a weakness.

At my core, I'm a person of love, of care, of deep unyielding affection for those I hold dear.

Through the journey of healing and self-discovery, I've realized that I have much love to share. Love that is not bitter, but kind; not resentful, but forgiving; not closed, but open and willing to grow alongside someone special.

I'm invested in my attempt to forge a connection and hope you are too, I'd try to share things about me that might give you idea of the person I am.

**Essence of Me:**

I am a mix of old-school romance and modern sensibility, holding onto the ideals of loyalty and sincerity. I think handwritten notes, surprise dates, and the belief that small gestures make a big difference. I am someone who thrives on deep connections and meaningful interactions.

I’m someone who believes in the power of midnight conversations, in the healing balm of shared laughter, and in the silent solidarity of presence.

I believe in the power of empathy and the importance of being there for those who matter, even if it's a call at 3 AM. I value integrity, kindness, and a good/weird sense of humor. I find beauty in the mundane, the kind of person who finds joy in the little things and believes in taking the time to truly understand and appreciate others.

Physical Attributes:

* Height: 5'11"" (181cm)
* Build: Slim
* Hair: Straight Deep black, kept in check
* Eyes: Brown
* Beard: Short, fashionable, and pristinely groomed
* Complexion: Tanned, Caramel toned

**Interests:**

I find solace in music that echoes my moods, books that transport me to other worlds, and quiet moments in nature that ground me. I cherish activities that nurture growth, whether they're intellectual debates, serene walks, or shared laughs over coffee. I'm drawn to the arts as much as to the simple pleasure of a sunset.. I also have a keen interest in cooking and experimenting with new recipes, finding the act of creating something delicious for others as a form of expression and care.

To sum up some typical interests include: Philosophy, nature, languages, books, reading, writing, video games, sports, art, poetry, travelling etc

**What I Am Looking For:**

I'm in search of someone who values open and honest communication as much as I do. Someone who understands that relationships are about growth, learning, and supporting each other through life's myriad challenges and joys. I am looking for someone who is eager to prioritize getting to know each other, willing to open their heart, and ready to build something meaningful together.

Expectations:

* Mutual respect and understanding
* Openness and honesty in communication
* A shared desire to prioritize our relationship and growth
* An interest in exploring life's depths and joys together

**The Quest for You:**

What am I seeking? Not a perfect person, but a real one. Someone whose heart speaks the language of kindness, whose spirit dances to the tune of sincerity. I dream of a connection where words are just the beginning, where vulnerability is not a weakness but our strongest bond. I yearn for a love that’s both a safe harbor and a grand adventure, a partnership built on mutual respect, understanding, and the shared bravery of baring one’s soul.

I seek a fellow traveler in this journey of life, one who understands that while our pasts may shape us, they do not define us. Someone who stands at the intersection of hope and reality, ready to embark on a path not devoid of challenges but rich with the promise of true companionship.

**Epilogue of Hope:**

If my words have stirred something in your heart, if you too are navigating the vast oceans of life in search of a genuine connection, then perhaps we are two stars meant to align in the constellation of fate. I extend my hand, my heart, and my story to you – not in desperation, but with the quiet confidence of one who has faced the night and yearns for the dawn.

Let’s explore the **scientific evidence** and expert insights in detail.





# 2. Scientific Studies on Coffee and Heart Health

Many studies have analyzed the relationship between coffee and heart health. Here are some of the most notable findings:

# ✅ Coffee May Reduce the Risk of Heart Disease

Another **meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition** reviewed multiple studies and concluded that moderate coffee consumption reduces the risk of heart disease due to its high antioxidant content.

# ⚠️ High Coffee Consumption and Increased Blood Pressure

A study in the **Journal of the American Heart Association** found that drinking **more than 5 cups of coffee per day may raise blood pressure**, leading to potential cardiovascular risks, especially for people with hypertension.

**Key Takeaway:** **Moderate coffee intake (2-3 cups daily) is beneficial, but excessive consumption may increase blood pressure and heart risks.**

# ��2. Coffee May Lower the Risk of Heart Failure

A study from **Harvard University** found that people who drank **moderate amounts of coffee had a 30% lower risk of heart failure**.

The researchers suggested that **caffeine helps improve heart function by enhancing blood circulation and reducing arterial stiffness**.

A few weeks ago my partner broke up with me, we’d been arguing on and off for a while (these started after she started working there) and as far as I had thought things just got too much, I found out today that as soon as we broke up, she started sexting her manager and telling people she gets butterflies and likes him,

Before we broke up Sarah and John would always go out on little coffee “dates” just to chat which I thought was fine and it didn’t bother me as I knew she struggled with her mental health and she has low level autism, so it would be good for her to have someone at work to talk to, she was also getting a promotion she started mentioning John a lot, like a hell of a lot, and randomly started accusing me of liking this other girl I’m friends with.

 I told her I will block her if she’s really that worried, I was about to do it and she told me not to, that it wouldn’t be fair.

A few weeks before we broke up I made a joke, as Sarah and John went for coffee then went for icecream, I jokingly said it sounded like a date, this made her really angry, even though I pointed out it was a joke and I’m genuinely not bothered as I know I’m the one she’s dating, and I trust her

I then found out she went to another town to see him after telling me that shes “only going for food” and it’ll be like “she’s getting on the busses for fun”
I then found out they spent 4 hours in a dessert place,  after I noticed she was still in this town at 7:30 pm

I messaged asking if she was good as she said she wouldn’t be there long and it was starting to get late, and she told me she was shopping(when all the shops were closed) I called her out on it later that day and she told me she was with John, that they bumped into eachother, I did think this was weird as whenever we had been to that town together she never bumped into him.


 I told her I know she lied and she said “I didn’t want you to get annoyed or uncomfortable so I panicked” and I said I understand as her exes had been insecure and abusive and we’re weird about her even being friends with guys, even if it did bother me

A few days later I found out she had lied about something else and if I’m being honest I kinda spiralled and kinda went off on her, not too much I wasn’t being threatening or anything if that’s how the wording comes across, more like “I know you lied about something else” “please talk to me” “the way you’re being makes me think you cheated”

After I said all this she ran straight to John to see him and talk to him about it, breaking up with me later that day saying she didn’t love me anymore and that we were just hurting each other

It’s been 16 days since we broke up, we’ve had a couple conversations, one where it was like nothing happened and the other where she got really annoyed out of no where and blamed me for everything that went wrong

I found out earlier today through one of her friends that as soon as we broke up they started sexting, and she had been telling them and other people she was getting butterflies and that she liked him, she even told her super strict, no nonsense parents that she liked him (who were not happy at all from what I was told) and that she wants to move out to be with him as they disagree with it 

I don’t know how to feel about it, I’m hurt and in pain, aswell and angry, but I’m not mad at her or angry at her, I just want her to know she’s fucking her life up as she had so much going for her, but I can’t do a damn thing as it’ll only push him towards him more, I feel like an anvil is on my chest and I just want to scream as she’s been emotionally cheating on me and accusing me of doing exactly that, which I kinda realise that might be why 


But I really don’t know what to do I’ve never been in this situation before and I would’ve given her the world, I loved her more than anything, it just really hurts 




A few more things I’d like to add:

He thought she was 17 when she started working there

She’s been working there 6 months 

I had taken accountability as arguments do take 2 people and I had apologised to her for it, but as far as she’s aware she hasn’t done anything wrong it was all me

I think he’s praying on her, and using her mental health to get her attached, she has depression and just wanted someone to understand her

As I mentioned she’s getting a promotion, I think it’s because he was attracted to her and wanted her to like him more

We are in the same class and met around seven months ago. I’m a fairly quiet introverted person, and so I don’t have many friends, and she’s the same, so we became pretty good friends. (We also have jobs together in the same coffee shop)
Well, the other day we were at work, and tbh I have no idea how we got to this topic, but we started talking about suicide. And my friend said she thinks people who commit suicide are stupid. She said she thinks it’s ‘cheating’, and that people who kill themselves are ‘cheating out of life’ I was honestly appalled, and said, ‘you think they’re stupid??’ And she said yes. She said it’s an easy way out, but in the end you go to hell for killing yourself, so it doesn’t even make a difference, and it’s stupid. 
At this point I was at a loss for words. 
My best friend from when I was 9 until I was 13 tried to kill herself, and after she wasn’t successful she cut me and all our other friends off. But I saw and felt second hand exactly what she was going through, and the pain she was feeling and the suffering she endured. 
My friend (from today, the 16yr old) has no way of knowing this because I didn’t tell her ever, but I’m just shocked. I’m glad she doesn’t get the pain that people who consider killing themselves go through, because that means she isn’t going through that, but I’m just so. . . Idk how to describe how I’m feeling.

A lot of damage. Somehow, over the years, I found a way to continue resistance training with resistance bands…and despite the damage and hardware, I’m able to maintain a muscular frame at age 45. I had my first surgery at 24 years, and I thought my active life was finished. 

Turns out, I can’t sit comfortably for too long, sleeping isn’t great, but in terms of activity, I can move. Spine pain is an existential crisis, that’s what JFK said. I wake up every day in code black pain 10. It takes an hour for me to shake off the negative thoughts and acute pain. I can barely lift a cup of coffee. Two ibuprofen, caffeine, and an hour, then I’m good for a while. It’s a daily battle, a character builder. If I was writing this 4 hours ago? I’m not sure I’d be able to write about a way forward. But it’s only left foot-right foot and purpose. My twin daughters know I lack mobility from left to right and I have zero lateral flexion—classic stiff neck look—but besides my having a “robot neck,” there’s no signs that I’m essentially fused from the base of my skull to the middle of my back. 

In the first few years I grew reliant on all the painkillers that were being just about handed out to us, right before they were locked up and we were necessarily a new contagion in a shadow epidemic. The pills work, of course. But with each medication, I knew I was trading in my freedom bit by bit, before I’d need a massive dose to stay well. Frankly, those were the hardest years. Believing there’d be some magic balance of relaxant, opioid, nerve medication, sleeping pill, and an upper to dial myself in. Lately I daydream about the latest expensive solution, but I know it would end up being the same road. 

All that to say: maybe there’s a 24 year old guy in here who’s just like I was, with a neck that’s a millimeter from being broken and a spirit that’s been crushed all the way through. My prognosis was so grim that I was prescribed palliative medications to keep me comfortable. Dark days. But day by day, one step at a time uphill towards a worthy destination, and maybe we can manage. I keep my chin up. Because I can’t move my chin at all. ",2,1742406547.0,spinalfusion,0,1.0,False

I felt uncomfortable and I asked her if she wouldn’t mind if I did the same? And she said no. 

Another time, she mentioned that she doesn’t seem wrong to talk to someone if they approach hitting on her while on vacations. As long as there are boundaries. Which for me, it is very odd again. 

A couple of days ago, I asked her the name of the ex that she could potentially have coffee with, and she said that she doesn’t feel comfortable talking about her past and she doesn’t want to give me a name and she has the right of having privacy. I feel very angry, to be honest, and I feel that it is sketchy as hell. 

She has been secretive about other things in the relationship before and it’s always an issue when I ask her things about the past that have impact in our present. 

I actually don’t know how to move forward after this? I’m wondering if breaking up with her is me overreacting to this.

28F here and I’ve been training for my first marathon (happening in less than a month from now). Would say I was average fitness before this training block (have been running for a bit). My schedule is running 3x per week (easy, tempo and long run), 1 yoga session and 1 weight session. Not aiming for time particularly (predicting it will be less than 5 hours). 

Anyways, the last few weeks I’ve been feeling absolutely exhausted - like I can’t focus at work and I’m feeling tired all the time. This means I’ve been having to have extra coffees and also been eating more than I usually do to help combat the tiredness and exhaustion.

This inspired me to share with you an interesting pattern in Hungarian: how we create place names from food and drinks. 

*You can find the link to the full video lesson (in Hungarian, with Hungarian and English subtitles) here:* [*https://www.patreon.com/posts/mini-hungarian-124406450*](https://www.patreon.com/posts/mini-hungarian-124406450) *- it's free!* 

Observe:

1.  
rétes (strudel) ➟  
rétesezik (to eat strudel) ➟  
rétesező (a place where you can eat strudel)

2.  
fagyi (ice cream) ➟  
fagyizik (to eat ice cream) ➟  
fagyizó (a place where you can eat ice cream)

We can basically make a place out of any food and drink using this logic: 

* lángos ➟ lángosozik ➟ lángosozó 
* sör (beer) ➟ sörözik ➟ söröző 
* kávé (coffee) ➟ kávézik ➟ kávézó 
* leves (soup) ➟ levesezik ➟ levesező 
* bor (wine) ➟ borozik ➟ borozó

1jf2q8r,https://i.redd.it/3q8ln854nope1.jpeg,Spider-Man 4 needs to be a Peter Parker story! Here’s what I mean,"This film is something that could be the most personal and human Peter Parker put onto film.

I’d have Pete be so tied into being Spider-Man he neglects Peter Parker. No one remembers him so he feels it’s fine. Peter’s arc is learning that even though the world doesn’t remember him it’s no reason to not be his true self. But also, he needs to learn not to forget his past in order to progress his future. More on that later.

He gets into ESU. He needs a degree because he’s struggling to get jobs without one, especially in New York. Here he meets two people, two people who Pete is nervous of. Harry Osborn and Gwen Stacey. Peter wants nothing to do with Harry because he shares the name of the man who killed his aunt and he is reluctant to talk to Gwen (Sadi Sink’s character) because he knows what happens to Gwen if they fall in love. But, they are all kind to him. Harry lost his mother, so did Gwen. This is the formation of the Coffee Bean Gang.

Picture Harry like Rachel Green from season 1 of Friends. He’s rich but trying to make it on his own, trying to connect with the people. Gwen’s dad is a cop, a good one but certainly has that protective instinct like her father (who doesn’t like Spider-Man).

The villain in this film is Black Cat with Fisk in the background. Hardy is everything Peter wants to be (wrongly). She got rid of her human side to be a vigilante, she doesn’t care who Peter is, only Spider-Man. Peter learns from her what happens if you loose that human connection, if you go fully into being a vigilante you aren’t a hero to yourself.

So, what makes Peter realise he needs to embrace himself and not just Spider-Man. Well, near the end of the film where Peter has seen all sides of this argument he is at a bus stop, an old lady sits next to him. She looks at him, wonder in her eyes and familiarity “Excuse me” she says calmly. Peter looks up. “Are you….Ben Parker’s nephew. I went to school with him, you….you have his eyes”.

Peter realises how wrong he’s been. He’s forgotten Ben, tried to hide that trauma for YEARS and now, Ben is back in his life as the world is forgetting Peter. People are noticing Peter due to Ben’s impact. Peter finally visits his grave to tell him about how he’s been and how sorry he is. He doesn’t go into detail. A blurred image almost, we know the story anyway.

1jf2q67,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1jf2q67/do_i_even_bother_saying_anything_before_removing/,Do I even bother saying anything before removing her from all my socials?,"There's so much context to this but I want to try avoiding writing a novel.

We dated for about 3 months. She was recently out of a 2 year relationship that she ended but she was checked out of for long before that. It started with low expectations, just casual/physical. But it quickly got carried away. We were talking every day, going on tons of romantic dates, holding hands, kissing, staying overnight, exchanging christmas gifts, opening up to me about her childhood trauma, she had even trusted me with the keys to her house to fix something while she was gone. We had great communication. We had discussed while these things are nice, she isn't ready to jump into a new relationship, but we were irresistibly drawn to each other so we were not exclusive and were just trying to enjoy it for what it was. I was keeping my options open, but she was simply better than anyone else I had met recently so I was more focused on her, and she wasn't seeing anyone else.

One week she became distant and then broke things off. We met to talk about it face to face and the thing was she found herself waking up crying every morning thinking about her ex and feeling terrible about dumping him and crazy stressed out about other big life changes she had made at the same time as breaking up with him. She knew it needed to be over and wasn't going back, but part of her missed him and still loved him. It was totally understandable and I supported her decision to give herself time to move on and heal.

Though, the entire pretense of us meeting to talk face to face was that I didn't want us to lose touch entirely. She had said herself we met at a bad time but she valued the connection we had. She offered us to at least be friends but needed time and space away from me. I expressed how the worst outcome is if we lose contact for good, and I want a chance for us to reconnect under better conditions, even if it means we just remain friends.

We had talked about staying in touch and maybe meeting to catch up in a month or so. She had said she's eventually going to come do group activities we used to do together. All in all, I felt pretty good about the breakup. It was sad, but I have some abandonment issues and it's not like she was getting rid of me or didn't care about me. She had genuinely tried to stick it out but realized she couldn't and she couldn't be romantically involved with anyone.

We had limited contact after this. For the most part I left her alone. We'd exchange a few texts a week or every other, but when she was short and it was clear she didn't really want to talk, I'd leave her be. A month later after a brief conversation she seemed more open so the next day I asked if she'd be open to getting coffee. She said she'd think about it and let me know. To calm her nerves, I told her that it doesn't have to go right back to how things were between us, it'd genuinely be nice just to talk and catch up. She just responded she can't think about any of that right now and that it hasn't been that long. So I let it go. She never got back to me about meeting.

2 months after she had broken it off I reached out to her. I expressed that I thought by now we'd have reconnected in some small way at least. That I was trying to not take it personally but it seems like she just has no interest to have me in her life anymore and I'm not sure what to think and I wanted her to tell me what's on her mind. I expressed how it shouldn't have to be this complicated for us to be friends as we have lots of mutual friends and it's not like things ended on bad terms. I then said how I care about her and I'm worried about how she's doing (there were other things she was dealing with other than the breakup) and that I hope all is well.

Her response was... cold. And quite disrespectful. She said all of this was ""too much"", she downplayed allll that time we spent together and how intimate we got, saying all we did was ""hung out for a bit"". She acted like we never talked about staying in touch. She said if she wanted to associate with me like her ""real friends"" then she would have done so. And that when she said we can be friends, she really just meant we can be cordial and friendly if we happen to run into each other somewhere, and that she's getting annoyed and would prefer I don't talk to her at all... really what she said without saying it is that she didn't respect me or care if she hurt my feelings, and she never had any intention of ever seeing me or talking to me again.

This blindsided me. This girl was always caring, considerate of my emotions, clear, direct, and honest with her communication. She was never nasty like that. I have no idea where this came from and it was extremely hurtful to be hit by this after thinking we had ended things on good terms and she was still going to be present in my life somehow.

The last thing I said to her is that her response was unnecessarily harsh, that if I had known that's what she meant by ""friends"" I would have left her alone, and labeling that a friendship is confusing. Then left things off saying I wish things were different and if she wants to talk or see me I'll leave it up to her to reach out.

This was 10 days ago. She did this immediately after she ended things too, but since then she still watches everything I post on instagram, which is weird to me. She seems to have blocked me on whatsapp even though I haven't messaged her, but still has me on IG and hasn't hidden stories from me, so I can see what she's up to. Very strange orbiting behavior.

As a result of some of my social media stalking (I know, I shouldn't) it seems she is sleeping with one or multiple new guys. At the least, she's getting friendly with lots of new guys in her life. Which really draws into question the authenticity of her entire reasoning for breaking things off with me and this whole idea of ""I need time for myself, I only want to spend time with my close friends, and I can't be involved with any guy right now.""

I want to give it a little time before doing anything. It ultimately hasn't been that long and she could come to her senses and apologize any day now. She's shown me that I should probably never be in a relationship with her, but I absolutely hate burning bridges with people. It happens with too many women I've been romantically involved with.

Most likely I'm not going to hear from her, and I should just sever all connections. I feel like I want to say something before I delete her on everything. I don't want it to be misconstrued why it's happening. I want to express how I'm absolutely disappointed by her failure to communicate clearly and keeping my hopes up. How her response to me was cold and it's not true to downplay everything that happened between us like that. How I don't like staying connected on social media with people I'm not on good terms with.

I get why some people say to just say nothing. But I do want to at least plant the seed that the way she handled this was shitty and she should treat people better, as like a duty or courtesy to other people she'll encounter. Sometimes I feel like we enable people by never calling them out on their shit. Sure it'll probably fall on deaf ears immediately, but she might come to terms with it eventually. With the way she still stalks my socials, I have a feeling part of that is because she still does care about me on some level, so being hit with that guilt might get through to her.

I should probably just write her off and have no tolerance for how shitty and uncaring she was, but I'm still a bit sympathetic because I know she's going through a crazy time and she's clearly acting out as a result. I think it's easier for her to absolve herself of the guilt of dumping me and also the guilt of moving on so quickly from her last relationship if she tells herself nothing really happened between us. She's probably now throwing herself at new guys that she can just use as flings with no strings attached to distract herself.

Like I said, she's kind of showing me I dodged a bullet. But I do want to leave the door open for reconciliation. I don't want her thinking that if I remove her from all my socials, she's not welcome to reach out.

I don’t feel much different but I do notice I am not as hungry during the day. I just was wondering when you guys eat? I work a 9-5 and my breakfast is usually just a black coffee with a protein shake as creamer. I usually go on lunch at work anywhere between 11am and 1:30pm. There are many times where for example if I go at 11, I am not hungry yet but if I don’t eat and get hungry later, I am stuck having to wait until 5:30 to eat at home so I eat anyway. Do you guys still eat even if you aren’t hungry? I have the habit of eating when im not hungry anyways, so im having a hard time figuring out whether or not i should eat anyway in fear that i will be hungry throughout my day and won’t have access to a meal until dinner time. Is that just part of the struggle? I mean i have to eat SOMETHING right? Do you still eat even when you don’t want to? I’m worried im still eating the same because i feel like i still need to fuel my body and I won’t see results because of it. Just trying to get insight on this.

The grinder is a La Moustache GrindMaster, small one with different sets of grinding, from 1 to 8 it is marked as the espresso zone and this is the zone I have been moving myself in. I have mostly grind on level 1, the finest. Got quite some channelling, in the first beans I bought more than in the later ones. The first ones seem to have a lighter roast.

I use a botommless filter I bought for the coffee machine, a DeLonghi Dedica with 51mm filters. After grinding it, I fill around 9 grams of coffee in the filter, using a funnel. I then do the WDT and proceed to tamp. Nothing crazy in the tamping, I would say somewhere in the ballpark of 12-15kg I have practiced in the scale.

I then add a puck screen, and still get some channelling. I have adjusted the grinding to be more coarse but no luck there.

Any advice here? Should I definitely get a distributor plus self balanced tamper? I get the impression that that will be adding to the money spent but probably not solving the issue, is it worth? 

Worth to add coffee tastes fine, and some nice crema appears, altho with the channelling is not uniform.

# Navigating Legal and Financial Considerations as a Digital Nomad

As a digital nomad, navigating the legal and financial considerations can be as challenging as finding the perfect spot to work from a beach in Bali. It’s crucial to understand the implications of working across different jurisdictions, managing taxes, and ensuring compliance with local laws. Here’s how you can tackle these issues head-on.

**Understanding Your Legal Status**

To start, determine your legal status in each country you visit. Most countries require a specific visa for remote workers. For instance, some nations offer digital nomad visas, which allow you to live and work there legally. Research the visa requirements of your destination countries and apply well in advance to avoid any last-minute complications. If you plan to stay in one place for an extended period, consider consulting a local lawyer to ensure you’re fully compliant with immigration laws.

* **Digital Nomad Visas:** Countries like Estonia, Portugal, and Barbados offer digital nomad visas, designed specifically for remote workers.
* **General Work Permits:** In countries that don’t offer digital nomad visas, you might need a general work permit or business visa.
* **Residency Requirements:** Some countries may require you to establish residency, which can involve more paperwork and longer processing times.

**Tax Obligations and Compliance**

Managing taxes as a digital nomad is complex due to varying tax laws around the world. Generally, you must pay taxes in your home country and potentially in the countries where you earn income. Understanding your tax obligations is key to avoiding penalties and legal troubles.

* **Home Country Taxes:** Most countries require you to report and pay taxes on your global income. Consult a tax advisor familiar with digital nomad situations to navigate this effectively.
* **Foreign Income Exclusion:** Many countries offer a foreign earned income exclusion, allowing you to exclude a certain amount of your foreign earnings from taxation.
* **Local Tax Obligations:** If you spend significant time in a particular country, you may need to file tax returns there too. Check the tax treaties between your home country and the countries you visit to avoid double taxation.

**Banking and Financial Management**

Choosing the right bank accounts and financial tools is essential for smooth operations. Traditional banks often have limitations when it comes to international transactions. Opt for online banks and fintech solutions that cater to digital nomads.

* **Online Banks:** Consider banks like Revolut, N26, or Wise, which offer multi-currency accounts and easy money transfers.
* **Cryptocurrency:** Using cryptocurrency can simplify cross-border transactions and reduce fees, but be aware of the associated risks and regulatory changes.
* **Virtual Credit Cards:** These can help protect your main account from fraud and unauthorized charges.

**Healthcare and Insurance**

Healthcare coverage is another critical aspect of being a digital nomad. Relying solely on public healthcare systems can be risky, especially in countries with limited resources. Look into comprehensive travel insurance that covers medical emergencies and evacuation.

* **Travel Insurance:** Ensure your policy covers pre-existing conditions, medical evacuation, and hospital stays abroad.
* **Digital Nomad Insurance:** Specialized policies offered by companies like SafetyWing or World Nomads provide extensive coverage tailored for remote workers.
* **Remote Healthcare:** Utilize telemedicine services for quick access to healthcare professionals, especially in remote locations.

**Estate Planning and Legal Documents**

Planning for unforeseen circumstances is vital. Having the right legal documents in place can save you and your loved ones a lot of stress and complications.

* **Power of Attorney:** Appoint someone trustworthy to manage your affairs if you become incapacitated.
* **Living Will:** Document your wishes regarding medical treatment and end-of-life care.
* **Will:** Draft a will to specify how your assets should be distributed after your death.

**Networking and Community Support**

Connecting with other digital nomads and local communities can provide invaluable support and advice. Join online forums, attend meetups, and participate in digital nomad events to build a network that can help you navigate the complexities of life on the road.

* **Online Communities:** Platforms like Reddit, Facebook groups, and Slack channels dedicated to digital nomads can be great resources.
* **Meetups and Events:** Attend local meetups and events to connect with fellow digital nomads and locals.
* **Local Expatriate Groups:** Many cities have expatriate groups that can offer support and guidance.

By addressing these legal and financial considerations, you can enjoy the freedom of being a digital nomad while minimizing the risks and challenges. Remember, preparation is key, so take the time to research and plan ahead to ensure a smooth journey.

# Creating a Strong Online Presence for Remote Job Success

Building a strong online presence is crucial for anyone looking to succeed in remote jobs. Whether you're a digital nomad, freelancer, or part of a distributed team, having a robust online profile can significantly enhance your chances of landing the right opportunities. Here’s how you can create a compelling online presence that stands out in the competitive world of remote work.

**1. Optimize Your LinkedIn Profile**

Your LinkedIn profile is often the first point of contact for potential employers or clients. Make sure it's professional and complete. Include a high-quality headshot, a detailed summary that highlights your skills and experiences, and a list of your achievements. Tailor your profile to reflect the kind of remote job you’re interested in, and don’t forget to add relevant keywords to boost your visibility in searches.

**2. Build a Professional Website or Portfolio**

A personal website or portfolio can serve as a central hub for all your professional information. It allows you to showcase your work in a more comprehensive way than LinkedIn ever could. Include a bio, a list of services you offer, testimonials from previous clients, and samples of your work. Keep it clean, professional, and easy to navigate. Make sure it’s mobile-friendly since many people browse on their phones these days.

**3. Engage on Social Media**

Social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook can be powerful tools for building your brand and connecting with potential employers or clients. Share relevant content, engage with others in your industry, and participate in conversations. Be consistent with your branding across all platforms—use the same profile picture and a consistent bio. This consistency helps build recognition and trust.

**4. Create Quality Content**

Blogging, vlogging, or creating other forms of content can establish you as an authority in your field. Start a blog on topics related to your industry, share your insights, and offer solutions to common problems. Regularly publishing high-quality content can help you attract followers who are interested in what you have to say. This can lead to more job opportunities, collaborations, and even speaking engagements.

**5. Network Actively**

Networking is key in any career, but it’s especially important in the remote work space where face-to-face interactions are limited. Join online communities and forums related to your field. Participate in webinars and virtual conferences. Connect with people through LinkedIn, Twitter, and other platforms. Offer value by sharing your knowledge and expertise, and don’t hesitate to ask for advice or support when you need it.

**6. Utilize Freelance Platforms**

Sites like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer are great places to find remote work opportunities. Set up a detailed profile on these platforms and apply for jobs that match your skills. Make sure your profile is polished and includes a standout cover letter. Don’t just apply for jobs blindly; tailor each application to show why you’re the best fit for the role.

**7. Stay Updated with Industry Trends**

To remain competitive in the remote job market, it’s essential to stay informed about the latest trends and developments in your field. Follow industry leaders, subscribe to relevant newsletters, and read articles and reports. This knowledge can help you position yourself as an expert and can open doors to new opportunities.

**8. Seek Feedback and Improve Continuously**

Ask for feedback from clients, peers, and mentors. Constructive criticism can be invaluable in helping you improve your skills and refine your approach. Take this feedback seriously and make changes accordingly. Continuous improvement shows that you are committed to excellence and willing to grow.

**9. Maintain a Positive Online Reputation**

Your online reputation can make or break your chances of getting hired. Always maintain a professional tone in your communications and be mindful of what you post online. Even casual posts can affect how others perceive you. If you come across negative comments or reviews, address them professionally and constructively.

**10. Leverage Online Tools and Resources**

There are numerous tools available to help you manage your online presence more effectively. Use social media management tools like Buffer or Hootsuite to schedule posts. Employ SEO tools to optimize your website or blog. Consider using CRM software to keep track of your contacts and interactions. These tools can save you time and help you stay organized.

By following these steps, you can create a strong online presence that enhances your chances of success in the remote job market. Remember, building an online presence is an ongoing process. Stay engaged, keep learning, and continually refine your strategy based on what works best for you.

This post falls under Work/Career but Family too. Idk why we're not allowed to put both.

So I turned 18 last year in November and I've been really looking forward to graduate and start working. I used to hate the idea of working, fear the idea of graduating and ""growing up""... But now I look forward to it, I'm overly excited to be done with school and to finally get out there in the world.  
My problems actually been a whole life thing here, since I was a toddler I LOVED drawing and to paint, painting not so much, but I still love both and to draw.  
I'd like to believe I'm a very good artist for my age and I even jokingly call myself ""The Printer"" sometimes because If I use a picture for inspiration or just a base to work off of, I can replicate it almost perfectly just by looking at the picture. (I don't copyright or steal anything, I try to make things my own by just using base ideas. Most of the time I'm drawing mythical creatures or peoples pets that passed away.)  
As much as I love my art and I enjoy drawing, I **NEVER** wanted to make a career out of it and I **NEVER** wanted to even sell my art. The most I do is I just give away some drawings to very certain people, such as my drawings of passed away pets- I'll draw said pet as lifelike and realistic as I can and I will give the picture to the pets owner as a gift, a condolence, and a memorial for their lost companion.  
Even thought I never wanted to make this a job, my mom has always admired my work and says I should sell my work, I should go draw for companies or Tattoo artists, I should become the tattoo artist myself or something. And as much as I appreciate her and her admiration of my work, I just wasn't interested in pursuing any of that or any jobs related. Which, she never liked that I wasn't interested and always tells me I'm ""shooting myself in the foot"" for not wanting to follow my art like that and doesn't understand that I want to keep my work to myself for the joy and creativity of that and the occasions I make someone really happy with a picture.  
This has literally been since I was kid and I started to get really good with my art, to the point my mom started to ask if I was tracing until I sat her down, pulled up a random picture of something and I drew it for her. Ever since, she started with telling me I need to make a career out of this, giving me this disappointed attitude when I didn't want too, and she's even flat out told me she has thought of selling my art behind my back to ""prove me wrong""....Prove me wrong on what? I know it can be somewhat successful and people would probably love my drawings but it's something I wanna keep to myself and she never understands why.  
I've tried to tell her my thoughts of it, how I love my art and I wanna keep it personal but I wanna keep it fun, I don't wanna turn it into a job or chore that I'm gonna burn out of in a year tops and get depressed cause I don't wanna draw anymore.  
I enjoy it more and get the best of my work when it's 3 in the morning on a Friday night, I'm just not tired and I can't stop thinking of this creature I remember seeing in a dream once or a animalistic shaped cloud I saw that afternoon. So I'll sit down and get some of my favorite music playing as I'm drawing and sipping some tea or a Monster Energy drink. THAT is what I love, That is why I enjoy art and just don't wanna make it into a career.. It will stop being meaningful to me and my mom just doesn't understand that and will continue to tell me I'm wrong and that I'm just bringing myself down or again ""shooting myself in the foot"".

Over the years I've honestly started to draw less and less because of this, to the point when I almost don't draw at all anymore.. I'll just sit there and stare blankly at my paper and pencils. Stare blankly at a canvas with no ideas or inspiration, even when I find a passion or surge to draw, I lose it within minutes and now I'm staring a weird little line with nowhere to go.  
Even when I do finally draw something, I end up showing it to no one and I just hide it away like a embarrassing memory because I don't want to hear the same speech on how I need to make a career out of this..  
Regardless I still get that speech.

My mom bought herself a tattoo gun a few years ago and started doing her own tattoos for herself and me sometimes. But any time she brings it out, she'll start telling me I should try being a tattoo artist, that I could and should make/sell drawings for tattoo artists to use. But even then I'm not too interested in that, I like tattoos but I don't wanna be the artist for it, mainly cause it's hard to tattoo the kind of things I draw no matter how simple it might look, My personal style can't be replicated unless I do it myself and that's still hard with tattooing. Plus I'm a bit dramatic with pain, I hate it and I'd be too scared to tattoo anyone cause I'm afraid of hurting them whether I'm trained or not. I get a speech for that choice too..  
And just recently In my life, I started to like coffee. Every once in awhile I'll have a cup or two in the mornings with my dad and its nice, but he and my mom both are big coffee drinkers. As in coffee in the morning, then Starbucks coffee most of the day. (My mom doesn't go that route as much but my dad does every single day)  
This morning as I made a cup of coffee for myself, I was talking about something with my mom and she teased me a bit with ""Oh look at you becoming a big coffee drinker"". (Cause I've hated coffee most of my life till a month or two ago because of my friend)  
I banter back a little with ""Yeah well, I don't have any Monsters so this is the next best option.""  
We talk a little bit after that, I tell her that I'll still never drink Starbucks. (I hate their coffees, I like it more fresh and homebrewed on the stove)  
Then she starts telling me I should try working for Starbucks, be a barista and even jokingly said ""Then we'll get free coffees"". But being a barista was again, never something I was interested in. I struggle already with social anxiety and being communitive with people so that already is a big problem for being a barista.  
I'm slow and clumsy in spaces like that. I get lost easy, confused, misplaced.. I start getting anxious and nervous cause I know I'm messing things up and I feel bad about it. So that's just a place I never wanted to put myself in and for that, my mom scolded me and said ""You can't always be picky about jobs!""  
Picky for two jobs/career paths she's tried to push on me for my whole life, and now one job I'm simply just not interested in? I already have a job I'm interested in and wanna try to work towards, and It's working graveyards (night shifts) at like, a Frys or Walmart. Somewhere I can be productive, get into a simple and easy to manage rhythm. Somewhere I can work in peace and mostly quiet and I'll have a easier time getting around.

How strange is that though? A small content place like Starbucks would freak me out and confused me to hell, yet a store close to the size of a warehouse with over a dozen or more aisle each, would be the easiest place for me to work and get a routine going.  
But that's the job I would love and I'm hoping to get after I graduate, If I can't then I'll gladly look for other available work options. Until then, AIO for being upset at my mom for this? I get that she wants me to have a good life, a good job. But I don't want to be forced in a direction I don't want to take or I'm not comfortable with.. I don't think I'm over reacting or being an asshole but I don't know anymore. What do you guys think? :(",0,1742405603.0,AmIOverreacting,6,0.5,False

1jf2ltd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/1jf2ltd/frustrating_snapchat_situationship/,Frustrating Snapchat Situationship,"Some background: I’ve been a lurker here for a while, and I really appreciate the support and perspective this community offers. I’m hoping to get some advice or just to hear from others who’ve been in a similar situation.

I’m 32 and have never been in a serious relationship. I came out at 20 and have casually dated over the years, but nothing has lasted more than a few months. A pattern has emerged: nearly every guy I’ve dated has gone on to find their long-term partner (or, in two cases, husband) after dumping me. It’s taken a toll on my self-esteem, and it’s something I actively work on in therapy.

Now to the situation at hand. I met a guy (40) on Grindr last spring when he was in town for the weekend. We hooked up and stayed connected on Snapchat. Later, he told me he was in the middle of a separation from his husband and that it had been an abusive relationship. I felt a little weird about it but moved past it since the marriage was already over.

For months, we stayed in touch, mostly chatting and sometimes sending x-rated pics. Then, toward the end of last year, the tone changed—more real conversations, no more explicit exchanges. I took it as a sign that maybe this could be something more. We finally met up again in January when he happened to be in my city for his birthday. He saw me at a restaurant, didn’t say hi, and only mentioned it after I sent him a snap of my food. I asked him to get a drink after my show, but he said he was heading to bed and suggested coffee in the morning. I agreed.

The coffee date went well, and we met up for brunch the following weekend. Afterward, he messaged (again, only on Snapchat), “I’m really enjoying getting to know you. You’re very kind and handsome. I’m still healing from my divorce and don’t want to hurt you. I appreciate your willingness to go slow.” I told him he wasn’t hurting me and that I was happy to move at his pace. He followed me on Instagram. I still didn’t have his number.

We kept talking daily on Snapchat. He took a birthday trip to Mexico while I was on a ski trip, and he was super engaged—sending constant snaps, asking about my trip, liking my Instagram posts. But the fact that our only connection was through social media (especially Snapchat…. Like, I’m in my 30s now) started to bother me.

In February, I asked him to hang out. He said he couldn’t because of work, which was fine, but he didn’t offer to reschedule. That was a red flag for me. Later, I sent him a message: “If you ever want to graduate to texting, here’s my number.” He texted me once, but the conversation was short, and then he never texted again. At that point, I decided to stop initiating. I wasn’t playing a game—I had made it clear I was interested by asking him out, and I felt like the ball was in his court. If he wanted to see me again, he’d have to show some effort.

He continued to snap me daily in March. I took a trip to New York for work, and he was still engaging—liking my posts, asking about my trip, reacting to my stories. But there were still no plans being made. No texts. Just more Snapchat.

Then, this past weekend, I was visiting my brother in another city. He told me he was just chilling at home. In a weak moment, I flirted and said, “Too bad I’m not home this weekend too, we could’ve gone out.” His response? “All good, I needed this weekend to unwind anyway. My next two weekends are crazy busy.” It felt like a preemptive shutdown, like he was making sure I didn’t even ask to see him.

Yesterday was the first day in nearly three months that he didn’t contact me at all. No snap, no Instagram DM, no text. It sucks, but I think this is finally my answer: he’s not interested. And honestly, I think I’ve known that for a while. So frustrated, especially after what he actually vocalized to me the last time we saw each other about wanting to take things slow. I said I was willing to do that, and I meant it. I didn’t say I was willing to move nowhere.

I guess I’m just feeling down about it. Not necessarily because of him, but because it feels like the same thing always happens. I get just enough attention to feel like there’s potential, but never enough to turn into something real. I’m always the “kind” and “handsome” guy. But I deserve better than that. I am worth more than that; therapy is helping me realize it, but it’s a constant battle with myself. And putting myself out there time and time again exposes it.

For those who’ve been through something similar—how do you stop feeling like you’re always the one who’s easy to move on from? How do you remind yourself that you’re not just a placeholder? Would love any advice or insight from people who have navigated this kind of thing. ❤️",1,1742405524.0,AskGaybrosOver30,3,1.0,False

I’ve always had mild heart palpitations throughout my life due to various reasons, even though I don’t have any heart condition. Anything during the day -like drinking one extra coffee, being exposed to loud noises or eating something a little different than usual- can easily trigger my palpitations. Growing up, this problem caused me incredible stress and sometimes (because I couldn’t always identify the exact cause) I mistook it for anxiety when I couldn’t tell the reason. Because of this, all those feelings I get when I start liking someone, the classic “butterflies in the stomach” rush makes me feel like I’ve just been punched in the chest and I’m about to throw up and cry. As much as I love the relatively calm feeling of security that comes later in a committed relationship, I really hate the excitement at the beginning and that makes me unconsciously run away from potential relationships.

Bogotá. Crawling under trucks, hiding in the bellies of ships.”

“Oh, come on.”

“Nay, I swear it. They settled in Bogotá. Then, after the war, their daughter... what was it...

Malarya...”

“Malaria.”

“Aye, malaria took her. She was still but a child. They had no other.”

Dua, rather than muttering some incantation against ill fate, rapped his knuckles twice against

the wooden café table, like a man knocking at the door of something unseen.

“The woman... she was broken. For a time, she did not speak to her husband.”

“And then...” Dua glanced up briefly, just in time to see Latife—balanced upon four delicate

paws—stretching toward his sandwich.

“Latife, here, my girl.” He tore off a piece of cheese and set it before the cat.

Ah, that’s better, Dua.

“Then, the woman said this to her husband: ‘I want a child. Let us adopt.’ The man agreed,

but the woman added, ‘The child shall not be from here. It must be German.’ The man,

seeing no other choice, resolved to go to Germany. And in those days—erm, the Forties,

yes—there were no planes. A ship... ein Monat!”

“A month.”

“To the municipality he went. ‘I wish to adopt,’ he said. But they turned him away. ‘You

cannot,’ they declared. ‘You are not German.’ The man was outraged. ‘How am I not

German?’ he protested. ‘You drove me from my land! I tore my papers to shreds! I am

German!’”

“Documents.”

Özlem, pausing with that particular accent of a Turk raised in Germany, took a moment to

savor the fruity aroma of her Kenyan-brewed coffee. The May sun filtered through the glass

façade of Brew Lab, spilling onto their table. At the same time, Latife, with a flick of her

paw, claimed another piece of cheese from Dua’s fingers.

“So, seeing no other way, he wandered from hospital to hospital. Hoping praying there might

be a mother who did not want her child.”

“Yes, I see how that could happen... I can comprehend it, but I cannot understand it. To not

want your own child...”

“Aye. A cruel truth.”

What is the fuss about? If the whelp is weak, why let it suffer longer? The two-legged ones—

what simple creatures.

“Did he find one?”

“He did. A midwife helped him. Led him to the woman. A beautiful baby boy, she said. One

of those Germans—rosy-cheeked, healthy.”

Now, this I do not understand. Why discard a strong whelp?

“The woman told him, ‘Take him now, or never come back.’ So the man took the child in his

arms and left. Then he crossed into England, in secret. A Jewish friend there helped forge

new documents, and at last, he returned to Bogotá.”

“Now, get to the story.”

“It isn’t finished. They raised the boy, told him he was adopted. But they prepared a box,

locked within it all the truths of his past. ‘When we are gone, you may look inside,’ they told

him. And so, when his parents died, he opened the box. For years, he searched for the mother

who had cast him away. At last, he found her. I tell you, when we lived in Bogotá, our

neighbor, Abraham, he brought his mother to live with him. She was ninety-three by then.”

“Well, well, well... That is a story.”

“Oh, Dua, you do not yet know the half of them.”

You have no stories. Now, Dua, pass me that slice of ham, and I shall take my leave.

Latife lunged toward Dua’s lap. At last, he surrendered the ham to her. Two swift bites, and it

was gone. She leapt from the table, slipping between the maze of café chairs with the liquid

grace of something born in the spaces between this world and the next. A handful of two-

legged creatures reached out to touch her enchanted, no doubt, by the way her long, grey-

white fur shimmered like moonlight on marble. But Latife had taken her fill of affection that

morning from Melek. At the café door, she stopped. She settled back onto her haunches and

fixed her golden eyes upon it, expectant. It would not take long mere seconds before a human

beast noticed. And so it was. The door swung open, and Latife, utterly unbothered, slipped

through without so much as a glance of thanks.

Humans were strange, simple animals. The knowledge of how to wield them, how to make

use of them, had been passed down for thousands of years since the First Great Cat tamed the

hands of men. Each newborn was given this wisdom after their First Trial.

She paused at the edge of the street, watching the metal beasts as they roared past. Useful in

the winter, perhaps, but dangerous. She would have to teach her whelps about them soon.

Then, swift as a shadow, she darted across the road and into Olea Pizza. At once, a battalion

of scents launched an ambush upon her sense’s flavours layered upon flavours, histories and

secrets curling through the air like whispered stories. A human might have smelled only

baked flour, melting cheeses, tomato sauces thick with garlic. But Latife? She smelled

everything.

Latife’s nose knew far more than any human’s ever could. It was not just the warm, twining

scents of baked dough, melting cheese, and thick tomato sauce that filled her senses—it was

the earth in the pots where basil grew by the door, the bead of sweat that slipped from the

nape of the fat man at table three, soaking into his collar, the flour in the proofing box behind

the counter, dusted with the ghostly scent of the sawdust from the storage room where it had

once rested. She smelled Melek’s daughter, Asya, from the morning hug before school. She

smelled old blood, seeping in unseen cracks in the floor from when this pizzeria had been

something else entirely—back in the days when men whispered and drank in the dark, and

not all who entered left with their pockets full. And she smelled the scent of her own legacy,

waiting below.The scent of her six whelps in their wooden box in the basement—where milk

had once been stored, long before her time. A ghost of that scent remained too, hovering like

an old promise. Human noses were pathetic things. They aged, dulled, forgot. But a cat’s?

No, a cat’s senses lived outside of time. And smell was not the only thing untethered to the

present.

“Oi, girl! You back?”

David was a good human animal, but Latife had no patience for chatter. The only

acknowledgment she gave the handsome man—who was nearing his fifties—was a brief,

obligatory rub against one leg. Then she was off, slipping through the pizzeria like a shadow

with purpose.

Olea Pizza was a long rectangle of a place. It ended where a small corridor branched off

toward the toilets, but more importantly, where a staircase led down. And that was where the

world changed. It was a thing about Beyoğlu—every building, every street, every doorway

held something else beneath. The two-legged creatures, for all their arrogance, never quite

grasped that. But the cats? The cats knew. Beyoğlu was not a city, nor even a district. It was a

place built upon places, a thing stacked upon itself like a dreamer’s city, buried and rebuilt,

forgotten and remembered in layers.The cats of Asmalımescit, in their riddle-dreams,

whispered of the foolish two-legged creatures who waltzed upon the bones of the plague-

dead without knowing. They spoke of how the humans danced upon graves, and they

laughed, for nothing was funnier than the ignorance of man. And yet, ignorance was a

necessity. Without it, the cats could not rule them.This was why Latife never wasted breath

warning the humans.

The stone stairs coiled downward, the walls narrowing, the ceiling arching overhead. Bricks

lined the passage, thick and old, red as dried blood. At the bottom, the staircase opened into a

chamber that had seen more than time itself cared to remember. Brick-lined, arched, built into

the belly of the city.For now, it was merely a storage room. But Latife knew the tension in the

air when Melek and David spoke of it. There were plans here. Disagreements. Perhaps it

would one day be something else again. Perhaps it had already been many things before.What

it would become did not concern her.For now, it was the heart of her world.

She strode forward, slipping past old wooden crates and forgotten shelves, and peered into

the box. All six were there. Yellow-White, Slurry, Tabby, Cursed Black, Floppy Tongue and

Long Face. Cursed Black was still sleeping. The others tumbled over one another, trying, it

seemed, to form a single, writhing mass of kitten. Latife stepped into the box, and the chaos

ceased. Five pairs of bright, hungry eyes snapped up at her, and the mewling began. The

scent of milk drew them as if fate itself had tethered them to it. But first, she nudged Kara. A

firm press of her nose to the small belly. A sluggish movement. A tiny paw, barely rising. But

the eyes did not open. Alive. But only just.

The scent—Latife had smelled it for two days now, and it was stronger. With a decisive

movement, she rolled the kitten over. Kara let out a tiny, pitiful cry of protest, a strange

sound. Not like the others. Not entirely of this world. There was something of a shadow upon

Kara, something of a place outside of time. Latife curled against the kittens, stretching just

enough that her belly was exposed. But first, she ensured that the weakest mouth found its

place. At last, the frailest of her children latched onto her, and for a moment, life stirred in its

small body.The others were already locked in their endless war, fighting one another for their

mother’s warmth. As they fed, Latife pondered. Why was Kara so weak?

She thought of their fathers. Four were from Squint Nuri and two were from Colonel. Squint

Nuri was a beast of legend. The undisputed lord of Yeni Çarşı. He dwelled in the abandoned

ruin beside Arkeopera, a relic of a time long past. Unlike many, he had no love for human

animals. He did not accept their food, their affection, their comforts. He lived as his ancestors

had by claw and by tooth, by the way of the hunt and he was strong.

The young males who sought to take his kingdom learned this swiftly. His great head, his

powerful jaws, the way he looked upon the world with sharp and fearless eyes—Well...Eyes

that did not look in the same direction, exactly. Latife had known his strength, and so she had

gone to him, seeking to make her whelps mighty. She had seen his glowing eyes in the dark,

twin orbs of fire that burned in the pitch, but the fire, she had noted, did not align. She had

very nearly laughed. Squint Nuri did not take well to jokes about his eyes. She had held her

tongue.

Afterwards, before walking into the cold night air of Yeni Çarşı, she had stretched long and

slow to keep Nuri’s seed inside of her,

It was there she had seen Colonel. He was young, muscular and sleek. His coat was pale gold

and white, his form filled with the unshaken confidence of something that had never known

hungered had taken him in. He had many strange principles. One of them was this—he never

took his feline companions to be cut. And so, at six months or a year, they left him. They did

not need him. They were strong. Fed. Beautiful. Ehen the city burned with the madness of

March, the young females sought them out. Latife had done as much. Şaşı Nuri’s wild

ferocity had given her four. Colonel’s restless energy had given her two; a bargain. A choice.

When the ache in her belly became too much, Latife pushed the kittens away... Enough.

They had eaten. She licked them, one by one, cleaning the scent of the night from their fur.

Then, she leapt from the box, slipping out of the chamber, up the stairs, past the humans, into

the street. The hunt called. She would feed again. She would grow strong again. Latife did

not eat the garbage that humans called food. Meat. Milk. Nothing else mattered. And meat—

real meat—was best when it ran. She stepped through the streets of Beyoğlu, where a stream

had once flowed before the stone swallowed it, walking toward the water.

Somewhere in the distance, the ferry to Kadıköy wailed. Overhead, gulls screamed. Latife

licked her lips. Tonight, she would find something that bled.

Behind Gülbaba’s shrine stretched a park, a place thick with trees, where shadows curled like

old stories waiting to be told. It was an oddity in Tophane, a remnant of something older,

quieter. The people who lived in the crumbling houses that lined the park’s edges were not

truly of Beyoğlu. They might have existed in some faraway village, some forgotten town

beyond the borders of Istanbul. Latife did not care for these pitiful human beasts. Her gaze

was fixed on something far more important. A pigeon. Perched on the branch of a mulberry

tree, its feathers grey and thick, its throat ringed with white so fine it looked like lace. Latife,

stretching into the silence, realized with deep satisfaction that the bird was sleeping. Tucked

tight, head buried in the down of its own chest, oblivious. She moved. A ghost through the

grass.Her head low, her shoulders tight.A single meter of space between her and her

prey.Nothing at all.She coiled her hind legs beneath her, all her weight balanced in that

single, breathless second.And then, like a storm cracking across the night, she leapt. Her

claws—hidden weapons, gleaming like flick-knives—shot from their sheaths, her open jaws

finding the fragile neck that would soon, soon be exposed.The pigeon saw her at the last

moment but it was too late. Together, they tumbled from the branch, a twisting tangle of fur

and feathers. Two meters. Three.Latife landed first.The pigeon beneath her.Its body writhed,

its wings a frantic blur. Blood was still, thick and hot. It was the ancient one.

Life itself, flowing into her mouth like the sweetest nectar, as though she were drinking from

the great wild soul of the forest. When at last she stepped onto Yeni Çarşı, her belly full, her

pride fuller still, she let a deep, satisfied hum roll from her throat. She considered, for a

moment, playfully purring at the black countess, the fool of a cat still begging before the

kebab shop. But then—The voices; six of them; a shattering of sound, sharp as claws, Five

strong cries and One weaker. It was not from the basement. No it was too clear, too close.

Her contentment vanished and its place to fear. Latife moved. She became anxious. An arrow

loosed from a bow, her limbs coiled with urgency. She tore through the street, slid beneath a

car at the mouth of Nur-u Ziya Sokak, and erupted onto the pavement outside Olea Pizza.

Fools.Fools, all of them.

Melek and David had taken the kittens outside. She saw them at once—hands clad in strange

rubber skins, metal combs in their fingers, picking at the fleas that clung to the whelps’ fur.

As if that [mattered.As](http://mattered.As) if it was of any importance at all. The kittens had not yet passed the

trial. The world was full of predators. Latife lunged forward, pressing her body against their

legs, swiping at their hands, willing them to understand. Put them back. Put them back. Put

them back.But the human beasts only laughed, joked. Other passersby—watching, smiling,

admiring.She was seconds from doing something she was not supposed to do. Seconds from

speaking in words they would understand. And then—A smell.Something awful.Latife turned

sharply, every muscle bristling. A woman.

A human beast, broad in the hips, lumbering forward, a leash dangling from one lazy grip.

And at the end of it—A dog. But not just any dog. A Yorkshire Terrier.Latife’s loathing of

dogs was only outmatched by her hatred of this kind of dog. Its fur was a travesty, long and

matted with the perfume of its owner, the oil of its own filth, the wretched stink of all the

nauseating kisses it had received that day alone. Its breath reeked of bacteria. And worse—It

had noticed her. The little monster’s eyes locked onto Latife.And with that stare, a new scent

joined the air. Fear. Sharp, acidic, like vinegar turning in the bottle. It tried to retreat,

scrambling behind its owner’s legs.

The human—ignorant, oblivious—did not notice.She was too busy navigating the metal

beasts that screamed past on the street. The dog moved closer and closer. It was a mistake. A

fatal one. Latife struck alack blur, struck of fury. She landed on the dog in a tangle of claws

and fangs, her voice a razor-edged wail. The beast yelped. The woman shrieked. The air split

apart. The human, now fully aware, yanked the leash—but Latife’s claws were buried deep in

the creature’s face. So when she pulled—she lifted them both. The woman flailed, and Latife

lashed out, catching flesh.The sickening tear of skin. A scream. Blood—human this time,

staining the street. And then Melek was blocking her with using her foot as a barrier, it was a

mistake, a second one. Latife struck before she could stop herself. Four lines of red bloomed

on Melek’s ankle. David, at last, understood. He swept the kittens into his arms, fled inside.

The world took a breath. The street stilled. The cars crept past, slowing just enough for their

passengers to watch. For a time, the city existed in the moment of the attack. And then, just as

quickly, it forgotten People laughed again. The cars moved on. The world spun forward, but

Latife, she remained for hours guarding the door. Chasing off the other strays, hissing at

passing dogs, large and small, it did not matter. She would allow no more mistakes.Not until

the moon had risen.Not until the air had shifted. Not until the danger had passed.Then, and

only then, did she slip back inside.

Down, down, into the basement. Back to her whelps. They had already forgotten. The five

strong ones—eager, hungry—latched onto her, seeking the new taste in her milk. But Kara—

Kara barely moved. Even when she nudged him toward her belly, even when she pressed him

to the thicker, darker milk that had bloomed in her body after the hunt. The test and the trial

And Kara had failed.

When at last the pizzeria shut its doors, when the ghosts of the city pulled back into their

corners, when night fell over Istanbul, Latife curled around her whelps and closed her eyes.

And then—she opened them. And stepped out of her own skin. Her body—still breathing—

remained curled in the box, her kittens nestled against her warmth. But her soul— her soul

rose. A thing of moonlight and mist, untethered.

She slipped through the walls out of the old pizzeria into Yeni Çarşı. The street was a river of

light.From Tophane, from Kılıç Ali Paşa, from Mimar Sinan Üniversitesi, the cats of Istanbul

poured forth. From Çukurcuma, Faik Paşa, Cihangir, they joined.The bookseller’s plum tree,

the great acacia by Dua’s corner, the very air itself glowed. House cats—locked behind

windows—watched with longing. They were dim things, their light faint, their souls chained.

And all else—the city, the people, the world— was nothing more than a shadow. Latife

moved forward. Toward the meeting place, toward the Great Assembly , to the Great Cat. By

the time Latife arrived, the square was full, as it always was. Every cat in Istanbul was

there.They filled the ground, the balconies, the rooftops, the terraces.They sat perfectly still,

their tails curled neatly around their paws, eyes fixed upon the great iron gates of Galatasaray

Lisesi.

They were waiting.They were always waiting.

The moon bathed them all in silver, turning each of them—no matter how different in color,

size, or shape—into creatures spun from light.

The humans, as always, did not see.

A few passed through the gathering—a shadow here, a whisper there—oblivious, untouched

by the weight of the moment. And then—The moon reached its highest point. And the

Ancient Panther appeared.Not walking.Not emerging.Becoming.

A thing of light and legend, unfolding upon the iron gates, woven from the same silver fire

that burned in the sky.

The murmur of a thousand voices ceased.

No more idle chatter. No more foolish stories of human antics.Only silence.Only listening.

And then—The voice. It did not come from lips, for the Great Cat had no need for lips.

It did not pass through air, for the Great Cat had no need for breath. It simply was.

Spoken directly into their bones, their blood, their marrow. “May the soul of the Forest

Mother and the power of the world never leave you, my beloved kin.”

The gathered cats answered as one.

May it be so!

The Ancient Panther flicked its tail, its body glowing with the light of the moon, its eyes

brighter than any star.

“Before we move to our usual business, I propose we begin with matters of special concern.

All in favor?”

“Mrrr.”

A single unified voice... a decision.

Latife felt a ripple of curiosity. It had been more than twenty years since the Great Cat had

strayed from the standard agenda. Not since the counting of the human animals. Not since

they had last tried to measure their numbers.

The Ancient Panther continued.

You all know our duty, my kin. We watch the human animals. We guard and observe them. In

the days when the Forest Mother first placed them upon this land, the humans were not fools.

They knew of the world’s soul. They could feel the shape of time. They did not need us to

remind them. But as the centuries passed, their blindness grew. And then, in the last hundred

years, they have reached a new illusion. They believe their ignorance has vanished. They

believe they have gained knowledge beyond any in history. They have convinced themselves

they understand the workings of the universe better than ever before.

The Panther’s eyes—bright as burning silver—swept over the gathered throng.

“We know the truth.”

A low murmur rippled through the crowd. Latife felt it a shudder. They had all known this

moment would come. But to hear it from the First Cat’s own tongue? That was something

else. The Ancient Panther raised one massive paw, and the murmur died.

We have done all we can to prevent this moment. We have fulfilled our duty. We have done

more than any should be asked to do.

The voice was not loud. Yet it shook the air.

“The bravest of our kin sacrificed their lineages, allowing themselves to be taken into human

homes, to be cut—”

A hiss, sharp and bitter, ran through the square.

So that they might stay close, whisper what little wisdom they could into human ears. The rest

of us gave up our right to the hunt, to the soil, choosing instead to live in the filth they call a

city. Why? Because we believed they might wake. Because we hoped they might one day open

their eyes. Because we accepted the burden of being their last, fraying thread to the soul of

the world.

A growl rumbled through the crowd with an agreement and anger.

But there is a sickness in them,” the Panther said, “a sickness unlike any the world has

known before. And so, despite all we have done, we have failed in our task.

For a moment, there was silence, a heavy thing... A thing that settled into every furred chest.

Latife could feel the regret. The Ancient Panther regretted the day it had first shown a human

the way to Istanbul. That much was clear.

The latest reports confirm what we all suspected,” the Panther continued. “They have not yet

reached the end of their destruction. The north—where the Forest Mother last draws

breath—has been swallowed by their mechanical beasts. They have buried the trees in stone.

They have torn the roots from the earth. They have smothered the last great home of the wild.

And so, from this moment, the world itself will take over. We all know the truth. The Forest

Mother’s wrath, once stirred, cannot be stopped.

Latife felt her tail bristle. She looked at the ghostly figures of humans passing through the

square, unaware. She thought of their buildings, their streets, their cities. She thought of the

way they never saw it coming. Of the way they never knew they were about to end. She felt

nothing. Not even for the humans she knew.

The Ancient Panther continued.

A pause.

The silence that followed was absolute, and then—The verdict.

“From this day forward, the laws change.”

“First. No healthy kitten shall be domesticated or cut. The ones who have volunteered to be

taken this month—step forward.”

High above, along the top of a crumbling wall, eight hundred and thirty-two spirits flickered

into being.

They had names. They had stories. They had already chosen to surrender their futures. But

they would not. Not anymore.

A roar of mirth rose from the gathered crowd.They were free.

“Second,” the Panther continued, “those of you who have already taken to human homes—

those of you who have longed for the earth, the sky, the hunt—you may leave. There will be

no punishment. There will be no shame. You will not know your own bloodline, but you will

know something better. You will know the wind. The stone. The taste of prey. No longer will

you eat their poisoned food. No longer will you relieve yourselves upon their false earth.”

A mighty cry.Latife could feel it.The yearning.The hunger.

The housecats, locked behind glass, aching to join.

“Third,” the Panther continued, “the rule of silence is broken. You may speak. You may

make them hear.”

A moment of stunned anticipation. It had always been a fantasy.A whisper of what if. And

now? Now it was law.

The words rippled through the gathered cats like a gust of wind in a field of tall grass.

From this moment forth, you may speak to your humans. You may impose your will upon

them. And, given their limited minds, we are certain they will rationalize it in some manner

that does not threaten their fragile ignorance.

Every cat, at some point in their life, had dreamed of this. Had imagined how much simpler

things would be if they could tell the two-legged fools what they wanted instead of waiting

for them to figure it out. Had purred at the thought of it, and now it was real.

The Ancient Panther did not pause. The night was thick with change, and there was one final

matter to settle.

“Fourth and final decree: From this day, every whelp is sacred.”

We shall no longer let the weak perish. There will be no more trials. If a kitten refuses the

milk of the hunt, if they are frail, if they are unfit for the wild, you shall take them to the

humans. Use the third decree. Speak to them. Make them accept their charge. They value

numbers, logic, and their own supposed wisdom—now, at last, we shall use it against them.”

The Ancient Panther lifted its gaze to the moon.

With this, the Great Assembly is ended. May the soul of the Forest Mother and the power of

the world never leave you, my beloved kin.

May it be so!

Latife opened her eyes. The basement was brightening, the first whispers of morning light

stretching through the cracks, spilling across the stone. Yeni Çarşı was waking up. She

breathed in, felt the world settle back into place. The five strong kittens stirred beneath her,

tumbling over one another with eager hunger.

They fed with urgency.And then, full-bellied, they turned their hunger upon one another,

wrestling in the way of those who knew they would live, but Latife turned to Kara. Once,

before the night’s decision, she would have ended him, but now? Now, there was another

path. She listened to his breath—weak, but there. She pressed a few drops of milk into his

mouth, forcing his body to accept life. And then, gently, she lifted him by the scruff of his

neck. She carried him upward, climbing out of the basement, stepping into the golden light of

morning. She leapt onto the counter. She placed Kara down and waited. When David and

Melek entered the shop, their conversation halted at the sight before them. Latife, perched on

the counter and beside her, Kara, weak and silent. At first, they frowned. Annoyance

flickered over their faces. But then—Then they saw her eyes. Latife held their gaze.

And then, slow and deliberate, she pushed Kara toward them with her paw and spoke; not in

words, not in sound not in meaning.

“You will care for him. You will take him to the healer. You will ensure that he lives.”

Melek and David heard it. They did not hear it as speech, nor as some ghostly voice carried

upon the wind. They heard it as if the thought had bloomed within their own minds and for a

long moment, they simply stared. Then— Melek spoke first.

“David,” she said slowly. “We need to take this one to the vet. Look at him.”

David frowned, then nodded. “Yeah. I was just thinking the same thing.”

“If he makes it,” Melek added, glancing down at the tiny, frail kitten, “I guess we have a cat

now.”

David chuckled. “Yeah. Funny—I was just about to say that.What do we call him?”

Melek did not hesitate. “Kara.”

The shop was left in the hands of Seyhan, who arrived just in time to take over. Latife

watched them go. Then—she stretched. Toprak’s grocery had just opened and she was in the

mood for tuna.

With a flick of her tail, she slipped out into the golden light.

The human animals, oblivious to what had just occurred, were stepping into another wasted

day. They had no idea that the Brave Ancient World had already begun its plans for them.

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

An appropriate approach may be a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined the \`gestalts´.",1,1742405366.0,Plato,0,1.0,False

1jf2epk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1jf2epk/treading_the_arranged_marriage_market_since_4_yrs/,Treading the Arranged Marriage market since ~ 4 yrs.,"Disclaimer - This post is an account of what I, as a man, have faced in the AM process. I’m not claiming every woman is the same. There may be some exceptions, but I’m yet to find them. No disrespect to any woman, or womankind.    


I wish I could say I found a partner, but I haven’t. To be honest, I never thought I’d be in such a precarious position. Finding a partner is a far-cry, for months I don’t even have a single woman to converse with, let alone get married.  

When I started this process, I thought maybe I’ll find someone in 6 - 12 months. I’m not looking for something extra-ordinary, perhaps just a woman I can get along with. 

I’m not particular about her caste, community, what profession she practices, how much money she’s making. My family is liberal, so she’ll have the freedom to wear what she prefers, continue living the way she has, and receive support from me in every aspect of our lives. 

But boy oh boy, I have been hit by a whirlwind. Just because I have simple and sane intentions, does not mean I’ll encounter people who have a similar approach. While people today have fancy degrees and fancy jobs, they severely lack EQ, which is crucial to form any kind of lasting relationship.      

Not sure if I’ll ever get married or not, but below is a collection of my finding’s about AM. 

1. Today, people are stuck between the gulf of modernity and traditionalism. We are neither completely modern, nor completely traditional, but choose a particular mindset when it favours us the most. e.g. Women say they are liberal, forward thinking, believe in equality (modern mindset), but will shortlist only those men who are financially well off than them, are of the same community, and with whom their kundali matches (traditional mindset). Claim modernity as it sounds good on paper, but practice traditionalism as it ensures safety and predictability.          
2. Adult, educated women do not have the authority to find their own partners in AM. Majority of women’s profiles are managed by their parents or relatives. A man has to navigate through multiple people to ultimately speak with the woman.  
3. A man’s entire existence and worth after age 25 depends only upon what he does and how much he earns. If you like sports, poetry, music, travelling, etc. it is a good to have, but not as important as how much money you have or make. A woman would happily marry a rich man who has no other interests in life, than an average earning man who has varied interests in life.
4. Men should be prepared to send thousands of requests on matrimonial site and still get no or limited acceptances. From those limited acceptances as well, half of the prospects won’t even respond. Whether you have a premium matrimonial account or a free one, both are equally useless. 
5. In the past, men used to choose women for marriage. Today, women choose men they want to marry. A man should be prepared to face hundreds or rejections. 
6. Few, if any, women contribute financially when you are meeting them for coffee/lunch/dinner. In 4 yrs., I’ve met just 1 girl who paid for our meal. In all other meetings, I have been the one who has always paid. I also met a woman who travelled in her car to meet me, and I had gone on my bike, yet on both the occasions I paid for the coffee (another example of modernity vs. traditionalism mindset as mentioned in point 1). 
7. Many working women do not have time to converse. Men will keep texting them for days and ultimately lose interest. I’ve had working women msg me at 11:15 in the night asking can we discuss now. I mean, lady, do you not have 10 mins to talk in the entire day? Are you so busy that you don’t have time to discuss about your own future?  
8. Dealing with women’s parents is a task. They can’t use matrimonial platforms properly, don’t respond on time, send interests by mistake, and ultimately make the entire process more complex. If a man were to talk directly with the girl first, things would be simple and less time consuming. 
9. I’ve heard some women say that they have to leave their home and come to the man’s house, hence they expect the man to have a handsome salary, grand home, own car, no siblings, preferably parents living separately. In short, provide everything readymade to the woman for her to choose you, all while she would be living in her parents home, traversing an ordinary middle class life, travelling in public transport, and making an average or low salary. 
10. Lastly, today people have no value of time. I’m fine if they don’t value my time, but at least value your own time. Around 60 - 65% of the women I’ve met over the past 4 yrs. are still unmarried, and seeking a suitable partner. Even if I accept that I wasn’t a good fit for them, are you telling me that you couldn’t find one decent man in 4 yrs.? Are today’s educated and working men much worse than the un-educated, or partially educated, men of the previous generations that women can’t seem to like anyone for years?       

I seriously wish men and women wake up from their fantasies. What you see on social media has dwarfed your intelligence, and ruined your world-view. Before you claim what you deserve in a partner, show me what value you bring to the table.

1jf2ege,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jf2ege/my_26m_girlfriend_36f_is_taking_a_step_back_in/,My (26M) girlfriend (36F) is taking a step back in our relationship due to my lack of caring and attentiveness.,"
TLDR, I keep making mistakes in my relationship and it’s making my girlfriend feel like I don’t care about her emotionally, and I am inattentive when she is emotionally vulnerable with me.

Me and my girlfriend have been in a relationship for the last 10 months. I wake up early in the morning everyday to go to the gym, and recently I’ve been having issues waking up to my alarm. This past weekend, I told my girlfriend about my troubles waking up, and she suggested I change the alarm tone because I might just be too desensitized to my current alarm tone. I was focused on cooking at the time and I was unable to retain her suggestion so I never changed it.

Yesterday morning, I yet again slept through my alarm and I was awoke by my girlfriend telling me to turn my alarm off. My alarm was going off and everything, I just never woke up. I’ve never had any frequent issues with my alarm waking her up, with the exception of a few instances every few months. 

We had a long talk yesterday evening about how she made the suggestion to change my alarm tone, and I disregarded her suggestion. She feels like I don’t take her seriously and I don’t care about the effort she puts in to make me a better person. Admittedly, this is not the first time we’ve had this conversation and I find myself disregarding her suggestions and advice from time to time, not from a lack of caring, but because I am a very forgetful person. 

For example, sometimes I put my phone/bowl/cup too close to the edge of the coffee table, which gets on her nerves. She has to remind me of how many times she has told me not to put things too close to the edge of the table. We use an app called Sweepy to manage cleaning of the house, and sometimes I forget to mark off tasks in the app after I complete them. This messes with the point system on the app and makes her upset. I’m just generally a forgetful person and it often gets me in trouble and makes my girlfriend feel like I don’t care.

This morning, I was working on an important project for work and I was in a deep focus. As I was working, my girlfriend got some really crappy news which she expressed to me. I was so focused on my work that I responded with some generic “aww that sucks” “I’m sorry baby” responses, and unsurprisingly my girlfriend felt like I didn’t care about her feelings.

I didn’t even realize she felt that way by my responses until after I was finished with my work nearly an hour later. I don’t even know why I acted that way, inattentive, uncaring, aloof. I am emotionally intelligent enough to know when someone needs some emotional support, but I was so focused on my work I didn’t even pay attention to the way that news affected her emotionally.

Obviously she is hurt, she has told me she is taking an emotional step back in our relationship and cannot emotionally invest in it any further.

I feel absolutely horrible. I love her so much and have never felt the urge to do anything to intentionally hurt her. I am making mistakes, time and time again and I don’t know how to ensure I don’t make these mistakes in the future.

I feel like our relationship is close to becoming irreparably broken by my lack of caring and attentiveness. I genuinely care about her so much, I just don’t know how I can show it to her. She doesn’t care much for romantic gestures or dates, but I would do anything to fix this problem and show her that she is the centerpiece of my world.

You have seen him before, though you cannot recall where. Perhaps in the background of a crowded street, just beyond the edge of your vision. Perhaps seated in a diner, a cup of coffee growing cold before him. Perhaps in the reflection of a window, though when you turned, there was no one there.

He is not remarkable. His clothes are neat but forgettable—always appropriate for the season, but never standing out. His posture is relaxed, his movements unhurried. He does not speak first, but if you address him, he will smile in a way that feels like he has been waiting for you to do so.

No one else seems to notice him. If you point him out, your friends will nod, unbothered, and change the subject. If you ask a shopkeeper if he was just in the store, they will hesitate before answering, as if the memory is slipping away even as they reach for it.

He is always just leaving.

You have passed him on the sidewalk, exiting Jim’s Ice Cream Parlor. You are sure of it. But when you stepped inside, Jim only greeted you as usual, the shop empty except for the two of you.

You once saw him standing in the doorway of the school. The door was ajar, just enough to see the dark beyond, but not enough to see inside. When you blinked, the door was closed.

No one remembers his name. If you ask him, he will tell you something different each time. Something close to familiar, but never quite right.

Sometimes, you think he is following you. Not closely. Not in any obvious way. But there are nights when you catch a glimpse of a figure beneath the glow of a streetlamp, too distant to be sure, and yet unmistakably him.

And sometimes, you think—

You are the one following him.

There is a man.

I didnt and have never yelled, or degrade her, I support her business, and do most of the house chores in addition to working full time.  I run her errands, I bring her coffee.. and I all want is an occasional warm hug and to feel desired. I work out daily, and eat right. I look good and I treat her like a princess!

**10:15 AM** – If your morning was smooth (no drama with family or partner), move forward.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

For context, I'm a restaurant consultant that travels to Japan and Southeast Asia once a year for research and development. 

I'm no stranger to Yoshinoya having lived in Southern California most of my life and after a dinner meeting, one of my japanese partners suggested eat nothing but ""salary man food"" for a few days. 

Its known in Tokyo you can eat to whatever your budget desires. Long story short, I picked out a well known 24 hour chinese restaurant in Shinjuku that I've been told is very popular during lunch because the price is under 900y, and includes a limited buffet. I choose the Dan Dan Noodles, listed 880y. Huge portion, includes tea, coffee, salad, tofu dessert. The server drops my bill and it says 1780y. 

After I ate, I went to the cashier and asked with google translate why the price doesnt match the menu. She gave me a side eyed look and did some adjustments. Surprise! The bill was suddenly 880y.

Don't get me wrong, 1780y is still an incredible deal. But I was definitely targeted because I didn't speak Japanese. So just be careful and ask for the check. Cheers!",4,1742403577.0,TokyoTravel,6,0.61,False

Although the signals are weird, one time she kinda floated the idea of us training together out there, so I said yeah, obviously. I DM'd her saying id be doing x on y day, she replied back saying I'll let you know whether I'm(she) is coming, I ended up going the gym that day, and I see her at the same time but she didn't message me, I purposely tried to not make eye contact since it'd be awkward if she chose to blank me on IG instead of actually not seeing the message/forgetting to reply. I get the feeling she seen me, and chose not to talk to me, although I can't be sure. I DM'd her after that day saying I'd be training whatever on another day.

I see her again another day, we talk she said she didn't see my message, although I just don't buy it, girls are on insta all the time, are they not? Anyway, we were training the same thing by chance and idk we just have like such smooth convo, laughs a lot, asks me if I want to do this exercise after, waits for me to finish whilst shes already done etc. So yeah, weird signals.

Basically, idk how to escalate this( if I even should), I was thinking ask her if she wants to go out to get something to eat or something after gym one day. I could ask if he wants to go for a coffee/drink some time in the gym. I could also DM her, but the fact she apparently didn't see my message that one time, doesn't fill me with confidence, she might actually not check it, although I seriously doubt it, probably blanked me id imagine.

Why You Need to Hold Some CROTCH Right Now!
🍆 The Longer You Hold, The Bigger It Gets! Hold onto your CROTCH, and your rewards come in ETH, CRO, and USDC then multiply every quarter meaning the longer you hold the more rewards you get. If you pull your Crotch out too early, you forfeit your rewards, and they go to those who are still holding for even bigger payouts! Don’t let your weak hands make someone else’s CROTCH fatter!

CROTCH Just Keeps Giving! – Every buy and sell pumps up a charity fund that the community votes on. You’re not just making money, you’re making a difference. You’ll sleep better knowing your CROTCH helped someone in need.
No Flaccid Tokenomics Here! – CROTCH is fully verified, KYC’d, and locked & loaded for multiple CEX listings. Unlike other meme coins that fizzle out, this one is built to last with anti-dump mechanics, a buyback pool, and solid liquidity.

😂 The Name Alone Will Make It Go Viral! – Let’s be real, this is the funniest, most shareable crypto project ever. Whether it’s Twitter, Telegram, or the guys at your office, everyone is going to be talking about CROTCH. And when that happens, prices will explode.

Don’t Be the One Who Pulled Out Too Soon…

PRESALE IS LIVE NOW! Price: $0.003, listing at $0.005. Get in before CROTCH pumps harder than anything you’ve ever held.

You’ll never forgive yourself if you miss this rocket. The only question is… how much CROTCH can you handle?

If you see [PUZZLE] it means the game is a puzzle game! One of my favorite genre's (on the SD). [This number is 'difficulty range' out of 10]

1. [PUZZLE] [5-7] [Isles of Sea and Sky](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1233070/Isles_of_Sea_and_Sky/)

   A beautiful Zelda inspired island hopping block puzzle adventure. You'll power up your character unlocking the ability to solve new block puzzles, hopping around collecting stars, keys, items!

2. [PUZZLE] [5-8] [Paquerette Down the Bunburrows](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1628610/Paquerette_Down_the_Bunburrows/)

   Chase the bunnies! Or... breed the bunnies? A head-scratching puzzler where you must trap bunnies according to their rules! Bunnies behave the way they do, you must learn and adapt! Down the rabbit hole you go.

3. [PUZZLE] [8] [Opus Magnum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/558990/Opus_Magnum/)

   Make a coffee, sit down, clock in. This one is gunna put you to WORK. I consider this game OPTIMAL with a M/KB, however, I think it's navigable at a slower pace on a SD. But the amount of dopamine from sitting down and solving one of these puzzles is among the best. You'll be creating production lines of 'molecule' like structures. They must self-assemble, so you'll be programming nodes and mechanics to construct and submit the final molecular form. If you want more of this, in perhaps a 'harder' format, check out [SpaceChem](https://store.steampowered.com/app/92800/SpaceChem/).

4. [PUZZLE] [3-9] [Snakebird](https://store.steampowered.com/app/357300/Snakebird/)

   Remember playing Snake on your parent's Nokia? Never beat it? Well now you get to replicate that experience! (Am I showing my age?) You'll be moving snakes around with a simple physics based ruleset. Snakes can stack, eat, twist, break! Well... some of these levels are downright hard, BUT there's plenty of levels to beat! 

5. [PUZZLE] [6-9] This is under $10 if you subract $5! [Stephen's Sausage Roll](https://store.steampowered.com/app/353540/Stephens_Sausage_Roll/)

   Yes it's >$10, but to be fair meat prices are so high right now. This is one of my favorite puzzlers, so I had to include it. Stephen has a fork, he needs to fry the sausages evenly, help him out! Flip the sausages, pierce them, move them, twist them, stack them! Very fun.

6. [PUZZLE] [3-10] [FEZ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/224760/FEZ/)

   One of my favorite games ever. Puzzle platformer! It made a big splash on launch, so there's a chance you've heard of this, BUT it's <$10 and if I get one person to check it out, it's worth it. It's an explorative puzzle platformer - the puzzling and platforming is enhanced by a unique 2D -> 3D shifting perspectives, which is a neat mechanic to play around. However, I would like to emphasize there's an aspect of exploration that is the REAL hook. If you fancy yourself a detective, an archaeologist of sorts, you'll be heavily rewarded for investigating the path less trodden. If that intrigues you, this is the one for you.

7. [Pepper Grinder](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2076580/Pepper_Grinder/) 

   A wonderful control scheme, putting a twist on the 'platformer' will make you think ""I'm a pepper grinder!"" But very fun to achieve that flow state and dig and arc through fast paced maps. Plenty of aspirational collectibles will have you replaying levels to perfection.

8. [CHRONO TRIGGER](https://store.steampowered.com/app/613830/CHRONO_TRIGGER/)

   An instant classic (if you're out of $10, get an emulator, no one will judge you). If you consider yourself a true gamer, this is a must play.

9. [Patch Quest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1347970/Patch_Quest/)

   A hybrid bullet hell, RPG, rogelite. With some collectible aspects, and metroidvania-lite map exploration.  Wow that was a mouthful! It's cute, it's bright, it has some fun gameplay decisions. You'll be collecting pets, riding them into battle, collecting fauna and weapon upgrades as you explore an increasingly difficult map. Lots of replayablity as you seek to explore the full map, defeat zone bosses, and upgrade your kit.

10. [Disco Elysium - The Final Cut](https://store.steampowered.com/app/632470/Disco_Elysium__The_Final_Cut/)

   You've probably heard of this... but anyways. You'll be in for a sensory experience with this one! Put your reading glasses on, and get cozy; because this will feel like you got assigned to read 1984 as homework. But we're adults, so it's fun now! Jokes aside, the world building, narration, dialogue, and roleplaying mechanics are the key points here. You'll be challenged to pick a path as you finalize your playthrough's sensibilities. Roleplaying and gameplay outcome become intertwined in this game more than any other before. Your character's stat and point allocation, become the ultimate deciding factor in the many branching dialogue options. There's so much political and social commentary here to ruminate on! It's a very special and finely crafted game.

--------------------

Special mentions for truly patient and well-refined gaming tastes (point and click edition) ;

[The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/32360/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island_Special_Edition/)

   Not your grandparents game! Actually, it very well might be. If you've never played a point-and-click game before, this is the one to try! I think all Valorant players would excel at this, because their accuracy is through the roof, and in order to beat THIS game you have to click on things, on purpose! A hilarious and fun point and click game. The style and atmosphere will stick to your brain like glue.

   If you've read this far, I know you're a true gamer. Only the truly patient would get this far. And you'll need patience (and a pen and paper) to play this one. Another point and click, but far greater emphasis on the puzzling aspects. With a narration that slowly unfolds as you discover more and more of the fantastical island you're mysteriously stuck on.

   Ok, if the Myst looks too dated for you? This one might be for you instead. If you were to take the accumulated knowledge of previous generations, you can culturally become smarter as the technology improves. A fundamental concept to incremental improvement! Well point-and-clicks have been around, but I feel like this one really takes the cake for implementing lessons from previous generations, while finding ways to make it compatible with a modern audience. An impressive feat! Puzzles are organic and unfolding in many layers! You'll be following a mysterious philosophical directive as you explore and unlock an island. Maybe this game will ... change your perspective? (This is a joke, play the game and you'll understand!)",5,1742403126.0,steamdeckhq,3,0.73,False

I enjoy harmonizing and singing all kinds of songs, and I’m just looking for pepole to hang out and sing together

I’ve got a piano at home that I can play and know how to play a bit of guitar too, so if you play an instrument too, that’s awesome but it’s not a must at all :)  It would be great to find a person or multiple ppl who shares this hobby. I’d prefer to meet girlies like me, but honestly, as long as there’s a good vibe, it doesn’t matter aha

We could meet up for a coffee first to get to know each other and then maybe sing at my place or even outside in a park like something chill, no pressure and super fixed plans🧘🏼‍♀️

put that down to it being new so stayed again. Again the service in the bar was so slow you could literally drive your car after because the drink had worn off.

 So then went for a night on the lash (sun night) , when we got back there was no door staff an no way to get the door open, none of the door pads worked... finally got in when another guest seen us an opened the door for us.

Then fast forward to breakfast, of course I know the portions will be small but come on , there is more eating in a MC Donalds breakfast. We then spotted they left coffee with no milk, took ages to get the waitress to come over as she was too busy flaffing round the ones in suits only there for a business breakfast. Asked her for milk and what's the chance of toast too. Came back about ten minutes later with what could be described as warm white bread , then left again for the butter and milk and simply never came back. 

Did mention at the desk on checkout that breakfast was basically shite an they said oh sorry about that. Then got an email saying sorry about the service, I hope you can come stay with us again soon.

Has anyone else had rubbish service here or am I just unlucky(twice)...for the star rating it's nowhere near the same service you get in the Fitz .",4,1742402760.0,northernireland,18,0.63,False

I am not specifically on a diet, but I watch what I eat and try to eat whole foods whenever I can. I make most of my meals from scratch. 

In my relationship, I make most of the meals for my fiance (26F, 5'3, 160 lbs.) and I (24F, 5'6, 205 lbs.). I'll weigh our food before serving just to make sure we are getting the correct portions and I'll pack our lunches for the next day. 

For lunch, dinner, and dessert, we are practically eating the same thing throughout the day. One of the few differences is breakfast. I pack breakfast for my fiance and tea (she likes it with a lot of milk and sugar). While I don't eat breakfast, and will have a black coffee with sweetner sometime before noon. 

My fiance will snack on high calorie items multiple times a day (ex. Cheese, chips, or candy (like Reese's cups) and consumes a lot more sugar on a daily basis than I do. I will typically opt for an apple with PBfit, or carrots with hummus. 

I will substitute a lot of my snacks/meals with the lower calorie options, like subbing Greek yogurt or hummus for mayo on a sandwich, or nonfat Greek yogurt instead of full fat. 

I will go to the gym and do moderate to high intensity workouts 3-4 times a week, am constantly fidgeting, and will walk on my 1hr lunch breaks. While my fiance doesn't go to the gym regularly and instead will opt for the occasional 10 min YouTube yoga video a few times a month. Neither of our jobs are very sedentary. 

My fiance has lost about 10 pounds in about a year; meanwhile, I have stayed the same weight for about 3-4 years now. Throughout those years, I have counted calories, cut calories, and increased physical activity. All of which didn't make much of a difference in weight. 

I build muscle very quickly, but also have a difficult time losing weight. 

Now, I am trying to have a healthier mindset around food and an no longer super strict about calorie couting but and still making consciously healthy/more nutrientious options. 

I am not upset and the comparison isn't to shame myself. I am just interested understanding how different bodies work. Some people can put in a lot of effort and see results, some might not see any, but others are just naturally ""metabolicly gifted?"" lol.. 

What is going on? Any advice or clarity would be much appreciated.

Edit for more context: Not eating breakfast is a recent development. I used to eat breakfast regularly. I was hoping it would help me stay in a calorie deficit, if that was indeed the problem.  ",5,1742402678.0,WeightLossAdvice,19,0.69,False
1jf1g4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1jf1g4q/beginner_roaster_tips_based_in_europe/,Beginner Roaster Tips - Based in Europe,"Hi there, 

Advice needed! I am an avid coffee lover based in Eastern Europe who is set to start his roasting journey. There's plenty of room for development in the coffee roasting business where I am based so that is great news. However, with great room for improvement come other challenges. 

The registration and licensing procedures take quite a while (thanks EU) and finding a good place to register to roast is cumbersome - lots of ventilation and fire safety requirements. 

So I have decided to get a small coffee roaster which I can use at home to get a solid prototype of the product I want to sell. I have a concept that I want to develop and arriving at the final product before kicking off sales will allow me to be confident once I find a space and get a bigger roaster to begin. Most likely I will be looking at a 3-5 kg range (most likely KUBAN) roaster to start with.

In the meantime, I need to roast with a home roaster to get practice and deal with all the registrations. I have some knowledge and very, very basic experience with roasting from the time I lived abroad as I have visited several roasters and participated in amateur one-day trainings. They were done on Probat and Diedrich machines so it will take me a while to reach that level. However, this was more than 5 years ago.

I need your help with the following 2 initial Qs:  
  
1. Select an appropriate home roaster - I don't mind the capacity, everything over 200 g is ok to kick off. Ideally, I don't want to overspend now so I can buy a bigger roaster later. My reseearch show the Gene 101 is very popular and easy to get in the EU. However, it requires connection to a ventialtion system. This may be an issue initially for me at least until I find a bigger space. Is there an alternative to e.g. SR 8000 which doesn't require direct connection to ventilation and is available in the EU? I'm open to any recommendations. It would be great if it can be linked with software such as Artisan so I can get cracking with roasting profiles. Budget - up to 1200 EUR.

2. Green beans -  What would your recommendations be for places to get green beans in the EU. I am looking for an initial 400kg to use for learning and prototyping. Also I'd appreciate any storing advice! 

Thank you ever so much for your help! Keep roasting!",1,1742402668.0,roasting,0,0.67,False

1jf1cgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/goodwill/comments/1jf1cgu/kicked_out_for_putting_things_in_the_wrong_spot/,Kicked out for putting things in the wrong spot??,"Hello, this is kind of a rant but also a question as to if this was normal. For some background, I (19f) shop at my local Goodwill a LOT. Like at least once a week and more. I donate there all the time and genuinely, it’s one of my favorite places to go. 

Yesterday I had this particularly awful experience. I decided to shop around a bit and so I got a coffee and went to goodwill. It was pretty busy but it was senior discount so made sense. Anyways, I had my AirPods in and was just strolling around for the better part of an hour, maybe an hour and a half. I do this a lot, making my way through each aisle then do another lap around the store, then I go to a mirror and decide what I do and don’t want (no fitting rooms). Towards the end, I decided what I wanted to put it back so I was gonna do that. 

As I’m putting shorts back on the shorts rack, a man stops me (manager) and says, “Hey if you don’t want that, just give it to the cashier when you check out and they’ll put it back.” So I kinda nod and was very polite when I said, “Oh this is where I got it from.” He got a pretty nasty tone at that point and said that wasn’t where it goes. I wasn’t gonna fight him, I get it I worked in retail. So I nod and put it back in my cart for when I check out. 

I have my cart full so I decided to lap around once more and then check out. This is when I noticed him follow me around the store. I stop at the men’s tshirts and I’m shooting a text when he comes up to me again. The conversation went like this,

Him: “We are going to be trespassing you from the store.”

Me: “I’m sorry?”

Him: “You are being trespassed and you will not be allowed back in.”

Me: “I’m confused, what did I do?”

Him: “We just need you to leave.”

Me: “I have a cart full of stuff, I was just about to check out?”

Him: “Well you can check out.”

Now, he has another employee escort me to the check out. I’m so confused and shaking cuz I have no idea what I did. I kept asking him what I did and he finally told me I was, “Displaying odd behaviors”. Kinda humiliating. Anyways, so I check out and I leave, and called my mom cuz I didn’t know what to do. We ended up calling the store and he was very defensive, saying my behaviors were odd and I was putting stuff in the wrong spots. Which, I didn’t do that after he told me not to???? He said I wasn’t being accused of stealing, so genuinely I have no idea if I did something wrong, and if this is normal?! The whole situation was so humiliating and made me extremely uncomfortable.

Like this morning I was watching TV with my wife and then all of the sudden I was pouring coffee and completely lost time. My wife said my eyes were glazed and dilated, she couldn’t get my attention and I was just like staring.

But I also have moments where it’s like my brain just hurts. Not a headache, but different. And always after these events I am completely exhausted and mentally drained after.

One of my closest friends had all but vanished after we graduated and drifted off to our respective college and careers. Out of the blue comes a message from him ""Yo I'm in town. Coffee?"" 

I was legit excited. What a blast from the past! We meet at at some fancy south Mumbai cafe, he orders some fancy ass latte phatte with milk from some exotic bean like some sophisticated intellectual (he’s not, I’ve seen him eat maggi with a spoon), and then, with full on intensity he looks me dead in the eye and says, “Listen, you're the third person I'm saying this too -I’m gay.”

Now I consider myself a progressive person but I did choke on my chai tea (ahem) a bit. I quickly recovered and offered an awkward fist bump. He obliged begrudgingly. 

Then, outta NOWHERE, this man hits me with:
""But don’t worry, you’re not my type.""

…Excuse ME?????

NOT YOUR TYPE??

I had been so used to being rejected by girls and here I go being rejected by a guy and I'm not even gay! Who knew my rock bottom would be being rejected by another dude. 

So obviously, I have to ask. I need to know. So I go, “Okay, so what exactly is your type?” Just, you know, for scientific reasons.

And this man—this heartless creature—leans back, sips his overpriced coffee, and says:

""I don’t know, like… bears, bigger guys, beards""

I just sat there nodding. 

And THEN—because he hasn’t already ruined my self-esteem—he pats me on the back and goes, “Don’t feel bad, bro, you’re really funny.”

OH. MY. GOD. Kill me already.

Moved from the Midwest to Boston and I'm currently working a odd overnight job in Andover, Ma. I was watching a old 2016 flatface documentary, and learned Mike is around the Andover area, so I used Google AI to find the bank to block that he skates in the documentary because I wanted to recreate his line. It was only a 1 minute walk from the coffee shop I go to after work in the morning! Didn't even notice it. Unfortunately they removed the bank to block. But I still got a trick.

I've been on Wellbutrin 150mg for a month exactly now, and I didn't notice too much of a difference. I wasn't getting any of the bad side effects like heart racing or hands shaking, and that's with drinking a lot of coffee all the time, too. There was one random day during the month that I felt so extremely happy that it made me want to cry, but it was the only difference I truly felt throughout the entire month. I know the medicine takes a while to kick in properly, but I talked to my psychiatrist about moving to a higher dose, and she put me on 300mg. I took the first one this morning, and I am still hopeful but wary. 

Has anyone who started on 150mg and felt nothing moved to 300mg and felt a proper difference? I have no choice but to get my hopes up because I need to be hopeful about /something/ right now but I guess I just wonder if it will work on me at all. 

Another question-- has anyone experienced stomach pain/nausea on this medicine? I've been getting stomach pain a few hours before dinner, like 3-4pm every day for the past week and it might be unrelated to the medicine.

Cat still not eating. Any advice?","Hi there, my old roommate left their Siamese cat (female, 6 years old) and gave her to me for free two years ago. My cats first doctors appointment was October 2023 for a check up. The doctor said she has slight gingivitis on her right side and gave me this gel. My cat hated the gel so I just started feeding her purina dental life for breakfast every morning. 
I also used to feed her purina one but she stopped eating that one day. I realized that it’s because I kept her bowl full all day and night- then roaches would come at night. So I got that roach problem under control and I don’t keep her bowls filled all day. She eats in the morning around 6:00 am and then again around 5:00pm. I had to switch from purina one to purina indoor cat chow. That was around September 2024.
Also, my cat had fleas from February 2024-March 2024. I noticed her scratching her ears and then saw fleas moving in her fur. I use Advantage 2 large cat flea treatment every month on the nape of her neck.

So now, Tuesday March 11th, 2025 I decided to take my cat to the vet because she had been scratching her ears again. I didn’t see fleas. Her ears had this dark ear wax, looked like coffee grinds. And her scratching has been getting worse over the months and ears more sensitive. Online said it may be mites if she’s scratching it and is sensitive about her ears. The vet on Tuesday said that it looks like maybe a slight infection but nothing big. The vet flushed her ear and then gave her osnuria and we went home. My cats last full meal was Monday March 10th 2025 at night. She ate some of her breakfast before going to the vet on Tuesday. (She usually will eat her breakfast in two half’s. So like once at 6am and then finish it at like 8am. But since we went to the vet, she didn’t finish her other half.)
Anyways after the osnuria, we went home and she hid in the closet and didn’t come out the rest of the day. Then the next day the same thing. She came out asking for her breakfast and I put her dry food. She kept trying to eat it but kept spitting it out. 

On Thursday I noticed the medicine on her ear dropped out and dried almost like hardened plastic or a scab. Especially on her right ear. So I thought maybe since that hardened plastic is close enough to her jaw, it’s pulling her fur while she opens her mouth? Idk. 
I called the vet and they put her in for Saturday March 15th. Up until Saturday she rarely ate her dry food and I resorted to feeding her those squeezable treats. I also tried buying different wet foods but she hated all of them even the mousse (similar consistency to the squeezable churu pouches) She only likes the pouches or wants her dry food which she can’t eat. (Yes I tried crushing it, I also tried soaking it in water, also tried mixing it with the churu and nothing) 

So Saturday March 15th we go to the appointment and the doctor checks her teeth now and sees she has a rotten molar on the right side (same side we saw gingivitis in October 2023)x Since she hasn’t been eating full meals since Monday night, the doctor did an urgent tooth extraction. I took her home that same Saturday. 

Now after the tooth extraction she is still doing the same thing where she wants her dry food or the squeezables and no other wet food that I give to her. I can tell she’s hungry she just can’t chew on fry food right now and she hates the wet food. 
I also give her clavamox twice a day now and gabapentin twice a day. I’m also still supposed to give her ear drops. It was hard getting her in a  blanket burrito and giving all three. 

So on Monday March 17th 2025, I came home from work during lunch to check on her and she just seemed extremely lethargic and she wouldn’t let me go near her right ear. Like her eyes seemed half closed and that morning I could only get the antibiotic in her, not the gabapentin. 
I took her to the vet and they have boarded her since then. The vet also finds it hard to feed her and have also been giving her the squeezable treats as well because that’s all she’ll eat. Now it’s Wednesday march 19th 2025 and same thing. 
The doctor said the father away we are getting from the date of her tooth extraction the less likely her disinterest in the wet food is caused by the extraction or anesthesia. The doctor can’t tell if it’s from the ear?  They tried giving her food stimulant but it didn’t work much. Still just ate the squeezable treat. 

I’m just worried because we had a family cat that had a uti and we didn’t know.  He stopped eating his full meals and his live broke down. Then he passed away. I’m just scared her liver will start breaking down if she doesn’t eat a full meal soon. Any advice on what to do?

## Key Features to Consider Before Buying a Black velvet Accent Chair:

Before diving into our top picks,it's vital to understand the key features that differentiate one black velvet chair from another.

*   **Style and Design:** Do you prefer a modern black velvet chair with clean lines, a contemporary black velvet chair with unique angles, a glam black velvet chair with metallic accents, or a classic tufted black velvet chair? Perhaps a black velvet barrel chair is more your speed? Consider the overall aesthetic of the room and choose a chair that complements it.
*   **Size and Dimensions:** Consider the available space in your room. A small black velvet chair might be ideal for a cozy corner,while a larger black velvet armchair could be a focal point in your living room.
*   **Leg Material and Finish:** the legs play a significant role in the chair's overall style. Options include a black velvet chair with gold legs for a touch of luxury, a black velvet chair with silver legs for a modern look, or a black velvet chair with wood legs for a more conventional feel.
*   **Comfort and Support:** Look for a comfortable black velvet chair with adequate padding and support. Consider features like high-density foam cushioning, a supportive backrest, and comfortable armrests (or the absence of armrests, if that’s your preference). Evaluate if a black velvet chair with arms or a black velvet chair no arms is ideal for you.
*   **Velvet Type:** Different types of velvet offer varying levels of softness,durability,and sheen. Consider options like standard velvet, crushed velvet black chair (for a more textured look), or performance velvet (for enhanced stain resistance).
*   **Tufting Details:** Tufting adds a touch of elegance and visual interest. Options include tufted black velvet chairs with button tufting or channel tufted black velvet chairs with vertical stitch lines.
*   **Price Point:** Black velvet chairs are available in a wide range of price points, from affordable black velvet chairs to high-end black velvet chairs. Determine your budget and choose a chair that offers the best value for your money.*   **Armrests:** If you enjoy leisurely reading, consider purchasing black velvet chair with arms.
*   **Functionality:** The primary function of your chair will narrow the right options. A black velvet office chair or comfortable black velvet chair needs to prioritize comfortable support for long hours on a task or a long day of work.

1jf10zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jf10zw/i_would_appreciate_an_explanation_to_what/,I would appreciate an explanation to what happened to me back then,"Now I hope I will word this in a way that is understandable. I am not the person to exaggerate things or worry about health excessively, maybe sometimes it would be better if I cared more. This might be a longer post. 

(F20, at the time of this I was 19)

Now this happened back in 2023, spanning over October, November but it affected months after that too and I still think about it often, it was one of the most bizarre and surreal experiences I've ever had and some things still don't completely add up.

I was never much of a coffee drinker but I kind of fell in love with it around the end of last September and since then till the beginning of December I started drinking half a litre of black coffee daily. 
Now I will list the symptoms I had experienced in the following months of October till January, at first I did not realise what was up and after I did I quit it completely but all of the symptoms did not stop immediately.

> This one is kind of difficult to explain but it was one of the first ones to come and it wasn't completely unpleasant. I started experiencing sensations with much greater intensity than before. When I listened to someone and focused on what they were saying, every added word to their speech brought an immense satisfaction. Just the act of focusing, of hearing syllables form words and words form sentences. Obviously this confused me because even though I really like to listen to people, it has never brought me this kind of addictive feeling, I started doubting my behaviour past, I started questioning what I was doing wrong before that I never felt so good about these small, simple things. This feeling of gratification did not only come from listening but from other small things mostly connected to short moments of focus.

>Extreme worry. I began to think that something had seriously changed, that I am doing something differently because how else it could be possible that suddenly I have these new feelings that I never had before. I became unhealthily cautious about what other people were saying, I would consciously repeat every word they uttered in my head like this was some kind of a new trick I had learnt, to focus and to understand spoken word. As well as I became ashamed of my past self, I started thinking that perhaps I had not been listening to people prior to this, that's why I did not experience this before. 

>Weird thought patterns. Naturally, I am the kind of a person who is prone to getting stuck in one's thoughts but during this time I had had very weird, convoluted chains of thought I did not even fully understand, these weren't even racing thoughts, it was a whole marathon of back and forths and me overthinking things to the point where they were making no sense at all. I would worry about my 'personality slipping away' or me suddenly not knowing how to act, how to behave.

>Constant fear. It was the worst in the mornings, mildest at night. A lingering, heavy fear of I don't even know what and I did not understand it even back then, I was just permanently afraid, always on the verge of losing my cool, at least that was how it felt.

>Fog. At times the worrying got so excessive I felt distanced from the outer world, literally like there was a fog around me, everything outside of my head did not feel real.

>Physically I was very cold. Again, I have cold hands pretty often, and feel cold more than lots of people around me but then it was even worse.

>My first panic attack. This happened to me the day before my period. I've felt terrible in the morning already, even worse than the other days, this was in October. It was like someone was pushing me ahead when I was walking, once again the world around me felt like it was behind this transparent net, like the walls were made out of something like that, like when you are in a video game and you glitch out, I was worried that would happen. Series of little events (one trip being cancelled, I saw a picture of a flower my father had gifted us the year before he passed away,the weirdest one was me feeling like I am going crazy after I managed to get one answer from mathematics right) pushed me to the point when I had absolutely no idea what the hell I am supposed to do, I just got away from people, sat down and called my mother because I was so desperate. It's a shame not once I measured my blood pressure during these months.

I did not tell anyone about this until February cause I just didn't know how to. After I quit caffeine some of the symptoms had disappeared in the following weeks but the paranoia and anxiety had stayed with me long after.
I also fixed my sleeping habits a hit later, on top of this I had been sleeping for about four hours per night, so I am not sure if that did not contribute to this too.

Honestly I have no idea what had caused a reaction this strong, just half a litre of black coffee, shitty sleep, maybe the coffee made my poor sleep even worse and that made me not process things in a healthy way? The weirdest part for me was the sensory overload but all of it was very unforgettable, it had shaken me quite strongly, I had never felt as helpless as back then and trust me I had been in situations which were not easy before. 

I will appreciate any inputs on this.",1,1742401608.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

My name's Brian from the Netherlands. Currently, I'm working towards a bachelor degree majoring in communication and work a little on the side at a webshop, but that that's boring, so enough about that. I like gaming on my Switch, PC and PlayStation and I do a teeny tiny bit of photography and sketching when I get inspired. The sketching I do both on paper with pencils and digitally using a pen display. I usually also watch sci-fi/fantasy series and movies, and on occasion animated shows (like anime or western animation). I'm very introverted and be a bit shy until I get comfortable talking to you.

I'm looking for someone about my age that is also looking for a serious long term relationship. While I have little to no prior experience with relationships, I do value strong connections and want to build a special and even stronger one. The superficial stuff like what color your hair is or what clothes you wear or whatever aren't deal-breakers for me. Only your personality is all I'm in for! And the rest, we'll figure out as we go! While I'm not against an LDR, I prefer someone who lives nearby (nearby = Netherlands/Belgium/UK/Germany), but it's not an issue if you live farther away. It's not a problem for me if the distance between us is big. Because if the spark is there, then no distance will be too great. Of course, I'm open to just being friends too, but that's if we end up not being compatible as more.

I hope to get to know each other. I'm down to meet up for some coffee, but first let's get to know each other with a nice chat. Talk to you soon!",0,1742401560.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False

Anyways, hello! My name is Cam :) I'm 25 from eastern PA and would love to meet someone new and special! I'm sitting in my car waiting for work to start and listening to Billie Eilish so big vibing.

  
Here's a little about me and what I'm looking for!  


I'm from NY so I have that accent with certain words still, very goal oriented and determined to get to a comfortable spot in my life. Also working on myself so I'm overall happier and more confident! Great progress so far and I'm excited for the future when I can look back and be proud of what I've accomplished.

  
I love coffee. Though this is a dream and I won't be able to do it. I would love to own a cafe and serve the best coffee I can possibly make to people! Every sip flavorful and clearly made with love and passion. But for now I'll stick to my espresso machines at home :)

  
Music is life. I've never been to a concert or anything but I want to! Some of my favorite artists in no particular order are : Billie Eilish, Ed Sheeran, Boywithuke, Dean Lewis and Anson Seabra. The rest are rappers like Kendrick, Logic, Joyner, Eminem.. and the list goes on and on :D

  
420 friendly but I don't really do it anymore it's been over a year.

  
Gamer and nerdy goober. I enjoy my freetime gaming with some friends. Right now I'm playing Minecraft, Elden Ring, Terraria, Valheim, League and Valheim! There are more but those are the main games. I have Dungeons & Dragons on Wednesdays and I'm so so excited to play it! My character is gonna be the goofiest bean I've ever played. I also enjoy making pixelart and painting miniatures I find online! I can show if you're interested but they're not amazing!

  
Personality wise I'm very open and happy. Confident about myself or at least I'm growing more confident each day. Can be a big flirt if the interest and attraction is there. But I love chaos (in moderation) just wanting to have fun talking and making jokes

  
Appearance : I'm 6'1 and have short dark brown hair. I'm noticing little grays in my beard so uh oh. Maybe it'll look good though! I try to keep myself presentable. I'm pretty slim/average weight but I've started working out more actively. Not gym rat levels, just trying to achieve a nice physique that makes me happy :) I also want to get some big tattoos done! 2 custom sleeves and a connecting chest tattoo. Probably more than that as well.

Once contacted the seller on Ebay, he/she said the other item was a ""gift"".

You're not alone. Many people struggle to balance work, home, and personal time. However, there are several effective habits that can help streamline your days and improve your overall well-being. Here are some actionable tips to get you started.

1. Prioritize Your Tasks: Start each day by writing down your top three priorities. This helps you focus on what's most important and prevents you from getting sidetracked by less significant tasks.

2. Time Block Your Schedule: Allocate specific blocks of time for different activities. This method helps maintain focus and creates a structured routine, which can reduce stress and enhance productivity.

3. Practice Mindfulness: Whether through meditation or simple breathing exercises, taking a few minutes to check in with yourself can greatly improve your mental clarity and emotional well-being.

4. Limit Screen Time: It’s easy to get sucked into scrolling through social media or binge-watching shows. Set boundaries for your screen use, and consider scheduling tech-free times to connect with family or engage in hobbies instead.

5. Meal Prep in Advance: Trying to make dinner after a long day can drain your energy. Spend some time on the weekend preparing meals for the week. This not only saves time but also encourages healthier eating habits.

6. Stay Hydrated: It sounds simple, but drinking enough water can have a profound impact on your energy levels and overall health. Keep a water bottle with you as a reminder to stay hydrated throughout the day.

7. Get Moving: You don’t need to hit the gym for hours. Short, regular bursts of activity, such as a 10-minute walk or a quick workout, can significantly boost your mood and energy.

8. Connect with Others: Building and maintaining social connections is crucial for mental health. Make an effort to reach out to friends and family, even if it’s just a quick text or a coffee catch-up.

9. Set Realistic Goals: Break your larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This helps you feel accomplished and keeps you motivated as you check off your progress along the way.

10. Reflect on Your Day: Spend a few minutes each evening reviewing what went well and what could be improved. This reflection can help you develop a growth mindset and foster continual improvement.

With these habits, you're well on your way to a more organized and fulfilling daily life. If you’re interested in tools that can help you implement these changes",1,1742401313.0,EmailOutreach,0,1.0,False

So yeah it is very confusing for me because I don't want anyone to think that I am a creep. So Yeah that is the reason I think I am single and I would like to tell you that I am an introvert but yeah you would have figured out that by now. I just hope that I would get a date but that hope is getting bleak day by day. A bit about me-: I like to watch science fiction movies or TV series. I like to watch and play cricket. I like Marvel and DC both and I like star trek and star wars both so yeah I am weird I guess. I prefer takeaway/order in to go out to eat but yes that can change. I prefer tea to coffee. I like to think of myself as humble and honest but yes some people's opinions may differ. I am a foodie and yeah by that I mean real foodie. I like to listen to '60s, '70s, '80s, the '90s and 2000s Bollywood music and Hollywood rap music. I like to stay at home on a Sunday but yeah that can change. I smoke weed on occasions. I am an average build guy with belly fat and weighing 82 kgs and about 175 cm in height. I have completed my engineering in mechanical if that matters to you. So yeah that is all about me I guess. Now let's talk about what I am looking for. I am looking for a genuine connection. I just want a humble and honest girl. I don't have any other preferences. I like a direct and honest person even if that means criticizing me or telling a blunt truth on my face ( i don't mind). We can exchange pictures if you want or when you are comfortable. So yeah if you read this till the end and find me interesting please do message me in person and even if you don't find me interesting just drop in a message, we don't know what life could have in store for us. We never know what will work and what will not because there are no rules in Nature. So yeah let's try maybe it can be the best decision of our life because we never know. Just so that I know that you have read this till the end start your message with 0963. ",1,1742401113.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

As yoda once said do or do not, there is no try. So here I am finding someone to vibe, have meaningful conversation and we'll see how things goes? 

About myself, my ethnicity is Chinese, 5'2, medium shoulder length hair, wears glasses and definitely active from sports and work. I'm someone who is willing to listen and learn about the other person's interests hence the post. I love to travel and can somewhat attempt to speak 5 languages. I don't have any pets but i do love cats so any cat pictures would be gladly welcomed! Coffee is one of the greatest thing but i do love my milk tea as well. I love taking long walks especially while having someone to talk about life or just to enjoy the weather. 

sometimes the best way to get to know someone is through similar interests and i have a list of categories you can pick to start off a conversation ! I'll be sharing mine through our conversations :)
