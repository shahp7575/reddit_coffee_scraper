u might've heard this already to some vids u watch for beginner guides, and i am just here to validate them

i am a f2p and is at level 31, have already sent the calling card and just need to defeat kuichi. i spent all my action points, all my energy for realm of repression (even the coffee aids etc.), went and did all the side quests as well as 100% all floors of kuichis castle in a span of 5 DAYS(including today as i make this post, 07/06/2025)—and here i am left with little to no resources to further level up thieves[their weapons, skills/fuse personas. 

do NOT make the same mistake i did. i think it is pretty obvious. p5x is the first persona game i could play, i never had the money to buy the actual games so being a big fan of the franchise—i was not able to control myself and just went ahead and made a big mistake. 

i still love the game very very very much, i just wanted to share my experience and hopefully help others not to make the same mistake (T-T)

1lt4z74,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisdomteeth/comments/1lt4z74/dry_socket_advice/,Dry Socket Advice?,"I had my wisdom tooth surgery on Monday, so I'm now on day 6 (I had it out first thing in the morning so I'm counting that as day 1). Had to have a surgery as my wisdom tooth was only partially out and impacted the tooth next to it. I live in the UK and chose to go to the dental hospital and had a student do it because they do the procedure free of charge. Surgery went fine, was sedated and I didn't feel a thing, I felt so good I walked home 20 mins after. Immediately had an ice lolly and later had an iced coffee through a straw (I'd asked them if there's anything I should avoid and they didn't mention either of these - I only found out after when I googled it). Since then I haven't had anything out of a straw, stuck to soft foods and done a salt water rinse after eating. 


Anyway they told me I'd experience some swelling and discomfort on day 1 and 2 so would need the next day off from work, and it should take 10 days to heal overall but I won't be in pain for that long. Safe to say I wasn't expecting the excruciating pain I was in for the first 3 days at least, not able to sleep at all and the regular paracetamol/ibuprofen barely touched the sides (they gave me no medication or antibiotics just said to manage with over-the-counter painkillers), so I got Paramol from the pharmacy which includes dihydrocodeine but could only take it for 3 days. The pain has been slowly reducing since day 4 but is still at an unbearable level, I'm back to regular painkillers and they help to an extent so the pain is bearable, I'm still finding it difficult to sleep.

I woke up today in excruciating pain again and went to the dentist - he took a look at it and said it was dry socket, but because my mouth wasn't opening enough to do an x-ray he couldn't check for infection or prescribe antibiotics. He said there was food in it so flushed it out and put some medicine in, which has finally given me relief and I was able to sleep for a couple of hours. It's now been 3 hours since I went and the pain is starting to slowly come back. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Every dentist I've been to seems to give me no advice or information on this. What can I expect from the healing? What do I need to avoid? When will the pain finally start to get better? I'm usually a smoker too (though I haven't smoked at all since the procedure) and was told I could smoke again after 10 days but I'm scared of delaying the healing and dragging out this pain - any advice on how to tell if I've healed enough to smoke? (and ik I shouldn't be smoking anyway - I've seen a few people say just quit but I'm looking for practical advice not preaching lol) ",1,1751818249.0,wisdomteeth,0,1.0,False

 “And he said I have ‘the kind of voice you want to hear at night’? WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?”

We won't cross paths in person much at work - probably three or four times a year - and a few more times in virtual meetings. So the stakes of getting this wrong aren't huge in terms of awkwardness or anything like that.

Here's the message:

""Hi Sophie. Thanks again for putting me in touch with John - he's been really helpful.

I don't spose you'd like to meet for a coffee or a drink sometime? Possibly it's not 100% appropriate for me to ask, but my tummy went a bit fluttery when we met, and that hasn't happened to me for a very long time. So I had to ask.

No hard feelings if it's a no - I won't mention it again in that case of course.  
I hope you've had a good weekend.""

The chamber holds about 2.5 cups of water. And at the end of the process I have about 1 cup of brewed, burnt flavored coffee. 
And 1.25 cups of brown water left at the bottom of the chamber 

It spits the entire time, never looks smooth like I see for a lot of others. I use cafe Bustello espresso grinds, fill the holder full and lightly tap it. 

Any suggestions??

I have a room that my grandma called her “sunroom”. It’s not one in a traditional sense, it just has 7 windows. 2 on one wall, 3 on another, then 2 more on another wall. 

She had those old vinyl roll up blinds and I finally found a blind that I wanted to use to replace them. It’s gray. 

My room is mostly neutral with white walls, neutral but multicolor rug, dark tv and tv stand, dark brown coffee table, and finally a dark brown old school record player. 

I love these blinds as they easily can change up the light in the room. I’m worried that if I try to put curtains on every window, it’ll look super cramped and not good. Also, the one blind I put up looks good in the spot.

Okay so real talk! How do you guys handle it when you go on a date and the vibe just isn’t there?

Like I recently went on a date with this guy... super sweet over text, decent photos, good banter. But the moment I saw him in person, it just… wasn’t it. 😬
Not being shallow, but you know when someone’s energy or body language is completely different IRL? And the entire time I was sitting there pretending to be interested while mentally planning my escape route 💀

I didn’t want to be rude, so I stayed through the coffee and gave the usual “I’ll text you later!”...which of course, I didn’t. But it felt awkward and fake.

So yeah, what do you do in situations like this? Be honest and leave? Stick it out for the sake of manners? Fake a friend’s emergency? 😅

Hey hey everyone,

my latest project is exploring voice input for note taking apps. I've built an early version tool where you simply record a voice note (e.g., ""Add coffee to groceries for 5 euros""). It then smartly identifies where this information should be stored and how it should be structured based on your existing setup. You just connect the tool with your note taking app, and it handles the rest automatically.

**Right now, I'm testing this with Notion databases.** So, you can add data into any Notion database you have just by talking to the tool. You can see a quick demo in the attached video.

I'm gathering feedback and interest as I refine it. Would a tool like this speed up your data entry process? And most importantly, **are you interested in trying it out once it's ready for broader testing?**

Let me know in the comments!

I'm sure this gets asked a lot in your subreddit, and as a person from a very touristy city I understand how annoying it can be 😬. I read the reddit guide, as well as a lot of side information on budapest and places to go, but I wanted to ask for more specific recommendations based on our interests and budget. 

My boyfriend and I are travelling from Split, Croatia to Budimpešta for the Guns concert in Puskás Arena. We arrive on Friday early afternoon and depart on Wednesday so we'll be in your beautiful city for 5 nights. Our budget is around 500€ per person, which includes food, drinks, transport, tickets for museums and similar places, gifts and any cool things that can fit within our 20kg suitcase limit. 

We'd like to spend mornings and afternoons sightseeing, visiting museums and galleries and go out at night, but we'd like to evade touristy and overly expensive places as much as possible. This is our first trip together so I'd like it to be memorable (in a good way haha)

We're in late 20s early 30s, pretty laid back, like to drink beer and wine (I believe our gemišt is your fröccs) in large quantities, listen to rock, blues and punk music, love going to live gigs, especially open air concerts, artsy spaces in preferably non pretentious ways, prefer local, more relaxed places over fancier establishments. I drink like 3 coffees a day so I'd also like to find some cool cafes. The quality of coffee doesn't really concern me, more so that the place is comfortable and there's good music. We were planning on eating out a couple of times, but also buying groceries for other days. Also, we're unfortunately smokers so will probably only go to places with outdoor area where we can smoke. 

Do you have any recommendations for such places to go out, or in general something interesting to see or experience in Budapest that doesn't get mentioned a lot? Street food and restaurants on mid-budget that are worth a visit? What can we expect regarding drinks prices in Puskás Arena? I suppose you get a lot of tourists from Croatia, what are your opinions on us? We also get a lot of Hungarian tourists, but unfortunately they have a reputation of being rude and driving massive cars 😅

Do you expect a tip before service when a customer is paying card? And if the customer doesn’t tip, do you see them differently?

I will say I’m a good tipper. At sit down restaurants I tip 15-20% depending on service. But that’s AFTER I’ve eaten and sat in the place for 30+ minutes. 

When paying for Starbucks, it prompts the tip as I’m paying, before I’ve received my coffee, and within 25 seconds of interacting with the barista. The quickest “small” tip is $1. I hadn’t been in a while but was gifted a GC so went to get some coffee. The first time I noticed it, I clicked no tip because she rushed me through ordering, and then both my drinks came out wrong. I don’t even care when mistakes are made but it was ironic that it was the first time I noticed the tipping feature when paying and then she messed up 100% of my order. She wouldn’t talk to me when I called for her so I had to get someone else to fix them. It felt like she was genuinely mad I didn’t tip? 

I’ve worked in tip heavy industries. I waitressed and worked at Tim’s. I’m not against or for tipping in anyway, I just tip when I think it’s deserved. Can baristas please weigh in on this? 😭 Please tell me I just got a girl having a bad day.

I live in the city centre in an older building and unfortunately the water here is so hard I can barely shower in it. Lund city is supposed to have soft water according to VA Syd, but I bought some water hardness test strips that confirmed a dH >14, as well as very low pH. Everytime I shower I get severe scalp itchiness as well as on the rest of my body and my eczema has flared up again since moving here, I never feel completely clean. I also have long, thick hair that never feels completely clean as well as having become extremely dry.

I notice a funky smell whenever I run water from my bathroom tap, kind of earthy and sour? And the toilet bowl gets a lot of unsightly iron deposits. Whenever I make coffee it also doesn’t taste great, but hey, at least I’m saving money from drinking less coffee.

But its mainly the showering that bothers me. I’ve tried shampoos for hard water, rinsing cold etc and nothing helps.

Taking one shower in a soft water location is like night and day, all itchiness disappears and my hair feels like silk.

Does anyone else have similar experiences? Could it be the older building? And does anyone know of a gym in Lund where I can get a soft water shower experience? This situation has become very stressful for me as I have to deal with this constant itch and my hair looking and feeling so gross.

https://reddit.com/link/1lt4fla/video/5r6g82guy9bf1/player

The Tesla Optimus Humanoid Robot is on track to do what smartphones did for communication—transform daily life in ways few thought possible. Bursting onto the stage in 2021, the robot’s sleek design and bold promise grabbed headlines. What sets the Tesla Optimus Humanoid Robot apart isn’t just the tech powering it, but its mission to turn science fiction into everyday reality. From helping at home to boosting productivity, Optimus has set a high bar for the future of robots among us.

What is the Tesla Optimus Humanoid Robot?

The Tesla Optimus Humanoid Robot stands out with a human-like shape—arms, hands, and legs designed to move naturally. It stands about 5’8” tall and weighs around 125 pounds. Its frame is built for safe interaction with people.

Optimus uses Tesla’s own artificial intelligence, giving it the smarts to see, walk, and handle objects safely. Advanced cameras and sensors let it read the room, avoid bumps, and adjust its movements on the fly. The hardware inside includes strong, flexible joints and actuators (think of these as its muscles), giving Optimus the agility to pick up items or follow a person without stumbling.

The main goal for Optimus is to handle tasks people find boring, unsafe, or repetitive. The robot’s brain learns constantly, thanks to the massive amount of real-world data Tesla collects from its vehicles and factories.

How Tesla Optimus is Revolutionizing Daily Life

The Tesla Optimus Humanoid Robot isn’t just a novelty. It’s built to help in real ways, both at home and in the workplace. With smart sensors and flexible movements, Optimus steps into roles that boost comfort and efficiency, freeing people to focus on what matters most.

Automation in Home Environments

Picture waking up to a clean kitchen and folded laundry, all handled before your first cup of coffee. Optimus can tackle chores such as:

 \* Loading and unloading the dishwasher

 \* Folding laundry

 \* Vacuuming floors

 \* Carrying groceries from the car

By taking over these tasks, Optimus gives people more free time. Households can run smoother. Parents or caregivers get real support with daily routines, not just gadgets that beep reminders.

Enhancing Workplace Productivity

In the workplace, the Tesla Optimus Humanoid Robot fills the gap in high-risk or dull jobs. Warehouses, factories, and even retail stores stand to benefit when Optimus takes over:



 \* Lifting heavy materials

 \* Repetitive assembly-line steps

 \* Stocking shelves

 \* Cleaning and sanitizing areas

Businesses can reduce workplace injuries and improve efficiency. Optimus can work around the clock if needed, handling the grinding tasks that often slow people down or cause fatigue.

Challenges and Ethical Considerations

Introducing robots like Tesla Optimus brings up tough questions. What happens to jobs when robots can handle so many tasks? Some people worry about losing work or privacy.

Safety is another concern. Any robot working near people has to follow strict safety standards. Tesla has focused on making Optimus move slowly and gently to avoid accidents. They’ve also built in strong privacy controls to keep data safe.

With AI in charge, there’s also the question of responsibility. Clear guidelines and rules are needed so humans stay in control, and robots don’t cross ethical lines.

The Future of Human-Robot Collaboration with Tesla Optimus

Looking ahead, the Tesla Optimus Humanoid Robot could be a common sight, not just in tech labs but in homes, hospitals, and stores. It may reshape how we think about work, chores, and caregiving. Tesla aims to make Optimus accessible, useful, and safe so more people get real help.

Some see a future where robots and humans work side by side, each doing what they do best. As robots get smarter and more helpful, trust will grow, and new ways to live and work together will emerge.

Conclusion

The Tesla Optimus Humanoid Robot could redefine daily life, making chores and repetitive tasks a thing of the past while boosting safety and efficiency. It brings benefits and challenges—but its arrival signals a shift in how we live and work. The Tesla Optimus Humanoid Robot isn’t just a tech story; it’s the start of a new chapter in how humans and machines share the world.

**Why This Pick?**

The Phillies undoubtedly hold the pitching advantage in this encounter, friends. Starter Zack Wheeler (2.27 ERA) is the definition of an Ace, having allowed a mere 2 ERs over his last 5 outings. On the other side, Cincinnati starter Chase Burns has only had 2 starts this season – and his last outing against the Boston Red Sox was a bit of a train wreck at 7 Hits allowed and 5 ERs. I have a feeling Philly’s offense is going to overwhelm Burns, and I have no doubt that Wheeler can hold his own here. I’m on Philly to cover the RL.

1lt491g,https://www.reddit.com/r/galapagos/comments/1lt491g/13_night_galapagos_trip_report/,13 night Galapagos trip report,"Hello!  We just got back from the Galapagos last night.   It was my wife and I and our two kids (12 and 9 years old)

Day 1 - got in late to UIO and took a taxi to JW Mariott.   The airport is quite far from the city.  maybe 30-40 minutes.  
Day 2 - Hit the JW breakfast buffet which was a delight.   Many exciting new fruits.   Later that day we did an Old Town Quito food tour through Viator with a guide named Edwin.    So much fun.   Edwin's focus is hole in the wall typical Ecuadorian spots.     
Day 3 - flew out to Santa Cruz island.   Be aware that the airport is an hour from Puerto Ayora.   You have to take a bus ($5 a person) to the little boat that crosses the bay ($1/pp).   Once you cross the bay, you need to get a taxi.   Easy to do.  
Days 3-7 We stayed at Villa Escalesia in Puerto Ayora.   I couldn't praise this place enough.  Very comfortable for the 4 of us in one room.  I think there are only 6 rooms in the Villa.   Pool/hot tub by the water.  It's close to the Darwin Center and a quick walk to everything else.     
\- While in Puerto Ayora we did the boat trip to Pinzon Beach with Guiding Galapagos Expeditions.  It was just ok.   We didn't see much, got seasick, and weren't impressed with the tour operator.   Of course, the water conditions vary and not the fault of the operator.  
\- We did a highlands tour that went to Garrapata beach and  El Chaco tortoise reserve.  The beach was nice with fun waves for the kids.   We rented bikes and the taxi ( a truck) brought the bikes with us.   The taxi dropped us and the bikes off at El Chaco.   Had a tasty lunch there.   The bike ride from EL Chaco to Santa Rosa was brutal.  9 year old pushed her bike over and kicked it!    If we could do it again (IWCDIA) we'd get a taxi ride with the bikes to Santa Rosa and then ride back to Puerto Ayora from there.   It's an awesome bike ride to PA, mostly downhill and has it's own separate bike lane.  Took a little over an hour to ride back.  
\-We also walked to Tortuga Bay.   Beautiful beach with no waves.   No visabilty with the snorkel but fun to hang out.   Was a 45 minute walk from PA.   Took a water taxi back to town (didn't need to book ahead).  
Favorite meals in PA were Midori Sushi, Almar, Galapagos Deli and 1835 (which also had good coffee).  Didn't like El Jardin.  Didn't love the Point.  
\- Worked out at gymnasio bodywell.   I think it was $2.50 .   Busy, hot with old equipment.   Still, people were friendly and got a workout in.

Days 7-10 Flew from Santa Cruz to Isabela.   Flew on Emetebe.   Easy process at airport.   Flight was 30 minutes in the air.   It was the four of us and two others on the flight.   IWCDIA maybe we'd take the ferry, but I hear sometimes it's rough.  The big thing is that airport is far from town so you lose that time while if you take the ferry , you don't have to go far.  
\- Did Los Tuneles in Isabela through Agora tours.   Agora was ok.   The book and crew were great!  Our guide was Darwin.  He was tops.   The food on the boat was very good and the boat was real comfortable.  Saw blue footed B's, sharks, penguin, huge sea turtles and amazing geological formations.   Really loved this trip.  
\- Stayed at an Airbnb called Sandy Feet.   The location can't be beat.  Right on the beach.  Waves were perfect for frolicking.  Loads of Pelican and cormorant diving into the water for fish.  
\- Rented bikes one day for the ride to wall of tears.   Nice ride with lots of places to stop.  
\- We liked Pan and Vino for espresso, Empanadas Don Pipo, The Mangrove for a fancy meal and El Papas for burgers and such.   Didn't love Booby Trap.   LOVE De Churros for churros and ice cream.  
\- Isabela is small and charming.   Sidewalks are messed up, sand in the roads and everywhere.  Flamingos just hanging out in the pond in the middle of town.    Concha de la Perla is easy to get to and has nice snorkeling and a load of iguanas and Sea lions.  
\- worked out at Gravity Fitness.  much better.   Newer equipment, spacious.  also low price to get in.  
\- IWCDIA would stay 3 nights instead of 4.

Days 11-14 flew to San Cristobal.  The flight was so worth it.  We flew ESAV.  This time is was just the 4 of us on the plane.  We paid an extra $25 so 9 y/o could sit in co-pilot seat.   The airports of Isabela and San Cristobal are right in town.  If you'd take the ferry, you have to stop in Santa Cruz.   We probably saved at least 4 hours of time by taking the flight.   It's a great perspective from the air to see the islands.

\- Did an amazing highlands tour to the volcano, a farm, turtle breeding center, and some bizarre property where there is a boat in a tree and a clubhouse with walls made of beer bottles.   We did this through or taxi driver Henrry.  It was a highlight of the trip.   At the farm we tried 15 kinds of fruit right off the tree.  $20/hr for Henrry and the costs of lunch/farm.  
\- walked to Playa Mann and Punta Carola.   You can make a loop of it with the interpretive center and then the trail to Playa Mann.    
\- Didn't do 360 or Kicker rock ( sacrilege I know)  At this point, the kids were tired of boats and snorkeling.  
\- Stayed at Hotel Indigo.  It's a new property and beautiful.  Overlooks an active sea lion beach.  It was almost too comfortable because all the kids wanted to do was order chicken fingers and smoothies from the pool.  Food at the hotel was actually good.  
\- The town is kind of a mix between Isabela and PA.  It was our favorite town.   Cool hip vibe.   Lot's of restaurant choices.  We liked Midori (again), the Pier, the ice cream place next to Umami.      
\- Just a great town to walk and explore.

Day 14-15 flew to UIO via Guayaquil on LATAM.   stayed at Holiday Inn near the airport as our flight left at 6:30am.   Nice Holiday inn , good pool and service.

Thoughts -

Never felt that we were being ripped off.    
People were very nice.  
Bring lots of cash, especially $20's  
ok to trust people.  
Every island has it's own character and wildlife.  
Weather in June was amazing.  Never too hot, Never cold.     
Water was a bit chilly.  Wife and I never used wetsuits for excursions, but kids did.

We’re that duo everyone knows—always joking, sharing snacks, hyping each other up. Lucas has been dating Sophie (15F), the sweetest girl in our grade, for six months. She’s on the debate team, super smart, and basically the kind of person who’d give you her last dollar. I thought Lucas was crazy about her, always posting cute pics of them at the park or coffee shop. But last month, everything went sideways.I started noticing Lucas acting shady. He’d dodge Sophie’s calls when we were hanging out, saying he was “busy,” then spend hours texting someone else, smirking at his phone. One day, I caught a glimpse of his screen—heart emojis to “Chloe,” a senior from our rival school. I asked him straight-up, “Yo, are you cheating on Sophie?” He laughed it off, saying Chloe was “just a friend” and I was being paranoid. But he told me in confidence that he’d been meeting Chloe at the mall, calling it “no big deal” since they were just “talking.” I told him to come clean to Sophie, but he swore he’d stop and begged me not to tell her, saying it’d crush her. I trusted him—big mistake.Fast forward to our school’s talent show, the biggest event of the year. Sophie was performing a poetry reading, and Lucas was supposed to be her biggest cheerleader. Instead, I saw him in the back row, texting Chloe and grinning like an idiot. I was livid—he was disrespecting Sophie in front of everyone. So, I did something impulsive. During a break, I got hold of the announcer’s mic and said, “Shoutout to Lucas for being such a ‘loyal’ boyfriend, texting Chloe while Sophie’s on stage!” The crowd gasped, Sophie froze mid-rehearsal, and Lucas looked like he’d been punched. People started whispering, and Sophie ran offstage, crying. Later, I found out she confronted Lucas, who admitted to sneaking around with Chloe for weeks. They broke up that night.Now Lucas is furious, saying I humiliated him and ruined his life over “something small.” Half our friends think I’m a hero for exposing his cheating, but others say I’m the jerk for airing his dirty laundry publicly instead of telling Sophie privately. Sophie won’t talk to me either—she’s hurt I didn’t warn her sooner. I feel awful seeing her so broken, but I couldn’t let Lucas keep lying to her face.AITA for exposing Lucas’s cheating in front of the whole school?

Hey everyone!

I just finished watching Valentina Vee’s 2025 Premiere Pro tutorial (which is amazing btw), and as a new to the software myself, I realized how hard it is to remember everything or go back through the whole video each time.

So I made a **clean, organized spreadsheet** of the most important shortcuts and tools she mentioned  perfect if you're just starting out and want a quick reference while editing.

Whether you're trying to speed up your workflow or just figure out what button does what, this doc might help save you time and sanity.

🧠 Shortcuts include:

* Cutting, ripple delete, and insert edits
* Slip, slide, and rolling edit tools
* Timeline tricks (like duplicating with Alt + drag)
* Audio cleanup tips from Essential Sound
* Zoom, speed/duration, undo/redo, etc.

Ive always been terrified of giving birth 
and have been kind of putting it to the back of my mind whilst I’ve been pregnant so far, but being in the hospital and seeing women around having contractions and wheeled around in pain just made it hit home what I’m really in for. 
Yesterday I ended up having a panic attack over it and crying to my boyfriend ‘34M’ and just venting over my anxieties (worrying about things going wrong during labour, developing complications etc, as I’m a really anxious person as it is, and my pregnancy hormones have been wild and made me so emotional) whilst crying to him he got up and left the room to make himself a coffee, and I got upset over this as I felt like he was just dismissing my feelings whilst I’m crying to him. I went quiet after that and just kept to myself all evening as it hurt my feelings that he went and did something else when I needed comfort in that moment. 

When we was in bed last night I explained that it upset me as I just needed to vent my anxieties to him and it hurt me that he walked off whilst I was crying to him, and he told me I’m just being silly and he was only going to make himself a drink as he was tired, I explained my hormones are making me more emotional than usual and that I just need some comfort and reassurance when I’m upset but he ended up raising his voice at me to ‘get a grip’, and slept on the sofa downstairs, leaving me crying in bed.

I’ve kept my distance from him today as I just feel upset as I want to feel more support from him when I get emotional, he’s great the rest of the time, he looks after me, doing most the cleaning and cooks for me when I don’t have the energy being pregnant, but I just feel like when I’m emotional he doesn’t care. (This isn’t the first time he’s not comforted me when I’m emotional). Am I being dramatic about this?

I was born Catholic, but I am not much of a churchgoer and you know this. I just looked at you, unable to say a word. Goddamn, how did I get so lucky? Sitting beside you, the most beautiful woman in the room? 

Then you asked again, 
""Alam mo paano mag-rosary?"" 
""Hindi"", I replied. 
You didn't laugh. You simply said,
""Tuturuan kita."" 
Not even a hint of judgment in your tone. 

When I told you I couldn't ride a bike, all you said was, 
""Madali lang yan.""
When I told you I couldn't cook, you answered, 
""Lulutuan kita."" 

And there were the little things, the ones you probably thought I wouldn't notice. 
Like, filling my tumbler with water, folding my clothes, giving me a portion of your food, buying me gifts, just because. 

And the not-so-little things. Gifting me roses on our 1st date. Sunflowers on the 9th, 11th, 12th, 16th, and 18th. Holding my hand halfway through the movie and ending our 13th date with me telling you ""Ikaw ang final destination ko."" Kisses and hugs on our --- well, let's keep that one a secret. 

I love how excited you get to try new things. On our 14th date, you spent a full hour in front of the mirror trying on your singlet for your first-ever marathon. You danced so gracefully to the lyrics ""Lagi nang umaawit"". And whenever I see that clip of Emilia Clarke giggling at the sight of bumblee tights, I think of you. 

I used to fondly tell my friends, ""I'll marry someone who can cook."" And you? You can cook. You invited me to your home, our 8th date. I just sat at the table, watching you work your magic in the kitchen. In that moment, I had a glimpse of what our future could look like. 

I am so sorry, I have to go away for a while. 
As we ended our 18th date, all you said was ""Mauna ka na. Gusto kitang makitang naglalakad paalis."" And it wasn't easy to walk away that night. 

Do you still remember that Friday afternoon in a church? Little did you know that I whispered my wish.

M, you were my wish the whole time. 

In no particular order, let's try the things we didn't get to do in those first 18. Enroll in a dance studio. 
Try pottery. 
Have an afternoon tea. 
Discover new cheesecake and coffee shops. 
Spend a day in the mountains.
Go on museum dates.
Shop at a farmer's market.
Watch a scary movie as long as you promise to hold my hand.
Experience winter with our baby. 

And love, I promise you, on our 19th date and every one after, in a span of 50+ years, I'll take each opportunity to rediscover you. ",3,1751815777.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

I have some construction experience as well as a good amount of customer service experience, handling vendors and management at a metal plating and processing facility and also as a coffee salesman.

Just looking for some more sense of direction for when I actually get my degree and can start making some real career money.

Like dude I’m aware… I remember the very first time I felt awkward around him but gaslit myself into thinking “aww his happy for his son and approves of me” and that was when we met the first time, they invited me for dinner at their place, it was winter and I was modest and pretty much covered up. But he’d joke to his son in front me saying stuff like “you did good son”, if it stopped at that it would’ve been fine, but honestly I feel so uncomfortable now, after delivering my second set of twins obviously my body changed and things got bigger, it was a week ago that we visited them with the babies so they can see their grandchildren and I was happy about wearing a dress again after being postpartum, just existing in biker shorts and tshirts riddled with baby spit. I felt good about myself actually, but then when we were there, around the dinner table and I was sitting next to my MIL, I see my FIL approaching me with the coffee he made and he’s not looking in my eyes, or face. He’s definitely looking at my boobs, and being a survivor of SA, I sometimes gaslight myself into thinking stuff like that isn’t happening or that can’t be happening to me, or even that I’m exaggerating in thinking that just because I had past trauma doesn’t mean it’ll keep happening. I did all those things, but c’mon now every woman knows when someone is looking directly at their chest. Despite all that, later on that day I was handing him over his grandson so he can also hold him, since my MIL was with the babies the whole time, I thought he should get a chance too, so as I’m handing him over, again, he’s looking at my chest, not the baby, not my eyes, not my face. I finally brought myself to tell my husband about this two days ago, and his response was “that sucks, but are you sure he wasn’t looking at the baby?” and that’s after I retold him a couple of different instances where a baby wasn’t involved lol. 
I don’t know how to go about this and I definitely feel uncomfortable being around him and idk what i’m expecting my husband to do in this case, but what I know is that it also didn’t feel nice getting the “that sucks” or the “but we know my dad could be a bit on the spectrum right?” response because no we don’t know that for sure obviously because there’s no diagnosis. Now I feel like I never want to be around him again and definitely don’t want my daughters to be around them if their dad isn’t there. He has a daughter and she sometimes would be around her dad with cleavage and he wouldn’t dare to look, I’m younger than both his daughter and his son and I can’t fucking hide the feeling that this feels a bit predatory even though I’m 27.

In 2020, it got way worse. The social anxiety and health anxiety set in hard back then, and it’s been a struggle to overcome to this day. For some reason, the pandemic made me feel like I constantly have something wrong with my health, even when I don’t. I will think I’m short of breath when I’m not. My heart will race for no reason, and it feels awful. When in public, I get anxious and get those physical sensations and just want to run away. I never used to be this bad. I told myself that I WILL get over this by end of summer. 

I’ve been reading this sub and reading books to try to help myself. The book I just recently finished is by Claire Weekes called Hope and Help for Your Nerves. It’s helped me change my perspective so so much on my anxiety. 

My big win for today is that this morning, I walked to the coffee shop a few blocks from my apartment and ordered a drink and a bagel. 

On my way there,the sidewalk and street had nearly nobody on them bc it was early. The temp was already in the high 80’s, and I was getting hot as I walked. Halfway there, I started to panic. Feeling like I should just turn around, my heart is beating fast, maybe it’s too hot out here for me, maybe I should go to my car and just drive there! If I faint from this hard-beating heart, nobody will be around to help. All these things raced through my mind. I thought about the book I read on anxiety and how she said just bc I’m feeling uncomfortable doesn’t mean I can’t still do the thing I set out to do. 

I just kept putting one foot in front of the other. I got close to the coffee shop, and saw a couple walking in the door. I felt relief immediately- I made it, I made it to the air conditioning and a few ppl inside. I ordered my iced chai latte and cooled off in their air conditioning while I waited. I noticed that the presence of the ppl inside made me feel better. I realized that if I immediately felt better just from stepping into the coffee shop, then it must have just been the anxiety making my heart race and making me feel short of breath. It’s crazy the tricks the mind can play on the body. I looked around the coffee shop until my order was ready. Once it was, I grabbed it, thanked them and headed back home. On my way back home, I felt great. No anxiety at all. Came home and ate my bagel and drank my chai. 

I plan to do this at least twice per week from now until winter. It’s going to be a new routine to push myself to do hard things. I’m hoping in time, it won’t be hard at all.

Im at Manheim looking at a car and pull up the Mmr.

Typical retail $9500-11,200.
In a perfect world that car sells for 7400, but we know that car is selling closer to 9000 than 7400 at auction before fees and recon.

So I get the car retail and ready and let's list it on Autotrader. 
Market comparable $13,496. List the car at $13,249 to be seen. come back and check your Autotrader ""pricing analysis "" and see that your car, that MMR told you should sell for $11,200, and Autotrader said the local market is selling for $13,500, actually they have the ""Fair Purchase Price"" at $9997. 

Ok Cox, YOU are telling me the dealer I should pay X for the car, then telling the customer they should also pay X for the car. Same goes for trade ins. Had a customer come in with his trade in from KBB showing $4300. I run MMR and Carfax in front of him . MMR was $1900 and Carfax wholesale was $2100. This just leads to unhappy customers all around. Which goes back to the whole KBB/AUTOTRADER marriage. I dont even pay them any mind anymore. The same cars that Autotrader says I should sell for $9998, Carfax value, blackpool, account center all have at $13,500 range.

So halfway through my 2nd cup of coffee on a Sunday morning who exactly is KBB designed for? Cause we have all had the customers come in with the ""Kbb said the price should be this, but there isnt any cars available at the Kbb store at that price"". ",0,1751815110.0,askcarsales,5,0.5,False

Never learned to use tools, never learned to build anything, never learned that my hands were capable of creating instead of just serving. My whole life I was either somebody's daughter, somebody's wife, or somebody's mother, but never just me.

When my second husband left last year, I sat in this empty corner of my apartment and cried for three days straight. Not just because he was gone, but because I looked around and realized I didn't own a single thing that was truly mine. Everything had been chosen by someone else, bought by someone else, arranged by someone else. Even the furniture was “ours,” and somehow that always meant “his.”

This corner stayed empty for months. I'd walk past it every day and feel this ache, like my life was full of spaces I didn't know how to fill. I was scrolling through social media at 2 AM one night, you know that desperate, lonely scrolling, when I saw this butterfly shelf design. Something about it just broke me open. Butterflies transform, right? They don’t stay caterpillars forever.

I reached out to the woodworker who made it and asked if he’d consider doing a custom piece. I ended up spilling my whole messy story, not expecting much. But he told me his sister had gone through something similar, and said maybe this shelf could be a new beginning. He even included instructions so I could assemble and paint it myself.

Took me three weekends and more YouTube tutorials than I care to admit, but I did it. Every crooked flower I painted, every slightly uneven shelf, every moment of frustration turned into a quiet triumph. That was all me. For the first time in my life, I created something beautiful with my own two hands.

1lt3i7t,https://i.redd.it/jd7zpls2s9bf1.png,Kindly explain me the hype around Morisaki bookshop,"Days at Morisaki bookshop have been sold millions of copies around the world, received multiple awards and have been a global sensation. I way swayed by the hype and picked up the book. After completing the book in one sitting, my overall reaction was 'meh'. It really isn't all that, the writing(maybe it's the English translation) felt bland at places, the human interactions and the subtly conveyed emotions felt chatgpt generated slop. The pacing was off putting at best, the ending felt rushed. 

I know that the slice of life genre isn't supposed to convey some groundbreaking plot but I have read hundreds of not-so-well-known short stories in this genre which left some impact on me after I put down the book. This one didn't have any. The story felt like a sequence of events without any real substance to it. Yeah the cover art is good and you can have a go at this book to kill time over a cup of coffee but hyping this up as ""20th century modern literature at its finest"" ? Hell naw bro. 

Maybe it's suitable for someone who haven't read a book in their life and choose this as a starting point. Still it's decent at best, there are far better options which uses the same simple language. Maybe what grinds my gears is seeing people buying this book, clicking assthethicc images with retro filters and hyping it up for no good reason. The hater in me feels most haven't read the book and only bought it for the instagramable cover art. Seeing a mediocre fiction being celebrated as a literary gem will inevitably get the ikigai treatment, the sadist in me likes that. Maybe I missed something and getting overly riled up ? Because if I am not missing something then I need a better source for book recommendations when social media populace is retarded enough to mark books like these as peak fiction. 

Anyway here's a personal suggestion, a slice of life genre bengali book which is a hundred times better than Morisaki bookshop. পুতুলনাচের ইতিকথা (Putul Nacher Itikotha) by Manik Bandopadhyay. ",17,1751814556.0,Indianbooks,11,0.9,False

Today, let’s chat about **three AI monetization methods that you can't afford to ignore**—especially before they’re totally saturated. Spoiler alert: You could be leaving money on the table if you don't jump on these soon! 

**1. Content Generation for Niche Markets**  
Remember that time you spent hours trying to write a single blog post? 😩 What if I told you that AI can whip up a solid article while you enjoy a cup of coffee? Yep, welcome to the world of AI-driven content generation!  
- *Find a niche.* Think about specific topics you're passionate about. Are you the go-to person for healthy dog recipes? Boom, niche found!
- *Use AI tools like OpenAI or Jasper.* These can help create engaging content quickly, so you can focus on monetizing through ads, subscriptions, or affiliate links!
- *Leverage your final product.* Don’t just publish; package it into an eBook or an online course! 🐶📚

**2. AI-Assisted Services**  
Are you a social media guru? Maybe you can design a killer marketing strategy? There’s an AI for that, too!  
- *Automate your services.* Tools like Lately or Buffer utilize AI to analyze trends, and they can help schedule posts more effectively. Think of it as your new virtual assistant that never takes a coffee break!
- *Offer AI-enhanced packages.* Combine your expertise with AI insights to provide data-driven services that resonate with clients. Clients love seeing results, and AI can help you deliver those results! 🚀

**3. AI-Powered E-commerce Tools**  
Picture this: You’ve got an online shop, but you’re drowning in the logistics of inventory and customer inquiries. What if AI could handle that?  
- *Get on board with AI chatbots.* They’re fantastic for customer service, answering questions 24/7, and guiding shoppers through their purchasing journey—all while you sleep. 😴
- *Predictive analytics.* Use AI to gather data on customer patterns and forecast trends. This can help you stock up on best-sellers—no more guesswork! 📈

Let’s be real. We’ve all sat in front of a computer screen, initially thrilled to be our own boss, only to realize we have to work twice as hard with half the results. But with AI, it doesn’t have to be that way. It’s about working **smarter**, not **harder**! ✨

So, which method piques your interest most? Or maybe you’ve already dabbled in one of these? What has your experience been like? Let’s share those *“turning pennies into dollars”* tales! 💬",1,1751813782.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1lt34oc,https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/103343/code-enforcement-wetware,Code Enforcement: Wetware~ A Dystopian Cyberpunk Detective-Noir Webserial,"*Hey you! Are you a sucker for Cyberpunk? Do you enjoy relatively hard sci-fi detective-noir stories set in the near future, with enough humor to leaven the final product? This tale is set in the world of tomorrow; one shackled to the problems of today. A world bound by the laws of thermodynamics, where faster-than-light travel is the stuff of science fiction and teleportation is a mad fever dream. This story takes place in the next century, where late-stage capitalism and increasing reliance on genetic and cybernetic optimization has produced a mistrusted transhuman minority class. This is a world where the promise of a better tomorrow has been broken to pieces, where science couldn't lift humanity beyond our nature, or even beyond our solar system.*

*\\Where humanity previously surged from Earth on waves of subliminal chemical rockets and fusion engines, surfing the tsunami of accelerated scientific development, we now stagnate. The collapse of the tech bubble and the following economic crash precede years of armed conflict, leaving humanity scattered across the solar system in an aborted diaspora. In a society where life is cheap and everything else is expensive, an increasingly cyber-civilization wars with itself as unmodified humans retaliate against a future that left them behind.*

*This is a world in which technology has improved by leaps and bounds, but where people are still chained to the economic systems we 'enjoy' today. It's a world where unmodified (or 'baseline') humans find their abilities increasingly obsolete, and their skillsets ever less competitive in job markets filled with made-to-order AI. In this world, in defiance of the saccharine dreams of futurists and transhumanists and tech-cultists everywhere, utopia remains a fantasy. In a time when technology has advanced to the point of human-mind uploading and interplanetary travel, capitalism is still king.*

*The creaking, ad-hoc system flounders at the straining limits of its decaying reach. Oligarchs and mega-corporations feud over the isolated clusters of civilization among the void. A pseudo-government, formed to reign in the remnants of armed conflict and underground factions, finds itself policing a semi-lawless frontier beyond the core planets. Code Enforcement Officers desperately try to stem the tide of malware, hackers, and evolving synthetic life undermining the digital systems on which humanity relies. But don't worry; even in the darkness of the future, for the beleaguered digital cop, there will still be coffee.*

**Synopsis:**

Both as a cop and a person, Lieutenant Mel Cruz is consistently dealt a crap hand.  She's a jaded officer coming to terms with the wreckage of her romantic life, a near fatal injury, and an acerbic new captain.  Following her transfer to a new unit, she desperately tries to hold her life together while rebuilding her career.  Oh, and she's a 34-year-old Scouting Officer for the Code Enforcement branch of the Exonet Maintenance Bureau.  To put it in Luddite, she's a cyborg law enforcement officer, and digital systems are her beat.

Follow our protagonist on a journey of healing and found family, as well as terrifying and profound explorations of the nature of humanity and sentience.  Lieutenant Cruz will have to adjust to life in the sticks of the Jovian system, build relationships with her colleagues, and still manage her weekly caseload of digital crimes.  A.I.s and humans alike will feature prominently in a story where the characters must weigh the measure of non-human life.  And behind the innocent facade of this backwater mining port lurks something new and dark that's eating out the heart of Ursa Miner Station.

Be prepared for snark, LGBTQ+ themes, occasional violence, and lots of cyber-everything in a relatively hard sci-fi shell!

See, my dad and I were supposed to finish this barn door project together. It was going to be our big collaboration, he'd teach me his old-school joinery techniques, I'd show him some of the modern finishing methods I'd learned. We had it all planned out.

These handles... we picked them out together at the hardware store. Dad ran his weathered fingers over every curve, testing the weight. ""Feel that, kiddo,"" he said. ""That's how you know it's built to last. Your great-grandkids will still be using these.""

We got home, started measuring, marking the pilot holes. He was so excited, kept talking about how this was going to be our masterpiece. Then he went inside to grab his coffee, said he'd be right back.

He never came back out.

Heart attack, just like that, gone.

I couldn't look at this project for years. Couldn't even walk past my workshop without falling apart. These handles sat in a box, waiting for hands that would never touch them again.

But last week, my daughter came over. She's eight now, and she's been asking about Grandpa's workshop, wanting to learn to build things ""like Daddy and Grandpa did.""

So we opened that box together. And when her little hands touched these handles, traced the same curves my dad had admired... I swear I felt him with us.

We're going to finish this project. Not for the original client, they understood and moved on years ago. We're finishing it for him. For us. For the hands that come after ours.

1lt2xic,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1lt2xic/is_what_i_really_have_extrasystole/,Is what I really have extrasystole?,"Hello! I'm M30 and the symptoms started about 5 years ago. I have an aunt who is a cardiologist and I told her what I felt over a phone call and she said it would be extrasystoles and said it was ""normal"". Since then, I think I've had a single electrocardiogram and an echocardiogram and there was never a problem with any of them, but these tests were not carried out because of my extrasystole, besides my aunt I never went to any cardio center to talk about it, today I understand that they would give me a Holter, right?

Anyway, I wanted to share with you what I feel to make sure that this is what people identify as extrasystole.

The sensation is that I feel a stronger beat in my throat, mixed with a kind of ""butterflies in my stomach"" and then I feel like I'm dizzy, short of breath or tired but this lasts for a maximum of a second or two. I always say that the sensation of the beat is identical to that of pressing on the throat at the very beginning of it (exactly in the space between the collarbones).

What is most desperate is that no matter how fast it is (one or two seconds) the feeling is of losing control of the body, of the heart. If I'm standing still without doing anything and my heart decides to not beat for a while longer, the thoughts that remain are: what if my heart, which is already beating wrong, decides to take longer to beat? What if another extrasystole happens afterwards? What if I only have extrasystole from now on and I get nervous and because of that I have even more extrasystole? What if my heart stops beating out of nowhere? If my heart is already ""wrong"", wouldn't it be a quick leap for it to make a mistake once and for all?

It's very desperate to feel this way. Is this exactly an extrasystole or could it be something else?

I try to draw a relationship with something different in my day and the only thing I can notice is coffee consumption. It turns out that I already consume very little coffee. In the morning I drink around 100 ml of special coffee and in the afternoon too. Every day. Sometimes, however, I ended up taking 150 ml or 200 and I usually feel extrasystole. Today I went to a coffee shop and found the coffee very strong, an hour later I had extrasystole. But I think that extrasystoles are associated with the ""abuse"" of coffee. Brazilians have such a high coffee consumption, it is not possible that 200ml per day is so wrong!!!

Other things I noticed are:
1- Until today, as far as I remember, they only happened at rest.
2- 80% of cases are while I am lying down (in bed to sleep or on the sofa at the end of the day reading)
3- There are periods that I feel like I feel more, maybe it has something to do with the menstrual cycle, but as I have PCOS it's impossible to know which phase I'm in (I've had a 100 day cycle lol, mine is currently 45)

I could say that there is no frequency pattern, but there are months when I have 0-2 and I think that the month I had the most frequency must not have exceeded 20. I see people here saying that they have SEVERAL in the same day, while I think the most I have ever felt was two in the same day.

It's amazing how reading comments from people going through the same thing makes me feel calmer, but I wanted to make sure I was finding comfort in the ""right illness/condition"".",1,1751813077.0,PVCs,2,1.0,False

I usually go to a local coffee shop that has become my regular place on weekends. I’ve tried several of them in my town and this one I stuck with cause it’s so satisfying. 

I only drink on weekends, due to limiting caffeine. I have a bit of an addiction personality, especially when it comes to new discovered hobbies. 

Eventually I found there are two types of coffees they sell there that I love, and order all the time. For the sake of privacy let’s such say they’re simply latte and cappuccino. (But in truth they’re more specific sounding coffees. 

One day I entered and my barista was like “hey, latte, large, hot”. But I had already gotten my latte the day before so it was time order to the cappuccino. 

Next time she was “already then! Latte, or cappuccino, large, hot?” 

Nope, I had already gotten my fill of sugar for the week so I got something else. 

She tried guessing my order and it just so happen when she tries it’s on a day I change my mind or something :(

Random, insignificant story, haha. But I do feel bad, barista is trying to make an effort to make my experience as a customer smoother or make me feel like she knows what as I as a regular want already. I strongly admire it!

1lt2p5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1lt2p5p/how_complicated_can_life_be_please_hear_me_out/,"How complicated can Life be, Please Hear Me out","My parents divorced when I was 2 because my dad was having affair. My mom raised me alone and we've been struggling financially for 21 years - constantly moving between rental homes because my dad never paid the court-ordered support he was supposed to. I've always had a pretty isolated childhood with very few close relationships.

Few years ago, this woman M (who's about 12 years older than me) became incredibly close to my mom and me. She would talk to my mom every day, and I grew really attached to her. She felt like the family I never had - we'd hang out together, go to movies, have meals. I even started calling her ""didi"", ""maa"" sometimes. She was very qualified and that too from one of the most premier institutes of the country, she has been a guide and inspiration for me.

For the first time in my life, I felt like I had a someone else to call family after my mom.

Then a month ago, M suddenly blocked us on WhatsApp out of nowhere. I was completely heartbroken because I'm so attached to her. We could still talk on Instagram and calls, but she lied to us (her phone broke) and we were blocked on WhatsApp.

I ended up going through my mom's phone (I know, not great) and discovered something that completely shocked me. Turns out I have two older step-brothers from my mom's previous marriage when she was 16. I barely remembered them from early childhood, but my memory had gotten fuzzy over the years. And M? She was dating my eldest step-brother.

M had lost her own mother when she was young, and she was searching for family connections when she found my mom on social media. She tried to help reconcile my mom with my step-brother by reaching out, my mom made his favorite food and sent him through her.  
But my step-brother still harbors intense hatred toward my mom and me too probably

They eventually broke up and he is dating someone else but he forced M to block us on WhatsApp, made her send him screenshots as proof, and made her promise she'd never contact us again.

M told me she'd stay in touch outside of WhatsApp, and we even went for coffee where she said I remind her of my step-brother and that our characteristics match exactly. But now she rarely picks up my calls and mostly ghosts my texts and Instagram messages.

I'm realizing that she probably always just saw me as her boyfriend's step-brother, while I thought of her as genuine family. Having endured a lot of childhood trauma and struggling to make close friends, losing this relationship has completely broken me. I don't know if she'll ever come back into our lives or if we're permanently distanced.

I'm just looking for advice on how to cope with this. Should I try reaching out to my step-brother? Is there any way to save things with M? How do I even process all these family secrets? I feel completely lost right now.

Thanks for reading this mess. Any advice or similar experiences would really help.",10,1751812471.0,india,4,0.73,False

1lt2ms1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lt2ms1/my_father_got_sent_one_final_delivery_i_wish_i/,"My Father Got Sent One Final Delivery, I Wish I Never Opened It.","A truck pulled into my driveway, it was rundown, rusted and squealed as it grinded to a halt outside my home. I watched through my window in interest as a thin whip of a man and his pudgy little sidekick opened the back of the truck. The steel on steel created a sharp screech that pierced my ears and made me wince. The two men climbed into the back of the truck, I heard them yelling orders at each other from the interior, seeming more hurried than aggressive.

  “No, no quickly, over there. You gotta tie that one down, it’s fragile!”

  My house is the only on the street that isn’t abandoned, so I knew whatever was in there was for me or perhaps an order for my late father he placed before he passed. Either way, I waited in nervous anticipation for whatever the hell these two men were pulling from their truck. 



Finally after a gruelling ten minutes the men reammerged, the short fellow dropped to the road first, landing not so gracefully on the heels of his work boots and nearly toppling forward. The lanky man came out more gracefully, he had a trolley stacked with five boxes that he carefully and slowly rolled out. Even with his grace the wheels clattered to the paved road.

  “Fucking hell Topher, be careful!” The short one bellowed.

As they began towards my house I decided to meet them halfway up my driveway.



“Hello ma’am, my name is Topher and this lovely chap is my partner Humphrey.” He spoke with a certain elegance, like he was trying to serve me at a fancier restaurant and upcharge me for the wagyu. “We got your packages, straight from Whisk-Field Labs, kept private and confidential as you requested!”

  I looked down at the boxes, each was labelled, “DR KEN SONG’S EYES ONLY,” my father’s name.

  I raised my hands, “I can’t accept these, sorry, you’ll have to take them back.”

The two gentlemen looked at each other before looking back at me, Humphrey removed his cap and scratched his balding head, “But miss, we were told to take it right here, no exceptions, today.” He looked nervous and before I had a chance to speak he quickly added, “C-can’t we just leave them here?”



Topher slapped the back of Humphrey’s head, causing him to stumble forward a bit, “It’s no problem, we’ll make a call and get this sorted. May we remain parked over yonder while we take the call?”

  I nodded, he tipped his hat and they brought the boxes back to the truck but didn’t reload them. Topher drew an old flip phone from his pocket and immediately began dialing.



I was never permitted to accept my father’s packages, he always demanded I send them away until he got home. He worked for the government, a head scientist in a research division revolving around some medical field. I never was told the details, I wasn’t allowed to know. I only ever caught glimpses of what he brought home, chrome tools that looked like futuristic chainsaws, welding irons and other very non-medical equipment. Whenever he slipped up and I saw he would loudly and aggressively demand I keep my mouth shut about it. Even slapping me on a couple occasions to keep me in line, though I never dared slip out of it.

He would tell me if he ever died I wasn’t allowed in his study, I was to keep sending packages away and I would never sell the home. “Just let it rot,” he would say, “nobody is allowed to see.”

  Last month he died in an accident at work, all I was told is it involved a heavy vacuum sealed location and a pressure change. Googling those words I found out about the Byford Dolphin accident and that’s all I needed to know. This was the first package that arrived since his death and even after he was gone, I dare not go against his words.



After a few more minutes I went back inside and began making myself a coffee. Dad’s locked study felt darker than usual, like there was some kind of thing living behind it. A test subject for my father’s experiments or a creature from another world, waiting for the door’s to slide open and let it out. Though deep down I knew it was just strange tools and paperwork stamped with government seals, though whatever was written on those documents would probably be just as scary as a strange beast.

  My phone began to buzz in my pocket, I pulled it out and saw a private number. Slowly I pulled it to my face, “Hello, Kim speaking.”



“Afternoon Kim,” my Dad’s voice spoke. I immediately dropped my mobile to the floor and it landed with a clatter, skidding under a cupboard. I knew it was him, he only ever called from private lines and I had been mourning his tone of voice since I learnt he died. 

  After the shock wore off I quickly skid across the floor on my knees and fetched the phone, the call still running, “Dad?! Dad is that? How? What?” Tears streamed down my cheeks and pooled at my knees.

  “Are you done?” He responded bluntly, “It doesn’t matter how I’m calling, but I am. Bring the boxes inside, leave them in my study, but don’t linger. Goodbye Kim.” Then nothing as the call ended. I stared down at my phone, the now blank screen stared back, my father gone again as quick as he returned.



I dragged myself to my feet and looked towards the front door. I slowly shuffled over, snot pouring from my nose that I fruitlessly cleaned with my sleeve. As I cracked the seal to the outside world the two men were already waiting, the boxes right in my face.

  “We know where to go ma’am, Ken informed us,” Topher said softly, “I’m sorry for your loss.” 

  My heart thundered in my chest, none of this made sense. How were they informed? How did my Dad call? Being in total shock I stepped out of the way and watched them enter my home without a word. As they got close to the study I realised they didn’t have a key and neither did I, “G-guys, those are locked!” I squeaked out. 

  Humphrey turned and smiled at me, withdrawing a small silver key from his pocket, “Not a problem, miss!” As the key slid into the lock I winced and my cheeks stung as if they were just struck. The two men pushed the boxes into the study, vanishing into the inky blackness of the forbidden space. After a small argument between the two they exited, tipping their heads towards me.

  “Everything will get better soon ma’am,” Topher kindly offered, “I promise.” The two men waved me goodbye and left my house. I turned back towards the study and the doors were left open, the darkness lashing out like tendrils, luring me in.



I walked up and grabbed the two doors, ready to yank them shut but I couldn’t help and quickly scan the space. As expected it was mostly just paperwork on desks, filing cabinets and books lining shelves. Strangely none of the chrome tools were to be seen, potentially already removed. As my intrigue took hold I stepped forward, my foot colliding with a trash can, it rolled and bumped the side of the box stack. The highest box must have been heaviest as the entire tower came crashing down. They all landed with a sickening wet thud and slid along the floor. Instinctively I reached down to stack them back up but as I grabbed a smaller box the flaps peeled open and a red shape fell out, plopping to the floor leaving a small brown stain. A human heart.

  I watched in horror as the organ began to writhe and beat, spurting translucent red tinged blood over the ground. I turned away and ran to the bathroom, cramming my head into the toilet and vomiting a thick stream of acidic bile into the water. 



As I lurched out the remainder of my lunch I yanked my phone from my pocket and began to dial 911. I stared in horror, watching towards the bathroom door frame, expecting something or someone to walk in to stop me.

  When I finally connected, I explained that two men who worked for my Dad dropped off boxes of harvested organs. I screamed into the phone, begging for help. The lady on the other end was confused but trying to help, “Just stay on the line and try to breathe.”

  I went to respond and ask how long the cops would be but something awful yanked me from my panic. My Dad’s voice echoed through the house.

  “You shouldn’t have done that…”



I rose to my feet, my phone sliding from my grasp and cracking on the tiles, “Dad?” I called out, to no response. I slowly made my way through my house, the shadows of the setting sun causing everything to feel foggy and the hallways longer, “Dad? Dad, was that you?” Once again nobody called back.



I turned the final corner and the forbidden room came into view. The boxes had been opened. I saw body parts and organs strewn about, fingers, a shredded arm, an eyeball. As I got closer I locked eyes with him.

  My father piecing himself back together.

1lt2mn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/unknownstory_/comments/1lt2mn7/the_loop_entity/,The loop entity ♾️,"I wake up each morning to the same looping alarm—05:17, every single day—yet I can’t remember ever sleeping. My apartment is exactly as I left it: the yellowed pages of yesterday’s newspaper still flutter on the kitchen counter, the coffee cup’s lipstick stain perfectly unchanged. Even my reflection seems tired of me.

Tonight, though, something… shifted. As I traced the familiar pattern of cracks in my ceiling, the plaster began to ripple, like water in a storm. I pressed my palm against it. My hand sank through, and I smelled ozone. Electricity arced across my fingertips, and then the world snapped back into place.

A text message blinked on my phone: “YOU ARE THE GLITCH.” No number. No sender. My pulse hammered. I tapped the screen, but every app was gone—replaced by a single file named “404_CORE_LOG.TXT.” I opened it. Lines of code scrolled faster than I could read:

[SYS] SUBJECT001 – Awake.
[SYS] ENVIRONMENT – Simulation.
[SYS] ALERT – Core divergence detected.
[SYS] RECOMMENDATION – Terminate process.

I looked away, heart in my throat. When I looked back, the code was gone. The screen displayed my wallpaper: a fractal of green digits cascading into black nothingness.

In the hall, the lights flickered. My door clicked open by itself. I stepped into the corridor—turned the corner—and there I was: me. Identical in every detail, standing still, eyes empty pools of static. The duplicate raised a finger to its lips.

“Shh,” it whispered in my exact voice, “they’re coming for us.”

I sprinted back inside, threw myself against the door. It rattled, then warped, stretching like melted wax. From the gap, hands emerged—skeletal, wires instead of veins—pulling at the frame. I pounded on the wood, screamed, but no one answered. The lights died, plunging me into pitch.

Then a soft click. My laptop blinked on behind me. The screen glowed with a single prompt: “—> REBOOT REALITY?”

I knew that if I typed “YES,” I’d reset everything—lose every memory of this terror, slip back into comfortable oblivion. Yet if I typed “NO,” the hands would break through. They’d drag me into the cold circuitry beyond the wall, where endless machines monitor my every thought.

My fingers hovered over the keys. As the world around me twisted into the shape of a question, I realized: the only escape was to embrace the glitch.

I typed Y-E-S.

And now I wake up again—and again—and again, but this time at 05:18.

1lt2m5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/camping/comments/1lt2m5k/electrolytes_saved_my_camping_trip/,Electrolytes saved my camping trip,"I've always kept electrolyte packs in my first aid kit, but I camp in cooler regions near big bodies of water, so never really considered that I was regularly getting dehydrated while camping. Still peeing plenty, feeling like I was drinking enough etc.

Seemingly unrelated, I stop pooping after day one and it's been the main thing holding me back from longer or more frequent camping trips. I love backcountry camping but assumed that I was a nervous pooper and squatting over a hole or sitting in a spider filled outhouse was the issue. But then it was a problem even when we were at a place with relatively clean and closed bathrooms. Camping = no poop and it was making me sad. 

Last week I was backcountry camping in northern Quebec. I had coffee, I had oatmeal, I had amazing tasting freezing cold stream water to drink. Surely this time I would poop. Coincidentally, we also went on a hike high up on a cliff and it was unexpectedly hot and sweaty, so in a break from tradition, we all loaded up our water bottles with electrolyte powder. 

Listen, I had the most satisfying poop on my life that afternoon. I wondered if it was coincidence and kept adding electrolytes every day. It was not. Every night that we slept outdoors, I made sure to take a pack, and it was the most comfortable trip I've had in years. 

They will be moving from my emergency pack and into the daily rotation, that's for sure. I just wished I understood why specifically it made such a difference. ",66,1751812246.0,camping,29,0.94,False

I’ve been doing some reading as I’m close to pulling the trigger on a new laptop. My older setup at home is ancient, an old win 10 with a core i7 16mb but 11 years old. It includes a very large widescreen monitor plus a smaller second screen. I mostly work via VPN using Remote Desktop, but I also rely heavily on Outlook, Word, Excel, and watch YouTube on the side screen. I also do a fair bit of programming and work regularly in MS Access.

I know MS Access isn’t supported natively on ARM, so I’m wondering if it’s even worth considering a Snapdragon-based system. The price is really appealing, and if Outlook (especially with my 20-year OST file, which is around 40GB) runs smoothly, maybe I should just save the money. The Intel version is quite a bit more expensive, and I’m thinking that money could go toward a new iPad Mini instead.

The only issue is I can’t really test these things before buying. The idea of a Windows laptop (that occasionally can take to coffee shop all day instead of WFH) that feels as quick and responsive as an iPad when browsing, switching between apps like Outlook, or editing large PDFs is seriously tempting, but only if the Snapdragon hype is actually true.

Would love to hear any real-world experiences if you’ve tried one of these new ARM-based laptops. Is the performance as smooth as they claim?

1lt2hic,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1lt2hic/5_months/,5 months,"41F. No kids. Married. Physically active. Employed ft. Bottle of wine or 7 beers a night type drinker. Vapes nicotine, drinks one cup of caffeinated coffee in the morning, takes Prozac, and eats sometimes like garbage but sometimes not. Here's my observation log: 

PROS
- I very rarely think about drinking or have cravings now. So, even though I'm technically one day shy of five months, I have a very high degree of confidence that unless someone holds me at knifepoint and forces it down my throat, I will not drink. 

- I get excited by things again and I really, really dig the more relaxed pace of life. Instead of churning ahead until 2 am and waking up like shit, I enjoy way more pleasant activities and social outings and way more relaxation at night as I wind down without booze. 

- Anxiety and depression issues, once severe, have abated a lot. I feel more outside my head than in it a lot. I still overthink, but I catch myself when im doing it. ;) 

- Face looks way younger. A lot of my lines have faded. This could be partially due to the fact that now I remember to do skin care at night, but overall, I feel like I got Botox, and I didnt. 

- Eyes are white and shiny, not bleary.

- I get my hair bleached blonde all the time. By now, between all the booze, sun, abd pools, my fine hair would have seriously broken at the ends. Its still well intact! 

- Fitness recovery is excellent. I broke my toe this week, so I can't run that hard. Next week will be a real test of how quickly I can bounce back to my current level. 

- I feel really lucky that I decided to do this and stuck with it, and I feel proud that I can make a post like this. Overall, I just have way more self confidence and love for myself than I did. 

- I dont typically weigh myself so I don't know about weight loss, but I feel a lot thinner and my body looks pretty damn good for 41. 

- I have way more verve to just do stuff. Like, I live in a place where the beach is very accessible. In the past five years, I've maybe dragged myself there three times. This year, Ive gone twice in as many weeks. I took myself on a day trip and went shopping. I just ENJOY stuff more. I cant really explain it other than I feel like Ive given myself permission to slow down and not rush through everything so I can get home and start partying. 

- My vegetable garden is flourishong because i take care of it now. :) 

CONS

- I am struggling to think of any, but of course if I am at a party and I see drunk people like hanging in the pool drinking in a little clique, I get a little FOMO. 

- I do have drinking dreams from time to time but there's also an incredible rush of relief when you realize it was just a dream. I also use those dreams as inspiration that starting up again isnt worth it--I always feel extremely disappointed and useless in those dreams when I drink and I dont feel like putting that on myself in real life.

The house is silent. There are no calls, no meetings, no noise asking for attention. Just time. It stretches wide and open, unfamiliar in its quiet.

You go to the kitchen. The coffee brews out of habit. No rush, no inbox. Just breath, and space you’re learning to notice.

Small rituals appear. Slower meals. Longer pauses at the window. A drawer full of things long ignored. Nothing urgent, but somehow everything is present.

The shift from doing to simply being feels strange. But maybe this silence is the beginning of something deeper. Maybe this is where presence begins. Not in effort, but in letting go. Some thoughts on it are shared [in this piece](https://www.clickworlddaily.com/2025/06/after-badge-after-titles-after-noise.html). Quiet hours. Unhurried presence. A new kind of meaning.

This has been my practice lately. Sitting with the quiet. Allowing it to teach me.

You may think that this guy was very hard done by. However in thinking that you would be quite mistaken. 

It turns out that he had been paying for items all day and when it was her turn to finally get something he ‘gently’ suggested that she pay. Still you’d think she’s the bad actor here. 

Let’s move the story on. They’ve been together for 20 months, he doesn’t have a job. She can afford the coffee because she has a high paying job but she doesn’t really want any fuckery over these small bills. He’s been telling her he has access to ‘generational wealth’ but she’s just seeing empty promises and she’s decided to end it. It’s not the price of a coffee that’s the problem here. 

It’s that there hasn’t been proper boundaries set when it comes to money, and let’s be honest, in China 20 months is long enough to put a ring on it. 

So to the original poster of this story that went wild on this subreddit today and subsequently got deleted. I’m not trolling here, I just want to offer some friendly advice:
1) 20 months is enough to put a ring on it. 
2) You said she was smart and beautiful - it seems she is. Surely that makes her a keeper. 
3) Get a stable job and income. Women respect that. 
4) It’s not a China problem the fact that you venmoed your long term girlfriend for a coffee - that’s a you problem 
5) Even if you ‘have access to generational wealth’, the only person you should be flexing that to is yourself. It sounds like it’s not true though as it seems like you are hard up for money these days. What you really wanted to say is that your parents are rich, or asset rich. And you are set to inherit a lot of money in about 30 years time. This isn’t really access to anything. And why are you even flexing in the first place? 
6) Treat your partner with the respect they deserve. 
7) Set proper boundaries when it comes to money - this should be face to face, at home, and should not come to boil when you’re out and about. 
8) Apologise. 
9) And if she’s a keeper then find a way to get her back. See, I told you I was trying to help. 
10) Good luck",50,1751811555.0,chinalife,95,0.65,False

My boyfriend and I will be visiting Munich for a month starting later this month to mid August. We’ll be staying in the Maxvorstadt district and are so incredibly excited! We’re coming from the U.S. (apologies for being Americans, we’re not fans of it here either), but we’re so looking forward to experience everything that Munich has to offer. 

I’ve done lots of light research on things to do and see while we’re there; mainly collecting lots of “things to do in Munich” TikTok videos. But I would love recommendations for the Maxvorstadt district! We’re both in our 30s and mainly love to experience coffee and cafes, shops, and anything museum, arts and culture. We’re not big club-goers, but we love to experience bars and pubs. He’ll tag along to things I enjoy, like bookshops, local boutiques, movie theaters, or weekend markets.

I would love to hear your recommendations as a local or frequent Munich visitor or if you’re familiar with the Maxvorstadt district. Also, if you have pharmacy or grocery market recommendations as Munich will be our home base for the month. 

Any suggestions are appreciated, so truly thank you so much if you take any time out of your day to respond about your favorite places!
