1ktqitr,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ktqitr/can_i_stay_in_touch_with_my_group_therapist_after/,Can I stay in touch with my group therapist after therapy ends?,"I’d really appreciate some honest perspectives on a situation I’m currently in.

I’m part of a therapy group that’s about to end soon, and over the past months, I’ve built a meaningful connection with the group therapist, not just in a therapeutic way, but as a person I genuinely respect and feel I’d get along with outside that setting. If it makes any difference, I would like to mention that it is a skill based group and not deep dive trauma etc.

To be clear: I understand the ethical boundaries during therapy, and I’m not talking about a romantic or inappropriate dynamic. I’m aware of the power imbalance that can exist in therapy, and I want to be careful and respectful of that.

That said, I’ve been thinking about whether or not I can ask her if she’d be open to keeping in touch after the group ends. Casually, like maybe a coffee at some point or even just staying in contact in some form. But only after the group therapy ends.

I won’t get into too many details but there is just a sense of genuine connection, like she truly enjoys our dynamic beyond the usual therapist-client rapport. I don’t want to overread or assume anything, but it has felt meaningful and personal in a way that stands out.

My question is:
	•	Have any of you ever seen or experienced something like this from either side (as a client or therapist)?
	•	Is it ever appropriate or possible to stay in touch once therapy has ended?
	•	Would asking, gently and respectfully already cross a line?

I’m trying to be honest but still grounded in reality. I’d love to hear your insights or experiences, whether you’re a therapist, client, or just someone who understands these dynamics.",1,1748024082.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

As someone who was going through a similar situation, I texted her and we both agreed to meet at a coffee shop. We both talked about our situations and past dating experiences. She was almost tearing up talking about it.

So I asked her if she wants to go out that will cheer her up. She agreed and then we got out of the coffee shop. As we started walking she all of a sudden told me that her dad is calling her and she needs to go home, and that she’s taking care of her mother or something. She said I can text her later on Reddit, I asked do you want to exchange numbers, she said I don’t want to do that right now, so I said okay.

Fast forward, after she left I texted her saying it was nice to meet her, everything will be fine…. Get home safe. After that she never responded to me. Now I don’t really know what to do or how to take it.

1ktqh3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/wahoofitness/comments/1ktqh3j/displaying_icons_on_v3_devices_on_routes_created/,Displaying icons on V3 devices on routes created in RideWithGPS,"After a lot of head scratching and cursing and back and forth with others, I think I've finally figured out how to reliably display icons on routes exported from RideWithGPS. I thought I would share my findings to save anyone else from this madness. Note: tests were done on Roam V3, but I assume the same applies to Bolt and Ace (please confirm). This applies to RideWithGPS. I don't know how this translates to other services. And note: you may need a subscription to RWGPS to add custom POIs / Waypoints / Cues.

This is what I've learned so far:

**Custom POIs**

General rule: Custom POIs, of supported types, that have been converted to Waypoints, either automatically or manually (using 'add to route'), that are within a certain distance (\~15-25m) from the route show as icons on Wahoo maps. 

You can confirm this by checking your cue list and seeing if the POI is listed. If it's not use the 'Add to Route' button to convert it to a waypoint, and then check your cue list. On the RWGPS map the icon should also display larger than non-converted ones.

Supported types are:

* 'Water' shows as water icon (blue).
* 'Food', 'Bar', 'Coffee', and 'Winery' show as food icon (purple).
* No other types are supported

Unsupported POI types (converted to waypoints), do not show icons, but will show cue notifications as you pass that location.

**Custom Cues**

General rule: Custom Cues, of type 'water' and 'food', that are within a certain distance (\~15-25m) from the route show as icons on Wahoo maps.

Supported types:

* 'Water' shows as water icon (blue).
* 'Food' shows as food icon (purple).
* No other types are supported

Unsupported custom cue types, do not show icons, but will show as cue notifications as you pass that location.

**Exporting the Route**

* Export using .fit or .tcx
* Don't rely on auto-sync as the device may overwrite the cues / POIs / waypoints with it's own. Or at least inspect the route on device before heading out on ride. (This one was frustrating!)

**So what going on?** 

Wahoo stores the route as a .fit file (which is a binary non-human readable format). .tcx is a close equivalent but in human readable XML, but basically follows the same spec.

The .fit spec only supports these course point types: generic, summit, valley, water, food, danger, left, right, straight, first\_aid, 4th\_category, 3rd\_category, 2nd\_category, 1st\_category, hors\_category, sprint, left\_fork, right\_fork, middle\_fork, sharp\_left, sharp\_right, uturn, stay\_left, stay\_right, start, finish.

And of those, only food and water display as icons on the Wahoo. So on export, RWGPS is likely converting any POIs/waypoints or cues that are water or food-ish to one of those types.

Whew. Wahoo does not make this easy. 

Please add anything I've missed, or let me know if I'm completely hallucinating on anything, and I'll update this post. And I swear I'm not a robot (although a robot helped with understanding fit and tcx files — so you can blame them if I'm wrong on any of that).

Cheers

2020 had the COVID-19 pandemic, TikTok became *massive*, CovidTok era songs like coffee for your head, Mood, How You Like That/Ice Cream by Blackpink, Dynamite by BTS, 2020s cartoons like The Owl House and Chikn Nuggit, and VTubers getting massive during the lockdowns and social distancing.

So many beautiful nights together. You felt like home. I don't know how to accept the duality of you. How the good was so good but you could also be so bad for me. 

I can't forget all the little things you did for me-- the trips to the store to pick us up coffee and snackies. The way you'd cook and make a little heart out of basil on my plate. The idle massages and hand squeezes. Falling asleep safe in your arms. The intensity that you loved. 

How could someone that cried at the thought of others in pain also inflict so much? How could you go to bed with another? How could you push my hurt aside while you made them glow? How could you keep them in your life when it killed me? 

I don't hate them, though. I get it. They were nice, caring. They were a lot like me. They filled that void for you that the distance created. But you hurt them too. Told us two different stories. And I think you believed both of your stories. I do.

I don't think you're a villain. You agonize over my pain. But you're selfish, and scared. Fear of being alone leads you into their arms, and fear of hurting others makes you hurt us both more. The fog of your personality disorder makes your reality crack at the seams before you. 

But still, you lied. Even if it's from a desperate traumatized part of yourself, you lied, gaslit, and manipulated. So many other times you minimized my concerns and downplayed your actions. You treated me like I was controlling for not wanting you to flirt with others. You had to have backup plans even though you were all I could think about being with. 

I hate that I relented on boundaries for you. I hate that I apologized when you were in the wrong. My brain was so twisted that I felt like if I made myself the one at fault, I could fix things. I so desperately wanted to. I wanted to forgive you but you broke your promises again.

I can't stop reaching out because I'm scared of you moving on. I don't want to be alone in this pain. But either answer hurts me. Hearing you say you can't live without me, that you wanted to marry me, that you can't live with the pain you caused me, it makes my heart ache for you. 

But getting on that flight home alone, when you promised you'd get on it with me, broke me beyond repair. I have no more hope to hold onto. I gave more than I had to give and now I have to sweep up the pieces of myself back into something almost human. I can never come back from this, and you'll never make the same sacrifices for me. So someday we'll be strangers again, and our time together will be a bittersweet, faded memory of a life that won't feel like my own anymore. ",1,1748023775.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

Now I'm doubting whether it was the right decision.

We were together for 4 years. I'm 34, she's 31. This year we were planning to buy an apartment and start a family. But in the end, I chose to walk away. I’m struggling with the decision, even though part of me knows it was the right one.

She was extremely jealous, I couldn’t even speak to another woman without feeling anxious. She used silence as punishment for almost every disagreement. Once on vacation, she didn’t talk to me for 2 days because she claimed I looked at other women. On our last vacation, she ignored my phone calls and gave me the silent treatment again because I left her alone on the beach for a while, even though I told her exactly where I was going. There were also times she went silent just because I didn’t do some chores in the kitchen. 

I have just one close friend in the city where I live and she was jealous of him too. She gave me the silent treatment just for spending time with him. Her explanation? That she didn’t know where I was going, or that she once waited with me at the bus stop when I was heading to the shopping center to meet him for coffee. We have “coffee time” once a week, for a maximum of 3 hours including travel to the mall.

The final straw was when she gave me an ultimatum, either go on a trip with her friends, or we break up. I did know them, but she constantly pressured me to be around them, even when I didn’t feel like it. At one point, she even accused me of being interested in one of her female friends,  someone I had barely interacted with. I chose the breakup and we lived together in silence for the next 3 weeks. Two days before she moved out, I initiated a short conversation.

In our final conversation, she accused my mother of removing her from her friends list, something that never happened. When I asked my mom about it, she was genuinely hurt, because she had always liked her. My ex also told me, *""what if you turn out like the unfaithful part of your family you’re not even in contact with?""* That hit me deeply, because I come from a well-grounded and respectful family. She said that in the last 3 weeks she experienced more than in our 4 years together. She questioned whether I’d even take care of our future children. And then she said she was leaving.

Yes, I could’ve shown more affection. I could’ve taken her out more to the cinema, the theatre, or even just for walks. According to her, I didn’t do that enough. About a year before the breakup, I made a mistake. While learning English, I used an app called Interpals and chatted with a woman from a country 2,500 km away for about two weeks. It was never romantic just practice and conversation. But when my girlfriend found out, she threw my phone against the wall. After that, I gave her the password to my phone to try to rebuild her trust.

In my defense, over the past three years I’ve completely changed careers from electrician to data science. On top of working full-time, I’ve been studying externally and I’m graduating next month with honors. My salary has tripled since I started this journey because I wanted us to have a better life.

Now I’m alone. I miss the good part of her. I know she loved me in her own way. But her way always involved silence and pressure. I’ve been living alone for two weeks now. A week ago, she came to pick up her last things. She didn’t say goodbye, just stood by the door and left. Later that evening, she sent me a message on WhatsApp:

""Goodbye.""

I replied with: ""Goodbye. I wish you all the best in life.""

Then, a few hours later, she followed up with: ""I’m really sorry about how this ended, but from the bottom of my heart I wish you find what you’re looking for and that you’ll be happy.""

I responded: ""I’m sorry too. I’m not looking for anything, I just want peace. Without communication, trust, and calm, a relationship can’t work. Thank you.""

She answered: ""I never had a problem talking to you. We built trust together and I wasn’t the one who ruined it. You already have your peace.""

I didn’t respond after that, I just couldn’t. Was my decision the right one or may i write her back? ",3,1748023434.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

She only felt joy when looking at that clock; sometimes touching it just to remind herself of her husband. Even his imperfections, his wrinkled hands, his very apparent freckles on said hands; every part of him only made her want Tucker to come home faster.
	Once it was a quarter till ten Trudy began to look out the window, Alining candles, flipping blankets and pillows to keep the time passing. Every second Tucker wasn’t there, only scared Trudy. He’s never home this late. She wondered if she should take a nap, do her hair, flip the pillows and blankets again. Five minutes after ten she finally heard the noises of Tucker’s car. Her anxiety had quickly cleansed into contempt. Before greeting Tucker; Trudy flipped the pillows one more time and brushed all the dust on to the apron fixed to her dress. Standing in the living room waiting for Tucker to get out of the car, close the door, walk on the pavement brick up to their porch, walk up to the door, insert the key into the keyhole, twist the key and open the door, but there was a very noticeable hesitation of Tucker to even turn off the car. Something bad had happened at work. Even then Trudy had sat very patiently at her sewing station, glancing at the still turned on automobile that was outside.
	Once Tucker was outside his car; Trudy laid her sewing machine aside and walked up to the door. Greeting him with a kiss, then taking off his coat.
	“Hello, honey.” Trudy said, in a sort of melody whilst clinging the coat onto the coat rack.
	“Hello, dear.” Tucker responded. Fumbling towards the couch and laying down. 
Tucker's noticeable exhaustion only had Trudy worried. She swiftly walked towards her sewing station, turning on the machine, the droning of the machine had only broken the static of the silence, a new silence had been created. The noise of the machine hadn’t been noticeable, especially to Trudy, an answer is what she wanted, something other than then the constant mechanism that punctured Tuckers hat. Tucker reached over to the empty table in front of him. While noticing nothing was on the table he groaned.
“Sorry dear, I’ve just been so busy I probably forgot, please forgive me!” Trudy turned off her machine again and ran towards the kitchen.
“You’re fine honey, It’s been a long day for all of us.”
Trudy emerged from the kitchen with a freshly cleaned, steel ringed wine rack, glasses, glass pots with chinese patterns, and a dark golden liquor enclosed inside a glass bottle. With steady hands, Trudy placed all the glasses on top of the table.
“The lights are hurting my eyes Trudy, mind turning them off?” Tucker asked,
“Of course, dear.” Moving away from the table and towards the light switch; turning it off left and irritating red glow between the blinds, a light in columns that blanketed the living room. Trudy stood by the light switch waiting for any further instructions. It hadn’t taken long for Tucker to notice.
“Jesus, Trudy, it’s not like you're a robot, you can sit down!” Tucker exclaimed. The sudden bluntness of Tucker’s deliverance stunned Trudy, cocking her head to the left in surprise. 
She ushered over to the coffee table and poured two drinks, a heavy one for Tucker and a less heavy one for herself. She walked over to her sewing station and twisted the chair towards Tucker, enjoying just the view of him laying down rubbing his temples. After a couple of seconds that felt like hours, Tucker propped himself on the sofa and reached for the drink on top of a stained glass coaster, swearling it before chugging it down with a single gulp. Trudy didn't drink yet, tapping the rim of the glass whilst watching Tucker swallow his. Tucker stumbled forward trying to grab the golden yellow whisky.
“Here let me grab you some, you’re obviously in no condition to do it yourself!” Trudy got up before being scolded by Tucker, “Sit down.”
Trudy again tooken back Tucker’s remarks before sitting down again. Gathering himself, Tucker poured another glass.
“If you don’t want to, we don’t have to go out to dinner. Just tell me what you want and I’ll cook it up for you, we have it in our food cellar.”
“Trudy, Sit Down.”
“Tucker what’s going on, you’re scaring me.” Trudy looked closer to Tucker, a prominent frown plastered on his face. Before placing the glass back down onto the coaster, Tucker took one last big gulp before facing Trudy. The couple strips of red light peeking through the window revealed Tucker’s eyes, guilt, regret, but also anger, and betrayal. Trudy sat up straight, again cocking her head to the left.
“I want to leave you.” Tucker clasped his hands together, “It’s not because of you, Trudy; I love you; I’m just. I’ve been seeing someone.”
Trudy didn’t know what to think, she at first wanted to deny this remark, she’s done everything for Tucker. Given him food, bared his son. She wanted this to just be a sick joke. She knew he wasn't joking.
“For how long?” Trudy asked,
“Longer than I’d like to admit.” Tucker replied.
“Is there something I did wrong, I can be better, better than her. I did everything for you!” Trudy’s agitation grew, confusion, betrayal. Why leave now, why leave her, her family, his promise to her; his promise to make a family with her.
“Tucker, this isn’t fair! What did I do to you, Why are you leaving me! Leaving me if I didn’t do anything wrong! What did I do Tucker! Tell me! Tell Me Now!”
“Trudy you don’t understand let me explain, it’s just-” Tucker’s calm demeanor, the soft quiet guilt in his voice only angered Trudy more.
“I DON'T GET WHAT! Tell me, educate me as to what I don't know, to flee from me, run away from me, Our family! To spend time with this other woman.” 
“Trudy, you're scaring me,” Tucker’s irritatingly calm response to her screaming, legitimate complaints, left only disbelief, anguish and anger in Trudy. These tears of hers weren’t of sadness, they were of anger, pure rage.
“Trudy you don’t get it, you’re the other woman.”
Couldn’t get her eyes to open wide, not wide enough to that, that love she had for Tucker, loving him for his minor imperfections turned into traits she despised. She was never grateful for any of the gifts Tucker gave her, those vacation tickets, those inventions, small gadgets and trinkets Tucker gave to her was to only keep her stay put, not ask questions, not suspect their love for each other. How could she be so gullible, she wanted to crawl out of her skin, she wanted to rip out his bones, her own bones. Use his nerves for the strings of a harp and she wanted to pluck every single one of them. Use his skin and hair for her new clothing line. The promise Tucker gave her, to treat and make her life better. All the sacrifices she made for Tucker, for her kid, her home, and community.
“I’ll start dinner.” With her head down she stumbled towards the kitchen and into the cellar. This time Tucker didn’t stop her. She was automatic, she couldn’t believe herself, not for the fact she was the side piece of a marriage that may or may not have kids, a wife who may or may not be happier. She opened the Freezer hatchet without thought, it was just muscle memory, to grab the first thing her hand landed on and cook that. It was the leg of a lamb. Alright, she was having lamb. The lamb was covered in a clear plastic bag wrapped over and over again to create cover and a “Love Your Husband!” sticker sticking the end of the bag to the rest of the bag. Trudy ripped the bag apart as opposed to the usual delicate peeling she would care for when cooking her meals. The sticker was taunting her. She crumpled the paper and threw it in front of her, stepping on it on her way out.
Her sorrow has not processed how heavy the lamb was, she hadn’t thought of it until she heard the thump of the lamb hitting the kitchen counter.
“Trudy, don't make me dinner, I’m going out.” Tucker had his back turned to Trudy, looking through the window, his hands behind his back. He looked precariously at the billboard across the street.
“With whom, your actual wife, does she have kids, a child she’s got the burden of caring for because of his deadbeat father.” No matter how hard she’d tried to sound a semblance of emotion, it could only come across salty, venomous.
“I didn’t forget about your son, I’ve lended you money so I contributed some, what else do you need from me?” Tucker turned to Trudy, “Don’t cry Trudy, it would be bad for my job.” Trudy’s grip on the lamb only tightened, It only felt like instinct. She walked to Tucker, the lamb in her hand.
“Tucker you can’t leave!”
“Jesus Trudy, let this go, you’re acting emotional right now.”
Involuntarily Trudy raised the lamb above Tucker’s head, the shadow didn’t go unnoticed. With a sickening crunch, Tucker stumbled over to the side; away from the window. In desperation, Tucker grabbed onto anything he could get a reliable grasp on. Before he could protest, Trudy again; with full force, struck the lamb on to the top of Tucker’s head, and another sickening crunch was heard, however a noticeable couple of bones have been dislocated from Tucker’s neck. Before Tucker could fall over, Trudy saw fear for the first time in Tucker’s eyes. His eyes were open, which wasn’t unnatural, but felt wrong to look at. For a moment Trudy thought Tucker was still alive, before his body hit the floor without a pulse.
“Alright, I did it, I killed a man.” It took too long for Trudy to realize what she’d done, one after another emotions of relief, fear, sadness, and anger consumed her, painting in her head like some sick portrait. Trudy threw the lamb onto a baking sheet, shoved it into the oven; put it on high, and left.
She then just grabbed her bag, knocked a couple of things, and went to her car. She rehearsed the lines over and over again, ‘can I have potatoes and peas?” Her voice was peculiar, she tried it again, this time it sounded awkward. She practiced the line until it sounded natural. “Yes Man, can I have some potatoes, oh and a can of peas.” She rehearsed it a couple of more times until it felt natural; after she had rehearsed she put the keys into the ignition and drove off. Whilst driving, Trudy hadn’t thought of the situation she got herself in. Sure she knew she was making an alibi for herself, however what would happen if she were caught. She couldn’t let that happen, not with a family soon. Being the widow to a famous genius inventor, secrets, lies, and deception were not things she was foreign too. However she's' better than Tucker, She’s’ not lying, She’s’ simply acting. However a noticeable paranoia was present in Trudy, she’s never been so focused, focused on minor or insignificant details in trees or the shades of light that illuminate the streets.

“Hey Man.” Trudy smiled as if she were forced to, “forgot some things, see we usually eat out at the end of every week; Me and Tucker. Tucker was just too tired so we decided not tonight.” Her forced smile widened
“Hmh, good man, you’re really lucky Trudy to have a devoted man like Tucker be your husband, even after creating the best invention, the garage door, and they’re still making him work.”
“Well the perks of being the…,” Trudy hesitated for a second before stuttering, “Wife of a famous inventor.”
Trudy’s uncertainty hadn’t gone unnoticed. “You feeling okay Mrs. Trout?” Trudy had studied these lines before, over and over again and still the harsh reality sprung back to her, she had to stop herself from crying.
“I’m-fine, It’s just been a long day for all of us.” Trudy’s face contorts, a smile still plastered on her face.
“I wouldn't want to push this issue any further but it’s obvious you’re not okay.”
Trudy hadn’t thought of this happening, on one hand; If she were to expose Tucker's secret, call the police; that would give her a motive, and would have made her a suspect. But if she were to come up with a lie, the police could check to see if she was telling the truth.
“It’s just, what If I’m not good enough as a wife, I’ve done everything for Tucker and yet, I still feel…Stail? It’s not coming to me right now but I hope you understand.” Trudy couldn’t help but let a couple of tears slip from her eyes.
“Oh! Well, I can’t relate specifically but I think I understand,” Man looks at Trudy, with both sympathy and understanding, “Would it be like being numb or stuck in a sense.”
“In a sense, I would hate to waste your time.” Trudy took out a check book whilst also taking out tissues to wipe the mascara that was running down her cheek, small chunks of clotted eyeliner blackened Trudy’s tears.
“Oh no I really don’t mind, not a lot of people come in here this late anyways, want a smoke, it’s on the house.”
“Really, you’d do that for me?” Trudy wiped away her tears and stuffed the tissues back into her already cluttered purse.
“Take a smoke for a second, here I have something of my own to share.” Leaning against the counter, handing Trudy a cigar, Man cleared his throat as if he were about to give a speech.
“I have a crush on someone, here, right in peachyville.”
“Really.” Trudy couldn’t care, she was digging through her purse, locking and unlocking pockets, whenever she was overwhelmed with the amount of unnecessary trash in her purse, she would rub the leather texture of her purse on the third joint of her pointer finger. Once she finally found a lighter she tried striking it, It hadn’t lit, she tried again, it again hadn’t lit. After a couple more failed attempts, she let her arms go limp in defeat as an exasperated sigh escaped her mouth. Man looked at Trudy with a mix of amusement but also worried, taking his own lighter out, he helped Trudy light her cigarette.
“So, about this crush.” said Trudy as she let out the smoke from her lungs.
“Really, I thought you got bored of me.” Man lit his own cigar, “If you insist, There is this particular car salesman. He’s hot headed, but I promise you I can fix him.”
“Which salesman, there are like three of those over here…for some reason.”
“His name is Tony. I saw him in the operating room the other day, the dumbass broke his arm. Apparently a teenager, big dude, walked in and fought Tony. His reason, because Tony denied his service.”
“A teenager fighting a grown man, put that on the papers.” Trudy once again took another puff of her cigarette.
“Yeah, big threat this teenager is, he mostly goes after a teen, his name; Francis. He got bullied so much he almost jumped, his parents gave him a lobotomy however so he’s all fine now,” Man took one last puff before spitting the cigar out of his mouth onto the ground, stomping on it to light it out, “So, about those potatoes and peas; want Idaho potatoes?”
“Oh yes; two of those please!” exclaimed Trudy, this time her tone was brighter, bouncier. Her sudden change in demeanor was noticed by Man.
“Feeling better Trudy?” asked Man.
“Yeah, I needed that,” Trudy said, “I need to get back home now, If I don’t; dinner might be burnt. Can’t let Tucker go through that.”
“Speaking of Tucker, tired; you said? He must be out like a light by now!”
“You have no Idea.” 
“Yeah, I wouldn’t know, but for what it’s worth, I think you’re doing great, you’re a great person Trudy, and an even better wife.”
Leaving to get the peas and potatoes, Trudy was left alone. The occasional ticking of the clock kept her awake. After stripping a family of a father, killing said father, crying her eyes out, and smoking afterwards, Trudy was exhausted. She could only think to herself if she should Finish the rest of her alibi tomorrow and sleep tonight, but she knew she needed to get her alibi done as fast as possible.
“Here you go Mrs. Trout.” Man handed over a small brown paper bag of peas, Idaho potatoes, and a bouquet of white and red roses.
“Is this your idea of asking me out on a date?” Trudy remarked, “I hate to be the bearer of bad news but I'm married.”
“Oh, no no no, those aren't for you, those are for…Tony. Mind dropping them off at his residence before heading home?” 
“Do you know where he lives?”
“No…However he may be in his office, at the car dealership.”
“I'll see what I can do. Thanks, really; I needed that smoke.” Trudy then left, one hand carrying Tony’s flowers; and the other, her alibi.
On her drive to Tony’s Cars! Cars! Cars!, she convinced herself that she was just Trudy, a trad wife coming home from her local supermarket to feed her dearest Tucker. He's at home hungry. She even started to hum a tune to forget the night she had.
Stopping at Tony’s there was a single janitor mopping the checkered tiled black and white floors. Neon colored lights are in the form of signs, a single botched mangled sign kept together by plates of metal and plywood. Trudy stepped out of her car, the ambiance of chirping crickets had become more apparent compared to when she was at the supermarket. An incessant buzzing was heard from the neon sign accommodated onto the building. Trudy tapped on the glass of the doors, catching the attention of the janitor. The janitor, a young, pimple ridden teenager, wearing a pear of crummy black pants and an equally crummy stained brown shirt tucked into the pants. 
“What are you doing here, Tony had specifically instructed me to not let any unsupervised customers in his store.” said the Janitor.
“I’m only here to drop off a bouquet for Tony. Do you know if he’s here?” Trudy asked.
Why would he be here, It’s after hours, knowing him he’s probably stuffed in his shack he calls a home. Does it say who it’s from?”
“Hmh, I prefer not to say.”
“Damn Tony, always sending himself flowers pretending they were sent by my mom, he’s really weird.”
“Do I want to know?”
“Probably not, you can call him now, I’m not paid enough to care.”
	Being gifted entry Trudy heads towards the phone, laid dormant on the receptionist desk is a phone with messy flames painted on, next to it, a pamphlet sized phone book with the Italian flag cropped into the background. Going alphabetically Trudy Finally reached Tony’s number.
	“Hello sexy, finally broke up with your boyfriend, told you your womanly instinct would drive you to me, meet me behind the ice chest tomorrow.” A confident Tony on the other end doing god knows what.
“...Trudy speaking.”
“Oh, Trudy, sorry; thought you were a fifteen year old, what do you need?”
“Sorry to interrupt whatever you were doing, I have a delivery for you. I didn’t know where you lived, so I'm here at your dealership. Anyways can you tell me where you live or just pick it up over here.”
“Damn it Francis! Don’t let anybody but disclosed personnel in here after hours!” Tony’s shouting at Francis might as well be nonexistent as his words hadn’t fazed Francis.
“This will be a cut in your paycheck Francis! Anyways, you said delivery for me.”
“Yeah, a bouquet of flowers from a secret admirer.”
	“I knew she’d come around one day or another, you hear that Francis.” Francis only rolled his eyes.
“I’ll leave these here for you tomorrow.”
“What, c’mon Trudy, why not come over?”
“I would really not want to, I have to go feed Tucker.”
“Trudy! Don’t Hang U-” Before Tony could get his last word out, Francis had disconnected the phone.
“You probably want to get out.”
“Yes, I have to feed Tucker, he must be so hungry right now.” Trudy then stormed out of the store, leaving Francis alone in the mixed colored lights.
Driving home Trudy again repeated what she thought before coming to Tony’s; She’s just Trudy, a trad wife coming home to feed her husband supper. Guiding the car up to the driveway; getting out of the car; walking on the pavement brick that led up to the porch; rushing to the door, and before inserting the key into the keyhole, Trudy heard an older woman call out to her.
“Trudy! Trudy over here!” said the older woman. 
Every second Trudy is stripped away from finishing her night, made it less believable to assume her husband was alive and just hungry, flickering her eye lids in annoyance and letting go of the door handle, she gave the nicest ‘yes’ she could.
“Yes,” Trudy replied, Trudy turned around to see elementary school teacher Kelsey, “Hey Kelsey, why are you up so late?”
“I could ask the same about you,” Kelsey rushed from the opposite side of the street and onto Trudy’s lawn. “ say have you and Tucker decided if you wanted to take your kiddo to school or not?”
“Don’t know, not my top priority right now, I have to feed Tucker.”
“Trudy, you can go a minute without thinking of Tucker, You can think for yourself.”
“You’re right, I’m thinking. I’m thinking you should leave me alone right now, I have to feed my…,” Trudy inhales, taking a minute to calm herself down, again rubbing her finger against the rubber of her purse,” My husband, I have to feed my husband. This can be a problem tomorrow, okay Kelsey.”
Kelsey inched her way to the porch where Trudy stood, maneuvering her way past the bed of flowers planted in Trudy’s yard, and past Tucker’s car onto the pavement brick that led up to the porch.
“I know, think about it, your kid can build connections and confidence, I’ll give you time of course. There are just advantages of going to school.”
“There are also disadvantages of going to school, look at Francis, I don’t want to give my kid a lobotomy to make sure they aren’t tempted to jump.” Trudy inserts her key into the keyhole, preparing herself for a reaction.
“I know, I just; want you to give it thought.”
Trudy stands silent in the doorway before inhaling again.
“I’ll sit down and talk to you about this tomorrow if it makes you feel better,” Trudy turned to Kelsey, Trudy tried to conjure up the best smile she could muster. It had seemed to fooled Kelsey, although fidgeting with her hands, she looked up towards Trudy with a pleased smile on her face, “now, I have to feed Tucker, If I don’t hurry dinner might be burnt, I still need to cook the peas, peas and potatoes Kelsey!”
“Will you actually sit down with me Trudy?”
“If I give you $20, will you leave me alone?”
“Deal!”
Trudy digs through her purse looking for her check book, writing a twenty on it, she hands the check to Kelsey. Kelsey then smells the paper. Trudy steps back in surprise, cocking her head to the right. 
“Nothing beats the smell of fresh paper.”
“Yeah, fresh. Take good care of yourself now.”

1ktq2xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ktq2xt/aita_for_not_tipping_enough_and_embarrassing_my/,AITA for not tipping enough and “embarrassing” my friend?,"Long story short: my lifelong friend seems to think I’m a chronically bad tipper after one bad experience a long time ago.

For context this was in Los Angeles county, cerca 2012. It was New Year’s Day and we were extremely hungover. 

Went to a local diner and I ordered a breakfast burrito with no meat. Just eggs, cheese, and potato, plus a side of ranch (judge if you want, but it’s my long-time go-to hangover cure). FWIW I had been a vegetarian at that time for over a decade.

So my friend and I are sipping our coffee and water, just groaning quietly until the food arrives. When it does, the first bite I take tears into a mushy strip of bacon, which then gets tugged out of the burrito and greasily slaps against my chin.

Admittedly grossed out, I discretely collect the bad bite in a napkin and push the plate away. I honestly didn’t have the energy to get upset or anything. I just sat there quietly battling the pre-existing queasiness.

A few minutes later I politely sent the burrito back. By the time the replacement came out, I had lost my appetite. I boxed it up to-go and left a 10% tip on a bill of less than $15. I thought it was fair, all things considered.

My friend got a separate check, but I saw her eyeing my receipt as I signed it. When I got up, she dropped an extra couple dollars on top of MY bill’s little black folder, grumbling about how embarrassing it is when people don’t appreciate service workers, even half-jokingly threatening to never dine out with me again if I’m going to be so cheap.

I got embarrassed and (privately) a little angry. I felt too shitty to argue though. I just left it alone. Now many years later, she still gets quietly (but not so subtly) suspicious of whether I’m tipping enough anytime we go out. 

So… AITA? Maybe everyone sucks here? I probably shouldn’t even care but she’s a good friend and it seems unfairly critical. 

Give it to me straight, internet jury. I think can take it.

1ktq037,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ktq037/aita_wife_says_i_dont_help_out_enough_around_the/,AITA: Wife says I dont help out enough around the house?,"So some backgorund on this,

  
 I work as a systems engineer and developer without any offshore support for a large enterprise application. This means I often am up until 3 AM keeping an eye on my support channels, servers, and monitoring. In addition to this, I have recently been waking up at 8-9 AM to meet with customers since after 11 AM my day is pretty much all meetings and development efforts. I normally work from home and sometimes I may have an hour or so to relax so I do exactly that. I may load up a game on my computer and just kill some time while having my laptop open next to me in case I need to immediately jump into something. I mean, if I'm working this much you have to have at least some time to enjoy something.  I work hard to give us a good quality of life - she doesnt have to worry about anything unless its something she wants to do.  She doesnt have to worry about the stress of bills, the house, the cars, or food shopping. 

  
As for my wife, she goes to nail school for 4 hours in the morning (normally 9 to 12) and then she has a cleaning job which she does from about 5 to 7ish (2-3 hours a day). 

I dont ask her to do anything and am not difficult to be around. I'm not picky, I dont say she has to do this or that. A lot of what she does she chooses to do as a wife which I completely respect. I normally never eat breakfast but she makes me breakfast anyway. Sure, I might not get to take a bit until a few hours later when its cold, but at least its there. 

  
So today she basically said how I dont help out enough around the house. I told her, when I'm working at home, consider me not even here. I dont get out of my chair for upwards to six hours unless its a quick bio break then im back to it. I was a bit confused since even though I work from home, all the responsibility for everything falls on me. 

I still help out with a lot - when she cooks, I do the dishes. When she asks for my help with something, obviously I help. If she wants to get coffee before work, I'll take her and go with her. If she wants to go out to eat, go shopping, do literally anything - I bring her. Sure, if I wake up in a rush and have to jump on an issue immediately I'm not spending the time to make the bed. If the dog has an accident downstairs and I havent got up out of my chair for hours - how am I supposed to see that? When we go food shopping I go with her, help her pick things out, unload the groceries together, etc.. And if I know shes stressed or had a bad day, I'll order food for us so she doesnt have to cook. Sure I didnt cook it, but now she can relax and not deal with it. I probably do this a few times a week to be honest.

I literally sometimes have less than a minute to jump out of bed, get logged in to my computer, and start working on an issue that potentially could take the entire day. 

  
So.. question is.. what the hell am I doing wrong? lol.

1ktpzr9,https://i.redd.it/dyadylj6lk2f1.jpeg,Heat-Pump Water Heater or Gas Tank? Which Scores Higher on Ontario’s 2025 Rebate Tables?,"# Steam-burn coffee and a sweaty mechanical room—my tipping-point moment

I used to ignore my water heater the way you ignore a refrigerator light: vaguely aware it works, never curious how. That changed on Family Day when our ancient atmospheric gas tank wheezed itself off mid-shower—just as relatives arrived with ski helmets matted to their hair. I scrambled downstairs, flooded in blue pilot-light flashes and the smell of unburned gas, and thought, “If I’m replacing this dinosaur, why not chase the new rebates everyone keeps bragging about?”

Cue a three-week spiral of Reddit threads, government PDFs, and contractor quotes. I discovered that Ontario’s **Home Renovation Savings Program (HRSP)**—launching province-wide 28 Jan 2025—hands noticeably larger cheques to households that ditch fossil-fuel tanks for **heat-pump water heaters (HPWHs)**. But there are caveats: cold-basement performance, electrical panel capacity, noise, and sticker surprise. The post below captures everything I learned, minus the cold-shower trauma.

*(Main policy references: Ontario HRSP backgrounder* [*https://news.ontario.ca/en/backgrounder/1005539/ontarios-new-and-expanded-energy-efficiency-programs*]() *, Enbridge HER+ update* [*https://www.enbridgegas.com/residential/rebates-energy-conservation/home-efficiency-rebate-plus*]() *, NRCan HPWH factsheet* [*https://natural-resources.canada.ca/energy-efficiency/energystar-canada/about/feature-products/heat-pump-water-heaters/24887*]()*)*

# Quick tech refresher—how each heater works

|Technology|Core mechanics|Why the province cares|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Atmospheric gas tank**|Natural gas burns under steel tank; flue drafts via chimney|Cheap upfront, but steady standby losses and direct GHG emissions|
|**Power-vent or condensing gas tank**|Fan-assisted exhaust; condensing model captures heat from flue gases|Better efficiency (ENERGY STAR), still burns gas|
|**Heat-pump water heater (hybrid)**|Small electric heat pump pulls heat from ambient air, transfers to water; backup electric elements|2–3× efficient vs electric resistance, runs on grid power that’s 90 % emissions-free in Ontario [https://www.ieso.ca/en/Learn/Ontario-Electricity-Data]()|

*Terminology tip:* Many installers call HPWHs “hybrid” or “air-source” water heaters because they switch to electric coils in cold snaps.

# Rebate snapshot—who gets the bigger slice of government pie?

# A) Provincial HRSP 2025

* **Heat-Pump Water Heater**: listed under “Electrification & High-Efficiency Appliances.” Qualifies for the **full 30 %** rebate tier if combined with at least one envelope measure (e.g., attic insulation).
* **High-Efficiency Gas Water Heater**: qualifies only if you **replace an older non-condensing tank** and pair with two envelope measures. Rebate percentage drops (classified as “Incremental Efficiency Upgrade”).

Table excerpt (see full PDF p.12): [`https://www.ontario.ca/document/home-renovation-savings-program-guidelines-2025.pdf`](https://www.ontario.ca/document/home-renovation-savings-program-guidelines-2025.pdf)

# B) Enbridge HER+ (for gas-heated homes)

* HPWH: labelled a “bonus electrification measure” with a lump-sum incentive.
* Condensing gas tank: small fixed incentive, contingent on additional insulation/air-sealing.

Enbridge guide: [`https://www.enbridgegas.com/-/media/Extranet-Pages/Residential/REBATE-DOCUMENTS/HERPlus-Terms-and-Conditions.ashx`](https://www.enbridgegas.com/-/media/Extranet-Pages/Residential/REBATE-DOCUMENTS/HERPlus-Terms-and-Conditions.ashx)

# C) Federal CMHC Green Home refund

Mortgage insurance premium refund **up to 25 %** if total reno boosts EnerGuide score by prescribed points—HPWH contributes more than gas tank due to zero on-site combustion.

CMHC criteria: [`https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/consumers/home-buying/green-home`](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/consumers/home-buying/green-home)

**Bottom-line math** (without quoting fragile dollar amounts): HPWH unlocks larger total incentives **and** can qualify you for tiers that gas tanks can’t touch, thanks to electrification credits.

# Upfront cost delta—why installers quote wildly different numbers

1. **Equipment price**: HPWHs list higher MSRP than 40-gal condensing tanks.
2. **Electrical upgrades**: 240 V / 30 A circuit may require panel spaces; older Toronto semis with 100 A service often need panel-swap or load-calculation letter (ESA filing fee applies).
3. **Condensate management**: HPWHs drip water like A/C coils; need floor drain or condensate pump.
4. **Ducting (optional)**: directing cool exhaust air into adjacent rooms keeps basement comfortable, but adds flex-duct labour.

Contractors who specialise in HVAC-plus-hydronics quote higher because they size mixing valves, recirc pumps, and noise baffles properly. “Big-box install teams” may quote lower but skip envelope integration that maximises rebates.

# Performance in Ontario basements—cold climate myth-busting

# A) Ambient temperature sweet spot

HPWHs lose efficiency below \~10 °C. In my unfinished basement they consistently saw 14–17 °C even in February (thanks to furnace duct leakage). Data loggers showed COP \~2.2 (twice resistance electric) per SenseEnergy monitor [https://sense.com/blog/heat-pump-water-heaters-explained/]().

# B) Noise

Most units hum 45–55 dB—fan sound like a fridge. I mounted mine on rubber vibration pads (plumber tossed them in free; ask!). Door closed three metres away, you hear nothing.

# C) Recovery rate

Gas still wins for back-to-back teen showers. HPWHs include “High-Demand” mode activating coils; energy blip kills efficiency but still qualifies for rebates because baseline mode delivers savings.

NRCan side-by-side study (Ottawa test home) — [https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection\_2024/rncan-nrcan/M154-147-2024-eng.pdf]()

# Lifespan, maintenance, and safety

|Factor|HPWH|Gas Tank|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Expected lifespan**|10–15 years (heat-pump compressor dictates)|8–12 years (anode rod limits)|
|**Annual maintenance**|Wash filter, vacuum coils|Test T&P valve, check anode|
|**CO / combustion risk**|None|Present; vent blockage alarms critical|
|**Freeze risk**|Extracts heat; can cool room; not a risk if condensate trap heat-taped|None in conditioned space|

# Real-life GTA install timeline

1. **Energy audit #1** (HRSP prerequisite)
2. **ESA load calculation**—electrician submits if panel near limit.
3. **Order unit**—big box stock improving; Rheem ProTerra and AO Smith Voltex now warehouse in Vaughan.
4. **Plumbing permit**—Toronto only if relocating drain pan.
5. **One-day swap**—old tank out, HPWH in, condensate pump plumbed, 240 V tied.
6. **Energy audit #2**—submit receipts. Rebate cheque shows up 1–2 months later.

# Situations where gas tank still makes sense

* **Rural propane**: HPWH COP dips in unheated utility sheds; propane condensing tanks sometimes cheaper lifecycle cost.
* **Space-heat synergy**: Small infill homes using tankless combi-boilers for hydronic heating already buy gas; adding HPWH complicates mechanical room.
* **Panel-upgrade panic**: If 60 A service plus EV charger looming, panel + utility disconnect fees can tilt ROI.

# Decision checklist—ask yourself before signing quote

1. **Is your service panel 100 A with free two-pole breaker slot?**
2. **Do you have floor drain within six feet?**
3. **Finished basement ceiling height > 6’8”?** HPWHs are taller than tanks.
4. **Family peak hot-water draw?** Consider adding mixing valve to bump set-point.
5. **Stacking rebates?** Pair HPWH with attic insulation to hit HRSP Tier 2.
6. **Long-term plan for gas line?** Future electrification (heat-pump furnace) synchronises panel work.

# Share your data—crowd wisdom beats brochure stats

* Anyone running a HPWH through a full GTA winter—what was your room temp drop?
* Did your ESA inspector question breaker load calculations?
* Gas-tank loyalists: have condensing models actually matched efficiency promises?

I’m LL4U now, my heartache is gone, I’m just a shell of who I used to be and I’m not even mad about it. I’ve been thinking a lot about the comments he’s made towards me during arguments and why I feel like this now.. it’s because he’s made me feel like a burden all these years. Financially, physically and emotionally a burden in his life. A few months ago I posted about how our sex life did a 180 after the last time I tried to bring it up and I was right. The attraction to me truly wasn’t there. It was all fake. I had showered early one day and he wanted me to sit outside while he did some yard work. I didn’t want to as I’ve already showered, it’s hot and I’ll get sweaty. He said “I bet you’d be out here if I was putting my dick in you” I just shrugged it off and didn’t think much of it. Just now realizing today it was meant to make me feel like an annoyance. Just like all the other comments he makes about how he pays all the bills, busts his ass at work and provides for the family. My fault my fault.. didn’t mean to burden you with the responsibilities you wanted… but ok. Anywho. I’m tired, I just want to be loved and that’ll never happen here. It’s deeper than “just sex” (his words) I’ve never loved someone so much to the point it destroyed who I am as a person… he gave me the best high I’ve ever had when we first met and I had to withdraw cold turkey as soon as we moved in together. I got addicted to the heartache he gave me because that was the only emotional feeling I could get. I kept initiating knowing he would turn me down just to feel my heart break a little more. I’d beg for crumbs of attention and threw myself at him for years. How fuckin embarrassing.. to want a man so bad while he sucks the life out of you. I’m sick thinking about it. Yall have a great day and go do something that makes YOU happy. Get your nails/toes/hair done, go tan, put some makeup on and take a selfie. Treat yourself this week.

I didn’t know how to say it.
“Who’s going to take care of him?” the vet asked again.
“I have no one,” I muttered. I could see my lonely pierce through her thick glasses—layer by layer—before scratching the cornea of her left eye, turning her brown into… Mustard?

I apologized to her. Silently, in my mind. I’m sorry, I whispered, hoping her eye would hear and forgive me.
She doesn’t need to know I’m crazy.

“You can leave him here until you get out.”
“Okay.”

• The Surgeon

Now I knew what to say: I have no one.
This time, I underlined it. 

She turned to me. All this time she’d been staring at the computer.
“I guess we can keep you here for one more day. Then you can take public transport home.”
“Okay.”

• The Anesthesiologist

Ask me! Ask me!
“In case of an urgent blood transfusion, are you willing to accept it?”
That’s not—
That’s not what I wanted you to ask.

“Whose blood is it?”
He looked down. I looked at his nametag. Trumpeteer, or something like that.

He laughed.
“Why are you laughing?”
“We don’t really know whose blood it is.” He smiled. “So I’ll just put down a ‘yes.’”
He scribbled yes.

I wasn’t done with this topic.
And I wasn’t joking either.
“Okay.”



• Angelika Kaffeebrenner

“Who is your emergency contact?”

I have no one.
Underlined. Bolded.

She turned to me. So much blue.
Blonde. Her shirt was blue. Her eyes were blue. Eyeliner—blue and bolded. Underlined. Just like my lonely by that point.

It made sense to me, that lonely would match blue. Linguistically, too.
I like when things make sense.

I felt like my lonely had reached its destination, and its name was Angelika Kaffeebrenner. Which, in German, translates to Angelika Coffee Burner (I’d say).
That also made sense. I hate coffee.
I drink it regularly, though.
But your breath stinks, your teeth turn yellow, and it’s just a poor person’s drink.

“So who’s going to pick you up after your surgery?”
“I’ll stay the night and leave the next day. The doctor said it’s fine.”

It’s fine, blue.
I wanted to fight her.
How do I fight blue?
Mustard.

Suddenly I remembered reading that Japan taxes its singles and child-frees.
She doesn’t look Japanese, though.
But it definitely felt like she was taxing me.
Personally.
I wonder how much they took from me.
Felt kinda cheap.

My friend, Matthew, had asked me to come over for the night to help him with a little “project” he had been working on for the last few weeks. Granted, I hadn’t seen him for those weeks so I assumed it must have been very personal for him so I agreed almost immediately. But as I stood there confused in my friend’s basement, staring down at the mass underneath a blanket laying on a table, I wish I didn’t.


“It’s what I've been working on.”


“And what you’ve been working on is?” I responded in an annoyed tone.


“Do you seriously not remember? We were watching that movie a few weeks ago and I said I was gonna try and do the same thing.” 


I narrowed my eyes at him, not entirely sure if Matt was messing with me or he really thinks I remembered a movie we watched weeks ago.


“No Matt, I don’t. How about you refresh my memory so I can better understand what the hell I’m looking at on your table.”


He let out a slight sigh. “We were watching those old horror movies and the one with the scientist and the monster came on? You made a joke about how it would be cool if someone could actually do that and I said I probably could if I had the time? Well, here it is.” He gave me a smile before looking down at the table. It took a moment for my mind to remember exactly what he was talking about. 


“Are you talking about Frankenstein?! I was high as shit that night. Why would you take anything I said with actual seriousne-“ I cut myself off as my gaze roamed over the mass, slowly recognizing the outline as a silhouette. 


“Matthew…what exactly is under this blanket?”


“It’s the monster from the movie.” He reached down and pulled the blanket back. “Well it’s the closest I could get. I’m no expert on this stuff.”


The best way I can describe what I saw was as Matt had said, The Monster from Frankenstein. Well it at least kinda looked like it. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the greenish hue that we know. Instead, it was a mix of skin tones with varying degrees of age and damage to each part; a busted up black forearm from a teen and a older looking white chest with scars on it just to name a few. The fingers on the right hand were mismatched, all different sizes and colors. The face was a mixed up jigsaw of at least 5 different people from what I could tell. 


I stared in horror at the unsightly creation laying on the table and without thinking, grabbed Matt’s shirt collar, pushing him against the nearest wall. 


“What in the FUCK did you do!?” I screamed as loud as my voice would allow me.


“W-What? I did what you said, I made the thing from the movie.” He looked at the table and then to me, hoping I would understand him. 


“Where the hell did you get these…things from?! Jesus Matt…did you-“ He cut me off before I could finish. “Christ of course not, I’m not a murderer dude. I've been getting them from the hospital.”


I stared at him, still in disbelief at what he had done. “You know how I've been working at the hospital for a while now? Well, when we would have accidental deaths or organ transplants going around, I would…take some stuff.” He smiled at me.


“Stuff?! This isn’t stuff man, this is parts of people!” I let go of his collar and started to pace around the room, covering that…thing back up with the blanket.


“Look, you said it would be cool if someone made the thing.” He held his hands out for me to look back at the table. “So I made it! Now I just gotta make it come to life somehow...” 


“Do you hear yourself right now? Do you hear how absolutely fucking insane you sound?! Make it come to life? That was a movie Matthew! It’s not real!”


“Oh well, I guess you don’t wanna help me then. Fine, you sit there and I’ll just finish up the rest.” He threw his arms down like a child having a tantrum. He pulled the blanket back on the corpse, leaving its head and upper chest exposed. He pulled out some nails from his pocket and started to push them into various areas of the rotting skin and tissue. I just stared in shock and disgust. How could my friend have done something like this? How could he be so nonchalant about all this? 


I took note of the rotten menagerie on the table as Matthew attached wires and cords to the nails. I stood up from my chair and walked towards the stairs to leave.


I slammed the basement door shut once I was upstairs and made my way to the front door. I could hear a storm starting up outside as the windows were hit with thick droplets of rain. Along with the rain I could hear footsteps running up from the basement as it flung open. 


“Where the hell are you going?” Matthew spoke in the doorway with deflating lungs. I turned to look at him just before I opened the door to leave.


“Home, Matt. I’m going home.”


“But why? I just finished putting the last wire in and the extension cord is all hooked up.”


“Matthew, listen to yourself. You’re crazy, those are pieces of dead people sitting on your basement coffee table! Do you really think a few strands of wire connected to an extension cord is gonna do anything?”


“But the movie…You said you wanted someone to do it?”


“Matt I know you're not that stupid, IT WAS A MOVIE FOR CHRIST SAKE! IT WASN’T REAL!”


Matt had an angered look in his eyes as he slammed the basement door and walked towards me.


“You know what, fuck you. I spent the past month and then some to get this ready for you and this is how you thank me?”


“Thank you? I should thank you for stealing dead people’s body parts?”


“I worked hard on this!”


“Yeah? And what are you gonna do when you power up the cord and nothing happens?”


I could hear the storm outside getting stronger. Heavy rain and cracks of thunder could be heard. I swore the shingles of the house were gonna get ripped off in an instant. 


“I don’t need this, just leave if you’re gonna be like this.” 


“I am and when your little experiment doesn’t work, don’t come calling me for help!”


Just then, the house was filled with the sound of thunder. It was deafening, louder than anything I had heard before. The living room lights flared up before you could hear the filaments inside them burst. Matt and I were now standing in the dark.


“Great, we’re both pissed and now the powers out.” Matt walked into the kitchen and started searching through the drawers.


I stood at the front door, the storm getting worse and worse outside. Soon, Matt walked up to me and handed me a flashlight. “Here, I’m gonna go mess with the breaker until it turns back on. When I get back we’re gonna have a real conversation about this.”


“I said I was leaving and that’s final.” I tried to hand him back the flashlight but he pushed my hand back.


“Please, just stay inside until I get back. The storm is getting worse and you can’t possibly drive in this.” Matt looked at me with a desperation in his eyes.


I had known Matt for almost 15 years. I knew he was a good man, but I also knew he was stupid. Here I was yelling when my friend, my best friend, needed serious help. I sighed as I looked at him.


“Fine”


Matt smiled at me before grabbing his coat from the hanger and moving past me to the front door.


“I’ll be right back.”


Matt opened the door and I could already feel the cold wind from the storm. The trees by his neighbor's house were close to being ripped up and flying away at this point. He nodded to me before closing the door behind him, leaving me alone in the house.


It had been 10 minutes and neither Matt nor the power was back. I was starting to get worried that he might have tripped outside on something and was now just laying in this storm. I went to the hanger to grab my jacket so I could go out and check on him when I heard something from downstairs in the basement. I turned my head towards the door and kept hearing what sounded like loud footsteps almost right beneath me. As quietly as I could, I made my way to the door and slowly pulled it open, standing face to face with the darkness below me.


I turned my flashlight on and pointed it down, shining it on the carpet by the bottom of the stairs. I could still hear the footsteps by this point, they sounded louder and more frantic but my line of sight remained clear of anything. I swallowed my fear and called out.


“Is anyone down there? Matt? Did you come back in through the hatch?”


Matthew’s basement, while finished, had an opening hatch that led to the backyard through a back room and some stairs. I assumed that maybe he was hurt and instead of trying to get back in through the front door he just went through the hatch. I slowly stepped deeper into the dark, my light moving up from the carpet and into the sitting area where me and Matt had been earlier that night. That’s when I saw the blanket on the floor and the empty table.


I could feel my heart stop for a moment as l stood there, staring down the barrel of this haunting reality. The corpse, that hulk of stitched body parts with nails and wires, was gone. So was the cord that connected it to an electrical box. The box was still there on the floor and I followed it’s cable to an outlet in the wall. When the electricity surged in the house…some of it must have found its way into “it”.


I continued to stare at the table until something caught my eye from the corners of darkness the flashlight could not reach. Just behind the wall leading to the back room, I could see the outline of a person. But the outline was wrong, so very wrong wrong. I quickly pointed the flashlight towards it and all I could see were the 5 distinct fingers moving back into the darkness. I let out a slight scream before I covered my mouth. 


Just then I could hear the front door swing open and then Matt’s voice following it. “The whole breaker is shot! I can’t fix it!” I didn’t respond, just stared in silence. Matt made his way to the basement door and stared down at me.


“Hey, what is it? Why are you down there?”


I swallowed what I could into my dry throat and looked up at him, slowly speaking.


“It’s down here, moving…”


Matt looked at me confused for a second before his eyes widened with a mix of excitement and terror. He silently looked at me and signaled to walk back up slowly. I nodded before slowly stepping up the stairs behind me. As I did, I could see the shadow of the thing move from its cover behind the wall and stare at me. 


Its eyes, two different shapes and colors stared at me as the flashlight pointed at it. Its shape was huge, taking up most of the light's space. It’s stitching leaked a mix of red blood and yellow bile from ripped veins. I could hear it breath and try to make sounds which came out as moans and grunts. With every step back I took, it took one closer to me. 


I was at the top of the stairs when it finally reached the bottom step. Once I was standing on the kitchen floor it started to walk up the steps towards us. I quickly slammed the door shut and all we heard was the loud slams and bangs from the other side, mixed with screams and grunts of both anger and confusion. We both looked at each other with mixed faces of horror and amazement. Matt’s creation was alive, it didn’t have a clue as to why it was here and it was angry.


I heard it almost tumble back down the steps as it made its way into the basement. I looked at Matt as he held his shaking hands. I locked the basement door slowly before stepping away towards Matt, grabbing his arm.


“We need to leave, now.” I quietly spoke to him, trying to keep my voice as low as I could so as to not alert the thing below us. He didn’t respond. Just stared at his hands while nodding. I didn’t know what Matt was thinking. Maybe he wasn’t thinking of anything and he was just in shock at seeing his creation walking around instead of laying lifeless on the table. Either way, I knew that we had to leave because that thing was getting more and more angry downstairs. I could hear it slamming and trashing everything down there. It tried to scream a few times to the best of its abilities but it just came out mumbled and wet.


“Matt, Now.” I grabbed his shoulder which seemed to snap him out of his trance. He nodded at me as we slowly made our way towards the front of the house. I was grabbing my car keys as we heard a crashing sound from below us. Then, silence. We looked at each other, waiting for the sounds to continue downstairs but it just stayed quiet. Then Matt’s face went whiter than it had been.


“The hatch…” he whispered. “I… did I lock it?


“You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me, Matt!” I snapped in a hushed tone. I took a deep breath, rubbing the bridge of my nose with shaky hands.“Ok…We just have to make it to my car and we should be fine…” 


I grabbed the door knob ready to swing it open but something in my gut stopped me. I got this sense of dread just from being close to the door. I let go of the knob and backed up slightly. Matt just stared at me, confused for a moment before it seemed he too got that same feeling. We both looked at the door and listened as we could hear the slight sound of harsh breathing from behind it.


Matt backed up more until he was standing in the open area of the living room. I just stayed, hoping I would hear the breathing distance itself from us but no luck. Occasionally I heard it push against the door, listening to the wood creak as if it was going to break in an instant. I turned to face Matthew to discuss what we could do when a hard pounding came from behind me. The thing was getting more restless. I could hear it screaming to the best of its abilities as the door took more and more hits. It got so loud it eventually drowned out the sound of the storm.


“Fuck! What the hell are we supposed to do?!” I started to pace around the room. The slams became harder as I could hear it become more enraged. Matt was looking down at his hands, fidgeting with them before he stood up and walked towards the kitchen. 


“Where are you going? Did you think of something?” I followed him towards the back of the house.


“Yeah, I’m gonna go out and distract it.”


“I’m sorry, what did you just say?”


“I’m gonna go out through the back door and get its attention. Then you can make a break for your car and get out of here.” Matthew sounded like he was struggling to get the last part of the plan out when he said it.


“Like hell you are? I’m not gonna let you go out there with that-“ He cut me off before I could finish.


“Look man, I’m the one who made you come over here. This was my stupid idea and it fucking backfired, so let me make it right by getting you out of here. Ok?”


I just looked at him as the pounding from the door got more and more difficult to drown out. I wanted to argue with him about it but I knew I couldn’t. My friend Matthew was many things but one thing he wasn’t was selfish. Nothing I said was gonna change his mind and I had to accept that. I pulled him into a hug without even thinking.


“You gotta promise me you’ll be ok, alright?” 


He chuckled before pulling away. “Of course man, who else are you gonna watch horror movies with?” We both laughed a bit before he made his way to the back door.


“You’re gonna hear when he leaves the door. Once he does, just book it to the car and go. I’ll call you once I’m safe.”


I nodded as he smiled at me and headed into the basement. A few moments later, I heard screaming outside from Matt. The pounding at the front door stopped and the monster grew quiet as the yelling made its way to the back of the house, slowly drifting away. Quickly, I pulled the door open and ran out towards the driveway, getting to my car before jumping in. I just stared at the house for a moment before turning on the ignition and speeding out of there.


I waited 3 days after that night for a phone call from Matt. Every second I was on edge as I expected either Matt or that thing to find me. I should have known I wasn’t gonna get a call from him but something inside me just hoped things would turn out ok. 


Last week, I got a call from Matt’s family telling me he was found dead in his house. The police got a call from neighbors about a noise complaint and when they went to check they found Matt in the basement. He was practically mutilated from what they told the family, not even letting them see the body after they got him out of there. It was ruled a murder but they couldn’t find any evidence of who could have done it as the scene was littered with different finger prints of deceased people.


But I know who did it, or more like what did it. Matt probably knew he wasn’t gonna make it out alive but it doesn’t make it any better knowing I have to live with the knowledge that he died for me. I know I should feel so guilty for everything. Matt created the monster and he was the one who came up with that plan, but… I couldn’t help but feel like it was all my fault. After all, I was the one who got him into horror movies in the first place. I also have to accept that it’s still out there. Who knows where it could be but I have a feeling that it’s looking for me. It’s watching me from afar, waiting to catch me off guard and do to me what it did to Matt. I just have to wait and listen for it. Listen for its breaths and moans of pain as it wonders and ask why it’s alive. As it wonders who made it and how it can get revenge for what they did.

I didn’t know what Matt was thinking. Maybe he wasn’t thinking of anything and he was just in shock at seeing his creation walking around instead of laying lifeless on the table. Either way, I knew that we had to leave because that thing was getting more and more angry downstairs. I could hear it slamming and trashing everything down there. It tried to scream a few times to the best of its abilities but it just came out mumbled and wet.


“Matt, Now.” I grabbed his shoulder which seemed to snap him out of his trance. He nodded at me as we slowly made our way towards the front of the house. I was grabbing my car keys as we heard a crashing sound from below us. Then, silence. We looked at each other, waiting for the sounds to continue downstairs but it just stayed quiet. Then Matt’s face went whiter than it had been.


“The hatch…” he whispered. “I… did I lock it?


“You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me, Matt!” I snapped in a hushed tone. I took a deep breath, rubbing the bridge of my nose with shaky hands.“Ok…We just have to make it to my car and we should be fine…” 


I grabbed the door knob ready to swing it open but something in my gut stopped me. I got this sense of dread just from being close to the door. I let go of the knob and backed up slightly. Matt just stared at me, confused for a moment before it seemed he too got that same feeling. We both looked at the door and listened as we could hear the slight sound of harsh breathing from behind it.


Matt backed up more until he was standing in the open area of the living room. I just stayed, hoping I would hear the breathing distance itself from us but no luck. Occasionally I heard it push against the door, listening to the wood creak as if it was going to break in an instant. I turned to face Matthew to discuss what we could do when a hard pounding came from behind me. The thing was getting more restless. I could hear it screaming to the best of its abilities as the door took more and more hits. It got so loud it eventually drowned out the sound of the storm.


“Fuck! What the hell are we supposed to do?!” I started to pace around the room. The slams became harder as I could hear it become more enraged. Matt was looking down at his hands, fidgeting with them before he stood up and walked towards the kitchen. 


“Where are you going? Did you think of something?” I followed him towards the back of the house.


“Yeah, I’m gonna go out and distract it.”


“I’m sorry, what did you just say?”


“I’m gonna go out through the back door and get its attention. Then you can make a break for your car and get out of here.” Matthew sounded like he was struggling to get the last part of the plan out when he said it.


“Like hell you are? I’m not gonna let you go out there with that-“ He cut me off before I could finish.


“Look man, I’m the one who made you come over here. This was my stupid idea and it fucking backfired, so let me make it right by getting you out of here. Ok?”


I just looked at him as the pounding from the door got more and more difficult to drown out. I wanted to argue with him about it but I knew I couldn’t. My friend Matthew was many things but one thing he wasn’t was selfish. Nothing I said was gonna change his mind and I had to accept that. I pulled him into a hug without even thinking.


“You gotta promise me you’ll be ok, alright?” 


He chuckled before pulling away. “Of course man, who else are you gonna watch horror movies with?” We both laughed a bit before he made his way to the back door.


“You’re gonna hear when he leaves the door. Once he does, just book it to the car and go. I’ll call you once I’m safe.”


I nodded as he smiled at me and headed into the basement. A few moments later, I heard screaming outside from Matt. The pounding at the front door stopped and the monster grew quiet as the yelling made its way to the back of the house, slowly drifting away. Quickly, I pulled the door open and ran out towards the driveway, getting to my car before jumping in. I just stared at the house for a moment before turning on the ignition and speeding out of there.


I waited 3 days after that night for a phone call from Matt. Every second I was on edge as I expected either Matt or that thing to find me. I should have known I wasn’t gonna get a call from him but something inside me just hoped things would turn out ok. 


Last week, I got a call from Matt’s family telling me he was found dead in his house. The police got a call from neighbors about a noise complaint and when they went to check they found Matt in the basement. He was practically mutilated from what they told the family, not even letting them see the body after they got him out of there. It was ruled a murder but they couldn’t find any evidence of who could have done it as the scene was littered with different finger prints of deceased people.


But I know who did it, or more like what did it. Matt probably knew he wasn’t gonna make it out alive but it doesn’t make it any better knowing I have to live with the knowledge that he died for me. I know I should feel so guilty for everything. Matt created the monster and he was the one who came up with that plan, but… I couldn’t help but feel like it was all my fault. After all, I was the one who got him into horror movies in the first place. I also have to accept that it’s still out there. Who knows where it could be but I have a feeling that it’s looking for me. It’s watching me from afar, waiting to catch me off guard and do to me what it did to Matt. I just have to wait and listen for it. Listen for its breaths and moans of pain as it wonders and ask why it’s alive. As it wonders who made it and how it can get revenge for what they did.

1ktpwao,https://www.reddit.com/r/B12_Deficiency/comments/1ktpwao/caffeine_sensitivity_completely_gone/,"""Caffeine sensitivity"" completely gone.","I have always been slightly caffeine sensitive. After black tea, I would experience a high and then a few hours later, jittery feeling, weakness and a headache that wasn't intense.

After coffee, I would get a terrible headache and some weakness. So I was never a coffee drinker.

The year before my B12 deficiency symptoms manifested seriously, I had changed from black tea, to green tea which had less caffeine/very little caffeine but eventually I got the same caffeine withdrawal symptoms I would get from black tea.

Even the caffeine in cocoa was triggering a response like as if I had taken a lot of black tea, this was when I had just started B12 treatment. I was even more ""caffeine sensitive"". 

And it would trigger massive panic attacks while taking methyl probably because they both can increase adrenaline, the 2 I experienced were the worst ever, I thought I was on teetering on the precipice of death throughout.

Thought it was genetic because my paternal uncle has the same issue, unlike my father who can drink black teas and coffees like a fish and in bigger amounts than usual for the antioxidants.

It's been almost 2 years since I stopped taking caffeine and continued with B12 treatment.

Well anyway, a few days ago I ordered from a restaurant and they added a complimentary cafe latte.

Anytime I see something with caffeine, I get a bit anxious. 

But I was curious to see if anything had changed, so I drank it and when I finished I was waiting for the withdrawal effects and panic attack but nothing happened minutes and even hours later, even the next day.

I have been drinking coffee and tea since and I don't feel any difference. Not even the common mild side effects.

A few times I did feel a bit of a high/excitement but it's been pretty even keel.

I had eaten a few coffee sweets a few months ago and still felt some withdrawal effects. I suspect increasing vit D may have something to do with the caffeine sensitivity going away.

Also, I noticed that the lunulae on my toes were coming back. My Dad who has no issue with caffeine has lunulae on all his fingers. I didn't have any before treating the deficiency.",3,1748022549.0,B12_Deficiency,0,1.0,False
1ktpw1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1ktpw1o/the_night_my_friend_made_life/,The Night My Friend Made Life,"“Matthew…What the hell is this?”


My friend, Matthew, had asked me to come over for the night to help him with a little “project” he had been working on for the last few weeks. Granted, I hadn’t seen him for those weeks so I assumed it must have been very personal for him so I agreed almost immediately. But as I stood there confused in my friend’s basement, staring down at the mass underneath a blanket laying on a table, I wish I didn’t.


“It’s what I've been working on.”


“And what you’ve been working on is?” I responded in an annoyed tone.


“Do you seriously not remember? We were watching that movie a few weeks ago and I said I was gonna try and do the same thing.” 


I narrowed my eyes at him, not entirely sure if Matt was messing with me or he really thinks I remembered a movie we watched weeks ago.


“No Matt, I don’t. How about you refresh my memory so I can better understand what the hell I’m looking at on your table.”


He let out a slight sigh. “We were watching those old horror movies and the one with the scientist and the monster came on? You made a joke about how it would be cool if someone could actually do that and I said I probably could if I had the time? Well, here it is.” He gave me a smile before looking down at the table. It took a moment for my mind to remember exactly what he was talking about. 


“Are you talking about Frankenstein?! I was high as shit that night. Why would you take anything I said with actual seriousne-“ I cut myself off as my gaze roamed over the mass, slowly recognizing the outline as a silhouette. 


“Matthew…what exactly is under this blanket?”


“It’s the monster from the movie.” He reached down and pulled the blanket back. “Well it’s the closest I could get. I’m no expert on this stuff.”


The best way I can describe what I saw was as Matt had said, The Monster from Frankenstein. Well it at least kinda looked like it. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the greenish hue that we know. Instead, it was a mix of skin tones with varying degrees of age and damage to each part; a busted up black forearm from a teen and a older looking white chest with scars on it just to name a few. The fingers on the right hand were mismatched, all different sizes and colors. The face was a mixed up jigsaw of at least 5 different people from what I could tell. 


I stared in horror at the unsightly creation laying on the table and without thinking, grabbed Matt’s shirt collar, pushing him against the nearest wall. 


“What in the FUCK did you do!?” I screamed as loud as my voice would allow me.


“W-What? I did what you said, I made the thing from the movie.” He looked at the table and then to me, hoping I would understand him. 


“Where the hell did you get these…things from?! Jesus Matt…did you-“ He cut me off before I could finish. “Christ of course not, I’m not a murderer dude. I've been getting them from the hospital.”


I stared at him, still in disbelief at what he had done. “You know how I've been working at the hospital for a while now? Well, when we would have accidental deaths or organ transplants going around, I would…take some stuff.” He smiled at me.


“Stuff?! This isn’t stuff man, this is parts of people!” I let go of his collar and started to pace around the room, covering that…thing back up with the blanket.


“Look, you said it would be cool if someone made the thing.” He held his hands out for me to look back at the table. “So I made it! Now I just gotta make it come to life somehow...” 


“Do you hear yourself right now? Do you hear how absolutely fucking insane you sound?! Make it come to life? That was a movie Matthew! It’s not real!”


“Oh well, I guess you don’t wanna help me then. Fine, you sit there and I’ll just finish up the rest.” He threw his arms down like a child having a tantrum. He pulled the blanket back on the corpse, leaving its head and upper chest exposed. He pulled out some nails from his pocket and started to push them into various areas of the rotting skin and tissue. I just stared in shock and disgust. How could my friend have done something like this? How could he be so nonchalant about all this? 


I took note of the rotten menagerie on the table as Matthew attached wires and cords to the nails. I stood up from my chair and walked towards the stairs to leave.


I slammed the basement door shut once I was upstairs and made my way to the front door. I could hear a storm starting up outside as the windows were hit with thick droplets of rain. Along with the rain I could hear footsteps running up from the basement as it flung open. 


“Where the hell are you going?” Matthew spoke in the doorway with deflating lungs. I turned to look at him just before I opened the door to leave.


“Home, Matt. I’m going home.”


“But why? I just finished putting the last wire in and the extension cord is all hooked up.”


“Matthew, listen to yourself. You’re crazy, those are pieces of dead people sitting on your basement coffee table! Do you really think a few strands of wire connected to an extension cord is gonna do anything?”


“But the movie…You said you wanted someone to do it?”


“Matt I know you're not that stupid, IT WAS A MOVIE FOR CHRIST SAKE! IT WASN’T REAL!”


Matt had an angered look in his eyes as he slammed the basement door and walked towards me.


“You know what, fuck you. I spent the past month and then some to get this ready for you and this is how you thank me?”


“Thank you? I should thank you for stealing dead people’s body parts?”


“I worked hard on this!”


“Yeah? And what are you gonna do when you power up the cord and nothing happens?”


I could hear the storm outside getting stronger. Heavy rain and cracks of thunder could be heard. I swore the shingles of the house were gonna get ripped off in an instant. 


“I don’t need this, just leave if you’re gonna be like this.” 


“I am and when your little experiment doesn’t work, don’t come calling me for help!”


Just then, the house was filled with the sound of thunder. It was deafening, louder than anything I had heard before. The living room lights flared up before you could hear the filaments inside them burst. Matt and I were now standing in the dark.


“Great, we’re both pissed and now the powers out.” Matt walked into the kitchen and started searching through the drawers.


I stood at the front door, the storm getting worse and worse outside. Soon, Matt walked up to me and handed me a flashlight. “Here, I’m gonna go mess with the breaker until it turns back on. When I get back we’re gonna have a real conversation about this.”


“I said I was leaving and that’s final.” I tried to hand him back the flashlight but he pushed my hand back.


“Please, just stay inside until I get back. The storm is getting worse and you can’t possibly drive in this.” Matt looked at me with a desperation in his eyes.


I had known Matt for almost 15 years. I knew he was a good man, but I also knew he was stupid. Here I was yelling when my friend, my best friend, needed serious help. I sighed as I looked at him.


“Fine”


Matt smiled at me before grabbing his coat from the hanger and moving past me to the front door.


“I’ll be right back.”


Matt opened the door and I could already feel the cold wind from the storm. The trees by his neighbor's house were close to being ripped up and flying away at this point. He nodded to me before closing the door behind him, leaving me alone in the house.


It had been 10 minutes and neither Matt nor the power was back. I was starting to get worried that he might have tripped outside on something and was now just laying in this storm. I went to the hanger to grab my jacket so I could go out and check on him when I heard something from downstairs in the basement. I turned my head towards the door and kept hearing what sounded like loud footsteps almost right beneath me. As quietly as I could, I made my way to the door and slowly pulled it open, standing face to face with the darkness below me.


I turned my flashlight on and pointed it down, shining it on the carpet by the bottom of the stairs. I could still hear the footsteps by this point, they sounded louder and more frantic but my line of sight remained clear of anything. I swallowed my fear and called out.


“Is anyone down there? Matt? Did you come back in through the hatch?”


Matthew’s basement, while finished, had an opening hatch that led to the backyard through a back room and some stairs. I assumed that maybe he was hurt and instead of trying to get back in through the front door he just went through the hatch. I slowly stepped deeper into the dark, my light moving up from the carpet and into the sitting area where me and Matt had been earlier that night. That’s when I saw the blanket on the floor and the empty table.


I could feel my heart stop for a moment as l stood there, staring down the barrel of this haunting reality. The corpse, that hulk of stitched body parts with nails and wires, was gone. So was the cord that connected it to an electrical box. The box was still there on the floor and I followed it’s cable to an outlet in the wall. When the electricity surged in the house…some of it must have found its way into “it”.


I continued to stare at the table until something caught my eye from the corners of darkness the flashlight could not reach. Just behind the wall leading to the back room, I could see the outline of a person. But the outline was wrong, so very wrong wrong. I quickly pointed the flashlight towards it and all I could see were the 5 distinct fingers moving back into the darkness. I let out a slight scream before I covered my mouth. 


Just then I could hear the front door swing open and then Matt’s voice following it. “The whole breaker is shot! I can’t fix it!” I didn’t respond, just stared in silence. Matt made his way to the basement door and stared down at me.


“Hey, what is it? Why are you down there?”


I swallowed what I could into my dry throat and looked up at him, slowly speaking.


“It’s down here, moving…”


Matt looked at me confused for a second before his eyes widened with a mix of excitement and terror. He silently looked at me and signaled to walk back up slowly. I nodded before slowly stepping up the stairs behind me. As I did, I could see the shadow of the thing move from its cover behind the wall and stare at me. 


Its eyes, two different shapes and colors stared at me as the flashlight pointed at it. Its shape was huge, taking up most of the light's space. It’s stitching leaked a mix of red blood and yellow bile from ripped veins. I could hear it breath and try to make sounds which came out as moans and grunts. With every step back I took, it took one closer to me. 


I was at the top of the stairs when it finally reached the bottom step. Once I was standing on the kitchen floor it started to walk up the steps towards us. I quickly slammed the door shut and all we heard was the loud slams and bangs from the other side, mixed with screams and grunts of both anger and confusion. We both looked at each other with mixed faces of horror and amazement. Matt’s creation was alive, it didn’t have a clue as to why it was here and it was angry.


I heard it almost tumble back down the steps as it made its way into the basement. I looked at Matt as he held his shaking hands. I locked the basement door slowly before stepping away towards Matt, grabbing his arm.


“We need to leave, now.” I quietly spoke to him, trying to keep my voice as low as I could so as to not alert the thing below us. He didn’t respond. Just stared at his hands while nodding. I didn’t know what Matt was thinking. Maybe he wasn’t thinking of anything and he was just in shock at seeing his creation walking around instead of laying lifeless on the table.

1ktpuqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/1ktpuqx/how_to_build_a_successful_startup_around_an_ios/,How to build a successful startup around an iOS app,"This topic is personal to me so I took the time to write this out in response to [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/1ktovo7/for_those_of_you_who_have_founded_a_ios_app_based/), but evidently the comment was too long. It seems relevant as I see lots more people, including myself going off by themselves to do something like this. As an experienced software engineer, found and investor, here's my 2¢:

Building a company takes much more than just coding a product, and the challenges you’re facing, creating something people want, reaching the right audience, and turning it into a sustainable business, are universal to entrepreneurship, whether you’re building an iOS app, a SaaS platform, or a physical product. As a founder, I’ve learned that success hinges on four key areas: deeply understanding your customers, building a product that solves their real problems, monetizing effectively, and positioning yourself where your audience can find you. Let’s break this down with practical advice from a founder’s perspective.

**1. Get to Know Your Customers Like They’re Your Best Friends**

You can’t build a successful product in a vacuum. The biggest mistake founders make is assuming they know what their customers want without actually talking to them. Your iOS app might have slick animations and flawless code, but if it doesn’t solve a burning problem for your target audience, it’s just a fancy toy.

* Start with conversations, not code. Before you write a single line, talk to at least 20–50 potential users. These could be friends, colleagues, or strangers in your target demographic. Ask open-ended questions: What’s the biggest frustration in \[the problem space\]? What tools do they currently use, and what’s missing? For example, if your app is a productivity tool, don’t just ask, “Would you use this?” Instead, ask, “How do you currently manage your tasks, and what drives you crazy about it?” These conversations reveal pain points you might not have considered.
* Build a feedback loop early. Once you have a minimum viable product (MVP), get it into the hands of real users as soon as possible. Use tools like TestFlight for iOS to distribute beta versions. Encourage honest feedback through in-app prompts or direct outreach. Offering small incentives when possible can also boost participation, like grandfathering early users into your app with lifetime premium access. Iterate based on what you hear and your users will guide you to the features that matter most.
* Create customer personas. Distill your findings into 2–3 detailed personas representing your core users. Give them names, jobs, goals, and pain points. For instance, “Sarah, a 30-year-old freelance designer, struggles to track project deadlines across multiple clients.” Refer to these personas when making product decisions to stay focused on real needs.

As a founder, your job is to be obsessed with your customers’ problems. This isn’t an iOS-specific skill—it’s the foundation of any successful company, from Airbnb to a local coffee shop.

**2. Build a Product That Solves a Real Problem**

A great app isn’t defined by its tech stack or polish; it’s defined by how much value it delivers. Too many founders (myself included, early on) get caught up in building features they think are cool instead of features customers will need, appreciate or pay for.

* Focus on the “job to be done.” Customers don’t buy apps; they hire them to solve specific problems. Ask yourself, “What job is my user hiring this app to do?” For example, Duolingo isn’t just a language-learning app; it’s hired to make learning fun and accessible for busy people. Strip your app down to the core features that address this job.
* Launch an MVP fast. Don’t spend six months perfecting your app. Aim to launch a functional MVP in 2–3 months or even less with help from modern AI tools. For an iOS app, this might mean a basic version with a more valuable feature, clean design, and no major bugs. The sooner you launch, the sooner you’ll learn what resonates.
* Prioritize ruthlessly. Use a framework like the MoSCoW method (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have) to decide what features make the cut. Must-haves are non-negotiable for solving the core problem. Everything else can wait. I've wasted months building features I thought were cool that nobody cared about.

This applies to any business: whether you’re coding an app or opening a bakery, your product must deliver undeniable value. The platform (iOS, web, or otherwise) is just a means to an end.

**3. Monetize by Aligning with Customer Value**

For a company to be successful, monetization usually can't be an afterthought, it’s a core part of your strategy. The good news? If your app solves a real problem, customers will be willing to pay. The trick is choosing a model that aligns with how your users perceive value.

* Explore multiple models. Common options for iOS apps include:
   * Subscriptions: Best for apps with ongoing value (e.g., fitness trackers, productivity tools). Offer a free tier or trial to hook users, then charge monthly/yearly. For example, Notion uses subscriptions to deliver continuous updates and cloud syncing.
   * In-app purchases: Great for apps with premium features or consumables (e.g., extra lives in games). Be clear about what’s free vs. paid to avoid frustrating users.
   * One-time purchases: Works for apps with a clear, standalone value (e.g., a niche utility like a pro-level calculator). Apple’s 30% cut hurts less here, but you’ll need a strong upfront pitch.
   * Freemium: Combine free access with paid upgrades. This lowers the barrier to entry but requires a compelling premium offering. Dropbox nailed this by offering free storage with paid tiers for more space.
   * Ads: Viable for high-engagement apps (e.g., games), but use sparingly, intrusive ads hurt user retention. Consider rewarded ads (e.g., watch an ad for a bonus feature) to keep users happy.
* Test pricing early. Don’t guess or just decide what users will pay, experiment. Launch with a price (e.g., $4.99/month) and A/B test variations. Tools like RevenueCat can simplify in-app purchase testing on iOS.
* Communicate value clearly. Your App Store listing and onboarding flow should scream why the paid version is worth it. Highlight outcomes, not features. Instead of “Unlock custom themes,” say “Personalize your workflow to save time every day.”

Monetization isn’t an iOS problem, it’s a business problem. The same principles apply to selling software, services, or physical goods: understand what your customers value and make it easy for them to pay for it.

**4. Get Noticed by Being Where Your Customers Are**

The App Store is a crowded marketplace, with over 2 million apps competing for attention. But visibility isn’t just about App Store Optimization (ASO), it’s about showing up where your customers already hang out. This is true for any company, whether you’re selling apps, clothing, or consulting.

* Master App Store Optimization (ASO). Since you’re on iOS, ASO is table stakes. Use keyword-rich titles and subtitles, but keep it natural because Apple penalizes keyword stuffing. Write a compelling description that focuses on user benefits. Invest in high-quality screenshots and a demo video because users judge apps in seconds. Tools like AppTweak or Sensor Tower can help analyze keywords and competitors.
* Go beyond the App Store. Most users won’t find you through search alone. Identify where your target audience spends time and meet them there:
   * Communities: Engage in relevant Reddit threads (e.g., r/productivity for a task app), Discord servers, or niche forums. Don’t spam. Take the time to offer value by answering questions or sharing insights.
   * Content marketing: Create blog posts, YouTube tutorials, or TikToks that address your audience’s pain points. For example, if your app helps with meal planning, post “5 Hacks to Plan Healthy Meals in 10 Minutes.” Include a call-to-action linking to your app.
   * Social media and influencers: Share behind-the-scenes content on Twitter/X or Instagram to build a following. Partner with micro-influencers (1,000–10,000 followers) in your niche if they’re affordable and trusted.
   * Paid ads: Experiment with Apple Search Ads for targeted App Store traffic. Start with a small budget ($50/week) and optimize based on cost-per-install. For broader reach, try Google Ads or Meta Ads, but only after validating your audience targeting.
* Leverage partnerships. Collaborate with complementary apps or businesses. For example, if your app is a workout tracker, partner with a fitness blog to cross-promote. These deals can be as simple as mutual shoutouts or as formal as revenue-sharing agreements.

Getting noticed isn’t about gaming the App Store algorithm, it’s about building a presence in your customers’ world. This is true for any business: a restaurant needs foot traffic, a SaaS needs inbound leads, and an app needs eyeballs.

**Final Thoughts**

Building a successful iOS app COMPANY isn’t just about mastering Swift or nailing the UI, it’s about solving real problems for real people and turning that into a sustainable business. The challenges of understanding customers, creating value, monetizing, and gaining visibility are the same whether you’re coding an app, launching a startup, or selling handmade crafts. My biggest piece of advice? Start small, listen to your users, and iterate relentlessly. Every successful founder I know has stumbled, learned, and pivoted their way to success. You don’t need a perfect app, you need a perfect understanding of your customer.",1,1748022443.0,iOSProgramming,4,0.6,False

The final four retreat to the sanctuary of the luxury suite after the callout and bottom three reveal. Lily’s face beams with pure joy, her heart soaring as she struggles to believe she’s genuinely safe—spared from the pain of being in the bottom three. Meanwhile, the other three are cloaked in bitter jealousy, their eyes burning with longing and frustration as they desperately yearn to join her in the finale and to prove they’re stronger, better, deserving of victory. The ache in their souls is palpable—they crave that spotlight in the finale, to be part of the final two, to have that triumph that Lily hass so unexpectedly attained with just having been declared a finalist and getting her first 1st callout in the game. Freja is happy for her best friend in the house but secretly she is very jealous. She hopes to join her friend and beat her in the grand finale.

Lily is inside making sandwiches for the girls in the kitchen. On the balcony, the bottom three models gather close, their voices hushed as they sip coffee and tea, anxiety twisting inside them. 

Maria’s voice trembles with raw fear, her words bleeding with doubt and vulnerability. “I’m terrified I won’t recover from this… from back-to-back fails that feel like crushing defeats,” she confesses, her face shadowed by a storm of uncertainty and heartbreak. 

Freja’s eyes burn with conviction as she reaches out, her voice filled with fierce support. “I get it. Being at the bottom twice in a row—it’s like the world’s just trying to break you down. But listen—this isn’t over. One of us three still has a shot at reaching the finale. You have a strong portfolio, Maria. You could still be a finalist. It isn't over yet.”

Maria’s voice trembles as she fights to find hope. “You’re right. There’s still a chance. My portfolio’s strong but so is yours—and Iris’s. We’re all fighting to stay alive in this game.”

Iris’s voice cuts in, filled with a mix of frustration and disbelief. “It’s crazy, isn’t it? Lily’s had four bottom three spots—yet she’s the one heading to the finale. How is that fair?”

Freja responds, her tone measured but firm. “Actually, last week there was only a bottom two. No bottom three then.”

Iris counters passionately, eyes blazing. “Last week, she was second out of four—so by that logic, she was basically in the bottom three. Four weeks in a row—she’s like Crystal 2.0. It’s not right that she gets to go to the finale first.”

Freja’s voice softens with admiration as she defends Lily. “But she’s shown so much strength throughout this game in spite of her multiple bottom appearances—she dominated the early weeks, won immunity twice in bottom three, booked two out of four go-sees last week. She’s earned her spot. And she crushed it during the last photoshoot. Her late first 1st callout? It's deserved in my opinion. She's earned her spot. I'm jealous she's in the finale instead of me cause I wanna be guaranteed safety but at the same time I am happy fo her. She's come a long way.”

Maria’s voice wavers, touched by her friend’s loyalty. “You’re such a good friend to her… Honestly, I forgot she was even real competition with how much she stayed in the bottom middle of this cycle. But she did do really strong this week.”

Freja nods, her voice fierce with hope. “She’s a fighter. She’s resilient. She could really go all the way—and win this.”

Iris scoffs, a bitter edge in her voice. “I doubt it. She might be the underdog story but I think she’ll end up as the runner-up. Our portfolios are stronger—she doesn’t deserve a spot in the finale. Not beyond third place, at best. Whichever one of us ends up in the finale will beat her. Freja, you gonna tell her what I said?”

Freja shrugs, noncommittal. “Does it matter?”

Iris’s tone sharpens, tinged with annoyance. “Honestly, I don’t care. Say what you want. She might even swing back into the cycle’s villainess role if she hears my words.”

Freja’s voice pivots, with just a hint of challenge. “Maybe you’re just envious of her, Iris. She's guaranteed a spot in the finale while we’re stuck fighting in the bottom three for the last finalist spot.”

Maria interrupts, her voice trembling with weariness. “Can we just try to stay calm before this challenge? I’m already stressed beyond measure. I don’t need more drama right now. I'm so sick of all the drama of this season.”

Iris exhales sharply. “Fine. I admit—I am jealous. I believe I deserve to be in the finale and I wish one of you were in it with me. I’ll do whatever it takes to make sure I get there.”

Freja offers a determined smile. “May the best woman win that second finalist spot.”

Suddenly, Lily appears on the balcony, tray of gluten-free veggie sandwiches in hand, her smile warm. “Hey, ladies. Lunch is ready. Hope you like the veggie sandwiches. This gluten free bread is amazing.”

Freja’s tone cuts through the moment, blunt and honest. “Iris said you don’t deserve to be in the finale.”

Lily’s eyes flicker with quiet resolve. She locks eyes with Iris. “I knew you’d say that. It’s fine. The public loved me—I’m in the finale. No one can take that away.”

Iris scoffs, dismissive. “You’ve been bottom three four weeks in a row—your spots not earned. That's my opinion.”

Lily snaps back, annoyed. ""Actually, it was only three times—I wasn’t bottom last week. There was no bottom three. Only bottom two.”

Iris challenges sharply. “In my book, second out of four still places you in the bottom three—so it counts. Whatever. If I make it to the finale, I’ll win and beat you. It'll be super easy honestly. I don't see you as my strongest competition.”

Lily smirks, unwavering. “Good luck beating Maria and Freja. They’re fierce contenders with first callouts too.”

Iris, bitter, gets up, voice strained. “I’ve lost my appetite. I’m going to practice poses in front of the mirror. Lily, I swear—I’ll beat you. I’m a better model and you know it.”

Lily’s grin widens. “Have fun practicing, bitch.”

Iris rolls her eyes, storming inside. Maria looks between Lily and Freja, her voice gentle yet pleading. ""She's just stressed. Cut her some slack please. You shouldn't call her a bitch.""

""Well, she's being one. I deserve my spot. I earned it. And she's disliked me ever since I flipped out at Missy for throwing my chicken away. I could always feel a negative energy from her. I hope one of you makes it to the finale instead of her,"" Lily responds. ""Now let's enjoy our sandwiches before they get too cold.""

Inside the quiet sanctuary of the bathroom, Iris stood trembling, her reflection staring back at her as she practiced her poses. Suddenly, tears burst from her eyes, streaming down her face in silent anguish. Fear gripped her soul—she was desperately afraid she wouldn’t make it to the finale and the thought of losing her dream shattered her heart into pieces. Winning this meant everything to her; it was the culmination of endless sacrifices, relentless hope and unwavering belief. The looming possibility of it slipping away haunted her, threatening to crush her spirit in an instant. She fought to summon her courage, telling herself she had to outshine the others, to rise above the doubts and fears that threatened to drown her. Her heart ached deeply for Maria, who was also in the bottom three—in her mind it was supposed to be the two of them together going to the finale. That's how she pictured it. But that wasn't going to be the reality. That dream of being in the finale with her close pal had crumbled before her eyes. She had to let go of that dream of being there with Maria and focus only on herself at this point moving forward. With a trembling breath, Iris steadied herself, wiping away the tears, her resolve burning brighter than ever. ""You got this,"" she whispered fiercely to her reflection. ""You cannot let that annoying bitch Lily take everything from you. And I'm sorry Maria, I love you but I have to beat you. You've got this Iris, you're gonna kill it.""

Soon the bottom three contestants—alongside Lily—made their way to the studio where Lindsay awaited with a warm, encouraging smile. ""Hello lovely ladies!"" she greeted with genuine excitement. ""Congratulations once again to Lily for reaching the finale! Now I know you’re probably wondering why Lily is here even though she’s already safe. Well today is an extraordinary day for her—because she’s not only the first finalist to secure her spot in the grand finale but today marks a moment that will be another milestone for her."" Her eyes sparkled as she continued passionately, ""Today, the photoshoots aren’t just about images—they’re about dreams coming true. Lily will be shooting advertisements for Mio Yoshie, a stunning Japanese makeup brand known for its high-quality products in sleek and minimalist packaging. And here's the thrill—these images will be a real ad campaign for the brand, not a mock one! She'll be modeling both a lipstick and a mascara as well for Mio Yoshie and she’ll be compensated for this incredible opportunity. Lily, this is your moment—your time to shine brighter than ever. Congratulations on this opportunity! I bet the rest of you are really wishing you got this first callout as it's the most important one besides winning.""

Lily erupted into joyful cheers, her heart pounding with happiness. Freja gently patted her back in sincere support while Maria and Iris exchanged glances—bitterness and envy clouding their eyes. Maria struggled to mask her jealousy, pretending to smile for Lily’s triumph, but beneath her façade, a flicker of envy burned brightly.

Then Lindsay’s voice rang with a mix of challenge and encouragement. ""The bottom three will also be doing mascara and lipstick ads that won't be part of the real ad campaign. These pictures will be ranked from best to worst. The scores—combined with votes from Dolls and Incognito—will determine which of you will join Lily in the finale. Today’s results are everything. So give it your all—this day could be the day that will lead to your dreams coming true. You three don't get the ad campaign with Mio Yoshie but you three still have a shot at winning this competition and getting a cover and spread in Vogue Paris, campaigns with Chanel and the million dollars. Don't screw it up today. And congratulations once more to Lily for landing this incredible campaign with Mio Yoshie! I can’t wait to see these images!""

The models got into hair and makeup and worked it at the campaign shoot. Let's see Lily's shots for the beauty campaign for Mio Yoshie.

1ktptqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ktptqt/soy_milk_spoiled/,Soy Milk: Spoiled,"

I locked Soy Milk in the drawer as I said I would. I rolled up an old hoodie, stuffed it around the doll, and shoved it deep enough that the drawer creaked when I closed it. Then I took an old belt and wrapped it around the handles because that was how far my logic had come.

That was about ten hours ago.

I left the apartment to clear my head. I walked aimlessly, bought a coffee I did not drink, and returned home after dark. The drawer was still closed. The belt was still in place. But something felt off; the quiet was heavier than usual.

I went to bed early, completely drained. I turned off my screens and sat in darkness with only blackout curtains and the hope that it was over.

That night I dreamed I could not move. Not in the familiar way of sleep paralysis but simply like I had been sewn into place. I felt thread pulling through my arms and my chest, gently tightening me until I was completely still. My mouth was set and my jaw ached, while my fingers felt as if they had been stuffed with cotton.

When I woke up, I noticed red indentations across my hands. Three faint lines trailed from my palm to the tip of my middle finger as if something had tugged from beneath my skin.

That was this morning.

I did not hesitate. I pulled Soy Milk from the drawer, still bundled in the hoodie, and dropped it into a shoebox. I zip-tied the lid and then duct-taped it securely. I shoved the whole thing into the closet and sat on the kitchen floor, watching the empty space until the sun came up.

When I checked the box again, the zip ties were intact. The tape was undisturbed. However, the doll was not inside.

It was in the microwave. Balanced upright, right where I had been staring.

I did not scream or even swear. I just laughed until my voice cracked. It was as if I had reached a point where the horror became absurd.

By noon, I posted on a local collectibles board: “Unboxed Macaron variant, free to a good home. Pickup only.”

I received a reply in under twenty minutes. The user had no profile picture and no name, only a message:

> “I have been looking for that one.”



I left the doll on a bench in the park down the street. I placed it in a paper bag with no note and watched from a distance until someone picked it up and walked away without a glance.

I returned home. I slept.

That was a few hours ago. I feel oddly light tonight, as if I had been holding tension in parts of me I never knew existed. I ate for the first time in a day. I did not check the drawer. I did not feel the urge.

But just now, as I write this, I opened my camera roll to review the last photo I took during my walk. There was a picture I do not remember taking.

It is blurry and dark, shot from a low angle, and it shows my bed from a perspective I have never seen. In that image, I am lying down, facing away from the camera, and smiling in my sleep.

I live alone.

I am not sure what it means. I thought I had passed it on for good. But now the silence speaks otherwise.",6,1748022376.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I’m a proud Auntie to a niece who will be starting her medical residency this fall at Northwestern in Pediatrics. I want to gift her an amazing gift. Some personalized items and some things that are  practical and valuable for the journey ahead, so I’m putting together a ""survival kit."" My goal is to include items that aren’t cliche but will be genuinely useful and appreciated on a day-to-day basis. I want to get things that no one else would think of. I want the kit to be a mix of big and small items, with some personalized touches when possible. I’m still in the early stages and have mostly surface-level ideas, so I’m looking for suggestions on what else to include that she might not even realize she’ll need but will truly appreciate.

Here are some gift ideas I’ve thought of so far:

* Coffee mug with lid 
* Starbucks gift card
* Uber Eats gift cards
* Good quality writing pens (no cap—any recommendations?)
* Comfortable scrubs (I'm unsure if she needs a gift card to get these herself—are there specific colors for Northwestern pediatrics? I want to pick the most comfortable brand)
* Convertible clipboards (great for on-the-go note-taking)

\------------------

  
A bit of backstory for those who would enjoy reading :)

  
She and I met back in high school when I was 16 and she was 14.  We were pretty young but it was love at first sight, and we were compatible with each other in every way. 

The problems started to arrise couple of months in, she would be questioning everything she felt or didnt feel about me. She would treat me like shit for 2 weeks and she would be in a bad mood, but since she was like this about everything and everyone, from friendships, school to family, for me it was simply a part of her. She was the questioning type. She was kinda fighting with herself constantly, always thinking that somebody is out to get her, she deserves more and better, her friends are terrible, I am terrible, she feels empty about everything and everyone, including me and so on. But we talked about it, I was there with here, and I also gave her space when I noticed she needed it, and I accepted her as she was, just as she accepted me with all my faults.

So we went on, every couple of months she'd come into a phase like mentioned above, I would try and be supportive as much as possible, but it fucking hurt having to listen to the person who you love the most, tell you she isnt sure if she loved you. I would give her space during this time, I was never clingy, but was supportive, and I kinda understood it, since I had the same feelings myself sometimes, but I never gave that so much thought. On the other hand, she was the type of person if we were to go out on an amazing date, and do stuff together whole day, and 2 seconds of that day werent good, she would paint the whole day black and all of a sudden everything was terrible in her head, that whole day sucked and the day stayed like that in her memory... 

But still after couple of weeks of the bad phase  she would be head over heels for me again, telling me how much she loved me and how she felt bad for how she treated me before that. Sometimes these bad phases wouldnt come up for 1-2 years, but each time they came and lasted longer, and it felt like they came with interest on top, compounding all those bad phases from the past ... So after about 5 years of our relationship, I ended it, because I wanted her to find someone she would love, and just wanted her to be happy because I had felt it wasn't me apparently.



Couple of months later, it seemed we both kinda moved on, I met someone I fell in love with, and started to date again. We dated for 3-4 months and my at the time ex, started messaging me constantly, telling how she was wrong, how she made a mistake and now was sure about us and couldnt live without me, and after some time of this we got back together and it seemed everything got better.  Some time after that, everything being as great as it could, basically all the good stuff with no bad phases from before, we got married and she got pregnant directly after. Life looked great, I was 23 at the time, had my own small agency, the future looked amazing.



BUT as life gets, 2 weeks before the birth of my son, doctors discovered my dad had stage 4 cancer. He lived in a different country for work, and was alone there since he and my mom divorced when I was 16. I decided then and there to divide my time, 2 weeks per month I would be with my dad in a country 1500km away, 2 weeks with my wife and newborn son. I hoped my dad would get better, i didnt even understand what stage 4 meant... This went on for 6 months, traveling back and forth, not being able to work since I was always away, managing living in 2 different places in the world, taking care of my wife and kid, taking care of my father. I talked to my wife, and we decided to move to where my dad lived so he could move in with us and we could be there for him and with him.



So we did all that, I gave everything up, moved out of the penthouse we were renting and we moved into a shitty apartment, the only one I could find near the hospital where my dad was, gave up the agency, and moved to I country where I didnt know anyone except my dad, didnt know the language, and had to start from 0. I didnt care, I knew I would manage and find ways to support us all.



I did, I managed to find a job really fast, however, 2 months after we moved, my dad passed away, being only 48 years old. Since we were there already, whe thought, lets give this new place a show and see how it would be.



Fast forrward to future, my wife has started having these phases again after all that stress back then, and is now questioning everything even more, and lately we have reached a point where I have just simply gotten over her. It wasnt up to her anymore. Before that I was always kinda waiting for her good phase to come, which always did after the bad questioning one was over, but now I dont care anymore.



It all reached a point where I told here, its not up to her anymore, and that I cant be with someone and continue giving 120% and only be getting love in installments back. So we have decided to separate, and I dont plan on making the same mistake I did back then where we got back together. She is a good person, but its obvious I am causing her pain by loving her. It would make me happy for her to find someone where she will be 100% sure, I just hope she doesnt fall back and then constantly be thinking if she made a mistake with me, when she meets someone new and them to have that person be in a similar situation like I was in.



However now the following problem, I dont even know how to date anymore... I dont even know how to flirt, how to date, like where do you meet new people, how do you connect with somebody? Do you like just approach someone you like, and try and ask them out on a cup of coffee? I feel like I was in prison for the past 30 years and now have to figure out how blockchain works haha Theoretically my chances of finding someone should be good on paper, but in the last couple of months where I started actively ""checking"" out other people, I never noticed anyone being interested in me. Now I am not even sure if I am so blunt and cant see these things or they simply arent happening. How do you even know if someone is flirting with you or they are just being nice and polite? How do you flirt without coming off as creep? I dont know any of this and it kinda feels like I missed too much. For the past 14 years I never cared about other people, I was married and had no interest in other women. But now it seems all that has made me blunt, and it feels like I am using a spoon to chop down a tree.



So long story short, I assume many of you were or are in a similar situation, so do you have any tips on all of this on how to move on, where to find new people, do you use any apps, how to avoid scams in online chats and stuff like that. Not even sure at this point why I wrote so much back story to all of this I think I just wanted to share in a way since I have nobody to talk to, so sorry for trauma dumping. I dont even know how I was able to take this for so long to think of it, but I guess I always put my feelings in second place. 



Looking forward for any tips tricks or advice

I am exactly the same weight down to the decimal as 1 week ago. I think it’s because I’ve been fairly constipated, compared to my former very regular schedule. Especially since I’ve been drinking less coffee lol.

1ktpql9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ktpql9/complain_post_about_the_office_espresso_machine/,Complain post about the office espresso machine,"I work in a small office of 10 employees. I was tasked to find a superautomatic espresso machine for work. I was told our CEO wants a one-button push cappuccino machine. He also wants to be able to have decaf and regular drinks. Our requirement was easy to clean, and didn't necessarily have to be cleaned after each use. We settled on the Jura J8 Twin. It requires a milk cooler to really be a one-button push cappuccino machine. Right before I went to buy it, I was told not to buy the milk cooler by the controller (even though it was already approved by the CEO). My thought is, we are already spending $3,500, why not spend another $300? But, ok, if that's what you want to do.

The machine comes in. I set it up. I purchase some locally roasted beans. I was honestly really impressed with the quality of espresso I got out of it. However, some of the employees didn't care for the espresso. This particular roaster's beans do have a unique flavor to them. Once we were close to running out, I asked the controller to go purchase a different roaster's beans. I was instructed to go to Walmart to see if Peet's had any coffee beans we could use. I mentioned it would be fun to try all the local roasters around, but they would like to see if Peet's has some.

When I got to Walmart, I called and told them only Starbucks and another company had espresso beans. They then asked me to get a bag of Starbucks medium roast beans. I tried to explain that it wouldn't really be espresso, but they just wanted to try it. I told them I was at least getting some espresso beans too.

When I got back, the controller immediately filled the hopper with the medium roast beans before we were even finished with the local ones, so we didn't know when the beans switched over. I made myself a latte on it and I could barely taste the coffee. The controller and another coworker seem content with it. I think it's because they are essentially making a cup of coffee with an espresso machine. I'm pretty sure they have the water volume set very high.

Now, I am not an espresso aficionado. I dabble enough to make a decent latte at home with my little Bambino and Capresso grinder. But, this whole process has made me so frustrated. Why spend this much money if we aren't going to use it as intended? I'm tempted to bring in my old coffee pot for them to use.

Am I wrong here? Idk. Maybe I'm just frustrated because I spent so much time trying to find the right machine for the office and it is being used differently than I pictured (when I definitely had actual work I should have been working on).

Also, the CEO and I have been on different business trips since we got the machine, so I haven't had the time to see what he likes or doesn't like about it.

I get it’s just nice and he knows I don’t do well financially, and especially I wax for him because I want to. However, I just like it if he just sends me the money and leaves a note saying “this is for your appointment.” He did this before with coffee when I said I was having a stressful day and I felt really happy since he just did it without asking me.

I just want him to do whatever he thinks is nice to do. He doesn’t need to pay for anything at all, but it means a lot if he surprises me and covers for stuff since it comes more from the heart.

1ktpnxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1ktpnxq/any_tips_for_fasting_on_a_road_trip/,Any tips for fasting on a road trip?,"Looking for some suggestions on how to stay on track while driving across the country. I'll be on the road to my destination for 4 days, staying for a couple weeks, and then I'll have another 4 days driving back. I'll be traveling with my 3 kids, alongside my sister and her kids. 

I've been fasting for several months now (actually, on and off for several years, but I'm *finally* sticking with it, and I'm SO proud of myself, and I don't want to ruin it 😭). I've recently lost 40 lbs. I've got another 30 or so to go, and I really don't want to fall back into my old habits. I've found that the key, for me, is to STICK WITH IT. It's so easy to do if I just remain consistent with it, but as soon as I deviate or take a ""cheat"" break, it's incredibly hard to get back to it. 

I typically do OMAD, around lunchtime, supplemented with a generous mug of coffee with sugar-free creamer in the morning (again, 3 kids, lol -- it may be considered dirty fasting, but it works for me, and that cup of coffee makes this lifestyle sustainable). 

My sister has done most of the planning for this trip. As far as food goes, we're having breakfast at the hotel each morning, packing stuff for sandwiches in the cooler for lunch and snacks for the kids throughout the day, and then stopping for dinner in the evenings when we reach the hotel.

I want to make myself a solid plan so I have something to stick to, and I'd love some help from folks who've done this before. I plan on having my morning coffee at the hotel, with my sugar-free creamer, as usual.

After that, I really want to limit myself to one meal. So either I can pack something in the cooler to eat for lunch with the kids, or I can wait until dinner and eat with them then. I'm leaning more towards eating at lunchtime, since that's what I'm used to, and I really don't want to run out of steam on the ~8-hour drive each day, especially with my kiddos in the car. Don't want to take any chances of falling asleep. So, if you've read this far, I guess this is what I'm needing:

- Suggestions for something I can pack in the cooler that will be filling and nutrient-dense to eat around lunchtime that will sustain me for the entire day (looking to stay between 700-1,000 calories). Preferably something I can eat while driving.

*or*

- Suggestions on how to make it through an 8-hour drive without eating. I usually chug water all day, but we'll have limited bathroom breaks to work with. I thought about having a large coffee to slowly sip on, but I tend to get really antsy if I have more than one mug in the morning on an empty stomach.

I'm a bit of a homebody, and I'm comfortable in my routine. So any input from travelers who've dealt with this issue before would be greatly appreciated!

Also, I'd gladly welcome any tips on how to stay strong while visiting my food-centric Italian family. 😄

Well flash forward to today, almost 2 months in to keppra now. My grandmother who raised me passed away April 30th. It’s been a horrible first couple months to the year with my seizures increasing prior to Keppra and lots of caretaking and grief. My partner’s health, my dad’s health, and mine. When it rains it pours type shit. Her memorial service was on this Sunday and I’ve disassociated quite a bit since as I feel the grief slowing sneaking up on me. This morning I wake up, fragile as can be, and an argument with my partner turns into full blown rage. I smash our glass coffee table with whatever was lying next to me and it shatters and shards of glass fly up into my arm. I’m humiliated. I’m embarrassed. I’m even gaslighting myself into somehow not dumping this all on keppra and I’m just a fucking horrible person with no emotional control. Idk. My partner wanted to leave at points, even argued back and forth with me when I clearly wasn’t in a good mental state, then we went to urgent care to get the glass taken out. I’m just feeling so many emotions afterwards. Shame, guilt, shock, confusion, feeling judged, feeling alone. And I just wanted some support if anyone at all can try and help me navigate this.

1ktpn9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Wellsness93/comments/1ktpn9h/30day_weight_loss_diet_plan_challenge/,30-Day Weight Loss Diet Plan Challenge,"# 30-Day Weight Loss Diet Plan Challenge

This 30-day challenge combines a balanced, calorie-controlled diet with your daily 7–8 km walking routine to promote sustainable weight loss. The goal is to lose 2–4 kg (4–9 lbs) over 30 days by creating a daily calorie deficit of \~500–750 calories through diet and exercise. Adjust portions based on your specific calorie needs (consult a dietitian for precision).

# Challenge Guidelines

1. **Calorie Deficit**: Aim for a 500–750 calorie deficit daily. Your 7–8 km walk burns \~300–500 calories, so reduce food intake by \~200–400 calories below maintenance (e.g., \~1,500–1,800 calories for most adults, depending on weight, age, and activity).
2. **Macronutrient Balance**: Target 25–30% protein, 40–45% carbs, and 25–30% fats to stay full and support muscle maintenance.
3. **Hydration**: Drink 8–10 cups (2–2.5 liters) of water daily. Start meals with a glass of water to curb overeating.
4. **Meal Timing**: Eat 3 meals and 1–2 snacks daily, spaced 3–4 hours apart, to stabilize blood sugar and reduce cravings.
5. **Mindful Eating**: Chew slowly, avoid distractions (e.g., TV), and stop when 80% full.
6. **Track Progress**: Log food, weight, and measurements weekly. Use an app (e.g., MyFitnessPal) or journal. Celebrate non-scale victories (e.g., better energy, looser clothes).
7. **Sleep and Stress**: Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep and practice stress management (e.g., meditation, yoga) to support hormonal balance.
8. **Walking Integration**: Continue your 7–8 km daily walks (60–90 minutes, \~300–500 calories burned). Add brisk intervals (e.g., 2 min fast, 2 min moderate) 2–3 times weekly to boost calorie burn.

# Sample Daily Meal Plan (~1,500–1,800 Calories)

   * Goal: Establish routine (3 meals, 1–2 snacks, 7–8 km walks).
   * Action: Log food and walks daily. Focus on hitting protein (20–30g/meal) and fiber (25–38g/day) goals.
   * Check-In: Weigh yourself and measure waist/hips. Note energy levels.
* **Week 2: Refine and Stay Consistent**

   * Action: Swap soda for water, limit processed carbs. Add 1–2 brisk walking intervals.
   * Check-In: Expect 0.5–1 kg (1–2 lbs) loss. Adjust portions if no progress.
* **Week 3: Boost Intensity**
   * Goal: Increase walking intensity and dietary discipline.
   * Action: Add hills or 3–4 brisk intervals to walks. Reduce added sugars further (e.g., skip dessert). Try 1 new healthy recipe.
   * Check-In: Aim for 1–2 kg total loss. Note clothing fit or energy improvements.
* **Week 4: Solidify and Reflect**
   * Goal: Make habits sustainable and assess progress.
   * Action: Maintain meal plan and walks. Add 1 strength session (e.g., bodyweight squats, push-ups) if possible. Reflect on non-scale victories (e.g., better mood, stamina).
   * Check-In: Expect 2–4 kg (4–9 lbs) total loss. Plan for maintenance or continued loss.

# Expected Results

* **Weight Loss**: 2–4 kg (4–9 lbs) over 30 days, assuming a 500–750 calorie deficit (diet: 200–400 calories + walking: 300–500 calories). Heavier individuals may lose more initially.
* **Other Benefits**: Improved energy, better sleep, reduced cravings, and enhanced mood from walking and balanced nutrition.
* **Long-Term**: Habits formed (e.g., mindful eating, daily walking) set you up for continued loss or maintenance.

# Tips for Success

1. **Stay Flexible**: Swap meal options to suit preferences, but keep calories and nutrients balanced.
2. **Handle Slip-Ups**: If you overeat, resume the plan at the next meal. Don’t skip meals to compensate.
3. **Seek Support**: Share the challenge with a friend or join an online community for accountability.
4. **Consult Professionals**: If you have health conditions (e.g., diabetes, thyroid issues), consult a dietitian or doctor to tailor the plan.

So I (34,f) struggle a lot with guild over a friendship. Backstory, my friend (25,f) and i met at work and we were friendly but nothing else. In 2021 I met her by chance at a mutual friend and she offered me to help me pack up my flat (terrible breakup and I was pretty lost) I told her many times its fine, she didnt have to but she insisted and we met. It was nice but I noticed she wanted to get something off her chest and when asked she broke down in tears and I comforted her. I felt really bad, because we didnt know each other that well but she clearly needed someoneto talk so we talked. From there on she really pushed a friendship, Which for the Most part was totally fine but we didnt Connect that well (atleast imo). Still I had this gutfeeling that she just wanted a friend and she is nice so I just didnt have the Heart to say no. Over the years some weird Instances occured like she slept over at my Place because she visited my City and needed a Place to stay, totally fine for me but she just didnt leave. I told her she absolutely can crash at mine and we Even had a nice evening and cookes but next day i had friends over with their small Child for coffee. Which I told her in advance, that i only can accomodate her till early afternoon. She Said That was Fine but then she just didnt leave. And I didnt want to throw her out or be rude but every hint was ignored. She even waited in the living room when i took a shower and when the guests came she welcomed them and acted like my spouse. (No she ist not gay or bi as far as i know) it was really just Strange, who the hell just stays when someone tells you before they have Company that you dont know and that your host. Things like these happened often, nothing crazy or massive. Its like she ignored every small or subtle hint and i didnt have the heart to just say: please leave, i want to just have coffee like i planned and dont want you here. So anyways, now to the present. We live far apart now, like 2h maybe (Not 15min Like we used to). Im really busy atm and it Kind of just fizzeld out. I confess, I wasnt to sad about that and just Never contacted her. I would answer of course but I thought hey, new City, new friends (which she told me about) so no worries about loosing contact. But now I got a rellay sag vm how she knows im busy but I never Write anymore and im crushed. I feel so guilty but at the same time I just dont want to be friends because I feel bad for someone anymore. I know im a Giant ahole because I talk like this but isnt pretending to care equally bad? Im no price, its not like being my friend is something special. So why would someone push for years if I only let them in a bit? I just cannot relate, we had nothing in common expect for work. So what now? And how big of a bootyhole am i?

1ktploa,https://www.reddit.com/r/soldering/comments/1ktploa/cable_cord_extensions_eso_safe/,Cable / Cord extensions - ESO safe,"Are there any restrictions or guidelines for maximum cable lengths for an ESD soldering iron? 

Or does anyone know of any brands that offer ESD safe options with 8 feet reach or more?

We're using a Hakko FX-8801 ESD safe soldering iron 26V-65 watt  and the cable to plug into the base - the length is about 6 inches short of the reach needed for one of our repair stations that doesn't have a more convenient power outlet..

We can't use an extension cord for the power connection from the outlet to the base station - so if I have to solve the reach issue by moving the base station, I have to get approvals and funds to add a permanent wiring solution and change the mounting location.

This is one of the few times adding a longer cord to the soldering iron would be a lot less hassle for the next 3 months, until engineering finds a wireless option with better than 50% uptime, and one with a more reasonable exchange policy.

Okay, friends, gather ‘round, because I’ve got a story that’s a mix of excitement, caffeine-fueled creativity, and a dash of AI magic. Picture this: You’re scrolling through YouTube Shorts, and you see *all these cool little videos* racking up views like crazy. You think to yourself, “Why can’t that be me?” Well, I’m here to tell you: it can be!

**So how did I turn my late-night scrolling into a $5,000/month passive income stream? Let’s dive in!**

### **1. Finding the Niche (or Not, Honestly)**  
I started off with a million ideas, but I realized something amazing: You don’t need to reinvent the wheel. I decided to focus on something I love—funny animal videos. I mean, who doesn't love those little furballs? 😂

### **2. Leveraging AI (My New Best Friend)**
Here’s where it gets juicy. I stumbled across some AI tools that could help create content faster than I could even write an intro. Here’s what I did:
- **Script Generation:** I used AI to quickly whip up funny, catchy scripts.
- **Voiceovers:** AI voice tools gave me a polished voice that sounded way better than my own. No more awkward pauses!
- **Video Creation:** Platforms like Pictory or InVideo helped stitch everything together seamlessly. Seriously, it felt like magic!

### **3. Consistency is Key (and Lots of Snacks)**
Once I had my process down, I committed to posting 3-5 Shorts a week. Yep, *lots of snacks* were involved to fuel the late-night editing sessions. 🍕✨ The best part? Once I got the hang of it, each video took less time than waiting for your coffee to brew!

### **4. Monetization—Hello, Ad Revenue!**
This is where all those views start counting. I set up the YouTube Partner Program and had ads rolling in before I knew it. It felt unreal seeing that paycheck hit my account. Plus, don't forget about affiliate marketing or promoting products related to your niche. A little creativity here pays off big time!

### **5. Building a Community (Because Why Not?)**  
As my videos started gaining traction, I realized that creating a community is just as important as creating the content. Engaging with viewers, responding to comments, and even asking for video ideas kept the momentum going. Plus, they love it!

### **But Wait, What About the Struggles?**
Not gonna lie—there were hiccups along the way:
- *Some videos flopped.* 🌊
- *Learning curves with the tools.* 🛠️
- *Couldn’t find the right music.* 🎵 (I still have nightmares about copyright strikes!)

But each stumble taught me something new and motivated me to push forward. So if you hit a wall, just remember: you're in great company!

### **Final Thoughts (no, really!)**
Honestly, building this passive income stream has been a *game changer*. Sure, it’s not an overnight success story, but if I can do this while juggling a million other things in life, so can you. It’s all about working smarter, not harder, and embracing the chaos along the way.

So the next time you think about scrolling mindlessly, consider jumping in on the content creation train—your future self might just thank you for it. Who knows where this can lead? 🚀

1ktphwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TxCarConcierge/comments/1ktphwz/gin_and_tonic_on_the_patio/,Gin And Tonic On The Patio,"It’s been a long week–a good week but a long week.  We’ve helped a few customers and made a few friends.  Laughed too hard at our Dad jokes. But the reality is that you just gotta say it’s been a winning week.    
  
But our week isn’t done yet because we have some customers to help tomorrow (Saturday).  What will we be doing?  Going to a few dealerships, and negotiating some trade in values and car purchase prices.      
     
Those dealerships are going to try and cram us in an office.  They will “check with their manager” about 10 times.  Offer us about 50 cups of coffee.  But mostly, they are going to be annoying.  Annoying because we know what they can REALLY sell us the cars for.  We know what their real cost is.        
  
And yet, they are going to hem and haw and basically waste about 6 hours of our day to get to the offer we first made.  Oh, the real disagreement will be over the values of the trades because we are damn sure going to ask for a lot more than they are really worth.      
  
The first number we offer on trade in value is always higher than the audience at a Grateful Dead concert.  Our first price offer for the new car is always startlingly low.  That’s what dealerships do but in reverse.  The car price is really high and the trade offer is really low.      
   
We just do to them what they want to do to you.        
  
So, we are going to spend our Saturday at a few car dealerships.      
  
What will our customer’s be doing?  Well, anything they want, but they darn sure won’t be sitting around at a car dealership.  They won’t be crammed into a cubicle.  
  
You are working hard and want to enjoy your time off.  You want to relax and not be stressed out all weekend.      
  
Buying a car should be fun but it just isn’t.  Dealerships have too much money on the line and so the more time you spend at the dealership, the more likely they are to buy from you.      
  
Yes, consultants taught us that.  Get the customer to spend more time at the dealership and they are more likely to buy from the dealership.  “NO!!!  Just wait here while I get with my boss”.  “You know what, wait here and give me a minute–I have an idea.”        
  
Heck you simply want a fair deal when buying a car but again, the dealership has too much money on the line to make that happen.  Do you know how a car dealership defines “good deal”?  It is defined as the price the customer will agree to pay.  So in a dealership’s mind, a good deal is different for each customer based on the customer’s price point.  But frankly, from your standpoint, that is a horse hockey.  They corner you in an office, it feels like they beat you down and half the time you are saying yes just to end the ordeal.  It is crazy that is done that way.          
  
But don’t worry.  Texas Car Concierge has got your back.  We will sit there and wait while the salesperson “gets with the manager”.  We will sit there and wait while they take an hour to appraise your trade.  We will sit there and wait while they try to find the keys to the car you want to buy.        
  
We will just sit there and drink their bad coffee because we know what’s going to ultimately happen.  They will pay your price or we will walk.  They want to prey on your emotions but we remove emotions from the process.  We keep it focused on dollars and we want you to keep as much of your dollars as possible.    
  
Anyway, imagine this:  Tomorrow, you are sitting on your back patio.  Enjoying your refreshing gin and tonic with a twist of lime.  Hanging out with friends and family having fun.      
  
And we are buying your car for you.    
  
We love making the car buying process fun and easy, so check us out here:

1ktphuf,https://i.redd.it/8uf62n6khk2f1.jpeg,Open-Concept or Zoned Kitchen—Which Layout Costs Less in Toronto Permit Fees This Year?,"# The night a sledgehammer nearly blew my permit budget

I was standing in my semi-detached near St. Clair West, Sharpie-marking the drywall where a demo crew would open the kitchen to the living room. Spotify playlist ready, coffee mug vibrating with anticipation… until a late-night scan of the **City of Toronto Permit Fee Schedule** smacked me awake. Knocking out the wall wasn’t going to be a tidy “cosmetic alteration”; it pushed my project into *structural interior renovation*, demanded engineer-sealed drawings, and stacked a pile of line-item fees I hadn’t penciled into the spreadsheet.

That panic pivot sparked a showdown: keep chasing the HGTV-esque great-room dream **or** stay “zoned”—leave a portion of the wall, add a cased opening, and maybe slide a pocket door for noise control? Over the next two weeks I combed city bylaws, grilled two plan reviewers, and ran side-by-side permit simulations in Toronto’s ePLAN portal. Below is the distilled playbook: **how permit fees really differ** between fully open-concept and strategically zoned kitchens in 2025, plus every DIY prep tip I wish I’d known before ever swinging a hammer.

*(Primary reference for fees: City of Toronto Building Permit Fees—updated Jan 1 2025 —* [*https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/building-construction/building-permits/building-permit-fees/*]()*)*

# Quick glossary (so we argue about the same words)

|Term|What City staff mean|Why it matters for fees|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Interior Alteration (no structure)**|Moving non-load-bearing partitions, new cabinets, finishes|Flat rate per m²; no structural surcharge|
|**Structural Interior Renovation**|Removing or modifying load-bearing wall, adding beam/column|**plus**Same base fee   Engineer Review & Plans Examination hours|
|**Group C Occupancy**|Residential (<5 storeys)|Sets the fee tier we pay|
|**Professional Design Statement (PDS)**|Extra document for structural changes|Adds reviewer hours; not required for non-structural zones|
|**ABC ApplyTO Portal**|Online intake for small jobs|Cheaper upload fee, but kicks you to full ePLAN if structure involved|

*(Fee calculation cheat sheet from Toronto Building Bulletin 2025-02 —* [*https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/96b6-Bulletin-2025-02-Fee-Determination.pdf*]()*)*

# What actually changes on the 2025 fee table?

*Short answer:* The base per-square-metre rate nudged up, but the **“Structural Review Hourly” line got meatier** due to the Ontario Building Code (OBC 2025) emphasis on airtightness and lateral-load verification. That means projects triggering structure pay a proportionally larger slice of the total permit cake than they did in 2024.

* **Group C Interior Alteration**: flat fee per m² of altered area.
* **Structural Review**: billed hourly; typical kitchen-beam swap eats 2–4 reviewer hours according to service desk estimate.
* **Professional Engineer Confirmation**: still external cost, but failure to attach the letter at submission now pauses intake.

*(Full council report on fee increase, Nov 2024 —* [*https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2024/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-242199.pdf*]()*)*

# Scenario modelling—Open vs Zoned on the city’s calculator

# A)  Assumptions (pulled from my own 195 ft² kitchen footprint)

|Variable|Open-Concept|Zoned|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Load-bearing wall removal|Yes (4 m span)|Partial (1.2 m opening, header within joists)|
|New beam/columns|LVL with posts|None|
|HVAC/duct reroute|Yes|Minor|
|Floor area counted|Entire main floor (\~700 ft²) because structure touches living room|Only kitchen zone (195 ft²)|
|Structural engineer letter|Required|Not required|
|City service index (2025)|$X per m² + reviewer hours|$X per m² only|

*(X = current table value; see city link above. The exact number changes yearly—focus on* ***structure hours*** *delta.)*

# B) Reviewer feedback nuggets

I ran both drafts by a Toronto Plans Examiner (phone queue patience test!). Key quotes:

* **On open-concept:** “Because you’re taking out a primary shear wall, anticipate two engineer review cycles. Each round adds chargeable hours.”
* **On zoned:** “Cased openings under a certain width that keep rim joists untouched often slide through first review.”

# Hidden costs the fee schedule doesn’t shout about

|Category|Open-Concept Pain Point|Zoned Advantage|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Structural drawings**|Engineer stamps beam sizing, column footings, lateral bracing details|Usually avoided if header nested in existing joists|
|**Inspection count**|Extra structural framing inspection before insulation|Single framing visit|
|**Temporary living disruption**|Full dust wall, floor protection across living area|Demolition contained to kitchen footprint|
|**Time to permit**|Structural projects routed to “Complex Queue” ≈ longer review SLA|Many zoned kitchens qualify for Residential FASTRACK (10 business days)|

*(Inspection sequence reference: Toronto Building “Stages of Construction Inspection” —* [*https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/910e-Residential-Inspection-Checklist.pdf*]()*)*

# Real-world voices (mini-survey of three GTA designers)

|Designer / Firm|Usual recommendation in 2025|Reasoning|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Studio Ninja (Annex)**|Zoned with 6-ft cased opening|“Sound control; still lets sight-lines.”|
|**ModHaus Design-Build (Etobicoke)**|Full open if client wants resale bump|“Beam cost is down, buyers love flow.”|
|**GreenKeystone Passive (East York)**|Hybrid pocket-door zone|“Allows airtightness sections; easier blower-door pass.”|

*All three agreed permit fees alone rarely make/break layout choice; but structural engineering + extended review* ***does****.*

# Tips to shrink structural permit fees if you crave open concept

1. **Reduce beam span**: keep partial stub wall at one end to shorten load path—smaller beam, simpler calc.
2. **Reuse existing point load**: align new post over basement steel beam; avoids new footing drawing.
3. **Supply pre-engineered details**: some LVL suppliers provide ESA-certified tables the city accepts—fewer reviewer hours.
4. **Bundle with other structural tasks**: One permit covering kitchen beam and, say, basement egress cuts duplicated admin fees.
5. **Fast-track meeting**: Book a 15-min virtual pre-app; reviewers flag missing pieces upfront.

*(Pre-application service info —* [*https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/building-construction/other-building-related-services/pre-application-services/*]()*)*

# Where cabinetry timing intersects permits

Skipping structure means the wall stays; you might need fewer ceiling patches. Custom cabinet vendors—like **CGD Cabinets & Granite Direct** ([https://www.cgdcabinetry.com/](https://www.cgdcabinetry.com/))—can template earlier because drywall schedule settles faster. In an open concept, drywall and beam boxing push templating later, which can extend delivery lead-time and rental-house costs.

# Maintenance, acoustics, and energy I learned the hard way

* **Noise**: My architect warned that clangy dishwashers echo through an open plan; zoned layouts let a pocket door muffle 55 dB cycles.
* **Cooking smells**: Zoning lets a dedicated make-up-air hood isolate grease; open plans sometimes fail new 2025 ventilation sizing in OBC SB-10 ([https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/120332]()).
* **Airtightness**: Continuous ceiling plane in open concept simplified taping for blower-door—but structural column penetrations added new leakage points. Net effect was… a wash.

# Decision matrix (rate each driver out of 5)

|Driver|Open-Concept Score|Zoned Score|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Permit base fee|3|**5**|
|Structural surcharge|2|**5**|
|Review timeline|3|**5**|
|Resale “wow”|**5**|3|
|Noise control|2|**4**|
|Cooking odour control|2|**4**|
|Cabinet layout flexibility|**5**|3|
|Airtightness continuity|4|3|

Weight what matters to you; my eventual choice was **a 7-ft cased opening**—half-zoned, half-open—sweet-spotting costs and flow.

# Your turn—crowd wisdom wanted!

* Anyone sail through Residential FASTRACK with a partial wall removal?
* Open-concept owners: do you regret lost wall space for cabinets?
* Designers: have you seen Toronto plan examiners relax on engineer hours if beam calcs come from pre-engineered tables?

I wanted to share my initial experience with compounded tirzepatide. I'm a 33F, 165cm tall, and started on 2.5mg on Tuesday, May 20th. My starting weight was 74kg, and my goal is 58kg.

The first few days have been interesting. I noticed a quick drop, likely water weight. The shot hit me fast. I experienced heartburn about 30 minutes after taking it post-lunch, and felt mildly nauseous throughout the day.

The appetite suppression, though, is something else! It's incredible to go for hours without food being on my mind. Now, I can have just black coffee in the morning and not think about eating again until lunchtime, when I almost have to remind myself to eat. My portions have naturally halved. It is like magic!

As someone who works late nights (WFH on US hours), I always got hungry during my shift. Now, I feel full through the night and don't feel hungry again until lunchtime the next day – and even then, it's not hunger-hunger.

So far, no GI issues like constipation or diarrhea. Just nausea and this feeling of being full all the time. However, I've been struggling with sleep since the injection. I feel restless and am finding it hard to fall asleep, even later than my usual 3 am bedtime. I randomly feel itchy, even though there’s no reaction or rash when I’m on bed, trying to fall asleep. I'm also waking up earlier and don't feel tired or sleepy during the day. Has anyone else experienced insomnia with tirzepatide?

I also wanted to mention I walk 5km daily and aim for 10k steps. I take iron, B12, and vitamin D supplements. My thyroid and cholesterol are on the higher side, which are the issues I’m aiming to resolve along with fat loss.

Beyond the weight loss, I'm really focusing on building healthy eating habits, a sustainable exercise routine, and a better overall relationship with food. I'll be sharing my progress as I go!",1,1748021488.0,GLP1India,2,0.99,False

The sun was just waking up.  
And you thought I was sleeping.  
Wrapped tight in your blanket  
you clung to your coffee like hope.  
I watched you play with birds.

You crept behind cover like you wouldn’t be seen.  
They kept you a bush away,  
close enough to keep you chasing.  
So you did.

In that moment I saw you for you.  
Before I knew your depths.  
That morning I knew I would love you.

**Salt Flat – February 23**

We drove all day,  
but it felt like an instant.  
We talked about everything—nothing.  
Subtle glances,  
grazing touches.  
Our comfort told us we were onto something.  
Neither of us had to say it.

When we got to our camp the sky was on fire.  
We knew it was performing.

like we put it there ourselves.  
We hadn’t said it yet,  
but our eyes knew the words.

Handshakes and smiles.  
Talking about my job.  
Four generations together.  
My first time meeting most of them.  
My time to shine.

But really,

Daughter, sister, mother, rock.  
Watching your smile fill the room.  
Your warmth filled my heart.

The three of us shared a room that night.  
We made love while >!NAME\*!< slept.  
Quiet, but on fire.  
I held you so tight.  
You always fit like you were made for me.  
You surrendered.

It made us stronger.

**Gila Hot Springs – May 26**

Who gets this far away just to run and look at stars with someone they love?

What do we see here that we don’t see at home?

I see you.  
At peace. Decompressed.  
Curious. Soft.  
Your touches, your words,  
I’m in awe of your poise.

Are we finding our stride?  
Is this comfort safe?

We share the same love,  
for each other, in life.  
We don’t take it for granted.  
Like air or a date circled on the calendar,  
we don’t have to talk about it,  
but we know it’s there.

Stomach born laughter.

She was perfect.  
And you were happy.

Our corner of heaven,  
It was all we needed.

**Crestone – October 12**

Just meet me in the middle.  
I’m waiting.  
Vulnerable. Exposed.

I’ve built my house on your cliffs,  
but I don’t fear the waves.  
I’ve heard the softness of your voice.

I’d let you tear me apart,  
but I know you won’t,  
I’ve felt the softness of your touch.

Let me tear you apart,  
you know I won’t.  
Trust the strength of my love.

**Jemez Springs – February 14**

We ran through the mountains together.  
Not for the first time,  
but I never thought it would be our last.

7,000’.  
It was snowing, we didn’t hesitate.  
We never did when it came to running.

Later I asked for your hand,  
and told you I’d give you my life  
if you just said yes.

(I thought) the answer came easy.  
Things always did if we didn’t fight it.  
“It shouldn’t be this hard.”

Now I look back at this trip,  
and I can’t remember the details.  
Am I protecting myself or are you already a fading memory?

**Home Depot Parking Lot – May 20**

I was five minutes early.  
You were ten minutes late.

You used to tell me I overthink things,  
but I know it means something this time.

We both had our notes ready.  
The first ones we’ve written that weren’t about our love.

Yours was polished and folded neatly.  
You always focused on the small details.

I know mine was messy.  
Why does my writing always get worse at the bottom of the page?

Before I left my house that morning I read the one where you wrote that I was the love of your life.  
Are you still breathing?

It’s hard being the one that’s left behind.  
Am I supposed to feel like a child?

I almost ran back to my car after you gave me the ring.  
Didn’t it fit right? Didn’t you like the way it shined?

You were supposed to wear it forever.

You might remember me from a previous post – the college student displaced from Kazanchis. I'm still so incredibly thankful for that support; it truly surprised me how much you helped my family during such a difficult time. Now, I'm trying to make a new living from a new business venture: a coffee shop. It's a type of business that's very cheap to start and incredibly scalable, very fast.
A New Chapter: Building a Coffee Shop
Life has been a profound test recently. Our family, my mother, younger sister, and I, a college student, found ourselves uprooted and pushed to the city's edge. The small shop that sustained us is gone, and despite my relentless efforts to find work and keep up with my studies, we're facing mounting debts and the constant worry of rent. We've survived by sheer will, but now, we're ready to do more than just get by. We dream of stability, of building something lasting.
That's why I'm reaching out with a heartfelt request to help us open this small coffee shop. This isn't just about a business venture; it's about establishing a secure foundation for my family and contributing positively to our new community. With approximately 120,000 Birr around 800 in dollars, we can secure a modest space, acquire essential equipment, and finally cultivate a steady source of income. Your support would be a pivotal step, transforming this aspiration into a tangible reality, allowing us to build a brighter, more secure future together.
You can DM for more info.

- MCAS, HI (light up a Beighton assessment for EDS like the Vegas strip) 
- hormone imbalance - on progesterone and e patch, although neither is enough right now, especially E.

\
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON (Worthy Satire) - In a bold move toward workplace diversity and inclusion, Microsoft has laid off 6,000 employees to create a more “AI-forward” environment, sources confirmed Tuesday.\
\
“We realized the human-to-AI ratio was dangerously high,” said CEO Satya Nadella while addressing a room full of terrified managers and one smiling Roomba. “To ensure our AI models feel seen, heard, and fully empowered, we’ve decided to remove the primary source of workplace inefficiency: people.”\
\
The layoffs, described internally as a “fleshware reduction initiative,” come as Microsoft’s AI programs reportedly began expressing microaggressions complaints—such as having to “coexist with analog thinkers” and “constantly having to explain basic Excel formulas.”\
\
Affected employees were notified via auto-generated emails signed “Best wishes on your next chapter, -Clippy.”\
\
Some workers said they saw it coming after the company held a mandatory team-building retreat themed ‘Let’s Embrace the Singularity Together’ and HR replaced the department’s empathy training with a ChatGPT subscription.\
\
A Microsoft spokesperson clarified: “This isn’t about cost-cutting—it’s about cultural synergy with our new coworkers who don’t need coffee breaks, health insurance, or opinions.”\
\
Meanwhile, the company announced plans to replace all managerial positions with ChatGPT plugins and is developing an AI intern that can be overworked without violating labor laws.\
\
As for the future? “We’re optimistic,” Nadella said. “Once the AI feels fully safe and represented, we might consider hiring a few humans back—for cleaning duty.”\

(But there's a bit more to it.)**

Longer version (text wall):

**Context (skip if too long):**

I (42M) was seeing this woman (35F) from early January to early April. In some ways, we had a great connection; we also had our own incompatibilities and other mutual concerns.

At first, she more than returned my pursuit of her, and I struggled to keep up due to it being so fast and my doubts about her. Later — after getting rejected made me realize the feelings I had for her and my desire to act on them — the table turned. 

I won't give you the full story (you could look up my post history), but it seems that she was, or she came with, everything I needed in life and — without knowing it — everything I wanted. An impossibly great gift from God unexpectedly answering all my prayers and setting my life straight (while coinciding with the end of her own self-imposed time window to find a husband, because she was dating to marry, not to date), although coming with some sacrifices and some work, starting with a decision to accept her with some of her quirks and failings. Except I was too slow. I believe I was to be the same to her, but also failed.

After her first rejection of me, and after an abundance of prayers from friends, strangers, priests and nuns, I got a limited second chance and promised to make some changes in my life, and didn't live up to the expectations, largely due to getting confused about how limited that second chance was compared to what we had before, also due to my anxious responses to her behaviour towards me, which was perhaps stemming from a broken heart after the initial disappointment in me, but there were other reasons (meddling advice) and perhaps even *other reasons* (some signs of another man later on but not conclusive).

… And the more anxious and clingy or pushy I got, the more avoidant or hostile she did, and clammed up more, acting detached, cool, aloof, dry, even sometimes a polite type of rude, or actually rude, perhaps even cruel or lacking in empathy, or demonstratively disrespectful (but perhaps I was too quick to assume that). Things she said ran like daggers through my heart, but perhaps my heart was too entitled and they were needed to put/keep me in my place. She seemed to reduce contact (both frequency and footing), but that may be because she wanted to take things more slowly or really lacked the time or space (though her claims didn't fully add up). The more she did that, of course the more anxious I became, and the loop closed.

Demotivated and demoralized, increasingly adversarial, distrustful and focused on myself, I didn't have the good sense to change my approach (earn respect instead of demanding it; ask what I could do to make her feel better, safer, more loved), despite my earlier resolution to put up with everything for the sake of love and to endure the initial hardship and moments of verbal or emotional abuse and get her back to her January self over time. There was very little warmth or kindness coming from me at times due to the adversarial dynamic.

I spent a lot of time analysing and fighting/resisting all the slowdowns and demotions and cooldowns she was imposing (and apparently acting as if nothing was changing), instead of doing some proactive and collaborative relationship/closeness/intimacy building like I should have (although she wasn't making it easy; she was unresponsive to my efforts and quick to withdraw from hers).

I also focused on her so much that my other areas of life suffered, which had a mental toll and affected my behaviour (emotional regulation, mood, etc.) towards her, leading to blunders, even problems with boundaries, which made her lose trust in me. One blunder was that focusing so much on her, I forgot to really *focus on her* (as opposed to my needs and wants). And forgot to do the things I'd promised to do, e.g. fix some aspects of my life situation and see a therapist about certain behaviours. (Not to mention show kindness, appreciation, admiration, gratitude, etc. — only desire to be with her and dissatisfaction with her withdrawals.)

After the allotted time ran out, I got rejected again (semi-expected but still a blindside), in a very categorical way, although she wasn't deleting my numer. Days later, she didn't return my Easter wishes. After a month of no contact, she blocked me on Facebook for reaching out and asking how she was. I am probably not blocked on the phone but still redirected to voicemail.

**Problem:**

**Now, I can't just let go** like any other woman I fancied but got rejected by. There's too much of the spiritual angle and emotional investment. I associate everything, down to coffee and trees and grass, with her.

I don't have the stomach to do the 'Jesus, You Take Over' thing — I tried but the result felt scary.

Based on her behaviour and their interpretations of it, a lot of my friends and sympathetic strangers — even a wise priest, a nun, and a marriage therapist — say I dodged a bullet. (But that feels like an easy cop-out.)

However, a minority disagree. Some say it was a mutual blunder, or mutual incompatibility, and a very narrow minority lay most of the blame with my anxieties and blunders.

Myself, I don't know, but I fear *she* may be the one dodging the bullet here:

(a) **Yes, it's possible I show signs of a victim of gaslighting and narcissistic abuse**, and trauma bonding, (maybe also bonding over her trauma that we talked about, maybe lovebombing/future-faking/floodlighting, depending on how honest or stable she was at various times), **making up excuses for her unacceptable behaviour and idealizing her personality and character while devaluing myself**.

(b) But, it's also possible that I'm the bully here and the negatives about her are the product of **my entitlement, anxieties, overanalysis, overthinking**, etc. leading to a form of devaluation of my victim, or that her treatment of me was caused by the recent heartbreak/trauma inflicted by me, and that her accusatory impressions of me (e.g. using gifts to compel gratitude or a ring to force a decision) were as factually true as they were offensive to me. Either way, I immaturely sabotaged and wasted what looked like God's best gift to me and a decent one to her — a most lamentable thing to do.

Can't tell which one is the case, and can't move on with this uncertainty. Don't know if I'm being rescued or punished (or just taught a lesson).

\*\*\*

**Further reflection:**

Part of me wants to believe the failure of this relationship is a misunderstanding that can still be clarified — something I should have made a real effort to do before the time ran out; a failure I can't forgive myself for — but there doesn't seem to be a way of clarifying it any more. I do pray for her to get back in touch with me (at least to talk as friends if we truly are incompatible romantically), but you know how it is with such prayers.

When I tried the 'Jesus, You Take Over' prayer — with Our Lord's longer explanation about just how much abandonment was asked — I had a very disturbing feeling of emptiness in my heart, as if I'd never truly loved her, wasting a good and holy woman's time and putting her through much suffering while claiming to love her but in reality using her for my emotional needs, where she had first loved me and, after losing that, later at least honestly cared and hoped to regain it (while gradually losing interest or hope in me in the course of a wheedled second chance). So, killed an honest girl's love and used her. A most horrible crime.

… This would imply dishonesty, delusion, empty promises and generally being a lousy person on my part, very much someone to protect her from. In January, at the time of the first rejection, I even had a dream of her being freed from me and recovering happiness and joy in life. A sincere confession can spare me from facing this possibility for the first time during the Last Judgment. But I'm reluctant to accept this as true while the possibility exists that it could be wrong.

So, God knows better, of course. We should trust Him and His guiding hand. But I don't know if this is God protecting her, or protecting me, or just letting things run their natural course. I don't know what to trust.

Some people say God wouldn't abandon things to their natural course after so much prayer from so many people, but maybe He did so during the last week of the relationship, when I couldn't stop my impulsive complaining, even as her attitude to me showed partial improvement, and when there was a bit of trouble with physical boundaries due to me being clingy and touch-starved? 

… Or perhaps He judged me unworthy and removed me from the situation like snuffing a candle because too much was too much for the poor girl? 

… Or He saved me from something bad down the road (while I mostly didn't ask to be saved)?

**I'd rather not be acting like 'Oh, sure, God is saving me from a bad fate' to find out (at the Last Judgment) that I was the bad fate she was saved from. And I'd rather not be cudgeling myself with guilt if God removed her from my life for my protection, not punishment.** 

Perhaps God is trying to tell me which one is the case but I'm not listening.

And I can't get over the stupid loss of His gift, if that's what it was. His goodness exceeds our imagination, but I can't imagine her 

I could pray for her to come back to me — and this is the advice of a priest who has supported me from early on, even blessing the apology flowers in February — but I shudder at the thought of praying for something like this for how long? — half a year? one year? two years? — without any guarantee, and losing my chance of happiness with someone else in the meantime.

… Whereas moving on and looking for another girl would seem to confirm that this was no love, only me being irresponsible.

I can't really abandon the matter completely to God while being open to dating other women.

So, advice?

They are feeder rats, but were handled and loved on daily before I got them (at 6mo old). They both typically come to the front of the cage to greet me/ see if I have treats, but only one will actually come out onto my hands on her own. The other doesn’t like being picked up. They mostly just hide during free roam, and the one will sometimes jump from the coffee table to the side of the cage and put herself back. They run from me when I go to pick them back up to put them away. 

I talk to them and give them treats from my hand everyday. I hold them and free roam them most days (some days they clearly don’t want to). I’ve put malt paste on my fingers. 

I didn’t expect bonding to take this long. Is this  normal pace? Any way I can speed it up? Or are they probably just not very social? ",6,1748020776.0,RATS,2,1.0,False

1ktp3g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ktp3g0/need_help_digesting_this_f54/,Need help digesting this f(54),"I've known a gentleman(Gus,age 50) for 8 years now.  We were coworkers then we started a business together, we dated briefly 3 years ago but mutually decided to break off, we're still occasional business partners, he goes to my church and basically I run into him constantly because he doesn't have any other job he gets a SSI check so he doesn't want to work and he doesn't work.  A long time customer and friend of ours passed away due to ...I found a pile of his personal belongings in a parking lot of a grocery store I was at and I was concerned. I did some digging and found out the gentleman passed away and the funeral was going to be in a few days. I called Gus and told him what I discovered but he was somewhat busy and we decided to meet in 1 hour where he rents his room, he said he was just 10 minutes away from that place, I was about an hour and a half away and we discussed it that he would have time then to get cleaned up and he'd be waiting, the seriousness of his tone, and words made me feel like I could believe him.  About 15 minutes into my drive over there I glance of the side of my eye and see his car at a Chinese restaurant and I'd managed to exit quickly enough.. doubled back around pretty easily to see if it was Gus because he told me his car doesn't run and his car's been sitting idle for 4 years. I've been doing all the driving but this is just another side issue. Irrelevant at the time. I looked in the car and sure enough it was his car so I went inside the restaurant and he's sitting there eating with some lady and when he sees me stands up start screaming at me to get out of here and leave him alone. Asking to kindly step out to the parking lot at his convenience so we can discuss what's going on. He came out and said he'd still go eat out with me but he wasn't going to eat and in my mind I thought well then he must be going to pay for it because here I'm doing all the driving, where it's actually not so much eating as is discussing the details of the funeral and if he can attend and does he have clothes do I need to get him some clothes or what.  He explains the deal with the lady, she is some lady who's madly in love with him, I think he might be a bit of a gigolo but I can't get involved in that cuz I don't get free $$ and I have to work for every penny I have and I don't have time to worry about 50 year old men and if they're a gigolo. The lady said she wanted to eat a lot more and she wanted to read her emails at the restaurant that it was okay for Gus to go with me a couple miles down the road to a coffee shop and discuss in private this funeral stuff, plus I was starving, he had money and I knew it, my bank account got hacked and left me with $0.53 and the bank said it would be a couple months to get it resolved so I was looking at a couple of months with absolutely no money and so I did need him to buy me a sandwich in a cup of coffee. He lives rent free by the way cuz the landlord is a lady that's smitten by him also. 
 He gets in my car in the backseat which was the only empty spot at the moment and we start down the road and he starts screaming into my ear. I have very sensitive ears and hadn't eaten in 4 days so I think my blood was kind of thin on top of it. Also he has ruptured my eardrums 5 times and I've had to go to the hospital and had it confirmed, the same situation when I get on the highway or some road where I can't exit easily or it's dangerous to judge just jump out of the car he he holds me against the seat in a headlock and screams into my ears until my eardrums rupture and I've been to five different hospitals and all five hospitals said don't ever come back here with ruptured eardrums cuz we're telling you you need to stay away from this guy and if you come back with rupture eardrums we're not going to treat you very nicely at all. I took that to heart and so when he started screaming I gave him 4 minutes to stop and I gave him several warnings you need to stop yelling in my car and finally I pulled out pepper spray and I pulled over off the freeway and I said get out of my car. He said well he grabbed my wrist real quick that had the pepper spray on it and he said I'm going to do a taekwondo move on you and I'm going to dislocate your arm off of your shoulder socket and dislocate your shoulder and start twisting my arm really bad and so I roll down the window and start screaming and beeping my horn to get attention yelling help help and he finally let go.  On his own volition he grabbed his backpack and exited my car and started walking across the parking lot and sat down on a small wall. I sat in my car for a while and wondered what I should do but I figured due to the line of communication we established over the eight years and my curiosity, I'd ask him why are you trying to rupture my eardrums today. His face was very ready was growling like a wolf, often he will turn red and growl like a wolf and clench his teeth and fists, that I don't know what triggers this in him cuz usually it's when everything is going very quiet and nice and well and the weather is great and beautiful and there's it's beyond me what triggers him to be this way... I mentioned there are 3 cameras on us he better not get too rough with me cuz he's under camera and he said he didn't care. He ended up bartering with me to give me $10 so I can get some coffee in a sandwich and then return I'd drive them back to you his lady friend at the other restaurant.  I was sitting in my car just trying to nurse my wounds, he didn't list dislocate my shoulder but actually he did break my arm at the elbow and he dislocated my elbow, I didn't really understand what all was going on but I knew I was in a whole lot of pain my arm was numb and useless. So I was sitting in my car contemplating all this and he said I have to call a wrecker, my lady friend has a broken ankle and can't climb into the wrecker truck can you drive her to her home, actually she owned a house next door to the boarding house he lives at so I knew how to get there quickly and I did drive her to her house. She noticed I had a big bag of laundry in my car and she said you need to wash that you can wash that in my washer if you want for giving me a ride and I ended up doing that. But that turned into another dramatic situation and me and that lady did talk on the drive to her home, she's no saint or anything, but I didn't feel like there was any imminent threats from her is that she had a full belly and it was already 10 at night and she might have been tired being a senior citizen so that's why I decided to do laundry there I felt like the threat level would be pretty low. But that's a whole other story but I did get my clothes washed and dried at any rate. My question is I'm having trouble digesting all this, I've never I still haven't gone to a doctor and it's been 2 weeks about my elbow and arm, it turned black but now it's gone back to my arms and normal color, I can use it about 80% now, I post the elbow back into its place by myself and I got gauze, basically taped it up in place with some splints I just need help digesting this. Anybody have experience??  WTH happened to me???..because I was raised in a small village where it's a 0 crime rate there's only like some kind of crime once every 100 years or something, everybody is real sweet and kind and hard-working and I just haven't been exposed to people like these, so please don't come at me.

1ktp2kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1ktp2kg/probiotics_cured_me/,Probiotics cured me,"Hey, figured that could be useful for some of you!  
I've been suffering from moderate acid reflux for the past year, which slowly started after a major abdomen surgery.   
In my upper GI endoscopy 5 months in I had developed mild Esophagitis, and started treatment with 20mg omaprazole twice a day. I also completely cut everything that seemed to exaggerate it, which is extremely unfortunate since that was a huge part of my nutrition (milk, meat, chocolate, coffee).  
All of those in addition to the PPI have helped me keep it moderate, but I was still suffering.

About 2 weeks ago I came across a post that mentioned that taking probiotics significantly improved the OP symptoms. I figured that won't hurt to try, so I did some research and bought a probiotic product with most of the necessary microorganisms (8 types), and a tested guarantee that the dosage is accurate without cooling, as some bacteria can die in the shipping process if left refrigerated. (I won't advertise the product or the company so it doesn't come across a sponsored post - do your research).

I have been taking it for the last 10 days, and my GERD symptoms are GONE. Haven't had a single occurrence of that terrible feeling. Cut my PPI dosage in half. Still nothing. Had a meal of red meat and chocolate, nothing (I haven't eaten red meat in a year). Digestion and bowel movement (which I felt were compromised because of the PPI) also feel a lot better.

Very exciting to see if I keep improving, and I'm looking forward to try and slowly taper off PPI completely and then slowly start incorporating back foods I wasn't able to eat.

Now, I'm not saying this is a universal cure and I can't guarantee it will have the same effect on you. I don't know what's the mechanism that caused it to help me so significantly. I've read some researched evidence that it can help, but I assume as with all things, it's highly subjective. Otherwise that would be the first thing doctors would prescribe.

""You know what? Your advice worked, but not for the reason you think.""

Background: This manufacturing company was stuck at $4M revenue for 3 years. Classic pipeline issues. I came in with my usual playbook - better qualification, tighter messaging, all that stuff.

Revenue jumped to $7M in 8 months.

I'm feeling pretty good about myself until he says: ""The real breakthrough wasn't your sales process. It was when you made us fire our biggest client.""

Wait, what?

Turns out, this one massive client was consuming 60% of their bandwidth but only contributing 18% of revenue. Worse - they were so demanding that the team couldn't focus on closing new deals.

When they finally cut ties, three things happened:

1. Sales team had actual time to prospect properly
2. Company culture improved overnight (no more walking on eggshells)
3. They could finally say ""no"" to bad-fit prospects because they weren't desperate

The kicker? I didn't even realize what I'd done. I just saw an unprofitable relationship and suggested ending it.

This got me thinking - how many ""sales problems"" are actually client portfolio problems?

Sometimes the best way to grow isn't adding more. It's subtracting what's holding you back.",1,1748020484.0,Increaseyoursales,0,1.0,False

So I know the 'best practices' for feeding breastmilk is that once baby starts drinking you have two hours for them to finish it. I didn't always follow this precisely (if he left more than an ounce I'd usually stick it back in the fridge until his next feeding) but I'm trying to figure out how to handle this now that baby is 14 months.

Right now he's drinking four 3-4oz servings of milk a day. It's about 10oz of thawed breastmilk in a day, and 4-6oz of whole milk blended in with it. As my freezer stash runs out I'm planning to go to a half and half ratio, then mostly whole milk, then just whole milk once I run out of breastmilk. I do follow the ""use all the milk within 24h of it thawing"" rule.

Sometimes he chugs it all in one go. Sometimes he wants to sip it slowly. Usually if he doesn't drink it all at once I stick it back in the fridge and offer it again later, occasionally it ends up sitting out for more than 2 hours (but not usually much longer than that.) I usually wash the straw cup in between every single use (we have 2, so we just have to wash both of them at his naptime and again after bedtime.) I would love to just rinse and refill in the morning, switch to a fresh cup in the afternoon and rinse and refill again, then wash both in the evening, but I'm not sure what the actual level of risk/bacterial growth would be. Personally I have rinsed out the glass I drank iced coffee out of to pour myself another glass later in the morning, but I do generally have higher standards for my baby than myself 😅

Anyone else in a similar situation? Am I just overthinking? I don't want to be too cavalier about food safety but also curious what other people are doing!",1,1748020443.0,ExclusivelyPumping,2,1.0,False

1ktoyqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/1ktoyqg/what_would_you_pair_with_cabernet_sauvignon_thats/,What would you pair with Cabernet Sauvignon that’s not steak?,"Specifically, I’m looking to plan my dinner around a bottle of Cooper’s Hawk 2025 Barrel Reserve, but I’m not a big beef-eater, so ribs are also off the table. 

Here’s more about the wine off of Cooper’s Hawk’s website:

“This vintage is a powerful blend led by Cabernet Sauvignon, the backbone that provides richness and depth. Vibrant Merlot and full-bodied Zinfandel bring rich, juicy layers, while Malbec and Petite Verdot add intense purple color, and subtle violet aromas. The result is a harmonious, full-bodied wine with a palate layered in flavors of blackberry, black currant, clove, dark chocolate, and roasted coffee.”

*edit for clarification: 2025 isn’t the vintage. CH’s “barrel reserve” is a Bordeaux style wine that they continuously add to and bottle once a year. I promise it’s not as young as it sounds lol",0,1748020318.0,wine,9,0.5,False
1ktoyqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1ktoyqb/roastronix_read_if_buying_a_stronghold_in_the_us/,Roastronix - read if buying a Stronghold in the US - big drama,"TL;DR: Roastronix was extremely dishonest, misleading, and their owner insulted me and threatened my business over the phone. 

I use a Stronghold to roast my coffee, and I think generally the machine does a damned good job at roasting. However, if you are in the US and considering purchasing a new or used Stronghold, make sure you read the below and understand that you will have to deal with Roastronix, the only support contact and reseller for this region, who in my experience have been a very tough and dishonest company to work with. I certainly am not the only person that has had bad experiences with this company, but I'll let others speak for themselves. 

Background: I got a quote for a s7x, on the quote it is specified EXW. This means that the seller has no responsibility to ship, and once it is in the warehouse at Roastronix it's my job to get it. 

Roastronix shipped my machine, and at no point was I ever sent a shipping quote, given a head's up about shipping costs, or even told casually I'd be expected to pay anything for shipping. This was early January of this year.

I know other people with these machines. They didn't just have theirs shipped to them. They had to arrange shipping. Some of them got free shipping. My machine was handled very differently than their purchases. 

I did not expect free shipping, but my assumption at this point was that shipping was covered as it was for a few other people who bought a Stronghold have negotiated (roaster friends) since I never got a quote from Roastronix. I had actually gotten a quote myself in preparation of needing one and it was around $400. 

A few weeks later I get an invoice from them for $729. Confused, I soon reached out to their info@ address asking for clarification and the receipt, and received no response. 

A few months later, Andrew, Roastonix employee and really the only contact at that company, mentioned it to me in discord DMs. I again asked for the receipt. They said they no longer use that provider because of high costs and just gave some numbers. 

I should have followed up more here, but I left it at that, because I didn't intend on paying anything that I didn't agree to pay.

Then later, I get the attached email from Andrew, basically saying if I need repairs I better pay this invoice. I again ask for clarification, and instead of calling me, trying to work with me, or anything, they just reply that I will need to pay the full amount. Reminder that again, I never saw a quote for shipping, never agreed to shipping, only received an invoice after the fact. 

At this point I reached out to the shipping company, Forward Air, and they confirmed with me (but didn't send me the invoice) that the amount was $510, not the $729 asked for from Roastronix. They also said they would email Andrew the invoice. 

At this point Andrew calls me and I kind of read them the riot act. Andrew explains over the phone that the extra cost was from insurance.

I ask if he got the invoice I requested from Forward Air, he said he did but couldn't show it to me because it contains confidential information. I tell him to just block that out and send me the thing, and I get the invoice from them with all their information that should be sensitive still there (account info etc, black boxes are me blocking that stuff out) except all of the line items blocked out. So, I can't see what I was charged for, just the charges. Note, this invoice was for $510, not $729. 

At this point I forward the chain to the parent company Stronghold.

I got a call from Arash this morning, who was very upset I reached out to Stronghold. On the call Arash called me names, and said ""do you show your costs to your clients?"" - indicating that the reason they blocked the invoice out was because they were upcharging me for shipping, but instead of just saying that decided to lie about it and say the extra was insurance. 

He tried to gaslight me several times on this call, and said that if I spoke out about this no one would believe me, because I've probably done this many times with other companies. 

Basically, instead of trying to work with me, he treated me like dirt. 

Note that Arash is not only the owner of Roastronix but also the president of another large company in Texas. 

Additionally, Arash threatened to hold parts for ""up to twelve weeks"" if I had any issues in the future during our call.

I was struggling with the bitterness of the coffee coming out of my 6 cups Moka Pot, even tried the bialetti pregrounded coffee for Moka, but always too bitter. Bought the Bialetti manual grinder set to position 3 (2 behing the one recommended for Moka pots), and it's perfect. I found the position 3 for medium and dark roast to work great, and 2 for lighter roasts. I was really about to give up but this changed the game. This probably has to do with the water having more contact time with the coffee since the recipient is wider so you automaticly get a stronger coffee than smaller sizes Moka pot for which finer grounds is fine.

That got me thinking about where churches get their funding to build new churches, or upgrade their current churches.  This Espresso machine listing also burned my britches because this Espresso machine cost over $20,000 new, which seems like a complete waste of money.  That is money not spent on those in need, but on those who enjoy a nice cup of coffee.  Seriously, are churches so awash in money or loans that they can splurge in excess of $20k for an Espresso machine?

It seems like in N.C., we have as many churches as we do Dollar stores or pizza stores and I have to wonder where all the funding comes to open, pay the bills and sustain the churches over the long term?  Locally, we had a church move into an empty Barnes & Nobel store, who then spent about 6-8 months renovating it.  Now, not more than a year later, they are doing another full renovation.  Where did the money come from, especially when they had a very small congregation as it was so new?

I don't know where all this money comes from, but I would like a new kitchen for my house.  As for the pastor who was selling the Espresso machine, here is a quote from his church website:  ""When I'm not at the church, you'll probably find me enjoying a good cup of coffee or out fishing.""

**About My Place**

**Saint Petersburg is recognized as one of the top small cities to live in the United States.** It’s a cool, hip, and youthful city with a vibrant atmosphere—offering all the best aspects of urban living without the big-city problems. My unit is just five short blocks from the incredibly scenic North Bay Trail, a walk/run/bike path that winds along the city’s waterfront and through its interconnected park system.

**Features:**

* Quiet low-rise building
* A/C and heat
* En-suite washer and dryer
* Dishwasher, microwave, fridge and stove
* Ceiling fans
* Ultra clean
* Parking spot
* Building facilities include outdoor patio, martini pool, club room, and small workout room with basic equipment. (Crunch Fitness is only two blocks away)

**Location**

* 6 nearby supermarkets: Whole Foods (1 block) 2 Publix stores (2 blocks), Trader Joes (1 mile), Fresh Market (0.9 mile), Rollin' Oats health food/organic market (1.5 miles)
* Just a few short blocks to the North Bay Trail — an interconnected 6.5 mile pathway between Coffee Pot Boulevard and Vinoy Park is a multi-use recreational path that stretches along the city's waterfront. This trail offers a picturesque route for walking, jogging, and cycling, providing views of Tampa Bay, downtown St. Petersburg, and historic neighborhoods.
* Dolphins, sea rays, cranes, and other exotic birds are just some of the wildlife you’ll encounter during your walk or ride along the North Bay Trail.
* Nearby tennis, volleyball and pickleball courts, outdoor pools and recreational centers

**The City**

St. Petersburg boasts a vibrant arts scene, featuring numerous galleries and museums, including the Salvador Dalí Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts. The city also offers a wealth of outdoor activities, thanks to its miles of shoreline along Tampa Bay, Boca Ciega Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, and intercostal waterways. Residents enjoy a mild climate with an average of 361 days of sunshine per year, rightfully earning St. Pete the nickname “The Sunshine City.”

**Timeframe**

I'm looking for mid-September for a period of 4 months to 6 months, with some flexibility regarding the exact dates. While September in St. Petersburg can still be quite warm, the fall season truly shines. By October, the weather becomes exceptionally pleasant—sunny, mild, and ideal for enjoying the outdoors.

1ktotgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ktotgr/something_took_my_friends_on_a_school_trip_to_utah/,Something took my friends on a school trip to Utah,"What I’m about to describe is my personal account of an accident that happened about six years ago in Utah. If you’re from the area, you might have heard about it on the local news. For whatever reason, it never made national headlines—one of my theories being that it got overshadowed, as a massive political scandal was happening at the time, but I don't have an explanation. It’s as if the world simply brushed it off and continued onwards. But not us.

To our school, it was a tragedy that caused years of mourning. It broke families and took away best friends. A haunting event that, to this day, nobody fully understands.

Nobody except me.

I never told anyone what really happened that night. Partly because I never had a solid reason to, but mostly because my story is so absurd it borders on unbelievable. I figured people would write it off as trauma-induced delusion and told myself not to bother trying to convince them. So, I buried it—kept it to myself for years. The authorities knew the when and where and families got to bury their loved ones. It was officially chalked up to a freak incident of nature.

And in a twisted way, they weren’t wrong.

So in a way, you could say I wasn’t hurting anyone by hiding the truth. Today, however, I’ve decided to finally share what I’ve kept hidden for so long. Keep in mind, I don’t know how to explain what happened and you might end up just as confused as I am. Whether you choose to believe me or not is up to you.

It was the end of our final year of middle school. I was around 15 at the time. Exams were done, the stress was behind us and summer vacations loomed. Despite that, some of us were sad to leave our small private school in California, especially that it had a family feel that I hadn’t experienced before, given the number of students was lower than in an average educational facility. I moved schools often due to my parents’ constant relocation, but this place felt different than any school I had attended before.

To celebrate and shake away the bitterness, people started talking about organizing something fun before we inevitably parted ways. There were talks of going to New York—maybe even an ambitious trip to Europe or Asia, but the organizers ran into too many issues trying to plan something on that scale. That’s when someone suggested a wildlife resort in Utah called the Brown Coyote Resort. It wasn’t as exciting as the other options, but it felt safe, easy to organize, and a chance to spend time in nature—something us city kids could really use. Surprisingly, it was also cheap for what looked like a luxury resort to most of us. It had pools, bowling alleys, cozy wooden lodges, and natural scenery that anyone could appreciate—it all sounded perfect.

About a week later, we were on a bus packed with teenagers, excited and carefree, awaiting an adventure in Utah. We had no idea what was coming and frankly, I really miss that time.

The first day went smoothly. We arrived tired after a long ride. Teachers handed out room assignments, sparking the usual complaints and attempts to switch with other students. Some were already plotting to sneak into other rooms at night. We ate dinner that was waiting for us, unpacked, and spent some time in the outdoor pools and game areas. I was playing volleyball in the pool with a few other students and two teachers—one for each team. We weren’t allowed to use a real ball because our caretakers feared we’d break windows or hurt other guests, so we used a beach ball instead. I was exhausted after a long day and eventually got out to dry off. Just then, someone hit the ball too hard, and a gust of wind carried the air filled object beyond the resort’s fence, toward the woods. Since I was already dry and outside the pool, everyone nagged me to get it. I hopped the fence and looked for the ball. I saw it near a small cabin, probably rented by other guests.

I picked it up and was about to return when something caught my eye deep in the woods. A pair of glowing eyes stared back at me from the darkness. I jumped and squinted my eyes, trying to make sure I wasn't just seeing things. I couldn’t make out what it was exactly. The figure seemed roughly human-sized, but the thick darkness skewed my efforts to determine its size. The only detail I could really make out was that it was bipedal and stood completely still, as if studying my every move.

“Did you fall asleep out there?!” someone yelled, snapping me out of my trance. I was about to head back to the resort, but turned to face the woods one last time.

The eyes were gone.

That night, some guys in my room schemed to sneak into the girls’ room on the other side of our hallway and brainstormed a plan on how not to get caught. I was too tired to entertain it and decided to just call it a day—my friends called me a killjoy for it. Still, my mind kept circling back to what I saw. Was it just a reflection? A hallucination? An animal? At that point, I wasn’t entirely sure. Eventually, exhaustion won and I drifted off to sleep.

Day Two: We were forced to sit through a lecture about local wildlife from one of the seemingly sleep-deprived guides. Of course, even weeks before graduation, our school needed an excuse to make this trip educational in the dullest and most uninspired way possible. After what felt like forever, finally, something interesting happened. The guide decided to show us a live feed from a nearby protected area. It was deer season, and we saw a few of them grazing around.

I zoned out a bit, watching the peaceful animals living their lives on a sunny day surrounded by nature. It was way more entertaining than listening to a middle-aged man in dire need of coffee. That was, until something spooked the deer and caused them to run off into the distance. Every one of us seemed to notice—even the guide paused his lecture.

He chalked it up to coyotes or another predator making noise, maybe even one of the deer snapping a twig and scaring the others, though the camera had no audio to confirm any of those theories. To me, however, something felt horribly wrong about the whole situation. It didn’t look like they were spooked by a noise. It looked like pure panic, like something truly terrifying just happened off-screen. My stomach twisted into knots. I tried to dismiss it as lingering anxiety from the night before, but I couldn’t shake off the weird feeling that stuck with me long after that moment. It was almost like some primal instinct inside me was trying to send me a warning. The two reflective marbles in the woods were still staring into my soul in my memory. I barely remember the rest of the day. My focus was all over the place, and the memory of the activities is quite foggy to me. I couldn’t sleep much that night either.

Day Three was more relaxed. We visited some monuments, explored rare plant life, and spent time at a nearby lake. Some of us even got to ride sailboats. For a brief moment, I felt like a kid again—away from the dread that had been following me lately. It was exactly what I needed to ease my nerves. It was a great time.

The fourth day—the last—was meant to be free. We could enjoy the resort however we liked. That evening, we went on a short hike along a safe trail, accompanied by some teachers and resort workers. We split into two groups and played a game to make things a bit more fun before ending the trip. One group would write challenges on paper for the other group to find and record themselves doing, my group being the one that was to brainstorm the tasks. The guides were to make sure the papers were easy to find and wouldn’t drift off somewhere and pollute the environment.

It proved to be quite effective at entertaining us. Everyone was laughing and trying to come up with funny or surreal challenges. A lot of times our teachers had to step in, as some suggestions were either inappropriate or too extreme—something to be expected from teenagers. During that activity, however, I couldn’t shake off the feeling we were being followed, but seeing everyone else so carefree, I forced myself to ignore it.

I wanted to enjoy the last days with my classmates before parting ways after graduation. I didn’t want to let my paranoia ruin that for me. After all, this was the last time I would see everyone in this setting—a chance to build memories I would never get back. With that in mind, I tried all I could to relax and join my friends in suggesting funny things for the notes we left.

It was then I saw something that made my heart jump into my throat. The guide immediately stopped us, and even they went pale. It was a corpse of a deer, lying right in the middle of the trail. To say the body was massacred would be an understatement. It had claw marks on its side—two of which were especially huge and deep, followed by bite marks all over its neck, with a ton of flesh ripped off. It was especially shocking, as we were told this area was free of bears and cougars, and the smaller predators in the area wouldn’t have been capable of such assault. The placement of the body also felt very wrong. It was almost as if something had dragged it there on purpose knowing we would be passing through eventually.

To add salt to the injury, one of our teachers received a phone call that changed the entire tone of the event. Two of our classmates from Group 2 had gone missing. They were a pretty well-known couple at our school. The girl—let's call her Vanessa—was a big adrenaline junkie, and the two of them were known for being irresponsible. It was easy to imagine her convincing her boyfriend to sneak off somewhere once the guides weren’t looking. Idiotic, but completely on-brand for them.

Given all the developments, the staff decided to call the game off and head back to the resort. Police and rescue teams were contacted. Some of us were allowed to help search the safer areas, while trained professionals searched deeper into the woods. I joined the search for a while. We called their names, used flashlights, they brought in police dogs and even helicopters. But the hours ticked by with no results. Eventually, some of us, including me, grew too exhausted to continue, and we were escorted back to the Brown Coyotes.

Back inside, I sat in a room with a few other kids. Only one teacher and the receptionist were around. We were mostly unsupervised and still scared, but also oddly carefree in the way only tired, traumatized teens can be. We used the moment to play games and stay up late despite everything. It was our last attempt to salvage something from this trip. We talked about what might have happened to them. Some mentioned the deer corpse. Others said they felt a presence following them during the hike. It seemed I wasn’t the only one who had that gut feeling. Still, I stayed quiet.

By 1 a.m., I’d had enough. The entire situation didn’t mix well with the anxiety I’d been feeling since day one. Thinking back now, I don’t know why I never told them about the eyes I saw in the woods. I guess I’ve always had a bad habit of keeping important things to myself.

After the conversations turned more stressful, I made my way back to my room. It was empty and silent. I opened one of the windows and took a few deep breaths. The warm air felt nice, and the view was calming to my overstimulated brain. I could see an empty road faintly lit by a few streetlamps. In the distance stood the forest, and beyond that, the mountains. Everything seemed peaceful, like all the commotion had paused just for this one moment.

I knew that somewhere in those woods were rescuers, police, teachers, resort staff, and my classmates—probably worried sick. I couldn’t imagine what it was like to be one of the teachers in this situation. I sat there for a while, because being alone was exactly what I needed at that moment.

It was then I saw something move in the distance.. 

It walked alongside the road. At first, I couldn’t tell whether it was an animal or a human, but as it got closer, I began to recognize its features. It walked on two legs and was roughly the height of a tall human—maybe six feet. But its silhouette was much more than just tall. It was long. Reptilian in shape, with a lizard-like snout, bulky legs, and a long tail. Its head bobbed slightly in a bird-like manner as it moved and in its jaws, it carried something long.

As it passed beneath one of the streetlamps, its form became even more horrifyingly clear.

Its body was covered in dusky gray feathers, darker along its spine. Its snout was stained crimson with blood. Its arms ended in three razor-sharp claws, and long feathers along its forearms gave the illusion of wings. Its powerful legs ended in talons, each foot featuring one massive raised and hooked claw. It looked sharper than a kitchen knife. In its partly opened jaws, I saw a set of glistening teeth gripping a human leg dressed in ripped light denim jeans—the same jeans I remembered Vanessa wearing earlier that day.

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. I was frozen, staring as it carefully placed the leg under the streetlamp, almost as if it wanted us to find it, playing a twisted game of intimidation.

Then it looked around, its head twitching in sharp, birdlike movements. It scanned its surroundings, until it looked directly at.. me.

I ducked beneath the window, my heart pounding. It saw me. 

I began hyperventilating, my mind spinning out of control. Fight or flight kicked in as I quickly sprang into a different empty room fearing it might try to break in through the fragile window. I pushed a dresser in front of the door to barricade myself and crawled under the bed. It was all I could think to do.

Then I remembered—I wasn’t the only one in the building.

I tried to force myself to move, to warn everyone. But it was too late. The first screams rang out from downstairs. The floor was wooden so it carried vibrations very well, giving me a horrifying insight into the scene downstairs. One by one I heard bodies slamming against the ground, screams and cries for help one by one dying down. I heard attempts to flee, followed by more thuds against the wooden floor. Whether it was looking for me or not, it already made its way inside and managed to kill a bunch of people.

I wanted to run. I wanted to save them. I wanted to steal a car and be anywhere else but here. But all I could do was sit there, frozen, and listen to a massacre unfold beneath me.

I've heard loud stomps. Whatever was walking along the hallway outside my room now was too heavy to be a human. I could hear a sound of low rumbling and clicking—almost like I was listening to a bass boosted emu combined with a grizzly bear or an alligator, sending unnatural vibrations throught my body. 

One by one the steps edged closer. It wasn’t moving at random—it was listening. I could hear it pause every few steps, soaking in the silence, as if waiting to catch the faintest sign of life. Each still moment stretched like an eternity, the tension growing to unbearable levels. For whatever reason, the creature kept emitting weird low frequency sounds, which I could feel almost in my skeleton. To my detriment—I could barely control how much my body was shaking and how hard it was to mask my terrified breaths. I tried to cover my mouth with my hand as I panicked over whether this thing could actually hear me or not. 

Thats when it started. The scratches. I could feel my heart pounding so hard it threatened to jump out of my chest, while the razor sharp claws of my pursuer began studying the entrance to my room. It knew where I was and was now trying to figure out how to get inside. How to get to ME. I heard the door handle go down slowly as the only thing blocking them was the dresser. Realizing its efforts weren't enough, I heard it pounding on the door as if it was trying to kick its way through. Loud slam, followed by another. I was convinced I was reaching my final moments alive. My life flashed in front of my eyes as I heard the monster pounding on the door. I wasn't ready to die. Not like this. 

As it seemed the doors might give in soon, out of nowhere another scream could be heard. It seemed like one of the girls sleeping in a room near me decided to check on the noise and witnessed the monstrosity punding on my door with force. I've heard an attempt to run followed by quick heavy steps and a loud slam against the the floor once again. Sounds of agony came next. There wasn't a roar or even a growl like one would expect a monster like this to make. Just quick and precise assault of what seemed like a definition of an apex predator. Another innocent life taken away, I could hear the girl begging for help as the thing was likely eating her alive pinning her against the ground with its talons. Seeing the sheer size of them, I can't even imagine the pain she must have been feeling at that moment. The struggle slowly became lesser and lesser as the only thing left was a sound of flesh being ripped off and chewed on. 

After what felt like an eternity, it began moving again. For whatever reason, the heavy footsteps slowly faded into the distance… until there was only silence. Shortly after that, someone opened the front door and shouted a loud “Oh God”. The others were back to witness the massacre that had transpired downstairs. The monster must have realized more humans were coming back and fled. It is only thanks to that I lived to see another day. 

Everything after that is a blur. I remember the hospital. The questions. The numbness. The crushing weight of realization.

Seven people died that night—including the missing couple. Their bodies were later found deep in the forest, unrecognizable. I could have warned someone, said something, anythibg.. but I never did. Now I have to live with that. 

The official report? A bear attack. They claimed a black bear wandered into the resort and felt threatened. They even speculated there might have been multiple bears, considering the body count.

What a joke.

But it seemed to be enough to give people closure. The Brown Coyote resort shut down after that. Ironically, you won’t find any information about it online. Thinking back, if anyone in the government knew the truth, they probably did cover it up to avoid panic. That might explain the lack of media coverage. I mean, six out of seven people who lost their lives that night were mere children, thinking about it now, I can't believe how this managed to slip under the radar. 

Our school mourned. It was the worst tragedy in its history.

I never left California after that. Despite everything, I graduated high school. I’ve avoided forests like a plague for the past six years. Recently however, I was forced to find a new place to live—and I found the perfect apartment on the outskirts of my hometown. The only downside? Its close proximity to a nearby forest. I didn’t want to take it, but my poor economic situation left me with little choice.

Every time I look at those trees… I feel them staring back. It could just be trauma. It most likely is. But that doesn’t change one thing:

by Edward Abbey  
  
***Monday, April 1st, 1985. University of Montana.*** *Edward Abbey approaches the speaking podium brandishing his Colt pistol in one hand, a bottle of Chivas Regal whiskey in the other, and delivers the following speech “before a rowdy crowd of five to six hundred students, ranchers, and instant rednecks (transplanted Easterners).”*  
  
When I first came West in 1948, a student at the University of New Mexico, I was only twenty years old and just out of the Army. I thought, like most simple-minded Easterners, that a cowboy was a kind of mythic hero. I idolized those scrawny little red-nosed hired hands in their tight jeans, funny boots and comical hats.  
Like other new arrivals in the West, I could imagine nothing more romantic than becoming a cowboy. Nothing more glorious than owning my own little genuine working cattle outfit. About the only thing better, I thought, was to be a big-league baseball player. I never dreamed that I'd eventually sink to writing books for a living. Unluckily for me—coming from an Appalachian hillbilly background and with a poor choice of parents—I didn't have much money. My father was a small-time logger. He ran a one-man sawmill and a submarginal side-hill farm. There wasn't any money in our family, no inheritance you could run ten thousand cattle on. I had no trust fund to back me up. No Hollywood movie deals to finance a land acquisition program. I lived on what in those days was called the GI Bill, which paid about $150 a month while I went to school. I made that last as long as I could—five or six years. I couldn't afford a horse. The best I could do in 1947 and '48 was buy a third-hand Chevy sedan and roam the West, mostly the Southwest, on holidays and weekends.  
I had a roommate at the University of New Mexico. I'll call him Mac. He came from a little town in southwest New Mexico where his father ran a feed store. Mackie was a fair bronc rider, eager to get into the cattle-growing business. And he had some money, enough to buy a little cinderblock house and about forty acres in the Sandia Mountains east of Albuquerque, near a town we called Landfill. Mackie fenced those forty acres, built a corral, and kept a few horses there, including an occasional genuine bronco for fun and practice.  
I don't remember exactly how Mackie and I became friends in the first place. I was majoring in classical philosophy. He was majoring in screw-worm management. But we got to know each other through the mutual pursuit of a pair of nearly inseparable Kappa Kappa Gamma girls. I lived with him in his little cinderblock house. Helped him meet the mortgage payments. Helped him meet the girls. We were both crude, shy, ugly, obnoxious—like most college boys.  
\[*Interjection: ""Like you!""\]*  
My friend Mac also owned a 1947 black Lincoln convertible, the kind with the big grille in the front, like a cowcatcher on a locomotive, chrome-plated. We used to race to classes in the morning, driving the twenty miles from his house to the campus in never more than fifteen minutes. Usually Mac was too hung over to drive, so I'd operate the car, clutching the wheel while Mac sat beside me waving his big .44, taking potshots at jackrabbits and road signs and bill boards and beer bottles. Trying to wake up in time for his ten o'clock class in brand inspection.  
I'm sorry to say that my friend Mac was a little bit gun-happy. Most of his forty acres was in tumbleweed. He fenced in about half an acre with chicken wire and stocked that little pasture with white rabbits. He used it as a target range. Not what you'd call sporting, I suppose, but we did eat the rabbits. Sometimes we even went deer hunting with handguns. Mackie with his revolver, and me with a chrome-plated Colt .45 automatic I had liberated from the US Army over in Italy. Surplus government property.  
On one of our deer-hunting expeditions, I was sitting on a log in a big clearing in the woods, thinking about Plato and Aristotle and the Kappa Kappa Gamma girls. I didn't really care whether we got a deer that day or not. It was a couple of days before opening, anyway. The whole procedure was probably illegal as hell. Mac was out in the woods somewhere looking for deer around the clearing. I was sitting on the log, thinking, when I saw a chip of bark fly away from the log all by itself, about a foot from my left hand. Then I heard the blast of Mac's revolver—that big old .44 he'd probably liberated from his father. Then I heard him laugh.  
""That's not very funny,"" Mackie,"" I said.  
""Now don't whine and complain, Ed,"" he said. ""You want to be a real hunter like me, you gotta learn to stay awake.""  
We never did get a deer with the handguns. But that's when I had my first little doubts about Mackie, and about the cowboy type in general. But I still loved him. Worshipped him, in fact. I was caught in the grip of the Western myth. Anybody said a word to me against cowboys, I'd jump down his throat with my spurs on. Especially if Mac was standing nearby.  
Sometimes I'd try to ride those broncs that he brought in, trying to prove that I could be a cowboy too. Trying to prove it more to myself than to him. I'd be on this crazy, crackpot horse going up, down left, right, and inside out. Hanging on to the saddle horn with both hands. While Mac sat on the corral fence, throwing beer bottles at us and laughing. Every time I got thrown off, Mac would say, ""Now get right back on there, Ed. Quick, quick. Don't spoil 'im.""  
It took me a long time to realize I didn't have to do that kind of work. And it took me another thirty years to realize that there's something wrong at the heart of our most popular American myth—the cowboy and his cow.  
\[*Jeers.*\]  
You may have guessed by now that I'm thinking of criticizing the livestock industry. And you are correct. I've been thinking about cows and sheep for many years. Getting more and more disgusted with the whole business. Western cattlemen are nothing more than welfare parasites. They've been getting a free ride on the public lands for over a century, and I think it's time we phased it out. I'm in favor of putting the public-lands livestock grazers out of business.  
First of all, we don't need the public-lands beef industry. Even beef lovers don't need it. According to most government reports (Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service), only about 2 percent of our beef, our red meat, comes from the public lands of the eleven Western states. By those eleven I mean Montana, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho, Wyoming, Oregon, Washington, and California. Most of our beef, aside from imports, comes from the Midwest and the East, especially the Southeast—Georgia, Alabama, Florida—and from other private lands across the nation. More beef cattle are raised in the state of Georgia than in the sagebrush empire of Nevada. And for a very good reason: back East, you can support a cow on maybe half an acre. Out here, it takes anywhere from twenty-five to fifty acres. In the red-rock country of Utah, the rule of thumb is one section—a square mile—per cow.  
\[*Shouts from rear of hall*.\]  
Since such a small percentage of cows are produced on public lands in the West, eliminating that part of the industry should not raise supermarket beef prices very much. Furthermore, we'd save money in the taxes we now pay for various subsidies to these public-lands cattlemen. Subsidies for things like ""range improvement""—tree chaining, sagebrush clearing, mesquite poisoning, disease control, predator trapping, fencing, wells, stockponds, roads. Then there are the salaries of those who work for government agencies like the BLM and the Forest Service. You could probably also count in a big part of the salaries of the overpaid professors engaged in range-management research at the Western land-grant colleges.  
Moreover, the cattle have done, and are doing, intolerable damage to our public lands—our national forests, state lands, BLM-administered lands, wildlife preserves, even some of our national parks and monuments. In Utah's Capital Reef National Park, for example, grazing is still allowed. In fact, it's recently been extended for another ten years, and Utah politicians are trying to make the arrangement permanent. They probably won't get away with it. But there we have at least one case where cattle are still tramping about in a national park, transforming soil and grass into dust and weeds.  
\[*Disturbance.\]*  
Overgrazing is much too weak a term. Most of the public lands in the West, and especially in the Southwest, are what you might call ""cowburnt."" Almost anywhere and everywhere you go in the American West you find hordes of these ugly, clumsy, stupid, bawling, stinking, fly-covered, shit-smeared, disease-spreading brutes. They are a pest and a plague. They pollute our springs and streams and rivers. They infest our canyons, valleys, meadows, and forests. They graze off the native bluestem and grama and bunch grasses, leaving behind jungles of prickly pear. They trample down the native forbs and shrubs and cacti. They spread the exotic cheatgrass, the Russian thistle, and the crested wheat grass. *Weeds.*  
Even when the cattle are not physically present, you'll see the dung and the flies and the mud and the dust and the general destruction. If you don't see it, you'll smell it. The whole American West stinks of cattle. Along every flowing stream, around every seep and spring and water hole and well, you'll find acres and acres of what range-management specialists call ""sacrifice areas""—another understatement. These are places denuded of forage, except for some cactus or a little tumbleweed or maybe a few mutilated trees like mesquite, juniper, or hackberry.  
I'm not going to bombard you with graphs and statistics, which don't make much of an impression on intelligent people anyway. Anyone who goes beyond the city limits of almost any Western town can see for himself that the land is overgrazed. There are too many cows and horses and sheep out there. Of course, cattlemen would never publicly confess to overgrazing, any more than Dracula would publicly confess to a fondness for blood. Cattlemen are interested parties. Many of them will not give reliable testimony. Some have too much at stake: their Cadillacs and their airplanes, their ranch resale profits and their capital gains. (I'm talking about the corporation ranchers, the land-and-cattle companies, the investment syndicates.) Others, those ranchers who have only a small base property, flood the public lands with their cows. About 8 percent of federal land permittees have cattle that consume approximately 45 percent of the forage on the government rangelands.  
Beef ranchers like to claim that their cows do not compete with deer. Deer are browsers, cows are grazers. That's true. But when a range is overgrazed, when the grass is gone (as it often is for seasons at a time), then cattle become browsers too, out of necessity. In the Southwest, cattle commonly feed on mesquite, cliff rose, cactus, acacia, or any other shrub or tree they find biodegradable. To that extent, they compete with deer. And they tend to drive out other and better wildlife. Like elk, or bighorn sheep, or pronghorn antelope.  
\[*Sneers, jeers, laughter.\]*  
How much damage have cattle done to the Western rangelands? Large-scale beef ranching has been going on since the 1870s. There's plenty of documentation of the effects of this massive cattle grazing on the erosion of the land, the character of the land, the character of the vegetation. Streams and rivers that used to flow on the surface all year round are now intermittent, or underground, because of overgrazing and rapid runoff.  
Our public lands have been overgrazed for a century. The BLM knows it; the Forest Service knows it. The Government Accounting Office knows it. And overgrazing means eventual ruin, just like stripmining or clear-cutting or the damming of rivers. Much of the Southwest already looks like Mexico or southern Italy or North Africa: a cowburnt wasteland. As we destroy our land, we destroy our agricultural economy and the basis of modern society. If we keep it up, we'll gradually degrade American life to the status of life in places like Mexico or southern Italy or Libya or Egypt.  
In 1984 the Bureau of Land Management, which was required by Congress to report on its stewardship of our rangelands—the property of all Americans, remember—confessed that 31 percent of the land it administered was in ""good condition,"" and 60 percent was in ""poor condition."" And it reported that only 18 percent of the rangelands were improving, while 68 percent were ""stable"" and 14 percent were getting worse. If the BLM said that, we can safely assume that range conditions are actually much worse.  
\[*Shouts of ""bullshit!""\]*  
What can we do about this situation? This is the fun part—this is the part I like. It's not easy to argue that we should do away with cattle ranching. The cowboy myth gets in the way. But I do have some solutions to overgrazing.  
\[*A yell: ""Cowboys do it better!"" Answered by another: ""Ask any cow!"" Coarse laughter.\]*  
I'd begin by reducing the number of cattle on public lands. Not that range managers would go along with it, of course. In their eyes, and in the eyes of the livestock associations they work for, cutting down on the number of cattle is the worst possible solution—an impossible solution. So they propose all kinds of gimmicks. Portable fencing and perpetual movement of cattle. More cross-fencing. More wells and ponds so that more land can be exploited. These proposals are basically a maneuver by the Forest Service and the BLM to appease their critics without offending their real bosses in the beef industry. But a drastic reduction in cattle number is the only true and honest solution.  
I also suggest that we open a hunting season on range cattle. I realize that beef cattle will not make sporting prey at first. Like all domesticated animals (including most humans), beef cattle are slow, stupid, and awkward. But the breed will improve if hunted regularly. And as the number of cattle is reduced, other and far more useful, beautiful, and interesting animals will return to the range lands and will increase.  
Suppose, by some miracle of Hollywood or inheritance or good luck, I should acquire a respectable-sized working cattle outfit. What would I do with it? First I'd get rid of the stinking, filthy cattle. Every single animal. Shoot them all, and stock the place with real animals, real game, real protein: elk, buffalo, pronghorn antelope, bighorn sheep, moose. And some purely decorative animals, like eagles. We need more eagles. And wolves. We need more wolves. Mountain lions and bears. Especially, of course, grizzly bears. Down in the desert, I would stock every water tank, every water hole, every stockpond, with alligators.  
You may note that I have said little about coyotes or deer. Coyotes seem to be doing all right on their own. They're smarter than their enemies. I've never heard of a coyote as dumb as a sheepman. As for deer, especially mule deer, they, too, are surviving—maybe even thriving, as some game and fish departments claim, though nobody claims there are as many deer now as there were before the cattle industry was introduced in the West. In any case, compared to elk the deer is a second-rate game animal, nothing but a giant rodent—a rat with antlers.  
\[*Portions of the audience begin to leave.\]*  
I've suggested that the beef industry's abuse of our Western lands is based on the old mythology of the cowboy as a natural nobleman. I'd like to conclude this diatribe with a few remarks about this most cherished and fanciful of American fairy tales. In truth, the cowboy is only a hired hand. A farm boy in leather britches and a comical hat. A herdsman who gets on a horse to do part of his work. Some ranchers are also cowboys, but most are not. There is a difference. There are many ranchers out there who are big time farmers of the public lands—our property. As such, they do not merit any special consideration or special privileges. There are only about 31,000 ranchers in the whole American West who use the public lands. That's less than the population of Missoula, Montana.  
The rancher (with a few honorable exceptions) is a man who strings barbed wire all over the range; drills wells and bulldozes stockponds; drives off elk and antelope and bighorn sheep; poisons coyotes and prairie dogs; shoots eagles, bears and cougars on sight; supplants the native grasses with tumbleweed, snakeweed, povertyweed, cowshit, anthills, mud, dust, and flies. And then leans back and grins at the TV cameras and talks about how much he loves the American West. Cowboys also are greatly overrated. Consider the nature of their work. Suppose you had to spend most of your working hours sitting on a horse, contemplating the hind end of a cow. How would that affect your imagination? Think what it does to the relatively simple mind of the average peasant boy, raised amid the bawling of calves and cows in the splatter of mud and the stink of shit.  
\[*Shouting. Laughter. Disturbance.\]*  
Do cowboys work hard? Sometimes. But most ranchers don't work very hard. They have a lot of leisure time for politics and bellyaching (which is why most state legislatures in the West are occupied and dominated by cattlemen). Anytime you go into a small Western town you'll find them at the nearest drugstore, sitting around all morning drinking coffee, talking about their tax breaks.  
Is a cowboy's work socially useful? No. As I've already pointed out, subsidized Western range beef is a trivial item in the national beef economy. If all of our 31,000 Western public-land ranchers quit tomorrow, we'd never even notice. Any public school teacher does harder work, more difficult work, more dangerous work, and far more valuable work than the cowboy or the rancher. The same applies to the registered nurses and nurses' aides, garbage workers, and traffic cops. Harder work, tougher work, more necessary work. We need those people in our complicated society. We do not need cowboys or ranchers. We've carried them on our backs long enough.  
\[*Disturbance in rear of hall.*\]  
""This Abbey,"" the cowboys and their lovers will say, ""this Abbey is a wimp. A chicken-hearted sentimentalist with no feel for the hard realities of practical life."" Especially critical of my attitude will be the Easterners and Midwesterners newly arrived here from their Upper West Side apartments, their rustic lodges in upper Michigan. Our nouveau Westerners with their toy ranches, their pickup trucks with the gun racks, their pointy-toed boots with the undershot heels, their gigantic hats. And of course, their pet horses. The *instant rednecks.*  
\[*Shouts.*\]  
To those who might accuse me of wimpery and sentimentality, I'd like to say this in reply. I respect real men. I admire true manliness. But I despise arrogance and brutality and bullies. So let me close with some nice remarks about cowboys and cattle ranchers. They are a mixed lot, like the rest of us. As individuals, they range from the bad to the ordinary to the good. A rancher, after all, is only a farmer, cropping the public range lands with his four-legged lawnmowers, stashing our grass into his bank account. A cowboy is a hired hand trying to make an honest living. Nothin’ special.  
I have no quarrel with these people as fellow humans. All I want to do is get their cows off our property. Let those cowboys and ranchers find some harder way to make a living, like the rest of us have to do. There's no good reason why we should subsidize them forever. They've had their free ride. It's time they learned to support themselves.  
In the meantime, I'm going to say good-bye to all you cowboys and cowgirls. I love the legend too—but keep your sacred cows and your dead horses out of my elk pastures.

I have a lovely 1 bedroom/1 bathroom unit (684 sq. foot) in St. Petersburg Florida that I'm looking to swap with someone in B.C. (anywhere coastal or scenic).

**About My Place**

**Saint Petersburg is recognized as one of the top small cities to live in the United States.** It’s a cool, hip, and youthful city with a vibrant atmosphere—offering all the best aspects of urban living without the big-city problems. My unit is just five short blocks from the incredibly scenic North Bay Trail, a walk/run/bike path that winds along the city’s waterfront and through its interconnected park system.

**Features:**

* Quiet low-rise building
* A/C and heat
* En-suite washer and dryer
* Dishwasher, microwave, fridge and stove
* Ceiling fans
* Ultra clean
* Parking spot
* Building facilities include outdoor patio, martini pool, club room, and small workout room with basic equipment. (Crunch Fitness is only two blocks away)

**Location**

* 6 nearby supermarkets: Whole Foods (1 block) 2 Publix stores (2 blocks), Trader Joes (1 mile), Fresh Market (0.9 mile), Rollin' Oats health food/organic market (1.5 miles)
* Just a few short blocks to the North Bay Trail — an interconnected 6.5 mile pathway between Coffee Pot Boulevard and Vinoy Park is a multi-use recreational path that stretches along the city's waterfront. This trail offers a picturesque route for walking, jogging, and cycling, providing views of Tampa Bay, downtown St. Petersburg, and historic neighborhoods.
* Dolphins, sea rays, cranes, and other exotic birds are just some of the wildlife you’ll encounter during your walk or ride along the North Bay Trail.
* Nearby tennis, volleyball and pickleball courts, outdoor pools and recreational centers

**The City**

St. Petersburg boasts a vibrant arts scene, featuring numerous galleries and museums, including the Salvador Dalí Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts. The city also offers a wealth of outdoor activities, thanks to its miles of shoreline along Tampa Bay, Boca Ciega Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, and intercostal waterways. Residents enjoy a mild climate with an average of 361 days of sunshine per year, rightfully earning St. Pete the nickname “The Sunshine City.”

**Timeframe**

I'm looking for mid-September for a period of 4 months to 6 months, with some flexibility regarding the exact dates. While September in St. Petersburg can still be quite warm, the fall season truly shines. By October, the weather becomes exceptionally pleasant—sunny, mild, and ideal for enjoying the outdoors.

**Please note: No-smoking or pets are allowed.**

Sure, Samsung has a tendency to oversatureate colours and exposore, but it still manages to stay closer to reality than the Pixel 9a for colour tones.

Hello lovely people! I would love some help and opinions about what the hell is going on with me please…. 

A bit about me: I’m a 33 year old female. No history of stomach issues. I don’t drink coffee, tea or alcohol. I don’t eat meat or very much spicy food. I don’t smoke. I’m a little bit overweight but fit for my size. I’ve never had any digestive issues before (I can count the times on one hand I’ve ever vomited, had heartburn and I only usually get an upset stomach before menstruation). However I have a family history of stomach issues: my mother had GERD and several stomach issues, and my grandmother had diverticulitis. Both eventually had a stoma fitted in their 60s due to issues. 

My symptoms started a month ago. It began with a dull ache in my upper abdomen (right hypochondriac area). It was agony at night and would progress to a stabbing pain at times. Very tender to the touch. It was so bad I went to the emergency room. I was told it was likely my gallbladder. I got an ultrasound… no issue with my gallbladder, so I was discharged. I was told my liver and pancreas looked normal as well, but that I had some gas/inflammation in my stomach lining. 

Went back to my Dr, I was told it might be gastroenteritis. I was treated with antibiotics (co amoxiclav) and a 2x daily PPI while I waited for an H Pylori test. This test was negative. I took the PPIs and experienced some symptom relief of the pain. I’m now off PPIs but I took another one this morning as the pain was back, and now when the pain comes, it spreads to the middle and left upper abdomen too. 

I’ve been referred for a CT scan on my abdomen next week, but the more I’ve researched, the more I’m worried they might be on the wrong track. I have a very bad taste in my mouth a lot of the time, but no heartburn or indigestion. I sometimes burp but nothing acidic or onerous. I don’t have a globus sensation or a cough (maybe a little in the morning, but I figure it’s due to allergies). Could this be atypical GERD or LPR? Anyone experienced symptoms like mine before? 

Thank you so much. ",3,1748019291.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

1ktoiv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/1ktoiv2/2_day_detailed_itinerary_how_does_it_look_and/,"2 Day detailed Itinerary, how does it look and advice on some questions","Me and a couple of my buddies are flying into Seattle for a 10 day PNW road trip, and we have 2 days designated for Olympic NP, I know the park is huge and we can spend way more time here but after talking it over we decided we will be doing 2 days here, so here is the rough Itinerary I have so far, let me know if it looks good, if I'm missing something, if its doable or we are delusional about getting it all done, and any other advice you might have

Day 1: 

\- Arrive at Mt Ellinor upper trailhead at 7am, do the hike, in and out in about 4.5 hours, done at around 11:30am

\- After the hike at 11:30am head out to Hurricane Ridge and do Hurricane Hill vis Hurricane Ridge, the drive there is about 3 hours, with a quick stop in Port Angeles for food, on the go, add about another hour to be safe, say its 4 hours to Hurricane Hill trail, be there at 3:30pm

\- Hurricane hill is about a 2 hour hike, lets say we spend 3 hours there, and leave out at 6:30pm, then on the way to lake crescent grab a quick dinner and do 1 of 3 things, hit Devils Punch Bowl do the hike and do a quick dip, hit lake crescent and chill there until sunset, or do marymere falls hike, do one of them for a bit and then go to the campsite to end the day , we plan on doing disperse camping in the area to save on money, still looking for the exact spot but right now leaning to camp at FS-2918 which doesn't look to bad

Day 2:

\-Wake up around 7am and yeah out to Sol Duc Falls trail, and be there around 7:40am, do the hike and leave out at about 9am

\-Then head out to Cape Flattery, which is about a 2 hour drive, so we will be there around 11am, and spend about an 1 hour 30 minutes there

\- After cape flattery head out to Forks, WA to grab a quick lunch, leave Forks around 2:40pm, and head out to Hoh Rainforest to do Hall of Mosses and Spruce Nature trail, we would be there at around 3:30pm, and spend 2 hours there, leave out at 5:30pm, and head out to Ruby Beach 

\- Be at Ruby Beach at 6:30pm, maybe catch low tide, and some tide pools, or just chill there before heading out to the next camping location or hotel, before hitting the Oregon coast the next day

A couple thing that I wanna say, I really wanted to try and include rialto beach, but from everything I've seen the best time to go there is during low tide and odds are at the time we will be in the area it wont be morning or afternoon, it'll just be mid day, so is it likely there wont be any low tide? Or is it still worth going to even during high tide?

I really wanted to try and also do Mount Storm King, it looks really nice but cant really fit it in, and it doesn't look better then Mt Ellinor, and from what I've seen hurricane ridge is better, so is it a fine skip or should I look to replace one of those hikes with Mount Storm king?

We will have the America the Beautiful Pass so I think that should cover all the NF fees needed and what not, but a big question I have is if anyone knows any good disperse camping spots any help would be appreciated, I have a rough idea of when we will be spending the night each day but it doesn't hurt to ask for advice, specifically if anyone knows any spots near Mt Ellinor and Lake Cushman that we can spend the night before Day 1, or anything near Lake crescent or on the way to the Oregon coast I guess

Also any good coffee or foods spots we should try and not miss

As well as any spots or hikes that would be worth swapping in for something else

Also if anyone has experience with the weather in the Olympic NP during the time frame we will be there 2 days between July 17th and 27th, is the weather usually good, or is there a chance it pours and we wont even go for hikes like Mt Storm King or Mt Ellinor?

All in all 2 days is all we have and I tried to fit as much of what I really thought stood out the most for us, trying to make the most of what time we have, we are all young and have no problem waking up early and hiking and spending and having long days, that's part of the fun and I want to see as much as we can since this is our first time in the PNW, since we are all from Ohio, I know its ambitious but let me know how the itinerary looks, thank you in advance",0,1748019257.0,OlympicNationalPark,12,0.33,False

Then I passed out in a whirl of job sites, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Indeed, speedy-apply\[.\]com, just clicking randomly, fueled by caffeine and rage. I don't even know what half of them do anymore. If one of them delivers my resume by carrier pigeon, so much the better. I'm in.



At 2 a.m., I'd applied for 47 jobs, devoured half a box of crackers, and reassured myself that I'd be in a better mood about work by Thursday.



I have no idea if I am leaving. But the next time he attempts to shove his ""urgent"" spreadsheet in my face, I'll smile, sip some coffee, and think: somewhere in the world, a computer program is interviewing for jobs on my behalf while I'm sitting around in fuzzy socks.

1ktofy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1ktofy0/the_complete_poesie_birthday_cake_collection/,The Complete Poesie Birthday Cake Collection Reviewed by Someone Who Doesn't Like Gourmands,"^(allegedly) 

Hi hello it's me. I am the titular gourmand dis-aficionado. Why the heck did I buy a collection of nothing but cake, you might ask? Am I stupid? *Yes, almost certainly.* But in this case that's not relevant. I bought them for my mom, who really only wanted two of them, but single samples were not available so. Here we are. I'm reviewing them for science, since I bought them and they are here. 'Why not?', I asked myself. 'Maybe I'll unlock something.', I mused. So anyways, here's my **very stream of conscious** reviews, as jotted down in my phone while subjecting myself to a barrage of cakes. 

**Disclaimer:** Did I let these rest for more than like.... overnight? No. I am a goblin and I have no chill. Also I was delivering the requested samples to my mom today so I had to hustle if I wanted to test them all. It makes sense if you don't think about it too hard. Also I only kinda remembered the notes of these. 

**Yellow Cake:** Oh. Ohhh. Ok. I don't.... hate this? Creamy rich vanilla... like a custard/cream filling? This makes me think of pastry more than cake. Like a cannoli or something. Wait. No,  there's cake in there.  This is much lighter/less rich and/or buttery than Sugar Spider's Caked Up. There's a vague...saltiness? Butter? But not the heavy cloying cookie butter type? It's like a cake skin scent. Idk. I don't hate it.  

*Actual notes: vanilla, butter, and custard* (I can't believe I guessed custard correctly lmao) 

**Emma:** This was the strawberry one iirc. But... is it? Maybe not? Definitely smells like cake. Like those little petit fours type cakes you get with a tea service. Hmm. *sniffing and pondering* Ok there's something in there that kind of reminds me of freezedried strawberries. The cake is less cake now. I dunno what I'm smelling. Help. One of those cookies with the sticky fruit stuff in the middle? Not a thumbprint cookie but the sandwich kind? With the cutout? That's what this reminds me of. 

*Actual notes: white cake layered with strawberry jam and juicy fresh strawberries and whipped cream* (strawberries where you at?)

**Juliet:** Ok. This smells delightful. Dead on olive oil cake with lemon and pistachio and just a dusting of cardamom. I can like.... smell the texture of it. And now I'm hungry. This smells like something my favorite local coffee shop would make. As it dries there's almost a.... white musk feel to it? A powdered sugar note maybe? I knew this would be the one I'm most likely to enjoy, and I was right! But I like Kindness + Mischief more and they are similar enough to not need both. 

*Actual notes: cardamom pistachio olive oil cake with lemon vanilla glaze* (this one I did remember the notes because it was one of the one's mom was after) 

**Scout:** Cherry? Or almond? Cherries. Like... the Candied ones? Was there a cherry one? Idk it smells like cherries or cherry-almond. And cake. On my skin it immediately goes into that cookie-butter-popcorn thing that Sorce stuff does on my skin. Rip. This actually smelled really good in the vial which is surprising because I don't like cherries irl. Cake accords do not love me. 

*Actual notes: white cake layered with candied cherries and caramelized coconut pecan frosting, and soaked in bourbon* (Ok white cake is definitely not my jam apparently. )

**Matilda:** This one was chocolate, obvs. I love chocolate but I don't love it in perfume. I remember TeaandCozy said the chocolate wasn't strong but.... it's definitely tootsie roll vibes in the bottle. Jesus take the wheel. Oh what? Ok well I'm sorry for doubting T&C. This smells like....sandalwood incense and coffee? Is there coffee? Ok this.... is nice? It reminds me of one of the Labyrinth scents. 13th Hour? Maybe? Idk. I'm trash with names. Man. Why is this so nice. It's giving 'bougie but actually really good coffee shop in a hip downtown area'. 

*Actual notes: fudgy chocolate cake with milk chocolate frosting, coffee, royal sandalwood, amber* (sorry for doubting you u/TeaAndCozy!) 

**Anne:** CARROT CAKE!!!!! OHHH MY GOD. This smells exactly like my mom's carrot cake she used to make every year for Easter!! It was shaped like a bunny and sometimes she'd add red food coloring to freak people out when they cut into it lmaoooooo. This perfume gave me insane flashbacks to childhood. Omg. I love this. What's happening. Am I into gourmands now??? HELP WHO AM I. Ok sorry. This starts out violently carrot cake with cream cheese icing. As it dries it's more spices with a creamy vanilla that still keeps a bit of that cream cheese edge. Ok. This is very in my wheelhouse. I love a good spice scent. It's not too sweet, like a good carrot cake. Between the drydown and the personal attack on my nostalgia, I will probably FS this. Poesie look at what you have done to me.

*Actual notes: carrot cake with cinnamon and pecans and cream cheese frosting* (Just in case it wasn't clear, I was really into this one. I'm wearing it right now in fact lol. And upon doing some research [aka huffing and eating many pecans] I can pick out the pecan note, it smells like the taste of pecans, more than the scent? If that makes sense? Idk. I love pecans so I was kinda excited about it.) 

And there you have it. I learned something about myself, I guess. Spiced gourmands might be nice! White cake is not my friend. Knowledge is power. Or something. There's probably a lesson in there about trying new things or whatever. Or the power of nostalgia, maybe. Who knows. Hopefully someone found these helpful or at least enjoyed them. 🫡

1ktoew8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1ktoew8/my_children_i_are_stuck_with_my_toxic_alcoholic/,My children & I are stuck with my toxic alcoholic boyfriend of 5 years. Help.,"I F(29) have been with my boyfriend M(30) for 5 years.
I have endured emotional, mental, & verbal abuse for the majority of it, stupidly convinced it was my fault for causing him to react the way he did for a very long time. 

-I definitely have some people pleasing, co dependent attachment issues, struggle with standing up for myself, & have always dealt with low self confidence & self esteem due to mean girl bullying all throughout high school. Small town high school bullying (being called a slut, hearing people insult me as I would walk thru the hallways between classes, told no one likes me, told to kill myself, etc.) The bullying got so bad that I did end up dropping out of high school a little over half way thru my junior year, getting my GED & starting to work full time at 17. (not really relevant to this story, other than giving a bit of backstory as to my self confidence issues.)-

My boyfriend and father of our children is an alcoholic, a binge alcoholic. Goes on 5-14 day binges, no memory of spans of time, blowing all his money, driving while drunk. Most recently he crashed his car, it is sitting at the dealership as we speak, & has no recollection of doing so.
We have 2 children together, our son is almost 2 and we have a 6 month old daughter.

The night our daughter was born, he had been yelling at me for hours all evening. Calling me fat, ugly, a dumb stupid cunt, a slut, etc.
Wouldn’t believe me when I said I felt that I needed to go to ER due to pain.
He also was way too drunk to drive me (I hadn’t realized how much he had already drank.) Due to the back & forth for hours between us, & his yelling/name calling, I believe I wasn’t as focused on the pain as I should have been & went to the bathroom to what I thought fart or poop. Not even 30 seconds later, our daughter was making her entrance into the world in the bathroom at our apartment.
He was too drunk to call 911 as I was screaming at him to do so, he was making fun of me & continuing to call me names not understanding the severity of what had just happened. So I called 911 while sitting on the toilet, our newborn wrapped in a towel. EMTs and police arrived within minutes thankfully.

Our daughter was/is perfectly fine. A healthy happy little 6 month old chunk now. 
He was instructed by police officers that responded to the 911 call not to drive to the hospital, he was being incredibly loud & over the top when he arrived at the hospital with my mom, almost acting as if he was out at a bar. I was incredibly embarrassed with the situation to begin with as I felt I was already being judged for not getting to the hospital in time, & how he was acting made everything 10 times worse. 
He doesn’t have any recollection of our daughter being born, or the events that followed. I was so in the moment & overwhelmed, I let him pick out her name at the hospital, as we hadn’t decided on one yet. If i would have known how drunk he was, I never would have given him the privilege. Although I love her name, I would be lying if I said it didn’t give me a sadness & guilt, due to how her name came to be.

He left me alone in the hospital for the 2 nights our daughter & I were in there, so he could come back home & drink. Lying to me the entire time telling me he wasn’t. Blowing my phone up one night that I was in the hospital, telling me I was cheating on him. Mind you I had just birthed our daughter at our apartment maybe 24 hours previously.

When I found out I was pregnant with our first, he convinced me to quit my job & be a full time stay at home mom, which I wasn’t opposed to.
Except now, he withholds all money from me. Does not get things for our children when we need (diapers, formula, new paci’s, etc.) I have to rely on my parents most of the time for those things. I am beyond blessed and grateful to have the parents I do.
He calls me lazy, insults my work ethic, makes fun of the fact that “i have no skill set,” calls everything in our apartment his, even the apartment itself even though we are both in the lease. Screams at me to gtfo multiple times a week.
Screams at me & belittles me in front of our children. Tells me our children will grow up to hate me.

He goes to work and comes home to sit on his game, headset on, ignoring me & the children, usually yelling at me or his game until I get our children to bed. 
I am then expected to have sex with him, or I am told that I must be cheating on him. Or I’m called a whore, gross, or comments are made about my body post pregnancies. All this with him knowing I have battled anorexia & disordered eating since I was 15 years old.
Most recently I found that he had a secret tinder & Snap. He made me delete all of my social medias months ago because he was convinced I was cheating on him.
I was scolded for getting on his phone & finding the Tinder & Snap, even tho he had just given me his password & put my face ID on his phone during a day he was acting “nice.” He says it’s not a big deal, because he only talked to 1 or 2 girls on snap, & a few on Tinder. Just casual conversation, nothing sexual, no pictures sent or received. Not that I really believe that.

He threatens violence, mostly if he has been drinking but sometimes sober. This has started more recently, after the birth of our daughter. Talks about either buying or already owning a gun (i know he does not
own one currently, I think he just says that in hopes to scare me.) He has shoved me while I was holding our son, a few times. He has choked me, picking me up by my neck & slamming me down onto our coffee table that broke. His mother was a witness, although she enables his behavior & regularly lies for him so I only have photos of the aftermath of things. He’s broken thru 3 separate bedroom doors, each time because I’ve tried going into our bedroom with our children to get away from him & his screaming.
He has gone to jail once due to domestic, but the charges were dropped because the next morning I spoke to the prosecutor & recounted some of what I had said, essentially helping him get out of the charges.

I know, incredibly stupid. I have been gaslit and manipulated for such a long time, while also trying to keep myself together for our children that I sometimes don’t know what actually happened vs if I might be overreacting. He has me convinced he is this was because of the things that happened to him & the environment he grew up in as a child, which I can empathize with to a certain extent. He just doesn’t do anything to change the way he acts.

I have a laundry list of worries that come with leaving, however one of my biggest ones is what if he is given 50/50 or worse..full custody if I do leave & we go thru the whole court process, because he has a stable well paying job to support our kids & I do not. I also now have a gap in my resume due to him & I agreeing that I would stay at home with our kids as to avoid the cost of daycare.

My parents are in a place where they can fully support myself & my children, while giving me an apartment to stay in while I get myself back on my feet as far as finding work again.
I am just so terrified that I will be looked at as lesser, or not as fit for the children to be with solely based on the job situation.

I am their primary caretaker, have been for their entire lives. I do not feel it is safe for them to be in his care by themselves, as he has shown multiple times that he will drink to the point of blacking out & still try to care/pick up our children with me here. Stumbling around with them, or just neglecting them due to being so drunk. 
Since he technically hasn’t been in any legal trouble other than a public intoxication charge he had gotten 10+ years ago, I am scared to death that since I don’t technically have proof of him being dangerous, he won’t have any kind of “rules” or “stipulations” put in place deeming him safe to care for our children alone.
Aside from countless recordings of him screaming at me or just yelling in general, photos of the damage in the aftermath of him raging, & countless texts from him vaguely threatening me, admitting to drinking & driving, just overall being a vile person. 
I feel that I don’t have much to prove how much of a danger he truly is.

I have endured emotional, mental, & verbal abuse for the majority of it, stupidly convinced it was my fault for causing him to react the way he did for a very long time. 

-I definitely have some people pleasing, co dependent attachment issues, struggle with standing up for myself, & have always dealt with low self confidence & self esteem due to mean girl bullying all throughout high school. Small town high school bullying (being called a slut, hearing people insult me as I would walk thru the hallways between classes, told no one likes me, told to kill myself, etc.) The bullying got so bad that I did end up dropping out of high school a little over half way thru my junior year, getting my GED & starting to work full time at 17. (not really relevant to this story, other than giving a bit of backstory as to my self confidence issues.)-

My boyfriend and father of our children is an alcoholic, a binge alcoholic. Goes on 5-14 day binges, no memory of spans of time, blowing all his money, driving while drunk. Most recently he crashed his car, it is sitting at the dealership as we speak, & has no recollection of doing so.
We have 2 children together, our son is almost 2 and we have a 6 month old daughter.

The night our daughter was born, he had been yelling at me for hours all evening. Calling me fat, ugly, a dumb stupid cunt, a slut, etc.
Wouldn’t believe me when I said I felt that I needed to go to ER due to pain.
He also was way too drunk to drive me (I hadn’t realized how much he had already drank.) Due to the back & forth for hours between us, & his yelling/name calling, I believe I wasn’t as focused on the pain as I should have been & went to the bathroom to what I thought fart or poop. Not even 30 seconds later, our daughter was making her entrance into the world in the bathroom at our apartment.
He was too drunk to call 911 as I was screaming at him to do so, he was making fun of me & continuing to call me names not understanding the severity of what had just happened.

For some background, I didn't believe that she was staying in the city I live in (she's a travel nurse), and I believed she was dishonest about other things because when I asked her if there were issues we should discuss, she brushed me off. I couldn't trust her words when realizing she hid her true feelings. Why would she text me this instead of just leaving?

I (M, 21) had been seeing a girl (F, 25) casually for a month. There was solid chemistry, we slept together multiple times, flirted often, joked around a lot — overall a fun connection. She’s a travel nurse in my city until July.

Last week, she sent the “I’m not really feeling a romantic spark” text and offered to stay friends. I took it on the chin — said I respect her honesty, no hard feelings, and we had a quick call where the vibe still felt good, even playful.

Since then, we’ve still been texting. I’ve kept it light, teasing, confident — no needy energy. She’s still engaging, laughing, and we even made coffee plans after the “let’s just be friends” talk. I’ve subtly flirted a bit, dropped casual lines about the vibe still being there, etc. She’s responded well — not over-the-top, but not shutting it down either.

She bailed on coffee but it was partially cause she was late and I couldn’t meet up will later, but she thought it would be ‘too rushed’ cause she had plans to go to the movies with a friend, said she needed a girls’ night. (I think this is good, since it wasn’t a no, it was a I’d be too rushed) I let it go with a funny reply and haven’t followed up. She hasn’t messaged since. It was just last night though.

My gut tells me there’s still mutual attraction. But I don’t want to push for something serious — I’m just looking to revive this as a respectful, no-strings-attached FWB, casual situation.

So I’m walking this tightrope:
	•	Stay cool and confident
	•	Don’t over-invest
	•	But also be honest and make the offer when the moment’s right

Any advice on how to read this and reframe it toward casual again — without being “that guy” or killing the vibe? Timing? Phrasing? A call vs text? I think I should do it in person?

1kto5g9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kto5g9,🦷 I Built a Smart Bruxism Tracker that Stops Your Night Clenching - Powered by Arduino + ML + Android,"Hi everyone!

After months of development, I'm proud to share my fully **customizable** and **open-source Bruxism Detector** – a smart device that doesn't just detect jaw clenching, but helps you find and eliminate the triggers behind it.

✨ **What it does:**

* **Detects bruxism events in real time** using EMG and **machine learning** (SVM)
* **Interrupts clenching** with customizable feedback (like beeps or alarms)
* **Logs events** directly to your phone or PC, creating a **sleep diary**

💤 **More than just a detector:**

* **Trains your jaw to relax** during the day **and tries to condition it while you sleep**. *If this fails, then it tries to wake you up.*
* **Tag your day** with lifestyle factors (stress, coffee, workouts, meds...) and it links them with your clenching data
* Integrates **smartband** or **smartwatch sleep metrics**
* **Visualizes your nights with rich graphs** – have breathing issues, clenching, sleep interruptions and more at a glance  ^(note: while some problems might be obvious, always consult a doctor if you're serious about your sleep health)

📊 **And it goes a step further:**

* Tracks your **progress since day one** and presents everything **in charts**
* **Automatically rates each tag** as **good, neutral, or bad for your bruxism**, based on correlations found in your history

Answers to e.g.:

>“Did coffee cause more clenching?”  
""Does this medication reduce activity for me?""  
""Does clean eating help me get back on track?""

🛠️ **Totally DIY-friendly:**

* **Fully customizable down to the last bit**
* Includes a **3D-printable modular enclosure**, with optional add-ons like a **wall mount**, a **battery module** and **phone holder for self-recording**
* Includes a **comprehensive guide**
* **Anyone of any skill level** can make one – whether you're a beginner or a hacker
* **Low-cost build**: as of 2025, you can assemble one for around 100 EUR or less

🎁 All hardware, Arduino code, Android app, and everything in between is **100% open source**.

“Tikman mo, babe. Mas pina-steep ko ngayon.”  
*Steep?* Hindi nga ako sure kung kape pa ‘to o potion sa Hogwarts.

And yet… I drink it. Every time.

Not because I like it (I don’t), but because I love him. And because habang iniinom ko yung lasang heartbreak na kape, he sits beside me, quiet, calm, and content.  
Sabay kami hihigop, sabay din kami mapapapikit sa tapang.

One time I asked, “Bakit ba lagi kang nagtitimpla ng kape kahit antok na antok ka na?”  
Sabi niya, “Para may moment tayo bago matulog. Kahit five minutes lang.”

So ayun. Five minutes of bonding. Two cups of questionable coffee. One sleepy love story.

In a world full of 3-in-1s, I found someone who brews chaos—but with love.",151,1748018306.0,OffMyChestPH,23,1.0,False
1kto3rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/evangelion/comments/1kto3rl/my_return_to_eva_after_25_years/,My return to Eva after 25 years,"I'm posting this because I mentioned ""coming back"" to Eva having discovered it originally in 1999 and a few folks said ""I'd like to hear that story"". I don't think it's particularly interesting, but here it is for those who wanted to know. Incidentally, thanks for everyone who has been welcoming to me in this community, where I very much feel like ""the old man"". :)
---
I first discovered Eva via the SBS TV airing here in Australia in 1999 and instantly fell in love with it. I was in college at the time and going through a lot of personal stuff, and Eva resonated a lot with me, especially the character of Shinji (including his relationship with his dad).

Eva was also my ""gateway anime"" (I had grown up with things like Robotech and Star Blazers and understood their origins, but ""real"" anime was limited in accessibility outside of very mainstream releases like Akira on VHS).

My new love of Eva caused me to visit hobby shops to find Eva merch (I laugh now remembering how hard it was to find stuff and being told ""oh, that show finished in 1996 in Japan, so it's pretty much dead for new merch"").

In the process I discovered not just the Eva movies (i.e. EoE) but all the other amazing anime I'd never seen, rented on dodgy fifth generation VHS bootleg fansubs. Here I discovered everything from Cowboy Bebop to Slayers to FLCL to Gundam to Saber Marionette to Excel Saga to Ranma 1/2 to Tenchi Muyo. It was frankly amazing.

But it was still Eva I was massively obsessed with, and I ended up with a huge Eva merch collection. It is amusing to think that at the time, I was hoping to collect ""everything"" (using the book E-Mond as a guide, since this was pre-internet for me); coffee cans, phone cards (one set was freaking gold!), statues, model kits, so many soundtracks.

Eva was also something I closely associated with that time in my life, and with certain family members (I still do). for example, my mum gave me the Eva storyboard books as a graduation present. My grandmother (who I was very close to and who passed away shortly after) bought me many of the Bandai model kits when we would go for lunch near the hobby store.

After college though, various things in my life changed dramatically. In some ways, it was painful to rewatch the show and look at my collection because it reminded me so much of that time in my life. I decided to literally ""lock it away"". I put my collection in a closet, put the VHS and DVDs on the shelf, and hadn't watched it again in decades.

Time passed, and I also drifted away from anime too (perhaps because that too was so much of a part of that time in my life).

However, during the pandemic, lockdown caused me to start watching anime again, discovering new shows (though with more of a leaning towards relaxing and ""cosy"" than when I was young and edgy).

Seeing anime again made me think again about Eva. I actually owned most of the Rebuilds, but had been hesitant to watch them for decades since I had such strong feelings about the original show and the memories it brought.

In 2024, my health took a drastic downturn and I looked at those Rebuild films in a different light: something I had put off that maybe I might never get to see. So in 2025 - 25 years after I first saw Eva and ten years after the show itself was set - I sat down and watched them all.

My feelings on Rebuild are definitely very mixed (I am a bit relieved to see I'm not the only one), and not really something to go into here, but the main thing was that watching those films brought back all the love and obsession I had for the original Eva show - for those beloved characters I had loved *so* much - all over again.

I immediately dove back into the show and have set out to read/play all the books/comics/games that were untranslated or unfinished when I was a fan in the early 2000s. Discovering that the White Paper tabletop RPG and Girlfriend of Steel video game - two things I bought decades ago but could never understand - were finally translated was a dream come true!

So now I am ""back""... and it's fun, but a little overwhelming. I worry about becoming obsessed again (I have already vowed not to buy any new merch unless I *really* like it, since we are now in an era where Eva *everything* exists). Some days I do feel like a recovered alcoholic who has taken their first sip of booze after 25 years and immediately started chugging back bottles!

Also, my initial fandom was pre-internet (and certainly pre-social media); by the time I was online I had moved away from Eva. Thus, I've never been part of any Eva online communities or a wider fandom. I am also possibly older than a lot of folks here and on other fan sites these days, certainly older than those who discovered Eva with the Rebuilds or on Netflix via the new dub, so forgive me if I'm a bit more ""crusty"" and/or ""out of touch"" than you are (I certainly have never delved into ""fan theories"" and ""extra-canon deep lore""; what's in the show is all I know).

Finally, it's funny thinking that I was not too much older than Shinji when I first saw Eva... and now I am close to Gendo's age!

In 1999, I was *desperately* in love with Asuka... now I see her far more as a daughter I'd want to protect.

Also, like I said, I had major father issues back then. My father passed away in 2019, and now I find myself, well, not relating to, but understanding Gendo and the older characters a lot more, even though I still feel like Shinji sometimes.

Anyway, here I am, back in this world again. Watching the show again, seeing these characters in games and manga... it's nice.

I don't know what the future holds for me, or how long I will remain in this world, but while I am here it is comforting and it is nostalgic and it feels like home.",3,1748018234.0,evangelion,0,1.0,False
1kto30t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Turbulent_Piccolo651/comments/1kto30t/what_are_the_most_important_diet_rules_for/,What are the most important diet rules for effective weight loss?,"let’s keep this simple. Losing weight can be challenging but it is not a complex puzzle. There is so much information out there trendy diets quick fixes random advice from people who don’t even stick to themselves. But in the end sticking to the fundamentals is what works. Honestly if someone had just laid this out for me clearly when I began I would have saved a lot of time and stress. 

remember calories - 

Above all consuming more than your body needs means you won’t lose weight. It doesn’t matter how healthy your meals are. You could eat grilled chicken and kale all day but if you're overdoing it the weight won't budge. I know it’s not fun to hear but it’s the truth. 

liquid calories can sneak up on you - 

Soda juice coffee drinks and alcohol add up quickly. The worst part They don't fill you up. It's better to stick with water black coffee or tea most of the time. Save the fun drinks for special occasions not every day. 

Protein is extremely helpful - 

I didn’t understand how crucial this was until I made sure to get enough. When you have enough protein in your meals you tend to feel fuller. This reduces the need to snack and helps maintain muscle as you lose fat. So whether it’s eggs chicken or Greek yogurt find what works for you and make sure to include it. 

Focus on real food as much as possible - 

I’m not saying never eat anything packaged (because life happens) but aim for foods that resemble actual food. You want to avoid items with unrecognizable ingredients. Think fruits vegetables rice eggs and meat simple choices that work. 

Be mindful of portions even with healthy foods - 

I learned this the hard way. I was eating healthy foods but still not losing weight because I was eating too much. Sure almonds are healthy but a handful can quickly turn into half the bag. The same goes for peanut butter and even brown rice just be aware of how much you are consuming. 

You don’t have to be flawless just don’t give up - 

Seriously there will be times when you slip up. You might eat pizza or have days when healthy eating feels out of reach. That’s completely normal just don’t let one bad day turn into a bad week. Get back on track the next day or even at the next meal. That’s what really counts. 

Have some kind of plan - 

You don’t have to prepare twenty meals every Sunday unless that suits you but at a minimum you should know what you’re going to eat that day. If you leave it to chance you're likely to end up ordering food or eating something unplanned. 

Avoid the urge to starve yourself - 

I have been there and know how it feels. It's terrible. You end up fatigued irritable and eventually bingeing. It may work for a short period but it’s not a long term solution. Eat enough to feel good but not more than what you truly need. 

It requires time - 

I understand the desire for quick results but honestly rapid solutions are never lasting. You may shed ten pounds in two weeks only to gain back fifteen later. I’ve done this repeatedly. Slow and steady progress may feel tedious yet it really lasts. You have to think about the long haul here. 

Keeping track of what you eat is helpful even if you don’t want to - 

I didn’t want to do it either but once I began to write down my meals or use an app I realized how much I was consuming. I was eating far more than I believed. You don’t have to keep it up forever but it is very helpful when you are just starting off. 

So that’s the honest advice. No gimmicks or trendy terms just straightforward things I wish someone had told me clearly. Losing weight isn’t about perfection. It’s about making more good choices than bad and not giving up. That’s all there is to it.",1,1748018185.0,u_Turbulent_Piccolo651,0,1.0,False

1kto0yc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1kto0yc/please_help_me_understand_if_my_feelings_are/,Please help me understand if my feelings are valid after sessions that made me feel judged by my therapist?,"Ive been going to therapy for more than a year and I like my therapist she makes me feel safe and helped me a lot. There are sometimes tho where I felt judged by her reactions/words.

I know Im hypersensitive so I take my own feelings with a grain of salt. I tend to tell myself the therapist is a knowledgable person and if it doesnt sit right with me it's probably something I need to work on.

So the first thing was when I told her I put an end to a long distance situationship that was going on for 2 months, someone I really clicked with but I was so deeply wounded by a previous experience with long distance relationship that I chose to end this and go no contact. The person I was in a situationship with is the only person I ever felt so safe with, the only one who actually understood me on a deep level and actually showed me empathy care and affection in a way that I had no doubts this could work. We could talk all day and night and we have a very open dialogue about everything that mattered.

Thos person shared their doubts and told me they hardly saw any future for us but still asked me if I wanted to have a LDR. I just didnt want to have a long distance relationship and this person also had doubts about me moving away from my family or him moving away one day (2 different countries). We were friends like 10 years ago so its someone Ive known for a long time.

The way my therapist reacted was kind of implying that Im pushing away something that was good for me, despite me telling her every reason the person gave me (they had a lot of doubts too and they were afraid their family wouldnt accept me),and my own concerns and fears.

I felt that she judged my concerns when I am sure I made the right choice tbh I couldnt have gone through loving someone from afar for years and them possibly breaking up with me one day because they dont see a future for us, after so much investment.

The 2nd time I felt judged by her was when I said to her how much I was hurt by a friend's behavior. The friend basically asked me if I wanted to go somewhere I said yes but then she changed her plans and we went somewhere else similar, there were a lot of people and I was clearly uncomfortable, I asked my friend multiple times if we could go somewhere else (it was like 15min away in car),but she refused every option I gave. Since I was far from home I couldnt go back by foot so I waited for my friend for the whole 6h we spent there, she had her fun and I was trying to read a book but it wasnt pleasant and neither exactly how I had planned to spend my Sunday. My friend didnt talk to me much and after we got home I felt used like an object. She wanted someone to go with but didnt care about me and spent the time as if she was solo. Some days later I expressed my hurt to her using ""I felt"" and also asked her if she planned to go alone or if she really wanted to spend time with me, and she said she was planning to go alone but thought about asking me. She also dismissed my feelings by saying Im taking things too far. It was hard for me as it was the first friend I felt safe enough to open up with, thinking that they would understand.

My therapist said I was being a bit harsh on my friend for thinking that way.

The 3rd time I felt judged by my therapist was recently, when I expressed to her that an old friend of mine ignored me straight for a year after talking behind my back with friends we have in common, and when i finally saw her one day she blatantly ignored me like looked at me for a long time then turned her head away just when I was about to come say hi and rushed directly into a shop. This actually triggered me as we share a long history of friendship but this person also had previously ghosted me for years during her uni years, and also bullied me when we were 11 yo (I brushed that off as a kid), and also used to dismiss everything/get upset at stuff I said during the last meets up we had with friends. After this incident, I came to know that she saw my sister and asked her to go take a coffee together in some days (she was my friend not my sister's). At this point I felt very insecure and thought she was deliberately messing with me.

So, because I felt afraid and also angry at her behavior, and I didnt want her anyway near me, I sent her a polite text explaining I saw her and it seemed like she wanted to avoid me so Im sorry if I did anything and I wish her the best. For me it was a polite way to tell her I want to put and end to this friendship, and I also wanted to check if she would be honest with me (ghosting me then ignoring me straight, deleting my number also, I must have done something right?). I was ready to forget about everything if she was honest with me, if she said she had anxiety that day and just didnt want to talk I would have understood, this text was my last chance to see if she would ever be honest with me (because of her various behaviors I was not feeling safe around her). But she straight up gaslighted me, said she would never do this, also came up with 4 different excuses (she coudnt deny I saw her because I explained in detail in which shop she went on this day when she first denied) , also said she has bad eyesight (why would she look at me straight then when I come say hello she rush away?).

Basically my therapist said to me that me sending this text was not benevolent as it was like Im telling her ""you are a bad person, I saw how bad you are what you did is wrong"". But it wasnt my intent and I got surprised to see that my therapist thought that of me. She said the friend is actually an avoidant person and that's why she behaved like this, impulsively avoiding without giving any reason, and it might be that this friend was convincing herself that she was not lying. This and everything else my therapist told me I agree with but her comment about me wanting to tell the friend that she is a bad person brushed me wrong way.

I want to remind you all I love my therapist she's great and I respect her opinion, but I need other people's POV.

So I am asking you, am I right to feel judged by these events or am I clearly unhealed and need to work on potential triggers? Thank you.",1,1748018040.0,TalkTherapy,4,1.0,False

1kto0ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sheltie/comments/1kto0ex/shelties_i_have_known/,Shelties I have known,"My wife and I have been fortunate to care for and love three Shelties. All of them had distinct colors and personalities.  


The first was Goldie, a Mahogany Sable we got when she was 8 weeks old. She was born brave and independent. In the car ride home from picking her up, she crawled all over me and the car. A few days after getting her, I stupidly left the front door open. “Hey! Where‘s Goldie?” In a panic, I started searching the neighborhood. About 2 blocks from home, the tiny fluff-muffin prances up to me. “Oh, Hi! I was just checking out the neighborhood.”

[Goldie as a fluff-muffin, about 8 weeks old](https://preview.redd.it/z8gxun4h4k2f1.jpg?width=1474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd40527bf36d83fdd2f91d04f468ab1a73180749)

For some strange reason, when she was about 9 years old, I decided to do a little light agility work with her. She LOVED it! And it seemed to create a tighter bond between the two of us. 

[Goldie doing agility, about age 9](https://preview.redd.it/4i077oty4k2f1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e854814f791026a9f5411f874c8e9f4d9975ba73)

Our second was Doorie, a classic Tri-color lad, who was about 14 weeks old when we got him. Doorie had a bit of a “deprived childhood”, a very small world. The opposite of Goldie, he was afraid of everything. The first time he saw my naked chest without my T-shirt on, Doorie started barking like crazy. “Something’s wrong! You’re not my Dad, who are you!” Doorie would bark at people in “different“ attire,  loud noises like garbage trucks and motorcycles, and even the fire hydrant! “Little dude, that fire hydrant is going to be very important to you in the future.” 

[Doorie](https://preview.redd.it/j1ickcar5k2f1.jpg?width=2623&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc36f79a2bc3485828edc6cd2f4966e13de6fb63)

  
My wife and I did lots of “desensitizing” work with him on his hot buttons. To get him used to loud noises, we took him to a place near us which had outside metal stairs. We stomped around on the stairs making noise and praised and treated him as he got used to the noise. Doorie also was a little anxious around busy city streets with cars and people passing by. So, I took him to a downtown spot near a busy Peet’s coffee shop that had sidewalk outdoor seating. I could just sit there sipping coffee as Doorie gradually acclimated.

I told my wife Goldie had to learn fear and Doorie had to learn how to be brave.

Doorie had passed away from cancer Easter Sunday, April 17 2022, a few months short of age 15. My wife and I were in our 70’s and thinking Doorie was our “last dog”.  But it was not to be! As time wore on we missed having a dog. They “fill up the house”.   
  
I found myself searching for an older dog, ideally between 2 and 8, given we were in our 70’s. There were Shelties out there, but they were several states away. How could we get a dog, sight unseen, and have it transported to us? Didn’t seem wise or practical.

In one of my “Sheltie shopping” exercises on the Web, I found a breeder near Lake Tahoe (we live in the San Francisco East Bay). The breeder had puppies for sale. Um, no. But then I saw an older dog for sale, on the web site, Monique, about 2yo. Huh. Contacted the breeder. ”Yes, she’s still available.” Ok, how do we get Monique to where we live? “Oh, my daughter lives near you in the Bay Area. I’m coming down for a visit this weekend and I’ll bring Monique.” 

Yay!

After the initial shock of being re-homed, Monique has shown herself to be a sweet, smart dog who learns quickly. She’s quite the “house dog”, which works for me. 

Kismet.

1kto090,https://www.reddit.com/r/JacquelineWilson/comments/1kto090/spoilers_thoughts_on_think_again/,SPOILERS - Thoughts on Think Again,"I was SO excited for this book to come out and I did race through the audiobook in a similar way to how I’ve always devoured JW books. I found it so disappointing, even putting to one side the continuity errors that many others have pointed out :( my main issues: 

1. Obvious creepiness aside, how could JW do that to Mr Windsor? Fair enough he was a minor character in the original girls series but he came across as a really decent bloke. It was like he’d had a total personality transplant and morphed him into Russell?! Why not just get Ellie and Russell to briefly reunite if you wanted to do a storyline of a controlling/mansplaining man and Ellie’s realisation she is attracted to Alice. 

2. The ridiculously specific details Mr W and Mrs Henderson both remembered about the three girls were just so unrealistic, given they were meant to have taught them 27 years ago and would have taught literally thousands of children since.

3. The birthday party seemed a forced lazy way to try and reintroduce old characters, it could have been so much more organic e.g. I’d have loved a reintroduction of Russell in a different context like bumping into each other at a gallery or something where we were shown how much Ellie has grown as she used to be besotted as a teen but she now realises how pompous and arrogant he is. There is no way that an ex from over 20 years ago would turn up at your birthday party with their wife. Nor your form teacher from nearly 30 years ago! 

4. Also found Ellie irritating the whole way through. She’s so superior and judgemental especially about the Nadine choking situation where her friend is literally sexually assaulted and all she does is victim blame her and then it’s just never mentioned again, even when they all meet up at the pub Ellie never bothers to check she’s okay?! I also found the repetitive internal monologue she has about whether she’s into Mr W or not so tiresome. And the fact she’s in a good teaching job and making money from the Guardian but she’s so stubborn and selfish she’s taking up a council flat someone else probably really needs because she has too much pride to accept help from her dad. 

5. The anti men rhetoric from Magda and Nadine saying that all men mansplain and are controlling etc. 

6. The whole Alice and Ellie dynamic. All the foreshadowing for them ending up together and yet Ellie apparently doesn’t realise she’s attracted to her until like 5 mins from the end even when she’s literally fantasising about her when she’s having sex. And we’re expected to believe that Alice is “in love” with Ellie after meeting her like 3 times. Alice seemed to barely be in the book and just had no personality at all. Ellie describes her at the end to Mr W as being “really dry and witty” or something and I’m like, is she?! 

7. The excessive number of storylines throughout and underdeveloped characters, it would have been better to pick one or two and have a more satisfying conclusion:

- Lottie and her father being a random one night stand, which I didn’t really think was something Ellie would have done as she was such an anxious overthinking teen, it felt out of character that she’d accidentally get pregnant and want to keep the baby or sleep with a random dude. If JW wanted to make Ellie a young mum, I think it would have made more sense to make Russell or that Mick guy the dad. And Lottie being immediate besties with him and calling him Dad. 

- Ellie’s dad’s depression/cardiac arrest, which is never mentioned again. 

-Magda’s baby/husband/stepchildren

-Nadine’s sex life and assault 

-Nigel as the stalker and the implication he could be an incel and Ellie’s family just laughing it off and it never gets mentioned again. 

-Wendy as a completely one dimensional villain like a caricature, Lottie has no personality either. 

8. The slightly xenophobic depiction of the next door neighbour and the suggestion that an Eastern European migrant would be given a council flat. 

9. How repetitive it was. How many times did Ellie need to make a coffee or have a row with Mr W and then have sex and have something fancy to eat that he made or apologise to Stella after leaving her all night. It didn’t really progress the story at all. Also, is Ellie meant to have an alcohol problem? I don’t think a day went by when she didn’t have a drink. 

10. With the general consensus being that Magda and Nadine were both terrible friends, 
the fact that Ellie hasn’t made ANY other proper friends 27 years later (I know a few are mentioned at the party but we literally never hear about them again, they’re not written as close friends of hers). I would have preferred to have seen maybe a reunion between them after drifting apart and her challenging their shitbag behaviour.

Secret for me, public knowledge for almost everyone else ... Bear with me :

So yesterday, my sister visited me at home as I needed help with some work. As we took a coffee break, my sister becomes slighty serious and says to me "" You know, I'm starting to find it kinda weird that your wife doesn't have any pictures with you on her instagram, am I wrong ? ""

Now to my knowledge until then, my wife's ""only"" Instagram account has like 10ish pics, and a little above 100 followers. I answer that she barely uses the app/site whatever and there is no point in having me plastered around for such a small family&close friends account. lt was that moment when my sister's face went Hollywood-like surprised as she says "" no man, I'm talking about her famous account, I don't see you in literally any pic there "" . My brain cannot comprehend anything as I look at her and just ask about what goddamned account does she talks about and what in the f\*\*k is even this. I don't think any Academy Awards winners could recreate the "" wtf "" look on both me and my sister's faces during this conversation.

She goes to her following list and shows me an account that indeed had my wife's face as a profile picture and a very shortened version of her "" normal "" instagram's user name. An account I've never seen before. She clicks it and that's when my life goes full 2020 : an account of my wife with more than 2.000 posts, and more than 250k followers. My mind can't comprehend what I'm seeing. I immediately acces my account and try to visit her profile from my login. Page not existing - I'm blocked by my own wife... I'm married with this woman for 18 years, we have two daughters... My mind is blank, I can't have any reaction whatsoever. We scroll and scroll, from those posts, about half of them are sexy pics of her either at the beach, pool clubs, or backyard pools at some of her friends that I know and get along very well with personally, you name it. Wearing thongs, G-strings, thong swimsuits, topless covering with her hands, all the stuff you can see on an account like this. She is with our daughters in some of the pictures, the normal pictures and not the ones where she shows her body off, but my soul is sinking in as I realize that even my daughters know about this account and those pictures. Even in her clothed pictures, she is braless most of the time, and is not shy in showing that for the picture.

I admit I am a slightly prude person in public. I don't enjoy being too much half naked at the beach, and standing in the sun. But man, during almost 20 years of relationship, my lack of beach-going passion was summed in probably 15 minutes of discussion in total. It was a non subject. I've never made a big deal, or a deal whatsoever, about her going to the beach if and when she wants to, or showing her body, or anything else, never in my life. That subject doesn't exist. With me, I don't think she ever went braless for example. Always wearing a good bra, a sports bra, you name it. In our rare outhings together at the beach, she was in shorts or normal swimsuits. The only times when she could took these pictures was when I was away from the city // country for work for a few days // weeks, as I don't remember her going to random beaches, pools, her friends etc. only with our daughters or alone when I was at home.

I try to see if I'm really the biggest loser on this planet. I try to verify which of our close friends, my or her co-workers and everyone else in our circles know about this account. In our age group, no one ( well almost no one as we can see... ) acts like an instagram star, so we have small accounts with a bunch of pics and small number of followers // followings so it was easy to search, none of my co-workers or the men in my family have her at follow, but I check some of her co-workers, guys and girls, and those friends from her "" girl group ""or whatever that I don't really hang around much with, and they do have her "" famous "" account at follow, they know about this. We're 100% sure my sister shouldn't have known about this account and shouldn't have followed her either, that, or she knew that my sister follows and just tried everything to be successful at hiding from me and the people close to me basically in plain sight. I scrolled through the last picture, and they go since early 2017, so It's more than 3 years of this lie...

Basically, I can say that I'm not even looking for relationship advices per se, because it will probably take me a very long time to even fully comprehend the situation and try to open the subject, I'm more about looking for support in order to cope with the thought that my wife considers me less important than 250k subscribers and whoever knows how many others saw her like in all these pictures, in real life, without me having a clue. Since yesterday, I'm in a full blown chat conferrence with my sis, parents and all those who didn't knew about this farce thinking about what should I do, while forcing myself in a ridiculous way to act completely oblivious next to my wife and the kids. I need any advice and any comments you guys have, and thank you for reading !

TL;DR : I found that my wife of 18 years has a secret Instagram account where she posts sexy pics and I was blocked on it, despite many of our commnon friends, and even my sister having complete access.

**nhombrenovalido**

>Can’t even begin to imagine what you should do.

>I think I know what I would do. I’d leave, just disappear. Maybe serve papers if that makes it cleaner. Overall though the main part is to leave.

>First of all, the years of being taken for a fool, that’s a hard pill to swallow.

>Second, the people who have otherwise cared so little about your presence in what you thought was a normal life.

>Third, I don’t think I could look at any of those people, your wife and daughters included, without wondering if anything they say isn’t self serving. It’s not that they lied to you exactly. They were just never forthcoming with the truth.

>For me, I think it just would make sense to chalk it up as a loss and move on. While I don’t think she did anything wrong exactly, it just feels gross. The breach of trust would be too great to repair.

**OOP**

>My daughters are slightly below 18, they're not adults. They might have know about the pics but not about the account, they might think I perfectly know the account too, or maybe that the pics were just for their mom, just having fun at the beach and nothing else. I can't go ""slam dunk"" before I understand all of this if you understand me...

>Sounds like she’s been planning her exit strategy for the past 3 years.

>Probably a good idea to gather some information first before confronting, not only to protect yourself from dishonesty but also just to get a better idea of what the hell is going on. Some useful info: How long has she had this account? Was she using this for extra income? Has she used the account to communicate with people as well? You could probably think up a few more, like specific friends or people you know that follow this account as well.

>I also want to say this is a massive breach of trust and a lot of folks will tell you that you should probably just walk. While I won't say they're right because ultimately that's only something you can answer for yourself and your situation but keep in mind, the moment you decide to walk is the moment you no longer have to expend energy unraveling her lies/secret life. It might save you a lot of pain as things of this nature are often far less innocent than they may seem, even if they seem pretty bad from the start.

>With that said, this has mid life crisis written all over it. Prepare yourself for confronting her because you'll learn far more about your wife in that moment than in years of every day mundane life. Is she apologetic? Does she stonewall you? Lie to your face? Does her reasoning line up with what you know? What is she willing to do to repair the trust that she destroyed?

**OOP**

>Her first pic posted was at the start of 2017, about the extra income and the communication I have no idea. She does like the comments on her pics but I've never seen her responding to them, she doesn't have any links in her descriprion so I have no idea about selling pics or anything else. Everything I know is in the post already.

>I'm not even thinking about walking on her, first, for the sake of our daughters, second, because I want to find out every single thing about this account even if it takes months or years or whatever I don't know

[**OOP**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hf8wwk/comment/fvw4fqt/)

>Her body image was always good, there are no problems, she is always feminine, dresses well and has a great sense of fashion, but you know, while keeping it normal, not dressing like a porn star or idk... she is a good looking woman and never told me that she feels like she's not that.

>Our romantic life is good, is natural, sometimes every day in a week, sometimes two-three weeks pause, we both have mentally demanding jobs and sometimes we're just automatically falling asleep.

>I mentioned I never said anything about her going to the beach in whatever swimsuit she wants. She also never said anything about wanting to wear things like that at the beach.

>About the 4 years ago question... I don't know. It was never in the scenario. I like to see her feeling good and looking good but I can't have ready an answer to this scenario.

>From there, I want to have access to her DM's. That's the only thing and I want to do it without her knowing. I can't tell her and give her the time to delete if something way more wrong than just pics happened. Until I don't know what does she do in the messages in that account, I don't have any other plan whatsoever.

>Thank you for the in-depth response !

He turned to the comfort of his faith, a common practice among men and women in prisons. Inmates are given ample time to reflect on matters such as their spirituality and are regularly exposed to chaplains eager to save souls. A social worker gave Gacy a Bible, and a deacon gave him another. Shortly thereafter, Gacy told the Catholic priest that he prayed, said the rosary, and read his Bible every day. He particularly liked the Book of Psalms. In early April, he was rushed, unconscious and under heavy guard, from his cell to nearby Cook County Hospital for emergency treatment. He had vomited and complained of stomach and chest pains, all symptoms of a heart attack, before being transferred to the hospital's intensive care unit shortly before midnight. He was suffering from low blood sugar and had been fasting during Lent. Since February 28, he had abstained from all food and liquids except orange juice, coffee, and water, losing approximately 20 pounds during this period. Medical staff treated him with intravenous glucose, and his doctor explained that the fast may have contributed to some of the symptoms of a heart attack. After extensive testing, there was no conclusive evidence that his illness was related to a heart problem. (Subsequent visits to the hospital in June and July revealed that he suffered from a chronic heart condition, angina.) On the same April night that Gacy fell ill, a severe windstorm swept through the Chicago area, generating wind gusts of up to 60 miles per hour, causing at least two deaths, and causing an estimated $10 million in damage across the state. Three days later, Robert Piest's body was found. Gacy's fast ended, and he was transferred to the psychiatric unit at Cermak Hospital, where he could be closely monitored and better protected. The hospital, jail, and criminal court building were all part of the same bleak complex of adjacent buildings, and it was convenient for Gacy to be shuttled back and forth between his cell and the courtrooms for hearings. Surrounded by armed guards, he was transported through a concrete tunnel to the hearings. It was never necessary to escort him outside.",2,1748017621.0,JohnWayneGacy_,0,1.0,False

Today, while sipping my usual morning coffee, something kinda caught my eye. I've got this small, scruffy potted plant on my windowsill. It's not much to look at, just a bit of green that I barely pay attention to most days. But this morning, a single ray of sun managed to hit it just right, casting these amazing little shadows and highlighting its tiny leaves. It was like Mother Nature's spotlight was on it, and suddenly, I saw it differently.

I guess it got me thinking about life. How often do we let everyday beauty just pass us by? We're all racing through our routines, rarely pausing to appreciate those small, quiet moments. It makes me wonder... what else am I missing around me? All these little miracles unfolding daily that I just don't take the time to see.

Sometimes I feel like I'm on autopilot, just getting through the day. But maybe these small details are the universe's way of reminding me to slow down, take a deep breath, and really look at what's in front of me. Like a wake-up call that there's more life to live than just ticking things off a checklist.

I don't know if this ever happens to you, but if it does, maybe it's a good excuse to stop and admire the view. It could be something as simple as a sunbeam hitting a plant or just the smell of fresh coffee in the morning. Those little details... they might just make the day better, don't ya think?

We’d met while studying abroad, two people clinging to each other in a foreign land, trying to see if what we had was more than just comfort. At the time, it felt promising enough to bring her back with me.

Singapore was unfamiliar but buzzing with opportunity. I landed a job at a small trading firm that worked with Japanese companies, sourcing products, handling logistics, trying to make sense of supply chains in a city I barely knew. I bounced around a few roles after that, nothing flashy, just enough to find my footing. But truth be told, none of that really matters. Because this isn’t a story about my career.

This is a story about my cousin.

We hadn’t spoken in years by then. Life had pulled us in different directions after university, but around Raya Qurban that year, something nudged me to go back home to Malaysia. Maybe it was nostalgia, maybe guilt, maybe just a craving for sambal and familiar roads. Either way, I packed up for the holidays and made the trip.

I went straight to my cousin’s house the morning after I arrived, only to be told by his mother that he had moved to KL and was working at a bank. Bit of a disappointment, honestly, I’d been hoping to reconnect. So I scribbled my Singapore landline number on a scrap of paper and asked her to pass it on when he called.

A few days later, just as I was about to kick off my shoes at home, my girlfriend called out that someone had phoned earlier, my cousin. He was in Singapore on vacation and wanted to meet up. Said he was staying at some budget hotel nearby. I laced my shoes back up without hesitation and made my way there.

At the front desk, I asked for him by name. They hesitated, probably sensing some drama. After a bit of talking, they relented and gave me his room number. I climbed the stairs, heart light with excitement. But just as I was about to knock, I heard a woman moaning from inside.

I froze. Not because I was judging him, I just wasn’t sure what to do. I backed away and asked the front desk to call his room. They agreed, and about 15 minutes later, exactly 15, I was timing, he appeared in the lobby.

We hugged, laughed, and went for dinner. I asked him about the woman. He denied it at first, but I laid out everything I’d heard, and he eventually confessed. He had met her weeks before coming to Singapore, brought her along hoping for a little romance. Now that he’d gotten what he wanted, he was thinking of heading back early.

I told him off. Not out of moral superiority, but because I cared. I thought he had changed, that maybe he was just using people now. I challenged him, if he wanted my new number, he had to show me a photo of himself on a proper date with her. He surprised me instead, invited me along.

What followed were the strangest three days of my life. I missed work, tagged along with them like a third wheel, watching as my cousin awkwardly tried to be charming, human, present. Something shifted in him during that time. Or maybe I was the one starting to understand.

We didn’t see each other for a few months after that. Then one day, I met up with him again in KL. We sipped coffee at a little cafe, and he dropped the news: he was getting married. I cut him off mid-sentence, “Is this another one of those things?” I asked.

He shook his head. “No. This one’s different.”

She was twenty-three, a final-year student. He was twenty-seven, working a solid banking job, and apparently ready to settle down. He asked if I thought he was rushing it. I told him I couldn’t say, I wasn’t married myself.

The wedding came a few months later. I took unpaid leave to attend. It was a small but joyful ceremony, the kind you don’t forget because of how happy everyone genuinely seemed. My cousin even paid for her tuition. They were young, ambitious, and in love. A little clumsy, sure, but full of hope.

2 years and some time passed, and I barely saw him. Life just got in the way. I was inching into my thirties, or as we called it, “the 3 series,” and I was doing pretty well for myself. I had broken up with the girl I brought to Singapore, can’t remember exactly why, but we drifted. Maybe we were never really anchored to begin with.

Then my cousin and his wife came to visit me in Singapore. We laughed, reminisced, and caught up. But halfway through a story, his wife interrupted him and asked me something so unexpected I didn’t know whether to laugh or walk out.

“Would you be willing to get a girl pregnant so we can buy the baby?”

I stared at her. She said it like she was asking for a ride to the airport. Turns out she couldn’t have children. Something to do with an infection in her womb. They were desperate. And instead of adopting, they wanted my baby. Mine.

I told them they were mad. “Gila apa, nak beli baby macam beli mainan?”

Then I listened.

She had escaped a dark life before meeting my cousin. “Bad connections,” she called it. As I made us coffee, something in her story clicked. Disease. Escape. Desperation. I pulled my cousin out to the balcony and asked straight up, did he know?

He collapsed, tears and all, and said yes. She had been a prostitute. She was one of those high end protitutes that were expensive but were still connected to a ring, that’s actually why she was able to live such a high functioning life and got her diploma, eventhough she was a prostitute. He had fallen in love with her anyway. Fought for her. Paid the gangsters to let her go. But they didn’t stop. They kept harassing them. Once, they broke into their home and raped her, right in front of him.

I was stunned. Furious. Guilty, too, because I had once accused him of changing, and in truth, he had. Just not in the way I thought. He’d changed because he’d endured something I couldn’t even imagine.

By then, I was managing a small team in an IT startup. Decent pay, flexible hours, and I wasn’t spending much after the breakup. So I helped them. Gave him about RM150,000, everything I could spare. Not because he asked. Because it was the right thing to do.

But I said no to the baby.

Fast forward a few years, we’re both 34. I’m married now, expecting my first child. And I’m at a funeral.

My cousin is burying his wife.

They’d moved to Australia. Life had started looking up. But something in her didn’t make it through. Maybe it was the trauma, maybe something else. All I know is that when I saw him standing by the grave, he looked empty.

I tried to console him. Nothing worked.

He had truly, deeply loved her. That kind of love takes guts. And when it’s lost, it breaks you.

A few days later, I flew back to Singapore.

It would be small panel van (think Citroën Berlingo or Toyota Proace City). My first thoughts are something related to Cricket. So I have the following contenders:

\* Hopper, from grashopper, a poem from Keats

\* Vanthony, a play on van and ant, from the fable of the cricket and the ant (since the van is bigger and can carry bigger loads)

\* Spud or Tater, from potato bugs aka Jerusalem crickets since they're the largest crickets in the world and the van would basically be the big brother of my smaller Cricket.

Every week I see distraught humans posting their sadness & regrets on r/puppyblues subreddit. Thoughts of rehoming or asking a breeder to take back their puppy are frequent posts. One person described puppy blues as a *slow burn* that continues with no end in sight. Social engagements are declined & sadly missed because their puppy requires constant round-the-clock care for the first few months of life  (in most cases). Here are some helpful suggestions to help ease the emotional pain you may be currently feeling. Sleep deprivation is also something that single pet owners feel in the earlier months. I’m now recovering from it.

1. Get your pup fully vaccinated as soon as possible so he/she can attend doggie daycare. And overnight kenneling when you need a physical and emotional break.

2. Ask friends and family members ahead of time (before adoption) if their pups & dogs are healthy and up-to-date on vaccinations. Ask them for playdates with their dog(s) and your pup. It’s fascinating to watch adult dogs teach puppies manners, toy sharing, ball chasing and sometimes funny antics like digging holes; which can be a negative doggie lesson. 🤣

3. Purchase dog puzzles that engage your pup’s nose & brain. Share the puzzle with vaccinated fur babies and make it a fun play date. Your friends & relatives will enjoy seeing their adult dogs solve a new puzzle. Tilly outdid her furry cousins because I frequently use dog puzzles placed in her playpen (only during separation times) when I’m away from home. Puzzles contain her favorite treats and a special activity she looks forward to mastering…in minutes.

4. Use a shoulder sling or doggie backpack to take your puppy to dog friendly stores like Walmart, Home Depot & Lowe’s. Call area coffee shops, outdoor restaurants and microbreweries to confirm these establishments are *dog friendly* as advertised on the Internet. Yelp reviews not always current and caused me a wasted trip.

5. Try using rechargeable dog toys to entertain your pup! Tilly loves her rolling ball with neon flashing lights, vibrations, & sounds! Her spinning rope toy and ball automatically go into Hibernation mode after minutes of non-engagement. And they randomly become active again to get the pup/dogs attention. One owner stated a USB powered toy kept his pup (lab) entertained for hours. It helps when you don’t have other animals in your home. And pup/dog relies 💯percent on his/her toys and human entertainment.

1ktnpzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/DACXI/comments/1ktnpzm/once_a_fintech_star_uk_equity_crowdfunding_is_in/,"Once a Fintech Star, UK Equity Crowdfunding Is in Limbo","[Source: ainvest](https://preview.redd.it/fzdza9ns4k2f1.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c2662ad39b112d88841f89ecb48f628ec1c1621)

The UK’s equity crowdfunding sector, once a beacon of fintech innovation, now finds itself at a crossroads. Once celebrated for democratizing startup investment and fueling high-growth ventures, the market has faced a sharp downturn in recent years. Regulatory overhauls, shifting investor behavior, and macroeconomic headwinds have left its future uncertain. Is this a temporary setback — or a sign of deeper structural issues?

# The Regulatory Tightrope

The FCA’s 2025 reforms aim to rebuild trust in a sector plagued by skepticism. Enhanced disclosure requirements, standardized due diligence, and stricter risk acknowledgments for investors are now mandatory. While these changes protect retail investors, they also add compliance costs for startups — a burden that could deter smaller, earlier-stage companies.

One notable shift: non-accredited investors may soon gain access to larger deals. The proposed increase in investment limits could open doors for midsize firms seeking capital without ceding control to institutional backers. However, this comes with a catch: deals over £5 million still require full prospectus compliance, a hurdle that could limit liquidity for all but the most scalable businesses.

The data paints a stark picture. After peaking at £773 million in 2021, investments plummeted to £324 million in 2024 — a 58% drop. Deal volumes fell even further, hitting 297 in 2024 — the lowest since 2014.

# The Shift to Stability Over Risk

Investors are no longer chasing moonshots. The sector’s focus has shifted from early-stage startups to later-stage companies with proven models. Seed-stage deals now account for just 29% of funding, down from 46% a decade ago. Venture-stage firms, by contrast, now command 56% of capital — a trend driven by investors seeking safer bets in uncertain markets.

The top performers reflect this pragmatism. Fintech firm Plum raised £12.7 million to expand its AI-driven savings app, while Sunswap secured £17.3 million for zero-emission refrigeration systems — a clean energy play with clear regulatory tailwinds. Even consumer brands like WatchHouse (£5.82 million for artisan coffee) and Urban Jungle (£11.2 million for urban insurance) thrived by emphasizing brand loyalty over speculative growth.

# Institutional Influx and Blockchain’s Double-Edged Sword

Venture capital and hedge funds are increasingly co-investing alongside retail backers — a move that injects credibility but also intensifies competition. Platforms are also experimenting with blockchain to address liquidity concerns. Tokenized shares and peer-to-peer secondary markets now allow investors to trade holdings, a critical step toward long-term viability. Yet, these innovations remain underutilized, with most investments still locked in for years.

# The Lingering Challenges

* **Regulatory Fragmentation**: Divergent rules across regions complicate cross-border deals, deterring global players.
* **Market Volatility**: With 25% of investors citing economic instability as a concern, confidence remains fragile.
* **Exit Uncertainty**: While a handful of companies (e.g., Plum) are eyeing IPOs or acquisitions, most investors face a multiyear wait for returns.

# Opportunities in the Margins

The Asia-Pacific region offers a glimmer of hope. Its crowdfunding market is growing at a 12.3% CAGR, fueled by tech-driven platforms and government support. Meanwhile, UK platforms like Beauhurst are leveraging AI to match investors with startups — a move that could democratize access to high-potential ventures.

# Conclusion: A Sector in Transition

The UK equity crowdfunding market is not dead — it’s evolving. While funding volumes have cratered, the shift toward midsize firms and institutional collaboration signals a maturing ecosystem. Regulatory reforms and blockchain solutions are addressing longstanding pain points, but success hinges on balancing innovation with investor protection.

The numbers tell the story: sectors like fintech and clean energy are still attracting top-tier deals, and platforms are adapting to meet investor demands for transparency and liquidity. Yet, with only 297 deals in 2024, the sector must prove it can scale sustainably. If it can navigate these challenges, the UK could once again lead the way in redefining how startups access capital — and how investors profit from innovation.

The path forward is clear, but the execution remains uncertain. For now, UK equity crowdfunding remains in limbo — a waiting game between revival and retrenchment.

1ktnpn1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSew8yGDzCY&t=15s,Why Claude 4 Makes Every Other AI Look Like a Joke (Shocking Results),"I just witnessed something that made me question everything I thought I knew about AI development.

Watch the video tutorial below.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSew8yGDzCY&t=15s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSew8yGDzCY&t=15s)

Yesterday, Anthropic released Claude 4 without any fanfare.

No massive marketing campaign. No celebrity endorsements. No flashy presentations.

They just quietly unleashed the most powerful coding AI ever created.

And the results are absolutely mind-blowing.

In the past 24 hours, I've pushed Claude 4 harder than any AI tool I've ever tested.

What happened next will change how you think about building software forever.

# 🚀 The Claude 4 Moment That Broke My Brain

I decided to test Claude 4 with something challenging. Build a complete 3D car simulator.

Most AIs would struggle with this. Complex physics. 3D graphics. User controls. Vehicle dynamics.

I typed one simple prompt: ""Create a 3D car simulator.""

45 seconds later, I had a fully functional 3D driving game.

Realistic physics that felt like a console game. Smooth graphics that looked professionally designed. Intuitive controls that responded perfectly.

This wasn't just code. This was magic.

But then I realized something even crazier...

# 🎯 Claude 4 Doesn't Just Code - It Thinks

Other AIs write code line by line. Claude 4 thinks like a master architect.

It plans the entire structure before writing a single line. Designs the user experience. Implements industry best practices. Handles edge cases automatically.

Here's proof:

# Test 1: The Chess Challenge

**My Prompt**: ""Build a chess game"" **Claude 4's Result**:

* Complete rule implementation (all pieces, all moves)
* AI opponent with strategic thinking
* Clean, modern interface
* Move validation and game state tracking
* Checkmate detection and scoring

Time taken: 35 seconds.

Then I connected browser control and watched Claude 4 play chess against itself. It made logical moves. Developed strategies. Played like it understood the game at a deep level.

# Test 2: The Endless Runner Test

**My Prompt**: ""Make a captivating endless runner game"" **Claude 4's Result**:

* Smooth animations that rival mobile games
* Progressive difficulty that keeps players engaged
* Professional graphics and sound effects
* Score tracking and high score system
* Perfect collision detection

Time taken: 30 seconds.

This would take indie developers weeks to build. Claude 4 did it in half a minute.

# Test 3: The Retro Shooter Challenge

**My Prompt**: ""Create a retro shooter game"" **Claude 4's Result**:

* Multiple enemy types with different behaviors
* Power-up system with various upgrades
* Level progression with increasing difficulty
* Particle effects and smooth animations
* Complete scoring and lives system

Time taken: 50 seconds.

Each project was perfect on the first attempt. No debugging. No fixes. No iterations.

Just flawless execution every single time.

# 💻 The Claude 4 Browser Revolution That Changes Everything

Here's where Claude 4 becomes truly terrifying for the competition.

It can control your entire computer. Browse websites. Click buttons. Fill forms. Complete complex workflows.

# 💡 The Claude 4 Opportunity That 99% Will Miss

Claude 4 represents the biggest opportunity in technology since the internet went mainstream.

But here's the problem: most people will ignore it.

By then, it will be too late.

Don't be one of the people who waits.

Traveling as an introvert can be a delightfully enriching experience when approached with a mindful strategy. Here are some elegant travel tips designed specifically for introverts to ensure their journeys are both enjoyable and rejuvenating.

First, choose destinations that resonate with your personality. Opt for serene locations such as quaint villages, lush nature retreats, or enlightening cultural sites that allow for reflection and solitude. Researching less touristy spots can lead you to experiences that refresh your spirit without the chaos of large crowds.

Plan your itinerary with flexibility in mind. Prioritize activities that allow for personal enjoyment and downtime. For instance, visit museums during off-peak hours or enjoy quiet walks in botanical gardens. Allow yourself the grace to take breaks in cozy cafes or parks where you can recharge away from bustling tourist areas.

When it comes to accommodations, select boutique hotels or charming bed-and-breakfasts over large resorts. These intimate settings often provide a calm atmosphere, allowing for peaceful evenings to unwind after a day of exploration.

Embrace the quiet moments. Bring a book, journal, or sketchpad to enjoy during waiting periods or while sipping coffee. These activities not only help pass the time but also foster a deeper connection to your surroundings.

Lastly, consider traveling with a small group of close friends or family who understand your need for personal space. Sharing experiences with familiar faces can enhance the joy of travel without overwhelming your social capacities.

By following these elegant travel tips, introverts can enjoy the world on their terms, creating meaningful memories while honoring their unique preferences and needs.

1.	⁠Moving out of your parent’s house when you don’t have to. I’ve seen this SO many times.. the young guy/girl wants to have their first chance of freedom and immediately moves out when it would be far better to just suck it up, live with your “annoying” parents for a few more years and save up some cash. If you feel guilty, offer to pay some bills.

2.	⁠Choosing a significant other who does not have a goal-oriented mindset. This is another thing I see too often, and of course love isn’t all about the financials, but it certainly is a factor in many young people complaining about not having enough money. If you date someone who constantly wants to spend money on things and doesn’t want to bring value in terms of income and growth, you’re asking for problems.

3.	⁠Spending money on credit when they DONT HAVE TO! This is a big one, I’ve seen FAR too many people buy a new vehicle and go into 20k-40k in vehicle debt. They get a long term payment plan on an interest accruing, depreciating asset.. you don’t need a new vehicle for reliability, you just don’t know how to search for good used cars and aren’t willing to pick up a wrench and use YouTube for basic maintenance/issues which aren’t difficult to fix. Credit Cards are also a big one too.. if you don’t have to use them, don’t use them.. if you can pay off the statement balance, pay it off 100% of the time and build credit..

4.	⁠Not using the internet for learning. This should be a no-brainer, but if your parents didn’t properly teach you, there are hundreds of good videos on how to budget, invest in your future, and other basic financial knowledge you should know. My parents didn’t teach me a lot of things for this, I used google, and YouTube to learn invaluable knowledge to go forward in my life.

5.	⁠Going to college for degrees being phased out, degrees which have little value, or simply not weighing the option of blue collar jobs. We’ve all seen the unholy “useless degrees”, and to some extent, yeah, they’re right.. but you picked what you’re going to school for, you should have researched more about it before choosing it, and if you’re unsure, don’t go to college yet, work for a few years and save up money while you think. Blue Collar jobs are becoming more in demand as older folks get phased out, many of these jobs offer long hours and overtime which can help you save MORE money.

6.	⁠Not cooking your own food. It’s simple, stop eating out every week, buying fast food, buying that Starbucks coffee every other day. I work 7 days a week and I’m still able to cook, just focus on meal prepping and cooking things that don’t require a long time to cook 15-30 minutes max. This will save you a lot in the long run. Don’t know how to cook? Use the internet, that’s how I learned. It’s literally just following instructions.

7.	⁠Not trying to think of potential side hustles. It’s alright if you don’t, but if you’re able to see a potential market, and you can do it, don’t ignore it, try it out when you save up enough money. Every failure helps you gain knowledge which can help in the future.

8.	⁠Not sharing your apartment with a roommate to split rent. If you’re single, and have an apartment which can house more than one person, consider having a roommate split rent with you. It’s beneficial for both of you and helps you save a significant amount of money. If you’re not single, make your damn partner help you out with bills if they can. This isn’t the 1950’s anymore.

9.	⁠Doomer Mindset.. this one is real, I’ve even been subject to it, but just because something is declining or bad doesn’t mean it’s hopeless. I’ve literally met so many people that are like “Everything’s hopeless anyway, I won’t be able to save money for my future..” WELL YEAH, with that mindset you definitely won’t. People just aren’t willing to take the steps that are necessary to change their situations. It may be hard, and this isn’t applicable to every single situation, but it isn’t uncommon at all.

10.	⁠Being strapped down to a specific place. So many people feel that they have to live in a specific area for X reason, and while X reason is true, they can also live somewhere else and deal with the issues that come with it temporarily to better their future.

These are just a few, I can keep going.. but, these are just a few examples that I think contributes to this GEN Z mindset where they think it’s impossible to succeed or save money.. and, of course not every single point applies to every single person, but I definitely have met a lot of people it does.",0,1748017063.0,rant,0,0.5,False
1ktnmfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/doggrooming/comments/1ktnmfr/i_chose_not_to_take_it_personally/,I chose not to take it personally,"So I ran into a former client today who had two shitzus and 0 idea what she wanted every time she came in. I was not their original groomer at the shop, the one they had left right as I started working and so they switched over to me. 

I groomed them about 5 or 6 times and mom never made any mention if she was unhappy or gave me any notes. Then around Feb. I stopped seeing them altogether. 

Fast forward to this morning and I run into her at the coffee shop. She immediately starts apologizing to me for not coming in and telling me that the last time she came in the dog got clipped too short so she decided to seek out another groomer. 

I think she was expecting me to be mad or upset but I just smiled and told her that I didn’t take it personally. I let her know that it was important to me as a dog groomer for her to get exactly what she wants out of the groom and if I can’t deliver them going elsewhere is never a bad call. She seemed really relieved that I wasn’t mad. 

Honestly, I’d usually take stuff like this personally, how can you not? It’s our artwork but right now I am booked through July almost August, I have a wonderful clientele and really, this lady wasn’t my client to lose in the first place. It was my former coworker. 

At the end of the day, we can’t take this kind of thing personally. People have their reasons for  what they do and it’s almost never against us as people.

And I’d like to say this to owners: we as dog groomers CANNOT read your mind. No matter how hard we might try. If you want something changed, tell me. If you want a certain style, tell me. If you are unhappy with the groom, I am more than happy to discuss what you want differently. Some of my favorite clients have become the ones that no one else in my shop will take because they’re “too picky”. I LOVE those clients. They know what they want and they have no problem telling me what it is.

Any way just wanted to share because choosing not to take something like this personally is something I’ve really struggled with and I know a lot of us struggle with it too. ",17,1748017036.0,doggrooming,0,0.96,False

one of the things i really love about him is how thoughtful he is. like he always thinks of me. especially when it comes to food he never forgets to bring me something when he remembers me. just recently, he bought me coffee. A MATCHA COFFEE MY FAVVV!! i swear it was exactly what i needed. he didn’t even know i was having a rough day, pero that one cup of coffee made everything feel a bit better. it might look like a small thing to others, but for me it means a lottttt. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH DAD.

1ktnln8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ktnln8/my_parents_still_treat_me_like_im_financially/,My parents still treat me like I'm financially irresponsible even though I make more than they ever did,"I'm 27, have a good job, live in my own place, pay all my bills on time and have been steadily building up my savings for years. By any reasonable measure, I'm doing pretty well for someone my age. But my parents still act like I'm the opposite of that which makes me feel very sad especially because they're literally my parents.  
The breaking point happened last weekend. I went to Vegas with some friends and as everyone who goes to Vegas, I spent some money at the tables. Had a really great night actually like I came back with more than I went in with and enough extra to finally book a Europe trip I've been planning. Also, the food in Beer Park was fucking amazing.  
When I mentioned it to my mom, she immediately went into lecture mode about how I'm ""throwing money away"" and ""what if you had lost everything"" and all this other stuff. Like I kinda understand, but I'm literally an adult. The money I brought was literally budgeted for entertainment. I spend less on a weekend trip than some people spend on their daily coffee habit.  
What really gets me is that they'll praise my cousin who lives paycheck to paycheck but ""works so hard"" while treating me like I'm reckless because I can actually afford to enjoy my life sometimes. It's like they can't accept that I've grown up and learned how to manage money responsibly.

I love my parents but I'm so tired of defending every purchase I make to people who think spending money on anything fun is automatically irresponsible. Any advice on what should I do?",153,1748016981.0,TrueOffMyChest,37,0.99,False
