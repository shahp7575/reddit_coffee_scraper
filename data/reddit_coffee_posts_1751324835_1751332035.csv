 Today we're diving into a super interesting topic in the crypto universe: the difference between Irys' and Walrus' data storage approaches. Grab your coffee  and let's unravel this together!   
  
 **Built-in vs. Built-on: The Foundation of Everything**  
  
  •Irys: Think of Irys as a self-sufficient city. It's a complete datachain, with its own miners, token, and rules. Everything is integrated, from storage to security. It's an ""all-in-one"" solution.  
  
  •Walrus: Walrus, on the other hand, is like a city that relies on others to function. It focuses on storage, but needs ""external systems"" (like Sui) for other tasks. It's a more hybrid solution, with various pieces fitting together.

 **Tokenomics: How Money Flows**  
  
  **•Irys:** Simplicity is key! Irys uses a single token for everything. This makes the developer's life easier and allows storage to be cheaper, as miners earn from other tasks.  
  
  **•Walrus:** Here, things get a bit more complicated. Walrus uses two tokens (WAL and SUI). This means you need both to pay for storage, which can make the process more expensive and complex.  
  
 **Fault Tolerance: The Security of Your Data**  
  
  **•Irys:** Irys bets on redundancy. It creates 10 complete copies of each data segment. It's like having 10 backups in different locations. Simple and effective!  
  
  **•Walrus:** Walrus is more ""mathematical."" It uses a technique that slices data into pieces and spreads them out. Even if some pieces are lost, the original data can be reconstructed. It's a robust solution, but it requires more ""bureaucracy"" to track everything.  
 **Programmable Data: The Future is Now!**  
  
  **•Irys:** Irys makes programming with data native and fluid. Developers can access and use data directly, without complications. It's like having everything at your fingertips.  
  
  •**Walrus:** Walrus also allows data programming, but in a more ""indirect"" way. Developers need to take a few more steps to validate and use the data, which can be a bit more work.  
  
 **Storage Duration: Forever or for a While?**  
  
  **•Irys:** Irys offers truly permanent storage! Thanks to a sustainable funding model, your data can be stored for over 200 years. It's the kind of guarantee the protocol offers.  
  
  **•Walrus:** Walrus works with 14-day ""epochs,"" with a limit of almost two years. For longer storage, the responsibility lies with the developer, who needs to create their own renewal system.

Humiliated but determined, she quietly leaves the Silver Moon Pack, leaving behind a life of obedience and heartbreak. As Eithan arrogantly assumes she’ll return, Kiara disappears without a trace, starting anew in a distant city. But when her high school sweetheart, Beta Lorenzo, unexpectedly reenters her life, old sparks ignite. As Kiara rebuilds her identity, Eithan’s desperation grows. Will she reclaim her power, or will the past pull her back? The stakes rise as secrets unravel, and Kiara must decide: is freedom worth the price?

# Chapter 1 - The Fall of a Loyal Mate

My mate, Alpha Eithan Wells of the Silver Moon Pack, thought I couldn’t live without him. But after I disappeared for a month, he frantically called me.

After ten years as his mate, he claimed I was past my prime and turned his attention to a younger, more glamorous she-wolf. His packmates placed bets on how long I’d last this time. But I didn’t shed a tear or cause a scene; I simply packed my things and left. Alpha Eithan sneered, “She’ll come crawling back to me within two days.” A month later, I was still nowhere to be found. He finally panicked and desperately dialed my number. My high school sweetheart, Beta Lorenzo of the P-town Pack, answered with a chuckle, “Ex-mate, have you lost your mind?”

==============================

In the tenth year with Alpha Eithan, I always believed I was special. On our anniversary, I gathered the courage to bring up our mate bond again. Hoping to surprise him, I came home a few minutes early. Unfortunately, I overheard his conversation with his packmates outside the study.

“You mean Kiara? She’s already over the hill,” one of them laughed.

“Good, I thought you’d changed your taste,” another chimed in.

Alpha Eithan replied casually, “Ten years, she’s past her prime. I only kept her around because she’s obedient. Otherwise, I would’ve kicked her out long ago.”

The room erupted in laughter.

“Ten years, Alpha Eithan, Kiara gave you the best years of her life.”

“But honestly, Kiara’s still stunning. You used to cherish her. How can you let her go?”

Alpha Eithan said indifferently, “So what? I’m bored with her.”

That night, I stormed out of the packhouse, making up some excuse about being swamped with pack duties. Alpha Eithan’s tone was cold, completely indifferent to me. But the thought of severing our mate bond grew stronger in my mind.

Not long after, Alpha Eithan’s scandalous affairs were the talk of the pack again. He was pursuing a college junior, an aspiring actress who had just won Best Supporting Actress.

He always went all out when chasing females. Lavish displays, trending on social media, piling up cars, houses, and jewelry like mountains to win her over.

The girl, naive as a blank canvas, had never seen anything like it. Within days, they were together.

Meanwhile, I was genuinely busy with a project for the pack. This project would determine whether I could become the pack’s Gamma.

A friend organized a gathering, inviting a circle of close packmates. Having been with Alpha Eithan for so long, I didn’t want to embarrass him.

But I didn’t expect Alpha Eithan to show up with her. The moment they walked in, the room fell silent.

# Chapter 2 - The End of a Spark

Several of my close packmates looked at me with concern.

I shrugged, “Why are you all staring at me? I’m not the center of attention today.”

Alpha Eithan had his arm around a young she-wolf and, as if on purpose, sat down next to me. He took a sip of his coffee and said with a smirk, “Kiara Meyer, let’s clear the air today.”

“Go ahead,” I replied, my voice steady despite the storm brewing inside me.

“We’ve been mated for so many years, and honestly, the spark’s gone. Let’s just call it quits.”

I clenched my fists so tightly that my nails dug into my palms. But I didn’t feel any pain. It was as if my consciousness had floated away, watching this charade unfold from above.

Alpha Eithan opened his mouth, seemingly ready to continue. I raised my hand to stop him.

“Fine.”

He stroked the she-wolf’s hair, seemingly impressed by my decisiveness, and said in a patronizing tone, “After today, we can still be friends. If you ever need anything, just let me know. There’s nothing I can’t handle around here.”

I shook my head. “Let’s not.”

“Since we’re nothing to each other now, it’s better not to stay in touch. I wouldn’t want her to get the wrong idea.”

Alpha Eithan raised an eyebrow in surprise, then nodded. “Sure.”

I let out a light laugh and stood up. “Well, you two enjoy yourselves. I’ll be going now.”

“Let the driver take you home.”

“No need. I’ll grab a cab.”

As I walked out of the room and closed the door behind me, I overheard the whispers inside.

“How long do you think Kiara will last this time?”

“Two days? Definitely not more than 72 hours.”

“But I feel like her reaction was completely different this time.”

Alpha Eithan glanced at the slightly ajar door and sneered, “I bet she’ll come crawling back to me by the day after tomorrow.”

“This act has been going on for years. I’m tired of watching it, even if she isn’t.”

I didn’t stay to hear the rest. Gripping my phone tightly, I hurried out.

I returned to the apartment I used to live in. Looking at the familiar layout, I couldn’t help but laugh mockingly.

# Chapter 3 - A New Beginning in P-town

The joy I felt when I first moved into the Silver Moon Pack’s territory was now matched by the humiliation of leaving it behind. I didn’t take much with me—just my personal belongings. Everything else, including the memories of my life with Alpha Eithan, stayed behind. I gently placed the mate rejection papers on the coffee table, the words “I, Eithan Wells, Alpha of the Silver Moon Pack, reject you, Kiara Meyer, as my mate” still burning in my mind.

Before leaving, I took one last look at the apartment. Every brick, every tile, I had chosen myself during our early days as mates. Now, it felt like a monument to a life I no longer belonged to. I booked the earliest flight to P-town, a distant city where I could start anew. I had once imagined coming here for a honeymoon with Eithan, but now it was a place of escape.

Being in a foreign pack’s territory gave me a sense of freedom I had never experienced before. That evening, I found myself at a small gathering in a bar, surrounded by strangers who didn’t know my past. After a few drinks, the door opened, and a man walked in. The she-wolves around me immediately perked up.

“He’s really hot!” one whispered.

“Go ask for his number!” another urged.

“You go, I’m too shy.”

Returning from the restroom, I spotted him immediately. He was even taller than Alpha Eithan, dressed in a black coat with a casual suit underneath. What caught my attention the most were his impossibly long legs. I squinted, realizing he looked familiar. Then it hit me—he was my high school classmate, Lorenzo.

My smile froze, and I quickly looked away. We had left each other with some unpleasant memories back then. Lorenzo’s gaze swept across the room and landed on me. Feeling uncomfortable, I excused myself and stood to leave. One of the she-wolves grabbed my arm and called out to him.

“Hey, handsome! You seem like a good guy. We’re all a bit tipsy. Could you make sure Kiara gets home safely?”

I looked up at Lorenzo in surprise. After a few seconds, he nodded. “Sure.”

The she-wolf pulled me back down, whispering in my ear. “Kiara, you’ve only been with one wolf. It’s not fair. Your ex is out there playing the field. Why can’t you? Look at him. With all these she-wolves around, he only has eyes for you. It’s obvious he’s interested. Besides, with a wolf like that, you’re not losing out.”

She winked at me, and I shuddered.

\---

Lorenzo drove me back to my hotel. When we arrived, I unbuckled my seatbelt and stepped out of the car. Standing outside, I politely thanked him. He turned to me. “You’re being too formal.”

I turned to head inside but suddenly remembered what the she-wolf had said. Almost instinctively, I looked back. “Want to come up for a drink?”

In P-town, inviting someone up for a drink was a clear signal. Lorenzo looked surprised but nodded. In the elevator, he kissed me. I was already a bit drunk, and his intensity left me breathless.

“Wait… there’s a camera,” I gasped, my cheeks flushed. My legs were weak, and I clung to his waist for support. Lorenzo glanced at the camera, then turned, shielding me as he kissed me again.

When we reached the door, he held me tightly. “Kiara, do you remember who I am?”

I looked up at him, my fingers playing with his belt as I pulled him closer. “What’s wrong, my childhood sweetheart? Are you scared now?”

Lorenzo chuckled, his fingers tracing my side. “Don’t cry later.”

Our first time, Lorenzo didn’t even make it to the bedroom. The rough wall scraped my back, and I bit his shoulder, choking back tears. “You’re a beast!”

His rough hands cushioned my back. Then he bit my collarbone hard. “You’re a temptress.”

# Chapter 4 - The Echoes of Regret and Renewal

Half an hour later, I lay in bed. Tears welled up as I teased him. “Lorenzo, how long has it been since you’ve been with a she-wolf?”He looked at me darkly. “A long time. I’ve been busy with pack duties.”I was surprised........

After working really hard on the wall gallery and shelf decorating, it feels like it was all for not, because all my eye sees walking into the room is that couch. The plan with opting for a smaller couch was to get some kind of accent chair or smaller seating by the windows, so we put one of our old chairs there as a visual stand-in/temporary seating (also brown). The little storage ottoman we had wasn't very functional anymore with this couch, since with the L couch we lost some space to set down drinks, remotes, etc. So we brought up an old coffee table we had, again for kind of a visual/temporary functionality (you guessed it, more brown). I know the coffee table and side chair are temporary fixes, but I think we're stuck with the couch. Any suggestions on replacing those pieces, or honestly any suggestions at all on how to make this less of a clunky, ""almost right"" area.

Woody Harrelson plays it absolutely straight as the once great Roy Munson, wunderkind bowler from small town America, who meets Ernie McCracken (played by Bill Murray who nails it in one of his few villain roles) as a young pro bowler and through a series of mistakes loses his hand. 17 years later, alcoholic and hook handed Munson meets Ishmael, an awe shucks Amish  simpleton, secretly brilliant bowler. They go on the road ala The Hustler and The Color of Money to hustle bowlers until they can make it to a championship.


I used to watch this all the time as a kid. I haven't seen it in 20 years or more. It was one of the first DVDs I ever bought and I had a fun, naughty time with the R rated cut that I was far too young for at the time. The commentary track was one of the first tracks I ever heard and I learned a lot about how comedy films work behind the scenes. The Farrely Bros used to be the absolute kings of comedy from the mid 90s to the early 2000s. Their films had a charming mixture of heartfelt characters and madcap comedy with emphasis on pushing the envelope of taste.

It's not as funny as Dumb and Dumber and not as much of a romantic crowd pleaser as There's Something About Mary but it's a legitimately funny sports movie with a pretty unpredictable story. I think what makes the Bros so different is that they put crazy gags around a genuinely emotional story. They often cast dramatic actors to play it straight.

Oukirii eagerly asks if they could go, and Orlando nods.

You’d head towards the lake.

The two sit down and observe dragonflies flying above the water. “I’ve never seen this many dragonflies by Oakbright’s rivers!” Oukirii comments. “Oh…….”

She suddenly starts to grow sad, Orlando notices a tear on her face “Kirie?” He says with concern.

“I’m fine, Eh–” She breathes to calm down. “I just remembered a day in my village every year called ‘Sol De Vela’… It’s a day where use candles to honor the sun in a group of traditions. This will be the first year I’ll miss it…”

She continues “After that, we do outdoor meditation with our candles. Then comes Flower Sailing, that’s a fun activity we do together with flowers from the forest. That evening, we bless our waters with the sun’s light by dipping our candles into the river.” She sniffles “I bet that all sounds silly, right?”

“Nonsense! Nothing about your belief is silly.” An idea sparks in his head. “Come on, how about we go hunting in the jungle near here? It could be good practice.” Oukirii looks down and says “That’d be nice.”

You’d go to an area in town called “Meadow’s Bush”

Oukirii loads an arrow into her bow. Orlando seems to be looking for something near the bushes. She walks by him and says “This is helping, thanks.” She looks for something to hunt while Orlando goes over to the nearby shrubbery and begins to pick a few flowers.

A larger flower sprouts on the ground ahead as he looks in the bushes, Oukirii notices the flower and goes over to touch it. Causing her to immediately get smacked by a vine and fall backwards.

**“WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM!”**  A plant creature shouts as she leaps out of the dirt. Her voice is soft but angry. Orlando apologizes for disturbing her. 

“You should be sorry! I’ve been keeping humans out of here for years! One little Meadow can only take so much!”

“Wait… You can see–!?” Oukirii gets up.

“See the ghost you’re with!?” Meadow says before chuckling and retreating back into the ground. She pops out next to Orlando and raises herself up to his height. “I suppose I could forgive a face as handsome as this… Why did you come into the forest?”

Orlando steps back and Oukirii tells Meadow they were just trying to hunt. “Just hunting… That’s all?”

Meadow brags about her power. Growing many plants around her as she moves ahead. “Wait!” Oukirii shouts. A vine sprouts from the trees above and grows a few flowers. Orlando slowly grabs them…

Oukirii questions why he’s taking the flowers. Orlando says “I need them for something, I’ll tell you about it later...” She agrees to help him out.

From the dirt, Meadow appears again and asks “What’s taking you two so long!?”

You’d head forward and pick flowers from various spots. (A few times Meadow may pull them away just as you reach them)

They find Meadow ahead, looking bored. She asks if they’re done yet, Orlando says “Yes… These are great.” 

She chuckles. “Now those flowers are very valuable… So valuable I need something in return! HAND OVER ALL YOUR POSSESSIONS!”

Oukirii steps back as Meadow grows herself taller. “You never told us we had to give you anything!”

“HOW RUDE OF YOU! FACE THIS THEN!” She grows a small cactus at Oukirii’s feet. She jumps, Meadow keeps growing cacti while snickering.

Orlando shouts at her “MEADOW STOP!”

Meadow stops growing the cacti. “Alright! I was just having fun…” Oukirii walks back over to her “Whatever we stole, you can have it back!”

“No… I can regrow them whenever I want!” She pouts, “I wasn’t serious about making you pay for it.”

Meadow moves around slightly, “But if you’d be so kind… PUT UP ANOTHER SIGN! I’M TIRED OF YOU CURIOUS HUMANS EXPLORING MY HOME!” Orlando laughs, “I’ll– see what I can do!”

“Bye Bye now!” Meadow waves “I can tell you two have a request to fulfill!” The two of them wave to her as they exit the forest.

Back in town, Orlando makes a quick new sign, just before he and Oukirii head towards the Inn.

Orlando asks Oukirii for a favor. To find him some candles, he makes up an excuse about needing spares. “Find me two that you really like.”

“Two Candles…?” She’s too tired to think.

You’d Entreat a pair of candles from a Townsperson.

Oukirii shows the candles to Orlando after entreating them. “Thank you Kirie. These will work great!” He puts them away. “Now then… How about we get some rest?”

The two walk into the Inn as the sounds of night are heard around them.

——————

**Part 2: Eastport**

Oukirii smells the air “Sea Salt…” Orlando asks if she ate a good breakfast today. She nods, “Um… What were those flowers you found for?”

Orlando takes out the candles she had entreated. “About that… It’s not perfect, but I thought I’d put together a couple of things today so we can have our own ‘Sol De Vela’.”

“What!? So it— It was for me…”

“Breakfast has already passed, but tonight we should look here for some bitter food to eat and honor your–” She immediately hugs Orlando before he finishes his sentence. “Thank you… Thank you!” He sets the candles on the ground and lights them both.

Orlando and Oukirii lift their candles. Oukirii lets him know, “The first thing we usually do after breakfast is meditation.” Orlando thinks about where they should go, deciding somewhere out of the streets would be best.

You’d head to a small corner of the city.

They set their candles in front of them as they begin to meditate. Oukirii helps Orlando by telling him to focus on a connection with the sunlight around him. “By giving your time and devotion to it, the sun is generous with what it gives back.”

“I see… Focus on a connection…”

The two sit in silence with relaxed arms. Their candles continue to shine bright. Oukirii gets up after a while and asks softly “Are you done?” Orlando opens his eyes and nods.

He describes it as a unique experience while Oukirii talks about it helping her put trust in the sun. Just like when she prays to it.

“Orlando…” Oukirii decides to ask, “Why did you do all of this? You don’t believe in the Sacred Sun…”

“You’re right, but this day is important to you. That’s what matters to me.”

Oukirii smiles, Orlando asks her about the next tradition. She answers “Flower Sailing is next. Here, I’ll show you how it works!” She holds her candle out as her eyes grow wide.

“I don’t think we can do this with just two people… It’s a whole village activity. Each person has a different kind of flower and we briefly swap our candles with each other until we have all kinds.”

“Is there anything we can do as a substitute?”

Oukirii says she doesn’t know. Orlando comes up with the idea of putting the flowers around this area of the city for them to collect. “That might work…” Oukirii thinks.

The screen fades to black, afterwards Orlando returns and tells Oukirii he’s placed the flowers around nearby. The two swap candles and start to walk around.

You’d explore Eastport and find the flowers. Plays similar to when they were gathered from Meadow, but they wouldn’t have a glow to them. Making them harder to find…

Orlando and Oukirii return their candles to each other. Admiring the flowers that now surround the base. Oukirii smirks “That was close enough! Fun too!”

“Now that was a lot of fun wasn’t it!”

He’s about to ask what’s next as Oukirii’s stomach grumbles. “I suppose that answers that! We should see about an early dinner…”

You’d head to a restaurant located on a boardwalk.

Oukirii speaks to a cook through a window, she asks about the most bitter item on the menu. They’d list off a few things, Oukirii orders two servings of something she likes. The cook hands her the food a few seconds later. “You must be hungry! Don’t eat too much!”

The two sit at a table nearby and eat their bitter meal. Neither of them would flinch upon eating. Oukirii wonders how Orlando is so calm, he says “I can’t really taste anything.” As a ghost, he only receives the sensation of eating with none of the flavor. But it goes down just fine.

“You don’t know how it tastes? …Imagine the most bitter coffee you’ve ever drank, and triple it!”

“Oh! In that case maybe there’s a good side to all of this.”

Orlando and Oukirii finish scarfing down their food. They look at their candles on the table, “Right… It’s time for the final tradition. We better get there before the sun goes down.”

You’d head south to Eastport’s beach.

The two stand on the sand as they hold their candles, They walk over to the water and kneel down into it. Oukirii puts her candle into the water deep enough to not put out the flame. Orlando would do the same. She begins to recite a prayer. “Sacred Sun, the water that you give us is plentiful and unstained. As we follow your light, may the water stay with your blessing for another year more.”

The breeze fans their flames as they fully submerge them into the water, putting it out. They both stand up and hold their extinguished candles. The day of Sol De Vela coming to an end.

They decide to sit down on the sand and enjoy the evening beach. “Thanks again for doing this…” Oukirii says. Orlando tells her there’s no need for thanks.

Oukirii thinks about the adventure they’re on, Orlando says “It’s not been simple thus far. But it’s relieving to have fun days like this one here and there.”

“Yeah! I really hope things will turn out well in the end.”

“I’m proud of how far you’ve made it. I’m sure it will.”

They both smile, Oukirii remembers something. “There’s actually another special day we have back in Oakbright… It’s called a ‘Luz de Dieciocho Años’. It’s a festival that happens on a sacred sun follower’s eighteenth birthday.” She pauses “It’s tradition to decorate a grab and have a parent walk you through the village.”

“It sounds like it’ll be a wonderful time for you.” Orlando replies.

“Yeah! I just… Thought… I want you to be the one who walks with me.”

“Um— I don’t know if I can promise that. Hey, I’m sure you’ll be just as happy with Dimitrius walking with you.”

“Hehe… Just an idea.” She says. The camera pans up to the evening sky…

So I’ve been married for a while and my husband and have had it rough. we always managed to laugh most days and enjoy simplicity but I was always the one who was never content which affected our relationship. In the beginning of our marriage he would write me cute notes, buy me coffee, occasional flowers and occasional item of clothing like a dress or shoes. He would draw me cute and hinge and he’s really good at drawing and even would ballroom dance with me. 

After a year my family experienced a trauma that forced us to disown my family as they were committed to being evil. 

I was a mess as I felt alone and it was hard for him. I also had to work full time to help him pay bills. We split everything 50/50 even though before we married I made it clear that I expect him to be the main provider. this caused me stress because I already felt worthless because of my family but seeing my husband comfortable with me paying for half of everything and a lot of time paying more made it hard for me to see myself as a wife ( paid off his debt and trip to see his family and paid for their gifts and vacation with my credit card which I regret.). 

Our intimacy was never great but it was consistent and I maintained the house. He helped with the house and he also was very patient while I went through my depression.

Years went by and we found out that we can’t have kids due to his health. this hurt me but I felt life would still be fine and at least we can vacation and acquire assets etc. but every time we got a big sum of money he would squander it by poor investments or mismanagement. 

I started to feel bad because it’s been a few years of no birthday or anniversary cards or words. he would explain how it’s all wrong islamically anyway and that our focus should be on akhira. Anytime I tried to express a desire for any thing material like perfume or shoes he would explain how I’m being conditioned to want those things. I do understand and I started to see how I am being ungrateful. 

He is a kind good man who helps people and gives me grace for not looking my best when I was depressed  and protects me. He reminds me risq is not from him but from Allah so if I want more I should ask Allah. recently we moved to another country and it was really hard because I didn’t want to sell my stuff to go. But we had to be able to afford it and he really thought it was what was best. Well it was a terrible experience the first few months as everything I worried about happened. But Alhamdulilah things are stabilizing. We are still poor and I am thinking to sell the last of my possessions so we can live comfortably until his paycheck comes in. He doesn’t have any possessions except a PlayStation I purchased for him. When I mention selling my wedding gold his family gave me he gets frustrated. 

The real issue is that I started to see that because he is poor and educated and try’s his best that I should be patient and loving instead of resentful so he can feel nice about himself. And maybe if he feels nice about himself he’ll start to be romantic again. he’s not happy with me because our intimacy has reduced but I’ve just been so stressed and I don’t feel loved- no notes no drawings not even a picked flower. But I know this is because I have a bad selfish mindset that needs to change. So my question to ladies is how can I inspire him to romance me again? How do I push the sheitan away when I start to feel sad or resentful that I should have more?

1loo3r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1loo3r4/its_inside_of_me/,It's inside of me,"         No one believes me when I say something is wrong. I'm a hypochondriac it's the fucking worst a small scrape that looks weird I panic. A head ache that lasts a little to long. Hospital visit. It doesn't help that my anxiety makes the feeling of being sick 10 times worse. Most of my family and friends have decided that they would rather just not hear from me then hear my crazy shit. I don't blame them I'm hard to handle.
            Sighing I get up and go water my plants. They seem to be the only ones who don't care about my crazy. As I was watering them I feel a heavy pressure on my chest and I start to cough and cough. The pressure didn't stop my coughing got worse and it cause me throw up in my kitchen sink. I gasps and gripped the counter as I tried to catch my breath. The pressure was gone as quickly as it came. I deep cleaned the sink and the counter then took a hot shower. That was the last normal night I had.
          The next day was a Monday. My favorite day of the week. I woke up stretched looking around my room thinking about what I wanted to that. I had chosen on my normal Monday check list. Wake up, don't make breakfast but get dressed and go get a pastry and coffee, come home and water plants, go to the library and hang out all day, come home and have a movie and pizza night. Excitedly I got up and started getting dressed only having a slight cough from last night.  
          I made my way to the local Cafe to get my order. The moment I walked in the normal smell of fresh bread and coffee smelled more like rotten meat and decay. I gaged and walked outside trying to get away from the smell.  But no matter where I went everything smelled like rot. Like the wet rot of old leaves and vegetables. I heaved and gaged as I clutched a trash can on the sidewalk. The wave of nausea slowly passed as I made my way back inside. Sitting down on the couch I decided that maybe I should just lay down today and have a inside day.
           Still hungry I looked in my kitchen and didn't really like anything that I had. So I laid back down on my couch and watched some TV. My hunger grew more and more in the following 10 minutes. Soon I felt like a hungry deranged animal. Something primal deep down inside of me wanted to feed. I quickly got up and went to the kitchen to try and find something to eat again. Once again nothing looked good enough for me to eat. But then oh but then I smelled something. It smelled of fresh baked goods, a warm smell, something comforting. It smelled delicious. Without thinking or wondering I followed the smell and just dug in eatting and chewing as much and as fast as I could. When my hunger stopped I realized in horror that what I was eatting was not a delicious baked good but one of my potted plants that was on my nightstand. 
           Screaming I quickly backed up and ran to the bathroom and made myself vomit. Something didn't feel or look right when I did. No dirt or plant came up just stomach acid. That pressure from last night came back as I was throwing up.
            Now crying and panicking I quickly made my way to the hospital that was a block away gaging and throwing up along the way. Cars and city life just going by me no one noticing anything. I finally made it inside the emergency room crying and gaging saliva dripping out of the sides of my mouth like a rabid dog. 
              I made it four steps inside of the emergency room before I got light headed and passed out. Waking up I was in a room. Only hearing the beeps and people sounds outside of my room. Confused I pressed the call button for a nurse. A nice looking women walked in and smiled down at me.
               ""Its nice to see you awake dear. You have been asleep for two day today is now Thursday. Your name is Elizabeth Hoffer."" She paused and looked over at me and my clear confusion ""Your okay hun. You had a nasty fever and came in here crying, you had food poisoning."" I nodded and continued to listen to her as she told me what was gonna happen and what meds I was gonna be on. 
     I was in the hospital for a total of five days three of which I don't remember. They had me on some meds  and sent me home. That walk home felt like a hike. A normal 10 minute walk to the hospital felt more like an hour. By the time i walked in the door I felt exhausted. I laid back down and just napped.
     Waking up a few hours later I was hot. Not just a normal hot my body felt like it was on fire. I got my shower going on the coldest temperature. Not even getting undressed I just laid in the cold shower on the bottom of my tub crying. My body hot my head spinning. What felt like an eternity my body cooled off and as I started to get my legs buckled under me. I yelped and dropped back onto my hands and knees. Crying I try again and failed. The water still raining down on me. Going from one extream to another I now feel like I'm freezing the water hitting my back feeling like sharp daggers piercing into my skin. Crying harder I try to get up again. This time I was desperate. Grabbing onto the shower curtain for support and screaming as the sharp stabs of the freezing water slammed into my body. I thought it would work until I felt the the curtain give way. The pole attached to the wall and came down onto my stomach. Gasping and rolling back onto my side I coughed trying to catch my breath. 
     That's when I felt something push up my throat. Coughing and gaging again I kept feeling this thing crawl up my throat. Trying to sit up I kept coughing oozing out of my mouth and nose almost suffocating me this grey sludge started to pour out of my body. I kept trying to vomit it out the air that was being pushed out created bubbles in the goop. It looked like it was breathing. Alive. Like it was using my throat as a way to grow and live. After an eternity it all came out with a sickening wet and squishy thud. Gasping I looked at what came out me. It looked like a mixture of mould and mucus. It moved only when the water hit it. It made it look alive. Soon it just went down the drain. I was able to get out of the shower my whole body shaking. 
       I write this months later. I am fully better I am no longer gaging, no more disgusting smells, no more hospital visits. I do however think about what that thing was and why it was in me. ",1,1751330194.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I live in Minnesota, and I travel to Indianapolis and south Central Indiana multiple times a year. It's been increasingly lonely for me the more I travel, since it seems that the friends I've made here have moved on. (⁠´⁠;⁠︵⁠;⁠`⁠) 

I still have hope that maybe someone could be my friend when I travel. Could that person be you? All I'm asking is for someone to care when I come back to Indiana, and hopefully we can meet up in person and have a coffee or tea together. Any gender or orientation is welcome, as I am seeking a genuine friend. 

About me: I am a special ed teacher's aide, and I've completed my second year doing it, so still new. I enjoy going to art galleries/museums, other museums, taking walks in parks, enjoying beauty and nature in general. I like to draw and sing, and I enjoy discovering new music artists. Some of the genres I'm into are indie folk, folk punk, ska punk, roots reggae, new wave, synth wave, psychedelic rock, musical theater, Latin. I recently started going to live music events last year, and I want to continue doing so. I enjoy celebrating diversity and learning about new things and different people and cultures. I also enjoy movies and animation, discussing them, and listening to YouTube videos essays on them. I enjoy horror movies, but I consider myself a novice fan, since there's a lot of classics I haven't seen. In addition to tea, I like other sweets like cake, and of course Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese food. I don't ascribe to any religion, as I am an agnostic atheist, and I am politically leftist, since I'm nonbinary and bi. 

You: Chill, friendly person, maybe from the area, or maybe you travel a lot to Indiana like I do. Wanderer/explorer, since we'd be riding the buses to get around. Enjoyer of beauty and music like me.  Being queer isn't necessary, though it would be nice, since we would have that in common, and I wouldn't have to explain as many things. Not being a conservative or a liberal is a must. 

IMPORTANT: (Please, no affairs, I am not here to help you cheat, so please do not solicit something I did not consent to.)

If you got this far, please tell me the name of a new song/musician or movie/episode of a TV show you recently enjoyed.

1lonxd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/numerology/comments/1lonxd8/numbers_came_to_me_in_a_dream_tiny_lottery_win/,Numbers came to me in a dream - tiny lottery win,"TL;DR: These numbers came to me in a dream, I couldn’t input them, put on a lucky dip instead, I won £5 - what is it all about??

So, to premise this, I’m not a ‘numerology person’. I was talking to a friend of mine about how freaky I found what happened and she threw out the numerology concept and I’ve been reading up on it since - I’m hoping I can maybe find more answers here.

To preface this further, I *rarely* put money in the lottery, literally once a year, maybe twice, if the notion takes - it’s not habitual is the take away point here.

Last night I was sleeping and I woke up in a panic, like I felt what I can only describe as like a sort of anxious pressure in my chest (I don’t suffer from anxiety or anything like it) and a string of numbers came to me really quickly, likes *rapid* white flashes. I keep a pencil by my bed to mark/annotate books I read (sue me), and there was a bit of scrap paper lying next to it, I grabbed it, and wrote down the numbers and went back to sleep.

24 19 15 1 8 30

I woke up and had the thought of “what was that all about?” but still had that icky feeling in my chest. Got up, had breakfast and about half through my coffee I just had this overwhelming urge to put numbers on the lottery… The way the numbers were selected didn’t allow me to use 30 for the lucky ball, so I just decided to put on two lucky dips instead. 

The numbers that won were:

03 08 14 17 25 09

Backwards, and with a little maths, my numbers read:

03
8
15 - 1 = 14
19 = take the 9, use the 1 
24 + 1 = 25
17 = N/A

I had 4/5 of the numbers… kinda! And the part that’s freaking me out the most? The scrap bit of paper I reached for? It had my banking details on the back of it from when I had a day trying to sort my finances - I didn’t even realise at the time!??

What does it all mean? 🫠

For most of my life, my dad was a blurry memory and a birthday card every few years with the wrong age written inside.

A few months ago, he reached out. Said he regretted being absent, that he was getting older, and wanted to “be a part of my life again.” I was skeptical, but I met him for coffee. It was awkward. He didn’t know anything about me. But I was stupidly hopeful.

We kept meeting up. Texted a bit. I invited him to my apartment once. I felt like maybe, finally, I’d get that piece of my heart back.

Then last week, I saw a photo on Facebook: him, his wife, and my half-brother celebrating my dad’s 50th birthday. I wasn’t invited. Not even mentioned.

When I asked why, he said, “I didn’t think it was your kind of thing.” That hit like a truck.

I realize now he didn’t come back for me. He came back for his own guilt. I was just another checkbox. Reconciliation theater.

I met Angela a few years ago. She was best friends with a friend (19, f - let's call her Sam) of my best friend (19, f - let's call her Erin). Me, Erin, Sam, Angela and their friend M (19, also f) have hang out irl 2 times before, going for coffee both of these times. Erin invited me for a club night at some point with our mutual friend Amanda (19, f), but due to class I couldn't go. So now bear in mind, that all girls KNOW each other.

Me and Angela have each other added on Instagram, but we never talked aside from the occasional reply to a story. I don't remember how, but a few days ago, maybe even a week(?), we started talking a lot more. Angela is extremely cute; she's shorter than me, has very pretty eyes and out of the entire friend group, she shares my interests the most. 

The ""talking"" phase we are in right now, basically includes compliments, talking about our days, work and sending reels. At some point, I decided to be brave and ask her if she wants to hang out, just the two of us. She agreed (WOOO!!!) and we will be hanging out this Friday. 

I've been convincing myself that the way she sees me is purely platonic, considering we don't know each other extremely well. HOWEVER, I've been second guessing things after some reels that she liked ended up on my fyp. These videos had captions like: ""Waiting for them to make the first move, because i don't know if they are throwing hints or if I'm delusional"" or ""manifesting this ends up on their fyp so they make the first move"". 

Now, I don't know if these have anything to do with the entire situation, but the fact that she has LIKED them and seems interested in me, makes me think I might have a chance. So here's where I need advice and other people's opinions: do I make a move on Friday immediately or do I wait to see how it goes? I'm extremely nervous and I don't want to freak her out by being too quick, nor do I want her to think that I'm not into her.

The shop is a community hub, generally loved by most residents. No business is beloved by 100% of people 100% of the time though: sometimes customers will have a sub optimal experience. That's life, and comes with the territory of being a small business owner. Negative reviews are part and parcel of running a small business.

A few months ago someone left an absolutely scathing one star review for her. He said that when he brought his drink back (which he was returning because it was too hot????) the barista emptied half his drink, refilled it and represented it back to him as if it was a new one. We checked the video and no such thing happened (we have video evidence & 100% confidence that this did not happen). The barista made him a fresh new drink, jumping him to the top of the line as is standard practice when someone returns their drink. His review called out my wife by name and incorrectly named a former barista, libeling both in the process. Additionally he left a second review on a different platform AND angrily reached out to my wife on LinkedIn. Bear in mind that my wife is in the cafe every single day, and is always available to speak with customers. She was there the day he was in the shop, and remembers him storming off swearing.

As I researched who this reviewer was to try and understand who was making shit up about the business I realized that his name was vaguely familiar to me and that they were related to an acquaintance of mine in town. I texted that person to try and find out if I was right and they expressed being uncomfortable with the fact that I had reached out to them. A week or so later my acquaintance's wife pulled me aside at a kids party and told me they felt threatened by me reaching out.

AITA for reaching out to this acquaintance to try and confirm that it was their relative who left the shitty review? I didn't ask them to mention it to their relative, didn't threaten anyone, didn't ask them to take it down or be aggressive in any way. I was just direct about the fact that I was trying to work out who had left this shitty, anonymous review. I was and remain extremely pissed off that someone felt it was OK to take their frustrations out this way. I suspect that they (my acquaintance) is weirded out by the fact that I was able to identify that their relative was the one who left the review, but honesty the 'research' I did amounted to a few clicks on some previous reviews, then putting two and two together.

We are invested both emotionally and financially, have shared properties. My partner has been cheated on in the past and he’s still not able to trust easily to this day. I have an ex that’s still around as a friend. Because SO really dislikes this ex, I stepped way back and minimized my contact with my ex. We work for the same company so I’ve kept it at a colleague/acquaintance level connection with him. I got laid off earlier this year and so my ex has been checking in more than usual and offered his help to connect me with leads. One day I had a networking thing and had 30 mins free before that, and I briefly met ex for coffee. Somehow, photos and videos of us at the coffee shop next to office got sent to my SO. The problem was, I did not tell him about this even though he asked. At that time, I was just so stressed and didn’t feel like rejecting help and camaraderie from a friend, but also know how my SO would feel about it and so, I LIED.

The fallout:  understandably, SO felt hurt and his trust betrayed. I questioned the whole foundation of this relationship as well, seeing how I did not have enough confidence in my SO to be honest about something like this. And I hate lying. 

He insisted on therapy. This is a problem I have been putting aside as job hunting is more urgent to me at this time. I offered to cut off ex, and that brought peace for about 2 months.

He now insists again on couple therapy and I have agreed. However, my question is, now that I’m forced to process it, I want a separation. That would mean him and his son moving out of my house as I want to have space to process this. Or at the very least, they’ll have to keep out of my way and give me the space I need. This means not cooking, cleanings for them etc. stop acting like a family, simply because the relationship is broken and need fixing, we shouldn’t all act like it’s not. 

Am I going about this the wrong way? This feels like punishing him for wanting to fix things, but this is what I will need to dig deep into my own feelings and needs and process this. I might decide this is too much baggage and too little trust for me to continue being together. I can’t act normal while doing this.

## Key Features Analysis

The best game tables and chairs in 2025 aren't just about aesthetics; they incorporate thoughtful design and durable construction to enhance gameplay. Let's examine some core features:

**Table Size and Shape:**

The ideal table size depends heavily on the types of games you play and the number of players. For smaller card games or intimate board game sessions, a square or round table with a diameter of 48 to 60 inches may suffice. Larger board games, role-playing games, and miniatures games often demand rectangular tables ranging from 6 to 8 feet in length and 3 to 4 feet in width. Consider the playing area required by your favorite games to ensure sufficient space for components, player boards, and accessories.

**Playing Surface Material:**

The playing surface significantly impacts the tactile experience. Felt provides a smooth, non-slip surface ideal for card shuffling and dice rolling. It's also relatively forgiving if pieces are accidentally dropped. Microfiber suede offers a similar feel with enhanced durability and stain resistance. Laminate surfaces are practical for their easy cleaning and resistance to spills, but may lack the premium feel of fabric-covered surfaces. Consider your preferences regarding feel,maintenance,and durability when choosing a playing surface.

**Chair Ergonomics and Comfort:**

Comfort is paramount during extended gaming sessions. Look for chairs with adjustable height settings to accommodate different table heights and user preferences. Lumbar support is crucial for maintaining proper posture and reducing back strain. Padded seats and backrests,made from materials such as memory foam or breathable mesh,contribute significantly to overall comfort. Armrests, whether fixed or adjustable, can also enhance support and reduce fatigue.

**Accessory Storage and Integration:**

Integrated storage solutions are highly desirable for keeping gaming components organized and readily accessible.Cup holders prevent spills that could damage games. Dedicated card slots and component trays help streamline setup and gameplay. Some tables even feature hidden compartments for storing rulebooks, dice, and other accessories. Consider the storage needs of your game collection and prioritize tables with relevant integrated storage features.**Material Durability and Construction Quality:**

A game table and chairs represent a significant investment, so durability and construction quality are paramount. Solid wood construction, like oak or maple, offers excellent stability and longevity. Steel frames provide robust support for chairs and tables alike. Look for reinforced joints and durable finishes that can withstand frequent use and potential spills.Read reviews to assess the reported lifespan and resistance to wear and tear before making a purchase.

**Convertibility and Multi-Functionality:**

Many modern game tables offer convertibility, transforming into dining tables, desks, or even poker tables. Removable playing surfaces, reversible tops, and adjustable heights enhance versatility. This functionality is especially valuable for individuals with limited space who want a table that can serve multiple purposes. Consider whether you need a dedicated gaming space or a multi-functional piece of furniture that can adapt to different needs.

## FAQs Section

**What is the ideal height for a game table and chairs?**
The ideal height for a game table is typically between 28 and 30 inches, measured from the floor to the top of the playing surface.

Adjustable chair heights are highly recommended to accommodate different body types and table heights.

**What materials are best for a durable and long-lasting game table?**

**How can I protect my game table from spills and damage?**
Consider adding a waterproof mat or table cover that can be easily wiped clean. Cup holders are a must-have accessory to prevent accidental spills. Avoid placing hot or sharp objects directly on the playing surface.Regularly clean the table with a soft cloth and appropriate cleaning solutions to remove dust, dirt, and grime.

I want to make things right. And saying goodbye is necessary to be able to do that. Maybe I just got used to being the one who gets ghosted — that's why I feel bad just imagining saying goodbye to you for good. I hope you find the courage to talk openly about everything, about us, from there, maybe we can bid our last farewell. Thank you for the good times.

1lonqns,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1lonqns/i_get_stuck_for_45_hours_every_morning_please_help/,I get “stuck” for 4-5 hours every morning. Please help.,"I saw the recent post on dissociation and realized maybe that’s what’s happening with me.

I get couch-locked every morning. I wake up, make coffee, maybe some food, but I still feel tired (I am super not a morning person). So I sit on the couch. And I just get stuck there. It’s almost impossible to get up, even when I have to pee or am hungry. 

I used to play games on my phone, but I’ve quit that and now either read or play Suduko from a book. I knew that this would be less addictive than my phone, but it’s not all that much less.

I just have such a hard time getting my day started. It often means that I end up having to work late into the evening to get all my work done. I can’t attend dinners or go out, because of my stupidly long morning.

I have adhd but am living in a country where I can’t get proper medication for it, unfortunately. So that obviously doesn’t help. But before I got diagnosed at age 30 I didn’t have this issue.

FWIW I have cptsd from childhood and likely ptsd from an incident 3 years ago. I’m overall doing better than I was even last year, but life still feels like a real slog. I want my motivation and energy back! I’m embarrassed I get stuck like this. 

Any ideas? I’ve done IFS. I should start meditating again. I honestly think dating will help because I’m motivated when another person is around. But then I go back to being stuck once they leave (no more masking I guess). I can’t drink caffeine. I really need to figure this out. ",16,1751329139.0,CPTSD,10,1.0,False

I’m a 35-year-old nerdy guy from New England who’s deeply into conventions, gaming, and cosplay. Fun fact: I even made my own dating site. (Yes, really.)

Outside of cosplay as Eddie Munson from Stranger Things, Leon from Resident Evil along others, I take pride in dressing well, staying active with workouts, and—believe it or not—entering raffles and sweepstakes, which I tend to win more often than I should. Life’s been an interesting ride, including being featured on the local news for my fandom passions.

I’m looking to meet a woman who’s into nerdy things, likes to travel, and wants to build a meaningful connection. Cosplay is totally optional—it’s more about sharing good vibes, geeking out, and seeing where things go. A casual coffee would be a great start if you’re local.

so my question is, 
1. does anyone take and like their elite pills?  did you have the same side effects?  what are your thoughts?  

2. if you’re an elite lover like me, are there generics you’ve tried that are similar?  are there generics you like better than elite?  

please only answer if you take elite and like it!!  i know i can find tons of people raving about certain generics but i am on a mission to find a better generic than elite and from my experience, people who actually enjoy elite have similarly different experiences with other generics.",1,1751328166.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

1. Add packet of starter to 1 Tbsp flour and 1 Tbsp of room temperature water in a quart-size glass jar and stir thoroughly.Cover the jar with a coffee filter or breathable material secured with rubber band and culture the starter in a warm place (70-80°F) for 12-24 hours,
2.After 12-24 hours,feed the starter with an additional 2 Tbsp of flour and 2 tbsp water.Stir thoroughly,
3.After 12-24 hours,feed the starter with an additional 1/4 cup of flour and 1/4 cup water.Stir thoroughly,
4.After 12-24 hours,feed the starter with an additional ½ cup of flour and ½ cup water.Stir thoroughly,
5.Discard down to ½ cup starter and then feed the starter with ½ cup water and ½ cup flour.Stir thoroughly,
6.Repeat step 5 every 12-24 hours for 3-7 days.
Do this until the starter has the consistency of pancake batter and is bubbling regularly within a few hours of feeding.That’s when your starter is activated and ready to use",2,1751328023.0,Sourdough,1,1.0,False
1loncfu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1loncfu,Is this some kind of known paint problem that I should be aware of? Or did I spill something and just never noticed until now?,"
I opened my driver door the other day and noticed this weird, oily, crumbly stuff all over the sill.

On closer inspection, it's the paint!! There's some kind of greasy liquid (*pale yellowish, completely odorless*) on the sill, and the paint underneath it is blistering up. 

I really don't think I spilled anything there to cause it. It's just that one section under the door, and it's not like I'm getting into and out of my car everyday with coffee mugs full of acetone and dichloromethane.

Does one of the motors in the door have some kind of oil in it that might do this if it leaked? Is the greasy stuff a red herring, and there was just a batch of 23's that came off the line with panels that weren't cleaned properly before they went into the paint booth?",3,1751328021.0,MachE,5,0.8,False

I do not intent to spoil your experience and fun you might be having.

Having that said. I do have one big complaint which really spoils the game for me and that is the fact that **Mk2 Pipelines** **do NOT have a 600 m³ of fluid per minute throughput**.

To give some context. I have already finished the game a while ago (twice). Fulfilled all the goals set by ADA, got all the achievements possible, researched everything etc., etc..

Because I do love the game and wanted to continue building I decided to make a 100,000mw Turbo Fuel Power Plant.

So.. I started building. The oil extractors, the water pumps, the compacted coal factories. All what is needed for the power plant want to build. I have a great Excel sheet which allows me to calculate exactly what I need, how much I need and what I have already build/have. I have multiple (auto connecting) blueprints to help speed up the build. All the basics are there. According to my calculations it should be enough or even more than enough for some resources.

Skip to the final part of the build: 400 Fuel Powered Generators.

After building the generators and while connecting them I noticed I never reached full capacity. In the beginning I thought the pipelines just need to fill up, maybe I need to add some pumps here or there, added valves, looping the start and the end of a manifold. Everything I could think of to fix the issue at hand.

Getting desperate I started to search for answers online. After a couple of searches I found out this is a know bug. It has been for a long already. There are some work arounds out there like splitting everything into 300 m³ of fluid per minute throughput. So, starting in with generators I started to split up things into 300 m³ of fluid per minute. Only to discovery now I don't have enough fuel. And if I would fix the fuel the fuel I don't have enough water and/or crude oil..

**My entire design is using Mk2 pipelines and expects them to work properly!**

Conclusion. to get a steady 100,000mw out of my setup. I would have to tear down most of what I've build and keep implementing work arounds during the entire rebuild.

Coming to realize this I am at the point of totally giving up on the game.

If you do everything as efficient as possible according to rules set by the game and it still doesn't work and the game forces you to implement work arounds. It's just not right. Specially with a game as Satisfactory where maximum efficiency is a huge part of the game.

And I know, I could get to whole 100,000mw out of my setup. Best shortcut yet is to add some somersloops in critical location to compensate for the fact that other parts of the factory are running idle. But I just don't want to anymore.

I really consider putting this game in the freezer until Coffee Stain comes up with a fix.

Convince me otherwise?!

I have been staying in Budapest for around 3 months and me and my partner are not too versed in the kitchen which means a lot of eating out 😂 so these are my favourite spots. 


Brunch:

• Cafe Muse - our FAVOURITE spot in Budapest!!! The food is really tasty and they have a huge selection of drinks. I have tried a few different things from the menu and they have all been good! 

• Törökméz - on Buda side. the cafe was really cute and has a lovely outside seating area that’s perfect for the summer. the food was very very nice and also looked pretty!!

• Sirap brunch&more - teddy bear coffee! although gimmicky it is super cute and the food was amazing! i think it is owned by the woman who works there and considering she was the only server she was so nice and catered to our needs! 

• Budapest Baristas - the food was nice and came quickly. they had a variety of eggs benedict options and even included salmon caviar on their eggs royal which offered a twist to what can sometimes be a super repetitive dish. 


Mexican:

• Iguana Bar and Grill - some great mexican food! this was the only mexican restaurant i tried in the city but i saw a lot of recommendations. the cocktails were SO good! also the guacamole was amazing! 


Japanese:

• Hachi Budapest - for lunch, the canteen lunch menu was better than the dinner menu imo

• Wafu - again probably best for lunch as you can get a bigger portion for cheaper than the dinner menu. they have an amazing lemonade! 

• Kawaruma Ramen - a cute little ramen restaurant. it felt authentically japanese and the ramen was tasty. i would recommend checking the menu before you go though as there isnt too many options. 


Italian

• Tom George Osteria - while it can be busy and a reservation is probably necessary this feels like a cozy italian restaurant. we sat outside in february when it was cold but due to their heat lamps it was warm and nice. i really enjoyed our meal there recently and 2 years ago when we first visited Budapest. 

• Amore’ - Pasta e Basta - Buda side, very friendly staff! Decent prices and very tasty food. This is one of my favourite spots in Budapest as it was great value for money especially for families where the italian restaurants in the inner city usually cost an arm and a leg! the lemonade was also great! 


Steak

• Pampas Argentin Steakhouse - service was amazing!! felt very fancy and wasn’t too badly priced for a very nice steak restaurant. the meat was cooked to my liking and the sides were nice. 


Honourable mentions

• Cecha Matcha - best matcha in Budapest and very aesthetically pleasing

• Matcha Tsuki - another great matcha place with lots of options

• Smashy burger - i do think it lives up to the tourist hype, i really liked my burger hahaha

• Manos Gyros and More - a takeaway kebab place with the best kebabs i have had in Budapest",2,1751327112.0,budapest,1,1.0,False

Save you the details, but over the course of months we would hear yelling and screams from the house next door. Not a town house, a stand alone house. So it was loud. I've called the police more than once on the apparent DV taking place. 

One day we got to talking with the wife and she had bruises on her arm and a gnarly cut on her leg. That was from being put through a glass coffee table.

Eventually she would come spend the night to get away and I'd patch her up. I was in the military and an EMT in those days and had a trauma bag at home. I also used to open carry a pistol which, was legal there. That'll be important in a minute.

She refused to call the police saying that he was a mortician in town and had a lot of cop friends. That it wouldn't go her way. 

One day he got pissed we'd help her out.  So he made a false report to the police that I threatened him with my gun. So a sheriff's deputy rang my doorbell one afternoon with a restraining order that was going to compell me to move. 

Problem was, I sold the gun a month before this supposed event.....to a cop. My girlfriend at the time was friends with a social worker, who was dating said cop. 

I called him up (cop) and explained what happened. He essentially went over there, with picture of my old gun, with a ruler next to it as if it were ""evidence"".

He asked neighbor if this was the gun, neighbor said yes. he asked neighbor if that was the correct date, he said yes. So, he serves him with a ticket for making false report and the restraining order went away.

Next time neighbor sees me outside, he made general threats. Well, I just got my discharge from the air force so I was moving back home to the east coast. And just before I did, I went to his backyard with a shoot of bamboo that I cut into 4-in pieces and a rubber mallet. I randomly drove them all over his backyard. 

That same week I also brought his wife to a women's shelter. 

It basically overtook his backyard. He will never get rid of that bamboo.

Inside, the first thing to become visible was a sock.

It stomped once, sharply, as though making a point. A second later, the rest of its owner began to flicker into view—marine-grade stealth armor shedding its shimmer, revealing a scowling face and a sheen of sweat.

More shapes followed. Heads. Shoulders. Elbows. Boots. All angry.

They did not speak.

They looked at each other, then at the cadet who informed them.

An unused spray-paint can rolled into a corner.

The medic approached. To take the readings from the suits. The sweaty faces confirmed there were still heat issues.

The cadet looked from one marine to the other. ""Are you sure we shouldn't quarantine time?""

The medic tried to speak, but needed his inhalator first. He looked like a person just coming from the toilet for a second. Then he turned his rolling eyes on the cadet.

""They never went outside. Don't be—""

He needed another puff—the humid air taking away his breath.

""…daft,"" the medic finally concluded.

The cadet now turned to the medic. ""Are you sure you are alright?""

Restricted access only

Contamination class 1/z98. Activate protocol W31c.

The captain read it again. Nanites or a biological equivalent. Deadly. No known countermeasures. Extremely contagious.

His eyes tensed when coming to the protocol. Self-destruct at positive signs of contamination. The entire ship, with all personnel.

The threat is too big for HQ to take any chances. They nearly died when they were too far from the dreadnoughts. And now he might have doomed his crew for getting too close.

He thought of their young faces. Exhilarated when they fired the point defenses. Silent when they saw a dreadnought deleted. Laughing at the birthday prank.

He clenched his fist.

“God dammit.”

He was alone, but still he spoke again, unable to hold back.

“God dammit. Of all the shittiest—“

His voice broke off. He looked at the wall, but his focus was miles further. He then used his communicator.

""Tea, please.""

The first officer, jumpy from the strange message, overheard the request.

Tea? This was even more serious than he thought. The captain never drinks tea. He left the young pilot in command and went to the captain’s quarters.

“John,” the captain started. The captain had never addressed him with his first name. He thought the captain didn’t even know.

The first officer blinked. It was silent for a second. He saw the captain’s eyes were red and swollen. It was silent for a second. Then the captain started again.

“John, it is terrible. In case of contamination we are ordered to self-destruct.”

The first officer’s face turned pale. “What? Why?”

“They did not even trust us. Just the order. A letter and a number deciding our fate.” The captain sounded different. Old.

The captain took a bottle and two glasses from a compartment John had never seen before. The ship had more secrets than John knew, or wanted to know.

Meanwhile in the mess, the regular order had more or less returned. The nearby dreadnought still posed as a surreal city landscape.

“Still not convinced?” The marine approached the doctor for what must have been the umpteenth time.

She smiled tiredly. “Convinced of what?”

“Me being irresistible. What else?” The marine stood there confident. Knowing full well this would be another blue exit.

The doctor shook her head, sighing. “Not everyone is in love with their mirror-image.”

There were a few more marines in the mess hall. They just completed their training and smelled of sweat. Watching the scene unfold, one remarked, “Popcorn?”

‘Helios’, or Sunnyboy as the others called him, still wore part of his power armor, waiting till the water recycling was fixed to take a shower.

The marine was not stopped that easily. “Who would not be, if you were me?”

“I would wear a stealth suit, if I were you.” The deadpan reply from Spades raised some cheers.

“I’m the breacher, I always get through, and I’m always the first,” Sunnyboy was not held back for a second.

The doctor stood up. “I guess I will see you soon in bed then—as a patient.”

Accompanied with some whooping, she left the mess, and the marine thoroughly blue.

Short after, an alarm sounded. The dreadnoughts picked up speed. Soon, they went faster than the UNS Europe could keep up with. Slowly the giants left in the distance. It was not a true relief. It was a delay.

In the quiet that followed, Spades retrieved the spray-can from the corner it rolled into, muttering ""It will be of later use."" Just like him, there were many others not yet ready with these giants.

Thinking, he walked to the mess, when an itch caught him off guard. He stopped and scratched the inside of his knee pit. It smelled odd. Curious, he brought his fingers to his nose and sniffed.

A young cadet, barely out of childhood, stepped closer. “You too?” he asked, voice low, scratching the inside of his elbow with slow, deliberate movements.

He was in charge of missile command. Hadn’t flinched when he fired the CAD. Now, his jaw was clenched. He looked anything but calm.

“What’s up with you two?” the second officer asked, his tone sharper than usual—distrust creeping in.

“Nothing. Just an itch,” Spades replied, still scratching like it was nothing.

The second officer studied them silently. Usually polite, always with a nod or quiet word. Now, he just turned and walked away.

The second officer was nowhere to be seen. They called him Mr. Pancakes — in charge of the chorus roster, notorious for never cleaning a thing. He got away with it by baking the best pancakes for breakfast.

There were no pancakes this morning.

When the captain finally permitted camera use, they found him in his quarters. Scrubbing.

Thick yellow gloves. Medical mask. Hunched over a bucket. Face twisted in a grimace not unlike pain.

The light of his communicator flickered. He didn’t look at it. He just dipped his cloth again.

“You must clean too,” he rasped. “Before it’s too late. Clean everything.”

And he scrubbed. Again. And again.

It hurt the captain to watch.

Whatever this was, it wouldn’t be stopped with plastic gloves and a mask. Not with the orders he’d received.

Days later the water recycling was still down. A long line stretched outside the doctor’s office, everyone keeping their distance. It reached nearly to the mess hall.

Sunnyboy was first in line—he’d arrived before anyone else. With a pained expression, he stepped inside.

“It’s… it’s not contamination, is it?” he asked, the bravado from before nowhere to be found.

The doctor studied him for a moment. “Burns.” She sniffed the air. “Definitely soap.”

“I thought it would help against the rash,” he admitted.

“Dumbass,” she said. “Soap burns if it stays on your skin that long.”

Sunnyboy’s face turned red. He stood and started toward the door. Just before leaving, he paused and glanced back. “I was the first.”

As the door closed behind him, he heard her softly repeat, “Dumbass.”

Her feet hurt after the line had shortened a bit, her head reeling. She would never get through today. Something had to be done.

The doctor barged into the captain’s office without knocking.

“We’ve got a crew half-convinced they’re infected with alien spores, and I can’t even give them a proper wash,” she snapped. “This is getting out of hand.”

The captain didn’t look up right away. His uniform was rumpled, collar askew. A cold cup of coffee sat untouched at his side, and his eyes were puffy, red-rimmed from lack of sleep.

“What is it?” he asked.

“Mold,” she said, exhaling as she dropped into the seat opposite him. “Low-grade skin fungus. Harmless, mostly. Rashes, itching. Classic conditions—humidity, no washing. But fear spreads faster than spores.”

Halden ran a hand over his face. “You’re saying my crew is losing their minds over mildew.”

“I’m saying they’re spiraling,” she replied, making a slow circling motion with her finger. “What did HQ say? You look worse than the cadets.”

He stayed silent.

That was answer enough.

Her voice softened. “That bad?”

After a beat, she stood. “I’ll brief the crew. Downplay everything. Powders, creams, whatever we’ve got. No decon theater. Just common sense.”

Halden nodded, eyes still fixed on the wall. “Do it.”

They struggled. Held a movie-night. And above all they smelled. It gave the captain an itch too. He wished he could shout at someone. Give an order. His thoughts were interrupted when the communications officer signaled there was a message.

""Maintain contamination vigilance for at least one hour. Then proceed with the mission.""

The captain cursed. The message had been 4 days late. Four fucking days of paranoia. He could strangle those pencil pushers at the headquarters. Even that would be too good for them, he thought while cooling down.

More pencil pushing was the hell they deserved. Satisfied by a made-up vengeance, he read the rest:

""Blink-tug Camel 447 en route. ETA 100 hours.""

He looked again at the time the message was supposed to be sent. There were only hours left. Hours to get everyone vaguely presentable. At least he got word the recycling had been fixed. He picked up his communicator and set it to @all.

""Rinse and shine everyone.""

Where first the corridors were humid, near the showers it was now outright misty. The scratching queue in front of the doctor’s had been displaced to these misty halls.

Clean towels were delivered just too late. A daring team was drying freshly washed towels with the afterburner from the landing craft. Today the navy was skin-colored.

The doctor reported in with the captain. ""It's cadets and buns everywhere.""",6,1751326908.0,HFY,5,0.81,False

1lomvon,https://v.redd.it/9z10q212g5af1,History of Modern Guatemala,"Distinguished guests, ladies, and gentlemen,
Today, I want to take you on a journey through the captivating and often complex history of modern Guatemala. From the ashes of colonial rule to the struggles and triumphs of a young republic, Guatemala's path has been one of resilience, rich cultural heritage, and a persistent pursuit of a more equitable future.
Our story begins in the early 19th century, as the winds of independence swept across Latin America. After centuries under Spanish colonial rule, Guatemala, then part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala, declared its independence in 1821. This was not a singular, unified act, but rather a series of events leading to the formation of the Federal Republic of Central America. However, this grand vision of a united Central America was short-lived. Internal divisions, economic disparities, and regional rivalries ultimately led to the dissolution of the federation, and in 1847, Guatemala formally declared itself an independent republic.
The latter half of the 19th century saw the rise of liberal reforms, often spearheaded by strongmen leaders. This era brought significant changes, including the privatization of communal lands and the promotion of coffee as the primary export crop. While this integrated Guatemala into the global economy, it also concentrated wealth and land in the hands of a few, laying the groundwork for future social and economic inequalities.
The early 20th century was marked by a series of dictatorships, most notably that of Manuel Estrada Cabrera, who ruled for over two decades. His iron-fisted rule, though bringing some modernization, was characterized by political repression and a lack of democratic freedoms. This period also saw significant U.S. influence, particularly through the United Fruit Company, which became a powerful economic and political force within the country.
A pivotal moment arrived in 1944 with the ""October Revolution."" This popular uprising, fueled by widespread dissatisfaction with authoritarian rule and social injustice, ushered in a decade of democratic reform known as the ""Ten Years of Spring."" During this period, presidents Juan José Arévalo and Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán implemented progressive policies aimed at social welfare, labor rights, and agrarian reform. Árbenz's land reform program, which sought to redistribute uncultivated lands to landless peasants, directly challenged the interests of powerful landowners and, crucially, the United Fruit Company.
This era of reform, however, was tragically cut short. In 1954, a CIA-backed coup, driven by Cold War anxieties and corporate interests, overthrew Árbenz. This event plunged Guatemala into decades of political instability and, tragically, a brutal civil war.
The Guatemalan Civil War, lasting from 1960 to 1996, was a devastating conflict that pitted government forces against various leftist insurgent groups. It was a period marked by extreme violence, human rights abuses, and the systematic repression of indigenous populations, who bore the brunt of the conflict. The war's legacy is immense, leaving deep scars on Guatemalan society, including widespread displacement, trauma, and a persistent struggle for justice and reconciliation.
The signing of the Peace Accords in 1996 brought an end to the armed conflict, ushering in a new era of hope and challenges. Since then, Guatemala has grappled with the difficult process of rebuilding, strengthening democratic institutions, and addressing the root causes of the conflict, including poverty, inequality, and historical injustices.
Today, Guatemala stands at a crossroads. It is a nation of incredible natural beauty and a vibrant indigenous culture that has endured centuries of adversity. Yet, it continues to face significant challenges, including corruption, organized crime, migration pressures, and the ongoing need to improve living conditions for all its citizens.
The history of modern Guatemala is a testament to the resilience of its people. It is a story of a nation striving to define its own destiny, to overcome a painful past, and to build a more just and prosperous future. As we reflect on this complex journey, let us remember the lessons learned, honor the sacrifices made, and continue to support Guatemala in its ongoing pursuit of peace, justice, and true development.
Thank you.

1lomtaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lomtaf/aitah_for_having_a_threesome_with_my_exs_friend/,AITAH for having a threesome with my ex’s friend and not telling him,"My ex was avoidant, and we only dated for four months. We were sleeping together for a lot longer than that— a year and half, with many on and off phases. 

It took a long time for him to be willing to commit to me, and even when he did commit, the relationship did not meet my needs at all which he blamed on me being too needy. The only good part about this relationship was how close I got to his friends and roommates, who became friends of my own. One of his roommates was seeing a bi girl who had a crush on me. They loved watching us flirt with each other. 

The day of my birthday party my ex told me he wasn’t interested in having sex with me anymore. He said that it was too high stakes because he felt too much pressure around my pleasure.  He saw as another need he felt inadequate at meeting. The girl I mentioned earlier that his friend/roommate was seeing came to my birthday party and we got drunk and he encouraged us to make out in front of him. He got turned on by this and wanted a threesome. We even went so far as to go up to his roommates room and make out in there to which my then-bf was saying he is being a bad friend for. We ended up going back downstairs but invited the girl to join us if she wanted to during the night, she didn’t— mostly because she’s not attracted to my ex. 

The next morning my ex finally had sex with me. But the whole time, he was pretending it was a threesome with this girl, even mentioning her name during sex, which made me feel really icky. He liked her photos on instagram that day too. Our sex life was really good for a couple days because he was so turned on by what had happened. 

We broke up a week later. My ex, the avoidant he is, moved on quickly. He didn’t even shed a tear when he broke up with me. He said I had too many feelings and needs. He went to a party without me and brought a girl over very soon after the breakup. A girl he’d been friends with while we were dating. 

I continued hanging out with our mutual friends, such as his roommate. One time I hung out with the roommate and the girl he’d been seeing. We got really drunk and had a threesome a month after the breakup. We all agreed to not mention it again because it would be unnecessarily messy and cause drama in the house. So we didn’t. I wasn’t on speaking terms with my ex at that point anyway. 

A month or so after that, said roommate had a bday party at the house he invited me to. I went. My ex was following me around flirting with me the entire night. He kept encouraging me to drink more and trying to get me to sleepover. I did, and we had sex. The next morning he tried to pretend it didn’t happen. He didn’t text me for days after. I reached out to him to talk about it but he wanted to revert to being friends and getting coffee. I was so confused. We ended up hooking up a couple times after that, but kept getting into big fights because I wanted to have a conversation about what it meant and he wanted to keep things casual. He encouraged me to move on, to see other people, said he was doing the same thing. He even cried in front of me for the first time because he felt guilty, said it’s the worst he’s ever treated anyone and he just can’t be involved with me anymore. 

I left and didn’t talk to him for a couple months. He continued softly reaching out and liking posts and stuff, but didn’t ever try to have a conversation. Until one night, he got all flirty and nostalgic and wanted to hang out again. We ended up having sex, again. He told me it wasn’t a date, I wasn’t his gf, it didn’t mean anything. And after he didn’t talk to me for a couple weeks. I kept trying to hang out with him. To have a real conversation. But he pushed me away claiming he was super busy. I ran into him on a date with someone else. He denied it was a date. But it clearly was. And I knew I couldn’t be mad because he wanted to keep things vague and emotionally distant between us. We hadn’t had real conversations. 

And then he invited me to his college graduation party. I went. I hung around his family and friends. Me and him and said roommate from earlier played drinking games all night. We slept together again in the morning. And I felt so awful about it because I knew it wasn’t going to lead anywhere. So I went home and decided not to talk to him anymore. Every time he texted I ignored it. And then I got a call from him about 6 weeks into my silence. 

He said he heard about the threesome. He asked me to confirm it. Yes or no. Said he didn’t want to have a conversation about it. Just wanted to know if it was true because he was planning on living with that same roommate again. He knew I’d be honest. 

So I confirmed it. I told him when. And his voice cracked at the fact that it had been a year and I’d never told him. He claimed we’d been through so much. He said he was hurt every time I saw him was just for sex. But I know the truth. He abandoned me. He left. He never wanted to get back together.

He said he was embarrassed and felt like a fool being the last to know.  I tried to explain myself, but he talked over me. He did “all you had to do was say ‘yes I’m sorry’ and instead you’re picking apart my flaws” and then he hung up. And then he wouldn’t answer when I called back. And then he blocked me. 

I know I should’ve told him. But we didn’t have a conversation before sleeping together again. It always happened. And every time I’d push for conversations he’d push me away. And I would’ve betrayed my friend by telling him and ruined their friendship. It just didn’t feel like the right thing. It would’ve felt like I was rubbing it in his face. 

But I also wonder if I should try to apologize. If I’m in the wrong. But my heart is telling me not to chase this time. Not to soften it. He’s the one who encouraged me to move on, who moved on himself, who didn’t want to define things or work on the relationship despite months of effort from me. But still…

I'm a young guy still in the first part of my thirties and over the past 8 years, my weight went from 75 kg (165 lbs) to 104 kg (230 lbs). The first 10 kg (22 lbs) came on during my first office job after working in the restaurant business during my student years. It was a typical sedentary job, and I was eating about the same as my coworkers and living a similar lifestyle. The strange part is that they all stayed slim, while I steadily gained weight.

The rest of the weight built up gradually over time. For the past 3 years, my weight has been fairly stable. I don’t weigh myself often, but whenever I do, it’s usually somewhere between 215 and 225 lbs.

I’ve had my bloodwork done, and no hormonal issues showed up. However, I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea, and my doctors believe this may have been a major contributor to the weight gain.

Here’s what makes my case feel different: I’m never hungry. I wake up without an appetite and typically don’t feel the need to eat until 48hours have passed. Don't get me wrong I still eat dinner every evening. Most days that's my only meal. During the day I drink coffee and water. I avoid carbonated drinks like soda because I find them way too sweet. When I go out, I usually drink beers, although I’ve now been off alcohol for about 5ish months. Even with that lifestyle change, my weight has stayed the same.

I’ve been reading other people’s experiences with Ozempic, and many mention how it reduced their appetite, which led to weight loss. Since I already have no appetite, I’m skeptical it will make any difference for me.

Ok let's start from the very start it going to be a very long story maybe after telling this my heart will feel a little bit less uneasiness ok so i was a nerd type of kid with very strict parents i usually spent a lot of time in my room studying ig from class 6th to class 8th and 9th that's what I do or watch time but it kinda gets boring and in a day i get my parents for like 30 minutes to play games that's how my life was then my cousins introduced me with anime i watched Naruto and before that i was nerd introvert guy with less Friends and not a single female friend even so after watching anime my distance grows more often it was like i relate to the show so much i grow a fond of anime characters so much where i started to avoid real peoples so till class 10th i had like no friends at all before that i used to have good friends at class 5th but classes got shuffled and then I don't talk that much studies so till 10th i didn't make any good friends its like if i exist or not it doesn't matter to anyone till class 10th after that i decided i can't do like this and in class 11th my old friends were in the same class as me I build up confidence and i make hell lots of friends and female friends too but

 when i look deep inside i have no one who hate me because of my personality i was kind smart so I have never have a personality and when i look inside of me i found a hole that still cannot be filled i have family friends but I couldn't get open to my problems to them in friends boys have their own problem to begin with and family i can't make them worry i had no one who I could scream my problems and cry to begin with so i decided to have a person in my life who could support me in my tough time and i support her so at the start of my 11th my tution also started so I begin to go on first day I check out eveyone but then one beautiful girl came i was mesmerized i mean it was like when 

you see anyone and be like she is cute like that and on first day of class she used to answering questions she was hell smart so time went on and one she started to talking to me I was literally like there are people who talked to me like wow i had no talking skills at all but she still talk to me and then time went on and on people used to ask her in class who you like to talk to the most she told my name to them when i heard it i was so shocked its like the hole maybe it could be filled i used to travel to a certain amount of distance where my father used to come and pick me so her lane was same she wait for me and we walk together and talk everyday I don't usually have anything to talk but 

she let me engage and I also try my best by googling what should I talk to a girl lol cmon i was new and then one day she changed her stream btw it was maths she changed the stream and left the tution i asked we will still be friends she said bye you were a good friend i told her i want to know you more she said it was just a month and you are attached to me? This fast and she blocked me think of my pov i was so happy in my life and then after a month it shattered i broked completely I cried a lot like kid like why me i tried and nothing happened and in my school i don't talk to a girl after that when needed then only i was like this for 5 6 months and then i started having female friends but for me they were not that them they 

just want attention that's it so then at that time a girl let's name her rosa was in different section from me like I am maths with Hindi she was maths with cs started to hanging out with me she joined my tution as well she literally was girl that almost filled the hole in my heart she done so many things for me she waited during lunch time for me to have lunch with me now at this point my parents become a little less strict they now wait for me near my house so i travel through them with e rikshaw or anything like that rosa house were in the different route but she still drop me with her scooty everyday at that point where I could walk to my dad she some time do my assignments and I also started to treat her because she saved a lot of money for me by giving a ride she gets so close with me we hangout to temples malls coffee shops everything the whole tution and school were like 

they are dating i was like nahh but then one day I asked her did you date anyone she told me yeah but he used to smoke and drink a lot so i left him i said oh ( and i am type of boy who feels sympathy so i asked her do you miss him she said nah i was like okay but still you lov... She said nah) i told her i don't like girls who had boyfriends and they hang out with boy bestfriend i mean think about the bf i will never be friend to a girl like that she said ohh and then one day on Instagram a love type story she shared from a boy's story I was like okay maybe brother or friend it's fine and then i noticed it's happening quite a lot love couple stories i asked her about him she told me she met her online he is a college 2nd year guy we are in 12th btw. so I was like what do you like him ? She said no but he does i said okay and we still continue and one day we were hanging out in a mall she said he is coming here so i thought why don't you meet him i said like 

why I would i am here to hang out with you so she tried to stop me and i raged and go back then on the same day that boy messaged me and asked you were gone i want to meet you I was like oh what's your relationship with her he without hesitation said i am her boyfriend I was heatbroken once again i just told him take good care of her he said I would bro and i left after that i was so mad and sad sad more then and because of something we fight and didn't talked to each other for a while and one day she comes back told me everything they were some personal problems with her that's why she couldn't talk with me ( i can't tell the details in short rosa and his ex photo got leak to her mother so she was trouble) and then i asked her why you didn't told me blah blah she was like i couldn't get confidence i said fine she said trust me my bf got no problem with us it's fine it's a normal friendship I was like i couldn't say anything i said maybe for you not for me and we still remained friends i decided after 2 3 months that i should get so close with her at that point where i got upperhand than her bf because his bf college is in different city so i started to using this tactic ( i was immature ik) but it failed so bad and prove me so wrong whenever her bf come in our city his hometown is my city she didn't drop me she drop me for like just a mere km in which i still have to take e rikshaw i get so mad ( I know i was so dumb) and then after some time when I grow to more closer with her i started to see she gets closer with every boy like every literally she has so many male friends like every and she gets close to them very physically i told her that's bad blah blah 

she doesn't give a fuc. At that time now she started avoiding me and started to hanging out with her new male friends and she stopped dropping me making excuses i want to go with them at this point I was broked again i mean i was but now no hope left rosa girl bestfriend was mine friend too i told her everything she and her had Many arguments but at the end it didn't give anything it was like a cycle repeat i come home i told her bestfriend she did this and that she argues with her done rosa still do everything all over again let's name her bestfriend red so now red and me started to get closer because i complaint everyday I was not even a slightest intrested in red but she was and one day 

she proposed she was the first proposal of my life i told her to stay on hold red past was too bad i can't say anything but yeah it was not good so she gets sad she thought i had for her too but my friends explained her that nahh so it was depressing until one day let's go back in a time a little bit back then i started talking to rosa after the incident of my coaching happened but at that time two girls were talking to me let name the other world so world and rosa were both talking to me and I was like i don't want to focus on both and rosa was a little bit closer to me a little bit unlike world so i didn't talk to world and give my every time to rosa and rest everything you know ( oh btw and this time i am still a introvert so why i got attached to rosa is because of her personality so damn good for me totally extrovert on another level if i stayed silent she would engage me in the best way possible by talking that's why world is pretty like me quiet girl ) so by this time now in present this incident happened i started talking to world again (yeah yeah mean of me one girl gone so you jump to other no it was like 2. 3 months after) i was heatbroken again I was like she was so closed to fill my heart i started to tell her my problems and she listened to it and give me answers but still ) so yeah i started talking to world and i get to know she has a bf know he was like one of the trash boys of school i told her and she become mad and blocked me so I was blocked for 3 4 months so i was alone at that time fighting with rosa sometimes red talk to me she still wants to stay friends with me but now she gets jealous with rosa 

so after 3 4 months world unblocked me and talked to me once again it was like normal she told me you were right i broked with him he was cheating blah blah i was like ik it's fine and one day she proposed to me and yeah folks i accepted it it was like the end months of class 12 so yes we were in relationship yes I was so so so happy she was not that beautiful like tution girl or rosa but for me she was she did like so much things for me like did my 200+ assignments projects everything she was the first girl who I had hold hands with her hugged too (that's it) during farewell and we also go on a date with one day her family was also strict but she still manages her stream was bio btw she like we started dating in November till February i was the happiest person on the whole planet when i wake up i asked myself I am in a dream we talked like hell everything you could imagine dirty to dirty and best to best i cried to her sometimes on call telling my problems she hear it encourages me motivate yes MY HEART HOLE COMPLETED I FOUND THE PIECE THE ONE AND ONLY READER OF MY STORY but one day after valentine's week we celebrated it i also do many that i could do from my end to make my gf the happiest (i wrote long paragraphs expressing my feelings to it everyday at night so that when she woke up she saw it and smile not 

that i make vlogs for her to make her smile everyday expressing my feelings in it cringe Instragram trends i did every one of it to make her smile) so after valentine's day over she called me and told me she missed his ex i was like what? On that day she changed her Instragram password too yeah btw we shared instagram password too i stopped talking to rosa and red completely and i started to talking to any girl so not to feel her jealous she told me you don't need to but i still did she also didn't talk to boys that much sometimes but on that day she told me i missed him i was like what why now how ? She told me he messaged me he missed me too he was my first love i am sorry and she break up with me i never get so depressed and cried a lot at that time she blocked me from everywhere else i cried so much but still we talked but she said i had no feelings for you it was like i was just pretending i was heartbroken in these past months were the best moments of my life she used to wake me up good morning was fake everything I was depressed a lot nothing compared to previous just sobbing every minute literally my friends were mad at her until the day after my break up at morning she called me crying and said i am sorry i said like literally it's fine stop crying 

what happened she said nothing happened i am missing you i said what? She said I couldn't sleep at night it was first time i couldn't sleep in my entire life I was just thinking about you this time i blocked my ex i don't want him i just want you i said even if you came after 1 2 years I will always accept you because you are my first love (technically she is i never get physical hands i mean ok with any girls and told any girl i love you these words matters to me a lot) and then what everything become fine she said now it's my time to fix you i broke your heart no it's my time so she started to love me so much she started to record videos write paragraphs everything I was again so happy but ( yeah you will think I will get a happy ending nah ) at the end of March she blocked me from everywhere i was like what? I called her she told me mom finds about us so I am sorry bye I was so shocked but after a little time she revealed I can't continue i don't like your mentality and I don't feel free around you i couldn't do this we talk and i cry about this like crazy but still at the end we broked up i was so so so depressed i completely get disconnected from every person possible from March April May June i didn't talked to a single person and smile in front of my parents at that time 

i started to understand what happened and what's caused of this according to me i overloved too much first mistake i did was i told her i don't like girls or my girl wearing too much revealing clothes (yeah ik it's not bad but according to girls at this age it is) second mistake we talked like 4 5 slots on a specific time on a day like everyday it's like a schedule that you have to do it too wrong love is not like this ( and one major thing i once made women belong to a kitchen joke like literally just for a meme) i don't know she will take it seriously in future I also told her that i want my wife to have a better income than me but yeah this world only sees bad things mine world too lol so yeah that's how it ends yeah i started to connecting to my friends again but boys around this age just joke around break ups that made me depressed again they are not mature enough to know the heaviness until the same happened to them also so yeah I will go to college soon now many things happened there was dream of me to date a girl from school and marry her but some dreams can't be true 

anyways whoever is reading this thanks for your time to read this i learned from anime not to give up so should I still try and talk to her once again? You could tell me your opinions and thank you so much these past months were like black months for me just crying depressing but throughout these moments anime manga novels and the thing and still give me hope to move on in life anyways there are many plot holes in this and there are many places where i did mistakes too like i could still be friends with rosa red but i choosed not too i also did bad things to rosa i mean backstabbing type so i am not that good person at all and they are also not the proper villans more like they are anti hero anyways that's it folks it feels so good to write this i would love to hear your comments 

Yeah I need to do lots of changes because it wasn't going like this so i apologise for randoms spaces between lines but you know the drill ",1,1751325914.0,RelationshipIndia,1,1.0,False

\####-Welted Process:

It adopts a three-layer full-leather welt made by hand wrapping. This not only ensures the structural stability and durability of the shoes but also serves as a hallmark of top-tier handmade footwear.

Sole Design:

The front and heel parts are precisely spliced with rubber. While maintaining the texture of a full-leather sole, the most wear-prone areas (front and heel) are specifically reinforced with abrasion-resistant rubber, balancing elegance and practicality.

Iconic Upper Texture:

The upper is made of Box Calf (top-grain calfskin with open-edge beads). This leather features a unique high gloss and tight texture. Only high-quality, soft, and comfortable top-grain leather can shape the classic ""big head"" silhouette of Mickey shoes, which is plump, round, and highly three-dimensional.

Exquisite Lining:

The lining is equipped with customized coffee-colored cowhide leather, offering a comfortable touch and superior wearing experience.

Why are these details so important?

Defects of Poor-Quality Products

The leather's gloss, softness, and thickness may be incorrect.

The layers of the welt and handcraft traces may be rough or missing.

The position, craftsmanship, and texture of rubber splicing may appear cheap.

The lining material and color may also differ.

1lomicz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lomicz/aitah_for_losing_all_of_my_friends_after_getting/,AITAH for losing all of my friends after getting in a relationship with a man 20 years older than me?,"I, 22F, had a very close friend group until recently. About three months ago everything came crushing down.
In high school I met my best friend in the whole world 22F, let's call her Molly. Molly was also friends with my neighbor next door 22M, let's call him Jack, and the three of us became extremely close and went through high school together. After high school we all moved away from our small hometown to a city far away for college and only became closer. Molly moved in with her sister Kate 24F and we became close with her too. Their apartment became our hangout spot, like in the Friends tv show. I was always at their place, Jack not as much, we had sleepovers all the time and we were basically together 24/7. I was even starting to become close with their family, we visited their grandma together and I talked to their mom from time to time, called their aunt my aunt and their uncle my uncle. Everything was great, they even got two cats and they were their moms and I was their aunt.

Anyway, I always had family issues so I got a job pretty fast after starting college so I could separate myself from them. At my current job I met my boyfriend. It took me a long time to realize I was into him because he is 20 years older than me and it never even crossed my mind I could ever be into someone who is almost my fathers age. To make the story short we are not coworkers anymore, but we are together and I am very happy with him. He's treating me like a woman should be treated and showed me what love is supposed to be. I have never felt more loved and secure in a relationship.

When we first got together I of course told Molly first. For a while I was dropping hints here and there and she quickly picked up on it. Her sister on the other hand realized what was going on even before I did, making jokes about the two of us before the thought of him that way even crossed my mind, never did she do it in a negative way. Molly didn't take it very well at first, she found it disgusting and couldn't accept it as reality. Jack shared his negative opinion very openly, repeating the fact that he is older and kept being persistent on how he couldn't believe I could do such a disgusting thing (he hooked up with a 60yr old married man from grindr when he was 17/18 in a random hotel so I told him he had like no say in that because he did worse than me). Kate on the other hand was the only one defending me, saying she's not all for it but that it's my life and that even tho it's unusual it's not such a rare thing to happen and gave their grandma as an example (her husband was also 20yrs older). I didn't tell them much about him because whenever I tried I was only being cut off by extremely negative comments and i wanted to enjoy that good thing that was happening to me. After a few weeks they seemed to have chilled out and I started talking to Molly about it.

On the day it all happened I was working a morning shift after which I was going to my bfs place. In the middle of the shift I get a call from Molly to come over to their place after work cause Jack was coming and Kate was home and they were gonna play cards (like we always do). I refused because I already had plans, no big deal right? Well next thing I know I get a text from her sister Kate and Kate tells me in a sweet manner that they all want to see me and talk to me about the whole situation, basically to have an intervention. Again, no big deal, we were extremely close and had interventions with each other (like in How I Met Your Mother) whenever something was up. But, instead of just making plans for that to take place, we started talking about it and things got heated up real fast. She started saying how I've become a lowlife, how I've hit rock bottom, how I've become such a negative person, how the whole thing is disgusting and I'm a lost cause and she doesn't want to be around that profile of people and that they all sat down, talked about me and came to a conclusion that they are bothered by the same things and all agree (now remember, she's talking about my boyfriend, saying a lot of heavy insults). I have to point out that since then absolutely nothing has changed but them constantly talking about it and me not being in an amazing mood because I was listening extremely bad stuff about a man who was now my bf from people i cared most about. I kept my cool the whole time and the only thing I said that could've been an insult to her was that she was two faced in this situation because the last time she saw me she was defending me in front of everyone and now she was throwing around hideous insults. We ended the convo on bad terms.

Molly and I talked the next day and new information was presented to me: Jack was insulted by the fact I brought up the hotel thing and it hurt him deeply, they were triggered by me always being tired (I spend 3+ hours in public transportation to get to and from work every single day while I'm maintaining my apartment and social life after work in a fast paced environment while recovering from anxiety) and taking my medications (for the said anxiety disorder that made no sense cause I just started having extreme of the extremes panic attacks and they saw it happening and went through it all with me + Jack was taking the same meds for two years first for depression then for a personality disorder but him taking it was fine and me it's unacceptable), and some things I did in the past (going out like college kids do and drinking but not getting involved in crazy shit and making a fool out of myself just clubbing and talking to guys like bro talking stage when you meet someone and talk to them to get to know each other so you can see if you wanna date). When I pointed out the obvious, longer versions of the stuff I put in brackets, Molly agreed with me and said that I didn't change as a person or ever did anything against my morals or how I represent myself as a person.

Jack disappeared off the face of Earth for me, again. He has been doing that for months before the whole thing happened for a thing that happened a year ago and that we talked over multiple times and both agreed it was behind us. Because he was already ghosting me before, pretending we're all normal when we see each other, I didn't reach out. Three months later he reached out because Molly told him to. He attacked me of being homophobic (unrelated and untrue, I was the first one he confided in and have been one of his biggest supports, never once did I say something that resembled being homophobic, which can be confirmed by my other friends who are not straight), mentally unstable (for a while yes but not in a way he was presenting it, I was burned out because I was working full time while having severe panic attacks 10+ times a day. nobody ever noticed because I had learned to live and function normally while having extreme attacks like feeling like the earth is gonna open up and swallow me extreme. every time id start to shake id go to the restroom take my pill as perscribed and got back to work if it came to that, plus i was regularly attending college classes and was passing all of my exams. nobody ever noticed unless i told them what was up; plus he was also struggling with mental health in a different way where i was his support any time of the day or night for anything ever needed because unlike me unfortunately he couldn't be actively functional while being disfuctional which had consequences on his freshman year of college), anything i said he said were my tried to be manipulative to get myself out of that situation and that in the past they let me do those things (live my life like a normal person?) and kept hanging out with me because they felt sorry for me because of the shit that happened to me in my life. That only showed me he couldn't stand me and only waited for some shit to come up so he could do that. Then he called me a liar and blocked me on everything.

After that I got a call from Kate, accusing me of talking shit about her, which did not happen and I had no contact with her either for months. She threw some more insults my way, even said I ""sold myself for a roof over my head and a piece of bread"". I literally have my own job and my own apartment to live at and that was so random and unrelated and just pure nonsense. After that I ended the conversation.

They couldn't understand why I take naps after work, why I was tired all the time, they said I hop from men to men (I had 3 boyfriends my whole life, first one being maybe 2 years ago and the second was a short rebound relationship, third being my current boyfriend), that I had no respect for myself because of that and that I am destroying myself as a woman.

Some time later I saw Molly for a cup of coffee after 2 months of not seeing each other because first she went home for a month and then I was sick for a month, didnt even go to work, couldn't leave the bed. That day her sister Kate called from Mollys phone apologizing but never ended up unblocking me. Right after that Molly called me and invited me for a sleepover and I refused for obvious reasons, saying I'm going to my bfs place hoping the real reason is pretty clear. That did not sit right with them.

Molly even admitted she wanted to cut me off too even tho we agreed we were fine but that she didn't because a friend of ours reminded her what a good friend I've been to her during all these years. Somebody else had to remind her that I was there for her day and night with whatever she needed, anything, anytime, I always went out of my for her including calling in sick to leave the country when she needed me somewhere else and getting on a bus the same hour. I gave my all to those people and I've only realized that our friendship was way more important to me than to them and that they wouldn't give their all for me or even go out of their way for me like I did for them, every single day.

It obviously wasn't about me being with my boyfriend, a man who takes care of me the same way I take care of him, a man who gives his all, an honest and hardworking man who gave me nothing but love, care, support and who made my life better.

We’re in the process of opening a specialty coffee shop in Texas and are trying to build out our daily projections.

We’d love to hear from anyone who has experience running or working in a coffee shop.. How many cups per day does your location usually serve? What’s typical on weekdays vs weekends?

We’re especially curious about:

- Daily average cup count (and how it changes with season or location)

- If you saw a ramp-up period after opening (and how long it took)
	•	What kind of shop you’re running (e.g. high-volume drive-thru, neighborhood café, cocktail hybrid, etc.)

Any insights are appreciated! This info would really help us forecast realistically and avoid over/underestimating our traffic.

Thanks in advance ☕

It all started a little before college started when I was 18 and started having constant nausea, sharp pains, and constipation. We went to the doctors office and he sent me to the ER because they though I was having an appendicitis. They found nothing and said I have excessive stomach acid and prescribed me omeprazole and said it was all just from stress. That worked for about a week then when my prescription was out I started to feel bad once again. We went down the whole GI route because that was my main symptom at the time, and found nothing. I even took Prozac because I thought maybe it was all from anxiety. One weekend I felt so bad that I went to urgent care where they tested my thyroid levels and found my thyroglobulin antibodies were high (about 80 and the range was 0-4).  After that we went to the endocrinologist where they did nothing and told me I didn't have Hashimoto's. After this we kept looking for answers and finally they saw my gallbladder was not properly working so they took it out. These helped some of my symptoms for about 3-4 months but after that I started to get more symptoms, the main one being GI problems (nausea, heartburn, bloating). I went on famotidine 40mg morning and night and have currently been taking that for maybe 10-12 months which I have heard is not good to do. We have tried so many thing including cutting things from my diet (soy, dairy, and currently gluten) though they were never all at the same time. Added a magnesium supplement which has helped a little bit. Did allergy testing. I have tried levothyroxine, and NP thyroid and both of those helped for a little until they eventually make my symptoms worse. And now I just got a redo of my thyroid panel and all my levels seem normal. (Reverse T3 is at 21 on a 8-25 scale which could maybe be the reason for my symptoms?) My current symptoms are extreme fatigue, nausea, acid reflux, bloating / loss of appetite, and shortness of breath. If it matters I drink coffee (every morning), smoke weed (3-5 times per week), and drink alcohol (rarely) but I don't think any of those are really hurting me. Currently taking famotidine 40mg day and night and magnesium at night. Does any one maybe have any suggestions for what I should do? I can provide any extra details if needed these were just the things I could remember. Also I do have a very good doctor who is willing to help but even he seems a bit stumped.",1,1751325281.0,Hashimotos,0,1.0,False

Got up at 5 AM today, which gave me enough time to get the brain juices flowing — a little coffee, some water, and just enough peace to feel like a functioning human.
I mowed the yard too, which always hits me with that grown-up feeling. There’s just something about pushing that mower for an hour that paints the bigger picture: the “worst” part of my week is an hour in the sun, sweating it out on my own property, while so many people are stressing about everything under the sun. That thought alone makes me feel stupidly happy and proud.

Users vs. Rocks

First ticket today? 100% stupid. I swear, some users make me wonder how they even manage to drive to work without accidentally launching themselves into space. It’s like the moment they see a menu, they panic-click past it like it’s an alien language — then act confused when I ask the simplest question.
At least rocks are predictable. People? Not so much.

A Ticket Worth Doing

Second ticket was a breath of fresh air. Had a user who couldn’t sign into Google because she was stuck using her personal Gmail instead of the company account. Easy fix, got her squared away, and it was actually satisfying — no rock comparisons needed.

My Chrome Extension Baby

I’m extra proud today because I got my co-worker to test my new Chrome extension. It’s just a simple script that clears out all the junk data from the browser. I made it because we’ve got these rock-smart users, so now it’s just three clicks, all in the same spot. No more wandering through settings like lost cave people. Should help with Five9, Chrome, Engage, and Athena issues — more brain cells for everyone!

Citrix, But Make It Exclusive

Turns out I’m the only one on the team who’s touched the Elevance Citrix environment. Not because I’m some Citrix wizard — I just ended up solving this weird ticket a few months ago that nobody wanted to touch. Now when the questions come up, I’m the guy with answers. I’ll take it.

Bring On the Next Ticket Mountain

We’ve got a big shift coming — soon we’ll start handling tickets for other parts of the company. I’m pumped about this. More tickets means more programs to learn, more weird issues to solve, and maybe I’ll find ways to automate their side too. If I can keep building tools and making life easier for everyone, that’s another gold star on the resume.


---

Perspective Check

Not every day is perfect, but the big picture is solid. I’m living a low-stress life, pushing my mower, building my scripts, and getting my name out there. Missouri’s still calling my name — and if the worst part about moving there is the weather, I’ll just build a bigger porch.

At the end of the day: I’m happy, the grass is cut, the rocks are confused, and I’m exactly where I want to be.

Okay, Reddit fam, I gotta share this thing that's been seriously simplifying my life lately. I was so over hauling around my massive purse, you know, the one that feels like you're carrying bricks? I needed something cute, practical, and that wouldn't leave me with a permanent shoulder ache. After what felt like forever searching, I stumbled upon this quilted mini backpack sling bag, and honestly, I'm hooked.

I used to be *that* person, digging through a bottomless tote bag, desperately searching for my keys while trying to juggle a coffee. Or even worse, shoving my phone in my back pocket, just praying it wouldn't fall out when I sat down. The struggle was real! But this little bag? It’s like a stylish, compact, Mary Poppins bag. Seriously.

First off, the size is just right. It's big enough to fit my phone, wallet, keys, a small makeup bag (gotta have the essentials!), and even a portable charger. But it's not so big that I'm tempted to stuff it with a bunch of unnecessary stuff I don't need. Plus, it's seriously lightweight, which is a major win when you're walking around all day. No more shoulder pain! 🙌

The quilted design is what initially caught my eye. It's super cute and adds a little something extra to any outfit. I've already gotten so many compliments on it! And the adjustable strap is a lifesaver. I can wear it as a crossbody bag or sling it over one shoulder, depending on what I'm feeling. Quick and easy access to my stuff is a major plus.

One thing I was a little worried about was security. I’ve had a few close calls with things almost falling out of my old bags, but this mini backpack has a secure closure, so I don’t have to worry about losing anything. Peace of mind is priceless, right?

I recently took it to a music festival, and it was a total lifesaver. I was able to carry all my essentials without feeling weighed down or uncomfortable. I even had room for a small water bottle! Seriously, it was the perfect festival companion. I was able to dance and move around freely without worrying about my bag getting in the way.

I found mine on ursupermart.com, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality for the price. I was a little hesitant at first because I hadn’t heard of the site before, but the reviews were good, and I figured I’d give it a shot. I’m so glad I did!

I know some of you might be thinking, ""Another bag? Do I really need it?"" And honestly, maybe you don't. But if you're anything like me and you're tired of lugging around a bulky bag or constantly worrying about your belongings, this mini backpack is definitely worth considering.

It’s not just about the style, though that’s a big part of it. It’s about the convenience, the comfort, and the peace of mind. It’s about having a bag that’s both fashionable and functional, so you can focus on enjoying your day without feeling weighed down.

I’ve tried other sling bags and mini backpacks before, but this one is different. The quilted design sets it apart, and the size is just perfect for my needs. It’s not too big, not too small, but just right. It’s like the Goldilocks of bags! 🐻🐻🐻

I also love that it’s versatile. I can wear it with jeans and a t-shirt for a casual look, or dress it up with a skirt and a blouse. It goes with everything! And because it's durable, I know I won't have to replace it anytime soon, which saves me money in the long run.

I was looking for a fashionable sling bag for women and this one just stood out because of the olive green color. I have been using it for everyday use and it has been great.

1lomb57,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildinpublic/comments/1lomb57/after_weeks_of_procrastinating_i_finally_got_my/,After weeks of procrastinating I finally got my Mac App approved by Apple,"I've been doing web development for over a decade. I love the craft, I love shipping, and I’ve made peace with JavaScript's weirdness. So when I decided to build a Mac app, I figured, how bad could it be?

Spoiler: bad.

Turns out, before your lovingly crafted binary can be double-clicked by anyone outside your immediate bloodline, it needs to be notarized by Apple. And that process... is something else.

Step 1: Prove you exist
First, I had to create a developer account. Simple enough, right? Wrong.

The account creation process was an obstacle course of broken forms, unhelpful error messages, and support emails that took 3~7 business days to answer. I’m a solo developer, operating under a registered company in my own name, but Apple still made me jump through a series of hoops to prove that I was, in fact, affiliated with myself.

At one point I found myself crafting fake paperwork and digitally ""stamping"" things like I was running a fake passport operation, all to convince Apple that yes, the person listed on the legal documents is the same person applying to the program.

After enough bureaucracy to qualify for a small government grant, I was finally allowed to pay the $99/year fee for the honor of letting users open an app they already paid for. What a deal.

Step 2: Figuring out notarization
With the account set up, I moved on to code signing and notarization. The best resource I found for signing Electron apps was a YouTube video from a generous developer with an accent thick enough that I had to turn on subtitles. (If you're reading this: you're a hero.)

After following the steps and submitting my app for notarization, I expected to wait the 10 minutes Apple claims it usually takes. One hour passed. Then six. Then twelve. Somewhere around the 36-hour mark, I started to wonder if this was a normal delay or if I had accidentally submitted my binary to the void.

Just as I was drafting a support ticket (and mentally preparing for another round of email ping-pong), I checked one last time, and saw it: ""Approved"".

I don’t remember the last time I felt that much relief from a status message.

Conclusion: Apple doesn't give a damn about devs
Shipping a Mac app in 2025 is technically possible, but it’s not fun. It feels less like building software and more like navigating a maze of bureaucracy with cryptographic side quests.

Once everything is set up, notarization isn't too bad. But the first time through? Expect friction. Expect confusion. Expect to Google things like ""codesign not working why"".

Would I recommend it? Sure, if you really need to ship a Mac app. Just maybe clear your schedule and stock up on patience (and coffee).",2,1751325178.0,buildinpublic,1,1.0,False

When we’re setting up for events though he’ll help me out with things that I don’t really need help with and get pretty close to me, for example we were told to put something up on the wall, while I was putting in a thumb tack he was holding up the thing for me where his hands were basically on top of mine even though it was very light and I could’ve easily done it myself. That kind of thing has happened on a number of occasions and he also often ends up holding doors for me or letting me walk first is which I don’t see him doing for other people, and bringing up things mildly related to how he would be in a relationship or like childhood crushes, romance, etc. only problem is the fact that like I mentioned before he hasn’t asked for my number or to hang out and sometimes if were left alone for some time without a task he kinda just gets up and leaves the room or doesn’t say anything and it gets really awkward, a possible reason could be because I know he hasn’t really been in a relationship before or because while we’re both teenagers he’s almost 18 and I’m a bit younger.
