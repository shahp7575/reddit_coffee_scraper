There was a WhatsApp group of Hindi- Marathi language exam  in which i added. I Already passed it, but i didn't left the group. I girl named as manish(39F) text anybody have to application of hindi language exam, plz send it.

I sent to her & i asked her when did u joined u r job( all the government employees need to give language exam within 3 yrs if they don't have in 10th / 12th) she told me its been 1 year.

Me: what u work?
She: cleark at jalgaon city.
Me : can we talk on call
She: yes sure, i will ping u at evening.
Me : okay Np.
 
After 15 min of conversation i started to flirt with her bcz her talk was so positive & awesome.

Me: what's u r age 
She: u should not ask age to girls
Me: u r voice says it u r mature.
She: yeah am enough mature.
Me:  u born & brought up where?
She: Aurangabad 
Me: same place wow.

Me: When u will come here
She: tmwr am planning to come
Me: can we meet for coffee 
She : yeah, why not.

( My talk & flirty lines gave so much hint to her that i willing to hang out with her )

At evening 7 pm she came to aurangabad 
I picked her at bus stop & i told her that we will go to a cafe

She is physically chubby girl & very hot & great boobs, height is around 5.2  & weight around 60 kg.
Fair with face with good makeup & lipstick. 

She sat on my bike & initially its became hard for me to start flirt. But i asked her how do u felt by sitting on my bike. She said nothing special its normal.

Once we reach there i ordered coffee for us 

The cafe was like compartments & good privacy.

I asked her why u not married yet, u look 29 yr old.
She said i didn't married bcz i didn't got a guy of my choice & I'm not 29, more older than that.
I asked her no u look 29. Whats u r actual age she said 39, i got shock u look so young.

I came to know that she is unmarried & 39 so might she have too much physical attraction. So i asked her, what u think abt me. She said u r too young for me.

I said am Young but very fine to satisfy u. 
She gave me a smile

I started to take her hand in my hand. We are sitting at side of each other & very private place so i moved bit more closed & i kissed her on her chicks. She responded positively. 

I even kissed her on her lips. She was denying fake. But when my lips touches her lips she do kiss me at very hot waysex

I even took her top up, & pressed her boobs. 
I sucked her big boobs & nipples. 
She was denying very fake but actually she needed it. 

This is our first time & for her self showing that she is good girl so she doing very fake denying but actually she permitting me to everything.  

I asked her to Change the place let me sit at her place. I sat inside & asked her to suck my dick. She denied 3-4 times but finally she took it inside her mouth & started to suck vigorously.
I felt so nice & hot. Later i insert my hand in her leggings & inserted 2 fingers. 
I wish to fuck her there only but problem is the compartment is small so  we didn't had sex.

She said me it was my fast today & u made me to suck u r dick. 
Nearly 35-40 min we spend at cafe & we left it. I droped her near to her area & she said i will block u now. 

Reality : 
 Being unmarried at 39 she have sex needs. But being a girl its hard for her to ask it & do it even at first meet. What  the next person will think. So she showing me that she don't need it & am doing force to her. But the reality is she was too horney for it

But she did kiss, blowjob & gave me her boobs to suck & we enjoyed.

Thank u!!!!

i have been working alongside my cousin on starting a small coffee cart that also sells vinyl. we are just  trying to figure out the **b**est spots around town to set up — places with foot traffic, people hanging out, or events where this kind of thing would make sense. 

if you’ve seen other vendors doing something similar, or you know spots that tend to be friendly to small pop-ups, let us know! we've considered parks or public areas with good foot traffic, college campuses, farmer’s markets, art fairs, weekend events, busy corners for early morning coffee drinkers, etc. let us know if there is any places we can't miss. 

if anyone knows if there are any permits, rules, or what the city actually enforces/don’t worry too much about type info, that would help a ton too.

1ox0rde,https://www.reddit.com/r/LondonLionesses/comments/1ox0rde/vs_aston_villa_this_sunday_across_the_water/,"Vs. Aston Villa This Sunday - (& Across the Water, Another Spirit Playoff Match)","Some here may not know that I live in the Washington DC area (Virginia suburbs) & am a die hard Washington Spirit (& Michele Kang) fan (season ticket holder).  Being a Michele Kang fan has led me to becoming a 'big' fan of the LCL's from afar.  If I was a London resident, I'd be a London City Lionesses season ticket holder myself.

I get up early on LCL's match days, get my coffee & settle in, usually around 7:00 AM my time, to watch the LCL's matches.  Love the team, & the squad members.  Really excited for them.

Which brings me to this match this weekend.  I will be getting my coffee & watching what seems like will be a very competitive hard fought match against a solid Aston Villa squad.  They put up a good fight versus United.  How did Taylor's strike get through all those bodies, I do not know, but it did.  Even so, the Claret & Blue had good shape on offensive tallies posing a threat to score at other times.  However, what really impressed me is how Villa held United scoreless for the remainder of the match (55+').  It will take our LCL's better play, shape & build up to find the openings needed to get past their solid defense & keeper, D'Angelo.  Here's where I'm hoping for a sweet connection between say Freya & Izzy.  Maybe a loose ball in the box that Niki puts in the back of the net.  This feels like it will be a tough match Sunday, but one we can come away with 3 points if we play like we're capable of.  Because that's what it may take to get over the Villa.

Now, what a weekend this will be for me.

(Washington Spirit) ...First, Saturday, Nov. 15, 12:00 Noon my time (5:00 PM yours) I'll be in 'sold out' Audi Field (stadium) with 20,200 other Spirit fans cheering on our squad in an ever so crucial semi-final match vs. a very good Portland Thorns (as in Rose thorns, Portland is known as the city of Roses).  We're so close to moving on to our NWSL 'championship' match, if we can win this on Saturday.  The intensity in the stadium will live up to it's reputation as 'Rowdy Audi' Field.  I am a nervous wreck & it's still the day before.  I'm excited too though, so looking forward to the feeling you have in our packed sold out stadium cheering on our squad.

(London City Lionesses) ...But then, hopefully after a day watching our Spirit Squad advance to the championship match, ...I will be getting my coffee early Sunday morning tuning into what I think is another important match for LCL's vs. an Aston Villa squad that will present a difficult, tough match for us.  Sabrina D'Angelo is no slouch.  It is going to take some good play & maintaining shape & spaces with build up leading to connections in the final third to put it past their solid defense & keeper. Patience, possession, maintain shape, find the spaces.  I am so looking forward to this match as well.  What a great weekend of women's football for me. Hope it ends with two back-to-back victories.

Tune in on Saturday (5:00 PM your time) for our Spirit play-off semi-final match vs. the Portland Thorns.  It will be a war on the pitch. A match worth watching. We're dealing with a few key injuries & it will be interesting to see who is available. But Trinity Rodman should be back for us & she can be a dynamic game changer when her game is 'on.'

Then I'll be with you all Sunday morning (my time) cheering on our Lionesses vs. the Villa.

She  30F had a conflict with the executive manager, 46.
 Fortunarely none of us were reporting to him because we worked from 2 different companies. We were basically offering services to them. 
He talked down to her over a call, raised his voice at her, implied she is not smart enough because she didnt understand something he was saying.
He was a jerk, mean, arrogant, narcissist. 
 That was their only interraction.

She didnt go to HR. She was scared. She did ask him to stop raising his voice but he didn't stop. I was surprised of her courage. I doubt someone ever stepped up to him. 
But she did go to the headquarters to talk with the head of our department. He needed witnesses. I was new, it was my dream job. But i was on her side.
She left anyway because the guy got a warning but nothing else. I remained in the company but when the first reorganisation happened I was fired together with many others.
The conflict happened in January, she left in April. She had a weird phase in which she tried to impress him with her work after the incident. Worked overtime almost every day.

  I left in June. And one day I invited her for a coffee. We were good friends. And she confessed to me that she slept with him in September. They randomly met at the bar and discussed over a drink what happened.

Anyway, I feel like the biggest idot. I wanted to tell her about my feelings for her. I didnt want to do that while being coworkers. ",1,1763136766.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

I approached her at a coffee shop and we hit it off. 

On our most recent date, she came over to mine and I cooked for her. When we were having dinner, we had some deeper conversations about our childhood and traumas we experienced. Hers were a lot for me to process. She's uncomfortable by physical affection and intimacy, and based on her childhood experiences it makes sense. 

But I feel safe around her, and she feels safe around me. We kiss regularly and cuddle together and it feels very nice. When we cuddle sometimes I kiss her forehead and sometimes she kisses mine. It feels very romantic. She wants to wait until love to have sex. 

Despite this, I still get mixed signals from her. For example, she can go multiple days without texting me back, unless we are organizing a date, then she is very fast to respond. But otherwise, it is either no response, or very short and to the point texts. 

Additionally, a couple dates ago she mentioned she doesn't want to lead me on, and that she is unsure how she feels about me. I have made it clear to her that I like her and can see something serious between us, but she indicated she's unsure. The way I interpret that is she might be avoidant and is scared to lean in to her feelings towards me in case she gets heartbroken. 

I will continue seeing her, but I do worry in the back of my mind that she isn't interested. She's an extremely extroverted person and apparently has many dozens of friends, which I have yet to meet.

The diagnosis was based on estimated fetal weight, which combines measurements of the baby’s head, abdomen, and femur. In my case, the head and abdomen measurements were normal, but the femur was measuring really short (<1st percentile) and brought the estimated fetal weight down to the 9th percentile. The cutoff for an FGR diagnosis is the 10th percentile. 

In practical terms, the diagnosis meant that I needed twice-weekly fetal monitoring, including non-stress tests and dopplers. It also meant that if we were still in the 10th percentile or below at 36 weeks, they would recommend induction no later than 39 weeks, which I really wanted to avoid. 

I fully panicked and was picturing my baby having T. Rex arms and dachshund legs. I was convinced I somehow stunted his growth by having a single cup of coffee every morning. I doubled my protein intake (also doubled my acid reflux), hoping some of it would make its way to baby’s tiny limbs (please note I don’t think there’s any evidence this would work). 

Fast forward to today’s 36-week scan, and we’re in the 32nd percentile and no longer considered growth restricted. The doctor thinks they didn’t capture the full femur at the 32-week scan. Oops!

TLDR there is a lot of error baked into fetal measurement by ultrasound. If you get a diagnosis of FGR, especially if the head and abdomen measurements look normal, don’t be like me and don’t panic. ",1,1763136450.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

Once again, I can’t believe **Pick of the Day** was the only miss the Picks lineup had. Overall, we finished **profitable**, but I might need to **rethink how I structure the free post** — I’ll spin on that idea and get back to you ☺️☕️

Props went **2/5**, but I was *stoked* to see TreVeyon Henderson hit 2+ TDs for that juicy +260 payout! My only regret? Not taking him for 3+ 🤣 (kidding… sort of).

With Pick of the Day in a little slump and **Black Friday** around the corner, I’m considering an **epic sale** so free-tier & Reddit friends can comfortably jump into the full slate of plays. I love Pick of the Day when it’s on a heater, but it’s nice to have other options when it’s on ice 🥶

 

Alright friends, that's all for last night's review. I'll have today's picks out shortly!

I love the authenticity, I don't have to put on a fake persona, so I come cap in hand with my truth.

Another startup, I've been at this one for a while, a ton of iterations and failures but this one is close to my heart. I'm trying to channel a little childhood abandonment trauma into something useful. Sort of like Batman minus the billions, gadgets and vigilante beatings.. **My gut and data both say its the right time plus** the urge that won't die so hey.

Looking around, the world's a fucking mess right now:

Silicon Valley can't fix homelessness in their own backyard but wants to ""change the world""

Gen Z and alpha's future looks bleak as hell and they kinda know it.

Power and resources keep centralizing to the same handful of people

War is looking inevitable. I'm not even sure who were supposed to be fighting, is it the Russians, Chinese, Aliens or ourselves.

Then there AI, we'll get into that at some point.

But hey, we'll ""own nothing and be happy"" apparently

My favourite quote of all time and a statement that sums it all up is Dr. E.O. Wilson's:

# ""The real problem of humanity is we have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like technology.""

It's perfect as it just sums the whole shitfest up. We're out of balance.

2. **If you don't set a destination you wont know where your going.**

I've just learned this term ""narcissistic collapse"" and watched a video about how narcissists grieve their collapse and I can not believe this guy is describing what happened to me.

I am not diagnosed with anything since I have only ever been to one therapy session my whole life but I read a lot and introspect deeply. I have always suspected I might be a narcissist and have mentioned it to people on occasion to guage reaction I suppose. 

Either way an event occured in my life about 3 years ago that completely destroyed me as a person. Total social collapse, betrayal, shame, guilt, hopelessness. I receded from reality and became catatonic for weeks. I could not function as a human being, I would cry constantly, grieving everything; my identity had been destroyed in a huge public fireball and I was left a shell of a person, unable to get out of bed.

I have come to learn that this is textbook narcissistic collapse and I have been in a slow and painful recovery ever since.

I will spare you all the gory details of the events but I would like to share a bit about my recovery journey since then.

Social Humiliation - Dissolution
---------------------------------------------------
In my mind, I had been abandoned by everyone that I loved. Hardly anybody called and those that did were met with disaster. I am already guilty of not keeping in touch with many people but now I spoke to no-one. The events were too raw. I felt like I could not trust anyone and that nobody could trust me either. I felt like I didn't even know who I was anymore. 

I left my old friendship plants to die over the next few years.

Rebuilding The Fake Self
-----------------------------------------
I almost forgot about this phase because looking back it actually happend super quickly. Within 6 months, I had ""bounced back"". I got a super high paying job, I got into a new relationship, she moved in super quick. 

Little did I know that I was not at all over anything and that it was all just waiting 1 inch below the surface of my facade.

The next year and a half I spent working my ass off at my job to the point of burnout. I was amassing some money which was great because I would need it for what comes next. I made a whole new circle of friends where I sat at the center, hosting parties and BBQs every weekend. Drinking, drugs, sex, going out, super socially active. I convinced myself that I was okay and I had the life to prove it.

In reality my relationship was chaotic as hell. We're both big characters with tremendous egos, we went travelling which was really difficult. She is socially quite controlling and manipulative, taking opportunities to publicly embarrass me with an argument, rubbing salt into raw wounds regularly. 

For some reason, neither of us have left this relationship. She is sometimes so raw and unfiltered that I have learned deep things about myself through her lense. 

At some point during our relationship we were having an argument, and I said to her 
"" I don't care what people think about me"", to which she responded ""Yes you do. You care a lot about what people think about you"".

This statement got caught in my mind. 

Suddenly, a truth had been spoken that once again shattered my sense of self. Something which I had wholeheartedly believed to be true about myself was then not true. 

I did care what people thought about me. I had been meticulously creating and maintaining a false reality in which I did not care what people thought about me. In that way I can never really be hurt by anything someone says or does. 

Even though on the outside it was extremely obvious that I care what people think.

Criticisms were received painfully, sometimes I could not bring myself to read feedback.

With this statement my mind was broken anew. The brand new, successful, fake self I had created suddenly had another big hole in him. Gradually over the next few months I quit my job, and started smoking weed every single day. I kept working on bullshit pseudo-work-like projects from home to maintain some outward appearance of being productive but really, every day I began to rot.

My partner was having her own mental health crisis and together we were like a match in a petrol station. Months and months of super explosive arguments. I felt hurt, she felt hurt, over and over again. 

Our 1 redeeming quality was that we wanted to improve as people. We know that we're not good together, but we do accept each other for who we are and we have a desire to improve. 

So after our arguments (never fights, i do not allow myself to become violent, ever) we usually find a way to calm down and introspect with each other. We are as honest as we can be with ourselves and our feelings and I personally really try to learn as much as I can from these experiences.


Dissolution Round 2
---------------------------------

Over time I fell deep into to all kinds of addictions and high risk behaviours. Pornogpraphy, leverage trading (lost thousands - avoid at all costs), weed, video games, ""self improvement"", weight loss.

The leverage trading was really the next huge chaotic event in this saga. I lost thousands over night leverage trading with my hyperactive emotions. This loss served to crumble whatever was left of my fragile ego into a fine powder. The following 2 weeks were my first catatonic episode. I had stayed up for about 4-5 days straight with barely any sleep so once I had lost what I had to lose my mind and body needed rest. I lost about 4kg of weight as well during those few days of trading.

This is when I lost all executive function. I could no longer bring myself to do any small tasks anymore. Strangely enough about a month prior to this I hired my freakin parents with a salary to help me get more things done ( I was addicted to efficiency as well) but that had now turned into a necessity as I could no longer even bring myself to go outside and buy groceries. 

As this pattern continued I have learned a lot about myself. In my catatonic phases the only thing I could do for myself was listen to audio books. Luckily I found a few good ones and had saved enough money to allow myself to lounge around at home for as long as I wanted. The audio books were motivational or stoic and things like that. 

A lot of them didn't make any sense at all to me any more. I no longer believed that I could be trusted to hold a job. That actually seemed crazy and nightmarish. The thought of again being subjected to office politics made me feel numb inside.

I searched for things within myself that I could grab onto and hold to be true. 

- I am a good person. 
- I'm not responsible for everything that happened. 
- I want to help people.
- I want to get better.

I tested many other things as well but these are some that have stuck with me.

I read and listened to many things about consciousness, Buddhism, spirituality, ADHD (because I had executive dysfunction symptoms), world history, geo-politics. I was soul searching on a daily basis. I wanted to travel at first but I couldn't bring myself to do it. 

Lying in bed my old self had died again. I did not know what happened but I knew something was broken and that I had to rebuild it now. I had no self control. No solace from despair. 

I had distractions. 

Chess
----------

In the aftermath I got addicted to Chess as well as a way of retaining a modicum of control in my life. Luckily this was one of the only good things I had going on.

Since I no longer went out drinking with people anymore, my social interactions fell dramatically. I recognized that I need social interaction in my life and so as often as I can I go down to my local coffee shop and play chess with the owner (as well as online on my phone a lot).

The owner of the coffee shop is a good friend. Separate from my past. We both took an interest in chess at the same time and we played so much that we basically started a chess club. Multiple people got involved, now that I look at it, I guess I was constructing a new reality here as well. 

For months, almost daily I would go down and play chess and drink coffee. It's all I could do. My only respite. I went basically nowhere else if I could help it. I felt safe there with my friend. And at home, I had my cats. 

Chess became the first new part of my new identity. I still play often. In the coffee shop at first, because I was experiencing total nervous system shutdown, when I played chess I would physically shake.

The confrontational aspect and competitive nature of this board game and it's opponent would cause me to shake like a leaf in fear. Rationally, I knew that no harm could come to me in a game of chess but physically and emotionally I was terrified. Especially when playing with new people or people who were much better than me. I had to face that reality, constantly as I lost over and over again. 

It took months for the shaking to stop actually. Even now, sometimes occasionally it comes back. That's my fear, expressing itself. And sometimes we win.

Searching for the Self
------------------------------------

This is where I'm at now. I had about 1.5 years of runway until I ran out of money and had to find work, that's 3 years total from the first big events. That's where I'm at now.

I've fallen all the way down from my high pedestal. I try to be as humble as I can. I took some work with my dad which has forced some interesting interactions and forces me into a better routine.

I'm still addicted to weed but I'm taking medication to help reduce the euphoric effects, gradually leading to reduction. 

I'm aware that there is a new identity being built and that I have a choice in how that forms.

My main focus is on awareness of myself. Trying to observe my thoughts and feelings my feelings when they arise. If I notice that I am exploding or imploding and can just accept it, I find it easier to deal with.

Acceptance is actually feeling like a big part of it. Accepting the things I have done to people. Accepting the things that I do to myself. Forgiving myself, for things I have done in my past. 

When those things come up now, I feel them. Right now, as I write this, the feeling is in my stomach. My body points something out and I try to feel it and let it go. 

Sometimes there is a memory attached. A painful memory in which I feel blame or anger or pity or some other awful emotions. I try to feel them in my body. If I catch myself ruminating too much I try to bring myself back to the present and just be in the moment. If I get to the root of something and I notice that I am judging myself or someone else too harshly I try to forgive and sometimes, the weight is lifted. 

I speak regularly with people about my mental health. I've decided to just be honest to people about it because it's far too confusing to lie about and there was no way I could hide it anymore. Emotions just poured out of me whenever they want. Except love. I found that very very difficult to express for a long time.

Even now I'm not all the way there yet.

I'm just trying to get a few small wins. Complete a job. Quit smoking weed (work in progress). Be aware and forgive myself and others. Avoid compulsive behaviours. Do good things for myself or others when I am aware. Be nicer to my partner. Keep learning, reading and playing chess within reason. Search for intrinsic, internal motivations.

I feel like I no longer idolise success as much as I used to. I've had to come to terms with failure and accept it as a part of me. I don't know what my future self will be like but I'm trying to act like a better person, not a more successful one.

All the best.

As a recap to my condition, I got covid in late 2020 and had worsening brain fog for a year while still being able to function normally. In late 2021 I had a massive crash where I was practically bed bound for three or four months until my baseline stabilized (I think due to starting LDN and Pacing). And I was at sort of a moderate stage for years after that. If you'd like to see my exact symptoms during this time I believe I have comments and posts from back then where I described it in detail, but it's hard to recall these years later exactly what I was feeling.

I was going through RN school at the time which was very difficult as I felt like absolute crap and I would get post exertional malaise very regularly throughout that time period.

Throughout that time and continuously I've been trying different medications and supplements and experimenting with what works and what doesn't. I've come up with a ""supplement stack"" that has improved my baseline functionality enough to consider myself almost mild.

Currently I work as an RN at a methadone clinic one to two days a week without seeing any post exertional malaise (most of the time). I'm going to preface discussing any medications and supplements with saying the single most important aspect of my improvement has been **pacing**. 

(Although there is some nuance to this as if I sat down and did absolutely nothing for five days in a row I would start to feel worse than if I would do one small activity like driving to the store or doing something small but keeping yourself under the post exertion malaise threshold is the most important aspect IMO.)

Here's my list of supplements I take daily with notes next to each one (this is not medical advice or recommendation this is what has worked for me)

List of prescribed medications (daily dose):

\-4.5mg naltrexone (Immune modulating effects, at night. One of the first things I tried and is  extremely helpful, if not the most helpful medication I take. I've been taking it for 4 years+)

\-2mg Guanfacine (neurological deficits, )

List of supplements (daily dose):

\-20g D-Ribose powder (metabolic energy production, 10G in the morning 10G at night)

\-1200mg N-ACETYL CYSTEINE or “NAC” (Used with guanfacine for neurological deficits)

\-2000mg Acetyl-L-Carnitine (metabolic energy production)

\-400mg Coenzyme Q10 or “CoQ10” (metabolic energy production)

\-200/6mg epicatechin and piperine (metabolic energy production) 

\-1000mg Oxaloacetate (metabolic energy production, I believe this has made a vast improvement in my baseline and overall how I feel daily I started taking this daily about a year ago and I believe it's what's it been allowing me to work without getting PEM. It is extremely expensive, but if I can make more money with it by being able to work I think its worth it) 

\-ceramide supplement active ingredient ceratiq 350mg (possible neuro enhancement still experimenting with this but hasn't seemed to be negative) 

I also have been gluten, dairy and seed oil free for \~4 years now, along with reducing added sugar and limiting high histamine foods like coffee. If you'd like any more details feel free to ask. I wish everyone good luck with this horrible illness.",2,1763135768.0,covidlonghaulers,0,0.75,False

Last week, I upgraded to the **Bezzera Sole Espresso Machine** from ADS Coffee Supplies ([here’s the link for anyone curious](https://ads-coffee-supplies.co.uk/product/bezzera-sole-1-group-traditional-espresso-coffee-machine/)). The excitement of unboxing something that feels genuinely *pro* was real—especially after years of wrestling with inconsistent shots and barely-there steam on my old kit.

# What’s stood out so far

Switching over from my previous single-boiler setup, the *Sole* has been a total game changer. Here are a few highlights from my first week:

* **Temperature stability:** I’m finally getting repeatable results shot-to-shot, which is something my old machine just couldn’t deliver.
* **Steaming power:** Microfoam for flat whites is suddenly actually possible—not just an aspirational YouTube thing.
* **Build quality:** The machine feels solid and purposeful, with proper heft to the portafilter and satisfying tactile switches. No more rattling or wobbly bits.
* There’s definitely a bit of a learning curve dialing in grind size and shot timing—my first couple of pulls were...let's say “experimental.”

ADS Coffee Supplies came recommended by a mate who’d bought grinders from them before. I was juggling options between a couple of similar machines (I nearly went for a heat exchanger model), but their comparison tools made it easy to see side-by-side differences in boiler types and dimensions. When I emailed about whether this would suit my usual flat whites *and* occasional americanos, their reply was refreshingly straight: no hard sell, just breaking down what might fit my kitchen space and workflow best.

# Delivery & after-sales

The delivery was quicker than expected—just a couple of days door-to-door. Packaging was absolutely bombproof (small pallet, everything held tight), which eased some nerves about spending so much on something fragile. They included clear warranty info in the box, plus details on how to get support if needed—makes you feel like you’re not left hanging once they’ve got your payment.

Mornings have honestly become something I look forward to more now—it’s weirdly satisfying watching that first shot stream in slow motion. If anyone else is wrestling with the upgrade itch, thought I’d share that my experience with ADS Coffee Supplies was genuinely positive.

I’m an expat (Latin American) living in the Netherlands and I’m seriously considering opening a small café in a medium-sized Dutch city — not Amsterdam. Think Gouda, Den Bosch, Delft, Leiden, Haarlem, Breda, etc.

Concept:
	•	Specialty coffee & tea
	•	Pastries + some savory options
	•	Whole cakes on order (birthdays, weddings, events — this is my background)

Something between a bakery-café, inspired by UK/US concepts.


Here’s where I’m confused:

I keep checking Funda Business and similar sites, and rents are often €2.000–€4.000/month for very small spaces, plus overname/takeover fees that range from €30k–€150k for inventory, goodwill, and “business value.”

ChatGPT calculated that to actually open the shop — equipment, permits, interior, initial stock, labor, buffer — I’d need around €150k–€250k realistically.

Now my question is:

How are small café owners paying these rents, taxes, insurance, staff, AND still surviving?
Is the business really sustaining these costs, or is there something I’m not understanding as a newcomer?

⸻

My doubts as a foreigner:
	•	I see SO MANY businesses close after 6–12 months.
	•	People here commonly open only 4–5 days per week and close at 17:00 — how are bills being paid!????
	•	Coffee in NL sells for ~€3–€4, pastries €3–€5. Margins are okay, but not huge.
	•	Labor, rent, taxes, insurances… it adds up fast.
	•	How do Dutch owners make the math work?
	•	Do the successful ones operate with huge loans? Personal savings? Lower rents negotiated off-platform? Are takeover fees always negotiable?

And also…

Are the prices I see on Funda Business realistic?
Or are they “optimistic,” and actual deals close for much less?
Should I be looking somewhere else instead?


Would love insight from:
	•	Café owners
	•	Bakers/pastry chefs
	•	Anyone who opened a horeca business in NL
	•	People familiar with rents outside the big cities
	•	Expats who tried and succeeded (or failed)


I’m very motivated to start something here, but I don’t want to throw my savings into a black hole without understanding the real economics behind Dutch cafés.

Thanks in advance! any honest advice or feedback is super welcome!

I'M NOT setting these builds based on main set rules for any specific classes, i just follow basic box dimension checker and 1 mm height, rest will be explained further below.

The intent of this post is showing my own experience playing mini 4wd especially with MA chassis with intention of sharing and learning, my own honest take, so feel free to comment and share some ideas.

You may see bunch a pictures here but it basically an idea that occurs to me which i want to try, now i'll separate this for some section by the pictures.

\- Pictures 1 - 9

I cut the body, thinking ""well there's gonna be ME chassis, what should i do about it?"", the idea occur to me is a vz setup.

Front : any stays would work, but i tested and prefer Fully, Super X, Multi Roller, since these 3 offers different roller placement, either wide or narrow, with Stick or SX underguard, i'm also used brakeplate it feel strong but a bit heavy.

Sides : AR plates i like it since it tends to be closer to the wheels

Rear : VZ build, but you may notice that i'm using Wide AR Rear stay as underguard instead of Super X Rear, Brakeplate, for rear roller setup i'm also tried using Wide Rear AR, Super X, which i would explain why later.

Gimmick : Front Sliding Damper, which i would place either at front or rear.

Wheels & Tires : Medium, Low Friction front, Super Hard / Hard Rear with 25.8 and 26 size.

NOTE : The old build had 136.5g, after cut 129.7g, + manta body 10.5g (cut + mesh), without batteries.

The Experience :

It's fun car, i was worried with the weight distribution after cutting the chassis, i've noticed the form of jumps still have problems (sometimes it's not straight if the car too fast), at first i tested with rigid front and rear, fast but a bit risky on turns or sharp corner but have a good grip for LC, the double bounces still exist, the setup is either wide or very narrow as you can see there's a build with ton of Super X, at front, rear, underguard for fun purpose, front used 12-13mm / 8-9mm while rear 19mm - 17mm - 13mm Rollers, with super narrow setup it's wild, it run fast, the jump is okay-ish? occasionally if it didn't make it, the car would jump to the other lane instead lol. this super narrow setup also have a habit to have veering off pose for every jump after turn which not that good ig, for stability i go for longer roller length and DAR 12-13mm front and 19mm rear, the problem if it's too fast it would fly off whe hitting turns.

The build with Sliding Gimmick, it can hold turns very well while the jumps are a bit good somehow, it depends on the springs that being use, for front i prefer soft, for rear i go hard (both depend on the tracks), the drawback is limited model of wide/narrow setup and roller length, i had fun with DAR 12-13mm at front and SX with 17mm rear instead, i saw lot of people don't bother put mass at front sliding damper since the setup already heavy, so i try it instead (i'll explain why later), i have huge problem with LC instead, i tried wide, soft rubber at front DAR, at high speed it barely hold at some tracks, but overall this build a bit balanced, i had fun with it but i felt the car slower somehow.

Overall for this build you can see from the picture how long the dad gum Roller length lol and i can make it shorter too by just put it at rear holes instead of the rear underguard stays holes, it's just pure fun to see it run like wild hot dog.

\- Pictures 10-15

HELP, the car refused to die after so many trials, so i turn it to open class model instead, ye olde classic front AT and rear Anchor.

Front : Hand made AT with 3° angle, i tried wide since most people using narrow, almost looks like tank setup with soft springs, plan to make rigid style with SX and AT narrow, i'm not interested with Pivot by how brittle it looks.

Hanging Lantern : just usual model with cut Super X, cut soft spring with intent to hold it down.

Rear : Hand made anchor system with very long setup, plan to use fully in the future, hard spring.

Wheels & Tires : LF front 25mm, rear SH 25.5mm / H 25mm, i'm not sure if i want to go 23.6mm-24mm, i plan to do it after this post.

NOTE : i make the front cut a bit deeper, weight with body + coin mass 139.8g without batteries.

The Experiences :

Absolute nightmare, need to focus a lot for cuts, making sure it straight when fitted with stays, a lot of patience for precision for holes and stay/plate position, as you can see the reason i cut a bit deep at the top and bottom of the front, to make the carbon stay would be next to the chassis directly, me thinks that would reinforce it and it bloody work for me, i mean this set already heavy, heavy = great impact, if it's off the course hitting something, which could break the car (look picture no. 9, something like that). With wide front, it affect jump which not smooth a bit, but i felt at turns it hold very well, no problem with LC either, since i could make the threaded shaft angle into 0° to 3°, the drawback is a bit higher roller height than normal simple cut at bottom of chassis, which could be adjusted by making new front stay instead.

(Bloody forgot the dad gum silly rear sliding lol), It just another goofy takes, to see if it's enough for front AT with Rear Rigid or Sliding Damper or not, which is not good enough especially on jump, it make the car a bit slower (Sliding), the remarkable one would be rigid rear setup since it would run well on some track which is really nice on straights, i run it with 17mm or 19mm rollers, stability wise are so-so.

The anchor is where mistakes happen, i sand the front part of rear stay a bit much, so the holes for the pre-drilled block mass + stays against it holes became too centered, making the stays to wobble instead of tight grip. By adjusting the chassis and base for brake plate by adding extra carbon i make the anchor work and stay alignment to be straight, the car looks long, by comparison with CFM at last 2 pictures.

Overall build is okay ig? for the runs, it could tackle most of tracks nicely, i won't say it fast enough, since i need to do more test, these AT and Anchor function well to do correction on tracks so i had no issue, the car crashed a lot, still alive and well, the roller setup is DAR 12-13mm front, 13mm rear, the roller length is long, it could expand almost at end of brake plate, you may notice i'm using rear damper, sometimes nothing at all, the form of the car while jumping is already nice, so i don't bother using custom catcher eventhough i had designed plates with holes for catcher, the setup can run ringless against LC which surprise me (with hdp tho), ngl it very rewarding and teach me a lot of stuff.

Misc stuff, explanation for a lot of stuff (mostly my own honest opinion) :

\- I'm gonna keep using this chassis for more tests until it broke apart into 3 Kingdoms, fun fact : i played the CFM and MA a lot, MA still holding on (ABS) while i swap CFM (Carbon) chassis 1 time lol.

\- Too many rules for some and different classes, so i can't be sure if these factors of my MA builds would adhere to the rules or guidelines, so count this as an open,  tbh i build these not for competition, just pure fun hobby, hence why 1mm height, fit the Dimension Checker is enough.

\- You may notice the roller angle are bit extreme on those pictures, yes it is, the higher the degree the more better the car when jumps in, but bad if there's no jump i.e Slopes/LC/Banks etc, you may see the front right roller a bit inward (using thick rubber) since i want to see what sort impact, which i notice it make the car slower and not very smooth sailing on tracks.

\- My takes on Rigid or Gimmick stays depends on what it does, rigid somehow good enough, especially on LC since you want the car to hold on, while Gimmicks good for either jump section, turn / curves, there's no perfect setup.

\- Rollers have different shape, either flat, rounded, cross mix mat (metal aluminium with rubber or plastic), i like flat since it has more friction which would help hold the car, i sand it roughly too, if it's hi-speed, plastic ring would be good instead, while i'm not fancy metal rounded, for roller height it depends on the track, i prefer lower at front and rear side, i'm not sure but if it's too tall, i felt the car slower and unbalanced on curves (for 3-lane), i need roller expert here if care to explain more.

\- The Front and Rear brake height would factor in jumps, the most easy is the front brake height would impact on how high the jump, the lower brake = lower jump, while rear would affect on how far you would jump, lower brake = shorter jump by combine those 2 factors it also affect the pose / position of the car at mid air, which preferably straight or a bit lean backwards a bit to ease off going back to the lane (if it's lean too forward there's chance it would bust your front underguard instead) imho, feel free to give your takes on this.

\- I'm making sure the gear shafts to be tight, the padding the gearbox to hold motor more tight, add padding on battery clip so it would have more grip, always making sure the chassis clean (wash it with soapy water), while dry clean the rest.

\- I don't break in rollers, wheels and gears, if i have to, i just run it with cleaner and oil for 30 minutes, did some test and i think just run it normally is fine.

\- The test i do on MA chassis on various track with mindset if it run smooth, make sure it run more wild and make it crash a lot, either make the weight light or very heavy sounds dumb but i'm just curious of the limit for the chassis (please don't try this) i did put mass dampers on sliding, which as you can see an impact the front of chassis basically gone lol, for run wise it's a bit nice stay on track well and have some good traction, not overall speed (heavy = slow).

\- Motor being used Mach Dash and Hyperdash, with 3.5 and 3.7, rarely using 4:1 since it feel slower somehow, i plan to make custom build of ultra dualshaft in the future (someone already did make it, thank god so i can learn it) or plasmadash.

\- Motor cap being cut so i can clean it, easy break ins, see the brush, easy contact cleaner (for the lord sake don't use WD-40) if necessary, since i play this as hobby and for fun sake, i changed brush because i'm not gonna bother buy a whole box to find the chosen one and repeat, if the commutator is dead, he's dead to me.

\- My breakins mostly simple, by run Low Battery (4 mins) - Rest (1 min) - Full Battery (2 mins) - Rest (3 mins) - Low (5 mins) - Rest (1 min) - High Voltage Full (3 mins), if it's too hot and fast it would eat the brush too much imho (wouldn't recommend this, better go to the full breakin method post instead).

\- Battery i mostly use is fujitsu pinks, sometimes an high cap mAh (since they are bit heavy), cheap off brand with characters of very light, low voltage but have constant charge, very low voltage or low mAh cap with high voltage.

\- Adequate amount of oil for bearings, grease for gears, springs and surface of moving parts is necessary if it's too much it would put more weight and run sluggish, small dollop, spread, clean excess.

\- Spacer on axle, the general offset for wheels, most use 1.5mm, but i'm using 3mm for stability on jumps and turns purpose, very nice on SH ngl, maybe bit slow on turns, noticeable with Hard tires.

\- The car made with bunch of Super X, re-purpose it for a lot stuff, no parts going to waste after the tomfoolery build.

\- I love using locking nuts tho it bit heavier since it would have firm grip, if using normal nuts i would give small dollop of super glue.

\- I'm using Hi Mount Tube for CFM and MA because it has balance characters, some want a stabilizer at high point, or a bit wide etc. for me the tube is just fine.

\- I give some slacks to the holes so it won't be too tight or loose for the screws.

\- I'm using Hi-Aero Mount wing on Mach Frame, put it on the hole and screw it with old carbon stay, it finish my panda mach frame lol.

\- I'm always checking the car on setting board before runs and take notes for it and sometimes purposely let it not straight to see what would happen, the result vary, sometimes the car made a full course with a bit crooked brake plates lol, won't take chance on guessing the factors and make some valid ideas, maybe just luck or only work on certain layout of track.

\- Ladies and gentleman, the double bounces still exist, wcyd, not ms flex, ms also could bounce but MA bounciness is just on different level, ain't gonna lie pure headache, with AT Front and Anchor somehow it's not that bad.

\- I'm not gonna bother the idea for MA chassis suspension as a good idea, the need for constant maintenance isn't worth it imho, gonna wait some expert make some idea of reliable suspension for ME chassis instead tbh.

\- Why bother with MA chassis? it just fun and fast, i did race with some local MS flex build, it catch up, run fast on straights and make them confused lol.

\- Most parts using replica / off brand (especially stays and rollers), tamiya original threaded shaft isn't too strong, also goes for wheel shaft sometimes easy too bend, the black shaft would chew gears a lot since it has too much slacks on gear, tamiya carbon wheels a bit tricky to balance and would become wobbly after long of use (idk why), for tires i go for Hard replica since there's no black original hard tires, just for the looks lol.

\- I don't have a lot of tools for Mini 4WD, just power drill and dream lol jk, i have mostly basic stuff, power drill, angle grinder, hand made mini grinder from old dc motor, unfortunately i don't have digital caliper (must have this tbh) just ye ancient steel one, for weight scaling, i borrowed the coffee bean scale lol (if possible go get better scale).

\- If you want to make open class, i think you should go for pre cutted chassis, also get carbon stay kits which cut with CNC machines (far better than using tools of saw table with manual cut) or PnP sets, if possible use original grade stay since the original parts have precise holes, always ask the seller information, how they made it and machines they have, else you're screwed with replica + hand cutted, this maybe cost more expensive but it would guarantee the precision and the grade quality.

\- If somehow you determined to do it by yourself, go get necessary tools first, original stays (don't get FRP, get the carbon) for holes, use replica cheap stays and start there, see how things work, you can do it.

\- the reason for side by side with CFM for comparison and test on track against each other, since theres a factor which would make the track bend (except 5 lanes since some build very rigid).

\- Most information either from experiences, local, online posts and videos, i won't take any credits and thanked the community for a lot of stuff to learn.

Sorry for long post mate, let me tell you, i'm no expert, i tend to learn more with direct approach and failures as lesson, that's why i like this hobby with handycraft, i bound to make mistakes but i also learn from it, my dream goal rn is just to make a car with a setup which could run on any class type track just fine, made full course at ease, which MA isn't, why? the bloody god damn CFM already did, let me tell you these old meta CFM build would tackle any tracks just fine, the customization just switching the motors or gears setup which is nuts, unbelievable! lol (made it to the finish but not as fast against a very fine tuned car fitted to the track).

I don't have enough experience on 5 lane tracks, mostly i run on 3 lanes, there's a reason meta is a meta, if you want to compete, just found the meta and follow it ig, but if you want to have fun, just do whatever you want (but please follow the rules guidelines and make sure your build fit the bill if you plan to compete), my takes on competition? tbh it's luck factor, motors, batteries, fresh parts would give more edge, the setup mostly follow meta the difference would be roller models, size, angle, tires size and types, competition is very different against solo / free run, since you run the car with other people (literaly bend the track on 3 lane).

For the love of god, if you want to try these builds make sure to match your own local rule, if it's for fun sake? absolutely try it, i'm just following the idea of playing the game the way i found it, i felt if you stick to meta too much it could kill creativity imho, any inputs, idea or critique would help, that's it, have a nice day.",1,1763135491.0,mini4wd,0,1.0,False

So this one comes up *allllll the time* in DMs. So I decided it's worth a quick explainer on what “asking for a recommendation” really means in BigLaw recruiting — and how to do it without fishing, forcing it, or making the other person (or you) horrendously uncomfortable.

# 1. First, the truth: many, if not most, recommendations are offered, not asked.

In my experience (and many of the recruits who've come through this sub), the strongest internal recommendations happen when:

* You had a genuinely good conversation
* You showed clear interest in their practice/office
* You followed up well (and usually had multiple points of contact over a period of time)
* And the attorney *volunteers* to pass your resume along, without you asking

People are much more likely to go to bat for you when it feels natural and earned. Remember, asking can make it feel super transactional. You don't want transactional (mostly because it often doesn't work, or at least not for very long). You want *an advocate.* Like a real *evangelist*. The kind of person who will bring you up in a conversation when you aren't there and say ""That guy? Omg love that guy. Why aren't we interviewing him? We should interview him.""

# 2. But yes — sometimes you can ask. But to avoid awkwardness, here’s how to do it.

You **don’t** ask:  
“Hey, can you recommend me?” (You can just feel the awkward seeping out of your screen, right?)

You **do** ask:  
“Would it be okay if I mentioned our conversation when I apply?”  
or  
“I just submitted my application, I’d appreciate any advice on how best to position myself or who I else I should try to speak to now that the application is in.”

Those two lines signal interest, not pressure.  
  
If they want to recommend you (and you've built up enough goodwill by that point), they’ll take it from there.

# 3. Many firms run internal surveys after networking events.

Many firms send internal surveys to attorneys after coffee chats, receptions, or OCI events.

The survey often literally asks something like: *“Would you recommend this student for further consideration?”*

Meaning: sometimes you might be “recommended” without ever knowing it. 

And for what it's worth, really something as small as just following up in an email and doing just one extra talk with someone is all it takes for them to forward your name to recruiting, so don't undersell the power of that one extra call. 

# 4. How to increase the chances they want to recommend you

Focus on:

* Asking thoughtful, specific questions (i.e., avoid the easily googlable like ""whats a day in the life like"")
* Showing real interest in the practice (not generic “what’s the culture like”)
* Connecting your background to their work if you can (or at least, how the things you learned somewhere else led you to be curious about their practice)
* Being easy to talk to and prepared to chat about why you're interested in their firm/group

You don’t need to be perfect. Just be a normal, prepared, curious human being.

# 5. Final reassurance

Plenty of people get recommended without ever asking — because they showed up well in a chat and made an impression.  
  
If someone wants to recommend you, they *will*. If they don’t, forcing doesn't usually help.

I walked into this location the first time with a relative last week. She ordered a coffee, asked to have two honeys instead of sugar. This manager with high energy started to mock my relative, giggling along with it seemed to be a teen in training beside her. At a point I thought either there was something special going on or we were being pranked. As the manager was giggling taking order from my relative, told her she would have to charge her for the two honeys, I asked the teen what was going on and he just kept giggling. Then I noticed when the manager was asking if my relative wanted one or two honeys, she put up her two middle fingers went up and down (like the kids do the 6/7 hand gestures, but with her middle fingers), asked if she wanted one or two honeys. I was shocked to the point my brain froze and didn’t know how to react. 

I went back to same location just to confirm the manager’s name a couple days later. She served me but was acting completely normal this time, friendly, nothing out of ordinary.  I addressed my concerns to the customer relations by email, I requested to be contacted. Got a pretty generic reply from the customer relations and was told I would be contacted by the restaurant. I never heard back from anyone. 

I mean, this was the most disrespected unprofessional behavior I have ever encountered from any customer service industry.

I read Google reviews and there seems to be two totally different kinds of reviews from this manager Lisa, and I also experienced both. It’s seems McDonald’s could care less about their employees behaving unprofessionally. ",0,1763135393.0,oakville,8,0.47,False

Everyone made comments and my guy Jordan would just be like “yeah I love coffee been drinking it since I was born in Seattle.” So it’s not a secret but today we botb had a random off Friday ( we don’t work together anymore) and we decided to grab some breakfast. We are sitting at this little local breakfast place and Jordan of course orders a coffee. They bring him out a cup and with that a full carafe so he can refill himself. Well sure enough this guy finishes the entire carafe of coffee before our food even comes out. He then drink another full carafe while eating and then for our like 20 mins of conversation after our food he threw down another. This man straight up drink I am not kidding like 11 to 13 cups of coffee. I’m not even close to exaggerating. He seemed fine like no big deal. I made a comment and he just said “I can drink cofee as long as they keep coming out to me” and this man drinks it black no cream no sugar just black.

TLDR: just be disciplined with your prep and you’ll be ok.

I’m 27, undergrad in industrial engineering from Mexico, master’s in engineering management in the US and have my PM experience in my own IT-consultancy before we ceased operations and currently in my family business (hospitality) in Mexico.

I drove 6 hours to Phoenix, Arizona from south of the border to take the test Monday November 10th (Didn’t stay for the PMI Summit). My accommodations at home and at my office aren’t that optimal and I’ve read too much horror stories in this subreddit to take the chance. I went the safe route and booked the test at a Pearson VUE center around two months ago to force me to study. 

Around a year ago I took online live prep from Latin America’s most marketed PMP course and I regret it. Prep was in Spanish and as soon as I realized the question translations are crap I wanted to get out of that course. Don’t do the same as I did. On top of that I was missing the required experience back then. Just stick to the online courses available and be disciplined with the preparation. That’s the key.

I followed Andrew Ramdayal’s 30 day study guide along with the Udemy course, I completed it in around 45 days. Did PMI’s study hall essentials for the practice tests and questions. When reviewing don’t get fixated on the expert questions explanations. If best ignore them. They mess up with the mindset and the logic to solve both situational and process questions. Got an 81% on AR’s Udemy test, from 60-80% on study hall quizzes and 73% in only one practice test.

Didn’t even think in booking the test in Spanish I did it in English. I went for a light run with my girlfriend in the morning and had a very heavy breakfast with coffee to avoid falling asleep in the test. The first 1/3 was easy, the second 1/3 moderate and the last part really hard. Around 5 drag and drops and other 5 select twos in that last part. No calculations only match with the EVM formula. I used ALL of the time available.

I’m moving abroad during the next year and hopefully the PMP and a couple more certifications in the next months will help me with the career step up. Thank you all as I read this subreddit during the whole year.",1,1763135113.0,pmp,1,1.0,False

I've been considering upgrading my 1zpresso J-Max for a while now, partially because hand grinding is getting old, but primarily to get something more suitable for modern, light-roast espresso (I might use the replacement for pour over if it's capable, but will primarily keep using my ZP6). I'm pretty set on a single-dosing workflow as I change beans quite regularly. Low retention is preferrable.

I've spotted a used DF83 V2 in my area, and wonder what your opinion is on this grinder in 2025. From a quick glance online, the consensus seems that while capable of making good coffee, it can be a pain in terms of retention unless you mod or remove the declumper, and it's overall just not as good a product as the DF83V. Still though, no such thing as a bad product, only a bad price, amirite? The burrs seem to be good all-rounders, not necessarily shining at light roasts, but I'm open to getting another burr set at some point, especially if the price for the grinder itself is reasonable.

Anything I miss here? Particular other grinder recs people have that make this grinder wholly irrelevant? People have particular experiences (good or bad) that they'd like to share?

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a same-game parlay that’s smoother than a Zamboni on a caffeine buzz. The St. Louis Blues (-140) host the Philadelphia Flyers (+116) on November 14, 2025, and the numbers are screaming for a combo bet that’s as bold as a power-play hat trick. Let’s dissect this like a coach critiquing a rookie’s neutral-zone turnover.

---

### Parsing the Odds: When Math Meets Menace

The Blues are the clear favorites here, with implied probabilities of **58.3%** to win (thanks to their -140 moneyline). The Flyers? They’re the hockey version of a “long shot” at the casino—**46.3%** implied chance to pull off the upset. But don’t let the Flyers’ underdog status fool you; they’ve won 3 of 10 games as underdogs this season, which is about the same odds as finding a spare sock in a laundromat.

The Over/Under is set at **5.5 goals**, with bookmakers projecting a combined 6 goals. Both teams are leakier than a sieve in the net: St. Louis allows 6.3 goals per game, and Philly does the same. The Over has decimal odds hovering around **1.9**, implying a **52.6%** chance. Given that the Blues have gone Over 5.5 goals in **10 of 17 games** this season, and the Flyers in **7 of 16**, this feels like a statistical inevitability.

Let’s start with the star power. DataSkrive’s analysis (courtesy of Bleacher Nation) suggests **Pius Suter** of the Blues has a solid shot at lighting the lamp tonight. Suter’s been hotter than a penalty kill in a shootout, and with the Flyers’ defense looking like a group of penguins on a trampoline, his chances are as good as a coffee order at 7 a.m.

On the Flyers’ side, **Jimmy Snuggerud** is the subject of DataSkrive’s other article, but let’s cut to the chase: Philly’s offense is about as reliable as a Wi-Fi signal in a submarine. Their power play? A 12% conversion rate. Their penalty kill? A 78% success rate. Translation: They’re better at *not* scoring than scoring.

Injuries? No major names listed, but the Flyers’ goalie situation is as stable as a toddler on a unicycle. Their starter has a .902

1owzs4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1owzs4v/aitah_for_taking_advantage_of_a_guy_who_wanted_to/,AITAH for taking advantage of a guy who wanted to serve me?,"This is probably the craziest thing that's ever happened to me. I'm going to be fully honest in this post even if it paints me in a bad light because I want honest reviews. 

It started about a year ago when I was still in college. I (24F now) matched with this guy (38M) on bumble. At first, he seemed like a normal dude, works in tech, kept saying how pretty I was. We exchanged number and I’d text him when I was bored or wanted some validation.

But after a bit of time he started being weird, like making comments saying he’d do anything for me. I thought it was just his way of flirting or something, but he really insisted. Then, he wired me money, like 100$. I was a broke masters student at the time, so seeing the money on my account, that got my attention 

I asked him why he sent it. He said just wanted to be useful to me, that he didn't want sex or anything, just to serve me. I was curious, so I tested it. I told him he could come do my dishes. He actually came and cleaned everything. I thought okay, why not, I could get used to this.

So I started texting him every now and then, for errands, chores, random stuff I didn't feel like doing, and he kept sending weekly money in exchange. Whatever I asked he'd just say yes and obey. In the beginning I was a bit freaked out, like I was a 23-year-old college girl at the time, and I had this grown man at my disposal. But after some time I just accepted it, I figured if a man wants to pay me to make my life easier I'm not gonna stop him.

Eventually I graduated and had to move out for my new job. He handled everything, which was very convenient. Then once I settled, I figured I was done with all that, so I told him we could stop now that I'm stable. 

But he literally begged me not to. Said he wants to continue, that he'll do anything, etc. I was annoyed so I told him if he wants me to keep him, then he has to pay my rent on top of the spending money he sends me. My rent is quite expensive so I was sure he'd say no and leave. But he actually accepted. 

I hesitated because I really wanted a fresh start, but he kept begging, so I eventually caved. I figured free rent is not bad, plus my new place was bigger so I could use someone to keep it clean.

But I guess from then on since I didn't really need him anymore, my behaviour shifted. I became entitled and snappy, like ""do this"", bossing him around like a dog and giving him every menial task I could think of. I was kind of irritated by him so I stopped acting nice, but he was useful and didn't mind my attitude, so I kept him. 

So it's been like this for almost a year now. He pays my rent, and the money he sends more or less covers my everyday expenses, so I've been saving up most of my salary. He cleans my apartment top to bottom, does groceries, returns my articles, shows up whenever I text him, even if it's just for coffee. He never says no to me, never talks back, he thanks me and praises me all the time like I'm some kind of queen. Sometimes I tell him to stand in the corner and face the wall until I need something, and he does.  When he messes something up or I'm in a bad mood I take it out on him in whatever way and he just apologizes. I could get into specifics but basically, I just make full use of him and he takes it 

No one around me really knows about this, I'm on dating apps a lot so if they see him people just assume he's some guy I'm seeing. But recently, one of my friends was staying over at my place, and she witnessed the dynamic. She was confused when she saw me ordering him around, so I explained everything to her. She listened, then she said it's not okay that I'm taking advantage of him like that. It was the first time I had an outside perspective on this and actually questioned it, so I wanted to ask more people their view on all this. AITAH?",0,1763134677.0,AITAH,12,0.5,False

1owzmyt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1owzmyt,Spotlighting Effy - one of the UK's most cutting-edge cafes,"I'm so very lucky to have one of the best coffee shops in the UK (and maybe the world), right in my home city of Nottingham, so here's just some of the things that make them so special:

\- They have connections and friendships with basically all the top European roasters, and almost always have coffees from DAK or Tanat/PeoplePossession on guest and house, as well as a very wide variety of other options

\- Rigorous testing of beans for taste and solubility, they test everything before they put full orders into roasters which, means that you're getting the best of the best quality from the best of the best roasters. Because they have this reputation, roasters will often send Effy their highest-quality batches, so a bag of coffee from effy will probably be better than the same coffee bought online!

\- 20+ years of experience brewing coffee means their techniques are refined and on the cutting-edge, they've given me advice that I haven't seen anyone give on this sub that has so simply made my coffee better

\- No traditional 'house' coffee, every few days they choose one of their guest beans to put on 'house' and charge house rate for, you'll never get served a boring blend or something classic-tasting

\- Pricing is almost unbelievably reasonable, they use all their coffee knowledge to keep extraction up while keeping prices down, this includes (look away r/espresso users) 11g espresso doses (yes, they genuinely do taste good every time), which means they can charge as seen in the picture even with some of the priciest coffee you can buy, this is also helped by...

\- Their own micro-bakery, which serves classics like their brown butter cookie and a constantly changing roster of new recipes, everything is absolutely delicious, and the owner very impressively taught himself to bake it all

\- The staff are very friendly and open to chat about coffee or pretty much anything else, this may be because, as i'm told, about 2/3 of their customers are regulars, when you get the same people coming in that often you build a lot of rapports, and they're so welcoming and accommodating

1owzmgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1owzmgo/the_ultimate_guide_to_sleep/,The ultimate guide to sleep,"Sleep is one of the most important things when it comes to the overall quality of your life. It directly affects your energy levels, mood, productivity and much more. In my opinion, it should be one of the first things to tackle on any self-improvement journey.

I recently had to do a lot of research on the topic to write an article and figured I might as well reformat it for Reddit and post here. While going through different sleep frameworks and testing routines (I even tried Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in an app called *Sleepr* at one point), I realized how many small things add up to better rest. This post will go over:

1. Sleep schedules
2. How much sleep you need
3. How to establish a new sleep schedule
4. How to fall asleep
5. How to wake up
6. Some General tips for sleep
7. What to do when you miss your schedule



**Sleep Schedule**

I know most people won't be able to follow a schedule perfectly, so take this part as a ""best case"" scenario.

A fixed sleep schedule can work wonders by itself. All you have to do is go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. This allows your body to adjust its natural rhythm.

When I first got adjusted to a regular sleep schedule, I noticed that I wasn’t only falling asleep quicker and waking up on time; I was also dreaming much more than before.

Your schedule should be important to you. Don’t keep watching YouTube videos, browsing Reddit or doing anything else when you should be sleeping. You’ll only be more tired the next day and have less energy.

It’s a loop of staying on your phone, getting less sleep, having less energy and more stress the next day, and staying on your phone to build off stress again. You’ll feel much better once you drop the habit of using your phone in bed.

Social activities like parties can get in the way of your schedule sometimes, but try to keep exceptions to a minimum. We’ll look at ways to fix your schedule after a night out later in this post.

**How much sleep do you need?**

I recommend starting with 8. You can then try changing it in increments of 30 minutes and see whether 7:30 is enough or if you need 9 hours. Genetics and the amount of activity during the day play a major role in the needed amount of sleep.

If you are younger, you'll probably lean towards 8-9 required hours, while older people might be fine with 7-8 hours. Keep in mind that the amount of sleep refers to time spent sleeping, not time spent laying in bed.

**How to establish a new sleep schedule**

1. **Start by setting your times in stone.** Write the exact time you want to go to bed and the time you want to wake up at down. This time should be the same for weekdays and the weekend. Sleeping in on weekends will mess up your natural rhythm and you won’t need it if you get enough sleep during the week.
2. **Set a single alarm for your wake-up time.** Using multiple alarms is a bad habit and encourages you to oversleep. You’ll associate the sound of the alarm with *“I can sleep a bit more until the next one”* and not with *“I need to wake up now”*. Using a single alarm for the first time might be scary, but the anxiety of oversleeping will usually get you up right away.
3. **Fast for 16 hours.** Look at the time you want to wake up at and count 16 hours back from it. For example, if you want to wake up at 5:30 am, that would be 1:30 pm the day before. On the first day of adjusting to a new schedule, start fasting at that time and eat nothing until you wake up in the morning. Prepare your breakfast in advance so you can eat as soon as you wake up. If you struggle with eating in the morning, try something like a protein shake or fruit. You only need to do this once to adjust to your new schedule. The fasting will reset your biological clock as your body is programmed to be awake for eating and will adjust to the times you eat. By fasting and then eating as soon as you wake up, you can reset that mechanism.

**How to fall asleep**

Falling asleep quickly is a problem for many people. While having a set schedule helps a lot, there’s still more you can do:

**Have a screen-free hour before bed**

Falling asleep is the process of your body and mind winding down after a stressful day. You can decide whether that process starts an hour before you go to bed, or whether that process only starts after you put your phone away one hour into laying in bed.

Looking at screens like your laptop or smartphone strains your eyes and prevents your body from producing Melatonin, which regulates your sleep-wake cycle.

Instead of browsing the Internet, use that hour for relaxing activities. You can read with dim light, draw, meditate, write or do something else that helps you calm down. Give your body a chance to wind down so you can fall asleep quickly.

**Control your breath**

Use breathing techniques to breathe slower. This helps tremendously with calming down and will impact how quickly you fall asleep. You can follow the 4-7-8 routine:

1. Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound.
2. Close your mouth and inhale quietly through your nose to a mental count of four.
3. Hold your breath for a count of seven.
4. Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound to a count of eight.

This is one breath. Now inhale again and repeat the cycle three more times for a total of four breaths. If you are not getting enough air, try it with 4-4-4 seconds first.

**Count backward from 200**

This is a simple but effective technique. Mentally count from 200 backward with your eyes closed. Counting sheep is a great alternative to this and great for boring yourself to sleep.

The act of focusing on something calming prevents yourself from getting excited because you’re thinking about doing things. Research shows that just thinking about an activity like playing tennis is enough to raise your blood pressure. Thinking of mundane and calming scenarios that don’t involve yourself moving is best for calming down.

**Use the 2-minute technique**

The US military developed this technique to allow jet pilots to fall asleep quickly between missions. It works like this:

1. Relax all the muscles in your face, including tongue, jaw and the muscles around the eyes
2. Drop your shoulders as far down as they’ll go, followed by your upper and lower arm, one side at a time
3. Breathe out, relaxing your chest followed by your legs, starting from the thighs and working down
4. Spend 10 seconds trying to clear your mind before thinking about one of the three following images:

* You’re lying in a canoe on a calm lake with nothing but a clear blue sky above you
* You’re lying in a black velvet hammock in a pitch-black room
* You say ‘don’t think, don’t think, don’t think’ to yourself over and over for about 10 seconds.

If you get used to this technique, meaning that you use it every time you fall asleep for multiple weeks, it’ll start working like magic.

I calm my breath down with the 4-7-8 technique for 5 breaths, then I start with this 2-minute routine. If that’s not enough, I’ll either start counting from 200 backward or get up and try again after 15-20 minutes.

**Exercise**

Working out during the day helps you fall asleep much more quickly. as it uses up your energy In turn, you will sleep more and end up with more energy the next day. That’s the reason regular exercise increases the energy you have available in the long run instead of using it up.

If you’re not into sports, you should still at least take a walk or do some lighter exercising.

**Watch your nutrition and caffeine intake**

Caffeine affects your body for 4-12 hours after ingesting it. This means that having a coffee at lunch can impact your sleep, even though they are quite a bit apart.

Eating can have just as much of an effect on your sleep. Try not to eat anything in the last 2 hours before going to bed. You can still drink some water if you need to.

Getting the right nutrients has major effects on your life so it is always worth sorting that out.

**Improve your sleeping environment**

Is your room too warm? Does light get into your room at night? Is there a lot of noise coming in from outside? What about your pillows and your mattress?

All these factors impact the quality of your sleep and you should look into all of them. Sleep takes up roughly one-third of your day and will continue doing so for the rest of your life, so it is worth optimizing.

Generally, an optimal sleep environment is:

* Cool
* Dark
* Quiet
* Comfortable
* Stress-free
* Only used for sleep or intimate relations

**Look into other factors**

Stress, kids, drugs/alcohol, sleep apnea, insomnia, and other issues can have a major effect on your sleep. All of those things affect your energy, mood, happiness, and productivity.

Seek help for these kinds of issues. Home remedies and techniques can’t fix everything and there are people who work on these things professionally.

**How to wake up**

Waking up in the morning can be challenging, especially if you didn’t quite get enough sleep. Here’s a list of things you can do to make sure you get out of bed:

* **Have only one alarm.** Multiple alarms only encourage you to ignore them and make you more likely to oversleep.
* **Use the 5-second rule.** As soon as you hear the alarm you go 5-4-3-2-1 (out loud or in your mind) and you get out of bed. Don’t give your mind time to convince you to stay in there.
* **Get out of bed.** Getting out of bed is usually the hardest part, but as soon as you’re not in there anymore it is much easier to stay awake.
* **Have a morning routine.** I always drink a glass of water right after waking up, then I take a cold shower. A set routine can help override the emotional part of your brain.
* **Turn the light on.** Light tells your body that it is daytime and helps ease the sleepiness.
* **Use a smart alarm clock.** There are lots of different models of clocks that need more than just a press of a button to turn off. Whether you need to solve a puzzle first or go to your bathroom to take a picture, they’ll usually wake you right up. 
* **Make staying in bed uncomfortable.** You can achieve this by opening the window blinds or turning the heat on automatically each morning so the bed gets too warm.

After a few days of adjusting to your new schedule, you should be able to wake up even without a clock most of the time. If you oversleep a lot, you might need to adjust your sleep time and add half an hour.

**Other tips for sleep**

* If you can’t fall asleep within 20-30 minutes of laying in bed, get out and do something else for 15 minutes, then try again.
* Some people focus better in the mornings; others function best in the evenings. Adjust your schedule accordingly.
* If you work from home or don’t have many social distractions, it might be worth looking into polyphasic sleep. Polyphasic sleep is about sleeping multiple times a day (taking a nap is the most common form of polyphasic sleep) to reduce the time spent sleeping while maintaining energy levels.
* The best positions for sleep are flat on your back or your side. Depending on circumstances, some others might work well too. Sleeping on your stomach is generally considered the worst position, as it puts a lot of pressure on your body and strains your back.
* Calming sounds or white noise can help you fall asleep. There are lots of websites or apps that allow you to play forest sounds, rain, or static noise.
* About 3% of the world’s population possesses a gene that allows them to function just fine with only 6 hours of sleep. Research into whether this is healthy doesn’t seem complete yet though.

**What to do when you miss your sleep schedule**

Sometimes life gets in the way of sleep. There are two ways of getting back on track after:

If you’re only running one or two hours late on your schedule, go to bed and try to get the most out of it. You can work on the accumulated sleep debt by adding half an hour to your sleep for the next couple of days if you need it.

However, if you missed more than half of your sleep, try to stay awake for the whole night. Then treat your sleep time as if you were adjusting to a new schedule. Fast for 16 hours before your next wake-up time or at least try to skip dinner. Have a coffee in the morning so you can stay awake during the day.

I’d also recommend adding at least 30 minutes to your sleep for the following week to get rid of the sleep debt.

1owzikp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1owzikp,Why Is Alabama Hills So Popular Lately? Here’s the Real Reason,"Every time I pass through the Alabama Hills it feels like the secret is long gone. A few years ago you might run into a handful of campers. Now it’s vans, Jeeps, rooftop tents, rental RVs, photographers, film crews… the whole outdoor community.

And honestly, it makes sense. The place has everything going for it:

• The scenery is unreal. The rock formations look like something between a western movie set and Mars. You point a camera anywhere and get a good shot.
• Mt Whitney towering in the background. It’s one of the most dramatic mountain backdrops in the entire country.
• It’s easy to get to. You’re five minutes from Lone Pine. Gas, food, coffee, supplies, all right there. Zero stress.
• Free dispersed camping. No reservations, no complicated rules, just roll in and find a spot. That alone makes it a magnet.
• Movie Road nostalgia. Decades of films were shot here, from old westerns to modern sci-fi. People love seeing those landscapes in real life.
• Perfect overnight stop. Whether you’re doing Hwy 395, heading to Whitney, crossing into Death Valley, or road tripping the Sierra… it’s the ideal halfway point.
• Photographers go crazy here. Sunrise and sunset light up the rocks like fire. The whole area looks like it’s built for timelapses.
• It fits every style of camping. Overlanders, vanlifers, backpackers, travelers in rental SUVs, even people who just want to sleep under the stars for one night. No gatekeeping required.

So yeah, it’s busy… but the popularity isn’t a mystery. It checks every box: beauty, convenience, freedom, and that unique Eastern Sierra vibe you can’t fake.

And despite the crowds, every time I go back, I get it all over again. It’s still one of the most incredible places to camp in the west.",10,1763134092.0,TruckCampers,6,0.68,False

1owzi6y,https://i.redd.it/zkdcgtmsq81g1.jpeg,New Member of the Club,"So my wife is a coffee addict and I have begged her for a long time to get a ""real"" coffee maker. She finally settled on the KBGV select. I do enjoy coffee but am by no means a coffee expert. I am a little underwhelmed with MM to be honest so I decided to see if we were using it incorrectly. It appears a rookie mistake is using preground coffee as we did with a typical percolator coffee maker. If I understand the issue preground coffee is too fine and leads to a more bitter taste which I did find it to be. 

So would any coffee grinder do or is there a recommended one to get? Also I know it's personal preference but any recommendation on which coffee beans to use? I am in the States fwiw. 

If I can get the coffee to that next level and maximize the performance of the MM it would be such a nice surprise for my wife who loves her coffee. 

I will continue doing some research but if there are any other typical rookie mistakes that I shoukd be aware of please let me know. Thanks in advance and I am looking forward to getting the most out of my MM!

Because of work pressure, I barely had time for anything other than eat and sleep.

My family is in Europe — they had to leave Syria years ago — and I can’t go to them, and they can’t come here. I feel completely alone, like I have nobody to talk to.

Sometimes I just sit in silence, thinking about how lonely life can get when you’re away from everyone you love.

I’m not asking for much… just hoping to meet someone to talk to, share a coffee with, or just have a normal conversation.

If anyone out there feels the same, maybe we can make this loneliness a little lighter together.

Last night, around 9:30 I could feel *something is very wrong*

I drank salt, drank my magnesium, ate dinner.   Took my nightly L-Tryptophan.  I've been off CBD for 3 days awaiting an upcoming EEG.  

I woke up at 1am to a visual hallucination. 

I opened my eyes and saw a treble clef floating about 6-7 feet in front of me, eyes open.   It looked like it was IN my room.  

The image was black lines like a regular musical treble clef and persisted for about 7 seconds before fading out. (I'm a musician so this has meaning)

A few minutes after that, I had a strong involuntary muscle jerk that started in my left shoulder blade and was forceful enough to throw both my hands off my torso.  


The event happened about an hour after taking 500mg L-tryptophan and 200mg magnesium at bedtime. It was also a heavy workout day with iron supplementation, and I hadn’t had any coffee. 


These hallucination events have been getting much more frequent and it's up to like once a week now.  


Throughout my life I've had so many symptoms consistent with temporal lobe epilepsy, especially the hypergraphia part.  I write EVERYTHING down because it's the only way I'll remember to do stuff or capture it.  

And the Déjà vu's....don't even get me started 

Can anyone relate to this entire description, or do you experience focal seizures differently?


Yes, I have a neurologist, a psychologist, therapist, yes I've gotten an MRI.  (Happen to share details if anyone is curious to know it in good faith over DM)

If anyone happens to be in Dallas area & knows some good doctors who can help also,

1owze0u,https://i.redd.it/vv62q2zpj81g1.png,Free Splitwise alternative with unlimited expenses and no ads,"A couple years ago, my wife and I were traveling through Thailand when Splitwise suddenly started limiting free accounts to just 2 expenses per day. We had dozens of expenses to track daily (street food, tuk-tuks, accommodations, etc), so we either had to pay for Premium just to add expenses, or find something else.

Frustrated, we looked for alternatives but nothing convinced us. So my wife and I built Splital, our own app to split expenses with no expenses limits, no ads, and all the core features free.

**Free Features:**

* No ads
* Login is optional to respect your privacy
* Add all the expenses you want with no limits
* Split expenses equally, by percentage, or exact amounts.
* Enable/Disable simplify debts
* Save and reuse your preferred split automatically
* Automatic expense categorisation
* Search expenses
* 150+ currencies
* Notifications

We’re bootstrapped, so we also have some paid features to make it sustainable for us, but everything I wrote in this post is free.

I was also with a 3-year-old child, and the baristas were openly **talking about vulgar topics and cursing loudly**, not minding us or the other customers. The **quality of the coffee has also changed**.

1owzcc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/felinebehavior/comments/1owzcc2/cats_on_counters/,Cats on counters.,"I’m just wanting advice on what to do with my 8yr old cat. I love her dearly she is a wonderful cat in regard to personality and how affectionate she is but she has the worst and I mean worst food motivation/obsession. 

My husband and I have tried everything to keep her off of our counters but it does not matter she will still get up there, even with tin foil or sticky tape. We can clean everything up and she will still be in the sink licking it like there’s food in there even when it’s been washed and cleaned… I put soapy water in dishes that need to soak, she still drinks the water…. You cannot leave for even 5 seconds and she will get up there to find anything. This cat is fed literally the best diet ever as well. She never eats dry food she gets strictly wet food or viva raw and supplemental things with it. Shes a well bred cat, I got her from a breeder that is legit and genuinely cares about her cats and all are in depth health tested I mean she’s literally 100% healthy coming from a vets view so I just don’t know how to fix this. Her breeder said she was very crazed about food even when she had her and warned me to watch her with that because she will just eat until she pukes then go back for more. I mean if I let her eat as much as she wants she would probably be a 30lb cat. 

Is there something behaviorally wrong with her that she can see a vet for potentially and get meds? It’s like she has food anxiety like 24/7 fixated on it. She cannot stay off of the counters for even an hour it’s like every hour every day she has to make her rounds to make sure nothing was out she can snatch. She even goes as far as to try and drink our coffee because of the milk/creamer in it. We have had to child proof our pantry door where we keep the garbage because she will get into it 24/7 and learned how to open the door. I mean she will literally sit by the door for hours sniffing it and putting her paws under trying to pry it open. If I open the fridge she’s on her back legs trying to look/get into it. We left for vacation one time and I left out Stella and chewys freeze dried raw for them like 2 days worth of food and she ate almost all of it within the hour of me putting it out- we hadn’t even left yet…. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated as we do love her entirely but this has seriously stressed us out and has made us get into arguments constantly when she gets into things like “well you know better why would you leave that out” kind of thing. I just want all of us to be happy ya know? (P.S. we have another cat as well we got later on and it hasn’t changed her behavior one bit if anything she uses the other cat to get more food by bullying her away from her food dish)   ",2,1763133699.0,felinebehavior,3,1.0,False

My aunt is still in, a full-on pioneer with 50 years in the service. She dreams of the day I ""return to Jehovah.""

Here’s the thing: I don't believe the doctrine. Not one bit. But I’m not bitter. My philosophy has always been practical: I left because it was better 'out' than 'in.' If it gets better 'in' than 'out,' I’d go back.

And lately, 'out here' is getting tough. I’m incredibly lonely. No real friends, no girlfriends.

Out here in the world, I'm a government employee. It’s a total dead-end job, the kind where you’re just a body filling a seat. My main task is just to show up. A complete nobody.

Meanwhile, my aunt keeps painting this picture of the ""best life ever"" in the congregation. Barbecues, get-togethers, ""good, honest, orderly people."" The life she paints doesn't seem undesirable, frankly.

Then she dropped the bait.

She mentioned a recent talk about ""Marrying Only in the Lord"" and how it's so hard for the sisters, given the 75% women to 25% men ratio. She told me about a specific Sister who is desperate to get married.

She said this Sister is ""foreign"" and from an ""unknown family."" My aunt admitted that the local brothers are prejudiced and are overlooking her. She even hit me with the ""well, even Ruth was a foreigner"" line to justify it.

Then, she told me that I (the inactive 'worldly' guy) am a ""good man,"" ""better than many of the brothers they've got in there,"" and that I ""understand women"" in a way they don't. She wants to ""help us both"" and offered to have us over for coffee.

To top it all off, she hits my vanity. She said the congregation is struggling—they have few Elders and MSes, and they aren't appointing new ones. She said I ""could be so useful."" She flat-out said that if I come back and show I'm serious, I could be made a Ministerial Servant in ""a year or two.""

She even said that it's ""not as boring"" as I remember. She pointed out all the recent changes—that brothers can have beards, the dress code is more relaxed. She also stressed that for field service, I could just do letter writing or cart witnessing if I don't want to do door-to-door.

Then she hit me with her real reason. She said Jehovah wants works, and that if I am doing the work (meetings, service), even if I don't fully believe in my heart, Jehovah will be biblically obligated to save me. She said the End is ""very, very soon,"" and all she wants in her entire life is the peace of mind knowing I'll be ""inside"" and safe in Paradise.

So, I’m tempted. I'm tempted by the instant social life, the status, and the wife.

I know I don't believe. But I'm lonely. I feel like I could just go along... or am I just fooling myself about how bad it will be?",4,1763132860.0,exjw,9,0.83,False

I’m posting Chapter One to see if the writing lands—if it pulls you in, if it feels authentic, and if anyone wants to follow along as I keep building this out. Honest thoughts welcome.**

\# Chapter 1: Kerling — Siegfried Line

November 15, 1944. Near Kerling, Germany.

*By mid-November 1944 the Siegfried Line near Kerling had been weakened by weeks of pressure. American patrols from Third Army had been testing the German defensive positions since September, damaging pillboxes, cutting wire, and mapping out points of resistance.*

*On November 15, Troop D of the 90th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron was conducting one of these reconnaissance operations along the line.*

🔹

The radio cracks at 0520.

Staff Sergeant Edwin Reoch has the SCR-508 on the troop net, the 510 monitoring CCB. Captain Leach is two hundred yards ahead with First Platoon. The M8 Greyhounds are somewhere in the dark. 

Eddy can't see them.

Tom Watson sits beside him in the jeep. Hands on the wheel. Engine off. Cold knifes through the field jackets—November wet, the kind that crawls inside you. They're parked in a tree line east of Kerling. The trees are black skeletons against gray sky. Fog rolling through them. Thick. White. Smells like rain and earth and something burning far off.

Eddy flexes numb fingers until pain brings them back. Reminds himself they're still his.

""Delta-Six, this is Delta-One. Grid 842-397. Road clear to phase line. Over.""

First Lieutenant Fleming. First Platoon.

Eddy logs it—0520, grid 842-397, road clear—then keys the 508. ""Delta-One, roger. Stand by.

Tom watches the road. Nothing to see yet. Gray light. Mud. The edge of the Siegfried Line somewhere ahead in the fog. They've been in country eight weeks. First contact. First blood.

Eddy switches to the 510. CCB net. ""Tiger-Six, Delta-Six. First Platoon reports phase line clear. Awaiting orders. Over.""

Static. 

Fifteen seconds.

A voice comes back. Not Colonel Roberts. Someone at headquarters. Tired voice. Too much coffee voice.

""Delta-Six, continue reconnaissance. Report all enemy positions. Out.""

Eddy switches back to the 508. ""Delta-One, this is Delta-Six. Continue to objective. Report contact. Over.""

""Roger, Delta-Six. Moving now.""

Tom looks at him. ""Leach going with them?""

""Didn't say.""

""Bet your ass he is.""

The captain's twenty-two. Eddy's twenty-five. Tom's twenty-four.

Tom Watson. Six feet. Lanky. Dark hair. Quiet. Good hands on a wheel. Face like a high school quarterback gone to war. He doesn't talk much. Just drives. Just listens. Just keeps DRAFTY running when everything else breaks down.

The captain gives orders. Eddy makes sure they're heard. Tom drives. DRAFTY is Leach's command vehicle when they're not on patrol. Tom gets him where he needs to go.

That's how you stay alive.

The jeep's got a name painted on the side. DRAFTY. White letters. Hand-painted. Tom's idea from Camp Gordon. Named her himself. Talks to her like she's listening. Pats her hood when she starts cold. Checks her oil twice a day.

She's a Willys MB. Olive drab. Mud-caked. The windshield's folded down. Canvas top. SCR-508 and 510 radios mounted in back. Antennas swaying. Tools strapped to the side. Jerry cans. Ammo boxes. Everything they need to stay alive.

Eddy asked him once why he babies the jeep.

Tom said, ""Because if she quits, we die.""

That ended it.

Eddy checks the radios. 508 clear. 510 has static but it holds. Batteries good. Antennas up. Everything works.

It has to work.

At 0547 the 508 crackles again.

""Delta-Six, Delta-One. Contact. Infantry, estimate platoon strength. Dug in at grid 847-401. Requesting fire support. Over.""

Eddy drops to the log before Fleming finishes speaking.

0547. Contact. Infantry. Platoon. Grid 847-401.

He keys the mic. Voice calm. ""Delta-One, roger. Wait one.""

Tom starts the engine. No discussion needed.

Eddy switches to the 510. ""Tiger-Six, Delta-Six. Contact at grid 847-401. Infantry, platoon strength, dug in. First Platoon requesting fire support. Over.""

The reply comes fast. Someone was waiting for this call.

""Delta-Six, fire mission approved. Coordinates to Four-One-Niner. Over.""

Four-One-Niner. 419th Armored Field Artillery.

Eddy switches frequencies. Relays the coordinates. The artillery acknowledges. Professional voices. Calm voices. Voices that have done this before.

He switches back to the 508.

""Delta-One, fire mission approved. Four-One-Niner has your grid. ETA three minutes. Over.""

""Roger, Delta-Six. We're pulling back two hundred yards.""

He writes it down. 0549. Fire mission approved. First Platoon withdrawing.

Smart. Get clear of the impact zone.

Tom eases the jeep forward, lights dead, wheels grinding frozen ruts. They follow First Platoon's tracks. Eddy keeps one hand on the 508. One on the log. 

The artillery will come in at 0552.

First Platoon will observe.

At 0551 the guns open up.

Eddy hears them before he sees the impacts. A low rolling sound like distant thunder. Then freight trains tearing the sky open. The horizon lights up orange. One round. Two. Three. Four. The forest shakes. The jeep shakes. The air shakes. Eddy feels it in his chest. In his teeth. The pressure wave rolling over them.

Tom stops. They wait.

Eddy's ears ring. High whine. Won't stop. The air tastes like metal. Like cordite. Like something chemical and wrong.

At 0554 the 508 comes alive.

""Delta-Six, Delta-One. Enemy position destroyed. Moving forward to confirm. Over.""

Eddy keys the mic. ""Roger, Delta-One. Report.""

Two minutes of silence.

Eddy watches the road. Tom watches the tree line. The light's getting stronger now. Not much. Enough to see shapes. Enough to see where the shells hit. Black smoke against gray sky. Rolling. Oily. Smells like cordite and burning wood. The wind carries it toward them.

At 0556: ""Delta-Six, Delta-One. Position clear. Enemy KIA, estimate eight. No friendly casualties. Continuing to objective. Over.""

Eddy logs it. 

0556. Position clear. 8 KIA. No casualties.

He stares at what he just wrote. Eight. He called in coordinates and eight men died. His hand hovers over the page. Then keeps writing.

He looks at Tom.

Tom nods once.

They've been in country eight weeks. This is first contact.

Eight Germans dead.

No one from Troop D hit.

First blood drawn.

Eddy switches to the 510. ""Tiger-Six, Delta-Six. First Platoon reports position clear. Eight enemy KIA. No friendly casualties. Continuing mission. Over.""

""Roger, Delta-Six. Well done. Out.""

Tom puts the jeep in gear. They follow First Platoon toward the Siegfried Line.

That's when it starts.

\---

By 0800 they're two miles deeper. Road's mud and craters. They pass a burned-out Panzer IV—turret blown off, black char marks down the hull. Smells like cooked metal and burnt rubber and something else. Sweet. Wrong. Eddy doesn't look too close.

Captain Leach waves them forward. Tall. Lean. Field jacket mud-streaked. He briefs Eddy: stay on CCB net, keep the radios up, follow close. First Platoon takes point. At 0810 they move.

The Siegfried Line is concrete and wire. Dragon's teeth. Pillboxes. Empty. Germans pulled back during the night. First Platoon goes through without contact.

By noon they're six miles past Kerling. Halt at a crossroads. Tom eats a K-ration. Makes a face. ""If this is hash, the cow died of shame.""

Eddy opens his own. Cold. Gray. Congealed. Tastes like salted cardboard and grease. He eats it anyway.

At 1220 the 508 crackles.

""Delta-Six, this is Tiger-Six. New orders. Return to assembly area. CCB moving north. Acknowledge. Over.""

Eddy keys the mic. ""Tiger-Six, Delta-Six. Acknowledge return to assembly area. Over.""

""Roger. Move now. Out.""

Eddy climbs out of the jeep. Walks to Captain Leach. ""Sir. Orders from CCB. Return to assembly area. Division's moving north.""

Leach looks at him. Twenty-two years old. His eyes are older. He adjusts his helmet strap. Tightens it. Habit when he's thinking.

""North."" He doesn't ask why. Doesn't need to.

Eddy waits.

""Something's happening."" Leach looks at the map. Traces a line with his finger. North. Belgium. The Ardennes. He tightens his helmet strap again.

""Get everyone on the net. We're pulling back.""

Eddy returns to the jeep. Relays the orders. First Platoon. Second Platoon. Third Platoon. Captain Leach's command. 

By 1240 they're moving.

Tom drives. Eddy listens to static. They don't talk.

\---

That night they bivouac south of Metz. 

Eddy and Tom share a pup tent. Cold. Mud. Same as every night since Cherbourg. The canvas smells like mildew and diesel. Damp. Their sleeping bags are wet. The ground underneath is harder than it should be. Rocks. Roots. Eddy can feel every one.

Tom lights a cigarette. ""What do you think north means?""

""Belgium.""

""I know Belgium. I mean what's happening.""

""Don't know.""

Tom smokes. Eddy checks the radios one more time. Makes sure the batteries are charging. The 508's silent. The 510 has traffic but nothing for Troop D.

At 2100 Captain Leach comes by. ""Reoch.""

Eddy sticks his head out of the tent. ""Sir.""

""Be ready to move at 0500. We're going to Luxembourg.""

Eddy nods. ""Luxembourg.""

""0500.""

Leach walks away. 

Eddy pulls back into the tent.

Tom looks at him. ""Luxembourg?""

""That's what he said.""

""Why Luxembourg?""

Eddy doesn't answer. He knows why. Everyone knows why. 

The Germans are coming.

\---

A month later they'll be in Bastogne.

But on November 15, 1944, sitting in a pup tent south of Metz, Eddy Reoch doesn't know that yet. 

He knows the radios work. He knows Captain Leach gives orders. He knows Tom can drive a jeep through anything.

He knows eight Germans are dead at grid 847-401 and no one from Troop D is hit.

That's first contact. 

That's how it started.

Eddy finishes his cigarette. Stubs it out in the mud. 

He can still smell the barrage—cordite and burned wood. It's still on him.

He rolls over. Tries to sleep.

Outside the tent, the division's moving north.

1owyx0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePatternApp/comments/1owyx0n/i_tested_a_soulmate_feature_in_an_astrology_app/,I tested a soulmate feature in an astrology app… and I’m honestly freaked out because it described my partner perfectly (my opinion),"Okay, so I’m not the type who takes astrology apps super seriously. I like the memes, the daily horoscopes that are vague enough to apply to everyone, the aesthetic moon phases—whatever.

But then I saw this one feature in an astro app called Soulmate Sketch, and my curiosity beat my skepticism. I hit the button just to see what kind of woo-woo nonsense it would generate.

And I swear to god, the description it gave me was basically my partner in paragraph form.

Here’s the exact text I got:

“Your soulmate is a man with a restless, seeking mind—his thoughts move in quicksilver arcs, always searching for the deeper current beneath the surface of things. He has been healing from a betrayal that taught him to be wary of easy charm and hollow promises; trust is hard-won with him, but once given, he is all-in, fiercely loyal. When he falls in love, he becomes suddenly shy, almost awkward, as if startled by the strength of his own feelings. He will listen to you with an intensity that almost burns—his gaze will linger, as if he’s mapping the constellations of your face, trying to memorize every detail for the long nights ahead.”

Excuse me???
That is exactly my partner.

“Restless mind”? Yup.
“Still healing from past betrayal and slow to trust”? Unfortunately, yes.
“Turns shy when feelings hit too hard”? That’s literally his whole love language.
“And the way he listens like he’s downloading your soul”? I feel personally attacked.

But it gets weirder.

The app also described how we’d meet… and it accidentally recreated our actual first meeting

The reading said we’d meet between late summer and early fall, in a small indie coffee shop on a quiet side street, and that we’d both reach for the same old, worn-out book by the window.

I laughed out loud at first — until my brain suddenly went “WAIT.”

Because that is literally how we met.

Small hidden coffee shop.
Quiet corner.
Both grabbed the same book from the communal shelf.
Hands touched.
Cliché indie film moment.
I thought it was cute at the time… and now I’m wondering if this app has been spying on me.

Then it listed “three signs” before meeting your soulmate — and I definitely had one of them

The app said the signs would be:

A vivid dream of running through rain but staying dry.

Seeing 11:11 everywhere.

Randomly craving lemon.

I didn’t have all three.
But the 11:11 thing? Oh my god. I saw it constantly around that period. Clocks, receipts, screens, everywhere. It got annoying.

And the final advice the app gave me also matched what I was doing at the time

It told me to be vulnerable, to “show my real self,” to share my writing or creative work, and that my openness would be the thing that draws my soulmate in.

And yeah… that was exactly when I finally pushed myself to publicly share a creative project I’d been hiding for years.
And a few weeks later, boom — we met.

So now I’m confused

I’m not saying astrology apps are magical.
I’m not saying an algorithm summoned my boyfriend out of thin air.

But the accuracy?
The details?
The timing?

It’s… a lot.

Anyway, if you ever feel like astrology apps are pure entertainment, maybe try some of their weird features just for fun. Sometimes they point out something you didn’t even realize was already unfolding in your life.

If anyone else has had creepy-accurate soulmate readings, please tell me, because I need to know I'm not alone in this weirdness.",1,1763132741.0,ThePatternApp,9,0.67,False

After speaking with dozens of small business owners like bakers, caterers, salon owners, decorators, coffee shops, home chefs and tutors, I realized something super consistent:

They’re not using Asana, Trello, or Notion.  
They’re running *everything* on **WhatsApp**.

Orders, payments, schedules, delivery updates - all in chat threads.  
It’s quick, familiar, and fits their day.

But here’s the problem they all mentioned:

“We lose track of things because everything is buried in messages.”

So I built [**TodoBuddy.ai**](https://todobuddy.ai) \- an AI assistant that helps small business owners stay on top of their daily chaos *without leaving WhatsApp.*

You can just text naturally, like:  
💬 “Remind me to restock flour Friday.”  
💬 “Add Sarah catering order - 20 cupcakes on Tuesday.”  
💬 “Drop cake at Bob’s place - assign to David.”

TodoBuddy understands, structures, and reminds all inside WhatsApp.  
No new app. No logins. No friction.

Would love your thoughts, stories, or advice from anyone who’s built for SMBs or non-tech audiences especially if you’ve navigated similar adoption challenges.

Had mutual attraction with a researcher during my internship but never acted on it. Months later I still can’t stop thinking about him, and the only way to reach him now is work Slack/email. Not sure if reaching out is appropriate.  
  
I (23F) have developed interest in a early 30-something guy working at a university research lab. We met while I was doing an internship project under a different professor (so not directly working with / under him). He showed interest in getting to know me and signs of attraction that he poorly tried to hide. He always sat next to me during lunch breaks (even showing some dissapointment when he was not able to), his eyes were always on me when we were in the same room and his face would light up if he entered a room an noticed I was there. Despite all this, it was rare for us to directly engage in conversation with each other, only participating in the same group conversations.

I noticed his interest and I felt (feel) an attraction to him, but didn't act on it during my time at the lab. There were several reasons for this. Most importantly, I felt really depressed during my internship had no confidence, lost my sense of self and had too little energy and confidence to be social (also a reason why we never directly talked). I think this also made any romantic attraction I felt less intense. My mental state ultimately led me to the decision to quit my internship and start working part-time instead. Additionally, I was unsure how I felt about our age difference. Lastly, I don't have any experience romantically so I wasn't sure how to approach in the first place.

My internship ended in May. Now months later, I cannot get him out of my head and my attraction towards him has only increased. I really want to talk to him and get to know him better. Everytime I spot him around campus I feel a rush. It's rare for me to be interested in anyone, let alone be attracted to somebody in this way and it feels impossible to not act upon.

However, I have no way to contact him other than Slack and his work email and running into him is difficult because the research lab offices are at a different floor of the university building. I know he goes to get lunch at the cafeteria everyday but eats it in the research lab break room.  Sometimes I see him arrive at campus in the morning but he leaves very late in the evening. 

Ideally, I would run into him accidentally and we could start some small talk and I could give him my number. Realistically, this is unlikely to happen naturally. I could approach him via his work email or Slack but this feels slightly inappropriate to do and I'm not sure what I could even tell him (ask to have a coffee sometimes or directly offer my number).

**How should I approach this, and is it even worth reaching out after months?**

That's 100 lbs down from December 31, 2024, I recently passed my 46th birthday, I was 6'3"" and I weighed 325 lbs. I never imagined I could lose 100 lbs in 318 days. That's 0.314 lbs per day. 

On December 31, I went to the ER with a kidney stone I had been dealing with for about a week, and it became intolerable. After getting triaged, the ER doctor asked me, ""What medication are you taking to treat your diabetes?"" I responded, ""Treat my what now?"" And he said, ""Your blood glucose is 330. You have diabetes. You need to discuss this with your primary care physician."" So, at 46 I had to establish a primary care physician. 

My primary care physician (PCP) put me on metformin, and we tried to get Mounjaro. It took 5 weeks to navigate the prior authorization paperwork. I started taking Mounjaro February 7. I radically changed my diet as soon as I got home from the ER, and, over those 5 weeks, I managed to lose 7 lbs. My A1C started out at 10.2, and within 90 days it was at 6.2, and I had lost an additional 38 lbs. Putting me at 280, and the first time in nearly 30 years that I was under 300 lbs. 

I did 4 weeks on 2.5 mg and 4 weeks on 5 mg, then stayed on 7.5 for 16 weeks. I've been on 10 mg since July 25. When I started on 10 mg, I weighed 258 lbs. Today, 16 weeks later, I now weigh 225. 

For my diet, I started out by changing what I ate, and then, as I progressed month by month, week by week, I reduced how much I ate. Firstly, I only ate chicken breasts, romaine lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, tomatoes, cottage cheese, individually wrapped 1 oz cheeses. Initially, I ate as much of these as I wanted, but I only ate from these choices. After 5 weeks of this diet change, and starting Mounjaro, I began portion control. I began weighing what I was eating, not to control how much I ate, but to understand how much I ate. And upon starting Mounjaro, I immediately noticed my satiety was significantly improved, and my hunger was much more quickly abated. 

After 4 weeks on 2.5 mg, I shifted from measuring for data collection purposes to measuring and weighing for portion control. I began making my salads with 200 grams of lettuce, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and chicken breast, 2 tbsp of salad dressing, and some olives and capers. For breakfast I would eat either 2 boiled eggs or 150 grams of cottage cheese. I maintained this rigor for my 4 weeks on 5.0 mg. My goal was to eat 1,650 calories a day. 

When I started on 7.5 mg, I was about 3 months into my weight loss journey, and 2 months on Mounjaro. From the beginning of May and on, my diet was on lockdown. My new challenge was not limiting what I ate, but eating enough. on 7.5 mg, if I ate ""when I felt hungry"" I would barely eat 1,200 calories a day. 

In June, I started going to a CrossFit gym. I went a little less than once a week for the whole month of May. In July, I committed to once a week and to try for twice a week. I'd do Monday and then try for Thursday or Friday, depending on my recovery. I also started being concerned about my protein intake with my significantly reduced intake. So I started buying 30 gram protein drinks. For a month, I drank 1 a day, at breakfast, mixed with equal parts coffee. This became my sole breakfast over time. I'd just make the coffee, no cottage cheese, and drink my protein coffee. 

In July I tried to get into the gym twice a week for sure. I didn't quite make it to twice a week. In August I stepped up to committing to 2 times a week. You should be getting the pattern here. In September I tried for 2.5 a week, and in October I committed to going to classes 3 times a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. 

This has been my journey. I am down 100 lbs. I weigh less today than I have since I graduated high school 30 years ago. I was 16 the last time my weight was this low. 

I hope to lose another 30 lbs. I want to get to 195 to see what that's like. I haven't seen what this looks like in my entire adult life. I feel better than I have in over a decade, and maybe 2 decades.

I need recommendations for some premium espresso machines! I currently have a Nespresso capsule machine and after awhile I decide that it's time to upgrade to a more legit one. I am looking at fully automatic machines. There are many brands and I am unsure if they are any differences. Quality is my top concern as I drink coffee at least once a day.

What are the differences b/w de'Longhi, Breville, JURA, Philips, Cafe? They all look pretty similar with similar price points. And then there are also options of Smeg, KitchenAid, Ninja. I know that de'Longhi and Breville are largely considered the go to brand for premium machines - but are they really that much better? Or is it just marketing?

I know some brands offer customer services or even latte classes - are those just gimmicks or truly useful for people who are serious about coffees?

I think 2 or maybe even 3 days after my last post my world changed. It sounds funny considering everything I have been through in the last 14 months. I was sitting with my brother, having coffee. My mother was at the store with my daughter and my father was cooking. Everything was perfectly normal, just as it should be. I talked with my older son after school when he messaged me to say he was going home with Melody and that he would change clothes, grab something to eat and then head to football practice. I replied and told him I would call him when he got back home. My younger son has been training in a different group since September so now every day one of them has practice but no longer together since they are in different age categories. 

I called him when he got home and he told me everything was fine. He wasn’t very talkative and said he was going to take a shower and then head over to his friend’s place who is actually our neighbour since he lives just one street away. I didn’t want to keep him so I told him we would talk before bedtime and we ended the call.

So there I was, drinking coffee with my brother, chatting with him and my father when suddenly my son’s coach called me. I thought it was strange but ofc I answered. He immediately started apologizing for bothering me but said he was worried about where my older son was. Since about an hour had passed since the end of practice I couldn’t understand why he was asking me that. He then told me that he hadn’t seen anyone pick up my son and that he seemed really nervous so he just wanted to make sure everything was okay. I told him that my son was already home and that Melody had picked him up as she often does when I am busy with work or too tired. That is when he told me that my son had gotten into a fight during practice and suggested I talk to him...saying he hoped my son had calmed down by now.

After I asked what had happened, he explained that my son had started pushing and wrestling with a boy who is actually a very good friend of his. That boy often comes to our house, my son goes to his, they go to the same school even though not the same class and I would say they are really close friends. I know his parents, my wife also. During the shoving, two other boys came over and attacked my son, while another boy also a good friend of my son has tried to defend him. When the coaches and other kids finally separated them, my son ran toward the boy he had first started pushing with and punched him few times in the mouth, splitting his lip and apparently even injuring his nose a little bit. I was completely shocked...mostly because as I said, that boy is truly a good friend of my son.

After that, coach told him to cool off and go sit on the bench. My son protested, saying that this boy had insulted him but when the coaches still told him to sit down and calm himself he started yelling at them saying he would never come back again and apparently stormed off to the locker room. The coach thought he was sitting there but when practice ended he couldn’t find him because my son had already changed his clothes and left the field. You know that my son had that incident at school before but it was proven that he was the victim in that situation and had only defended himself. Other than that, he has never had problems like this and what happens with him and my younger son is a different story at the end...

I told him I would call my son right away and ask him about it since he hadn’t mentioned anything to me and that I would call him later. However, my son didn’t answer my calls. So I called my wife and asked if he was still at home or if he had gone to his friend’s place. She said he had gone out and I told her to go get him immediately and to call me as soon as she brought him home. She started to panic, asking what had happened but I told her it was nothing serious and that I just needed to talk to him. While I was waiting for her, I called Melody and asked if he had said anything to her. She told me that he was quiet in the car and didn’t talk to her at all and that he was already been waiting on the bench by the entrance of the training complex which was strange because usually she has to wait for him to finish fooling around with his friends after training. When she asked him what he was doing there, he said that practice had ended early.

He finally called me and asked what I needed. I asked him what had happened. In the meantime, I realized my wife was trying to listen what we are talking about so I became furious at her. When we were finally able to talk properly he told me that he had hit his friend because the boy had insulted him. He didn’t want to tell me what exactly was said but after I pressed him then he finally admitted that the boy told him my wife/his mother has a new boyfriend and that my son would end up alone. Apparently, It wasn’t the first time he said something like that and he made similar comments several times over the past few weeks. To be honest, I thought I was going to faint at that moment. I was completely speechless. He wasn’t saying much either. I asked him for details like when the boy first said this, whether he had replied, if they had been arguing before…I could see how much it was affecting my son and that is when he started crying and asked me to come home. My son only cries when he is hurt, like if he gets injured or when Barcelona loses in the last minute like against Inter last year in the CL...other than that, he doesn’t cry. But this time...he cried a lot and said he really missed me and his sister and that he wished we would come home. I immediately told him that I would call him and that we would come back ASAP. 

And so, for the next two hours...I was in total shock. My wife was sending messages asking what had happened. My son went to sleep without eating or doing his homework...he went to bed at 7 PM...I looked at flight tickets...it was thursday and the fastest I could get home was leaving friday afternoon and arriving saturday afternoon local time. I bought the tickets immediately, told my daughter we were going home and explained to my family what had happened. I called the coach and told him I knew everything but I would explain it another time. I apologized and told him my son would return to training next week. He thanked me and that was it regarding him. I called my wife and told her that our son had a fight with a friend...asking her not to bother him or call the boy’s mother. I didn’t tell her the full truth because who knows how she would react if she knew what really happened while I wasn’t there. I explained the situation to Melody and told her we were coming back. To be honest, in that moment I wanted to kill my wife. Fortunately for her and I can honestly say also for me, I was away at that moment. If I had been at home, it wouldn’t have mattered whether she was suicidal or not. I would throw her away from the balcony.

And then some fucking idiots from Reddit and even some from my life come to me and say that this is all something between me and my wife and that the kids shouldn’t be involved…and that she is a great mother who just made a mistake because everyone makes mistakes, right? Anyone who thinks like that is such a damn idiot!!! I don’t even know how else to describe a person who can say something like that. All of you who write things like that act like you are some kind of online therapists and ofc the smartest people ever and like you are the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, preaching peace and love…but you have no idea what life is really like. Situations like this can’t be solved by following some textbook instructions. Younger son has been crying for a year, older son is going through being teased at school and being told he will be left alone and that his mother has a boyfriend. But this is supposed to be “a matter between me and her”??? The kids don’t get a say at all?? I am supposed to be nice to her for the sake of the kids and somehow I am the one hurting them??? Well fuck you all!!! I hope all of you will be cheated on! I hope all of you will have the same situation with the kids as I have. And then you can preach your nonsense about being a bigger person and how I should be civil to my wife because this is just between me and her. Fucking idiots, nothing else. 

Okay, back to the story…After that, I called the mother of that boy. She acted dumb, pretending that her son had just told her he got hurt in a duel and that is why his lip was split. I wanted to know where that kid got that information about my wife and how he even found out. Again, she acted clueless which made me sure at that moment that she somehow knew. There are multiple possibilities. Maybe someone from school told her…My wife made a scene two days after Dday and the principal, both of my sons’ homeroom teachers, school psychologist, secretary, those two bitches from CPS and two security guards saw it. Maybe someone else...but honestly, I don’t remember. I thought maybe my son said something to that boy…or maybe my stupid wife had told her something even though they were never friends. Then she said something like ""idk, maybe he heard something…I will talk to him.” At that moment, everything became clear to me and I told her that if I ever see her or her son near me or my kids that I would break their legs and arms. I don’t feel any remorse for saying that so don’t even bother judging me for it. Idc about that kid or anyone else to he honest when it comes to the safety and well being of my children. She then asked me if that was a threat and I told her it was. She said she would call the police and I told her to go ahead. What could she do? It would be my word against hers even though she is a local so honestly...her word would carry more weight to be fair but idgaf.

Her husband, who is from the UK, called me the next day and asked what had happened. He swore that he didn’t know anything about it but apologized on behalf of his son and wife and said he would make sure his son apologized to mine and that he would never say anything like that again. Boy did apologize, but as far as I know, my son literally told him to get the fuck off from him and to leave him alone. During the trip back, I had already calmed down and was feeling better mentally. My wife thought the whole time that my daughter and I were still in my country and since she hadn’t spoken to her the night before, I told her that my daughter was already asleep. 

When we got back, my wife and MIL were in shock. She kept questioning me why we came, why we hadn’t called, what was happening…I told her it was a surprise but ofc...she didn’t believe me. My older son was genuinely happy…younger one was more neutral even though I can say he was at least glad to see his sister and they were both laughing with her. Very quickly, I called my older son into my room to talk and that is when he told me everything. 

I will forget a lot of things since it happened almost 20 days ago…but basically, he knows everything. During Dday, he heard my wife crying on the phone, probably recording voice messages for me where she said she only loved me and not AP. He says he didn’t tell anyone about this, not even my younger son. That boy first mentioned it to him about a month ago while they were playing at his house. Supposedly, he immediately called me to come get him…to be honest, I don’t even remember that day or that situation or the drive, so I can’t say much about it. He’s the only boy who tells him these things. At school, boy mentioned it to him several times and other kids laughed at him. During training, he brought it up again and that is when my son hit him even though he says he wanted to hit him at school already. He asked me who AP is, if I know him. Then he said something very confusing...asking if AP was the husband of one of my female friends. I asked him where he got that from and he said it seemed like he heard the same name during Dday…Honestly, AP and that man have completely different names, so I have no idea where he got that. Not really important. He asked me many other things…do I love her, will we stay together… He said he didn’t want to talk about this before because he saw how hard it was for me after that day. He asked if she was still in contact with AP and if I had ever met him in person…Basically, he was curious about all the details and I told him everything exactly as it was.

He didn’t cry. He was very composed and spoke normally while my blood pressure was probably 800/400. After everything, I asked him to honestly tell me his opinion about his mother and he said that he feels sorry when he sees her cry but that he would never leave me…something along those lines. I really can’t quote him exactly but it was something similar. He also said he was angry that she hurt me like that and that she thought someone else was better than me…Honestly, I didn’t have answers for him. I just said I needed some time alone and that I would come to him later and told him to go to his room. A few minutes after this, I vomited from the nausea for the first time since Dday. I felt like I did when I was seriously ill and ended up in the hospital…if I had a gun near me, I probably would have blown my brains out in that moment. I am 36 yo and I am talking with my son, who will turn 10 in two months about why his mother fucked some other dude. There is no lower point in life than this...

After I calmed down, I called Melody to come and take the kids into town. I waited and waited for her and finally when she arrived and left with the children, I had time to talk to my wife and MIL. My wife had a look on her face as if I was about to hand her divorce papers and she was visibly shaken. That is when I told her everything. I won’t go into too many details because it is not important…but my MIL just held her hands over her mouth in shock and my wife just stared at me with a few tears. She didn’t say a single word after I told her everything. I felt like the little bit of soul she had, had left her body. This went on for a few minutes until she just got up and went to her room. My MIL followed her and there was a lot of shouting in their language, so I don’t know what they were saying to each other. I left the house and went for a walk because I felt like I was going to die…about two hours later, my MIL called me and told me to come home because my wife was asleep. I realized she had given her sleeping pills…It was then that my MIL told me that my wife had said she was going to kill herself and that nothing else mattered to her. That she didn’t care whether she stayed married to me or if we would divorce…nothing mattered...this was supposedly the end for her and she intended to take her life at the first opportunity. 

Anyway, my MIL started begging me to call a psychiatrist immediately and take her for treatment. I called her psychiatrist and he told me to contact one private clinic and mention that he had referred me and that he would also call them to provide his professional assessment. It was already around 9 or 10 PM so we couldn’t reach the doctors we needed and we were told to call on monday unless it became an absolute emergency. Her psychiatrist told me he had sent an email to the clinic with his evaluation of her mental state. That is when I wondered what the hell I was supposed to do with her all sunday in this condition…MIL and I decided to do everything we could to persuade her to agree to voluntary treatment, even if it meant lying to her and promising her everything if she agrees. MIL stayed in the room with my wife whole night and I told her that when my wife wakes up, she should call me immediately so that we could take care of her and talk to her together. I asked Melody to be there with us on sunday, at least to cook lunch for the children and she agreed without any problem. When my wife woke up after about good 10 hours of sleep, she immediately started yelling that she was going to kill herself because our son hates her and that she couldn’t bear this pain and that we should let her do it.

At that moment, I had to intervene and I hugged her while she was crying and screaming…MIL went out and stayed with the kids while my wife and I lay on her bed. She started apologizing again, saying she couldn’t live with this pain and that she had done this to her children…after a few hours of lying there, I managed to convince her to take pills again and she fell asleep once more. When she woke up in the evening, she tried to talk to our son but MIL stopped her. Then we spoke with her and I told her that he doesn’t hate her and that there is a chance to reconcile with him. It was a very long conversation so there is no point in telling every detail but MIL and I told her that if she ever wants her children to be happy and love her and if she loves them and if she loves me she has to agree to treatment. I told her that the children want it, I want it, MIL wants it, Nam wants it, my mother wants it…and that there is no other option. I gave her my promise that MIL and I would visit her every day and that she wouldn’t be there long. After a good 2, 3 hours of conversation, she just shrugged and said OK. 

I can’t describe the relief I felt then. It was like a whole mountain had fallen off my shoulders. We somehow got through the rest of the night with her crying, yelling, then silence, then crying again…Kids went to school and kindergarten with Melody. About an hour later, I called the clinic and was told to come immediately. Honestly, it was extremely hard for me at that moment. I felt like I was taking her to prison for a life sentence. Seeing her crying while she puts her shoes on…it was hard for real. At the reception, we were greeted by a nurse who gave me such a strange feeling. A young woman, a foreigner...and she kept looking only at my wife. I was giving all the information and she just nodded and stared at my wife while another nurse was taking notes…I wish I knew what she was thinking…my wife looked like zombie in that moment and was talking so much nonsense.

And so they took us into the office while my wife was in a separate room. We spoke with two doctors and the head nurse. I explained everything. Told them everything. One of the doctors told me that he had read a message from her psychiatrist and could roughly anticipate what was going on with her but that they would first conduct an initial assessment. They would keep her for the day and starting tomorrow they will test her for bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety…etc. and examine her cognitive functions. He also told us that we wouldn’t be able to see her today and that they needed my signature while she had already signed. We exchanged numbers, shook hands, MIL was crying like rain and the nurse stayed with us for informations and payment. After I had written everything down, we left and honestly...I shed a few tears myself. I am usually very cold when it comes to crying and only cry when someone dies. I felt absolutely awful at that moment and MIL and I stood in the car for a good 20 minutes. I just kept asking myself if God exists…why this happened…why she did this. From the happiest couple we once were, we ended up here…

The rest of the day was a total mess and I only received a notification that my wife was under “treatment.” Younger son reacted very badly when he found out she wasn’t there. MIL helped a lot. Older son was acting strange and the daughter too… basically, it was awful. I told them she had gone on a trip, that she would be back soon and that they would hear from her very soon. Honestly, maybe this was an even worse day for me than Dday. Idk… back then I was still in shock and not fully aware of everything...but this…I felt so empty and powerless in a way. Honestly idk how to explain. 

The next day we arrived at the hospital in the morning and were told that she would be hospitalized for an indefinite period. On the first day, they took blood tests, liver and kidney tests and much more…because of the medications they plan to give her. They have already tested her for everything I had mentioned and told me that they are waiting for the overall results but there are no signs of bipolar disorder, although she has severe depression, anxiety, trauma and the highest level of suicidality and she has been in a state of psychosis for some time. So she wasn't faking...doctor told me that her cognitive test results are poor. The following day, they focused on her suicidal thoughts and her feelings of guilt for everything she has done. They did not want to put her in group therapy because she is not ready for it. They told me that they are monitoring her behaviour and that I can visit her the next day. I spoke with her boss and told him that she would be hospitalized and he wished her all the best but told me that he has the right to terminate her employment in this case. Honestly, I am not sure if he actually has but he said he would pay her everything she was owed and wished both her and me good luck. He also said that once she recovers, she can contact him again regarding work if a position becomes available. 

I realized that ever since I stopped paying her bills, she changed her insurance for some reason and her new insurance doesn’t cover the mental health portion. So, for her daily treatment, room and medication, I am paying roughly 500 usd per day when converted from the local currency. It is like she booked a stay at a fucking Hilton…and she can stay up to 90 days...so that is 45 000 usd in that scenario...because she wanted to fuck some other guy...The first time I saw her was 3 days after she was admitted to the hospital. She looked like a ghost. Completely drained of energy, under medication…she only asked me how I was and how the children were. MIL came in after me and found it very hard to cope. I tried to ask her basic questions but she only answered very briefly, as if she had no strength. After the visit, doctor told me that they concluded my wife is suffering from severe depression, anxiety, the highest level of suicidality and trauma. He said the trauma comes from the time she found out I had moved on…specifically regarding Sung. He mentioned that hospitalization would be necessary for at least one month and that he had already started speaking with her on a daily basis. They are monitoring her mood and sleep changes and have started giving her medication for depression and anxiety while keeping an eye on possible side effects. He said this is a marathon and that they need to be careful with patients like her. 

I won’t recount every single day…but basically, I visited her every day. MIL did not. She said it was just too hard for her to see her in that state. In monday, after 7 days, my wife spoke to the children on the phone. She told them she loved them. Honestly, I saw progress and she seemed much better than in the first few days. Doctor told me that she had started individual therapy and was receiving mood stabilizers and that he was satisfied with how she was responding to the medication. This week, she started more detailed evaluations for all of her diagnoses. She also began attending group therapy. They started investigating her psychotic symptoms and the doctor told me that they would focus on that. I talked with her a lot and she seemed really well. She even laughed at some situations I told her about. She spoke with the children every day. MIL came to see her daily this week. Overall, she looked much better in every way.

However, today hasn’t been good. Doctor told me that her conversations with him and the psychologist haven’t led to progress in her thinking. In other words, she cannot face the realization that our marriage is over. When she is on her medication, she responds well but without it, she reverts to her old patterns. They are now considering whether to change her medication or increase the dosage. Their assessment is that she is definitely not able to take care of the children or even herself. When she talks with me and MIL she seems really okay. To me, it seems similar to how she used to appear at home when she was alright. But the doctors say she is nowhere near mentally healthy...

In the past days and weeks, I have been thinking a lot, really a lot about everything…First of all, I have been considering whether to transfer my son to a different school and at the same time my younger son as well. I looked into how much it would cost me to pay penalties for this school year, lose the deposits for both sons and pay for both sons’ school year at the new International school...and honestly my lifestyle wouldn’t change if I do this even though amount is very big. So, money isn’t the problem and I am ready to do it but both of them tell me they don’t want it but I think older son wants it, he just doesn’t want to tell me…also I went to immigration and spoke with a serious official there who gave me a lot of useful informations. My wife will not have problems regarding her visa even though she ended up in psychiatry. However, since her employment was terminated then she will need to change her visa. I provided a confirmation from the hospital that she is under treatment and I was told that once her treatment is finished, she has a legal period of 7 days to change her visa back to a family visa within the country.

I also asked them about how everything will proceed regarding the divorce and her visa after all of this. They told me that if I plan a divorce and I want her to stay in the country, she would need to change her visa to a guardian visa in relation to our children. The conditions are that she must have a certain monthly income and certain amount in the local currency in her account for 2 months (basically deposit) and after that she can apply for this visa. This deposit can never be touched and must always remain in the account. The problem is that she will almost certainly not find a job with her qualifications. Guy told me that if she switches to this visa, immigration will follow her income very carefully and she won’t be able to get a job because she doesn’t have the education required for any jobs that foreigners do here not even her previous one. This means I would basically have to support her financially after divorce. 

But the worst part of all is that I was told that in any case where I have majority custody she will have major difficulties obtaining a guardian visa and everything then depends on the judge, who can issue a special permit for her stay in the country. However, immigration may then impose an additional requirement on her, which is usually employment…and without qualifications, with a record of psychiatric treatment…her chances are minimal, which was confirmed to me by the guy I spoke with. So now, after all of this, to file for divorce, I have to wait at least 2 months and give her nice amount of money to keep in an account. Only when she obtains the new visa I can file for divorce if I don’t want her to be deported. And if I want her to stay in the country, I would somehow have to perform a miracle and find her a job (and even then it is not guaranteed that she can stay) or agree to share custody 50/50, which is not an option in my eyes…

So, that is it. I am keeping track of her recovery. I am glad she looks better and is no longer like a ghost. My BIL asks about her every day and stays in touch with me and with MIL. My FIL isn’t interested in anything and has basically deleted her from his life. Kids are doing better. My days are spent at home->psychiatric clinic->taking them from school and to practices–>home. I rarely see Sung but we keep in touch. I practically don’t see anyone, only those who visit me at home. I don’t go anywhere…that is how I live and that is it. I plan to return to work in monday. I am in contact with my boss and everything is fine. As always, take care.",26,1763132104.0,u_OutrageousSpread8706,12,1.0,False
1owymgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1owymgo/i_made_a_deal_in_a_diner/,I made a deal in a diner,"Something about a greasy old diner in a small town had a way of bringing me back down to earth. Maybe it was the ambience of the sizzling food in the kitchen combined with the clatter of plates on dilapidated tables. Perhaps it was the scent of warm coffee paired with the kind of burger you could never find anywhere else. Nothing fancy or even that good. Just warm and greasy enough to be comfortable. Maybe it was childhood memories of eating with my family at places not so different from this one. Whatever it was, there I sat, wishing I could sit in this cozy little vestige of Americana forever, or at least until my life got started, cuz it seemed like I couldn’t start it on my own.

   I grew up in a small town like this. I left for college, got a music degree, and found a job in retail. I’ve been trying for a few years to make music my job, specifically as a pianist. I’ve done some session work, toured with a couple local artists, but never found anything that seemed to stick, and for the most part have felt sort of lost ever since graduating. Now I was on my to a neighboring city to see about a job as a music teacher. It wasn’t exactly what I envisioned for myself. Then again what did I think I’d really be doing with a music degree? Featuring on a Taylor Swift top ten hit? Composing the soundtrack for Star Wars XXII? This though, seems like pretty realistic work for me. At least I could put my degree to good use. Still, it felt like I wasted so much time just for a measly teaching gig. I’d give about anything for a shot at something more real.

   I stared out the window while I waited for my food, watching the storm clouds gather over the small town. Before long the rain started to fall. The sound of the downpour matched the sizzling in the kitchen. It was almost enough to make me nod off. I heard the bell of the door ring, followed by footsteps approaching.

   “Scuse me sir,” said an upbeat voice behind me, “Mind if I sit here?”

   I looked up and saw a tall lanky man. It was an odd request considering that there were plenty of seats available, although all the window seats were taken by larger crowds. I figured I’d humor him. “Feel free,” I told him. He sat across from me and picked up a menu. 

   “Whaddya say?” He asked, “The burger, or the chicken fried steak?”

   “I couldn’t tell you. This my first stop here. But I ordered the cheeseburger anyway.”

   “The fried steak then,” he said folding the menu back up. “Oh waitress!” He called.

   “Ready to order hun?” said a voice behind me, only it didn’t belong to the waitress. In fact it was the same voice as that of the man in front of me. I looked up and saw the same tall, lanky man. Only instead of the suit the man in front of me wore, he was in the waitress’s outfit. I looked the man, then at the “waitress”, then back again. The man gave his order and his double left. I stared at the man dumbfounded, gesturing behind me, my mouth not finding the words to speak. So the man spoke for me.

   “I know right?” He smirked, “I really do pull off that skirt.”

   I looked around the whole restaurant. My jaw fell to the floor when I saw that every patron now had the same face as the man in front of me. “Who are you?” I finally asked.

   “My buddies call me Stan.” He extended a hand. “Are we buddies Martin?”

   “How do you-“, I cut myself off, it wasn’t as important as my next question. “Where do you come from?”

   “Down south,” he shrugged, “I’m not too popular in the Bible Belt though, so here I am.” His coffee was brought out and his took a sip of it and smiled. “I’ve been around a bit, but tell me Martin, why does no coffee compare to a diner cup with milk and sugar?”

   “What do you mean down south?” I asked, almost hoping he wouldn’t answer.

   “Oh Martin,” he raised an eyebrow. “Now don’t go and act all coy with me, I think you know.”

   I had an idea or two of what he was implying, but even after seeing all that I had just now, I needed a little more confirmation. Or I would if I wanted to hear this psycho out. Instead I ran to the door, but when I opened it, rather than a rainy street, I saw something that will haunt my dreams and my waking hour for years to come. An endless ashen landscape. A dark haze hung low, so that I couldn’t see the sky, assuming there was one. I heard a terrible sound in the distance. Voices. It sounded like thousands of voices shrieking and weeping simultaneously. I let the glass door close. The window still showed the rainy street side. That was more confirmation than I wanted. 

   “Sir, please don’t leave the restaurant until your check’s been paid,” said waitress Stan.

   I walked back to my table. Stan was slicing into his fried steak. “Yep,” he said, “I say y’all folks up north complain about global warming too much. I mean I’ve lived in heat you would not believe. And I got no a/c.”

   “Well what do you want with me?”

   “Not a lot really. I just thought I might be able to help you out a little.”

   “What with?”

   “What with? What do you think dipshit? You’re on your way to interview for a prestigious position teaching the grateful youth the art of music making all for an incredibly rewarding salary I’m sure. Or maybe you want more out of life.”

   “Of course I want more, and sure I’ve been floundering in my field for years, but I’m sure once I have some stability, I can find something a little more rewarding.”

   “Well I’m sure a driven focused young man such as yourself will have no problem finding that big break. But then again…” He looked at the door as the bell rang again. I watched as someone that wasn’t Stan walked in. He seemed familiar somehow. He was old, probably in his eighties. The way he spoke to the server sounded so close to home. It was me. He, or I, droned on about finally being close to retiring from teaching. 

   I turned back to Stan. “I know what you’re doing, but that doesn’t have to be me.”

   “No of course you’re right it doesn’t. But it is certainly possible. Probable even. Once you get into a bland but comfortable rut, it can be extremely difficult to escape it. It can be difficult to even want to. Do you want to want that life, Martin?”

   “No,” I relented, “I don’t. I really don’t. But that doesn’t mean I’d want to sell myself.”

   Stan laughed, “Martin, Martin, Martin! That’s not what I’m asking for no, no, no!”

   “Then what do you want?”

   “A shard.”

   “What?”

   “Just that. A small shard of a soul. So small you wouldn’t even notice it’s gone.”

   “And what would I get in exchange?”

   “Several years. Several years of success in whatever endeavor you pursue. You want to produce the next big hit? It’s yours. Play your own songs before grand crowds? You can. Still wanna teach? You can at the most prestigious universities, instead of babysitting inattentive brats. Whatever you set your mind to, success will come.”

   “At when the time is up, what then? Back to retail?”

   “Not necessarily. Your fate is entirely in your hands after that. Maybe you’ll be able to maintain your fortune, or achieve even greater heights, who knows Martin?”

Along those lines, I know that there was a weekly gathering at Vertex Coffee Roasters in Ypsilanti at 10:00 a.m. on Saturdays. Can anybody confirm that such a meet-up is still ongoing? Is there a contact person who is in charge of this, or is it just an informal gathering happening 

And if it is, rather than re-invent the wheel, it may behoove us in the area to rally around that weekly event. What say you?

Furthermore, I'd love to know if any other region in our state--or close-by in Ohio, Indiana, and possibly even Chicagoland--currently holds such gatherings.

If not, I'd love to see if we can get such gatherings going throughout the state.

If we can, we can keep a current list of these events on our home page and update as needed.

Just spitballing, but if we can create such a network of small, regional events, perhaps we can work towards an annual summer meet-up. Perhaps a picnic in a park in a centrally-located part of Michigan. 

I believe such a laid-back, non-pot luck-style, event would be a fantastic ""team-building,"" or in our case, ""group-building"" exercise. 

Heck, if we got a big enough turn-out for a picnic, we might even get some musicians to show up and entertain us! I know--I'm getting ahead of things. But I've found it always helps to have aspirations and goals. 

Thanks to everyone here, but especially to those among us who are willing to make an effort to help create the sort of close-knit community that we deserve.

----

# Extra Deep Summary: Douglas Macgregor on Ukraine's Twilight

## Overview
This 44-minute interview features Colonel Douglas Macgregor (Ret.) providing a sweeping, historically-grounded analysis of the Ukraine war's endgame, military paradigm shifts, and institutional failures within the U.S. and NATO. Larry Johnson frames Macgregor as one of the last ""dissident voices"" allowed on mainstream media to objectively discuss Russian capabilities. The conversation moves beyond daily headlines to examine foundational military philosophy, cultural hubris, and why the West has fundamentally misread this conflict.

---

## **I. The Death of Maneuver Warfare & Rise of the Drone Paradigm**

**Core Thesis**: Macgregor argues that drones have rendered traditional maneuver warfare obsolete, creating a paradigm shift the West refuses to acknowledge.

**Maneuver Warfare Defined**: The concept of achieving positional advantage—moving forces to assert superior power, either for standoff strikes or direct fire confrontation. Macgregor contends this has largely been theoretical for Western armies.

**America's True Identity—A Firepower Army**: Despite rhetoric, Macgregor insists the U.S. has *never* been a maneuver army. He traces this back to WWII:
- **Normandy Breakout**: Not maneuver but ""linear"" advance dependent on thousands of aircraft and artillery batteries pulverizing German positions. ""We lined up the guns... and blasted the living daylights out of the Germans until they left.""
- **Generational Failure**: WWI generals (like Montgomery) dominated WWII thinking, imposing static, firepower-intensive tactics rather than dynamic maneuver.
- **Marine Corps & British Similarity**: All Anglo-American forces share this firepower DNA, contrasting with German historical mastery of true maneuver.

**Russia's Firepower Tradition**: Russia's approach is historically consistent—massive investment in artillery and standoff weapons. Macgregor references James Billington's *The Icon and the Axe*, noting Napoleon's shock at encountering Russian artillery superiority. The pattern: Russians may not maneuver well, but they concentrate overwhelming fire.

**The Drone Revolution**: Simplicius the Substack writer correctly identified that drones ended maneuver warfare. Macgregor emphasizes this isn't just about individual drones but a **new connectivity paradigm**:
- **ISR-Strike Integration**: Overhead (satellite) and terrestrial surveillance directly linked to dispersed, masked strike systems—not hub-to-hub like WWII, but networked.
- **Force Dispersion**: Units no longer hold static fronts; they disperse, concentrate fire, then disperse again, making them nearly impossible to target.
- **Fiber-Optic Drones**: Russia's new drones carry spools of fiber-optic cable (40+ km range, now extending further) to defeat jamming—technology Macgregor says the U.S. hasn't replicated.

---

## **II. The Three Phases of Russia's War Adaptation**

### **Phase 1: The ""Twilight Zone"" (February-March 2022)**
Macgregor reveals Putin's initial orders created a catastrophic hesitation: *""Don't shoot anyone... minimize damage, don't cover the Ukrainians.""* Russian generals wanted to strike barracks preemptively; Putin refused, believing Ukrainians were ""Slavic Orthodox Christians"" who would understand and negotiate. This explains the infamous 40-mile tank column north of Kiev—sitting vulnerable but not destroyed because Ukrainians couldn't coordinate effective strikes. By April 2022, Macgregor told Laura Ingraham: *""The Ukrainians are being crushed,""* despite mainstream media declaring Ukrainian victory.

### **Phase 2: ""Democracy in Action"" (Summer 2022)**
The turning point was a failed southern operation near Heron. Two battalions of Russian airborne troops suffered heavy casualties. The soldiers **wrote letters directly to Putin and newspapers**, demanding their commander's removal for incompetence—failure to establish artillery connectivity, inadequate preparation. **The commander was removed.** Macgregor calls this ""democracy in action,"" contrasting it with the U.S. military's culture of concealing incompetence. From that point, the Russian military began genuinely listening to battlefield feedback.

### **Phase 3: Strategic Elasticity & the German WWI Model (Late 2022-Present)**
Under General Sergey Surovikin, Russia implemented **strategic elasticity**:
- **Defense in Depth**: Multi-layered, fortified lines that are ""practically impenetrable.""
- **German WWI Parallel**: Germany's 1918 advance stopped at Latvia-Lithuania-Poland-Galicia because, as German commanders reasoned, *""What are we marching into Russia for? There's nothing there but Russians.""* They let Russia exhaust itself attacking prepared defenses, annihilating them through mass artillery. Russia is now doing to Ukraine what Germany did to Russia in WWI.
- **Invincibility**: Once this system was mature, Macgregor declares, *""The Russian army is on the path to victory. There's no question about it.""*

---

## **III. Institutional Decay: Why the West Can't Adapt**

### **A. The Herd of Cats: NATO's Fatal Flaw**
Drawing on 1980s research in Andy Marshall's Pentagon office (reading Soviet General Staff journals), Macgregor exposes NATO's core vulnerability:

**Soviet ""Unity of Effort""**:
- Every formation identically organized, trained, equipped.
- **One man in command** at every level (political officers marginalized by 1942-43).
- **Forced Integration**: Polish-speaking divisions existed, but no autonomous Polish corps. Everyone was ""Sovietized."" The Germans made the opposite mistake, letting Hungarian/Romanian/Italian allies operate independently—""more burden than asset.""

**NATO's Chaos**: 
- ""A herd of 16 cats."" Different languages, doctrines, training, equipment.
- No unified command structure. ""Eight cats won't even come through the door.""
- **""Death on the battlefield""**: This lack of uniformity is more fatal than any technology gap.

### **B. The U.S. Promotion Machine: Billy Bob & the Aides**
Macgregor's harshest critique targets U.S. general officer selection:

**Russia's Meritocracy**: After failed 2008 reforms, Putin created a **separate school for commanders** designed to ""sift out who was an idiot and who was competent."" The Russian General Staff nurtures ""high human capital"" with an ""eye for detail."" WWII commanders were ""long ball hitters""—battle-tested, steady under fire.

**America's ""Billy Bob"" System**: 
- Promote ""Billy Bob because he's a good guy and a real war fighter"" (sarcastic).
- **Aide-to-General Pipeline**: Pre-digested ""future great men"" who were aide-de-camp, executive officer, speechwriter.
- **No Tests**: No rigorous examination of competence.
- **Political Loyalty Over Skill**: Macgregor's 23 years scripting exercises for JFCOM/SOCOM showed politics trumping ability. He watched figures like General John Abizaid rise from lieutenant colonel to leadership roles without proper vetting.

### **C. The Cover-Up Culture vs. Russian Feedback**
- **U.S.**: Conceals gross incompetence (examples: Afghanistan withdrawal architect General Donahue; General Cavoli). The 101st Airborne's disastrous 2003 deep helicopter attack on Najaf—pilots ""looking for something they'd seen in a war game"" (2nd/3rd echelon Soviet armor) instead of reality—was covered up, not analyzed.
- **Russia**: After the Heron failure, the commander was publicly removed based on soldier feedback. This created a ""positive thing"" where battlefield voices were heard.

---

## **IV. Technological & Tactical Deep Dives**

### **The M1 Abrams Catastrophe**
Macgregor served with M1A1 tanks and calls the engine a ""catastrophe"":
- **Thermal Signature**: Burns at thousands of degrees, trackable by low-Earth orbit satellites since 1990.
- **Vulnerability**: 42 fluid connections; shake one loose, fluid hits engine, giant fire, engine destroyed.
- **Logistical Nightmare**: Refueling is hazardous—can't refuel near front lines without explosion risk. In the 1991 Gulf War, Macgregor's unit shut down engines during stops to conserve fuel, but most units refused from fear of being surprised (despite total air supremacy).
- **Post-War Neglect**: After Desert Storm, officers said ""we gotta get rid of these engines."" Nothing happened. Now Russia destroys them routinely.

### **The Russian Rotation System**
Macgregor observed a brilliant Russian innovation:
- **Brigade-Centric**: Brigade HQ remains the operational command.
- **Battalion Rotation**: Battalions rotate through the brigade area every 48-96 hours.
- **Result**: Maximum fresh troops, rested soldiers, while brigade leadership gains deep experience orchestrating the battle.

### **The Simulation Trap**
Macgregor recounts watching a National Training Center exercise with General Boyd Mares (artilleryman):
- **Laser Drill**: Little men with shoulder-fired lasers on boulders destroyed armor in the valley.
- **Mares' Reaction**: Shook his head. Macgregor told him: *""Good artillery would turn all those boulders into shrapnel with airburst. Why don't we simulate that?""*
- **Mares**: *""Absolutely right... We don't simulate that.""*
- **Lesson**: ""If you impart bad lessons, they tend to be internalized."" This explains why pilots in Iraq 2003 acted out war game fantasies instead of reality.

---

## **V. The Human Cost & Demographic Collapse**

**Pokrovsk Catastrophe**: The collapse there is ""very, very serious"" and misunderstood in the West. Russian soldiers report captured Ukrainians ""have only been in uniform for a week."" This is ""absurd"" and ""inhumane.""

**Population Exodus**: Former Ukrainian PM Mykola Azarov (2010-2014) told Johnson:
- 2010: 57 million Ukrainians in-country
- 2025: ~20 million
Macgregor's German sources confirm refugees have ""no intention of ever going back.""

**Moral Failure**: Washington's insistence on continuing the fight is ""inhumane."" Macgregor argues: *""Humanity demands an end to this. We've got to rescue whatever is left of the so-called Ukrainian nation before it's extinct.""*

---

## **VI. Historical Patterns of Hubris**

### **Underestimating Enemies—An American Tradition**
Macgregor traces a continuous thread of catastrophic arrogance:

**World War II**: Pre-Normandy briefings depicted Germans as ""robots"" who ""can't think"" and need orders—actually a better description of U.S. forces.

**Korea (1950)**: Major General William Dean (24th Infantry Division) said North Koreans would ""flee in disarray"" upon seeing Americans. In reality, North Koreans were Soviet-trained veterans of the war against Japan—""tough people, not pushovers.""

**Vietnam (1963)**: First MACV commander predicted VC wouldn't last a year, war over by January 1964.

**China (1950)**: MacArthur admitted to Ridgway he was wrong—Chinese forces in Korea were far better than WWII: ""They're infiltrating along ridgelines... not conducting mindless frontal assaults."" Ridgway learned; most didn't.

**Modern Ukraine**: Ben Hodges, David Petraeus, Mark Milley speak ""disrespectfully"" of Russian ""incompetence,"" while Russian generals (per Johnson's Moscow meetings) speak respectfully of U.S. capabilities.

---

## **VII. The Caribbean Deployment: A Microcosm of Overstretch**

Johnson asks about sustainability of U.S. forces in Trinidad & Tobago and Puerto Rico (the ""cocked hammer"").

**Macgregor's Assessment**: 6-8 weeks maximum before:
- **Replenishment Crisis**: At-sea replenishment only goes so far; ports needed.
- **Personnel Degradation**: Troops become ""slovenly and sloppy.""
- **Strategic Vulnerability**: Iran has already flown drones to Puerto Rico. Against a near-peer, *""Trinidad and Tobago would be in bad shape right now. Why wait around for these people to get their act together and attack?""*

**The Invisibility Delusion**: Russians operate in a world where ""there's no such thing as invisibility"" (constant drone/satellite surveillance). *""We still behave as though there is.""*

---

## **VIII. The Russian General Staff: A Professional Core**

**Historical Depth**: Under Tsars, Russia sought ""high human capital"" for command. The Soviets improved on this, creating a General Staff system as good as Germany's.

**The ""Long Ball Hitters""**: After massive WWII losses, the Soviets identified commanders with ""steadiness of nerve and character"" to stay and fight. For major offensives (e.g., destruction of Army Group Center), they assembled the very best commanders and staff officers—a meritocratic ""all-star team.""

**Modern Practice**: Putin's post-2008 reform failed, so they pivoted: created a separate commander school to filter idiots. This produced the current General Staff, which Macgregor rates as highly skilled, intelligent, and detail-oriented.

**U.S. Failure**: No equivalent. Joint Chiefs are ""a domestic version of NATO""—political, not professional.

---

## **IX. The Endgame: Victory & Denial**

**Ukrainian Collapse**: The front is ""in ruins."" Captured soldiers march in ""endless columns."" Many had only one week of training. Fortress cities are falling.

**Western Delusion**: Petraeus now says Russians are ""good at combined arms warfare."" Macgregor: *""This guy's stuck in 1942. This is a totally different brand, a new paradigm.""*

**The Unspeakable Truth**: *""Whatever the Russians want it to look like"" is what Ukraine will become. ""They're going to have to wake up and smell the coffee... because they've won.""*

**Manufacturing Reality**: In 2024, Russia built 60-80 modern main battle tanks. NATO built zero (South Korea built 56 for Poland). This reflects not just industrial but intellectual collapse.

---

## **X. Key Anecdotes & Personal Encounters**

**Larry Johnson's Moscow Trip**:
- **Lt. Gen. Apti Alaudinov**: Commander of the famous ""gas pipe operation"" (13 km march hunched through a 4-foot diameter pipeline). A Chechen War survivor integrating Muslims and Orthodox Christians. Repeatedly told Johnson: ""I hate war... we need to get this stopped,"" but would defend Russia militarily.
- **Respectful Adversaries**: Russian generals (including Zhuravlyov, Zavizion) spoke respectfully of U.S. military capabilities, even when offering criticism—sharply contrasting with American generals' disrespectful rhetoric.

**James Billington's Cannon**: Macgregor's favorite historical anecdote—the Tsarist cannon that stuffed the Polish Tsar inside and shot him back to Poland. *""I wish we had a history like that. There are a lot of people we should shoot back to somewhere else.""*

---

## **XI. Conclusion: Twilight of Two Nations**

Macgregor frames this as twilight for both Ukraine and American military prestige:

- **Ukraine**: Demographically hollowed, militarily shattered, its future decided entirely by Russia. The West's refusal to negotiate is ""inhumane,"" sacrificing a generation for delusion.
- **United States**: Trapped in a cycle of self-deception, political promotions, simulation-based training that teaches fantasy, and an inability to admit error. The ""Billy Bob"" syndrome and ""herd of cats"" NATO structure make defeat against a peer competitor likely.

The interview ends with Macgregor's core warning: We are refighting WWII while Russia has created a new paradigm of warfare. Until the West confronts its hubris and institutional dysfunction, it will continue losing wars of choice against prepared adversaries.

**Final Verdict**: The war is over. Russia won. The West's refusal to admit this is extending human suffering and accelerating American military decline.",3,1763131860.0,WayOfTheBern,1,0.81,False

1owyg8n,https://i.redd.it/natzk5xrj81g1.jpeg,I tested a soulmate feature in an astrology app… and I’m honestly freaked out because it described my partner perfectly,"Okay, so I’m not the type who takes astrology apps super seriously. I like the memes, the daily horoscopes that are vague enough to apply to everyone, the aesthetic moon phases—whatever.

But then I saw this one feature in an astro app called Soulmate Sketch, and my curiosity beat my skepticism. I hit the button just to see what kind of woo-woo nonsense it would generate.

And I swear to god, the description it gave me was basically my partner in paragraph form.

Here’s the exact text I got:

“Your soulmate is a man with a restless, seeking mind—his thoughts move in quicksilver arcs, always searching for the deeper current beneath the surface of things. He has been healing from a betrayal that taught him to be wary of easy charm and hollow promises; trust is hard-won with him, but once given, he is all-in, fiercely loyal. When he falls in love, he becomes suddenly shy, almost awkward, as if startled by the strength of his own feelings. He will listen to you with an intensity that almost burns—his gaze will linger, as if he’s mapping the constellations of your face, trying to memorize every detail for the long nights ahead.”

Excuse me???
That is exactly my partner.

“Restless mind”? Yup.
“Still healing from past betrayal and slow to trust”? Unfortunately, yes.
“Turns shy when feelings hit too hard”? That’s literally his whole love language.
“And the way he listens like he’s downloading your soul”? I feel personally attacked.

But it gets weirder.

The app also described how we’d meet… and it accidentally recreated our actual first meeting

The reading said we’d meet between late summer and early fall, in a small indie coffee shop on a quiet side street, and that we’d both reach for the same old, worn-out book by the window.

I laughed out loud at first — until my brain suddenly went “WAIT.”

Because that is literally how we met.

Small hidden coffee shop.
Quiet corner.
Both grabbed the same book from the communal shelf.
Hands touched.
Cliché indie film moment.
I thought it was cute at the time… and now I’m wondering if this app has been spying on me.

Then it listed “three signs” before meeting your soulmate — and I definitely had one of them

The app said the signs would be:

A vivid dream of running through rain but staying dry.

Seeing 11:11 everywhere.

Randomly craving lemon.

I didn’t have all three.
But the 11:11 thing? Oh my god. I saw it constantly around that period. Clocks, receipts, screens, everywhere. It got annoying.

And the final advice the app gave me also matched what I was doing at the time

It told me to be vulnerable, to “show my real self,” to share my writing or creative work, and that my openness would be the thing that draws my soulmate in.

And yeah… that was exactly when I finally pushed myself to publicly share a creative project I’d been hiding for years.
And a few weeks later, boom — we met.

So now I’m confused

I’m not saying astrology apps are magical.
I’m not saying an algorithm summoned my boyfriend out of thin air.

But the accuracy?
The details?
The timing?

It’s… a lot.

Anyway, if you ever feel like astrology apps are pure entertainment, maybe try some of their weird features just for fun. Sometimes they point out something you didn’t even realize was already unfolding in your life.

1owyevi,https://i.redd.it/di4jnmkgh81g1.jpeg,My self-made song bonus tracker with improved functionality,"Since Tea's spreadsheet is broken and not being updated anymore for quite a while, I updated my tracker program (you might remember I posted about it here earlier) to focus on song bonuses. It runs on a weekly periods, from 12AM monday to 2AM next monday so it handles 8-days game weeks correctly. You can pick your R99 groups (or any groups you're interested in, it's just a filter) and it'll show only selections, or there's option to show all ongoing bonuses too. It correctly tracks overlapped bonuses such as 5% or 9% etc all kinds. It tells you how much longer a bonus will last depending what portion of game week it covers, and it also lists upcoming bonuses for the week's following days. I've added a day code system so it's functional.

Unfortunately it only runs on windows pc with standalone .exe file that's just about 3 megabytes and with a data document basically like a text based simplified excel file.

**The songs are not current as of now, it's where Tea left off which is 2025-03-26 since I've copied song data from their spreadsheet and added my own code based functionality. I'll hand-update newly added songs from 2025 Q2 onwards when I have time, probably in a week or two.**

If you wanna view a different game week's bonus situation, just change your pc's current date/time settings 😁 I have felt lazy and contended with the program directly picking system time, it's much simpler this way. So changing it to a future or past time would do the trick.

Would anyone be interested in using this? Is it appropriate to share zipped exe file here when it's all ready? Asking upfront just in case. Moderators please answer.

For future reference, if it's accepted here I'll update newly added songs each week and update data sheet weekly and update the link here. Since it's a local program it's purely offline and needs to be locally updated via its data regularly to be redownloaded which is just a few KBs anyway.",2,1763131614.0,superstarsmtown,2,1.0,False

I brush intermittently, sporadically. Until last year I used to brush twice a day, floss once a day, wear my retainers every night religiously. 

Since my retainers broke a few months ago I feel my teeth shifting back and I know I will need orthodontic treatment again to get my teeth realigned (I couldn't afford to get them replaced at the time). I smoke and drink black coffee(significant yellowing and staining). My teeth are sensitive when I eat cold or sweet stuff. I am ashamed of it but I go weeks if not months without brushing my teeth.

I underwent a couple of minor surgeries in the past couple months but I'm finally back on my feet and off antibiotics (which to my understanding also affects oral health).

How do I start taking care of my teeth? I can start small today. And in the coming few weeks I can take a loan to invest in my oral health. Please guide me.
Any advice will be highly appreciated.

1owy6ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1owy6ld/econ_tax_reorganization/,[ECON] Tax Reorganization,"#Background 

The World Bank, in its recently published report ""The Economic Development of Guatemala,"" outlined one of the many notable deficiencies in the Guatemalan economy. Taxation. The World Bank's main observations were that the taxation system could be greatly improved, that some tax rates were unnecessarily low, and that several fields of possible taxation have simply been left untouched. In order to remedy these circumstances and gather more funds for future development, Guatemala City sets out to remedy these circumstances. 

#Reforms to Tax Administration 

• Tax Auditors: Árbenz's government has reached into the pool of middle class intellectuals to expand the tax administration. The administration has moved to begin a hiring process with the intent of hiring up to 500 tax auditors and accountants to oversee the tax administration. This large hiring of auditors will remedy the sloggish rate of auditing which is estimated to be two years behind schedule. 

• Tax Auditing: Per the recommendations of the World Bank report, tax auditors will now be instructed to verify auditing figures by making approximate checks on volume of business, inventories, mark ups, and similar information. 

• Retail Sales: Regarding retail sales, tax auditors are encouraged and instructed to organize bookkeeping practices. To this end a small department of 20 bookkeepers will be created with the sole aim of organizing accounting books for the tax administration. More aggressive auditing will occur immediately. The World Bank estimates that a 10% increase in receipts from retail sales would generate at least 500,000 quetzals (the Guatemalan currency). 

• Liquor Taxation: Estimated out of a total of 12 million liters in liquor produced in Guatemala, only 8 million liters of that liquor produced pays the preexisting excise tax. Accordingly, the expanded tax auditor base is instructed to strictly enforce excise tax on all ports in Guatemala. More enforced excise taxation would garner at least one million Quetzals in the World Bank estimates, with upwards to 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 Quetzals being gathered if the excise tax is fully enforced. Penalties will be increased should liquor producers be caught attempting to evade this excise tax. 

• Coffee Export Tax: The current rate of taxation on coffee exports is six cents per pound. This has garnered a further 4,350,000 Quetzals for government revenue between 1949 to 1950. However it is estimated by World Bank representatives and Guatemala's own taxing authority that even further government revenue could be gathered from increased taxation. As such, the tax rate for coffee sales has been raised to 15% of the current coffee prices. This will gather a further 4,000,000 Quetzals in revenue for government use. 

• Property Taxes: Property taxes also find themselves increased by Árbenz's government. The property tax rate is increased to five Quetzals per thousand acre. However properties valued at less the 300 Quetzals are exempted from these property taxes. 

• Luxury Import Tax: *Ad valorem* duties will be instated on luxury goods such as jewelry, watches, silks, fine chinas, perfumes, and luxury type passenger cars. 

• Taxation of Foreign Enterprise: Foreign companies such as Empresa Electrica de Guatemala, **United Fruit Company**, and International Railways of Guatemala will be taxed. Taxation on these companies will occur on their locally earned income. The taxation rate will be raised to 15% of their locally earned income. 

#Summary 

These tax reforms will raise 7.2 million Quetzals over the following year if aggressively pursued. Which will be the case due to the expansion of the auditing base and the hiring of even more auditors. The last of these tax reforms is the most important - as it represents an increased enforcement of taxation on foreign companies which was previously absent. The revenue gathered will further assist the reforms Arbenz intends to enact for his country during the rest of 1951 to 1955.",1,1763131066.0,ColdWarPowers,0,1.0,False

 Im a trans woman, and I work in a company that is american, but our office is in Poland. Some time ago we got a new coworker who happens to be non-binary. They dont really work in my departament, but my position requires me to cooperate with other departaments, including theirs. 

 Their first day, and their manager basically introduces them to me. At first I thought she's gonna work with my team, but no; apparently, our HR decided since Im the only trans person in our office, I should ease her into the company. The ethics of outing me like this aside (I pass well enough, so most people dont know that I am trans), it's already weird to assume that since they're trans-adjacent, I should be the one mentoring them. 

 And I dont know how to describe them but... Very american. Loud, like obnoxiously loud and quite hyperactive. Maybe its cultural differences, but I felt like dealing with someone wayyy younger (Im 27, they are 20). They kept asking me questions about my transition etc while I was trying to show them around the office, they were quite annoying in general. I showed them around, told her to contact their supervisor if they has other questions, and sent them on their merry way. 



 Ever since, it felt like they were hunting for me. Whenever I'd go for a coffee, they'd be there to chat. Im not anti-social, but not the biggest on small talk. I tried being polite, but it just got so grating over like 2 weeks. They are apparently very openly and loudly queer, which Im not, and while some questions are understandable (like if there are pride parades in our city etc), they sometimes got just down right weird, like asking me if fiancee is cis etc. 

  
 Another thing was language. The office language is English, but me and other poles usually talk in polish at smoke breaks etc. I was very positivly surprised, since they actually tried to learn a bit of the language, but there was a small hurdle; polish is a gendered language, and there really isnt a way to address an nb person in it without it being gendered. I did explain it to them, and they seemingly understood it. A few days later, they come back and declare she found a few ways and they were just... Quite horrid. Either using 3rd person singular neutral (which is used for animals, children, and objects), or the attempts to create a proper form (which is horribly grating to any native speaker). Explaining to them that those forms are rather non-usable in polish got them really upset and defensive. I settled on using pluralis majestatis for them, which still is super weird to use, but makes everyone's ears bleed less. 

  
 A few days ago, they decided that since I never go to after-work socials, they want to go with me to a queer bar. I declined, since I just wanted to spend time with my fiancee after work, but they e kept asking me each day and seemed to get more and more agitated with my refusals. 

  
 Yesterday, I got called by HR to talk because... They filed a complaint that I made them feel unwelcome. HR was very confused by it as well, since I generally never had a single issue within the office. Nothing really came out of it, but I wasted my lunch break to go through it. 

  
 When I saw the, I did take them to the side and told them that I'd really prefer if they only contact me in work matters. They called me an internalised-queerphobe and left. Didnt have any issues with them from that point, but I do have to sometimes endure getting a stink eye from here, and it kind of makes feel like I could have handled it better.

* **80% of your room should be neutral, calm, and foundational** (think: walls, large furniture, flooring, big décor pieces)
* **20% should be bold, expressive accents** (think: art, throw pillows, plants, lighting, pattern, pops of color)

This balance lets your space feel **organized, harmonious, and stylish**, while still having personality.

**🎨 Why the 80/20 Rule Works**

Because if everything is bold, the room feels chaotic…  
And if everything is neutral, it feels flat and boring.

The 80/20 rule gives you:

* Visual balance
* Style without clutter
* Freedom to add personality *without overwhelming the room*

**🛋️ How to Use the 80/20 Rule in Real Decorating**

**✔️ Example 1: Living Room**

* **80%:** Neutral sofa, light walls, simple rug, wooden coffee table
* **20%:** Colorful cushions, bold artwork, plants, patterned throw

**✔️ Example 2: Bedroom**

* **80%:** White bedding, beige headboard, natural nightstands
* **20%:** Statement lamps, textured pillows, a bold bench, wall art

**✔️ Example 3: Small Room**

* Keep the **80% very light** (white, cream, soft gray)
* Use **20%** for pops like navy, green, gold, or terracotta

This instantly makes the space feel bigger, cleaner, and more modern.

**🌟 Designer Tip**

You can also use the rule for:

* Mixing patterns (80% simple, 20% bold)
* Styling shelves (80% functional, 20% decorative)
* Choosing materials (80% soft/neutral, 20% statement textures)

**A little Backstory on why I have this car:**

Around September of '24 I was getting a little tired of the Fuel Economy, and service costs on my '21 STI. I mean come on, it's a 4 cylinder Japanese car why does it get 18MPG (Nor did I wanna pay for the timing belt service I had coming)? So I decided I'd sell it, and buy something I had always wanted, a Mustang GT. Well long story short, I hated that car. Sure V8s are sick, it somehow got better economy than the STI, but it just wasn't fun. You can't wind that out basically anywhere near where I live (DMV area), and the few backroads we do have, it was to wide, and you'd struggle to keep up with literally any small, lightweight car.

So in November of '24, after about 3 months with the Mustang, I heard they were getting rid of the manual for the GTI, and figured I'd see what was a available in my area. I found my '24 GTI 380 S with the 6spd listed just under $28k. Worked with the dealer and broke even on the Mustang, OTD for $27k and some change on the GTI, after paying the taxes, tags and all that up front.

Okay on to the GTI itself... *I know.. I know I ramble*

**Highway, and Commute:**

After purchasing the car, about a week later I drove it to Florida and back for a wedding. Awesome choice, super comfy on the highway, the adaptive cruise took a little to get used to but works just fine. Fuel economy was (and still is) amazing. I've averaged 30mpg since owning the car, and I get 35-38 on long trips depending on the speed, location, etc. Which is rather impressive living outside of DC as I do. The manual in this car is excellent. I know people hate on it for being mushy or a number of other things, but as a daily that you wanna have fun in, this is perfect. I know the DSG is ""faster"" I really don't care. I truly hate automatics, they all have odd behavior and I'm not nearly as attentive as a driver when the car is just a couch that I don't interact with.

**Back Roads:**

This thing is a gem. The roads around me, and up through PA where I go to see family and what not are all super tight, and twisty. Even my STI struggled on those roads. The GTI is super nimble for a car made in '24 whose focus isn't just a raw sports car. The power is almost perfect, though I think a stage 1 tune is in order. There's not much else to say here other than it's a solid 9/10, you only get better than this in something lighter, and AWD, which probably hasn't existed in 20 years.

**Local Community:**

I've always loved GTIs, watching Clarkson drive them on Top Gear as a kid was my first intro to them. From there I saw the Polo WRC on rally stages, the list goes on but I've always liked these cars.

A buddy of mine at work has a Mk7 TDI, which is awesome. This guy knows basically anything I could think of about VWs which kinda helped me with that initial fear of ""German cars always have problems"" you always hear from people that don't know anything. I started helping him work on the TDI (170k miles or something on it), learning how to change wheel bearings, axles, ball joints, bushing, suspension, you name it.

Naturally we started working on my GTI, currently I just have the Clubsport muffler and rear valence, as well as an IE intake that we just put in. So huge props to him for all the help super nice to have someone that knows how to do things and willing to help, and just hang out.

A few other folks at work have GTIs as well, pretty sweet to see 5-6 of them parked in the garage next to each other simply for the sake of doing so.

**Online Community:**

I wanted to add this here as well because coming from the Subaru world, this is really nice. The community there was excellent, and the same goes for here. People are typically super helpful with wheel specs, diagnosing problems, etc. It's another die-hard community where you can tell people really love these cars just like I felt with the STI. I will take a second to trash on the Mustang community a little bit. I know there's some helpful people there to and this is a sweeping generalization, but in the little time I spent looking things up for that car it was *less than ideal,* and I'll just leave it at that.

**The Picture:**

This is my favorite part of this whole thing. I've made a lot of friends through the VW community, but also a few months ago, I was able to convince my brother to get one as well. After a little bit of searching, and teaching him how to drive stick in my car, we found a black GTI for him. Same year, same spec, opposite color.

Super cool to go out on drives together, work on/talk about cars, and just get out there.

**If you made it this far:**

Thanks for reading. Love this car. Feel free to ask me other questions, this was more of me just rambling about my experiences than an actual review, but you can go watch a SavageGeese video for that. If you're in the DMV area feel free to drop me a message or something here, maybe we can all meet up at a Cars and Coffee sometime.

*oh and PS... the touch buttons on the steering wheel are fine, seriously shut up about it. Are actual buttons better? ya duh... Is this a reason to hate the car? No..*",47,1763130320.0,GolfGTI,9,0.99,False
1owxvbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDailyDose/comments/1owxvbm/unmuted_say_so_chapter_3_we_all_have_a_pulpit/,"Unmuted, Say So: Chapter 3: We All Have a Pulpit","# Chapter 3: We All Have a Pulpit

Not everyone will stand behind a wooden podium, gripping a Bible in one hand and gesturing with the other. Not everyone is called to preach sermons from a stage or lead a crowd in worship. But the calling to speak—to testify, to proclaim, to point to Jesus—is not limited to pastors and church leaders.

# XI. The truth is: we all have a pulpit.

My Pulpit Is the Pen. I can’t physically speak. My voice doesn’t echo through microphones or resound in auditoriums. But that didn’t disqualify me from the call to speak the name of Jesus. In fact, it pushed me deeper into it. I was man enough to pick up a pen. And with trembling hands and a burning heart, I decided I would tell the world what Jesus has done for me.

The pen became my pulpit. My words became a voice.

There’s something sacred about knowing that the Lord can use what the world sees as weakness and turn it into a weapon for the Kingdom. The Bible says:

>“But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.” — *1 Corinthians 1:27 (NIV)*

God doesn’t need our eloquence. He wants our **obedience**.

Whether you have a booming voice or a quiet whisper, a large platform or a small circle of influence, God has given you a pulpit—and He’s asking you to use it.

# XII. Biblical Examples: When God Called the Unlikely

Let’s pause and look at some of the people God chose to speak for Him. They weren’t polished. They weren’t perfect. Many of them didn’t even want the job.

* **Moses: “But I can’t speak…”**

When God called Moses to deliver His people from Egypt, Moses gave excuses. His most notable?

>“Pardon your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent... I am slow of speech and tongue.” — *Exodus 4:10 (NIV)*

But God wasn’t moved by Moses’ limitations. He said:

>“Who gave human beings their mouths? … Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.” — *Exodus 4:11–12*

Moses thought his weakness disqualified him. God saw it as a reason to display His strength.

* **Jeremiah: “I’m too young.”**

Jeremiah was called to be a prophet while still a youth. Understandably, he hesitated:

>“Alas, Sovereign Lord... I do not know how to speak; I am too young.” — *Jeremiah 1:6 (NIV)*

But God replied:

>“Do not say, ‘I am too young.’ You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you.” — *Jeremiah 1:7*

God doesn’t wait for us to be ready by our standards. He equips us by His Spirit.

* **Paul: The Pen in a Prison**

Paul wrote most of the New Testament from a prison cell. He couldn’t travel. He couldn’t preach in synagogues. But he still had a pulpit—a pen, parchment, and the power of the Holy Spirit.

His letters are still preaching today.

**What Does Your Pulpit Look Like?**

Let’s redefine what a pulpit really is. It’s not just the structure in the front of a church. It’s **any place where truth is proclaimed and Christ is lifted up**. And in today’s world, there are more pulpits than ever before.

Here are a few:

* **The Digital Pulpit**

Social media, blogs, videos, podcasts—these are modern-day pulpits. People scroll through their feeds searching for meaning, hope, identity. You can meet them there with the truth of God’s Word.

* A Scripture post might hit someone in the middle of despair.
* A blog testimony might bring clarity to someone wrestling with God.
* A video message might lead someone to Christ on their worst day.

You don’t need a million followers. You just need to be faithful with the ones you have.

* **The Relational Pulpit**

Your circle of influence—family, friends, coworkers, neighbors—is a pulpit. You preach through how you live, how you love, how you serve, and when you speak truth at the right time.

Sometimes the most powerful sermon is a consistent life.

* **The Local Pulpit**

This includes small groups, Bible studies, children’s ministry, youth mentoring, and more. You don’t have to be the main teacher. You can disciple someone over coffee. You can lead a prayer meeting in your living room.

Every local expression of the Church needs people willing to use their voice for God's glory.

* **The Hidden Pulpit**

Some pulpits are unseen. A journal you write in obedience. A prayer you intercede when no one else is watching. A note of encouragement you leave on someone’s desk.

God sees what others don’t. And He uses every act of faithfulness.

# XIII. How to Use Your Pulpit Well

Whatever your pulpit looks like, here are practical ways to steward it well:

* **Surrender It to God**

Ask the Lord to purify your motives. Are you using your voice to glorify Him—or to gain approval? God honors what is surrendered.

>“Whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.” — *1 Corinthians 10:31*

* **Speak the Truth in Love**

Boldness without love is noise. Love without truth is hollow. Use your voice to build, not tear down. Correct with grace. Encourage with Scripture.

>“Speak the truth in love...” — *Ephesians 4:15*

* **Be Consistent**

You don’t have to post every day or lead every week, but be faithful. Let your life reflect the message you preach. Integrity gives your voice weight.

>“Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.” — *Matthew 5:16*

* **Don’t Wait for a Stage**

Don’t wait for perfect conditions. Start where you are. Use what you have. Speak what you know. God isn’t looking for polished performers—He’s looking for surrendered vessels.

**A Word of Encouragement**

Maybe you feel like you have nothing to say. Maybe your voice has been silenced by pain, fear, or shame. But if Jesus has saved you, **you have something to say**. And someone needs to hear it.

You have a pulpit.

Use it.

It may be a blog. A classroom. A kitchen table. A prayer room. A keyboard. A text message. A sermon. A smile. A song.

**But it’s yours.**

And if you’ll offer it to Jesus, He’ll use it in ways you never imagined.

>“Let the redeemed of the Lord tell their story—those he redeemed from the hand of the foe…” — *Psalm 107:2 (NIV)*

So, pick up your pen. Raise your voice. Shine your light.

**The world needs your testimony.**

1owxv0k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1owxv0k,"Daggerheart sub just stickied an advertisement for an ""anti-AI marketplace"" without realizing it. The guy who runs that marketplace got his start spamming reddit threads with AI summaries.","I like the game Daggerheart, it's a tabletop RPG made by the Critical Role folks. It's fun, a good narrative-first fantasy game to replace D&D which I have grown tired of even without considering how shit Wizards of the Coast are as publishers. But my one gripe with Daggerheart is how strongly anti-AI the community around it is. I do get it, it's all writers, theater nerds, and voice actors. People who feel directly threatened by AI advancements. So I don't say anything, I don't use AI in their circles, I respect the rule though I don't agree with it.

Then I woke up today, made my coffee, sat down to check reddit, and saw this shit. This big post made about the ""AI TTRPG Takeover!"" which I planned to read to get a little chuckle out of and then ignore, which is how I usually engage with anti-AI garbage. But this time I saw something fishy.

About mid-way through this post starts talking about Heart of Daggers. HoD is a marketplace for Daggerheart third-party stuff. People who want to make and sell things for Daggerheart like new classes, monsters, adventures, whatever. Nothing wrong with that conceptually. Nothing really suspicious about mentioning it either, aside from the fact that *literally nobody talks about HoD*. Daggerheart doesn't have a big thriving creator community yet. ""Daggerbrew"" the homebrew sub for Daggerheart is really small and inactive. HoD is even smaller than that. So the only person you ever see talking about HoD is the reddit account run by the guy who runs the marketplace. That's not hyperbole, or my own personal anecdote that ""I never see anyone else talking about it"" I mean literally go use the search function in this sub and it's just that guy who has ever mentioned it before.  
  
Then I noticed the account posting this anti-AI diatribe is using a generic reddit username. So I check the account. It's 10mo old and has only ever posted in Daggerheart communities.

Then I check the HoD account... 10mo old and only ever posted in Daggerheart communities...

So I'm pretty positive the Anti-AI diatribe is actually from a sock puppet for the main HoD account to advertise their marketplace. And realizing this, again, I wouldn't really care generally. I'd probably be on board with someone fleecing the moderators of a little subreddit to get their cheese, you do you boo, we're all on that grindset.   
  
But in this case, this is a community that I actually care about, and where I've deliberately not interjected my opinions on AI, and where I've deliberately avoided AI tools to participate, and all the while this guy got his start spamming threads with AI summaries and copied & pasted replies begging creators to bring their content to his marketplace while damning AI in the same breath. It's not respectful. It's deliberate deception. It's selfish capitalizing on their concerns for their jobs and their future. Whether those concerns are misplaced or valid is a different topic, the fact is they're real feelings for those creators.

I use Gemini all the time, and I used Co-Pilot before that. I'm 100% positive that just three months ago this account was clicking on any Daggerheart homebrew, putting it into an LLM, asking for a summary, and then pasting their beggars plea at the end of it. And now they're riding the wave of anti-AI fearmongering to get their hypocritical marketplace at the top of the biggest sub for this community, all while having happily deployed it maliciously to get their start. They don't care about creators or the community. It's just the money.

I tried to point this out there. Immediately downvoted. Oh well. I guess it's a cautionary tale. Hate and fear is exploitable. Hope someone learns something from this.",4,1763130299.0,DefendingAIArt,1,0.83,False

My kids are 3 years and 1 year old, my youngest has wanted to sit/roll on me 24/7 the past few days and my oldest won’t listen to anything I say. I just want 1 easy day, 1 day to be lazy, just 1 single day that someone else has to stress about everything instead of me. I have to keep track of all laundry (where it is, if it’s washed/dried, etc.), what the kids will and won’t eat in the house, doctors appointments, cats medications, just everything. 

My husband isn’t useless or a bad husband/dad but he’s in the military and works terrible hours so is barely ever home. We have no village, I have no time to go to the doctor myself if need be, or time to myself ever I’m just home with the kids all the time. We can’t hire babysitters or anything because we live paycheck to paycheck and now are budgeting even more for at least a small Christmas for the kids. None of this makes any sense I’m sure but I just needed to vent, I’m so tired of not being listened to, having to keep track of everyone’s things (I love my husband but he doesn’t even look before asking me where things are anymore and now our oldest is doing it too), being touched 24/7 by everyone, never getting a break, I just want to scream. 

Our house is a mess, all chores need to be done, I’ve barely gotten sleep the past 2 days so I’m exhausted and irritable, I have to go get groceries by myself soon, and all I wanted was a coffee this morning that my kids accidentally spilled it after 1 sip. I love and adore my kids and hate complaining but they’ve been so clingy and acting (in all honesty) terrible lately I just need a break from everyone.

1owxsmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/thyroidcancer/comments/1owxsmf/recent_ptc_diagnosis_and_right_side/,Recent PTC diagnosis and Right side Hemi-thyroidectomy,"So a lot has happened the past few weeks. Being diagnosed with Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma was certainly the last thing running through my head for this year, but here we are.

35 male here. I had Cancer (Rhabdomyosarcoma) in the right side of my jaw when I was 4 and a half, diagnosed day before Christmas and stage 4 inoperable. By the time it was found, it had spread to the mandible. No Surgeons would operate on it, until 1 surgeon returned from England, and said he would do it. I had 30 rounds of radiation on the right hand side of my face, 7 different types of chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant, jaw reconstruction etc. but in remission since I was 11 I think? That’s the summarized back story.

For a few weeks, I had noticed a small lump on the left hand side of my neck, and mentioned it to my GP whilst having a Tele health appointment. She said if it is still like that in a few weeks, come in and let me see it in person. I wasn’t that stressed about it, as I had just had a flu/virus a few weeks before. Part of me knew it was in the location of Lymphanodes, but part of me also knew something was off. I booked in to see my GP, and mentioned it to dad. Something clicked in his head, and he rummaged around to find a summary piece of paper with all the procedures and surgeries I had gone through, and what needed to be monitored. Things I had not honestly monitored over the years, as I had other health matters. One of the things listed, was the Thyroid. A lot of 

I saw my GP, took a photocopy of the list, and she wrote me up a referral to get an ultrasound done on the left hand side of my neck where the little lump was. I then asked her to add thyroid onto it, and she begrudgingly hand wrote Thyroid in blue ink on the referral. I then managed to get an utrasound that same day (8/10/25), including the Thyroid, which I don’t think had been done for about 10 years. I spoke to the doctor over the phone on the 9/10/25 re the results, and she said there was a small
Nodule on the right hand side that was 14mmx13mm that was recommend to be biopsied. Called around and managed to get a biopsy booked in for 10/10/25. Everything moved very quick.

I had the needle biopsy done, no dramas and was told it would be about 3-5 business days for the results. After the biopsy was done, the stress and anxiety kicked in. On Wednesday 15/10/25 I called up the company doing the pathology, and they confirmed the results had been sent to my GP. I then had my Tele Health later that day, and my GP said the results still had not come in. We discussed what the company doing the biopsy had told me, and she said let me look into it. An hour or so later, she called me and said there had been system errors, and she had finally got the results. I went into the acoustic phone booth at work, and she told me the nodule on my right hand side had come back positive for Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma. I asked what that meant. And she said it was Thyroid Cancer, but then said that stupidly infuriating line of “If you were to pick a cancer out of a bag, this is the one you want”.  I went very numb. I then called mum and dad to tell them, and drove home. It was the right hand side. The same side of my head where I had numerous radiation treatments nearly 3 decades ago. 

Coincidentally, the next day 16/10/25, I had an appointment set up a few months in advance to see a dental professor at Chris O’Brien Lifehouse Sydney, to start the ball rolling on future Jaw reconstruction. Lots of really bad head pain the past few years, and was looking forward to having a normal functioning jaw. 
He asked me how I was going, and I told him the night before I had been told about the PTC. He immediately discussed getting me into see one of his colleagues, a surgeon who specializes in Head and Neck. I then saw that surgeon, booked me in for the 5th of November to remove the night hand side of my Thyroid, and that was over a week ago now. 2 nights in hospital, throwing up and head pain. I went back to work 13/11/25, and I was exhausted. 

I have an appointment to see my surgeon and discuss the results this Wednesday 19th November, and my honest concern is that I have not had any scans to see if it has spread anywhere else. Looking back, I had a slightly hoarse voice for a few months, and I was very tired for absolutely no reason. Coffee would do nothing. 

I’m doing OK after the procedure, I guess. Scar healing well, minimal swelling, slight bruising, tightness in neck, no real pain in throat, and eating like normal. The concern I have is that it’s spread. Probably anxiety and over thinking. Even though I keep getting told that it’s a very treatable Cancer, and the right hand side is out, I am still nervous about Wednesday. 

When i found out, I was numb for over a week, and cried myself to sleep each night. Pulling over the car on my way home from work to cry. Running on Auto Pilot. I think I am still coming to terms with the whole thing, as it still doesn’t seem real having Cancer, let alone having Cancer for a second time in my life. 

I have been reading everyone’s tales of war, and they mean something to someone. They mean something to me. Keep fighting 💪🏻",4,1763130145.0,thyroidcancer,1,1.0,False

So I decided to take initiative and like why not see him and stuff and I was kind of developing a crush but I don't show it and I wasn't planning on confessing. I've also never went out with a guy alone. And no guy ever liked me. And I am clinically diagnosed with asymmetry. So I never expect anyone to like me.

Now I realised what the heck he likes me and I'm meeting him basically I'm making things idk more accessible? And while I don't mind him liking me as I said before I like him too I'm just still in med school and I kind of don't believe that anyone is capable of liking me from my own insecurities so I can't start a relationship at all.

He wants us to meet more often when I told him I'm not gonna spend a lot of time he told me you're already deciding when to leave? Then told me it's ok I already planned on leaving early since it's our first meet up and it won't be our last with a :).

I bought a new coffee grinder SENCOR SCG 6050SS, basic Illy coffee, and a moka pot that makes two cups. Sadly, the moka pot is really small, so I need to use a smaller pot (My smallest pan is bigger than the moka pot)

The first coffee I made (a moka americano) was one of the best I've had, but the next eight coffees I tried making today were worse and worse.

They taste bitter, and it takes a long time for the first coffee to come out. I tried preheating the pot more, but the coffee tasted worse each time.

I tried to preheat the pot as much as possible (using the smallest burner on my stove), but now the coffee tastes flat. It took closer to a minute for the first coffee to come out. 

I always preheat the water in an electric kettle to between 80 and 90 °C. Also, when the coffee starts to come out, I take the moka pot off the stove.

At this point, I'm sick of coffee. How many things am I doing wrong?
