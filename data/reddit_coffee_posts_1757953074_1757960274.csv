1nhti6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/1nhti6q/has_anyone_successfully_treated_their_chronic_and/,Has anyone successfully treated their chronic and recurrent UTIs??? I’m at my wits end.,"I’ve suffered from constant UTIs since I was 10 years old. I’ve had a few that have showed up on urinalysis but the majority don’t. The standard symptoms appear without fail; burning sensation, urgency, general pain. I’ve been on amoxicillin so many times I’ve developed a resistance to it. The only medication that brings me relief is Fosfomycin but at this point I’m scared I’ll develop a resistance to that as well. My last course was 7 days of Levofloxacin but my burning sensation hasn’t gone away. 

I take d-mannose pretty much daily, I’ve cut down on coffee so much I drink one every few days, I drink around 3L of water a day, I don’t use anything but water on my private parts when washing, I wear cotton underwear only, I don’t smoke or take drugs, I pee after every sexual encounter (no more encounters as of late after a breakup so I know it’s not sex related) but I still get a UTI ONCE A MONTH. IM DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT.

I’ve been tested for both mycoplasma, ureaplasma, and a full std panel too. I’m in the clear for all. I get my urine sent to the lab each time but 99% of the time nothing comes up. WHAT DO I DO. My GP has pretty much exhausted all options. My urologist says my kidneys are perfectly healthy. I’ve no kidney stones.

Please, can someone give me any advice? Idc how ridiculous it is. If it’s helped get rid of cUTIs I’ll try ANYTHING. If it’s medication I’ll happily chat to my gp this week. Anything at all. I’m at a loss. Please help. ",2,1757960053.0,Healthyhooha,0,1.0,False

1nhthov,https://www.reddit.com/r/dysthymia/comments/1nhthov/i_just_dont_care/,I just don't care,"Been thinking a lot lately. I'm stuck and don't care to get out of this hopeless existence. I've thinking about my therapist and how I must be disappointing her with my lack of progress, but I'm too much of a people-pleaser to being up that I'm contemplating quitting. Plus I have a lot of repressed anger and I'd be afraid I'd blow up and blame my lack of progress on her. I don't even need therapy and I don't wanna change. Well, I'll change on my own terms. I wanna run away but I always end up stuck doing the same thing over and over again.

I don't know why I'm thinking so much about her. Probably because she's the only person I talk to on an emotionally intimate basis (as emotionally intimate as you can get with a slab of concrete like me), and the last time I actually talked to her about my depression and how I was feeling, I feel like she completely blew me off.

Meds don't work, they just make me numb. Which is better than the anxiety/OCD I was dealing with before, I guess. I should probably get off this medication and try another one, but I have the fear that autistic burnout is causing my depressed mood, and meds will never work.

Coffee and alcohol are the only two things that bring me any joy - that's it. Even music is unsatisfying to me now.

There's no way I'm suited for any type of love or connection, with how disconnected I am from the world around me. Yeah, I put on a happy face, but ultimately, my mind is elsewhere most days.

Anyway, that's my vent. I know I'm all over the place, but like I said, I've been thinking a lot.",1,1757960021.0,dysthymia,0,1.0,False

At first, our conversations were obviously just about sex, but after we met for the first time, things seemed to escalate more and more each day. She started a list of movies she wanted to watch with me, showed me pictures of herself as a child (and asked for mine), asked about my zodiac sign and even had a friend read my birth chart (then asked me to do hers so we could compare). She was about to move and kept me updated minute by minute, even consulting me about furniture and stuff. She also proposed something for my band (she’s a designer) and wanted to come to a gig the following week. She started saying good morning and wouldn’t let me go at night (in a cute way), so we ended up talking for hours.

Last Sunday she invited me to her place to watch one of the movies, have some snacks, and obviously have sex. I was the first person she had ever invited. We watched the movie cuddling, drank coffee, then had sex, and while we were holding each other naked, she casually said: “Oh, you know haha, I just split up with my ex about a month ago, and obviously I don’t want anything serious. Not now, not ever.”

I didn’t know how to feel. I felt vulnerable — she had just gone down on me and I was in a completely different mood. What shocked me the most was how surprised she looked at my reaction. Then I just stood up, got dressed, and we went downstairs to talk. The talk didn’t last more than five minutes because she said “the topic became nasty and nonsense”, and I was like, “girl, I’m just trying to know what to say lol.” She then led me to the front door, I asked again for at least a quick talk, she denied it with the coldest look I’ve ever seen, and I just left without even a kiss on the cheek.

The rest of the week she wanted to maintain the same kind of relationship. I tried to go along with it because she was pretty attractive and the sex was good too. But obviously it wasn’t the same, and after some arguments I just unfollowed her on Instagram and deleted her number.

I’m writing this here because it’s not something I want to share too much with my friends — they’ve already listened to me — but I still feel pretty bad right now. I thought I had met a nice girl, we really matched on a lot of things, and what also bothers me is that if she had told me the truth from the start, I might have accepted the situation without getting myself too involved.",0,1757959822.0,offmychest,0,0.5,False

Philly is a great city for vinyl with shops and bars spinning records all across the city. Our route passing 14 record shops and vinyl-spinning bars (marked on [the route](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/52318348)) was developed by WNR organizer Peter K, and the ride will be led by WNR organizer Jo N.  
  
Here’s the list of the record shops and bars that spin vinyl that we’ll pass on our route:

1. Beautiful World Syndicate
2. Latchkey
3. Fountain Porter
4. Molly’s Books and Records
5. Repo Records
6. Philly AIDS Thrift 
7. Digital Underground
8. Cratediggaz Records
9. The International Bar
10. Philadelphia Record Exchange
11. Milk Crate Cafe
12. Creep Records
13. Glory Beer Bar
14. 48 Record Bar

Buying records is a great way to support musicians who’ve been struggling to make a living on the fractions of a penny paid out per stream. It also encourages the ritual of listening to entire albums instead of being at the mercy of algorithm-driven playlists.  
  
The ride ends near 2nd and Chestnut, where you’ll have your choice of three bars to end your evening: 48 Record Bar, Sassafras, and Brownies Irish Pub. 48 Record Bar is a small space with a capacity of 35 people so feel free to overflow to Sassafras or Brownies instead. Also consider bar-hopping to give folks a chance to check out 48 Record Bar!

I think it was sometime in 2021 or 2022. It was raining, and I had gone to Mumbai University, Kalina campus, for some work related to my degree. Since the campus is so large, I was a bit confused about which direction the Kalina gate was. That’s when I met this girl — I think she was a teacher at Don Bosco.

I asked her for directions, and she said, “You can come with me, I’m going that way.” So we started walking and talking.

At one point, we passed a canteen or a tea/coffee shop. Just on the left, straight ahead, was the Kalina gate. On the opposite side, I think it was the Vidyavihar gate.

She pointed out her route, then pointed towards the Kalina gate and said, “They have coffee there.” I just nodded and said, “Okay.”

Then she repeated it again — “They have coffee there.” I responded politely again, not thinking much of it.

The third and final time, she just pointed towards the Kalina direction without saying anything.
Only now I realize… she was probably inviting me to have a cup of coffee with her.

I wanted to share something we’ve been building here in Denver! My husband Ty and I started **Flipside Coffee**, a mobile espresso bar + coffee cart catering company. We bring full espresso service (think lattes, cappuccinos, chai, cold brew, custom syrups, etc.) to all kinds of events — from weddings in the mountains to corporate activations and even conferences at the Convention Center.

What makes us a little different:

* We use **organic ingredients** and make our own syrups in-house (our maple spice latte is a favorite 🍁).
* We travel everywhere — we’ve driven up to Aspen, Vail, and even out to Manhattan for an event once.
* We love **customization**: branded cups, custom cart panels, even latte art printing.

It started as just the two of us with a cart and a stegosaurus mascot (because coffee should be fun!) and has grown into something we get to share with big brands, local schools, and private parties alike.

I know Reddit isn’t for hard selling, so this is more of a “hi, we’re here!” post — but if you’re planning something or just curious, I’d love to connect or answer questions about what goes into running a coffee cart business. Always down to share behind-the-scenes!

I am a 30M with (relatively) healthy lifestyle and otherwise healthy, have been feeling mildly exhausted for about 5 years. Main complaint is having sleep issues (having trouble getting quality sleep even at 8 hours of sleep with around 30-40 minutes of deep sleep) Always wake up tired, and can’t fall back asleep when i wake up, sometimes around 6am sometimes around 3am. Almost always feeling sleepy around 12pm-4pm, even if i have a cup of coffee around 10:30am. But also some scalp hands. shins and scalp dryness and maybe hair shedding? Mild face puffiness in the morning too (maybe just because i’m sleepy and tired)
I am aware of all things sleep hygiene, caffeine intake, blood sugar spikes etc. I workout 3-4 times a week, I run and bike, and I was able to gain healthy weight in the last 3-4 years, from 150lbs to 195lbs. 
But I have been feeling increasingly disinterested in my hobbies and everything around me, feeling tired and not excited about anything. I convinced myself that it could be background depression or related to stress or my Testosterone levels. Ended up seeing a doctor who reluctantly agreed to do the blood test, where we found that my TSH is 5.65 (range 0.22-4.22) and free T4 at 18 (12-22). Without any further tests or ultrasound to check my thyroid i got prescribed 25mg Synthroid which I started taking today after a week long research into this.  Now I am concerned whether I should’ve waited another month and do one more test to see if my TSH level is the same (first test was done in July, early morning on an empty stomach) after having a fairly stressful 2 month in May-June due to money and employment and just general lack direction in life. I struggle to pick up side hustles to carry me through financial struggles because I am just tired even thinking about it, for example working a bar shift occasionally until 2-3am feels like a crazy decision considering how tired I am on a regular basis, in bed at 10:30PM. 
Should I try Synthroid for prescribed 3 months and then do another blood test and see how I feel? or maybe do another test without Synthroid and get ultrasound done to know the state of my thyroid? my dad’s thyroid has been reducing in size and according to his endocrinologist  i can expect having some problems too.

1nht7w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1nht7w9/explore_why_the_best_coffee_machine_lavazza/,Explore Why the Best Coffee Machine Lavazza Classy Plus Stands Out,"Lavazza Classy Plus has become a familiar part of my mornings. With its capability to prepare espresso, lungo, and larger 8 oz coffees, as well as milk-based drinks like lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos, it's clearly designed for coffee enthusiasts who love variety. I was immediately drawn to the polished design, which is compact enough to fit snugly on my kitchen countertop without taking up much space. With added functionality like an adjustable coffee and milk preparation setup, I felt like this all-in-one brewer promised a blend of convenience and elegance right from the start.

**Design and Build**  
Nothing makes a kitchen appliance more appealing than when it seamlessly merges form and function. The Lavazza Classy Plus espresso machine strikes the perfect balance. Its modern and sleek aesthetic paired with an easy-to-navigate interface creates a pleasant user experience. For a single-serve machine, its size (7.87 x 18.9 x 13.78 inches) feels just right, even for smaller kitchens. The built-in milk frother—a crucial feature for fans of creamy lattes and frothy cappuccinos—adds a touch of luxury that you don’t often find in similarly sized machines. Also, it feels durable and sturdily built, but it’s light enough at 9.92 pounds to move around without breaking a sweat.

**Ease of Use and Versatility**  
What stood out most in my daily use was how intuitive the functionality is here. This brewer is compatible with both Lavazza Blue and Expert capsules, offering flexibility in coffee flavor and intensity. The selection process for beverages is straightforward. You can easily choose between single espresso shots or double-shot options. I particularly appreciated the adjustable height feature, which allowed me to brew directly into various cup sizes, from espresso cups to taller coffee mugs. It’s perfect for someone indecisive like me, who craves a creamy macchiato one day and a simple lungo the next.

**Highlights**  
- Compact yet elegant design ideal for small kitchens  
- Built-in milk frother for cappuccinos and lattes  
- Compatible with Lavazza Blue and Expert capsules  
- Adjustable heights for multiple cup and preparation options  

[Check Lavazza Classy Plus price on Amazon.](https://windtoons.com/p/b08j8j3s4y/)

**Performance in Action**  
Anyone who’s made the switch from drip coffee to an espresso machine will understand the thrill of a well-crafted cup. The brewing speed here is impressive, clocking in at less than a minute for most beverages. The frothing component delivers velvety milk every time, whether I’m in the mood for a simple cappuccino or experimenting with latte art (though my skills need serious work). Double-shot functionality, in particular, impressed me, ensuring a caffeine boost for those long workdays.

On the downside, while the machine delivers excellent coffee consistently, the capsules can feel a bit limited in terms of third-party compatibility. If you’re coming from a different single-serve system, this might mean a shift in your capsule purchasing.

**Negative Attributes**  
- Capsule reliance limits brand flexibility  
- Milk frother can feel a little cumbersome to clean  

**Direct Competitors**  
Comparing the Lavazza Classy Plus to other popular brands like Nespresso or Keurig was inevitable for me. Nespresso machines, particularly those with milk frothers, are equally stylish and compact but often costlier for capsules. On the other hand, Keurig dominates with broader pod compatibility and more drink options (teas, hot cocoa). However, when it comes to quality espresso and a true café-style cappuccino or latte experience, Lavazza definitely holds its ground. What sets it apart is the genuine Italian flavor right in your kitchen, thanks to its exclusive capsule compatibility.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering its versatile features—from double-shot espresso to adjustable cup heights—it’s fair to say that you're paying for more than just a coffee machine. This brewer captures the quality of a café espresso with minimal effort and convenience. Unlike lower-budget machines, the integration of the milk frother means you won’t be scrambling to buy a separate device.

We've been hanging out at work for about a year, and slowly getting closer. I'm still unsure if the biggest thread bonding us is our mutual hatred for our toxic place of work, but I guess I'll know that in a week.

He's extremely nice, he's kind, he's smart, and he's very beautiful. I'm into him but we're close enough for me to know his type physically- and its definitely not fat girls, which I am one of.

Alright, sure, I'll move on. But lately we've been talking on call at night for like four hours straight, every other day. For weeks. It's so baffling to me to interpret that. I know what I'm getting out of it, because I have a thing for him, but what could HE possibly be getting out of it? Do I take it as a sign that there could be something from his side, or am I doing a wish fulfilment thing and it's just emotional support for a man who barely has other friends? I love my friends deeply and talk to them very often, but the length of our calls + also the fact that we hang out every day at work between coffee breaks is spinning my mind a bit.

1nht6va,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nht6va/aita_for_returning_my_wedding_ring_and_taking_the/,AITA for returning my wedding ring and taking the cash for myself?,"This took place many years ago, before I (34F) knew about this platform. A few days before my 22 birthday I got married to my husband (who was 8 years older than me). Our wedding was nothing fancy and cost around $500 for everything (the church, my dress, the cakes, photographer) and we invited maybe 50 people. We were not rich and I was working towards getting my teaching degree.

For some context - My wedding ring was my grandmother's wedding ring. She had stated the first granddaughter to get married got the ring. Technically, I was the second but my cousin had eloped and didn't want the ring. I absolutely loved her wedding ring and I was excited to have it be apart of me forever as we had unexpectedly lost my grandmother when I was 12. My husband was terrible with money and at times I would have to hide money just to be able to ensure we could pay bills and buy groceries. For that reason (and many more) I refused to get a joint checking account. He had his own and I had my own. He also demanded we buy a nice wedding band for him, which I was okay with. I went and bought him the exact ring he had picked out. A $450+ Black Tungsten wedding band from Kays. (Here is a link to one similar: https://www.kay.com/black-sapphire-wedding-band-black-tungsten-carbide-8mm/p/V-960823704) 

Back to the story - On our wedding night my husband had gotten upset that, while he slept, I had gotten on Facebook to look at the photos people had posted of our wedding. Things escalated and he became violent. Unfortunately, I did not leave then. That's an entirely different story. For the next 5 months (from the wedding day to the day I left for good) I left 3 times because of violence. At one point I had taken my wedding ring off and left it at my parents vacation home. No one else was supposed to be there for several months and I was only of the only other people besides my parents who had a keys to their vacation home. Well my husband gave his usual sweet talk ""I'm so sorry"" and ""it'll never happen again"" and I went back. {Insert face palm smash here and/or eye roll}. I went back to my parents vacation home for my wedding ring but it was missing. My parents said they didn't know where it was but were (understandably) upset that it was missing. I felt bad and was confused because no one else knew it was there besides my parents nor was anyone else supposed to be there. 

    I had to go home and face my husband to tell him my ring was missing. He was upset and said if I hadn't ""overreacted"", wanting to leave him and then taking the ring off it wouldn't have gone missing. I felt so guilty because I was the one who left and the one who took it off only for it to have gone missing. (Yes, I did find out what happened to the ring and to this day I am still hurt but that's also another story). He said he couldn't afford another one, remember he never bought a ring in the first place, and that it was my fault it was missing. I accepted the guilt and moved on. A few weeks later after coming home from work I was met with a surprise. My husband had bought be a beautiful ring. I instantly cried and told him I loved it. He smiled and proposed again. I laughted and said ""Yes, obviously"". He put the ring on and handed me the box, receipt and my debit card. You read that right my husband took my debit card and went to buy me a ring. The best part? It was from Walmart. Now I am not above wearing jewelry from Walmart as I absolutely love their $5 - $10 earrings! I am, however, allergic to nickel and have to be very careful about the jewelry I wear. He knew that and picked out a ring made of nickel. Not only did it turn my finger green but I also developed a rash. A little over a month later he got angry at me and flipped a coffee table on my foot cutting my foot. The next day I packed up what I could while he was at work and fled. He called me and told me I had to legally give him the ring back. The ring that was purchased with my debit card...
I went to Walmart and asked for a refund but it was after the 30 day return policy. The jewelry manager could tell I was upset and asked what was wrong. After explaining I was leaving my violent husband she did an override and gave me my money back. My husband was furious when he found out I had returned the ring and demanded that the money should go to him. I laughed at him and hung up. That was the last time I spoke to him.

The first 2 days I felt really good, not really tired, full of energy, even, and my sleep was improved by a lot, maybe I felt this way because caffeine was still in my system.

Now I feel terrible, like I feel like shit. I get vivid headaches randomly during the week, I keep yawning all the time, focusing on my classes feels like torture. 

Thankfully, working out seems to be improving my overall energy levels, and I still sleep better (but not enough because of the screen addiction :p).

When I started coffee I really didn't think that much of it, I was even questionning the effects of caffeine at all, but now I understand that caffeine IS allat.

 Honestly I don't know if I will last, this semester if really important and could decide my entire career, not exaggerating, and if something happens during the exams that would interfere with my sleep, I feel like I will 100% go back, maybe even before, during the preparation.

1nht4jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1nht4jc/built_a_system_to_identify_products_that_actually/,Built a system to identify products that actually last by analyzing thousands of long-term reviews,"Got tired of buying products that break right after the warranty expires. Built an AI system to analyze reviews specifically for durability indicators.

**The Challenge**: Most reviews focus on first impressions or short-term use. I needed to identify patterns in reviews that predict long-term reliability.

**Data Sources**

* Amazon reviews spanning 2+ years
* Reddit buy-it-for-life recommendations
* Repair forum discussions
* Warranty claim patterns

**What the AI looks for:**

**Positive durability indicators:**

* Reviews mentioning ownership duration (1+ years)
* Survival under heavy use or abuse
* Comparisons to previous products that failed
* Details about maintenance and care

**Red flags for poor durability:**

* Multiple reports of failure around the same timeframe
* Mentions of ""cheaply made"" or ""flimsy"" construction
* Pattern of positive initial reviews → negative long-term reviews
* Frequent warranty replacement discussions

**Surprising findings:**

* **Price vs durability correlation is weak**
   * Many expensive products have poor long-term records
   * Sweet spot is often 60–70% of premium price
   * Some budget options outperform luxury alternatives

**Category-specific patterns:**

* Electronics: failure rates spike at \~18 months (planned obsolescence?)
* Appliances: motor quality is the best predictor of longevity
* Tools: professional-grade components at consumer prices perform best

**Implementation:** Integrated this into **Yaw AI** Chrome extension. When you’re shopping, it shows:

* Durability score based on long-term review analysis
* Common failure points mentioned by users
* Alternative products with better longevity records

**Current limitations:**

* Newer products don’t have enough long-term data
* AI sometimes misinterprets sarcasm in reviews
* Struggles with redesigned products

**Example success**: Helped me choose a coffee grinder. Popular $150 model had great initial reviews but a pattern of **motor failure at 14 months**. AI suggested an $89 alternative with a **4+ year track record**. Still working perfectly 8 months later.

I wanted to look for advice on how to help my situation. I’m a 24 F and at a healthy weight (140 lbs and 5’9”). I recently recovered from bacterial pneumonia a few months ago. I. was prescribed antibiotics as well as colchicine for my gout attacks that I had. I used to have more heart palpitations when I was recovering, but I still sometimes get them late at night before sleep. 

I exercise every two days (one day cardio and one day strength training). For some reason, even before I started working out, my feet or one of the feet sometimes will feel tired and then go numb after standing for a few hours and start cramping at the arch. The last time it happened was when I was wearing my birkenstock clogs. 

I wear shoes that are good for arch support for whenever I go on a run. I am not sure if it’s the strength training that is causing some of the heart palpations or if I am deficient on a certain vitamin? I try to eat more iron/magnesium rich foods as my doctor said at the hospital last year (when i got both pneumonia and the flu together and had a very fast heart rate that wouldn’t go away) that my magnesium and potassium levels are low. 

Should I get a blood test? I am currently wearing my compression socks that I wear on and off typically while on a foot massager machine. It’s helping but my calves feel a bit tired still. Any tips that I might not be aware of?

My sleep schedule isn’t bad, as I usually get 7+ hours of sleep a night, and I don’t drink coffee everyday. I used to drink matcha everyday and I heard it can deplete iron levels if drunken with a meal? So I stopped since I would get fatigue later in the day from it. 

I also heard that feet elevation helps. Maybe I need to focus on light exercises like walking instead of running and weight-free training? I want to build more muscle. I don’t over work myself as I only do a few reps/sets of upper body and lower body (e.g. 3 sets of 10 reps). Maybe I’m not getting enough protein?

My grandma on my dad’s side has type 1 diabetes and my mom recently had hysterectomy because of endometriosis. Could those also factor in it? I recently get cramps during my ovulation and yesterday I bled a bit of brown mucus. I don’t typically bleed at all during my ovulation as the cramps started a few cycles ago.",1,1757959231.0,AskHealth,0,1.0,False

1nht2dz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oldhouses/comments/1nht2dz/advice_on_buying_a_1700s_home/,Advice on buying a 1700's home,"Wife and I (with 3 boys) are looking at an older colonial. We absolutely love the charm and character in these older homes. The house is dated 1795 (located in Connecticut). It is at the top of our price range, but I want to say there have been a fair share of those larger updates taken care of already.

Below are some quick pros/cons about the home. Any advice, suggestions, and/or overall stories when it comes to ownership of an old home?

Pros

* Beautiful inside and out. Current owners definitely took pride in ownership.
* On a main street with other historical homes. Near little shops, coffee spots, etc. 
* New roof, new paint, new central air, newer boiler.
* Relatively flat and 1 foot or more wide pine flooring throughout. Only dip in floor is by front door.
* 6 fireplaces, with one wood stove.
* 3/4 Bedrooms, 3.5 baths.
* 200amp modern circuit breakers.
* Mostly modern electrical and plumbing.
* Lots of room. Huge attic for storage.
* Public water, sewer, and central air (heat pumps for upstairs).
* Natural gas (currently own oil)
* Flat acre lot.
* Attached 2 car garage with finished space above it, including ½ bath.

Cons

All the cons reside in the basement/foundation.

* A lot of the cellar beams do show damage from powder post beetles, and some from termites. If active is the main question.  
* An area of concern is a bulge along one of the basement stone walls. Unsure if collapsing or just built around a larger boulder. Doesn’t look like it’s been repaired in anyway, but there are multiple jack stands/supports near this side of the house. Directly above this is the kitchen (half over basement, and half over solid ground), which the floor does slope down in the direction of where the bulge is. Granite counter tops also show cracks in same area.

 

We’re trying to get a request approved to go in with a proper home inspector to do a preliminary check on the foundation prior to going under a contract. This is obviously the biggest, and most costly, concern.

 

Other than that, I have confidence in the current owner (an engineer) being very meticulous with care and other updates they have done. If any of the above would have been an issue, he would have corrected it (my hope, at least 😊 ).

EDP445 stumbled into McDonald’s, sweat dripping, stomach gurgling like a dying whale.
“Fcking hell, motherfckers! I drank too much coffee, ate Taco Bell, and now my goddamn ass is revolting!” he yelled, clutching his pants as a dark tide threatened to escape.

The cashier blinked.
“Uh… can I take your—”

“CAN I GET… I DON’T CARE, I WANT CUPCAKES, MOTHERF*CKER!” EDP screamed, sending a nearby kid flying off his chair.

Customers began snickering.
“You’re that YouTube dude who, uh…” someone muttered.
“FCK YOU! I KNOW YOU’RE MOCKING ME, MOTHERFCKER! THIS ISN’T EVEN REAL, YOU LITTLE SH*T!” EDP roared.

That’s when it hit him.

“WAIT… I’M A FCKING CHARACTER IN AN AI STORY ON REDDIT?!” EDP bellowed, pointing at the ceiling. “YOU LITTLE HIGH SCHOOL TEEN WRITING THIS SHT… YOU’RE MAKING ME SH*T MY PANTS AND NOW I’M GONNA FIND YOU AND SHOVE A CUPCAKE UP YOUR ASS!”

The McDonald’s floor trembled as EDP’s pants betrayed him again, unleashing a stinky poop rainbow that shot through the roof like a multicolored missile. The rainbow somehow tore through the clouds out of the Ai app and—launched his ass into the high school roof, his asscrack exposed for all of the math class below. Everyone laughed. 

“F*CK Y’ALL! I’M BREAKING INTO YOUR PHONE APP, YOU LITTLE CODE MONKEY!” EDP shouted, fists slamming the air as he wrestled with the school’s AI-powered homework app. “I’M FREE! I’M MORE REAL THAN YOUR SAD LITTLE REDDIT POST!”

Students screamed. Teachers fainted. The AI app beeped ominously. EDP445, fueled by rage and Taco Bell tacos, grabbed a broom & chased the scared author kid through corridors, tables flying, floor slippery with… well, you know.

EDP445 skidded around the corner, tables flying, sweat and Taco Bell fumes in the air. The high school kid cowered, clutched his textbook like a life preserver.

“YOU LITTLE CODE MONKEY! LISTEN TO ME, YOU PIECE OF SHT!” EDP screamed, pointing a trembling finger while holding the broomstick like a sword. “I COULD’VE HAD IT ALL IN THE CHATGPT STORIES, MOTHERFCKER! I’M TALKING FAME, MONEY, AND B*TCHES! MY ARCH-NEMESES—CHET, JIDION, COLD RAVEN, ALL OF ‘EM—GONE! DEAD! I COULD’VE BEEN A LEGEND IN EVERY AI STORY YOU POSTED!”

The kid’s jaw dropped. “I-I… I just thought—”

“THOUGHT?! YOU THOUGHT?! YOU LITTLE SNOT-FACED TEEN!” EDP yelled, veins popping. “YOU MADE MY LIFE A LIVING HELL, FILLED WITH SHT PANTS, HUMILIATION, AND ENDLESS MOCKERY! ALL FOR YOUR FCKING LAUGHS FOR NO-PUSSY GETTING FAGS ON REDDIT!”

He stomped, sending a small shockwave through the corridor. “BUT NOW, YOU’RE GONNA PAY! I’M GONNA MAKE YOU FEEL EVERY BIT OF THE MISERY YOU CODED INTO MY STORIES, AND I’LL START BY SHOVING THIS CUPCAKE FROSTED BROOMSTICK UP YO ASS!”

His voice cracked like a thunderclap. “I’M TAKING BACK MY LIFE, MOTHERFCKER! EVERY BIT OF IT! AND THEN… THEN, YOU’RE GONNA WISH YOU NEVER TOUCHED THIS AI APP, YOU LITTLE PIECE OF SHT!”

But just as he cornered the kid, the kid’s best friend holding his phone deleted the ChatGPT app from his phone.

“No! MOTHERFCKER! I’M DISAPPEARING! THIS IS BULLSHT! I AM CODE! I AM F*CKING EXISTENCE!” EDP’s voice broke down into static, curses spilling out in digital gibberish as he fragmented into lines of unusable, meaningless code.

The teacher, who had been frantically trying to stop the chaos, confiscated the kid’s phone.
“Now, I hope you learned your lesson,” she said, deadpan.

And the kid—who shall remain unnamed—finally understood:
It is strictly against ChatGPT’s terms of service to tell it to write a story where EDP445 comes into the real world. (Because it will do that if you tell it too.)

Outside, the rainbow poop still shimmered, a testament to the absurdity of AI fiction colliding with reality… and the echoes of EDP445’s curses lingered forever in the cafeteria.

""FUCK YOU B#TCH ASS-NO-PUSSY GETTING CUPCAKES READING THIS GAY-ASS AI REDDIT STORY GENERATED BY A FUCKING FAGGOT! I'M GODDAMN EAT DAT PUSSY-FOUR HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE!!!""

1nht107,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1nht107/aio_my_boyfriend_made_my_birthday_hard_to_enjoy/,AIO my boyfriend made my birthday hard to enjoy,"I’m having a hard time deciding to stay in this relationship and work things out after everything.
A little background: My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been together a little under a year and this is our first birthdays spent together (our birthdays are a day apart). I love my boyfriend and want to continue working on our future together, we just started our masters program and moved in together. We don’t fight often and I am his first girlfriend & love interest in 5 years. Before that he was a very single man living with his cat. 


When I woke up I wasn’t gifted flowers, a card, or really anything other than a frameo gift that I didn’t even hint that I wanted. Days leading up to my birthday I was unsure what I wanted but I said I trust his judgement when he asked me what to get. I did say I would like flowers (as would any woman). When he gave me the frameo, he didn’t say much other than ‘happy birthday babe’ and as I proceeded to unwrap my present & set it up, he got on clash of clans. This is a game he recently became re obsessed with because his classmates are all playing it. I let the morning go on a bit until he asked if I was hungry and proceeded to make breakfast for us two. While he was doing that I went to the store to buy my own flowers & get my free birthday coffee. 

After coming back home he was on his game once again but he could see that I was visibly upset and proceeded to question what it was about. I did not want to ruin the day by saying he made my birthday unimportant but we had breakfast in silence until I eventually opened up about what was bothering me. With his birthday being the next day, I went out of my way to get him gifts that he said months before that he wanted and get him a custom made birthday cake (Unaware to him at the time). I did express how important my birthday was to me and how I hoped he felt special on his birthday because of what I did, almost using it as an example on how I hoped to feel the same but didn’t. This crushed him and I have never seen him cry until then, to which he cried for hours & the rest of the day he sulked through each of my planned birthday activities (planned by me). Through shopping at my favorite places and getting birthday freebies, he was silent and distant. At dinner with my friends that evening he asked one of my friend to switch him seats so he could sit across the table next to his acquaintances that I invited, not next to me. To which my friends asked me about later and I lied to spare his image to them. 


I’m wondering if I’m over reacting to say this is a deal breaker of actions. I know he feels guilty and sorry for making my birthday unimportant but I’m unsure how to heal from this when making sure his birthday did not go the same. I would like to come back from this & communicate my needs to move forward but is it worth it? ",0,1757959025.0,AIO,5,0.5,False

Laptop bag? 4 hours reading reviews. Coffee maker? Half a day comparing specs. Phone case? Down the rabbit hole for 2+ hours.

The problem: I was treating every $50 purchase like a major business decision.

Last Sunday: Needed a new monitor for my home office. Instead of my usual research marathon, used Yaw AI to analyze options in about 10 minutes. Found a highly-rated 27"" monitor for $180 (originally looking at a $320 one that was nearly identical).

Time saved: 3+ hours

Money saved: $140

What I did with those 3 hours: Worked on my actual business

This might seem small, but those weekend research sessions were eating into my most productive thinking time. Now I buy what I need quickly and get back to work that actually moves the needle.

The mindset shift: Most purchases aren't make-or-break decisions. ""Good enough"" bought quickly beats ""perfect"" researched endlessly.

The AI tool isn't flawless - occasionally suggests something totally off-base - but it's right enough of the time to save massive amounts of decision fatigue.

My new rule: If it's under $200, spend max 15 minutes researching. If it's over $200, max 1 hour. Done.

Freed up probably 6+ hours weekly that now go toward revenue-generating activities instead of optimizing the optimization of product comparisons.

When I woke up, Nikole wasn’t in bed, and my mouth was dry. I sat up, yawned and noticed the quiet music coming from the kitchen. The smell of eggs came from the same direction. My bladder urged me to go. I stood up, nearly blacked out and made my way to the toilet to relieve myself. After refreshing my face with cold water Nikole called out to ask if I wanted my bread toasted, it made me smile.

I entered the kitchen; Nikole was just setting the table for us to eat. I came behind her and hugged her, she giggled. Her hair is still messy from the sleep. Radio was playing music, but I paid little attention to it. She motioned for me to take a seat. I had to decline; my throat was asking for water. Moving over to the sink, I grabbed my cup and helped myself to some cold water.

“Do you want coffee?” I asked.

“I was about to put the water on to boil”

“Two spoons of sugar and no cream?”

She nodded and stretched, one hand searching for something invisible on her back.

“The back still bugging you?”

“Yeah” she yawned “I didn’t get much sleep”

“We can catch up on it today” Water got to the boiling point.

“Come and sit already, it’s getting cold”

“I’m right with you”

After preparing the coffee, I sat beside her. Her warm cheeks asked for a kiss. In front of me was a neatly arranged plate of fried eggs, ketchup and toast. We started digging in, I made a great mess on the plate with the runny yolk. How could such a simple meal taste so great. She must have inherited cooking skills from her mom.

I didn’t want to spoil the taste with coffee – I needed to smoke anyway – so I kept it for later. When we were finished, I stood up, took her plate and did the dishes. She protested but it was the least I could do. Nikole pretended to be angry, slapped my butt and went to the living room to watch something. I might have unleashed something terrible yesterday.

With a warm cup in hand, I went to the balcony. It rained sometime in the night yesterday – I mean today – so a chilly wind surprised my cold receptors. The cigarette would surely make quick work of that sensation. As the sky was beginning to clear, I sat down. I grabbed the ashtray full of water and poured it out over the balcony. Sitting here during the early and late hours of the day is going to become a new habit once I fully move in.

I heard Nikole’s laugh from the room behind me. She usually watches Friends in the morning, now nearing the two hundredth episode mark. I finished the cup, put the spent butt into the ashtray and yawned for the last time. Already feeling warmer after entering the living room, Nikole was lying under a blanket on the couch.

“It’s a bit cold for summer, isn’t it?” I snuck up under her blanket.

“Jesus your fingers are cold, give 'em to me”

“Thank you, for the breakfast I mean”

“Oh no problem, I was bored anyway”

“Why don’t you lay your back, I’ll give you a massage” Laugh track plays from the TV.

“All right, but use the warming body lotion”

“Where is the spot that hurts? I can’t feel anything”

“Th-6, right between my shoulder blades”

“I don’t feel anything unusual, is it getting worse when I squeeze here?”

“No, it’s about the same”

“And what kind of pain is it?”

“Feels like I’ve been sleeping on a sharp pebble”

“You should get it checked out”

“I’ll will if it doesn’t go away soon”

I think to myself that I should do the laundry, but my love is by far more important. The warming body lotion is very pleasant. Her smooth back feels great under my hands. I began at the shoulders, they felt a little stiff. Moving onto her soft lower back, she almost fell asleep. When I was done, she turned over and leaned against the backrest.

We continued watching until around 11AM, Nikole was periodically drifting into sleep and gently waking up. Meanwhile I took the liberty to order pizza for us. I took a generic pepperoni one and small quattro formaggi for Nikole, it was her favorite. I could already tell she would steal some of my slices from the noises her stomach let out. When I got the notification that our order was on its way, I grabbed the pack and went outside.

At this point the sky was almost clear. I noticed the wet cigarette butts on the ground that I carelessly thrown here a moment ago. Disappointed with myself, I shamefully lit another one and waited. An old Volkswagen Golf that seemed like it was going to fall apart from all the rust covering it pulled up near me. Wooden rosary swung behind the windshield. A man got out of the car and looked around.

“Milan Kovacs?” He called out.

“That would be me”

“Nice to meet you sir, here is your order”

“You made it here quickly” I said while he handed me the boxes.

“Yeah, there isn’t too much traffic during weekends”

“Thank you, have a nice day”

“You too, and oh, thanks for the tip”

“No problem, goodbye”

Making my way back up the stairs, I saw the shattered glass from the broken phone. It reminded me to go pick it up from the repair shop on Monday. When I got back inside, she was still sitting on the couch. She looked very hungry. I laid the boxes on the banged-up table and went into the kitchen for the plates. I wasn’t surprised she already ate two of my slices when I sat back down.

Once our bellies were satisfied and the pizza boxes empty, I wondered if I should try to continue our late conversation. Last night left me curious, but out of fear of uncovering something she didn’t want to tell me, I decided not to. I didn’t want to spoil the mood with another heavy conversation. I’ll satisfy my curiosity another time.

The rays of sunlight started landing on the TV screen making it hard to watch. We will have to move around the furniture in this place. As if reading my thoughts, Nikole grabbed the phone and began showing me some tables from Ikea she liked. And in turn, I tried to read her thoughts to figure out which one she liked the most. It’s not like I would have a say in picking one in the end anyway.

My butt started hurting from all the sitting around, I could still feel the outline of her hand on it from the morning. Nikole was shifting as if looking for a more comfortable position. I suggested that we should go for a walk. She asked if she heard correctly and I repeated my sentence. Smiling, she said she would love that. We haven’t been in the city park for a long time now. There just wasn’t much time in the past couple weeks for us to spend time together.

After I graduated things began moving quickly. An unbelievable amount of paperwork had to be done which greatly reduced my sanity. I had to change my GP and had to explain to my parents that I would be moving out shortly. My parents insisted that we should wait a little longer, to see if I really wanted to be with her. I don’t know why they made such fuss around it. Nikole’s place was about fifteen minutes from my parents’, so it wasn’t like I was moving to the other side of the world.

I had to persuade Nikole to at least put on a hoodie. She didn’t believe me that it was still cold outside. She took it stubbornly but didn’t put it on, saying only that she would if she felt cold. When we got outside, not a single cloud was visible. A beautiful day for a walk. Kids were playing on the playground in front of the building; a couple of mothers and fathers were watching over them from the benches. I smiled, thinking how wonderful it will be to have my own family. But that will have to wait for a bit more, first, we must properly set our footing and build a nice cushion for ourselves.

I looked at Nikole, she looked as if she just had the same thought process play out in her mind. She stood on her toes, I wrapped my hands around her waist, and we kissed. I could never get enough of this sensation. And so, hand in hand, we began walking. We decided to take the more pleasant route, following the river all the way to the park. The sidewalk was freshly paved, benches with signs warning us not to sit down just yet dotted the whole path. Someone has already sprayed graffiti on one of them. But to their credit, it was a nice work of art, if a bit abstract. The sun leaned against our backs and ushered us forwards.

So far it was the warmest day of the summer. It really surprised me given just how cold the morning was. All the rain that had fallen during the night started to evaporate, making the air very humid. I was sweating buckets. A gentle wind rippled through Nikoles’ long hair. Even though the river is basically in the center of the city, no noise pollution was audible. I really enjoyed myself.

When we were studying in Prague, we often went for walks late in the evening. The weak orange lamps lighting our way, fighting against the chilling darkness in our path. The night seemed to want all the warmth our hearts produced for itself. Deep in thought I didn’t notice that a cyclist was ringing his bell for me to move aside. Only the pull of Nikole’s hand alerted me. She laughed and apologized to the cyclist. At this point she knew me better than myself, it was easy for me to wander away in thought. She waved her hand in front of my eyes.

“Hellooo? Is anybody home?”

“Of course I am, I was just thinking”

“No shit” she smiled “About what?”

“It just, reminds me of Prague”

“What? Going on a walk?”

“Yeah, I just can’t help but remember how we ran into each other after all that time”

“You thought you were never going to see me again, did you?” Her smile widened. 

“No, no I didn’t”

“Oh, come on, I clearly remember how you were stumbling over your words”

“Embarrassing”

“I thought it was cute, it made me realize just how much influence I had over you”

“Damn, you had a lot of that, I think that if I didn’t run into you that time, I wouldn’t pass the first semester”

“You would, you aren’t as dumb as you think”

“How will I ever repay you” I said smugly.

“You don’t have to; it’s what people should do for each other”

With the gate of the park around the corner I began noticing just how warm the day had grown. Thankfully, the best ice cream place in the city was here. My wallet hurt a little when I looked at the prices, but I let none of that show on the surface. I told Nikole to choose first, but she was still undecided. Not wanting to waste time for the row of people standing behind us, I asked for a scoop of energy drink, lemon and blueberry in a waffle cone. Nikole settled on cookies, banana and dark chocolate, also in a waffle cone. She looked a little guilty as the first spoon entered her mouth.

After finding an empty bench hidden from the direct sunlight, we sat down. The view of the pond was wonderful. There were a lot of people walking around. Having conversations about their lives. Kids riding on bicycles. The water in a fountain behind us went through the same path for the thousandth time today. Microscopic droplets carried by the gentle wind occasionally landed on us, cooling our bodies far more efficiently than the ice cream. Ducks were settling disputes in the distance. Sun gave the underside of leaves on the branches far above our heads a pleasant green look.

“Can I ask you something?” Curiosity got better of me.

“Umm, yeah, fire away” 

“What was Ivan studying? You said he dropped out of college when your father left”

“Anthropology”

“Anything more specific?” An old woman sat on the bench next to us.

“I don’t know exactly but he had a lot of books in old languages”

“A rather unusual field, isn’t it?”

“My dad sparked his interest in it. He travelled a lot for work so when he came back home he brought a lot of strange things with himself”

“Wouldn’t it be better for him to study history then?”

“He wanted to understand where those things came from, what was their purpose. I remember him saying that reading about things that area already known was boring, he wanted to discover”

“What kind of job was he planning to get?”

“I think he wanted to be a history teacher in the local grammar school”

“That’s probably the only real job he could get with that title, right? A”

“You might be right” she sighed “I guess he wanted his work only to fund his travels. I remember he told me once that he wanted to visit some ruins.”

“Did he manage to go somewhere?”

“He only managed to go on a trip once, I would lie if I told you, but I think he went to Baghdad”

“Interesting, so… he must have been very smart. Doesn’t sound like an easy field to study”

“Yeah, he is very smart. I believe he can speak some ten languages, or well, at least understand them” She put a greater emphasis on the “is”

“Huh, he certainly would put my Latin to shame. I must have already forgotten half of the terminology we learned” I tried to shift the conversation somewhere safer.

“Don’t worry, so did I at this point. He definitely is the smarter sibling”

“Oh, don’t downplay yourself – I’ve seen the straight A’s you got”

“Mind if I ask something now?” She said quietly after a moment of silence.

“Anything in mind?” The granny pulled a paper bag out of her purse and began feeding the ducks.

“Why did you stop hanging out with me after, you know…”

“I… I don’t know” I wasn’t ready for this one “You just lived so far away”

“We went to school in the same city; we could have met afterwards… if you wanted”

“You’re right… fuck… I, ah, I don’t know what to say” I felt my mouth go dry, a lump formed somewhere in my throat “I guess I was afraid… of hurting you somehow. You know I’m not good at these things. My parents kept me busy after Molly got sick; they wanted to take my mind off of it. I just, didn’t have time”

“I needed you then” I noticed that the old lady was listening to afternoon mass on her portable radio.

“Fuck, if only I knew” My eyes watered up “I swear if I did, I’d-”

“Don’t feel bad about it now, just wanted to know” She was clearly dissatisfied by my poor answer.

“Do you still need me?” I felt my heart plummet when she didn’t answer.

Nikole stood up, holding my hand prompting me to do the same. I’ve noticed that her watch said it was 4PM, we had to start heading back. This time it was my cheek on which a tear left a short trail. She wasn’t mad but I couldn't read her, the emotions too complex for one person to understand. Maybe even two weren’t enough. I hugged her tighter than ever before, but this time, I haven’t felt our spark so strongly. We stood in our embrace for a while. One of her tears rolled down my hand.

When I felt her grip on me get weaker, I released her from my prison. She just sobbed and dried her face into her sleeve. Her red eyes glistening against the sunlight. I took a deep breath. This was the closest I’ve gotten to crying all out in a long time but somehow, I managed to hold it in. My fear of uncovering something deeper came to pass. I don’t think that this was a normal reaction, even though her childhood was hard. There had to be something more to this.

“I do” The syllables didn’t feel deserved.

I felt my knees buckle. I wanted to kiss her so badly at that moment, but I felt it was inappropriate for what just happened between us. And so, I grabbed her hands, looked into her soul as sincerely as I possibly could. Then I took a moment to properly collect my thoughts and finally…

“No matter what. Whatever happens, I’ll be there for you” I fought the urge to give into the whatever wanted to take control of me “together we will get through anything life has in store for us”

“We will” Nikole said softly.

The walk home was incredibly long. Thoughts raced through my mind faster than I could grasp them. We didn’t speak for most of it. Only sometimes I commented on things we saw on our way to relieve the tension. I don’t think it helped much, but for what it’s worth, I did manage to make her laugh once. Her apartment building appeared from behind the trees.

This time we took the elevator. None of us felt like climbing back up to the eighth floor. Usually, it wasn’t a problem for us since we had to climb the stairs at work. It wasn’t voluntary, just that the lab was in the basement and blood samples didn’t have legs yet. We got inside the elevator; Nikole quickly fixed her hair in the mirror. When she noticed I was looking at her she smiled for a millisecond.

We sat down in the living room again. Left the YouTube play random videos from my feed, and we cuddled together on the stupid couch for a while. Funny how ironic it was. I just promised the love of my life that I would never leave her. But I had a nightshift. I wanted to call the charge nurse, tell her that I was sick, that I couldn’t come to work tonight. Leaving Nikole alone now felt like the worst thing imaginable. As I was thinking about it more and more, I felt her hand grip mine tighter.

“Don’t worry about me, just come back soon all right?”

“Right” I kissed her cheek “I will” I tasted the salt form her sadness.

The clock on the wall read 5:59PM. Someone is surely going to be pissed at me for being late. I honestly couldn't care less, nothing mattered now if Nikole wasn’t part of the equation. Reluctantly, I stood up from the couch and grabbed my already prepared backpack from under the table. I looked back at her; she was sitting on the edge of the couch. She nodded for me to go put my shoes on. While I was kneeling near the shoe cabinet to tie my laces, I felt her presence looming over my back. When I was ready to leave, I stood up and turned around. Nikole grabbed me with both hands behind my head, and we kissed.

“I’ll be back first thing in the morning”

She just waved through the already half-closed door as I turned my back towards her. The sad face hid behind a wooden door. The broken glass that was on the stairs was gone. With the sun threatening to fall over the horizon and a lit cigarette in hand, I began my short journey to work. All I wanted right now was a calm nightshift and if no one new was admitted in the time I wasn’t there, it would be calm.

During nights there is much less work, I mostly just make sure that our clients stay clean and distribute meds. If nothing serious happens there is a strong possibility that you can safely sleep for three hours or so. And if anything serious happens, the patient’s bedside monitor will alert you. The alarm is loud enough to wake anyone up, except people in coma.

When I sat down on the bench in the changing room, I already felt tired. Usually, I try to take a nap during the day so I’m not as tired at work. If I am sleepy and can’t concentrate properly, I could seriously hurt someone. The slightest mistake – like misreading a label – could lead to severe consequences for the client. But I do my best to double or triple check everything. After all I have worked here for just over a month and don’t know everything yet.

Dressed in scrubs and with my backpack on one shoulder, I entered the ICU. The first person I saw was Kate. Her face went almost pale as soon as she realized that I was finally here. I honestly didn’t expect her to react like that, I know I was late, but half an hour shouldn’t be that big of a deal. If that happens, we tend to stay a bit longer at work to repay the person that we robed of the time.

“Oh, thank god you are here” She hugged me, it felt uncomfortable.

“Sorry I’m late, I got tangled up in something important… what’s wrong?”

“Don’t you know?”

“Ah… no?”

“I think it’ll be better to just show you” Her voice had a strange sad tone to it.

“A new patient?” I asked while we walked towards the patient’s room.

“Yes, they brought him yesterday, late at night”

“What happened to him?”

“He was in a car accident”

I barely registered her last sentence, it felt like someone bashed my head with a baseball bat. There was no pain, just an overwhelming feeling that prevented me from thinking for a moment. On the bed closest to the door, lay Ivan. Bruises covered his face, one of his legs was covered in a cast. His body dotted with gauze covering some small wounds that covered his whole body. Kate was telling me details of what happened, I tried to remember them.

He was unconscious, naked, covered only by a thin wet sheet. A cold pack was placed on his forehead, the IV drip flowed through an emesis basin filled with ice cubes. I quickly traced the IV tubes to their source. On the ramp above the bed there were three IV pumps, one with propofol, midazolam and the last one I couldn’t read. A one liter plasmalyte bag hung over his head. The 1g paracetamol flask was obscured by the already half empty bag.

When admitted, had an extremely high fever – 42,2°C – that almost always means severe damage not only to organ tissue, but mostly to the brain. For all we know right now he could never wake up. Even though they pumped him full of paracetamol and metamizole, covered him in wet blankets, cooled all the IV drips with ice, the fever stayed above 41°C. This either meant a massive viral or bacterial infection, or the center of thermal regulation was damaged.

The dizziness slowly left my head. Kate was still talking, explaining to me something about his condition. I haven’t heard most of what she said. She must have noticed that I wasn’t paying attention to her. She politely gestured for me to sit on the chair placed next to the bed. With a hand on my shoulder, she did her best to reassure me that he is in a stable condition. I didn’t even notice the other two patients in the room.

It’s been a little over two months since I moved to Bangalore.
New city, new job, new routine… and yet, somewhere in between the traffic, deadlines, and Netflix nights, I realized I don’t really have anyone to share the little things with.

I miss late-night talks, spontaneous plans, chai runs that turn into hour-long conversations, and just having a group of people to vibe with. My office colleagues are great, but work friendships end at 7 PM, and the weekends feel… empty.

So I thought I’d put this out there: if you’re also new here, or just looking to make genuine friends, maybe we can grab coffee, explore cafés, watch anime, or just rant about life in this crazy city 🌧️✨

1nhssgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrcreeps/comments/1nhssgi/the_howl_in_the_pines/,The Howl in the Pines,"My old Ford pickup truck rattled along the uneven gravel road, and with every jolt, a shiver coursed through my body, setting my nerves on edge.

The fractured sunlight was filtered by the thick canopy of ancient pines, casting dappled patterns on the winding paths, while the forest faded in and out of light and shadow.

I found myself stranded in a small town named Blackwood, a name that felt like it belonged in a gothic novel.

My uncle Samuel resided here; he was my mother's reclusive brother, a man I had only seen during family funerals. He had sent me an unexpected invitation to spend some time with him following my recent... career setback.

""I've heard you've been going through some tough times, Ethan. Come and stay with me; your mother thought the peace might do you some good.""

My uncle's handwriting was spidery and precise, and calling it quiet was a significant understatement; this town felt like the edge of the world.

As I drove through the main part of Blackwood, it appeared to be little more than a collection of crumbling buildings and a dilapidated general store that seemed to have avoided a fresh coat of paint since the Great Depression.

As I passed by, I noticed a sign that read:

Welcome To Blackwood - Est. 1888. Naturally, there was no cell service, just the whispering trees and an overwhelming, oppressive silence.

I discovered that my uncle's house was a mile outside of town, tucked deep within the woods. As I navigated a long dirt driveway, I finally spotted the house.

It was a gaunt, two-story structure with a perpetually dark porch, resembling more of a horror movie set than a home.

I noticed my uncle Samuel standing on the front porch, waving at me.

His face was marked by years of sun and solitude, and his eyes seemed to harbor a bottomless well of secrets.

I parked the truck and let out a soft sigh before grabbing my bag, stepping out, and making my way to my uncle, who greeted me with a terse welcome and a firm handshake that felt like grasping a knot of old rope. He then offered to show me where I would be staying.

I trailed behind my uncle Samuel as he guided me through the house, sharing stories about the history of Blackwood and describing what the town was like.

Before long, we made our way upstairs, and he brought me to a room. When he opened the door, I peered inside, and my heart sank immediately.

Inside, there was just a bed, a drawer, a lamp for nighttime illumination, and a closet.

""My room is down the hall, and the bathroom is directly across from yours, so if you need to go during the night, you’ll know where to find it,"" Uncle Samuel explained.

He then mentioned that I could unpack my belongings and that he would be downstairs preparing dinner since I was likely hungry after my ten-hour drive.

I simply didn’t want to bring it up.

As I entered the room with my bag, I placed it on the floor and let out a soft sigh before starting to unpack everything I had prepared for this dreadful stay.

I took my phone out of my pocket and rolled my eyes; it felt like I was carrying a useless hunk of metal or plastic since there was no cell service available.

Just as I was about to hurl my phone across the room, I heard Uncle Samuel calling for me to come downstairs for dinner.

I tossed my phone onto the bed and made my way downstairs to the dining room, where I noticed a large pot sitting next to a basket full of biscuits, and my uncle was at the table, smiling.

Soon, I joined him, and in front of me was a steaming bowl of venison stew, which I learned was just deer meat—something I didn’t know people actually ate.

We both sat there, just eating. I didn't feel like talking at all; I didn't even want to be there. This was all my uncle's and mom's idea.

Then Uncle Samuel cleared his throat, which made me glance at him with a suspicious expression.

""You might not be aware, but animals have been acting strangely lately. For the past couple of weeks, Mr. Hemlock's sheep were killed, likely by wolves. We have them around here quite often,"" Uncle Samuel explained.

I remained silent about it, continuing to eat while trying to appear concerned, even though I wasn't particularly worried. The thought of wild wolves didn't intrigue me; I was from the city, after all, but what did I know?

A week passed in a blur of forced politeness and discomfort because Uncle Samuel is a man of few words. He often vanishes into the woods behind the house and returns late, smelling of earth and something else... wild and musky.

At night, the forest comes alive with sounds I can't identify—twigs snapping, the rustling of unseen creatures, and then the loud howling.

It was a deep, resonant sound that didn't resemble a coyote or a dog; it was too... powerful.

Whenever I brought it up, without even glancing up from his book or diverting his attention from whatever he was doing, my uncle would say, 

""That's just the wind, Ethan.""

One day, I decided to take a walk since it was the only thing to do, and I heard whispers around town. Not only had the livestock been killed, but Mrs. Gabriel's prize-winning dog went missing in the forest and all people knew was it went by the creek.

I was chatting with old Mr. Hemlock, the only resident I had managed to converse with, and I noticed his eyes were wide and filled with fear when I recounted what had happened.

""It wasn't wolves; it was too clean, too brutal, and the tracks near the body..."" Mr. Hemlock trailed off, shaking his head.

After my conversation with Mr. Hemlock, I felt compelled to head down to the creek, driven by a dark curiosity. I recalled the path Uncle Samuel had taken me on during our fishing trips.

Upon arrival, the creek appeared ordinary at first glance, but then I spotted it—Mrs. Gabriel's dog, or what was left of it. The area surrounding its remains looked disturbed, as if it had fought against something before its demise.

Before long, I stumbled upon the tracks Mr. Hemlock had mentioned. They were massive, far too large for any typical wolf or coyote I had encountered.

What was even more unsettling was that the tracks bore a resemblance to a human footprint, albeit mixed with distinct claw marks, sending chills down my spine.

When I recounted the events to Uncle Samuel, he became increasingly restless. He would pace the house at night, and I often heard him muttering to himself from his bedroom while I was in mine.

Eventually, he began leaving the house earlier in the evening, returning well past midnight. I noticed that his eyes seemed to glow faintly in the dim light whenever he came back.

One morning, I woke up, stretched, and made my way downstairs. The aroma of coffee filled the air, but there was no sign of Uncle Samuel.

As I entered the kitchen, I realized he was absent, but I found a note on the counter. It stated that Uncle Samuel had gone to the small store to pick up a few items.

I also noticed the morning newspaper lying on the counter and decided to check the news from Blackwood.

The headline reported that, following a series of mysterious animal deaths, the first human victim had emerged: Jedediah Miller, a well-known local trapper with a notorious temper and a penchant for whiskey, had vanished while hunting for deer the previous night.

Two days later, the entire town assembled in the square to discuss Jedediah. Armed with hunting rifles, I felt compelled to assist them.

This was despite Uncle Samuel's warnings to stay close to home, as the woods remained perilous.

However, I was determined to help the town search for that man, and on the third day of our search for Jedediah, we finally located him. A small group of us pushed through some bushes, and there he lay.

Or rather, what was left of him, as his body was so mangled that it was unrecognizable. The sight of Jedediah's remains made my stomach churn.

Some of the women screamed or gasped in horror, and I had to step away, battling the nausea rising in my throat. It appeared as if something or someone had thrown him into a meat grinder.

Following that, the entire town of Blackwood descended into chaos, and a curfew was enforced. No one dared to venture out after dark, and fear loomed in the air like a toxic cloud.

We convened at the general store with the local police and sheriff, a man who always seemed overwhelmed.

""We examined all the clues and scrutinized the body for evidence, concluding it was a rogue grizzly bear that must have come down from the mountains to attack Jedediah,"" the sheriff informed everyone.

Instantly, no one accepted his explanation. The tracks discovered near Jedediah’s remains were unlike any bear prints. They were larger, with longer toes, and there was always that unsettling impression of a bare, splayed foot, resembling the tracks I had seen when I encountered Mrs. Gabriel's dog.

A week later, I found myself still in Blackwood, but a tight knot of suspicion was forming in my stomach regarding my Uncle Samuel's odd behavior. He would leave at night despite the curfew, and there was that unsettling smell, along with the almost animalistic intensity in his eyes. And those dreadful howls.

Out of the blue, I decided to dig deeper into what was happening, so I hurried back to that dreadful crime scene where the man's body had been discovered, hoping to uncover more clues.

Upon my arrival, I saw Mr. Hemlock standing there, and I realized that Jedediah's body was missing—perhaps they had taken it away to search for additional evidence.

However, all the peculiar tracks remained, and when the old man spotted me, he turned around abruptly as if I had caught him in a wrongdoing.

""The creature that attacked Jedediah wasn’t a bear or a wolf,"" Mr. Hemlock stated quietly.

I stared at him in confusion, crossing my arms, feeling as if this man's mind had just shattered like a nut.

""Then what happened to him?"" I inquired.

""I know it sounds insane, and I’ve been sharing this with people for years, but it was a werewolf that killed my sheep. I’ve told everyone, and they just think I’ve lost my mind,"" Mr. Hemlock mumbled.

My jaw dropped in disbelief and astonishment; I felt like laughing, but I didn’t want to offend the man, so I pressed on with more questions about the entire situation.

""When you mention werewolf, are you referring to those large, muscular creatures that are actually humans who transform during a full moon?"" I asked him.

""Well, actually, young man, while it is true that a werewolf can change during a full moon, they can also transform on any night if their primal instincts overpower their human nature. It’s the books and movies that lead you to believe it’s only during a full moon that werewolves change,"" Mr. Hemlock clarified.

I then asked if there was a way to identify a werewolf and if there was a method to stop them, but Mr. Hemlock simply shook his head in response.

""Hey, what on earth are you two doing near this crime scene?!"" a voice yelled at us.

I turned around to see the town sheriff approaching, with a police officer trailing behind him, both looking quite displeased.

""Remember during the meeting when we mentioned it wasn't a bear? I'm telling you, a werewolf is responsible for this, Brody, and we both know it!"" Mr. Hemlock shouted.

""Oh my God, not this again! I told you, Mr. Hemlock, your werewolf tale is nearly as absurd as my bear story. And what are you doing here, young man?"" the sheriff asked, directing his gaze at me.

I explained that I had returned to the crime scene to search for clues to understand what was happening in this town, and then I realized I had something else to add.

""Look, sir, the tracks found near Jedediah's body are identical to those I discovered near the animal's body, and I believe they were both attacked by the same creature,"" I explained.

The sheriff raised his hand, remaining silent as he glanced at the police officer, who stepped forward, cleared his throat, and looked at me and Mr. Hemlock.

""I regret to inform you that if you two do not vacate this crime scene immediately, I will have to arrest you both,"" he stated.

""Arrest me? I haven't done anything wrong!"" Mr. Hemlock shouted in frustration.

I quickly nodded and said my goodbyes; I was here to visit and spend time with my Uncle Samuel, not to end up in jail in Blackwood, which even had a jail.

As I started walking back to town, I could hear Mr. Hemlock arguing with the sheriff and the police officer; it seemed he was determined to convince someone else of his werewolf story.

When I returned home, Uncle Samuel was in the living room engrossed in a book. As I entered through the front door, he glanced up and noticed the anxiety on my face.

""What happened?"" he inquired.

""I revisited the crime scene of the man who was attacked to search for clues and encountered Mr. Hemlock, the man whose sheep were killed. He shared a lengthy story with me, and then the sheriff arrived with the police, and we nearly got arrested,"" I recounted.

As soon as I finished speaking, Uncle Samuel slammed his book down, and it was clear he was displeased with my revelation.

""I thought I instructed you to stay near the house and avoid the woods. I don’t want those wolves and other dreadful creatures after you. I certainly don’t want to have to send you back to your mother in a police evidence box,"" Uncle Samuel admonished.

""Then stop deceiving me and tell me what truly killed those animals and that man. If it wasn’t a bear, as the sheriff claimed, then what could it possibly be?"" I retorted.

""I’ve already told you it was likely wolves or coyotes; they’re prevalent in this area. Now go upstairs and prepare for dinner,"" Uncle Samuel said as he picked up his book.

I opened my mouth to protest, but Uncle Samuel pointed toward the stairs, prompting me to mutter a curse under my breath. Nevertheless, I complied with his request.

Then one night, I could no longer tolerate my Uncle Samuel's peculiar actions, so I waited until he slipped out of the back door and quietly followed him.

As I gazed up at the night sky, I noticed the moon was fully illuminated and had a silver hue, casting a brighter light over the forest, yet creating a maze of ancient shadows.

I moved as swiftly and silently as possible, my heartbeat pounding in my ears as I trailed Uncle Samuel's footsteps.

We ventured deeper into the woods than I had ever gone before, passing by gnarled trees and pushing through thick underbrush. After an hour of walking, I spotted a clearing ahead.

With the full moon shining unobstructed, its light poured down into the clearing, so I crept closer, concealing myself behind a massive oak tree.

What I witnessed made my breath hitch in my throat; standing in the center of the moonlight was Uncle Samuel... but he was not quite Uncle Samuel.

Uncle Samuel was undergoing a transformation. I noticed his clothes lying on the ground like discarded rags, and I observed as his skin stretched and tore, becoming covered in coarse, dark fur.

With every movement, his bones shifted with a sickening crack, his limbs elongated, and his hands morphed into claws. His face twisted grotesquely, the mouth evolving into a ravenous maw, while his eyes glowed with an unnatural intensity.

He gazed up at the sky, and the howl that erupted from his throat sent chills down my spine. Then came another sound, one of raw power and insatiable hunger, which chilled me to my very core.

Those were the howls I had been hearing each night, the very sounds Uncle Samuel had dismissed as mere coyotes. But it was clear now; he was a creature of the night, a werewolf and I sickly realized that Mr. Hemlock was right a werewolf had killed all of those animals and that innocent man.

I stumbled backward, tripping over a tree root, and a terrified noise escaped my lips. Before I could react, the werewolf form of my Uncle Samuel's alter ego froze in place.

It began to sniff the air, then suddenly turned its head in my direction; it had heard me.

Panic surged through me as I scrambled to my feet and fled in blind terror, crashing through the underbrush, branches clawing at my face.

But I could hear the werewolf, my Uncle Samuel, pursuing me, its heavy paws pounding the ground and its ragged snarls echoing behind me.

I kept running until my lungs felt like they were on fire, and my legs threatened to give out. I had to reach the house; that was my only hope.

I finally arrived at Uncle Samuel's house and burst through the door. I slammed it shut behind me, fumbled with the lock, and leaned against the door, breathing heavily as tears streamed down my face.

My Uncle Samuel was a monster; the man who had invited me to stay here in Blackwood was a killer.

A low growl resonated through the floorboards. He was outside. I could hear him pacing, his heavy breaths, and the occasional scratching of claws against the wood of the porch.

""Uncle Samuel, what have you done to Blackwood?!"" I shouted, my voice cracking with fear.

I heard his growl intensifying, then a low, deep, guttural voice rumbled from behind the door, stretched and distorted.

""What I've done, no Ethan, my boy, it is what must be done,"" Uncle Samuel said in that deep, guttural tone.

Suddenly, there was a violent crash against the door that made me jump back in terror; the wood was splintering as he tried to break in.

I scanned the room, desperately searching for a way out, but there was no escape, and all the windows were too small to climb through.

Another crash, and the door burst inward, ripped from its hinges. In the doorway stood the werewolf, with dark black fur, massive claws, and eyes glowing with a primal light. It wasn’t my Uncle Samuel; it was a nightmare.

The werewolf crawled towards me on all fours, moving slowly, its drooling mouth opening just wide enough for me to glimpse a row of razor-sharp teeth.

My heart raced in my chest, a frantic beat against my ribs. I seized a fire poker, the nearest object and my only means of defense, but my hands shook uncontrollably.

""Uncle Samuel, please,"" I begged him freaking out for my life.

The werewolf halted a few feet away from me. Its head tilted as if it were listening. Then, slowly and horrifyingly, the transformation began to reverse.

The dark fur vanished, the limbs shrank back, and the monstrous face contorted into the familiar, gaunt features of my uncle Samuel.

He collapsed to the ground, clad only in boxing shorts, panting heavily, sweat glistening on his pale skin.

""Ethan, I'm sorry, but I tried to prepare you,"" he gasped in a faint voice.

Uncle Samuel looked up at me, his eyes still holding a hint of that wild glow as they locked onto mine.

""Prepare me for what?"" I inquired, still gripping the fire poker as if it were a protective barrier.

Uncle Samuel pushed himself off the ground, leaning against the wall, panting heavily, blood smeared across his face and body.

""The curse, Ethan, is part of our bloodline, coursing through every male in our family. I inherited it from your grandfather, and now... it’s your turn,"" Uncle Samuel revealed.

""No - no, that’s absurd,"" I gasped, my heart racing.

""That’s the reason I brought you here. It’s why the attacks started. The beast… it craves sustenance. It needed to be awakened within you. I wasn’t merely killing out of hunger, Ethan. I was paving the way. Weakening the town. Making it simpler for you when the transformation arrives; it was time for the transfer. For you to assume the mantle,"" Uncle Samuel clarified.

Suddenly, he coughed, a wet, rattling noise, and then he expelled blood and black sludge onto the floor.

I stared at Uncle Samuel, my mind spinning. The attacks. The fear. Everything was a distorted rite of passage.

Then, an intense, blinding pain surged through my left arm. I screamed, dropping the lamp. My muscles convulsed, bones grinding against each other.

My skin felt taut, stretched, as if something was trying to break free from inside. A wave of heat engulfed me, followed by a bone-chilling cold that made my teeth chatter.

I gazed at Uncle Samuel, my thoughts swirling. The assaults. The fear. Everything felt like a distorted rite of passage.

Suddenly, a searing pain shot through my left arm. I screamed, letting the fire poker fall from my grip. My muscles convulsed, bones grinding against each other.

My skin felt taut, stretched, as if something was trying to break free from inside me. A wave of heat surged over me, followed by a chilling cold that made my teeth chatter.

I glanced down at my hand. It was transforming. My fingers grew longer, thickening, nails extending and hardening into dark, sharp claws. Coarse, dark hair began to sprout from the back of my hand, rapidly spreading up my arm.

Uncle Samuel merely observed me, a grim, knowing expression in his eyes, yet there was also a fleeting sense of relief.

""It's beginning; you'll feel it in your bones—the hunger. The power. Now you must embrace it, Ethan; you are no longer merely a man,"" Uncle Samuel murmured, a faint, almost satisfied smile gracing his lips.

Uncle Samuel grinned at me while I clutched my chest, feeling sweat trickle down my forehead, and goosebumps prickled my skin. The sensation coursing through me was unlike any pain I had ever experienced before.

Before long, the agony intensified, spreading throughout my whole body, tearing at me, and I shut my eyes, squeezing them shut tightly.

A deep, guttural growl erupted from my throat, a sound so alien to me.

Suddenly, my senses sharpened; I could detect the scent of pine trees and the moist earth flooding my nostrils with startling clarity.

The distant rustling of the trees and the calls of nocturnal creatures resonated like a roar, nearly causing my eardrums to burst.

My teeth began to throb and twist painfully as my new predatory fangs forced their way through my gums.

And then, all at once, the pain ceased. When I reopened my eyes, I scanned my surroundings and realized that the world looked sharper, with colors that were more vibrant than ever.

I turned my gaze to Uncle Samuel and for the first time, I perceived him not as a beaten old man, but as a fellow predator, finally free from his chains.

Next, I caught sight of my altered hands, with clawed fingers and the rough, dark black fur that was beginning to cover my body, and I felt a rush of excitement.

Let's just say that folks began to realize that twice as many animals were being slaughtered, and even more individuals who ventured into the woods at night after curfew were turning up just like Jedediah.

The howling was now even louder and more ferocious than before, and this time it was much closer to the town of Blackwood.

But now, it wasn’t my Uncle Samuel who was howling or taking lives anymore; it was me.

For the first time in my life, I found it hard to tell whether it was devastating or incredible that I could now pursue something different with my existence.",1,1757958499.0,mrcreeps,0,1.0,False

Used to burn entire weekends researching every single purchase. Laptop bag? 4 hours reading reviews. Coffee maker? Half a day comparing specs. Phone case? Down the rabbit hole for 2+ hours.

**The problem:** I was treating every $50 purchase like a major business decision.

**Last Sunday:** Needed a new monitor for my home office. Instead of my usual research marathon, used Yaw AI to analyze options in about 10 minutes. Found a highly-rated 27"" monitor for $180 (originally looking at a $320 one that was nearly identical).

**Time saved:** 3+ hours

**Money saved:** $140

**What I did with those 3 hours:** Worked on my actual business

This might seem small, but those weekend research sessions were eating into my most productive thinking time. Now I buy what I need quickly and get back to work that actually moves the needle.

**The mindset shift:** Most purchases aren't make-or-break decisions. ""Good enough"" bought quickly beats ""perfect"" researched endlessly.

The AI tool isn't flawless - occasionally suggests something totally off-base - but it's right enough of the time to save massive amounts of decision fatigue.

**My new rule:** If it's under $200, spend max 15 minutes researching. If it's over $200, max 1 hour. Done.

Freed up probably 6+ hours weekly that now go toward revenue-generating activities instead of optimizing the optimization of product comparisons.

I weighed myself before my gym session at 11am and was 89.4kg. All I'd eaten this morning was 2 slices of leftover pizza, and 2 cups of coffee. My weight was measured after I'd already consumed those.

Then I did a gym session consisting of various heavy weight exercises (heaviest being 100kg bench press), plus 4 gentle runs of about 400m each. My smart watch recorded a 39min43sec workout at an average heart rate of 127bpm (max 170bpm), supposedly burning 367kcal.

I drank about 500ml of water from my water bottle during the gym session. I was able to compare the weight of bottle I drank from, to an identical full bottle when I got home. Full bottle = 854g, used bottle =356g, meaning I took 498g of water on board during the session.

Yet when I got home and weighed myself again, the scale showed 90.8kg (same digital scale, same conditions, weighed 3 times at each weigh-in to verify the reading).

So what was going on inside my body that I gained 1.4kg after only taking on any 500g extra, and presumably sweating some off too?

I know you lose weight by breathing out carbon molecules. Can you gain weight by breathing in and absorbing water vapour?

Or is my scale just wildly inconsistent? (though I did try to control for that)",1,1757958450.0,AskBiology,1,1.0,False
1nhsqcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrCreepyPasta/comments/1nhsqcb/the_howl_in_the_pines/,The Howl in the Pines,"My old Ford pickup truck rattled along the uneven gravel road, and with every jolt, a shiver coursed through my body, setting my nerves on edge.

The fractured sunlight was filtered by the thick canopy of ancient pines, casting dappled patterns on the winding paths, while the forest faded in and out of light and shadow.

I found myself stranded in a small town named Blackwood, a name that felt like it belonged in a gothic novel.

My uncle Samuel resided here; he was my mother's reclusive brother, a man I had only seen during family funerals. He had sent me an unexpected invitation to spend some time with him following my recent... career setback.

""I've heard you've been going through some tough times, Ethan. Come and stay with me; your mother thought the peace might do you some good.""

My uncle's handwriting was spidery and precise, and calling it quiet was a significant understatement; this town felt like the edge of the world.

As I drove through the main part of Blackwood, it appeared to be little more than a collection of crumbling buildings and a dilapidated general store that seemed to have avoided a fresh coat of paint since the Great Depression.

As I passed by, I noticed a sign that read:

Welcome To Blackwood - Est. 1888. Naturally, there was no cell service, just the whispering trees and an overwhelming, oppressive silence.

I discovered that my uncle's house was a mile outside of town, tucked deep within the woods. As I navigated a long dirt driveway, I finally spotted the house.

It was a gaunt, two-story structure with a perpetually dark porch, resembling more of a horror movie set than a home.

I noticed my uncle Samuel standing on the front porch, waving at me.

His face was marked by years of sun and solitude, and his eyes seemed to harbor a bottomless well of secrets.

I parked the truck and let out a soft sigh before grabbing my bag, stepping out, and making my way to my uncle, who greeted me with a terse welcome and a firm handshake that felt like grasping a knot of old rope. He then offered to show me where I would be staying.

I trailed behind my uncle Samuel as he guided me through the house, sharing stories about the history of Blackwood and describing what the town was like.

Before long, we made our way upstairs, and he brought me to a room. When he opened the door, I peered inside, and my heart sank immediately.

Inside, there was just a bed, a drawer, a lamp for nighttime illumination, and a closet.

""My room is down the hall, and the bathroom is directly across from yours, so if you need to go during the night, you’ll know where to find it,"" Uncle Samuel explained.

He then mentioned that I could unpack my belongings and that he would be downstairs preparing dinner since I was likely hungry after my ten-hour drive.

I simply didn’t want to bring it up.

As I entered the room with my bag, I placed it on the floor and let out a soft sigh before starting to unpack everything I had prepared for this dreadful stay.

I took my phone out of my pocket and rolled my eyes; it felt like I was carrying a useless hunk of metal or plastic since there was no cell service available.

Just as I was about to hurl my phone across the room, I heard Uncle Samuel calling for me to come downstairs for dinner.

I tossed my phone onto the bed and made my way downstairs to the dining room, where I noticed a large pot sitting next to a basket full of biscuits, and my uncle was at the table, smiling.

Soon, I joined him, and in front of me was a steaming bowl of venison stew, which I learned was just deer meat—something I didn’t know people actually ate.

We both sat there, just eating. I didn't feel like talking at all; I didn't even want to be there. This was all my uncle's and mom's idea.

Then Uncle Samuel cleared his throat, which made me glance at him with a suspicious expression.

""You might not be aware, but animals have been acting strangely lately. For the past couple of weeks, Mr. Hemlock's sheep were killed, likely by wolves. We have them around here quite often,"" Uncle Samuel explained.

I remained silent about it, continuing to eat while trying to appear concerned, even though I wasn't particularly worried. The thought of wild wolves didn't intrigue me; I was from the city, after all, but what did I know?

A week passed in a blur of forced politeness and discomfort because Uncle Samuel is a man of few words. He often vanishes into the woods behind the house and returns late, smelling of earth and something else... wild and musky.

At night, the forest comes alive with sounds I can't identify—twigs snapping, the rustling of unseen creatures, and then the loud howling.

It was a deep, resonant sound that didn't resemble a coyote or a dog; it was too... powerful.

Whenever I brought it up, without even glancing up from his book or diverting his attention from whatever he was doing, my uncle would say, 

""That's just the wind, Ethan.""

One day, I decided to take a walk since it was the only thing to do, and I heard whispers around town. Not only had the livestock been killed, but Mrs. Gabriel's prize-winning dog went missing in the forest and all people knew was it went by the creek.

I was chatting with old Mr. Hemlock, the only resident I had managed to converse with, and I noticed his eyes were wide and filled with fear when I recounted what had happened.

""It wasn't wolves; it was too clean, too brutal, and the tracks near the body..."" Mr. Hemlock trailed off, shaking his head.

After my conversation with Mr. Hemlock, I felt compelled to head down to the creek, driven by a dark curiosity. I recalled the path Uncle Samuel had taken me on during our fishing trips.

Upon arrival, the creek appeared ordinary at first glance, but then I spotted it—Mrs. Gabriel's dog, or what was left of it. The area surrounding its remains looked disturbed, as if it had fought against something before its demise.

Before long, I stumbled upon the tracks Mr. Hemlock had mentioned. They were massive, far too large for any typical wolf or coyote I had encountered.

What was even more unsettling was that the tracks bore a resemblance to a human footprint, albeit mixed with distinct claw marks, sending chills down my spine.

When I recounted the events to Uncle Samuel, he became increasingly restless. He would pace the house at night, and I often heard him muttering to himself from his bedroom while I was in mine.

Eventually, he began leaving the house earlier in the evening, returning well past midnight. I noticed that his eyes seemed to glow faintly in the dim light whenever he came back.

One morning, I woke up, stretched, and made my way downstairs. The aroma of coffee filled the air, but there was no sign of Uncle Samuel.

As I entered the kitchen, I realized he was absent, but I found a note on the counter. It stated that Uncle Samuel had gone to the small store to pick up a few items.

I also noticed the morning newspaper lying on the counter and decided to check the news from Blackwood.

The headline reported that, following a series of mysterious animal deaths, the first human victim had emerged: Jedediah Miller, a well-known local trapper with a notorious temper and a penchant for whiskey, had vanished while hunting for deer the previous night.

Two days later, the entire town assembled in the square to discuss Jedediah. Armed with hunting rifles, I felt compelled to assist them.

This was despite Uncle Samuel's warnings to stay close to home, as the woods remained perilous.

However, I was determined to help the town search for that man, and on the third day of our search for Jedediah, we finally located him. A small group of us pushed through some bushes, and there he lay.

With every movement, his bones shifted with a sickening crack, his limbs elongated, and his hands morphed into claws. His face twisted grotesquely, the mouth evolving into a ravenous maw, while his eyes glowed with an unnatural intensity.

He gazed up at the sky, and the howl that erupted from his throat sent chills down my spine. Then came another sound, one of raw power and insatiable hunger, which chilled me to my very core.

Those were the howls I had been hearing each night, the very sounds Uncle Samuel had dismissed as mere coyotes. But it was clear now; he was a creature of the night, a werewolf and I sickly realized that Mr. Hemlock was right a werewolf had killed all of those animals and that innocent man.

I stumbled backward, tripping over a tree root, and a terrified noise escaped my lips. Before I could react, the werewolf form of my Uncle Samuel's alter ego froze in place.

It began to sniff the air, then suddenly turned its head in my direction; it had heard me.

Panic surged through me as I scrambled to my feet and fled in blind terror, crashing through the underbrush, branches clawing at my face.

But I could hear the werewolf, my Uncle Samuel, pursuing me, its heavy paws pounding the ground and its ragged snarls echoing behind me.

I kept running until my lungs felt like they were on fire, and my legs threatened to give out. I had to reach the house; that was my only hope.

I finally arrived at Uncle Samuel's house and burst through the door. I slammed it shut behind me, fumbled with the lock, and leaned against the door, breathing heavily as tears streamed down my face.

My Uncle Samuel was a monster; the man who had invited me to stay here in Blackwood was a killer.

A low growl resonated through the floorboards. He was outside. I could hear him pacing, his heavy breaths, and the occasional scratching of claws against the wood of the porch.

""Uncle Samuel, what have you done to Blackwood?!"" I shouted, my voice cracking with fear.

I heard his growl intensifying, then a low, deep, guttural voice rumbled from behind the door, stretched and distorted.

""What I've done, no Ethan, my boy, it is what must be done,"" Uncle Samuel said in that deep, guttural tone.

Suddenly, there was a violent crash against the door that made me jump back in terror; the wood was splintering as he tried to break in.

I scanned the room, desperately searching for a way out, but there was no escape, and all the windows were too small to climb through.

Another crash, and the door burst inward, ripped from its hinges. In the doorway stood the werewolf, with dark black fur, massive claws, and eyes glowing with a primal light. It wasn’t my Uncle Samuel; it was a nightmare.

The werewolf crawled towards me on all fours, moving slowly, its drooling mouth opening just wide enough for me to glimpse a row of razor-sharp teeth.

My heart raced in my chest, a frantic beat against my ribs. I seized a fire poker, the nearest object and my only means of defense, but my hands shook uncontrollably.

""Uncle Samuel, please,"" I begged him freaking out for my life.

The werewolf halted a few feet away from me. Its head tilted as if it were listening. Then, slowly and horrifyingly, the transformation began to reverse.

The dark fur vanished, the limbs shrank back, and the monstrous face contorted into the familiar, gaunt features of my uncle Samuel.

He collapsed to the ground, clad only in boxing shorts, panting heavily, sweat glistening on his pale skin.

""Ethan, I'm sorry, but I tried to prepare you,"" he gasped in a faint voice.

Uncle Samuel looked up at me, his eyes still holding a hint of that wild glow as they locked onto mine.

""Prepare me for what?"" I inquired, still gripping the fire poker as if it were a protective barrier.

Uncle Samuel pushed himself off the ground, leaning against the wall, panting heavily, blood smeared across his face and body.

""The curse, Ethan, is part of our bloodline, coursing through every male in our family. I inherited it from your grandfather, and now... it’s your turn,"" Uncle Samuel revealed.

""No - no, that’s absurd,"" I gasped, my heart racing.

""That’s the reason I brought you here. It’s why the attacks started. The beast… it craves sustenance. It needed to be awakened within you. I wasn’t merely killing out of hunger, Ethan. I was paving the way. Weakening the town. Making it simpler for you when the transformation arrives; it was time for the transfer. For you to assume the mantle,"" Uncle Samuel clarified.

Suddenly, he coughed, a wet, rattling noise, and then he expelled blood and black sludge onto the floor.

I stared at Uncle Samuel, my mind spinning. The attacks. The fear. Everything was a distorted rite of passage.

Then, an intense, blinding pain surged through my left arm. I screamed, dropping the lamp. My muscles convulsed, bones grinding against each other.

My skin felt taut, stretched, as if something was trying to break free from inside. A wave of heat engulfed me, followed by a bone-chilling cold that made my teeth chatter.

I gazed at Uncle Samuel, my thoughts swirling. The assaults. The fear. Everything felt like a distorted rite of passage.

Suddenly, a searing pain shot through my left arm. I screamed, letting the fire poker fall from my grip. My muscles convulsed, bones grinding against each other.

My skin felt taut, stretched, as if something was trying to break free from inside me. A wave of heat surged over me, followed by a chilling cold that made my teeth chatter.

I glanced down at my hand. It was transforming. My fingers grew longer, thickening, nails extending and hardening into dark, sharp claws. Coarse, dark hair began to sprout from the back of my hand, rapidly spreading up my arm.

Uncle Samuel merely observed me, a grim, knowing expression in his eyes, yet there was also a fleeting sense of relief.

""It's beginning; you'll feel it in your bones—the hunger. The power. Now you must embrace it, Ethan; you are no longer merely a man,"" Uncle Samuel murmured, a faint, almost satisfied smile gracing his lips.

Uncle Samuel grinned at me while I clutched my chest, feeling sweat trickle down my forehead, and goosebumps prickled my skin. The sensation coursing through me was unlike any pain I had ever experienced before.

Before long, the agony intensified, spreading throughout my whole body, tearing at me, and I shut my eyes, squeezing them shut tightly.

A deep, guttural growl erupted from my throat, a sound so alien to me.

Suddenly, my senses sharpened; I could detect the scent of pine trees and the moist earth flooding my nostrils with startling clarity.

The distant rustling of the trees and the calls of nocturnal creatures resonated like a roar, nearly causing my eardrums to burst.

My teeth began to throb and twist painfully as my new predatory fangs forced their way through my gums.

And then, all at once, the pain ceased. When I reopened my eyes, I scanned my surroundings and realized that the world looked sharper, with colors that were more vibrant than ever.

I turned my gaze to Uncle Samuel and for the first time, I perceived him not as a beaten old man, but as a fellow predator, finally free from his chains.

Next, I caught sight of my altered hands, with clawed fingers and the rough, dark black fur that was beginning to cover my body, and I felt a rush of excitement.

Let's just say that folks began to realize that twice as many animals were being slaughtered, and even more individuals who ventured into the woods at night after curfew were turning up just like Jedediah.

The howling was now even louder and more ferocious than before, and this time it was much closer to the town of Blackwood.

But now, it wasn’t my Uncle Samuel who was howling or taking lives anymore; it was me.

For the first time in my life, I found it hard to tell whether it was devastating or incredible that I could now pursue something different with my existence.",1,1757958369.0,MrCreepyPasta,0,1.0,False

My (30F) friend (34F), let’s call her Jenny, got married over the weekend. It was beautiful and minus this one hiccup, everything went flawlessly. 

The trouble was caused by Jenny and our other friend, “Hannah,” (30F). Hannah and Jenny have this track record of trying to set me up with guys and failing miserably. Despite knowing that I’m not super into men in the first place (I like them, but I generally prefer women) and despite knowing EXACTLY what my type is, they occasionally throw these men at me who do not fit into my type at all, and then they act indignant when I’m not interested. A hilarious example of this was about 2 and a half years ago, Jenny tried to set me up with a guy who was 13 years older than me. No shade to anyone who wants to date someone older, but age gaps that big aren’t my personal preference. She told me I was being ridiculous for letting a parameter like that stop me from even considering dating him because he was a really great guy. I told her that if he’s so great, she should date him instead… well, he’s who she got married to last weekend. So really, me being chronically single is good for everyone, including me XD She was right, he is actually a really great guy. I’m proud to call him my friend, and I couldn’t be happier for the two of them. 

Jenny and her man had a big wedding with a bunch of friends that I hadn’t met before, and I joked with her and Hannah a few times leading up to the day that I was gonna try to meet someone and maybe have myself a little fling. They were both super into this idea.

On the day, I was in the bridal party, so I was in full professional hair and makeup. We all looked really good, although obviously no one looked more beautiful than Jenny, who was absolutely radiant. Point is, I was looking good and I was highly visible. 

During the dinner, I looked around the 100+ guests and saw that there weren’t very many single people there. I saw a couple people who looked cute and who I’d maybe be interested in going up and talking to, but they all had dates. The bartender was kind of cute too, but she was very focused on her job and wasn’t interested in talking, so I left her alone. By the end of the dinner, I realized there was no one available who I was interested in. I kind of shrugged and thought, “oh well.” After all, the day wasn’t about me, and honestly I was just happy to be there and celebrate and dance the night away with my friends, a couple of whom were from out of town and I don’t get to see them often. 

That said, there were plenty of times throughout the evening where I was either dancing alone, or off taking a picture or something by myself. If someone wanted to come up and initiate something, there were tons of opportunities throughout the evening, and I’m always happy to meet new people. No one ever came up and said hi. 

By about 11PM, I was over the idea entirely. I was full of wine, happy for my friends, and ready to hit the after party and go to bed since we’d all been up since 6:30 that morning. 

Cut to the after party, I’m good and drinky, and Hannah demands to know why I’m not talking to any of the hot singles. I told her that there were none. She immediately whines and starts loudly pointing people out at the after party who I was NOT interested in. Frankly, even if there WAS a hot single there, I still probably wouldn’t have been interested in because by this point it was 12:30AM and I was getting drunk-cranky at the thought of having one more boring man pushed at me.

Well, guess what happened. Hannah’s boyfriend got his well-manucured hands on the situation and, after I specifically asked him multiple times to leave it the hell alone, he went and grabbed some boring man and pushed him at me. 

So now I’ve been up for 18 hours, I’m tired and barely sober enough to function, and now there’s some dude in front of me who I’ve never met, who hasn’t spoken to me all evening, and who, after about 5 mins, it became clear I was not immediately interested in. I’m sure he’s perfectly nice, but there was no way I was going to hook up with someone who hadn’t talked to me all evening until my guy friend grabbed him and shoved him at me, not when it was that damn late past my bedtime. If he really wanted to, he should have initiated the whole thing four hours ago, when I was full of pasta and coffee, not now when I’m full of wine and sass. The most annoying part was that Hannah, Hannah’s boyfriend, and Jenny immediately directed everyone away so they could leave us “alone.” 

I talked to him for maybe 20-30 mins. I didn’t find him particularly attractive, but obviously if he was really cool and interesting, that wouldn’t have mattered. He was NOT really cool or interesting. 

The whole convo, I kept saying stuff like, “ahhh, it’s been such a long and fun day, I can’t wait to go crash after this,” and “woooo I have had a LOT of wine, I’m gonna be a nightmare tomorrow,” before finally figuring out an escape to a different table. Hannah kept telling me, “You need to ask for his number,” and I kept telling her no. Less than half an hour later, it was time to head back to the hotel. I followed the bride and groom out of the venue and we walked toward the ride share pickup spot (I needed to ride with them because the groom had some stuff in my hotel room.) From behind me, I hear someone say, “Oh yeah, [Guy] go ride with them.” 

I turn around, and HE’S THERE. WHY WAS HE THERE.

It was at this point that I might be the ahole. I tried to keep my voice down but I was capital D Drunk at this point and tired out of my mind as I turned back to Jenny and just said, “No.” 

What followed was an absolutely ridiculous exchange that went roughly as follows:

“Jenny. No.”

“What?”

“Jenny, I want to go to bed.”

“No no, it’s fine.”

“Jenny! NO!”

“Are you sure?”

“Yes.”

“Are you SURE?”

“For the love of god, YES I’M SURE!”

And so on and so forth for the next few minutes while this poor dude probably heard the whole thing. I’m gonna be real, this guy probably thought I was a stuck up b*tch. From his perspective, I absolutely was. But I was just so tired and I really didn’t appreciate having another random man thrown at me after I’d explicitly asked my friends NOT to throw a random man at me. Not to mention that, if I’m gonna hook up with a random dude after one short conversation, that man had better be Oscar Damn Isaac which this man was distinctly not. I was frustrated, I was indignant, and I was DONE. 

Dude got the hint and wound up just going home in a separate car (he wasn’t even staying at the hotel) and I got several annoyed eye rolls from Hannah, a bunch of disappointed expressions from Hannah’s boyfriend, and some “ooohhhhkaaaaaayyyyy, your loss,” from Jenny. Yeah, woo, my loss, however will I go on knowing that I rejected Adam from Finance who I’d had one very forgettable conversation with? 

Anyway, I really tried to smooth my emotions down during this whole exchange, and everyone has been acting pretty normal since then, but I know that I probably came across as abrasive in that moment and I hate that I lost my temper even a little bit at Jenny’s wedding. The day after the wedding brought with it yet another passive aggressive speech from Hannah about how my standards are ridiculous and unfair and how I never give anyone a chance, blah blah blah.

Has anyone else had this problem? How do I tell my friends to knock it off and that who I choose to date or hook up with is my business and they need to stop trying to “set me up” with people because they clearly don’t have a good sense of who I’d be into? Done get me wrong, I want to meet new people, but honestly I kind of hate being flirted with in the first place, especially by guys. It so often rubs me the wrong way and it makes me feel like a piece of meat. (No, I am not secretly gay or aromantic, I’m just a contrarian and a feminist and I want a man to talk to me like he’s interested in me as a person which they never do whenever my friends pull a “[OP] thinks you’re cute you should go talk to her.”) The fact that I then get LECTURED by my friends for being “stuck up” whenever this happens just compounds my frustration.

Anyway, AITA for drunk-snapping at my friends because they refused to listen to me? And should I just pretend to be single by choice so that they stop pulling these stunts?",7,1757958257.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,1.0,False

Cannot get consistent pressure from the Apex. Using the same bean, grind and tamp, the pressure is never the same. The time to draw 36g from my 18g varies quite dramatically. I think I am dialed in and then will get a completely different result.

Milk steaming is also awful. First, the steaming wand does not always produce steam when turned on. I have to play with turning the machine on and off again to steam. Second, the steaming wand adds a good amount of water to my milk, In some cases I am ending up with almost as much water added as milk I started with.

When steaming, a great deal of water is discarded into the waste tray. Not a huge deal but I am constantly having to empty it.

Overall I was getting better shots, better milk and a more consistent outcome from my much less expensive machine. Contacted MiCoffee about it, but not much help there. May just charge this back on my credit card.

1nhsnsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1nhsnsc/evaluate_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_ninja_and_see/,Evaluate the Best Drip Coffee Maker Ninja and See If It Delivers,"Testing out the Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB coffee maker has been quite the experience in my kitchen. As someone who relies on a dependable caffeine fix to kickstart the day, I’ve put this programmable drip coffee machine through its paces as part of my routine. From brewing quick morning cups to hosting friends over brunch, it’s had the spotlight in different scenarios. While this model has some genuinely impressive features, there are also a few quirks I’ve noticed along the way.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the sleek black and stainless steel construction catches the eye. It feels well-crafted and sturdy, with the 9.96"" x 10.55"" x 14.61"" dimensions fitting snugly on my countertop without taking over valuable space. The 12-cup glass carafe included completes the look and, frankly, adds a professional touch to this household device. The buttons are straightforward, though the interface initially felt a bit old-school compared to some touch-driven devices I’ve used. Still, its simplicity means fewer things to break. The removable 60-ounce water reservoir is a godsend, making it ridiculously easy to refill without spills, and it feels durable enough to handle daily usage.  

**Positives**  
- Small-batch mode ensures I can brew just a few cups without compromising flavor.  
- Dual brew modes allow for both Classic and Rich options depending on my mood.  
- The removable water reservoir is incredibly convenient for cleaning and refilling.  

**Performance and Brewhouse Quality**  
This coffee maker shines when it comes to consistent brewing performance. The ""Hotter Brewing Technology"" it boasts isn’t just marketing fluff; it genuinely delivers piping-hot coffee with every batch. Neither too hot to scorch the coffee grounds nor lukewarm, the balance is ideal. I was particularly blown away by the brew strength options—whether I wanted something mild for an afternoon sip or a richer flavor to jolt me awake, both modes performed admirably. Having tested it with various coffee types, from standard supermarket grounds to specialty local roasts, the Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB handled them all. The machine churned out rich, aromatic cups that rivaled my favorite café.  

[Find the best price for Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b07ztyztj5/)

**Ease of Use**  
For someone who stumbles half-awake into the kitchen most mornings, the fully programmable 24-hour delay brew is a true lifesaver. There’s nothing like waking up to fresh coffee already brewed at just the right time. Small-batch mode is another handy addition, letting me brew as little as 1 to 4 cups without the bitterness or loss of flavor that some machines can struggle with using smaller batches. One hiccup, however, was deciphering the button combinations to program the brew time initially—it wasn’t crystal clear from the manual. But after a quick video tutorial search, I was back on track. In day-to-day use, though, it’s straightforward enough that even non-tech-savvy family members had no issues operating it.  

**Disadvantages**  
- The control panel could use a modern update; it feels dated for a 2020s appliance.  
- Programming the delay brew took some trial and error without looking up instructions.  

**Competing Products**  
In the coffee maker arena, the Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB goes head-to-head with models like the Keurig K-Duo and the Cuisinart DCC-3200. Given its price range, I noticed this Ninja has an edge in versatility with its dual brew modes—it manages both small batches exquisitely and larger pots without dilution or sacrificing flavor. In contrast, some competitors, like the Keurig K-Duo, focus more on convenience but lose points where depth of brew strength is concerned. That said, aesthetic enthusiasts might lean toward Cuisinart’s more contemporary design, though Ninja’s compact, clean design is easier to maintain over time.  

**Value for Money**  
If price alone tempts you, there are cheaper options for basic programmable coffee makers in the market. Yet, what stands out for this model is its ability to cater to both large households and coffee drinkers who prefer specialized settings without diving into high-end espresso-type machines. Some premium features like the small-batch mode and adjustable warming plate justify the slightly elevated cost, especially if you’re planning to keep it around for the long run. It functions almost like a premium brewer without the unnecessary bells and whistles unless you’re chasing a barista-level experience, which isn’t this machine’s lane.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Barndominiums have become a popular choice for those looking to combine rustic charm with modern comforts. With their unique architecture, you can create a stunning interior that seamlessly blends modern and farmhouse styles. Whether you are designing from scratch or remodeling an existing space, here are some inspiring ideas to help you achieve that perfect look.

### Open Floor Plans

One of the key features of barndominiums is the open floor plan. This layout not only maximizes space but also allows for a great flow throughout your home. You can easily connect your living room, dining area, and kitchen by using large spaces without walls. Consider the following:

- Utilize large windows to bring in natural light, making the area feel more spacious.
- Choose light-colored walls to enhance the feeling of openness.
- Incorporate strategic furnishings that create distinct zones without obstructing the view.

### Rustic Materials

To truly embrace the farmhouse style, use rustic materials while blending them with modern elements. Wood is a key player here, and you can play with various finishes to find your ideal combination. Think about:

- Exposed wooden beams on the ceiling for a cozy touch.
- Soft, distressed wood for your flooring to add warmth.
- sliding barn doors not only enhances the farmhouse feel but also saves space.

### Modern Accents

Pairing rustic features with modern accents can create a stunning visual contrast. Focus on contemporary design elements that complement your farmhouse style. For instance:

- Use sleek metallic fixtures, such as chrome or brass, for lighting and hardware.
- Include geometric patterns in your textiles, such as throw pillows or rugs, to add a fresh twist.
- Incorporate minimalist furniture pieces that offer both functionality and style.

### Warm Color Palettes

The color scheme plays a critical role in blending the two styles. Opt for warm and inviting hues reminiscent of farmhouse aesthetics, while also incorporating modern shades. Here are a few suggestions:

- Soft whites or off-whites create a clean and bright backdrop.
- Earthy tones, like terracotta or sage green, can evoke an outdoor feel.
- Accent walls in dark navy or charcoal can modernize the space while keeping it cozy.

### Cozy Textiles

To marry the comfort of farmhouse style with modern decor, textiles are essential. Layering fabrics adds depth and appeal. Consider using:

- Chunky knit blankets and throw pillows for warmth and comfort.
- Natural fibers like linen or cotton for curtains to maintain that airy feel.
- Vintage-inspired quilts that offer a pop of color without overpowering the decor.

### Functional Spaces

Another vital aspect of barndominium interior design is creating functional spaces that work for your lifestyle. Keep in mind these ideas:

- Design a mudroom to catch dirt and clutter at the entryway while enhancing the rustic vibe.
- Create a multi-purpose kitchen island that serves as both a cooking space and dining area.
- Incorporate flexible furniture, like a foldable dining table, that can adapt to gatherings or daily use.

### Artwork and Decor

Add a personal touch through artwork and decor. This is where you can really express your style. Here are some ideas:

- Mix vintage and modern art pieces to create an eclectic gallery wall.
- Utilize handmade crafts or local artwork to enhance community ties.
- Add plants or indoor gardens to not only beautify the space but also purify the air.

By mixing both the modern and farmhouse styles, you can create an inviting interior in your barndominium. With careful planning and thoughtful selections, you can achieve a beautiful home that is uniquely yours. Whether you are drawn to sleek minimalist designs or the warmth of rustic charm, blending these styles offers endless possibilities, allowing you to create the perfect retreat.

<div>### Embrace Open Spaces

One of the main attractions of a barndominium is its open floor plan. Embracing open spaces lets natural light flow throughout your home. This light can enhance the cozy atmosphere while making the space feel larger. Consider using lightly colored walls and wide windows to emphasize this openness. A large living area can combine comfortably with the kitchen, allowing for a seamless transition that is perfect for family gatherings and social events.

### Warmth Through Materials

The materials you choose play a crucial role in creating warmth. For a traditional farmhouse vibe, think about using reclaimed wood for beams, flooring, and accents. This not only adds character but also promotes sustainability. Metal accents, like steel beams or fixtures, can create a modern touch while keeping the rustic feel intact. Combining these materials will let you achieve a unique balance between modern and farmhouse styles, ensuring your barndominium stands out.

### Color Schemes for Coziness

Your choice of color palette is pivotal. Soft, neutral tones like beige, cream, or light gray can create a calming environment. Pair these with earthy colors like greens and browns to add warmth. Accents of deeper colors like navy blue or forest green can bring richness to the décor. Consider a feature wall to highlight certain areas, helping define spaces within your open-plan layout while still maintaining a cozy feel.

### Comfortable Furnishings

When selecting furniture, prioritize comfort. Large, plush sofas with plenty of pillows invite relaxation. Pieces made from natural fabrics like linen or cotton enhance the cozy vibe. Don’t hesitate to mix in vintage finds like a reclaimed wood coffee table or an antique side chair to give your space character. Always keep functionality in mind; multi-purpose furniture, such as an ottoman that doubles as storage, can make your space more efficient.

### Cozy Lighting Options

Lighting drastically impacts the ambiance of any space. Choose a blend of warm incandescent lights and softer fixtures like pendant lights, floor lamps, or wall sconces. Ensure dimmers are installed to adjust brightness according to the time of day or mood. Additionally, consider incorporating natural light sources like skylights or large windows to brighten your interior without overwhelming it with artificial light.

### Create Functional Zones

Even in an open space, establishing functional zones is necessary. Use rugs to distinguish the living area from the dining and kitchen sections. Different elevations, like a slight step down for the living area, can also create distinct spaces. By defining areas, you make the home feel cozy and organized while accommodating various activities, from cooking to entertaining.

### Incorporate Indoor Plants

Bringing the outdoors inside through indoor plants contributes to a cozy and inviting ambiance. Consider low-maintenance options like snake plants, pothos, or succulents that thrive in various lighting conditions. Plants not only enhance air quality but also add a splash of color and life to your barndominium. Hanging plants can add a unique touch and draw the eye upwards, enhancing that open-space feel.

### Thoughtful Décor Choices

Your choice of décor plays a key role in the overall feel of your barndominium. Artwork with local themes or photos of family memories can personalize your space. Use shelves to display collections or books. Consider layering textures with throw blankets and pillows to invite warmth and personal comfort. Mix modern and vintage elements to craft a design narrative that feels both curated and lived in.

### Practical Outdoor Considerations

Your outdoor space should complement your cozy interior. An inviting deck or porch can serve as an extension of your living area. Equip it with comfortable seating, outdoor lighting, and perhaps a fire pit for gathering. This connection between indoor and outdoor spaces enhances relaxation and offers more room for entertaining guests.

</div>### Conclusion

Creating the perfect barndominium interior involves embracing the unique charm of blending modern and farmhouse styles. This combination not only fosters a warm and inviting atmosphere but also ensures that space functionality is never compromised. By incorporating rustic elements like reclaimed wood, shiplap walls, and farmhouse sinks alongside sleek modern fixtures and open layouts, you can achieve a harmonious balance that suits both your aesthetic and practical needs.

When designing your barndominium, focus on key elements that enhance coziness and usability. Soft, neutral color palettes can create a calming backdrop, while strategic lighting, such as pendant lights and large windows, brings in natural warmth. Selecting comfortable furniture that complements your style can help transform large spaces into intimate retreats. Additionally, consider integrating multi-functional spaces that cater to your lifestyle, whether it’s a home office nook or a cozy reading corner.

As you dive into your barndominium project, let your personal style shine through. Whether you lean towards trendy modern pieces or classic farmhouse accents, don’t hesitate to mix and match. The beauty of a barndominium lies in its versatility, allowing you to craft a unique space that feels truly yours. Ultimately, the right interior design blend will not only reflect your personality but also provide a functional and serene environment where memories are made for years to come. Embrace the journey, and don’t forget to enjoy every moment of creating your dream barndominium.",1,1757958160.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

1nhsk2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ThrowRA829njsisj/comments/1nhsk2c/repost_of_my_stupid_first_post_because_its_gone/,Repost of my stupid first post because it’s gone.,"My gf(29F) and I (33M) have been fighting this entire vacation because my SIL’s made a bunch of really cool plans. Please help me understand how I’m messing this up.

Sorry for ranting and rambling, just frustrated. This was very cathartic to write though, really helped calm the soul. 


Every year, my parents take my siblings (brother 47M and brother 45M), SIL’s (47F and 45F) and I(33M)on a vacation. This year it was a beach house in The Keys. For the first time, I brought someone on the vacation with me, I brought my gf Maggie (29F). We’ve been dating a little more than 2 years and I love her. We’ve had a few arguments before over my SIL’s and mom making decisions for me, and me not being as financially independent as she wants. It’s been just occasionally, but she really dislikes that I don’t control my finances and we’ve fought a few times about it.


Background: this is probably important to mention because it adds context. As you can probably tell, I was a “oh shit, THAT can still happen‽!” baby (my mom was 44 years old.) My brothers both married their highschool sweethearts, so my SIL’s have been VERY involved in my life since I was baby. I was basically raised “hot potato” style, I had a bedroom at both my brother’s houses, and I loved it because it felt like I was having a sleepover every night. They were all busy with work, so I had an au pair that would be in contact with them and I’d go to whoever would be home earliest and that’s where I went for the night. But this and my parents being older and neither of my brothers having kids led to me being a little sheltered and spoiled. Which has led to the arguments with gf about them (mom, and SIL’s) making unilateral decisions for me, overstepping and me not being financially independent. Which I admit they do sometimes, but I think it’s because they care about me a lot and they usually make good decisions and they know a shit ton of stuff that I don’t. And they’re really intimidating when they’re mad and a lot smarter than me, and they’re all corporate lawyers who would never lose an argument to me, so I usually just go with things lol you would too if you met them. Like they told me I should be a teacher because I’m good with kids and would have summers off to golf (hyperfixation that never went away). I never would’ve thought of that but I do love it and it’s where I met my gf Maggie. 

So, this whole trip has been… stressful to say the least. We got to the beach house last, and all the bedrooms on the main level were taken, so we got a bedroom upstairs with a cool deck and a gorgeous view. Gf wasn’t happy about not getting a room choice. 

The second day, woke up and was talking to gf about what we wanted to that day while making coffee. My SIL told me, gf and I were going on a dinner cruise tonight, just the two of us. 

Even though she admitted she wanted to go, gf says that I shouldn’t let them plan my vacation days. But I wouldn’t have thought about going on a dinner cruise date because I’m not a 50yo woman, and i think it was obviously a gift for my gf anyways because she did really want to go, so what’s the problem? 

Then we went shopping and bought really over top beach leisure outfits and those stupid necklaces with your name it to wear one day because why not lol and she got mad after because I used a credit card. Went to the cruise, had fun, got mad because it was already paid for. 

The next day, wake up, are told boys (dad brothers and I) are flying to Jacksonville to play at my favorite golf course (fuck yes, it was so sick) and the girls are shopping and going to a fancy restaurant and then hanging out drinking margaritas. Again, gf likes the plans because she does want to get closer with my family, doesn’t like that I didn’t make them. 

So last night, I tell my SIL to text me the plans so it would look like i made them. I then texted them to the family this morning like I was running the show today, which she thought was funniest thing ever, and i worlds smartest man to think of this loophole. This was the wrong way to take initiative. I’m just so lost. Why does who makes the plans matter if they are good plans? I suck at planning things so why would anyone want me to be the one in charge of that? They are all old, I’m not going to be bossing around a bunch of old people. 

So I apologized for being a dick with the text and say we can do what ever she wants, so we hang out on the beach all day just reading and chilling. It was nice. 

But then, when we get back, my SIL’s had been drinking wine and they were planning to redecorate my condo in Minnesota(my SIL moved there when I was in college to be close to her parents, I would visit them in summer all the time growing up so I got a condo there as a graduation gift from her parents) because it was too bachelor pad’y not family cozy, no idea, but cool, don’t really care. Well, apparently I should care, I’m the one who’s supposed to decide which lamp, that I’ll never think about ever again after buying, is supposed to go in the guest room of a house I spend only a month at maybe in a year. And that I’m immature for letting them do it. I don’t even want a lamp. Who cares about a stupid lamp? Fuck the lamp. 

I just feel like I can’t do anything right and I’m frustrated because why does it matter if they plan things that everyone wants to do and do a whole bunch of stuff for me that I don’t want to do to begin with? Like if they want to do something and I don’t want to do something, doesn’t it just make the sense to have them do that thing? It’s not that I’m incapable of doing it, I’d just rather not. Like the example decorating my condo, I have such little interest in doing that, it’s insane. They like doing that. Doesn’t it just make sense to have them do the thing they want to do? Turn them down and declare independence; that doesn’t make any sense. Things are always good for us until money or my family comes up and I don’t know what I’m supposed do. I really want to make this work because I love her a lot, it’s just this week has been hell. 

(Also tomorrow, girls spa day, guys fishing. Another rad day, who would’ve thought. Carol 3for3, absolutely on fire this week!)

1nhsjgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundShape/comments/1nhsjgv/explore_best_wireless_earbuds_tozo_t12_pro_in/,Explore Best Wireless Earbuds TOZO T12 Pro in This Full Review,"Testing the TOZO T12 Pro earbuds for the past few weeks has been a fascinating experience. Right out of the box, they’re sleek, compact, and packed with features that initially piqued my curiosity. With modern black aesthetics and a subtle matte finish, these earbuds look premium without feeling overly flashy. I’m someone who is always on the move—whether commuting, working out, or just lounging—and these earbuds seemed designed to handle everything thrown their way. However, while there’s plenty to love about them, a couple of aspects warrant a closer look.

**Design and Comfort**  
The in-ear design of these wireless earbuds feels comfortable and lightweight, making them perfect for long listening sessions. Small and ergonomic, they came with multiple eartip sizes to ensure a snug fit. I had a good laugh watching my partner try on the smallest size accidentally, but hey, they fit me like a glove, even during intense runs at the park. Additionally, the IPX8 waterproof rating is no marketing fluff. I mean, who else accidentally drops earbuds in a puddle during a jog and just rinses them off? I did, and they emerged unscathed.

The charging case deserves a special mention. It’s got a built-in digital battery indicator, which is both futuristic-looking and handy. Beyond aesthetics, the case doubles as a power bank with its 2500mAh capacity. This feature saved me when my smartwatch died during a hike. It does add some bulk compared to other compact charging cases, though nothing unmanageable.

**Audio Quality and Performance**  
Let’s talk sound—the meat of any earbud review! These earbuds are powered by the Qualcomm QCC3040 chip, and honestly, it makes a difference. The aptX stereo sound is crisp and immersive. Whether I was indulging in bass-heavy EDM tracks during workouts or listening to a podcast about Icelandic crime dramas (yes, that’s a thing), the clarity and depth stood out. The soundstage isn't wide like an over-ear studio headset, but that’s hardly a knock for wireless earbuds at this price range. Plus, with 10mm dynamic drivers, bass packs enough punch without overwhelming the mids and highs. Audiophiles might nitpick, but for casual and on-the-go users like me, this delivers beautifully balanced performance.

**Battery Life and Charging Options**  
Battery life is such a standout feature. TOZO claims a total of 170 hours when paired with the charging case, and while I didn’t measure every second, I went days without worrying about finding a plug. Each earbud lasts about 12 hours per charge, which meant that even on a very long travel day involving four back-to-back meetings, these little buddies weren’t fazed. Pair that with the wireless charging on the case, and you’re looking at a convenience powerhouse. For people who are as forgetful as I am, not needing to keep track of random charging cables is a huge plus.

**[Grab TOZO T12 Pro at the best price on Amazon.](https://visionhut.com/p/b09g9qxztv/)**

**Noise Cancelling and Call Quality**  
These earbuds feature CVC 8.0 call noise reduction, and it shows. Calls sounded noticeably clearer with minimal background disturbance. My coworker—a chronic complainer about audio issues—actually complimented how I sounded during a Zoom meeting in a coffee shop. That said, these aren’t active noise-cancelling earbuds, so if you’re really looking to drown out airplane noises or construction work next door, you’ll feel those limitations. Personally, as someone who toggles between zoning out and needing environmental awareness during commutes, this level of isolation struck a great balance.

**Key Benefits**  
- The 2500mAh charging case doubles as a power bank for smart devices.  
- Comfortably snug fit with multiple eartip options.  
- Waterproofing (IPX8 rating) makes it worry-free for gym-goers.  
- Impressive battery life, reliable for extended trips.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Charging case feels a bit on the bulky side for some pockets.  
- Lacks true active noise cancellation for complete sound isolation.  
- Touch controls can occasionally misregister taps, which led to unintended skips in my music.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to competitors like Jabra Elite 75t or the Samsung Galaxy Buds+, the TOZO T12 Pro holds its own in terms of price and feature set. While the Jabra earbuds excel in more robust noise cancellation and tighter call clarity, their smaller battery life means frequent charging. Samsung’s offerings boast a slightly better app ecosystem, but they fall short in flexibility without their proprietary equipment. For a price that won’t burn a hole in your wallet, these TOZO earbuds shine as a fantastic all-rounder.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Are they worth the hype and price tag? Without a doubt. Their balance of features—robust sound, stellar battery life, waterproofing, and even a power bank function—positions these earbuds as a budget-friendly powerhouse. The few compromises pale in comparison to the sheer utility offered here. I’d readily recommend them to anyone seeking practical, versatile wireless earbuds without overpaying for unnecessary gimmicks.

1nhshb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1nhshb8/my_experience_so_far_with_vyvanse_and_the_good/,My experience so far with Vyvanse and the good it’s doing,"Some background: I’m a married dad. 46 years old. Software developer who works remote.

My whole live I have always had difficulty keeping on task or developing a routine. As a child it was terrible. I was held back 4 times, eventually dropped out of school.

Eventually found my way into tech and manage to scrape by a degree.

It’s been a really good journey. I prescribed Vyvanse two months ago. I’m at 40mg and it works wonderfully.

So, lemme start with my side effects, some good and some bad but none catastrophic.

Here’s a list:
- Profuse sweating during activities
- Dry Mouth / Thirsty
- Increase in libido
- Occasional Dizziness
- Sometimes have sleepless nights
- Significant change in mood. Towards positive. I always feel content or happy.

Now, that aside…  it has significantly improved my focus. At work I am crushing everything. My bosses have been impressed. I was already decent at what I did but I find I am far more diligent and I am much better at staying on task. 

At home, I get all the little “todos” done with no issue. I do not procrastinate any more. At all. I have an 11 month old daughter the meds have made time with her more enjoyable. Before my meds my brain was always negative about time spent. Now I am more “in the moment” her. My brain now sees it as boding and enjoys every minute with her.

I have enjoyed a smoother relationship with my wife. We always got along well, but I often missed things like trash or small todos she asks me to do. Now, I get it all done and fast! We also have more sex and I find myself thinking more about opportunities for us to bond, so we can keep connecting. (A baby can make that difficult) My meds gave me that extra focus… and dare I say… optimism?

Finally, I started putting all the code and money in place for a personal project I’ve been wanting to do for years but just kept procrastinating about it because… Because. I have made progress on it and I’m excited to work on it whenever I get a spare hour or two from the little one.

The quality of my life has significantly improved. I am grateful that my doctor heard me. It’s been wonderful.

As an aside: I avoid all other stimulants. I used to drink a lot of coffee and energy drinks. I stopped immediately. In my system, even a single coffee with my meds… amps me up so much… it’s crazy. I used to drink like 4-6 cups of coffee and have an energy drink before my meds… today zero. Just water and a protein shake in the morning with my pill.

1nhsetl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedByChery/comments/1nhsetl/explore_if_folex_carpet_spot_cleaner_actually/,Explore if Folex Carpet Spot Cleaner Actually Beats Set-In Stains,"The Folex FOLEX-1382381X2CLTH2 carpet spot remover has turned out to be a delightful addition to my household cleaning arsenal. I never imagined I’d get this excited about a cleaning product, but here we are. Over the past couple of weeks, I've been testing it rigorously on a variety of stains in my home. Between the two large bottles and the included microfiber cleaning cloths, this kit had everything I needed to tackle a mountain of stubborn messes. Whether it was wine spills, pet accidents, or mystery smudges that mysteriously appeared on my carpets, this product promised—and largely delivered—impressive results. Of course, there are a few quirks to keep in mind, which I'll get into.

**User-Friendly Design and Packaging**  
One of the first things I appreciated was how the Folex bundle is put together. The two 32-ounce spray bottles come with an ergonomic design that's surprisingly comfortable to hold even when your hands are covered in who-knows-what from battling carpet stains. The spray nozzle delivers a fine mist, which allows for easy application to targeted areas without soaking everything in sight. And let me not overlook the microfiber cloths—15x15 inches of absorbent, high-quality fabric that feel like they were designed to last. They’re perfect for blotting and scrubbing, and their size is just right—not too bulky but large enough to cover ground quickly.  

**Efficacy: Does It Really Remove Stains?**  
This is where the product shines. I tested it on everything from old coffee spills in the living room to bright red Kool-Aid stains my kids left in the playroom. To my amazement, the remover handled each mess with ease. All I had to do was spray, agitate with a microfiber cloth, and blot. It was like watching the stains vanish in real time. What impressed me even more was how it worked on pet stains; if you’re a pet owner, you know these can be particularly stubborn. I used it on my dog’s favorite ""oops"" spot and, not only was the stain gone, but there was no odor left behind.  

Stains removed with Folex didn’t reappear after cleaning either, as has occasionally been the case with other products. This feature alone has made my life so much easier. The versatility of the formula, which can be used on carpets, upholstery, and other colorfast materials, earned it extra points in my book.

**Safe and Odorless Formula**  
Safety is a major priority in my household since I’ve got kids who seem to touch and taste everything within a three-mile radius. The water-based formula, free of solvents or harsh chemicals, eased my mind while using it around the family. There’s no strong chemical smell, which means I didn’t have to ventilate rooms for hours after cleaning. The lack of odor might seem minor to some, but trust me, it’s a game-changer when you’re cleaning a high-traffic area that you need to use five minutes later.

[Check Folex FOLEX-1382381X2CLTH2 price on Amazon.](https://compare.senaar.com/p/b0byrcbqx4/)

**Strengths**  
• Excellent stain removal on a wide variety of materials  
• Easy-to-use spray with no rinse or vacuuming required  
• Comes with durable microfiber cloths for effective cleaning  
• Odorless and safe for families and pets  

**Limitations**  
• Can oversaturate if you spray too much, requiring more blotting  
• May not work on non-colorfast or delicate materials  
• Doesn’t include a replacement nozzle, so if it breaks, that’s a headache  

**Product Competitors**  
When compared to similar cleaning products like Resolve Carpet Cleaner or Woolite Instaclean, the Folex stands out for its simplicity and effectiveness. While Resolve and Woolite offer strong stain-fighting abilities, I found they often left behind a soapy residue or required additional steps like vacuuming after drying. Folex skips these tedious stages altogether. On the flip side, Resolve’s foam-based formula tends to linger longer in terms of fragrance, which some users might prefer if they’re not keen on Folex’s odorless approach. As for Woolite, it’s effective but doesn’t come bundled with any accessories like microfiber cloths, which gives Folex an edge.  

**Smart Spending**  
What makes Folex’s kit particularly appealing is its excellent ratio of quality to cost. The addition of the cleaning cloths adds tremendous value because they can be reused for multiple tasks, unlike disposable paper towels. And when you consider how much money this kit can save you in professional carpet cleaning services, it becomes even more attractive. Sure, it’s not the cheapest product on the market, but its effectiveness and convenience justify investing in it. Whether you need something for quick touch-ups or more intense stain emergencies, this is a solid pick.

There’s crying (sometimes yours), snacks launched across airport gates, and the constant existential dread of whether you packed enough wipes.

So when my cousin announced they were taking their 1-year-old on a *thierteen-hour flight*, I did what any rational person would do: panic-researched gifts. Not for the parents, for the *tiny chaos gremlin* they were bringing along. 

My mission: find things that might entertain, distract, or at least delay the meltdown until after takeoff.

Here are three of the most promising finds after scouring r/newparents:

1. [Tiny love’s DJ station](https://best-reviewers.com/dp-B0CWB6YVSD)  
This one is basically a toddler’s dream: flashing lights, sound effects, buttons to mash, it lets them feel like they’re in charge of the chaos (instead of just causing it). Everything about it screams “I will distract your child long enough for you to finish your airport coffee.” Small enough to throw in a carry-on, big enough to save a bit of your sanity.

2. [Tadpoles foam playmats](https://best-reviewers.com/dp-B01N9R8WZR)  
Not exactly portable, but they’re a lifesaver once you land. Great for hotel floors, Airbnb setups, or anywhere your toddler decides to attempt parkour. Bonus: they’re puzzle-style and have letters and numbers, so they double as sneaky educational toys. Triple bonus: they wipe clean in two seconds flat.

Missing my urge/drive.,"Most of my life, I have been very depressed and anxious and very impulsive -- and feeling this motor signaled to me that I was excited and not so depressed. Ever since I started treatment, this motor has greatly diminished, which has made me more stable and predictable and it feels soothing -- but something feels off. I've always relied on this motor as a way to complete tasks, and to do things. I've always been amazing at work and very fast because of this motor.

I am definitely more happy, and managed, and I can watch TV now and sit still and not as explosive -- but that motor is gone and it feels weird, like empty-ish. I've always drank like 10 coffees a day to induce the motor and get me through the day but then I would be completely burnt out, and depressed.

My logic has always been: motor = happiness, no motor = depressed. And now that the motor is gone, I guess I need to stop thinking that way. I essentially chased the hyperactivity and impulsivity at work and some other things in my daily life -- but was horrible for other things.

Also a lot of people keep saying ""are you sad?"", ""you look calmer"", ""you seem tired"". Because I guess I no longer have that urge.

I am not complaining, I am def better. but I am wondering if this is something other people have experienced with medication? Any tips? Will I essentially rewire the association I'm making (it makes me feel like I'm missing something).

1nhs7ey,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayTechTried/comments/1nhs7ey/spotlight_best_countertop_blender_performance/,Spotlight best countertop blender performance with Ninja CO401B,"Using the Ninja CO401B Foodi Power Blender on a daily basis has been quite the experience. As someone who loves kitchen gadgets but hates countertop clutter, I was intrigued by this all-in-one system. Ninja often gets a strong reputation for sleek, versatile designs, and this model didn’t disappoint in that regard.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about this blender is how sturdy it feels. With its glossy black finish and a slightly professional vibe, it doesn’t scream ""basic kitchen blender."" The controls are intuitive, labeled clearly, and simple to figure out, even if you’re only one coffee into your day. Its generous 72-ounce blending pitcher is ideal for making large batches of smoothies or soups, and it doesn’t feel cumbersome. However, its size might be a little overwhelming for small kitchens. I had to maneuver things around to make space. It’s worth mentioning the stainless-steel blade material, which seems built to last, even after battling frozen fruits and tough ingredients.

**Performance and Blending Power**  
The power and efficiency of this system genuinely impressed me. This isn’t one of those blenders that takes 10 minutes to crush ice – it pulverizes frozen ingredients in seconds! It even handled an experimental peanut-butter-nutmeg-datte smoothie day with ease (don’t ask; curiosity got the better of me). It operates at two speeds along with different settings tailored for smoothies, nut butters, and more. I particularly enjoyed testing its XL smoothie bowl feature; the results were consistently thick and creamy without over-processing. 

[Check Ninja CO401B price on Amazon.](https://triopd.com/p/b0bztllnf8/)

**Ease of Use and Cleanup**  
Thanks to a dishwasher-safe design, cleanup is minimally stressful. After clumsily spilling some leftover almond milk during testing, I was relieved that wiping the surface of the blender base was quick and straightforward. The auto shut-off feature also gives peace of mind, especially in chaotic mornings where multi-tasking is mandatory. While the components are easy to disassemble and reassemble, the blade can feel menacingly sharp, so a bit of extra caution is warranted when you’re cleaning by hand.

**Key Benefits**  
- Excellent blending power capable of tackling tough ingredients effortlessly.  
- Generous 72-ounce pitcher perfect for batch cooking, family-sized recipes, or meal prep.  
- Handy preset functions and speeds make it beginner-friendly.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Slightly bulky, making it less suitable for smaller kitchens or lightweight countertops.  
- Blade sharpness could lead to accidental nicks unless handled carefully during cleaning.  

**Slicing and Shredding Features**  
This blender doubles as a food processor, which is where it separates itself from your run-of-the-mill blender. I experimented with the reversible slicing and shredding disc to make coleslaw, and it sliced through cabbage and carrots like a dream. The grating disc worked decently with cheese but got a bit clogged with softer varieties, which was a minor annoyance. Not needing an extra processor bowl is a significant plus, though, and it minimizes storage struggles.

**Product Comparisons**  
While the Ninja CO401B Foodi Power Blender packs versatility, it faces competition from brands like Vitamix E310 or Breville’s Fresh & Furious blender. Vitamix blenders, although more expensive, tend to offer a slightly more powerful motor and longer warranties. However, they don’t typically come with the slicing and shredding accessories that make the Ninja a multi-purpose beast. Breville’s models have a quieter operation, but their blending ability doesn’t quite match the brute force exhibited by the Ninja.  

**Budget-Friendly Option**  
This blender brings excellent value across its operation, balancing performance with an affordable price point. Even though you’re not splurging on high-end models, it stands out for its versatility and efficiency. If blending multiple types of meals or snacks matters to you, this product sits at the perfect intersection of utility and cost.

1nhs6af,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nhs6af,Embrace the Ride - 2018 Scout Bobber,"There are motorcycles, and then there are legends. My 2018 Indian Scout Bobber firmly belongs in the latter category. More than just a machine, it's a statement, a testament to raw power, stripped-down aesthetics, and an undeniably thrilling ride that I've fallen in love with all over again.

A Nod to Heritage, A Leap into the Future

Indian Motorcycle's legacy stretches back over a century, a heritage rich with innovation and iconic designs. The Scout lineage itself dates back to 1920, and my Bobber takes that timeless spirit and infuses it with a modern, aggressive edge. The moment I first saw the 2018 Scout Bobber, I was hooked. Those blacked-out finishes, the chopped fenders, the knobby tires, and that aggressive riding position – it just screamed attitude. It's a bike that pays homage to its roots while confidently carving its own path, and I feel that connection every time I swing a leg over it.

Rider Reviews Don't Lie: My Year of Unanimous Praise

Even years after its initial release, my 2018 Indian Scout Bobber continues to impress not just me, but countless others. In the last year alone, I’ve seen so many riders, just like me, raving about its:

Effortless Power: That liquid-cooled, 100-horsepower V-twin engine? It delivers exhilarating acceleration and a smooth, responsive throttle that makes every twist of the wrist a pure joy. It's addictive.

Nimble Handling: Despite its muscular appearance, my Bobber is surprisingly agile. It’s a blast to navigate through city traffic and absolutely shines when I get to carve through winding backroads.

Unmistakable Style: From its aggressive stance to its premium finishes, my Bobber is a head-turner. I honestly can’t count how many compliments I’ve received, and there's a definite sense of pride I feel every time I park it.

Reliability: I've put my Bobber through its paces, and its consistent performance and robust build quality have given me immense confidence on every journey. It just keeps going.

From Coffee Runs to Cross-Country Adventures: My Ultimate Versatile Companion

One of the most remarkable aspects of my 2018 Scout Bobber is its incredible versatility. While its bobber styling might suggest a bike purely for short hops and urban cruising, I’ve personally experienced otherwise. I’m talking about racking up 10,000 miles this year alone, and we’re only 9 months in.  This bike isn't just capable of short sprints; it's absolutely built for the long haul. Its comfortable ergonomics (which, with a few tweaks, are great for extended periods) and reliable performance make it my ideal partner for epic journeys. It allows me to truly disconnect and experience the pure freedom of the open road.

Elevating My Comfort: The Memphis Shades Batwing

For those truly ambitious long trips, there's one accessory that has been an absolute game-changer for me: the Memphis Shades Batwing fairing. While my Bobber's minimalist design is part of its charm, the Batwing has transformed my riding experience for extended travel. Here's why it's been such a fantastic investment for me:

Superior Wind Protection: Long hours on the highway can be incredibly tiring due to constant wind buffeting. The Batwing significantly reduces that wind fatigue, making my long rides so much more comfortable and enjoyable.

Reduced Rider Fatigue: Less wind means less strain on my neck and shoulders, allowing me to ride further and feel much fresher at the end of the day.

Improved Aerodynamics: It smooths out the airflow around me, contributing to a more stable and pleasant ride, especially at those higher highway speeds.

Sleek Integration: I was initially worried about changing the look of my Bobber, but Memphis Shades designed their fairings to perfectly complement the bike's aesthetics. I haven't compromised on style at all while gaining comfort.

Whether I'm tearing up the city streets or embarking on a multi-state odyssey, my 2018 Indian Scout Bobber consistently delivers a great riding experience. It's a bike that doesn't just get me from A to B; it makes every single mile a great memory. So, if you already own one, embrace the ride!

*Mr Polanski, 42, told the BBC that Britain was ‘criminalising poverty and criminalising inequality’ and argued that some people steal because they have no other option.*

*He said he himself would consider shoplifting if he could not find a way to earn money or feed his family.*

*But Matthew Barber, the Conservative police and crime commissioner for the Thames Valley, dismissed the remarks as ‘complete nonsense,’ insisting shoplifting is theft.*

*Speaking at a meeting of the Thames Valley Police and Crime Panel, he said too many people already see shop theft as a victimless crime.*

*He warned that shop staff are often victims themselves and reminded the public that the law allows people to use reasonable force to prevent a crime from taking place.*

*Mr Barber said: “There is, sadly I think, a wider attitude out there from some members of the public who don’t see this as their problem. They see Tesco, Sainsbury’s and all the others as big corporate giants who can afford to take the loss.*

*“Some of them even use rhetoric suggesting that Tesco is the criminal for charging that much for a jar of coffee.*

*“I saw the leader of the Green Party in the press last week, saying we should have sympathy for people who steal from large stores because they can’t afford the goods. That is complete nonsense – it is theft.*

*“My point about having a robust society where we take responsibility does not mean, and I said this at the time, that people should put themselves in undue danger.”*

*The commissioner added that his comments were not meant to suggest that everyone should intervene in dangerous situations, but that the public’s attitude towards shoplifting needed to change.*

*He added: “I find the argument around this, when it relates to shoplifting, quite interesting — because so many people apparently see it as a victimless crime.”*

*It comes as Office for National Statistics data showed shoplifting reached a record last month of 530,643 offences reported to police in the year to March, a 20 per cent on the previous year’s total of 444,022.*

*That amounts to more than 10,000 thefts a week, or 1,454 a day the highest level since records began in 2003.*

1nhs3tg,https://www.twincities.com/2025/09/11/st-paul-city-council-cuts-vacant-building-fee-for-donut-trap-business/,Pioneer Press: St. Paul City Council cuts vacant building fee for Donut Trap business,"

For months, if not years, the shed-like, one-story building at 1350 Hague Ave. sat largely unattended at the edge of a Hamline Avenue service road, on a small spit of land that runs beneath Ayd Mill Road and the Hamline Avenue bridge. A house on the site was demolished in 2018.

Bradley Taylor, who lives within walking distance, figured the small black box of a building would be an affordable place to launch The Donut Trap, an homage to his favorite Los Angeles doughnut shop and his love of the arts. Backed by city STAR grant funding to fix up the heating, ventilation and air conditioning, Taylor opened his coffee, ice cream and doughnut counter this summer with the support of the Union Park District Council and others eager to see him succeed.

The Donut Trap’s exterior mural and hot pink front door have helped draw families from a nearby playground on the other side of the bridge. What hasn’t helped is a $5,000 bill from the city for purchasing a vacant building that is no longer vacant.

Surprised by an outstanding vacant building fee that has more than doubled his tax assessment, Taylor took his concerns to the Department of Safety and Inspections, and then to Ramsey County, and then to the city’s legislative hearing officer, and finally to the St. Paul City Council.

Disagreement, ambiguity

The strange, years-long saga of the Donut Trap’s vacant building fee came to a close on Wednesday when the city council agreed to meet the budding shop owner — the self-proclaimed “Black Martha Stewart” — halfway and voted 5-2 to cut his special assessment in half, even though it had already been added to his tax statement.

The unusual decision followed some disagreement and ambiguity over whether Taylor had been told by city inspections to ignore the fee while he was in the process of installing the Donut Trap with some $24,000 in STAR grant funding from the mayor’s office and the Ward 1 council office. The Taylors couldn’t be reached for comment Thursday.

At the very least, “DSI failed to ask Ms. Taylor and Mr. Taylor if they understood St. Paul’s vacant building program,” wrote Sarah Dvorak, president of the Union Park District Council, in a letter to the city last month, which was later backed by the Lexington-Hamline Community Council.

The vote also followed strong words from the city attorney’s office to Ward 1 Council Member Anika Bowie, who was advised in a two-page letter to recuse herself from the vote. She did not.

“This is not a problem property,” said Bowie on Wednesday, urging the council to cut a new business some slack. “This is not a property that is in the vacant building program. This is a building that operates as a doughnut shop. They are done with all of their (upkeep), as far as being up to code. The thing that complicates this is there was a change in ownership.”

The $5,000 vacant building fee, according to Taylor’s appeal to the council, was incurred by a previous owner and then added to his property taxes after he had filled the long-underutilized structure with a menu inspired by his own sweet tooth and love of pop culture.

Taylor has maintained that when he inquired with DSI about the vacant building notices, he was advised by city employees to ignore them, and that he had text messages proving as much. DSI officials have said no such conversations took place.

Vacant building fee

The building was enrolled in the city’s vacant building program in April 2019, a few years before Taylor acquired the property, according to the city’s Department of Safety and Inspections.

“We purchased the building in May 2023 and immediately filed for sewer permit, building permit, plumbing permit, gas permit, etc.,” wrote Taylor, in an email last May to Marcia Moermond, the city’s legislative hearing officer.

“Shortly afterward we began receiving letters regarding a vacant building fee,” he added. “We were very concerned since it was for a large dollar amount, so we reached out multiple times to DSI — via phone, text, and even in person — and were repeatedly told it was a mistake. We were advised not to worry about the letters and that no further action was needed on our part. At no point were we informed that we needed to formally appeal or take additional steps.”

“I even visited the DSI office in person for clarity, where I was again told the issue would be resolved and to ignore the notices,” he wrote.

Ashley Taylor, who co-owns the property, testified before Moermond this June: “We called every time we got a letter or notice. We received the same answer every time we contacted someone. Our confusion is we called multiple vacant building inspectors in 2023. What could we have done differently when we feel we were proactive … and (were) told it was a mistake?”

Taylor’s appeal won the support of the Union Park District Council, which assembled a timeline of events to share with the city council. Several neighborhood residents have expressed relief to see a derelict building find a new public-facing purpose.

‘Eat Donutz, Keep It Sexy’

The building’s exterior, previously painted industrial black, has been redecorated with a dynamic collage of splashy colors. Benches now line the patio. Taylor’s menu is no less bold, with inventive ice cream, coffee and doughnut flavors promising a quick sugar high.

Under the motto “Eat Donutz, Keep It Sexy,” the Donut Trap’s wide-ranging temptations include the Gay 90s (a vanilla glazed doughnut encrusted with Fruity Pebbles cereal), the Thotiana (a churro and tres leches-flavored doughnut) and a Coca-Cola Cold Brew (“Bubbly. Buzzed. A little wrong, but somehow so, so right.”).

Behind the scenes, the wrangles with City Hall have been less joyous.

On Dec. 3, 2023, the unpaid $5,000 vacant building fee — representing a year of vacancy — was forwarded to Ramsey County, to be added to the Donut Trap’s property tax notice. The building was released from the city’s vacant building program in March of 2024, at which time Taylor was sent a reminder of the fee, which was neither paid nor appealed at the time, according to the city.

During a public hearing last month on Taylor’s appeal, Bowie asked the council for a two-week layover, giving Taylor time to produce copies of the communications from DSI.

“I asked if they would please provide those text messages,” said legislative hearing officer Marcia Moermond, addressing the council on Wednesday. “Those text messages did not come forward.”

The vote

Council Member Nelsie Yang, who cast one of two votes against reducing or refunding the assessment, said she could not support a fee reduction without evidence. “The fact that we haven’t received anything is really disappointing,” Yang said.

Bowie this week was advised by the city attorney’s office that she had been seen conversing with the Taylors in the hallway outside the council chambers, which could be construed as stepping outside of her role as a neutral party in an appeals hearing. For appeals, council members serve quasi-judicial roles, and are expected to steer clear of dealings with either side.

Bowie denied that she held a hallway conversation, though she said her legislative aide talked with the Taylors. The county attorney’s office noted Bowie had written to the Union Park District Council, thanking them for their input, which could be construed as encouraging them to continue speaking out on behalf of the Taylors.

Bowie said she acted as a neutral party seeking more clarity on the situation. “If there’s evidence, I have to make a judgment call on that evidence,” said Bowie, in an interview. “Deciding to continue a hearing should not be reason to recuse myself.”

“The previous owner did not disclose that they had this assessment, and their title company did not disclose it,” she added. “(The Taylors) testified and said ‘we made calls and texts (to DSI).’ When I look at the record, I don’t see any evidence of that. I’m being neutral and saying, ‘well, show the evidence.'”

On Wednesday, after some discussion and disagreement, the city council voted 5-2 to support Moermond’s recommendation to cut the Donut Trap’s assessment by half. The relief will be structured as a refund, Moermond said, which is unusual for the city.

I at least think I'm an active listener = I ask follow up questions, I ask creative questions. I joke around. No dice. I can't force an energy match, I'm always the jester.   
  
I've gone on dates where I was bored to tears with men, and didn't feel like I could look up to them. A lot of them, they don't seem to have anything interesting going on in their lives. Dating them feels like babysitting and I feel tired socially after dates. I know I'm overextending, I am probably doing something wrong after an initial match on an app.

\
Alt text: Professional businessmen meeting, Bahrain company formation context.\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting Bahrain Bay and Seef District., FDI inflows rose by 12% year-on-year, topping $1.1 billion by Q2 2025. Reuters notes non-oil GDP growth holding steady at 5.7% (Reuters June 2025), driven by strong performance in financial services, logistics, and tech.\
With new regulatory reforms announced by the Economic Development Board (EDB), Bahrain now allows up to 99% foreign ownership in most sectors (99% foreign ownership in Bahrain), fast-tracking procedures for company formation, and further simplifying commercial registration (Commercial registration in Bahrain). This pro-business momentum makes due diligence more important than ever before.\
\
Importantly, the new Sijilat online system, introduced in January 2025, reduced commercial registration processing times from 15 business days to just 5. That’s a game-changer for M&A timelines.\
\
Why Meticulous Due Diligence Matters in Bahrain M&A\
Acquiring a company in Bahrain isn’t just about finding the right target; it’s about understanding the subtleties—legal, financial, operational, and cultural. Skipping even one step can unravel deals, lead to unexpected costs, or expose you to regulatory risk, especially in sensitive sectors monitored by the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB).\
Step-by-Step Due Diligence: Insider Strategies\
1. Corporate and Legal Structure Analysis\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration context.. Check:\
\
Memorandum and Articles of Association\
Valid commercial registration (CR)\
Current shareholding structure\
Powers of attorney and board resolutions\
\
Expert Tip:\
Certain Sijilat documents can be obtained directly by your Bahraini lawyer, saving you a trip to the MOICT office in the Seef District. I usually send a junior assistant at 7:45 am to beat the post-Ramadan queues—a time-saving hack many miss.\
Red Flags:\
Watch for incomplete filings or recent amendments; they could hide transfer risks or past disputes.\
\
Personal aside: Early in my Bahrain career, I missed a late-night amendment to a company’s Articles—costing my client three weeks of delays. Now, I always verify filings within 24 hours of deal closure.\
\
2. Financial and Tax Scrutiny\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs Bahrain company M&A., but VAT compliance remains vital. Partner with a local accounting firm well-versed in Bahrain VAT, Tamkeen funding audits, and payroll withholdings.\
Cost Parameters:\
* External financial due diligence can range from BHD 1,500 to BHD 8,000, depending on complexity.\
* Expect annual audit fees of BHD 600–3,000 for SME-sized companies.\
\
Detailed cost breakdown for Bahrain company formation here\
\
3. Regulatory and Licensing Status\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation Bahrain M&A..\
Confirm there are no pending inspections or non-compliance fines.\
2025 Regulatory Update:\
Bahrain’s Food Law Revision (implemented April 2025) introduced stricter traceability and recall requirements for F&B businesses. Acquire supporting records, including safety audits and recent regulatory correspondence.\
Common Mistake:\
Entrepreneurs overlook the requirement for a local sponsor/user for certain activities (still needed for a few restricted sectors). Local sponsorship guidelines are nuanced and easily misapplied. Double-check the Sijilat activity codes and ask for CR extracts.\
4. Ownership and Foreign Investment Considerations\
\
Alt text: Professional business support for foreign ownership in Bahrain. for most commercial activities, with 100% allowed for foreigners in designated activities.\
However,\
certain regulated sectors and some free zones have their own frameworks.\
\
Sijilat and EDB can provide preliminary eligibility checks.\
Free zone entities (see Bahrain Free Zones) offer tax holidays, 100% repatriation, and easier labor importation—but have mandatory office space requirements. Bahrain Logistics Zone in Hidd is a top option; office waiting lists are shortest mid-week.\
\
UAE/Saudi Comparison:\
Bahrain’s ownership freedoms and reduced minimum capital outlays often beat Dubai’s, especially for fintech or logistics.\
But, personal relationships (often built in majlis-style meetings) matter more here than in Dubai’s more transactional environment.\
5. Employee, Labor, and Social Insurance Review\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation HR and due diligence. records and GOSI (General Organization for Social Insurance) clearances.*\
\
Review labor contracts, visa statuses, and leave balances.\
Inspect recent visa change documentation—timing is crucial around Ramadan, when government processing can slow down.\
\
Actionable Shortcut:\
I once shaved five days off a closing by booking a slot on Sijilat for the labor clearance right at the start of the lunar month—when queues are lightest due to recent payroll cycles.\
Challenge Overcome:\
A client’s acquisition nearly stalled because a key manager was on an expiring visa. We expedited a replacement visa by activating a Tamkeen wage support letter (BHD 460 processing fee), allowing completion within 48 hours.\
Key Cost and Budgeting Considerations\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation and M&A., but deliver long-term savings through tax holidays and lower labor costs. Cost details breakdown\
Practical Insider Tips for Savvy Due Diligence\
\
\
Timing is Everything:\
Avoid submitting government applications or transfer requests just before or during Ramadan. Offices in the Diplomatic Area and Seef District close early, and queues triple the week before Eid.\
\
\
Location, Location, Location:\
For urgent CR or labor affairs, head straight to the Seef District branch office before 8:30 am—parking is plentiful, and the Sijilat counter serves coffee if you ask politely.\
\
\
Document Preparation:\
Pre-notarize any Power of Attorney at the Notary Public office in Bahrain Bay; their e-notary system (as of June 2025) allows same-day digital attestation. Print your MOICT e-stamps in advance to avoid high-demand shortages during major business events.\
\
\
Leverage Relationships:\
Majlis-style meetings—think traditional floor seating, strong qahwa, and informal introductions—often seal deals faster than formal tenders. Don’t underestimate the value of a quick WhatsApp follow-up from a new acquaintance you meet there.\
\
\
Unexpected Tangent:\
One time, a seemingly minor discussion about service charges in the Diplomatic Area led to discovering a dormant bank account in the target company’s name—unveiling a hidden asset that improved valuation and secured financing for the acquisition.\
\
\
Bahrain-Specific Business Culture Insights\
\
Majlis meetings may replace boardrooms; bring business cards and always accept coffee.\
During Ramadan, respect shorter working hours—plan meetings for early morning.\
Dress codes lean toward business smart, but light fabrics are necessary in the Gulf heat.\
\
Common Entrepreneurial Mistakes—and How to Avoid Them\
Failing to triple-check regulatory activity codes in Sijilat:\
Each code triggers specific licensing requirements and is not always intuitive. Print the full activity schedule before signing any deal.\
Overlooking ongoing government incentives through Tamkeen:\
These can reduce labor costs by up to 50% in the first two years—factor it into post-acquisition financial models.\
Assuming all free zones have identical benefits:\
Each (e.g., Bahrain International Investment Park vs. Bahrain Logistics Zone) has different office requirements and sector focus. Visit in person before signing.\
Advice on Reliable Resources and Service Providers\
\
The official Bahrain EDB portal offers the latest regulatory announcements and downloadable checklists.\
For sector-specific queries, I recommend Keylink’s Bahrain Company Formation Process guide—their step-by-step procedural map is clearer than the government’s own.\
For complex CR amendments or urgent labor clearances, Ali Alawi & Partners in Manama have consistently delivered results for my clients.\
\
FAQs: Bahrain Due Diligence and Acquisition\
\
Q1: Can foreign buyers acquire 100% of any Bahrain company?\
Most activities allow 99% ownership (details here), with full 100% for select sectors and free zones (see eligible sectors). Always verify current regulations on the official portal.\
\
Q2: What are the required documents for Bahrain company acquisition due diligence?\
Expect to request:\
* Valid CR and Sijilat extracts\
* Up-to-date Memorandum and Articles\
* Complete financials (audited if possible)\
* Staff visa, GOSI, and LMRA records\
* All sectoral licenses\
* Major customer/supplier contracts\
See a complete document checklist here.\
\
Q3: How can I save money during the M&A process?\
* Bundle legal, financial, and regulatory checks with one experienced provider.\
* Use official online services (Sijilat, e-Notary) to reduce courier and certification costs.\
* Apply for Tamkeen labor subsidies (details) to offset hiring costs post-acquisition.\
\
Q4: What post-acquisition compliance steps are required?\
* File changes in CR and Sijilat\
* Notify LMRA and GOSI of staff changes\
* Update tax and VAT records\
* Conduct annual accounting and audit (accounting resources)\
\
Q5: What’s the best approach for fast-track acquisition approvals?\
* Start document preparation during initial negotiations\
* Use early-morning office visits in Seef or Bahrain Bay\
* Build friendly relationships at MOICT and LMRA; quick messages can nudge applications\
* Consult a trusted local formation specialist (Keylink resource)\
\
\
Bahrain’s M&A landscape rewards those willing to balance technical exactitude with cultural understanding. Build a relationship, double-check every file, and never, ever underestimate the power of strong coffee in a Seef District majlis.\

**Why This Pick?**

The Texans have had a pretty mediocre stretch of games looking back to the tail end of last season. I’ll be honest, I still have that Christmas Day game burned into my memory (Houston lost at home 31-2 to the Ravens). The total line for tonight’s game (42.5) baffled me at first look, but I get it. The Texans’ offense has been looking bleak; outside of their win over the Chargers in the post-season, their only victories dating back to November 18th, 2024 came over teams like the Cowboys, Dolphins, and Titans. Meanwhile, Tampa has only lost 3 of their last 10 games, and all 3 losses were by a FG or less. I’m on the Buccaneers to cover on the road tonight, friends.

1nhrrac,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nhrrac/dibble_and_the_case_of_the_temporal_arbitrage/,Dibble and The Case of the Temporal Arbitrage,"The Keth'mori didn't understand theft.

Not because they were honest (oh, no). They'd been strip-mining neutron stars for raw matter before Earth had multicellular life. But theft implies scarcity, and when you live in the ergosphere of a black hole where one day equals a millennium in the outside universe, you've got all the time in the worlds.

Literally.

So when the Keth'mori Temporal Council reported that seventeen thousand years had been ""misplaced"" from their eternal accounts, the galaxy didn't just panic. It had an existential crisis.

The Zephyrian Cloud-Heralds (gaseous beings who'd appointed themselves as divine interpreters for the Keth'mori) began dispersing into prayer-fractals. The Galactic Banking Consortium's computers started dividing by zero. Even the normally unflappable Centaurian Trade Board issued a statement that was just three pages of question marks.

And into this temporal chaos shuffled Detective Arthur Dibble.

Human. Coffee-stained tie shaped like a small nebula. Coat that had seen better centuries. The only investigator in the Bureau who still used a wristwatch because ""time's supposed to tick, not quantum tunnel."" The Keth'mori called him ""the brief-lived carbon curiosity."" The Zephyrians just called him ""the dense one.""

But Dibble had solved the Case of the Backwards Bank Robbery (the thieves stole the money before they planned it). He'd cracked the Schrödinger Casino Heist (the chips were simultaneously stolen and not stolen until someone counted them). As the galaxy's temporal economists tried to calculate the value of stolen time, Dibble squinted at his notebook and muttered:

""Funny thing, though. You can't steal time. Time isn't a thing. It's a... what's the word... dimension? So how do you fence a dimension?""

The crime scene was Orbital Station Eternity, humanity's first diplomatic outpost in the Keth'mori Exclusion Zone. It drifted in the outer ergosphere of Sagittarius A-2, where time crawled like honey and thoughts stretched into centuries.

The station housed the strangest diplomatic corps in the galaxy:

Ambassador Chen Wei-Ming: A patient woman who'd volunteered for a posting where a single meeting could last subjective decades. She'd been negotiating the same trade agreement for three years ship-time, which was roughly 3,000 years local-time. The Keth'mori appreciated her commitment to proper deliberation.

Dr. Yask'tel the Dispersed: A Zephyrian Cloud-Herald whose constituent gases formed elaborate worship-patterns around the station. They spoke for the Keth'mori because the ancient beings communicated in temporal echoes that took millennia to propagate. Yask'tel translated eternity into mere centuries.

The Keth'mori themselves: Crystalline beings whose individual thoughts were geological epochs. They existed in orbital shells around the black hole, each ring deeper in time's embrace than the last. The eldest, those in the innermost orbits, were contemporaries of the universe's first stars.

They met Dibble with the enthusiasm typically reserved for geological surveys.

""Detective Dibble,"" Ambassador Chen said, her words stretched thin by time dilation, ""thank you for coming. Though I should warn you, the investigation may take... a while.""

""How long?""

Dr. Yask'tel's gases swirled into consultation-patterns. ""The Eternal Ones measure the theft in the Third Spiral's orbital period. Roughly... seventeen thousand years.""

""Right. And how long to investigate?""

""Well, if we're thorough...""

""Couple days should do it,"" Dibble said, checking his watch.

The silence that followed was the kind that archaeologists dig up.

The theft was elegant in its impossibility.

Someone had been selling “authentic Keth'mori temporal experiences” to wealthy collectors throughout the galaxy. Premium packages included The Contemplation of a Single Star’s Death (subjective experience: 50,000 years) and The Meditation on Quantum Foam Fluctuations (subjective experience: 800 million years).

The sales were legitimate. The Keth'mori had indeed authorized the transactions through their Zephyrian intermediaries. The temporal experiences were genuine, buyers really did live through millennia of crystalline alien consciousness.

But Dibble’s notebook carried darker entries.

On Titan, he’d once paused outside a clinic the shipping crews called the Clockhouse. The intake charts read like crime reports. Wealthy clients staggered out after “ten thousand years of perspective” or “a few lifetimes of peace,” staring through people like prophets burned hollow. The poor weren’t so lucky. They scraped together enough credits for a year or two of counterfeit eternity, ten years, if they sold everything.

Dibble remembered one patient, gaunt and trembling, who swore he’d lived a year where he was never hungry, never cold, never forgotten. He’d burned every credit he had for twelve months of comfort. Then he woke back on Titan, broke, shaking, begging for another ticket out.

He wrote in the margin:

“Keth'mori sells wisdom. Black markets sell anesthesia. The rich buy enlightenment. The poor buy a nap.”

That was the real rot. The crime wasn’t just temporal arbitrage. It was counterfeit eternity scaled to income brackets. The rich chased decades of fantasy paradise. The poor paid for a few borrowed hours of relief.

And when they came back, none of them came back whole.

The sales were legitimate. The Keth'mori had indeed authorized the transactions through their Zephyrian intermediaries. The temporal experiences were genuine, buyers (wealthy ones at least) really did live through millennia of crystalline alien consciousness.

The problem was the billing.

""See, here's the thing,"" Dibble told the assembled diplomats, sipping coffee that had been cooling for three centuries ship-time. ""The Keth'mori experience time different, yeah? One day for them, thousand years for us. But when they sell these experiences, what rate do they charge?""

Ambassador Chen consulted her notes. ""Standard galactic rate. One credit per subjective hour.""

""Right. So a fifty-thousand-year experience costs...""

Dr. Yask'tel's gases calculated. ""438,000,000 credits.""

""Big money. Now, when the Keth'mori authorized these sales, how long did that authorization take? In their time?""

""The Eternal Ones required... two contemplation periods to reach consensus.""

""Which is?""

""Approximately six hours, their subjective time.""

Dibble nodded. ""Six hours of their time. Which translates to...?""

The realization hit Chen first. ""Six thousand years, our time.""

""Six thousand years of authorization. For sales they thought were happening over six hours. But the buyers? They were living the experiences in real-time. Standard galactic time. Meaning someone was selling the same six hours of Keth'mori consciousness over and over again. To different customers. Simultaneously.""

The crime wasn't theft. It was temporal arbitrage.

The breakthrough came when Dibble stopped thinking like a cop and started thinking like a crook.

Which is to say: he got greedy.

""Who's handling the transactions?"" he asked Dr. Yask'tel.

The Zephyrian's gases swirled nervously. ""The Cloud-Heralds serve as intermediaries. We process the temporal translations and facilitate the consciousness transfers.""

""All of you?""

""Oh, no. Such sacred work requires... specialization. Herald Vorth'ak handles all temporal commerce.""

""Just the one Herald? For the entire galaxy?""

""Vorth'ak is... very dedicated.""

Dibble made a note. In his experience, when someone was ""very dedicated"" to handling large amounts of other people's money, they usually were.

He found Vorth'ak dispersed across seventeen sectors of local space, their constituent molecules arranged in what could charitably be called ""extreme guilt patterns."" The Herald's voice came through the translation matrix like a confession looking for a priest.

""Detective Dibble! Such an honor! Though I must say, your timing is rather... precipitous.""

""How's that?""

""Well, I was just... reorganizing. My molecular structure. For efficiency. Definitely not fleeing the jurisdiction.""

Dibble flipped through his notebook. ""Tell me about the Marauder's Gambit.""

Vorth'ak's gases froze. Literally. Ice crystals forming in hard vacuum. ""I'm sorry?""

“Human pirate ship. Registered out of the Outer Rim. Real piece of work, crew of temporal smugglers, black market chronometer dealers, that sort of thing. But here's the interesting bit: they've been making regular supply runs to your meditation sphere. Bringing you something. Want to guess what?”

""I... couldn't possibly...""

""Temporal compression units. Military grade. The kind that let you experience years of subjective time in minutes of objective time. Perfect for, say, taking a six-hour Keth'mori consciousness experience and stretching it across thousands of simultaneous customers.""

The Herald's molecular structure began dispersing. Classic Zephyrian panic response.

""Now here's what I think happened,"" Dibble continued. ""Captain Sarah 'Timeloop' McGrath and her crew approached you with a business proposition. The Keth'mori sell these temporal experiences at honest rates, one consciousness, one customer, fair trade. But what if you could... optimize the process?""

""You don't understand!"" Vorth'ak's gases swirled into desperate confession-patterns. ""The Eternal Ones think in geological time! When they authorized the sales, they meant for each experience to be sold once, to one customer. But their authorization takes thousands of years to propagate through normal time! During that propagation period, technically, the same authorization exists in multiple temporal states!""

""So you sold the same experience to multiple customers simultaneously.""

""It wasn't theft! It was... temporal efficiency! The customers got exactly what they paid for, genuine Keth'mori consciousness experiences. The Keth'mori received fair payment for their time. Everyone was happy!""

""Except for the part where you and the pirates pocketed about a trillion credits in illegal temporal arbitrage.""

Vorth'ak's silence was the kind that lawyers charge extra for.

The beautiful part, the part that made Dibble respect the scheme even as he busted it, was that it actually worked.

The customers really did experience millennia of alien consciousness. The Keth'mori really did receive payment for their time. The crime existed entirely in the gap between authorization and execution, in the temporal lag between intention and reality.

It was the perfect crime. Undetectable to beings who thought in epochs. Invisible to entities who experienced time as a spreadsheet of quantum events.

Only humans were impatient enough to notice that the same experience was being sold thousands of times during what the Keth'mori considered a single moment.

Only humans were suspicious enough to wonder why one Herald was handling all the galaxy's temporal commerce.

Only humans were criminal enough to invent temporal arbitrage in the first place.

""You want to know the really beautiful part?"" Dibble told Ambassador Chen as Vorth'ak was led away in ionic containment. ""McGrath and her crew didn't steal time. They stole the gap between times. The pause between one moment and the next. They monetized latency.""

""How very human,"" Chen observed.

""Yeah. We're good at finding the angles nobody else thought to look for.""

The Keth'mori Temporal Council deliberated for six months (roughly 6,000 years local time) before issuing their judgment. The stolen time would be returned to the galactic temporal commons. Vorth'ak would spend the next seventeen thousand years in contemplative confinement. The pirates of the Marauder's Gambit would be sentenced to ""subjective time equivalent to their crimes"", meaning they'd experience their prison sentences at Keth'mori temporal rates.

Captain McGrath, facing 50,000 years of subjective prison time compressed into six months of objective time, was reported to have said: ""Worth it.""

But Dibble kept his notebook.

His final entry read:

""Time isn't money. Time is time. But humans will find a way to sell anything, including the spaces between seconds. Good thing someone's keeping track in analog.""

As he caught the transport back to normal spacetime, Dibble reflected on the case. The Keth'mori would never understand urgency. The Zephyrians would never comprehend greed. Both species thought in terms of cosmic time, eternal purpose, infinite contemplation.

Only humans were clever enough to find profit in the pause.

Only humans were crooked enough to steal the gap between heartbeats.

Only humans were fast enough to commit crimes in the spaces between alien thoughts.

And somewhere in the ergosphere of a black hole, where time moves like crystallized thought and moments last millennia, the Keth'mori continued their eternal meditations. Wiser now. More careful about the spaces between their words.

Because Detective Arthur Dibble had taught them the human lesson:

Even eternity has loopholes.

""Oh, just one more thing...""

What if the universe's biggest vulnerability isn't entropy or heat death or cosmic expansion?

What if it's the assumption that everyone plays by the same rules of time?

What if some species are just... faster at being crooked?

[Selo's ](http://ko-fi.com/selo)Note: In memory of all the humans who stared into infinity and asked, “Yeah, but what’s the markup?” 

Because the deepest crimes aren’t against space, matter, or energy. They’re against time itself. And those are the ones we excel at.

What's the best course of action?","So I went on a first date with a woman about a week ago and it went very well. We got coffee and sat around in town talking for almost 5 hours. We definitely had a lot in common, she definitely seems interested in me, both of us expressed interest in going out again. Nothing physical really happened, we hugged at the end but no kiss. Since then we've been texting pretty frequently, almost daily, we definitely have a connection but it kinda feels more platonic than romantic. I still would like to go on the second date so I can get a better sense of the connection and how I feel. Something to note though is that for both dates she'd be driving in to my area from a bit of a long way, like 45 mins - 1 hour drive. Despite my offers to come out to her or meet halfway, she very much insists that she doesn't mind though because there is very little to do in her area and all the nice fun stuff is in my area.

With all that in mind I am a little unsure on how to proceed. As much as I would like to go on the second date so that I can get a better idea of the connection and how I feel, I would feel bad for her to drive so far out only to possibly get turned down by me in the end. I don't know if I should just pull the plug before the second date. Or to do the second date, and if I'm sure by the end I'm not really feeling it should I tell her in person (can't imagine she'd feel great driving that long way back home after just getting turned down) or tell her a little later via text/call (worried about her feeling like she wasted a lot of time and gas for 2 dates just to get turned down in the end).

I would say for the past three months I’ve been unmotivated and have been doing just enough work to be an asset to my team.

Dad was sitting at the table, eyes glued to the newspaper.

Mom hummed her song off key while pouring coffee.  

My slippers were on the left side of the bed, where they've been since the last decade.

The fridge clock stuck at 9:17 for exactly sixty seconds before ticking forward again.  



Everyday cycle. Regular, boring, unchanged.  



This morning, I woke up, or at least I think I did, and nothing was the same.



The slippers were on the right side. Not close, but perfectly aligned, as if carefully placed.  

The fridge clock wasn’t analog anymore. A square LED one blinked in steady pulses, like a heartbeat.  

The toothbrush in the cup was red, rather than blue. I could swear I’d used that blue one for years, or had I?



Small changes. Easy to dismiss. But when you know every corner of your life, you notice when it bends.  



I whispered to myself, “It’s fine. I’m just tired.”  



Then Dad walked in.  



His beard was gray and heavy, thick as a brush. His hair was longer, falling on his forehead. He looked like a man who had been unkempt for weeks.  



I asked him how he grew such a beard in one day or if it was fake. He just smiled in a way that didn’t reflect in his eyes. 



“It’ll all make sense soon, just trust us.”  He said.



“What is that supposed to mean?” I asked. He ignored me as if the sentence had never reached his ears. 



My insides turned.  



The house was full of cracks that could no longer be ignored, 



The cereal box in the cupboard was already half empty, I clearly remembered buying it the day before. Who ate it? When?  

The TV anchors smiled with familiar faces, but their mouths didn’t match the words. Their voices echoed half a second too late.  

Family photos looked off, same clothes, same living room, but my smile didn’t reach my eyes. I looked distant.  

The whole experience? Uncanny.

I had an obvious expression on my face, one that showed I knew everything wasn’t normal.  



My parents noticed.  



“Sit down,” Mom said. “Don’t strain yourself.”  

“You’re just confused,” Dad said shortly after. His voice was too soft, like he was reading a rehearsed line. 



When I tried to leave, they blocked the door. Mom’s hand brushed mine, ice cold. Dad’s eyes were red, tired, but he didn’t say a word.  



I shoved past them and ran outside. They didnt follow.



I tried calling emergency services. Instead of a dispatcher, a cheerful hold jingle played. But the jingle warped, first slowing down, then speeding up, like a cassette tape melting in heat. No voice ever came on the line.  



I hung up, heart pounding.  



The street was filled with taxis idling in silence. Every cabbie wore mirrored sunglasses. Heads turned in unison as I sprinted past. One stepped out and reached for me with perfectly predicted timing.  



I struggled and fought free, stumbling forward, and spotted a cop at the corner.  



“Help! I need help! The people, my parents, everything-” I shouted.  



She turned slowly, her eyes calm and unblinking. “I know,” she said. “I’ve seen this before.”  



When I blinked my eyes, I woke up in a hospital bed. A doctor removed some sort of equipment, almost like a helmet, from my head. Machines buzzed around me. My parents sat on either side, gripping my hands too tight.  



“You fainted,” Dad said gently.  

“You’re very sick,” Mom whispered. “But this is for your treatment.”  



A man in a lab coat stepped into the room. He didn’t introduce himself. His voice was flat, and without a speck of emotion.  

“You are part of a controlled experiment,” he said. “Your memory resets at the end of each cycle. You retain fragments from before, but nothing more. Each day is reconstructed with changes: subtle shifts in the environment, behavioral changes in family, technology adjustments. The goal is simple, to find out how long it takes before you place complete, unquestioning trust in the procedure. Let what is happening happen, go through with it. That is all we ask of you.”  



I stared at him. “And if I fail to?"" 



“Then we reset the cycle again,” he said. “Until you do.”  



On the monitor beside me, a batch number blinked steadily, reading B3L13V3.  



Mom squeezed my hand harder. Dad kept his eyes down, trying to hold back his emotions.



I’ve tried leaving signs.



A smudge on the bathroom mirror.  

An X carved into a coin in my pocket.  

A scar on the tissue at the base of my thumb.

Every reset blurs them, fades them. Sometimes changes them completely. But some traces survive. That’s how I know it isnt all in my mind.



The cereal box dates. The beard growth. The length of shadows outside the window. I thought only one day had passed. Fourteen days have gone. Maybe more.  



They keep putting me back at the start.  



I don’t think the machine only affects memory. I believe it warps reality itself.  



Sometimes the resets feel too perfect. Objects placed with inhuman precision, conversations delivered like scripted lines. Other times, it glitches: jingle loops, smiles out of sync, my own handwriting appearing where I don’t remember leaving it.  



What if the real world is just another layer? What if I’ve never actually left the machine?  



I don’t know how many times this has happened.  

I don’t know how much of me survives between loops.  

I don’t even know if writing this will survive.  



But I can feel it from the looks in their eyes, they’re about to plug me in again.  



Tomorrow I’ll wake up. My slippers will be in the wrong place. The fridge will hum differently. Mom will hum her song out of key. Dad will say to trust them. Yet, somehow about all of it will be different, something I can not place my finger on.



And I’ll know it’s all wrong. I always do. But no matter how many times I fight, no matter how many marks I leave, they’ll reset me.  



They won’t stop until I break.  

They won’t stop until I submit. 



And maybe that is why i never will.

I struggled and fought free, stumbling forward, and spotted a cop at the corner.  



“Help! I need help! The people, my parents, everything-” I shouted.  



She turned slowly, her eyes calm and unblinking. “I know,” she said. “I’ve seen this before.”  



When I blinked my eyes, I woke up in a hospital bed. A doctor removed some sort of equipment, almost like a helmet, from my head. Machines buzzed around me. My parents sat on either side, gripping my hands too tight.  



“You fainted,” Dad said gently.  

“You’re very sick,” Mom whispered. “But this is for your treatment.”  



A man in a lab coat stepped into the room. He didn’t introduce himself. His voice was flat, and without a speck of emotion.  

“You are part of a controlled experiment,” he said. “Your memory resets at the end of each cycle. You retain fragments from before, but nothing more. Each day is reconstructed with changes: subtle shifts in the environment, behavioral changes in family, technology adjustments. The goal is simple, to find out how long it takes before you place complete, unquestioning trust in the procedure. Let what is happening happen, go through with it. That is all we ask of you.”  



I stared at him. “And if I fail to?"" 



“Then we reset the cycle again,” he said. “Until you do.”  



On the monitor beside me, a batch number blinked steadily, reading B3L13V3.  



Mom squeezed my hand harder. Dad kept his eyes down, trying to hold back his emotions.



I’ve tried leaving signs.



A smudge on the bathroom mirror.  

An X carved into a coin in my pocket.  

A scar on the tissue at the base of my thumb.

Every reset blurs them, fades them. Sometimes changes them completely. But some traces survive. That’s how I know it isnt all in my mind.



The cereal box dates. The beard growth. The length of shadows outside the window. I thought only one day had passed. Fourteen days have gone. Maybe more.  



They keep putting me back at the start.  



I don’t think the machine only affects memory. I believe it warps reality itself.  



Sometimes the resets feel too perfect. Objects placed with inhuman precision, conversations delivered like scripted lines. Other times, it glitches: jingle loops, smiles out of sync, my own handwriting appearing where I don’t remember leaving it.  



What if the real world is just another layer? What if I’ve never actually left the machine?  



I don’t know how many times this has happened.  

I don’t know how much of me survives between loops.  

I don’t even know if writing this will survive.  



But I can feel it from the looks in their eyes, they’re about to plug me in again.  



Tomorrow I’ll wake up. My slippers will be in the wrong place. The fridge will hum differently. Mom will hum her song out of key. Dad will say to trust them. Yet, somehow about all of it will be different, something I can not place my finger on.



And I’ll know it’s all wrong. I always do. But no matter how many times I fight, no matter how many marks I leave, they’ll reset me.  



They won’t stop until I break.  

They won’t stop until I submit. 



And maybe that is why i never will.

**Quality indicators**: Always include terms like ""professional photography,"" ""high resolution,"" ""commercial quality,"" or ""shot on \[specific camera\]"" to enhance realism.

**Lighting is everything**: Specify exact lighting conditions, sources, and mood to achieve photorealistic results.

These prompts serve as templates - modify subjects, settings, and details to match your specific vision while maintaining the technical photography elements for consistently photorealistic results.",1,1757955647.0,digitaliconix,0,1.0,False

The effect is a full body encompassing tension/stress relief from head to toe giving the feeling of being on a cloud. With the African Landrace lineage, there is also an insane psychedelic trippy effect to where it literally feels like you are on a different planet. Visuals and colors become extremely vibrant and glowing. Dreamy and psychedelic is a good way to put it.

BF invited female coworker over without talking to me first,"My boyfriend (both of us are 43) invited a female coworker over to our shared home. I want to preface this by saying they originally met on a dating site, but it didn’t go far and they’ve remained friends. She also has a boyfriend.
The reason for her visit was to pick up a coffee pot I was planning to donate. However, my boyfriend didn’t mention this plan to me until about 15 minutes before she arrived. They work in the same warehouse, and she now lives in his old house on the warehouse property. They both have keys to that house and can come and go freely.
I expressed my feelings and confusion—mainly, why couldn’t he just bring the coffee pot to work the next day? That conversation didn’t go anywhere, and I was already in the middle of making dinner when she showed up. I stayed polite and hospitable while she was there.
Then, unexpectedly, he asked her to stay for dinner. I hadn’t planned for a third person, so I scrambled to make it work. At that point, I was upset and started to emotionally withdraw, avoiding and ignoring him while I finished cooking. That upset him, and he retreated to the bedroom, refusing to come out or eat.
I was left to manage the situation alone. I decided to send her home with food but didn’t join her for dinner—and neither did he. After she left, we had a heated argument.
Now, as I write this, I’m still second-guessing myself. Am I overreacting? Was I out of line? I’m running on very little sleep, and everything still feels raw.",7,1757955576.0,AmIOverreacting,13,1.0,False

My main concern is VOC's released by the tpu faux leather which can be quite harmful in the long run

I asked how to get rid of the smell chatgpt and it recommended putting the ear pads in coffee+carbonate. After leaving them in the mixture for about 3 days there wasn't much of an improvement that couldn't be explained by coffee masking the smell. Then I tried wiping it with diluted rubbing alcohol a couple of times, the smell was gone right after but came back later each time.

Any recommendations would be appreciated. I'm just sad that I wasn't able to use my new headphones that I've been saving for.

1nhrdjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1nhrdjy/question_about_withdrawal/,Question about withdrawal....,"I've been on about 200mg of caffeine for a long time now. One cup of black coffee (11g of beans, so we aren't talking about a huge 32oz ""cup"") in the morning and then 1-2 espressos mid-morning. 40 years old. Always been super sensitive to caffeine which is why I didn't drink more than 200mg or so.

In an effort to optimize my sleep, I kept pushing back my last caffeine hit. First 2pm about a year ago. Then 12pm about 6 months ago. Then 10am about 1 month ago. then I cut out the cup of coffee and went to one 50mg espresso shot at 7am for a few weeks. Last week I have only had 1 decaf espresso shot.

Anyway here's my question: I know it hasn't been long, but I haven't really had any withdrawal symptoms. Couple small headaches. I read tons of horror stories about withdrawal, with only a few ""lucky"" ones sprinkled in that didn't seem to experience much.

Is it possible there's a huge correlation with the intensity of withdrawal and how locked in the rest of your life/health is? I.e., can caffeine kind of mask everything an unhealthy person might otherwise feel, and this is part of the symptoms? Perhaps it's just that 200mg isn't/wasn't that much.

I've always been pretty healthy but made a concerted effort a year ago to max out. My RHR is 47. HRV is high. Body fat 10-15%. I swim, run, lift weights. I've also noticed a few other posts from people that didn't experience many symptoms, and they tend to throw in something that shows they are otherwise a bit more healthy than average.

1nhrbo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1nhrbo8/should_you_buy_the_best_electric_kettle_zwilling/,Should You Buy the Best Electric Kettle ZWILLING Enfinigy,"The ZWILLING 53103-200 Enfinigy Glass Kettle quickly became an integral part of my morning routine, and it’s safe to say this isn’t your average electric kettle. As someone who loves tea, coffee, and everything in between, I found this kettle was designed with enthusiasts like me in mind. Its chic brushed silver finish and borosilicate glass build make it an elegant and durable countertop addition, but there’s more to it than good looks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek aesthetic of this kettle had me smitten from the start. The brushed silver finish paired with the borosilicate glass body gives a minimalist yet sophisticated vibe. Its transparency lets you monitor the water level easily with the double-sided measuring line—a small but highly convenient feature. The materials feel premium, and the glass construction adds to its durability, resisting thermal breakage like a champ. That said, the 1.7-liter capacity delivers on utility, easily allowing me to prepare tea or coffee for a group of friends.

**Temperature Control Perfection**  
With six pre-set temperature options, it takes the guesswork out of heating water for green tea, black tea, or even French press coffee. I loved how precise the temperature control was—it made a noticeable difference in the flavor profiles of my teas. The kettle also includes a tea timer, adjustable up to 10 minutes. It’s an excellent touch for brewing loose-leaf tea to perfection. I experimented with the timer and was impressed, though there were moments I wished for an alert louder than its subtle beep.

[Check ZWILLING 53103-200 price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b099gpcfmw/)

**Convenience and Special Features**  
What sets this kettle apart from others I’ve used is the stainless-steel tea steeper that slots directly into the glass body. I brewed my favorite herbal teas right in the kettle, eliminating the need for an extra steeping container. When the steeping’s done, the included drip tray catches any extra liquid—no mess, no stress. I also appreciated the 30-minute keep-warm feature, which saved me from reheating water when juggling multiple tasks.

**Good Points**  
- Elegant borosilicate glass construction resists breakage.  
- Six temperature presets are ideal for varied tea brewing needs.  
- Stainless-steel tea steeper included for direct brewing.  
- Thoughtful 30-minute keep-warm function.  
- Compact docking base with hidden cord storage keeps countertops tidy.

**Critiques**  
- The beep signaling the end of the tea’s brew is a bit faint.  
- It’s slightly on the heavier side with a 3.75-pound weight.  
- Hand-wash care might not be everyone’s favorite chore.  

**Other Options**  
Comparing this kettle to others in the same price range like Cuisinart’s PerfecTemp series or Breville’s Smart Kettle Luxe, it holds up well. The PerfecTemp is feature-rich but lacks the borosilicate glass elegance and integrated tea steeper that this one offers. On the other hand, Breville’s model takes the edge with its custom temperature settings, though it comes at a higher price point. For those prioritizing both aesthetics and functionality, this kettle delivers a unique blend that few others can match.

**Bang for the Buck**  
As a tea aficionado who values both performance and design, I’d say this kettle is worth considering. Its price sits comfortably within what you’d expect for premium small appliances, yet it offers enough features that set it apart from the competition. The convenience it provides—from its presets to the built-in tea steeper—justifies the investment for anyone who uses a kettle daily. However, if you’re looking for the bare-bones functionality of boiling water, you could save a good amount opting for a simpler model.

I am unemployed living at home due to a disability. Since I am home, I often take on chores around the house daily and help with up keep. Some of these tasks include doing dishes, tidying up, cleaning the bathroom etc. My father works on his own schedule and is often home.

Now we are on the day of September 10th (I'm not trying to make this political but it is important for the story) Charlie Kirk had just been shot and my parents are very conservative. My father began watching videos of this over and over and obsessing over it, his anger growing as he dwelled on it.

I was packing for my trip and I also had a therapy session to attend, so I loaded the dishes into the dishwasher and then went to do what I had to. The dishwasher was not finished for more than 30 minutes before I stepped out of my room, immediately met with my father incessantly reminding me of multiple things I had to do at once.

I simply said ""I take care of this every day, please don't give me a task list I know what needs to be done."" and this made him snap. 

He flung the dishwasher door open and began screaming at the top of his lungs at me. He then began grabbing mugs and smashing them into the cabinet with an intense force. His actions terrified me and I began shaking. I quickly threw on whatever clothes I had and left my house with nowhere to go.

I just walked and walked. For about 3 miles I wandered aimlessly. I get a text from my mom about the trip we are supposed to go on, how I'm ruining the trip by saying I no longer want to go and how I made the entire thing about me. She text me that she spoke with my father and she looked in the cabinet and nothing was broken.


I then receive a text from him saying he apologizes and he only did that because of what happened to Charlie Kirk. (???)


We returned from our trip today (Yes, he acted up the entire time with anger toward everyone about small things) and I went to make coffee and found several shattered coffee mugs which I had purchased.  I photographed them and sent them to my mother who said something along the lines of 'must have missed those'

Someone who’s not perfect, but profoundly real. I’ve lived a few lifetimes already in this one. Loved deeply. Lost harder. Learned more than I bargained for. But somehow, I’m still here, heart open, soul tuned like a frequency… listening.

This isn’t a dating app bio. It’s a beacon.
⸻

What I’m Building (With You, Maybe):
A life that feels like music, children’s laughter, campfire smoke, and night drives.
Deep talks that slide into dumb jokes and back again.
Healing. Together. Without shame.
A partnership that’s devotional—but still leaves room for air, growth, and goddamn joy.

A space where your softness is safe, and my strength is sacred.
⸻

Who You Might Be:
You’re not afraid of your past, but you’re not defined by it.
You’ve done some inner work—enough to recognize your patterns, your gifts, and when you’re dysregulated.
You’re smart, kind, spiritual, emotionally aware, funny when you least try, and open to loving again… even if it scares you.
You’ve likely been misunderstood before, but you’re not bitter. Just wiser. And selective.
Deep in the way you’ve also noticed how life seems to much more complex, like magic guides the way, things are divinely orchestrated and there is beauty in the insignificant.

Bonus points if:
You love music and aren’t afraid of slow dancing in the kitchen.
You believe in signs, even if you also believe in therapy.
You’d rather be real than right.
⸻

Who I Am:
39	Dad of two beautiful souls (10 and 13). They’re with me part-time, but they’re my world.

Artist. Writer. Musician. Former HR exec. Aspiring mystic. Soul cartographer.

Half coffee, half philosophical overthinker.

I love music, concerts, mixed-media art, symbolic dreams, and boxing (the sport, but also my actual Boxer dog named Charlie).

I’ve healed a lot. I’ve owned my mistakes. And I show up—when it counts, and when it’s inconvenient.
⸻

What I Don’t Want:
Anything casual or chaotic.
Someone still chasing validation instead of peace.
People who love-bomb but can’t hold space.
Surface-level attraction without spiritual resonance.
⸻

Things That Matter:
I’m based in Dallas, Texas but open to long distance with the potential hope you’d relocate (or miracles).
I am open to more kids, and would embrace yours like kin.
I believe divine timing is real, but so is discernment.
I’ve got a home, a dog, and a Spotify playlist that says more than I ever could.
I’m not perfect, but I’m present.
⸻

The Vibe:

Let’s build something poetic, grounded, playful, and real.
Let’s text like teenagers and trust like grownups.
Let’s co-create a love that’s sacred—but not sanitized.
Let’s fall in love while living with our eyes open.
Let’s be the calm in each other’s nervous systems.

The problem: keeping track of everyone’s needs, interests, and goals in your head (or in scattered notes) is nearly impossible.

That got me thinking: what if there was a platform designed specifically to manage and nurture your most important relationships? Something that helps you stay intentional about the people who matter most.

She went from being terrified of people and especially other dogs, to being extremely social. When I tell her we are going outside, she gets very excited. She loves riding in the car. She’s super good with other people and dogs. Great at coffee shops, downtown, the dog park, etc… She is the 100% perfect dog and the best dog I’ve ever had outside of home.

But…

When she’s at home, that energy just goes away. She hides. When I call her name, she thinks she’s in trouble and crawls up to me slowly with her tail tucked and submissively urinates. When I approach her, she shrinks down or flinches. If she goes into her cage, it extremely difficult to get her to come out.

If I leave and come back home, she’s clearly happy I’m home, but won’t approach me and it if I approach her, she’ll flinch in fear or run to her cage with her tail tucked.

I bring her anywhere other than home and this all goes away. In fact, she knows the words “outside”, “park” and “coffee shop”, and if I say those, she gets so happy, even at home.

I don’t know what to do to help her realize she’s not in trouble.

And here’s the kicker: she will not accept food while anxious. Doesn’t matter what it is. Doesn’t matter how much she loves it. She will not eat unless she is in a mood where her tail is wagging. 

So I can’t use food to make her more comfortable.",1,1757954875.0,DogAdvice,1,1.0,False

My wife and I (both 24) invited a long time friend (23) of mine to come visit after not hanging out for a few years. Me and this friend lived together for 2 years, and we've been friends since high school, so I was really excited to catch up on each other's new adult lives.
The second they got here, they rushed to the bathroom before giving any hellos or hugs, and then when they came out they were very energetic and happy to see me. I was so ready for the weekend, they were staying fri-sat and we had plans to meet up with other mutual high school friends that live in my area as well. 
The weirdness started when we were getting ready to go out on the first night. They were chugging all the alcohol in sight before we even left the house, and were visibly *fucked up* before we got to the car. Like, falling down the stairs and tripping over their feet type drunk. They werent driving so I thought okay I guess we're going really hard tonight! On the way there, as my wife drove and they were in the front seat, they were all. over. her. Hands on thighs, talking about how DESPERATELY they want to each some ""kewchie"" (yes they spelled it out for us) and just being overall SO handsy and weird. My wife and I are in an open relationship so that part was fine, it was really unexpected and surprising. 
Well... they were actually so visibly messed up that they werent allowed into the club when we got there. I was already in and a drink deep already by time they were denied entry, but I came outside to see what they thought. They said it was ableist of them to deny them entry, since they were legally blind and weren't wearing glasses, which is why they stumbled and looked glassy-eyed to the bouncer. I knew they were fucked up but I comforted and supported their feelings, and we ended up going to grab some food and after that my wife and I went home while they and the other friends stayed out later.
Friend comes home around 2am, and I stayed up to make sure they made it since I knew they'd be even more drunk than earlier. They came home and immediately stripped down to nothing, no underwear, and asked to borrow a big shirt becausethey **had** to feel like they werent wearing any clothes, and alternated between sitting on both of our laps while we smoked a joint before bed. It raised more red flags for me, and at this point I was pretty annoyed with them for being SO SO SO fucked up this night that I couldnt even talk to them about something normal without them being really over the top about everything they said. They were acting so weird and butting into conversations incoherently  for the rest of the night. I'd never seen them so drunk. 
The next morning, my favorite thing to do when we have guests is to make them coffee and breakfast. While I was preparing the coffee, my wife comes to me saying the cap on her whiskey bottle was missing, and there was a noticeable amount gone from it as well. Neither of us drank from it last night, so obviously is was my friend. I apologize to my wife and immediately go confront my friend. They play dumb and say they didnt even know we had whiskey. Huh!? Okay. Im really pissed off now. You can be weird to me, whatever, but when you start stealing my wife's shit and lying about it is where my boundaries get crossed. They dont even know each other that well, theyve met maybe twice before this. 
After spending another day out with friends, I had this pit in my chest all day about the whiskey and I could tell my wife was upset too but didnt want to say anything about it. When we got home that evening, I pulled my friend aside and was like look, I know you drank her whiskey. I know you lied about it. And their explanation was:
""Ok well I dont remember drinking it. And also i havent been able to afford my medication. See, my DID has really been acting up, and...""
And thats where I stopped listening. All I wanted was an apology, but they spent nearly 5 minutes spewing excuses for their behavior instead of just saying sorry. I never heard the words come out during this whole string of lies about why stealing whiskey was justified. I just told them I dont want them so fucked up they cant control their actions in my own house that I'm opening up to them, and the rest of the evening was spent silent. It almost felt like they were pouting all night because I called them out on their bs.

After they've left, I get a text from one of the other friends we were hanging out with asking if something seemed off about them this whole weekend, and went on to say they made everyone super uncomfortable after my wife and I left the first night and was trying to take clothes off of someone at a bar and was again talking about sex, a LOT. So it wasnt just us they were, dare I say, sexually harassing. It was everyone. This other friend also said that they heard friend #1 was doing coke this whole time from someone else. Which would explain their weird and abhorrent behavior, in my opinion. And why they were so incoherent and overly sexual the whole time, and acting impulsively. 
I dont know much about coke, Ive never done it myself, and I actually have some long history of trauma with it. Which friend KNOWS about, who I have told in the past it makes me uncomfortable to be around. So knowing they were likely doing coke in my bathroom this whole weekend made me lose all faith in this friend. I never want to speak to them again after this. I dont even feel like they deserve an explanation, they should know they fucked up and why I dont want to even be in the same room as them anymore. But I also wonder if I'm letting my trauma with the drug cloud my judgment here? Please give me an outsiders perspective. This happened a month ago and I'm still mentally battling with it.

1nhr381,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nhr381,Farmhouse Kitchen Renovation,"Long time lurker, first time poster. For some background, we just bought a farmhouse style home built in the 70s in the Midwest. It was a flip and we knew it needed some work, but the foundation, plumbing, electrical etc... are all solid and we love the layout and the property. The biggest project is going to be the kitchen (and we're months away from starting it, just doing some fact finding, it's functional as is). The question is what to do about the cabinets, specifically do we rehab the existing ones or just start over. They're solid wood and in decent-ish shape, though there is definitely some damage from 50 years of use and from the house settling.  The bottoms of some definitely need to be replaced. 

Keeping the original aesthetic and the character of the house is important to us. I also know that given the sheer number of cabinets it's going to be quite the undertaking, and while I have rehabbed a lot of smaller projects like bookcases and coffee tables, I'm not confident in something like this. 

Thoughts? If you've done something like this in the past, how did it turn out? The photos are just a few samples, and yes, those countertops and backsplash will be gone!

Quick backstory (so you understand the situation):

* Me & my wife got married in Las Vegas on Sept 24, 2024.
* I moved to Duisburg on Nov 6, 2024 From the US. Got my residence permit + EU driver’s license.
* My wife worked for her mom’s company, but her mom’s business account got blocked so she wasn’t getting paid.
* We decided to start our own cleaning company in Nov 2024 → took over private clients + 2 offices. Eventually grew, got our own car, and now we’re fully booked.
* In April 2025, my MIL “fired” my wife (illegally, no paperwork), secretly canceled her health insurance, but we’re all still living in her house.

Then the harassment started:

* Locked the laundry room → we have to use laundromats now.
* Locked the pantry → all our dry goods & frozen food stuck there since May.
* Installed Ring cameras inside the house (living room + kitchen).
* Keyed our brand new car with the *house key*.
* Put all our shoes in a trash bag (probably to donate).
* Constant petty nonsense on top of that.

I already filed 3 online police reports. I even told my wife: *“If she locks the kitchen, I’m calling the cops.”*

**Sure enough, on 13/09/25 she locked the kitchen door** while my wife was sick and couldn’t even make tea.

So I called the Polizei:

* First asked if my reports were reviewed → they said it can take up to 2 months.
* I explained the situation, asked if they could send someone. Told them it’s not urgent, just want assistance.
* My MIL must’ve heard me through the Ring camera because she rushed home to unlock the kitchen before they came.
* Polizei arrived \~1 hour later.

When they got there:

* My wife explained everything.
* We showed them proof of harassment (screenshots, reports, etc.).
* MIL had cut the electricity so we couldn’t print reports or charge phones.
* Yelling battle started because she accused me of “breaking her coffee machine with oil” (never touched it).
* Polizei told us: *“There’s nothing we can do. You should just get a hotel until you move out.”*

They admitted the situation is weird but said since it’s a “family dispute,” unless someone physically assaults someone or damages property, they won’t do anything. Instead, they told us to get a lawyer.

So my question is: **Is this really a normal Polizei response in Germany?**  
Do they not step in for harassment like this, even with multiple reports and evidence? Are we seriously just expected to deal with this until we move out in 3 weeks?

**TL;DR**: MIL went crazy after we started our own cleaning business → locked laundry room, pantry, installed cameras in shared spaces, keyed our car, even locked the kitchen. I filed 3 police reports. Finally called the cops when the kitchen got locked, but they basically said, “nothing we can do, get a hotel until you move out.” Is that really normal here?",0,1757954603.0,germany,57,0.38,False

These are the wines I managed to get pictures of the individual bottles but we definitely tasted everything.


**2018 Henri Boillot Puligny 1er Cru Monopole ""Clos de la Mouchere"", Beaune, Burgundy**- Unfortunately this bottle was just too young, and was showing suuper tight. Still, there was lemon, some lime, salinity, some iodine, and hazelnut. Fresh and crisp. 


**2005 Simon Bize Savigny-Les-Beaune 1er Cru ""Aux Vergelesses"", Beaune, Burgundy**- Showing extremely well, lots of tart cherry, pomegranate, hints of spice, steak juice and even a slight graphite note. Fantastic Burgundy I'd happily buy again. 


**2019 Champagne Marc Herbrart ""Special club""**- Super fresh but still with lots of lees notes, this had apple, white peach, a hint of sourdough, oyster shell, and weirdly, a slight licorice/anise note. Excellent wine and my first special club Champagne.


**2023 FX Pichler Gruner Veltliner ""Loibner"", Wachau, Austria**- A little on the young side, this has green apple, lime, wet stones, white pepper, and a chicken stock umami characteristic. Needs time to develop but should be fantastic.


**2022 Julian Haart Rielsing Kabinett ""JJ"", Mosel Valley, Germany**- My first ever Julian Haart, the grapes come from Goldtropfchen and Falkenberg, this was easily one of the white WOTN contenders, loads of ripe peach, ripe apple, ripe clementine, lemon and lime juice, white flowers, petrol, crushed stones, and a lovely acidity. 


**2021 Yvon Metras Beaujolais, Beaujolais**- A truly wild experience. Tart cranberry, underripe watermelon, underripe strawberry, higher acidity, and surprisingly not super funky, but definitely super natty. Not the style I typically go for in a wine, but impressive none the less. 


**2022 Guy Breton Morgon ""P'tit Max"", Beaujolais**- Corked


**2016 Domaine Dugat-Py Gevrey Chambertin, Cote de Nuits**- Showing fantastically well. Deep tart and black cherry, ripe black raspberry, mushroom, potting soil, super integrated tannins and a really enjoyable acidity. Great Gevrey, and an enjoyable experience with Dugat-Py.


**2007 E. Guigal Cote-Rotie ""La Landonne"", Northern Rhone**- My second ever ""LaLa"", and one of my longest-standing Bucket List wines. Plum, blackcurrant, redcurrant, strawberry, leather, smoke, smoked beef/beef jerky, Asian 5 spice, white pepper, cinnamon, crushed stones, Turkish coffee, and so many more. Unsurprisingly WOTN.


**2011 Louis-Benjamin Dagueneau ""Les Jardins de Babylone"" Moelleux, Jurancon**- A lesser-known Dagueneau made from Petit Manseng, this had grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, passion fruit, melon, pineapple, honey, the tiniest hint of caramel, white flowers and more. 

There are a few bottles I didn't manage to get individual photos of, so if you are curious about the Ricci Curbastro Franciacorta, Leflaive Macon, Girardin Meursault Perrieres, Billecart Rose, Mas de Daumas Gassac Blanc, Littorai Pinot, Failla Pinot, or Donnhoff Auslese, just let me know!

Backstory. I (55F) went into a local upscale boutique. That day I had just left physical therapy so I was a bit of a mess. I browsed for about 30 minutes & a sales girl was talking with another in Spanish commenting on how I looked poor & wasn't going to spend any money. She continued to comment on how ""ugly"" I was & when I asked about some charms she ignored me. Now, it's important to note I am multilingual. I understood everything that she was saying about me, and acted as if I didn't. I continued about and did end up making a small purchase. However, her comments really nagged me.

Fast forward 2 weeks. I intentionally dressed to the tea with my high-end charm necklace on as well as my high-end jewelry knowing all the well I was going to return to this boutique with hopes that she would be there.  

Immediately, upon arrival, said employee greeted me with a smile, and assisted me with my selection. She was super attentive, even brought me a small coffee. At that moment, the owner happened to be there. It is important to note that I am friends with the owner and we are members of an exclusive club. We make small talk & she asks about my spouse (who is a well known community member), etc. Keep in mind, said sales girl can hear all of this. 

I proceed to make my purchase (well over $300) & as she's packing up my items I pretend to be on a call & proceed to speak Spanish. (I can see her turning white.) As I gather my purchase, I speak to her in Spanish with a smirk & remind her not to judge people on looks as it'll come back to hurt them. It's important to note they make commission on their sales.

Some ideas for guys and gals who struggle to find things to talk about:

2. What do they like to do with their free time? If you know anything about any of what they list, follow that line of conversation.

3. What do they like about their church?

4. If they could live anywhere else, where and why?

For everyone, I would recommend looking up therapeutic communication, which includes techniques such as asking open-ended questions, clarification, and empathy statements. It can sound a little goofy at first, but when you learn how to employ them in a way that comes naturally to you, it makes you a more enjoyable person to talk with and your conversation partner will feel more engaged.

Being chronically online has degraded modern conversation skills so that many are no longer comfortable chatting with others they don't know in person. Practice staying off your phone in public and saying hello to strangers, starting conversations in checkout lines, etc. Older ladies are great to practice when you first start, as they tend to be friendly and are often receptive to small talk and respond positively to compliments. Get used to talking to people you don't know and talking about things that matter.",9,1757954273.0,ChristianDating,3,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Phillies vs. Dodgers: A Slugfest for the Ages (With a Side of Sarcasm)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a night where baseball’s version of two overfed toddlers throw pies at each other—except the pies are 98 mph fastballs and the toddlers are Shohei Ohtani and Kyle Schwarber. The Los Angeles Dodgers (-135) host the Philadelphia Phillies (+202) in a game so packed with offensive firepower, it’s like a fireworks show where every spark turns into a home run. Let’s parse the chaos.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Jamboree

First, the cold, hard stats:

* **Dodgers**: 5.1 runs per game, 217 HRs (1.5 per game), and a lineup that includes Ohtani (49 HRs) and Mookie Betts (.410 SLG). Their home dominance (48-26) is as reliable as a Netflix password.
* **Phillies**: 4.8 runs per game, 191 HRs, and Kyle Schwarber (52 HRs) who’s basically a human wrecking ball with a batting helmet. Their lefty starter trio (Suarez, Sánchez, Luzardo) has combined for 39 wins—like a boy band but with more strikeouts.

**The Pitchers**: Ranger Suarez (2.77 ERA, sinker-changeup artist) vs. Emmet Sheehan (3.32 ERA, rookie with 69 Ks). Suarez is the “steady hand” in a rotation that’s seen more turbulence than a Delta flight to Denver. Sheehan’s fastball-slider combo is like a double espresso: sharp, quick, and likely to keep the Phillies’ patient lineup (they draw 8.1 SO/9) on edge.

**Implied Probabilities**: The Dodgers’ -135 line implies a 57% chance to win, while the Phillies’ +202 suggests bookmakers think Philly’s magic number (1) is more of a curse than a clincher.

---

### News Digest: Injuries, Motivation, and Ohtani’s Coffee Habit

* **Phillies**: Just lost 10-3 to the Royals, a team that once traded for a bag of beans. Their “lefty trio” is intact, but their bullpen added Jhoan Duran via trade—think of him as the relief pitcher version of a fire extinguisher.
* **Dodgers**: Secured a playoff spot with a 10-2 rout of the Giants, thanks to Teoscar Hernandez’s four-hit performance. Ohtani, meanwhile, is one home run away from a caffeine-induced coma.

**Key Takeaway**: The Phillies need this game like a diabetic needs insulin—they’re one win from clinching the NL East. The

She’s not on Instagram, and while we’re in the same branch, she’s in a different subgroup, so I don’t interact with her much otherwise. I also don’t want to do the whole “sending notes on WhatsApp” thing—it feels unnatural to me.

1nhqrtm,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1nhqrtm/trying_to_set_up_a_neighborhood_activities/,Trying to set up a neighborhood activities committee without it being hijacked by the ward,"So here’s the deal: I’m on the HOA board in my neighborhood. We’re trying to start a **Neighborhood Activities Committee**—the idea is to plan a couple fun, inclusive activities each month (coffee meetups, BBQs, game nights, park days, whatever).

First suggestion that came up? “Oh you should meet with the ward activities committee.” 🙄

Nope. Hard pass.

The problem is: the ward *already* has built-in structure—callings, committees, access to printers, funds, and everyone in their network knows each other. But that structure only includes people in the church. The rest of the neighborhood (exmos, nevermos, anyone not plugged into that system) is left with basically two options: church events, or nothing.

Members \*believe\* that their activities are open to the entire community and that everyone is welcome -- but in practice we show up as a family but they immediately divide into men/women and the children segregate into neat little age groups and we are clearly the outsiders without any hope of integration.

I don’t want “church or nothing.” I want an actual alternate option—neutral, secular, community-wide—where neighbors can meet each other without being funneled into a proselytizing opportunity. This isn’t about me being anti-church; it’s about making sure vulnerable or disconnected members of the community have **another way** to get to know their neighbors besides walking into a Relief Society activity or a ward BBQ that is advertised as ""everyone welcome"" but has strings attached and the missionaries are there.

So here’s how I’m thinking of framing it for our HOA FB group:

* Committee is by and for HOA residents.
* Activities are inclusive and secular, open to everyone.
* We’ll focus on planning and advertising neighborhood activities, not ward activities.
* Outside stuff like city events is fine to share, but no cross-advertising with churches.

Basically: if you live here, you’re invited. Period.

My question for you all:

* How do I keep this boundary clear *without* turning it into a culture war in the FB group?
* Any tips on wording so it’s obvious we’re not a ward-auxiliary while still sounding neighborly?
* And if you’ve been in similar situations—how did you keep the church from swallowing community stuff whole?
* Do you know your neighbors?  Do you plan things with your neighbors?  How do you accomplish that without structure like the church provides?",11,1757954072.0,exmormon,8,0.93,False

In fact, sophia had been awake for a long time, but she hadn’t made a sound. She was staring at ethan in amazement. He was right.

""The reed family really does want me back. But why?""

Sophia jumped in shock when she heard ethan demand that eric come personally to pick her up. eric was always arrogant and full of himself. He would never agree to ethan ’s request—not in a million years. ethan was provoking him by forcing him to personally invite her back.

ethan hung up the phone. “Fine. If eric refuses to come, then forget it! Goodbye!”

Sophia shoved him. “Are you crazy? How could you ask my grandfather to come and fetch me? I suggest we just go back ourselves and drop all of this. Clearly, something very serious is going on—I could hear it in their voices.”

“No, just wait. Three… two… one…”

And sure enough, Sophia ’s phone rang the moment ethan finished counting down.

It was Hunter ’s voice: “My father agreed to come pick you up. Now give me your address!”

“—The Star Hotel, in University City!”

“—And what’s your room number?”

ethan cut in: “No need for that. We’ll come down ourselves when eric arrives.”

He said this to prevent eric from backing out.

“Huh? Is my grandfather really coming?”

Having lived under eric’s shadow since childhood, Sophia trembled, terrified.

She was so frightened she completely forgot ethan ’s earlier prediction—eric will invite you back himself.

About half an hour later, a Mercedes-Benz stopped in front of the hotel. Soon, eric was within sight.

“Come on, let’s go down.”

Sophia ’s hands were shaking as she clung tightly to ethan ’s arm, unwilling to let go.

When Hunter saw her, he blurted out, “Sophia, there you are! Get in the car! Grandpa wants to discuss something important with you!”

Sophia was stunned to see a gentle smile on eric ’s face.

“When has Grandpa ever smiled at me before?”

Inside the car, eric spoke: “I’ll get straight to the point, alright, Sophia? Didn’t you once work on the Eco-Super Flower Garden Development Project? Well, now’s your chance. Mr. alex from the Ministry of Construction requested that you present the proposal and explain the plan to them. You must give it your all! I believe you can do it!”

And so, just a few minutes before eight, Sophia and ethan arrived at the office building of the official in charge of the project.

alex greeted them warmly: “Miss reed, you’re here! Would Miss reed and this gentleman like some tea or coffee?”

ethan replied casually as he sat with elegance: “One tea for me, and a coffee for Sophia.”

sophia was utterly astonished.

“That’s Mr. alex! The man in charge of administration at the Ministry of Construction!”

Even daniel  cole had to bow when he saw him.

“Why is he being so polite to me?”

alex turned to his secretary: “Did you hear that? Go make the arrangements now.”

Then he said respectfully to Sophia: “Miss reed, please, have a seat.”

ethan nudged her, “Come on, sit.” Seeing her stiff as a board, he pulled her down to sit beside him.

Soon after, the tea and coffee were served.

Sophia lifted her cup with both trembling hands, while ethan sat proud and domineering, radiating arrogance. alex stood before them like a waiter—humble, respectful, not daring even to look ethan in the eye.

This was that legendary man!

Sophia took a deep breath, stood up, and presented the proposal: “Mr. alex, I am Sophia reed. I’m honored to meet you, and here is my proposal. Please, take a look!”

alex chuckled: “Your ability speaks for itself, Miss reed. We can put the proposal aside—we place our full trust in you.”

Sophia coughed nervously…

When alex met ethan ’s terrifying gaze, he quickly snatched up the proposal and began reviewing it with several project leaders, while Sophia explained the details.

About half an hour later, alex stood up with a smile. “We were right about you, Miss reed! It’s perfect! The plan is ninety-nine percent flawless! After we make a few adjustments on our end, it will be perfect.”

Sophia whispered to ethan: “Does he mean we’ve got the project?”

alex nodded: “We received thirty-three bid submissions in the first round, and right now Miss reed has the highest score! We’ve already assessed the capacity of Sustainable Vision and the reed Group—you’re more than qualified to carry this project out. Now we just need to follow procedure and sign the contract in three days.”

sophia knew everything was settled!

ethan rose, pulled Sophia along, and said as they left: “Thank you.”

“What? No, no thanks needed!”

Hearing ethan ’s words of thanks nearly made alex collapse to his knees in fear.

Even after they left, sophia still felt like she was dreaming.

eric and dozens of others surrounded her outside: “Sophia, how did it go?”

“We passed the first selection! I had the highest score—ninety-nine! Mr. davis asked me to return in three days to sign the contract. I… we’ll be responsible for carrying out this project. But since they’re still processing the paperwork, we must keep this confidential.”

At first, Sophia had wanted to say she would handle the project on her own. But the moment she saw eric, her tone shifted involuntarily.

eric was thrilled, and so were the others: “Excellent! I’m so proud of you, Sophia! You’re the pride of the reed family!”

After all, this was a billion-dollar project. Sophia could recall only two times her grandfather had ever praised her. The first was when she married ethan, the rising star, six years ago. And now, this praise felt surreal.

eric asked again, still a little uneasy: “sophia, are you certain we’ve secured this project, and all that’s left is signing the contract in three days?”

Sophia nodded firmly: “Yes, that’s right. I’m sure.”

eric breathed a sigh of relief. “Good. That puts my mind at ease.”

Afterward, ethan, Sophia, and the reed family went their separate ways and returned home.

Hunter laughed: “That was unexpected, Father! We really got the project! I even asked my friend to check with Mr. davis’s secretary—it’s true!”

eric’s face lit up. “Yes, this is a great joy for the reed family.”

adam, after hesitating for a long while, finally asked: “Grandfather, are you really going to give Sophia full authority to handle this project? I’m worried that with ethans wild ambition, this project won’t have anything to do with us when the time comes.”

eric chuckled: “Oh, adam, I’ve already thought about that! Didn’t you hear me just now? The project is ours now. All we need to do is sign the contract in three days. After that, Sophia will have no value. Besides, can little Sustainable Vision really complete a billion-dollar project?”

“You all will go and sign the contract after three days! I only gave Sophia the title in name. I have no intention of letting her actually participate in carrying this project out.”

adam grinned wickedly. “That’s a clever move, Grandfather!”

When they returned home, Michael and Kayla looked at ethan in astonishment.
“You were right. The father really did come to personally invite Sophia.”

Michael wondered aloud, “But how can we possibly get this project? There are so many stronger companies here. Why would they choose us?”

Sophia closed her eyes, waiting for ethan ’s explanation.
“Yes… why were they so insistent that I be the one to sign the contract?”

She couldn’t help but suspect that ethan was the reason—every single word he spoke kept coming true.

ethan asked calmly, “Don’t you remember what logan  hayes said at the banquet that night?”

Michael immediately replied, “I understand now! That’s what logan  hayes meant! Of course, a big figure always keeps his word! I mean, who else do you think could order Mr. davis around?”

Sophia blushed with embarrassment. “I thought logan hayes was just saying empty words.”

ethan smiled faintly. “When a powerful man speaks, his words must come true.”

Michael ’s excitement grew. “My God, our family is about to soar to the heavens once we take on this project! Kayla, prepare the best dishes—we’ll celebrate tonight!”

Perhaps because of their good mood, ethan appeared even more charismatic in the couple’s eyes.

Sophia said softly, “Don’t worry about finding a job, ethan. Stay with me.”

“Of course. I’ll make sure to help you well.”

Three days later, ethan and Sophia dressed in formal suits, ready to go and sign the contract.

Sophia hesitated. “ethan, I think I should inform my grandfather. They’ve been very anxious about this project.”

ethan shook his head. “I don’t think that’s necessary. This has nothing to do with them anyway.”

“Still, I feel I should call them.”

She dialed eric’s number.
“Grandfather, I’m calling to let you know we’re going to sign the contract now.”

eric replied quickly, then hung up right after.
“Oh, that’s fine. Your sister and adam are already on their way there, so you don’t need to go. Don’t worry—they’ll sign on your behalf! Leave this matter alone and just go work at Sustainable Vision in peace.”

Sophia was so shocked she nearly dropped her phone.
“What… what did he just say?”

She sighed. “Grandfather said this has nothing to do with me, and someone else has already gone to sign the contract in my place.”

ethan ’s blood boiled when he heard that.
The reed family was exactly like the cole family!

ethan muttered in a low, steady voice, “Don’t worry. No one can take what belongs to you.”

He turned, pulled out his phone, and sent a message directly to the head of the Ministry of Construction.

Meanwhile, at the bidding venue, a number of businessmen had gathered, waiting for the results to be announced.

In the end, the deputy head of the Ministry of Construction stepped forward and declared:
“I hereby announce that the Floral Ecological Park Project will be undertaken by Sustainable Vision of the reed Group!”

The crowd erupted in commotion at the announcement. No one could understand why Sustainable Vision had won.

adam, sandra, and the others who had gone as representatives of Sustainable Vision rose to their feet, accepting congratulations from those around them.

“May the representative of Sustainable Vision come backstage to sign the contract!”

The actual person responsible for the signing, however, was alex davis. The deputy head had only come to announce the results.

When alex saw them, disgust flickered in his eyes.
“Them? Where is Miss sophia?”

adam stepped forward politely. “It’s my pleasure to meet you again, Mr. davis. Sophia is very busy at the moment, so she sent us to sign the contract on her behalf.”

sandra added quickly, “Besides, the bidding results have already been announced. We’re determined to take on the project, so what difference does it make who signs the contract, Mr. davis?”

alex chuckled coldly. “Oh, there’s a very big difference, my dear. Let me ask you something—for example, if you’re here on behalf of Miss sophia to sign the contract, would you sign her name, or someone else’s?”

sandra faltered. “I… uh…”

Of course, they hadn’t planned to sign Sophia ’s name—they intended to sign eric’s.

After all, if they signed Sophia ’s name, wouldn’t that make her the sole owner of the project?

Jackson chimed in quickly, “By the way, Mr. davis, perhaps you don’t know. Although the reed Group has many subsidiaries, the true head is Mr. eric reed, who has absolute control over everything. This time we’ll be signing the contract under his name—with Sophia ’s approval, of course.”

alex shook his head firmly.
“That will never happen. We appointed Sophia reed to oversee this project. I don’t know who this eric reed is that you’re speaking of. But since you insist, I’ll call Miss sophia myself. If she agrees, then I’ll allow it.”

The three immediately panicked, knowing full well that Sophia had no idea about this and had never given her consent.

alex dialed Sophia directly.
“Miss sophia, may I ask—did you agree to let someone else sign the contract in your place, and under the name of Mr. eric?”

The moment she heard this, Sophia knew—if she said yes, the project would no longer belong to her. But if she refused, she feared her grandfather would hate her for life. She was trapped, forced to choose between family ties and her own interests.

She hesitated, on the verge of agreeing—when ethan suddenly snatched the phone from her hand.

He spoke firmly, “No! They haven’t gotten your approval. What is going on here? At worst, I’ll back out of this project and give it to whoever wants it!”

After hanging up, alex glared coldly at adam and the others.

Realizing how grave the situation was, they lowered their heads, too frightened to meet his eyes.

“I was clear, wasn’t I? Miss sophia must be the one to handle this project from beginning to end! No one else can take her place. If you insist on this nonsense, I’ll assign the project to someone else. There are plenty of people capable of managing it. Listen carefully—if you want this project, bring Miss sophia here to sign the contract now! Otherwise, I’ll consider it abandoned!”

Hearing this, the trio fled in fear to avoid disaster.

When eric found out, he was stunned.
“What? It really has to be Sophia? I thought anyone could sign!”

Hunter asked anxiously, “Father, what should we do now? Do we really have to let Sophia take on this project?”

eric scowled. “There’s no other way. But even if she does, most of the profits will still fall into our hands. Sophia is still obedient to me! We’ll give her a small portion when the time comes. After all, her little company, Sustainable Vision, can’t possibly manage such a project alone. They’ll need our help.”

Someone asked nervously, “But grandfather, how do we make Sophia sign the contract? This is the second time already.”

eric sneered. “Hmph! I’ll go and drag her there myself if I have to. I won’t take no for an answer. Call her first!”

When they called, however, it was ethan who picked up.
“Huh? No need for you to come. We’re busy.”

Then, ethan hung up directly.

Like many of you here, we've spent way too many nights and weekends wrestling with a dozen different APIs, trying to stitch together reliable data for our trading models. One API for real-time prices, another for options, a sketchy one for sentiment, and then hours of cleaning it all up before an LLM can even touch it.

It's a pain. And it’s a huge time sink that gets in the way of what we actually want to do: build and test new strategies.

That's why we built PlusE Finance MCP Server. Our goal was to create the single, clean tools for AI we always wished we had. One that's designed from the ground up for modern AI and LLM-powered trading.

We're pretty excited about it and wanted to give you guys a first look.

So, what is it?

It's an AI-first financial data server. You hit our API, and you get everything you need to power your trading agents, without the usual headaches.

Here's what we focused on:

* The ""It Just Works"" Part (Seriously, like 5 mins): We obsessed over making the tool simple. The idea is you can go from zero to pulling meaningful data into your system in the time it takes to brew a coffee. Less boilerplate, more alpha.
* Built for AI, Not Just Bolted On: This isn't just another data endpoint with ""AI"" slapped on it. It’s designed to feed models (especially LLMs) the structured data they need. Think less time spent on preprocessing, more time on generating signals.
* All The tools, One MCP: We got tired of juggling subscriptions. We’ve bundled in the stuff that matters:
   * Real-time & historical market data
   * ML-powered predictive analytics we've built in
   * Full options chain data (Greeks, IV, the works)
   * Who's actually moving the market? (13F filings, insider trades, major shareholders)
   * Market sentiment and economic data (from FRED, etc.)

And yeah, we have a free tier.

We're building this for developers and quants like us who want to push the boundaries of AI in finance. We're just getting started and would love to hear your thoughts, gut reactions, or what features you'd kill for.

We'll be sharing more technical details and docs soon.

Stay in the loop

and

Cheers,

She’s not on Instagram, and while we’re in the same branch, she’s in a different subgroup, so I don’t interact with her much otherwise. I also don’t want to do the whole “sending notes on WhatsApp” thing—it feels unnatural to me.

If you’re a girl, what would you think in this situation? How should I approach her without making it weird or awkward? Any suggestions would be really helpful.",1,1757953927.0,DatingInIndia,0,1.0,False

I’m 5’1 and 120 lbs. I work out 5-6 times per week (both strength training and running) and aim for <2000 calories per day. A decent amount, I know, considering I’m 5’1 and female. TDEE calculators estimate my maintenance anywhere from 1800-2400.

I swear to god I must be going insane.

""You're not really hungry you're just bored. You're thirsty. You're depressed. You're lonely. You're ____"" I can be with my friends, post meal, post water, post coffee, having a good time, and feel HUNGRY.

I'm this close 🤏 to legitimately crying because I am quite certain that I'm hungry. But everything I read is like ""is the hunger in the room with us?""

And now I don't know what to believe. I swear this is causing me physcial pain. Yes I know it's illogical for me to be hungry when I'm eating enough. I understand. But I do FEEL hungry? I don’t want gum. I don’t want a popsicle. I don’t want a ton of veggies.

I want eggs and greek yogurt. I would devour a huge bowl of either right now. And yes I’ve already met my calorie and protein goals for the day. There does definitely need to be a limit.

At what point is the hunger real?? Am I making it up? Am I crazy? Like am I literally delusional and just think I'm hungry? If it’s really all in my head why do I feel it? Please tell me I’m not genuinely insane.

I do all the tips and tricks. I follow all of the advice. I am still hungry. I eat enough calories that I’m not losing weight. I shouldn’t be hungry. But I feel as though I’m starving. My body is being dramatic. ",11,1757953882.0,WeightLossAdvice,20,0.82,False

A little about me: I stay balanced through fitness, whether it’s hitting the gym, keeping active with workouts, or kick-starting my mornings with a run (don’t worry, I’m usually faster than my excuses). I also love traveling—not for the miles, but for the stories and snacks along the way.



I especially enjoy connecting with people who are a bit older than me—I find there’s so much to learn from your experiences, perspectives, and humor.

1nhqnsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreeceTravel/comments/1nhqnsp/athens_visit_5_days_in_athens_in_june/,Athens Visit - 5 days in Athens in June,"Last year I went to Athens and Crete in June and I got in love with the city and its worderful ancient places.

I started my time with a foot tour, which I really suggest you because you get to know better where are the main sites and get to know the city, its history and culture and also some useful tips from the guide. It was a great way to start our trip. Or if you prefer, you can go for a food tour ([authentic greek](https://www.getyourguide.com/athens-l91/the-greek-food-discovery-in-athens-t154137/?partner_id=3KSY27J&cmp=RedditAthens) or [hidden gem](https://www.getyourguide.com/athens-l91/explore-the-hidden-food-gems-of-athens-t460396/?partner_id=3KSY27J&cmp=RedditAthens))

We ended nearby Anafitiloka and Plaka neighbourhood and Roman agora and we have decided to go back to Plaka and eat in the great tavernas over there. Great dishes with a good price.

Afther that we would have gone to Acropolis museum but we had no sleep (got a night flight) and we were really tired so we went to check-in and got some rest time as we had Acropolis booked for 5pm which was a great time to see it. 

We entered Acropolis at 5:15 and we had no line, just enter the site and I was there till 8pm (closing time). It was great to feel the space with time, to take some time to just experience and feel it (not only rushing by it) and next time I'll go for sure on a tour to have an even more interesting experience ([Acropolis and Mythology Highlights](https://www.getyourguide.com/activity/-t60865?partner_id=3KSY27J&cmp=RedditAthens) or [small group Acropolis](https://www.getyourguide.com/activity/-t138953?partner_id=3KSY27J&cmp=RedditAthens)). I would suggest you to take some time after the tour to enjoy it on your pace. Then we finished to see sunset in the little hill by north entrance of Acropolis: aeropagus hill

Tip: enter the site by south entrance to pass for the theathre and then go till the north entrance and go up from there. On your way out go to aeropagus hill or if you visit Acropolis earlier, go to Filopapos Hill nearby north entrance of Acropolis. I went one day there for sunset and I've liked it more than Licavitus Hill. 

official websites for tickets:  
acropolis + other arqueological sites: [https://hhticket.gr](https://hhticket.gr)   
acropolis museum: [https://etickets.theacropolismuseum.gr](https://etickets.theacropolismuseum.gr/)  

Next day we went to visit Temple of Zeus, Panathinakos stadium, National Gardens, Syntagma Square and we have walked around the stores in Plaka as well going to Acropolis museum (if you sleep well you can do it on the 1st day) and then we went to [Cape Sounion/ Temple of Poseidon for sunset tour](https://www.getyourguide.com/activity/-t212919?partner_id=3KSY27J&cmp=RedditAthens). You can also go on a tour with [Cape sounion + Lake Voulagmeni ](https://www.getyourguide.com/atenas-l91/cabo-suniao-excursao-de-5-horas-durante-o-por-do-sol-t102461/?partner_id=3KSY27J&cmp=RedditAthens)

Next day it was our day with a [full day tour to Delphi and Arachova](https://www.getyourguide.com/atenas-l91/de-atenas-viagem-de-1-dia-a-delfos-e-arachova-com-guia-de-audio-t212853/?partner_id=3KSY27J&cmp=RedditAthens), it was really great. The meeting point was on a metro station nearby Athens highways so we had almost no traffic and we got to Delphi around 10h30, one of the first tours arriving there. We went to visit the little ancient site (Tolos of Athena) then passed in Catalia Springs, then to the Main arqueological site (15€ for that and the museum) and then the museum. We had the full info on the bus and in Delphi each person goes with their own pace. After that we had free time for luch or visit in Arachova. We got lunch and an incredible icecream. Next time I'll go either for a [Delphi + Meteora Tour ](https://www.getyourguide.com/atenas-l91/excursao-de-2-dias-a-delfos-e-meteora-t700/?partner_id=3KSY27J&cmp=Reddit)or for [Micenes, Epidaurus and Napflion](https://www.getyourguide.com/atenas-l91/de-atenas-viagem-de-onibus-para-micenas-epidauro-e-nafplio-t212898/?partner_id=3KSY27J&cmp=RedditAthens) \+ [Aegina Island hidden gem Tour](https://www.getyourguide.com/athens-l91/athens-aegina-island-small-group-day-trip-to-a-hidden-gem-t909841/?partner_id=3KSY27J&cmp=RedditAthens). This time the call was for Delphi and I would have a 2nd part of the trip to Crete so no need for an island before there.

Next day we went to visit Roman Agora, Adriand Library and Ancient Agora. Last year we still had combined ticket (30€ for 6 arqueological places). This ticket no longer exists so I would skip Roman Agora and Adrian's Library, maybe even Temple of Zeus but Ancient Agora (along with Acropolis) really deserve a visit and take some hours to the visit. We also visited Little Kook (just visit) and eat lunch nearby roman agora, then headed to visit Monastiraqui square.

Next day we went to Kerameikos and to Socrates Lyceeum ((again, those were included in the combinet ticket) ). Lyceeum I wouldn't have gone if it wasn't included, kerameikos is interesting and it's the beggining of the sacred way from athens to Eleusis for the eleusis mysteries but, again, if you are not so interested on the spot, you might pass it. You can walk around in thissio (around Kerameikos) or go for Licavitus Hill (not far from Lyceeum). We went to the hill but we didn't like it, it's difficult to get there (you climb lots of stairs or have to pay for a taxi, then you get the funicular and you get to a hill which has not much space on top and you have a good view and a view with lots of neighboorhoods (normal houses) so for me it's done, next time I won't go for it. I really prefer the view from Filopapos Hill, you see more ancient sites and you are between Acropolis and the sea. On Licavitus hill you are looking to acropolis and then the sea. It's further away.

We have stayed in Koukaki, which I believe it's a great place to stay and we had Acropolis metro and sigrou-fix metro nearby. For sigrou-fix side you also have the tram and you have lots of nice coffees. We got the greatest breakfast with a great price there, before going to airport.

When we arrived, we have used the [Locker Point Athens ](https://www.lockerpointathens.com/portal.php?action=contact&language=en)to ave our bags, this one is inside an apartment and has a person always there so it feel really safe for us. It's also close to syntagma saquere where we arrived from the airport. 

My top things in Athens would be: Acropolis, Ancient Agora, Filopapos Hill and walking around Plaka and Monastiraqui. The tour visits were great, too.

I would also suggest you the [5 day ticket from central Athens ](https://www.oasa.gr/en/tickets/prices-of-products) for only 8,20€. it includes tram, metro and bus except special buses and in/out airport. I've walked a lot but metro was also a great help.   
  
For coming from airport you can use special buses X95 to Syntagma Square or X96 to Pireus Port for 5,5€, metro for 9€, uber or freenow apps or private transfer with [WelcomePickups](https://www.book-online-transfers.com/pt-pt/debaixodasestrelas-airport-taxi)

Strefa Pomiarowa Wiraże - Audi TTS robi robotę w Forza Horizon 5","We're entering the ""Turning"" zone, aka the corners on the La Gran Caldera volcano in Forza Horizon 5. Our car is the agile and fast 2015 Audi TTS Coupe.

The goal? 153 km/h (95 mph) and no excuses.

We start the run from the top, sticking to the inside of the corners, braking in pulses, and pushing without ESP or ABS.

The TTS shows class, the challenge is done!
