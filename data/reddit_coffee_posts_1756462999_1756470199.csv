Eng:

I received my compact Osterr yesterday, I'm trying to do some tests but whenever I try to use this filter for two cups nothing ends up coming out. First I thought it was the very fine ground coffee which made me lose some coffee while using it in the espresso maker but then I thought about using it without the coffee to see if the water would be able to come out somehow and even without coffee the coffee maker refuses or doesn't have enough power to make the water pass through the pressurized filter, what could this be indicating?

I'm quite disappointed, I've always used a moka pot for my coffees and never had any major problems, now I've decided to invest a little and this is happening...

Pt:
Recebi minha osterr compacta ontem, estou tentando fazer alguns testes por√©m sempre que tento utilizar esse filtro para duas x√≠caras acaba n√£o saindo nada. primeiro achei que era o caf√© mo√≠do muito fino o que me fez perder algum caf√© durante a utiliza√ß√£o na cafeteira do expresso mas depois pensei em usar sem o caf√© para ver se a √°gua iria conseguir sair de alguma forma e mesmo sem caf√© a cafeteira se recusa ou n√£o tem poder suficiente para para fazer a √°gua passar pelo filtro pressurizado, o que isso pode estar indicando?

Just like there is CSing trainer versus bots built-in found in the learning section of the game, we need one to warm up for activating spells and team fighting. 

Most of our endless losing streaks come from not drinking enough coffee before and during game (in ranked), and not having jumped around getting kills with our hero for days. 

All pros use the CSing trainer for warm-up. It doesn't mean they are bad at CSing. 

We need something similar for team fights against bots. Humans will prevent us from warming up because they will counter our every move. 

I want to practice Lina stun on a moving bot without human enemy nature prophet coming to kill me out of nowhere. 

In this case I will spend 22 minutes farming linken sphere instead of practicing my stun. 

That was just a warm-up üòè ~ Lina 

Please consider it. 

Crafting a lobby with bots ourselves takes a lot of mental energy and you still waste 10 minutes until bots are ready for team fights. 

Please check out Arena mode in Smite 2 or remember what mid wars in HON looked like, and create something similar. 

If you do not want to make it a separate game mode versus humans because that will dilute the player base, I understand. 

But there's no excuse for not creating a versus bots exclusive mode for team fighting warm-ups.

1n35tni,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apartmentliving/comments/1n35tni/weird_noises_has_this_happened_to_anyone_before/,"Weird Noises, Has This Happened to Anyone Before?","Hi, hopefully at least someone sees this! My apartment is pretty creaky, I‚Äôm on the fifth floor of my building, so my floor creaks and pops, my windowpanes snap, my walls creak, my fridge makes loud clicking sounds, etc. I‚Äôm not a stranger to the usual sounds of a ‚Äúhigh-rise‚Äù apartment shifting around. 

However there have been a few noises that I‚Äôve completely failed to identify and are actually giving me the creeps and making my state of living worse, though admittedly because I can‚Äôt rationalize them fully. 

One: There‚Äôs no apartments above me, and honestly barely any space visually from the outside. When I‚Äôm in my bathroom, sometimes I can hear soft thumping above me, reminiscent of when I lived on the second floor of my last apartment and had a guy who was very heavy footed living above us. This one is a little less upsetting given I think that there may be pipes or something above that area specifically. Still a bit unnerving. 

Two: This one is the big one. The whammy I suppose. A couple of weeks or so ago I adopted a cat, and she enjoys sitting on my bed with me. About a week ago, I heard something that I almost wrote off as being in my imagination, except she whipped her head around to stare in the general direction of my closet/bedroom vent. The noise, from what I can remember, sounded like a mix between someone (not distinguishably male or female) and a pig retching like they were throwing up but nothing was coming out. I was highly weirded out but honestly thought nothing of it besides ‚Äúcreepy ew, whatever.‚Äù Except this morning around 3:50AM it happened again. I was shifting around because Gaia was sleeping right in the middle of the bed (typical cat) and I wanted to get comfortable without disturbing her too much. Admittedly I was pretty tired, but right as I was settling down I swear I heard the exact sound, paired consequently with my TV randomly switching on to Netflix. The remote was sitting on the coffee table. (I did scour reddit, this isn‚Äôt uncommon for TVs and I am taking it with a grain of salt, just trying to explain how weirded out I am haha.)

Now. I don‚Äôt believe in ghosts. I don‚Äôt want to find answers to this or figure out a plan based on the paranormal. Of course it‚Äôs unsettling and now I can‚Äôt sleep, and I am quite paranoid (anxiety disorder) but I am also a logical person. I believe there‚Äôs a reason for this noise, despite how staggered it is, assuming of course it hasn‚Äôt happened while I‚Äôve been asleep. 

Is there any real reason for hearing this? Is this a common sound for some sort of apartment appliance that I‚Äôm not aware of? Is there a young adult or possibly a pig hiding in my walls? This building is not old, an article claims the apartment building was completed in 2015.

Any help or advice or an answer is super appreciated, I love this place so much despite these noises and slightly strange occurrences. 

Thank you so much!

1n35nli,https://youtu.be/aTXNogkvR0c,4 Very Scary TRUE Next-Door Property Horror Stories,"# ""The Basement Prison"":

I remember the summer my sister Sylvia and I ended up living with Mrs. Baniszewski and her kids. Our parents worked at carnivals, traveling from town to town, and they needed someone to watch us. Dad found Mrs. Baniszewski through a friend. She lived just a few blocks away in Indianapolis, in a rundown house on East New York Street. It seemed like a normal place at first, with kids running around and laundry hanging out back. She agreed to take us in for twenty dollars a week. ""I'll treat you girls like my own,"" she said with a thin smile when we arrived with our small suitcases.

Sylvia was sixteen, a year older than me, and she had this bright way about her. She liked skating and listening to records. I was quieter, with my leg brace from polio making me limp a bit. Mrs. Baniszewski‚ÄîGertrude, she told us to call her‚Äîhad seven kids of her own. Paula was the oldest at seventeen, bossy and quick to snap. Then there was Stephanie, John, Marie, Shirley, James, and the baby. The house was crowded, with peeling wallpaper and a musty smell from the basement. We shared a room upstairs with some of the girls.

The first few weeks went okay. Sylvia helped with chores, washing dishes and folding clothes. We went to church on Sundays, and Gertrude even let us have ice cream once. But then the money from Dad started coming late sometimes. He was on the road, and mail got delayed. Gertrude would get angry about it. ""Where's my payment?"" she'd ask, her voice sharp like a knife. Sylvia would try to calm her. ""It'll come soon, I promise."" But one day, when the check was a day late, Gertrude grabbed a paddle from the kitchen and hit Sylvia across the legs. ""That's for lying,"" she said. Sylvia cried out, but she didn't fight back. I stood in the doorway, too scared to move.

After that, things got worse slowly, like a pot heating up on the stove. Gertrude started picking on Sylvia more. She'd accuse her of stealing food or talking back. ""You're nothing but trouble,"" Gertrude would say. Paula joined in, slapping Sylvia when no one was looking. The neighborhood kids started coming over‚Äîboys like Coy Hubbard and Richard Hobbs. They were teenagers, rough around the edges, and they'd laugh when Gertrude yelled. One afternoon, Sylvia came home from school with a note about gym class. Gertrude read it and flew into a rage. ""You think you're too good for exercise?"" She made Sylvia run up and down the stairs until her legs shook. I whispered to Sylvia later, ""We should tell Dad."" But she shook her head. ""He'll be back soon. Don't make it worse.""

By September, the beatings happened almost every day. Gertrude used belts, her fists, anything nearby. She'd burn Sylvia with cigarettes, pressing them into her arms while saying, ""This is what happens to bad girls."" Sylvia's skin got covered in red marks. She stopped eating much, and Gertrude locked the food away. ""If you're hungry, eat this,"" Gertrude once said, handing Sylvia a bowl of soup with bugs floating in it. Sylvia gagged but forced it down. I tried to sneak her bread, but Paula caught me. ""Mind your own business, cripple,"" Paula hissed. The kids in the house watched, some joining in. John, who was only twelve, would kick Sylvia when she was down.

One night, after everyone went to bed, Sylvia whispered to me in the dark. ""Jenny, it hurts so much."" Her voice was weak. I held her hand. ""We'll get out of here,"" I said. But deep down, I felt trapped. Gertrude told us if we ran, she'd find us and make it worse. The basement became Sylvia's prison. Gertrude dragged her down there, tying her hands. ""You're filthy,"" she'd say, forcing Sylvia to stay naked. The air down there was cold and damp, with spiders in the corners. I could hear Sylvia crying sometimes, but Gertrude forbade me from going down.

The neighborhood boys came more often. Coy and Richard would take turns hitting Sylvia, egged on by Gertrude. ""Show her who's boss,"" Gertrude would laugh. One time, Richard held a hot needle while Gertrude carved words into Sylvia's stomach. Sylvia screamed, ""Please stop! I didn't do anything!"" But they kept going, spelling out something awful. Blood dripped onto the floor. I peeked from the stairs, my hands shaking. Later, Sylvia could barely move. ""Why me?"" she asked me when I snuck down with water. Her eyes were swollen shut.

Our parents visited once in early October. Dad and Mom came by, but Gertrude acted sweet. ""The girls are fine,"" she said, smiling. Sylvia and I sat quietly, too afraid to speak. After they left, Gertrude turned to Sylvia. ""What are you going to do now? They're gone."" The abuse got even crueler. Gertrude made Sylvia insert a glass bottle into herself in front of everyone. The kids laughed. Sylvia begged, ""No, please."" But Gertrude pushed her. ""Do it, or it'll be worse.""

By late October, Sylvia was barely alive. She had over a hundred burns, her body thin like a skeleton. Gertrude rubbed salt into her cuts, making her writhe in pain. One day, Sylvia wet herself because she couldn't hold it. Gertrude beat her for that, then left her tied in the basement. That night, Sylvia whispered to me through chapped lips, ""Jenny, I know you don't want me to die, but I'm going to. I can feel it."" I cried, ""No, hold on."" But her breathing was shallow.

On October 26, I couldn't wake her. Gertrude found out and panicked. She tried to clean Sylvia up, but it was too late. ""Call the doctor,"" she told Paula. But Sylvia was gone. The police came after a neighbor heard something. I told them everything when they took me aside. ""She hurt my sister,"" I said, pointing at Gertrude. They arrested her, Paula, and the boys.

Living through that changed me forever. The house next door wasn't just a place‚Äîit was a nightmare I couldn't escape until it was over.





# ""The Quiet Man"":

I moved into that house on Maple Street back in 1995 with my wife, Elena. We were young then, excited about starting fresh in a quiet suburb on Long Island. The place felt right‚Äîgood schools nearby, friendly folks waving from porches. But the property right next to ours stood out a bit. It was older, with peeling paint and a yard that looked like it hadn't seen a mower in weeks. The man who lived there, let's call him Victor, had been in that house his whole life, or so we heard from others on the block. He was tall, broad-shouldered, with a stare that lingered a second too long when you passed by.

At first, things were fine. Victor kept to himself mostly, tinkering in his garage or sitting on his porch with a book. Elena and I would nod hello if we saw him, but we didn't chat much. Then one afternoon, about a month after we settled in, Elena came inside looking uneasy. She was out back, catching some sun in her bikini, when she noticed him. ""Honey,"" she said, her voice low as she closed the sliding door behind her, ""that guy next door... he's watching me. He stood up on something and looked right over the fence.""

I frowned, setting down my coffee. ""You sure? Maybe he was just checking his yard.""

She shook her head, crossing her arms. ""No, he was staring. And when I looked up, he tried to say something, like 'Nice day, isn't it?' But it felt off. Please talk to him.""

I didn't like it, but I figured it was a misunderstanding. The next day, when I saw Victor outside watering his plants, I walked over to the fence. ""Hey, Victor,"" I called out, keeping my tone even. ""My wife mentioned you were looking over yesterday. She's not comfortable with that. Mind keeping to your side?""

He paused, turning slowly to face me. His expression didn't change much‚Äîno anger, no surprise. He just nodded once. ""Understood,"" he said flatly. ""Won't happen again."" And that was it. He turned back to his hose like nothing happened. I expected more pushback, maybe an argument, but his calmness threw me. I went back inside and told Elena, ""He said he'd stop. Seems straightforward.""

She bit her lip. ""Okay, but he gives me the creeps. Let's just avoid him.""

For a while, it worked. Victor stopped peering over, and our interactions stayed minimal. Over the years, we'd exchange polite words if our paths crossed‚Äîthings like ""How's the family?"" or ""Storm coming, better batten down."" He married a woman named Clara around '96, and they had kids eventually. But his house always seemed cluttered, with boxes piled in the windows and odd hours of activity. Sometimes I'd hear hammering late at night from his garage, or see him loading heavy sacks into his truck before dawn. I chalked it up to him being an architect, maybe working on projects at home.

Elena never fully relaxed around him. ""There's something not right,"" she'd say every so often, especially when news broke about those bodies found along the beach a few towns over. It started in 2010, reports of remains wrapped in rough fabric, dumped like trash. The victims were young women, mostly, and the police called it the work of one person. We'd watch the updates on TV, and Elena would glance toward the window. ""Imagine if it was someone close by,"" she'd whisper. I'd reassure her, ""It's probably some drifter from the city. Not here.""

But little things built up. One summer evening in 2007, I was grilling burgers when I caught Victor standing at his window, just... looking our way. Not moving, not waving. I raised my hand, and he stepped back into the shadows. When I mentioned it to Elena, she shivered. ""See? That's what I mean. Why does he do that?""

I confronted him again the next morning, knocking on his door. He answered quickly, shirt tucked in neat, like always. ""What's up?"" he asked, his voice steady.

""Last night, you were at the window,"" I said. ""Staring at our yard. It's making us uncomfortable.""

He blinked, then shrugged slightly. ""Didn't mean to. Was thinking about work. I'll close the blinds more."" Again, no fight, just agreement. He even offered, ""If it helps, I can put up a taller fence between us."" I declined, but his offer stuck with me‚Äîtoo eager to fix it, almost.

Time rolled on. Our kids grew up, played in the yard, and Victor's family did their thing next door. He was anti-social with most neighbors, but with me, he'd occasionally stop for small talk about traffic or the weather. ""Busy roads these days,"" he'd say, his eyes drifting past me. I never invited him over, and he never pushed. But Elena avoided him completely. ""I don't like how he looks at me,"" she'd confess in bed at night. ""Like he's measuring something.""

Then came that day in July 2023. I was home from work early, fixing a leak in the sink, when sirens blared down the street. Police cars flooded the block, lights flashing, officers in vests swarming Victor's property. Elena rushed in from the garden. ""What's going on? Is it a fire?""

I stepped outside, heart racing a bit from the chaos. Cops were everywhere, taping off his yard, carrying boxes from his garage. A detective approached me. ""Sir, you live next door? We need you to stay back. This is an active scene.""

""What's happening?"" I asked, my mouth dry.

He hesitated. ""Arrest in a murder case. Your neighbor, Rex‚Äîer, Victor. He's in custody.""

Elena grabbed my arm. ""Murder? What murder?""

We watched from our porch as they dug up parts of his yard, hauled out computers, files, even guns‚Äîhundreds of them, hidden away. News vans arrived, reporters shouting about the Gilgo Beach killings. That night, on the TV, they showed his face: our neighbor, accused of strangling those women, binding them, leaving them by the ocean. The details poured out‚Äîhow he'd lured them with promises, used his phone to taunt families, kept a blueprint in his basement for ""supplies"" and ""disposal.""

I felt sick. Elena paced the living room. ""All these years... he was right there. Remember how he stared? What if...""

""Don't,"" I said, but my mind raced. Later, when more came out‚Äîa hard drive with his notes: checklists for bodies, a section on ""targets"" saying ""small is good."" Elena is petite, five-foot-two. The thought hit like a punch: had he considered her? Those peeks over the fence, the window stares‚Äîwere they scouting?

We talked late into the night. ""I always knew,"" she said, tears in her eyes. ""But who believes that about a neighbor?""

The searches dragged on. They found hair from his wife on the tape used on victims, though she wasn't involved. His house, that cluttered old property, hid vaults of weapons and secrets. Neighbors gathered, whispering how he'd always been odd, how kids avoided his door on Halloween.

Even now, with him locked up, I can't shake it. Walking past his empty house, boards on the windows, I wonder what else is buried there. The police say there might be more victims, unsolved cases stretching back decades. Elena sleeps with the light on some nights. ""What if he gets out?"" she asks. ""Or if he had friends?""

I try to calm her, but deep down, the fear lingers. That next-door property, so ordinary, held a monster. And we lived beside it for thirty years.





# ""Tragedy on Lawn"":

I moved into the small row house on Lawn Street in South Oakland back in the early 1990s, hoping for a quiet life in Pittsburgh. The neighborhood had that old-city charm, with houses squeezed close together, sharing walls and backyards. My place was right next to Ann's, and from the start, she became like a sister to me. Ann was in her forties, a music teacher with a gentle smile and a love for playing piano late into the evening. I could hear her melodies drifting through the thin walls sometimes, soft and comforting. We bonded over coffee in her kitchen, talking about our dreams for our homes. She had just bought hers, excited to paint the rooms and plant flowers out front.

The house on the other side of Ann's was empty when I arrived, boarded up and forgotten. Paint peeled from the siding, windows were cracked, and weeds choked the tiny yard. It looked sad more than anything, like a place time had left behind. Then, one day in 1995, a man named Roy showed up. He was young, maybe late twenties, with messy hair and a quiet way about him. He bought the place cheap, saying he planned to fix it up. At first, Ann and I thought it was good news. ""Finally, someone to bring life back to it,"" Ann said to me over tea one afternoon. ""We can all work together to make this block nicer.""

Roy started with small jobs, hammering nails and ripping out old carpet. But soon, things went wrong. He tore down gutters without replacing them, so rainwater poured off his roof straight onto Ann's wall, seeping inside and staining her bedroom ceiling. She mentioned it to him politely one morning while he was outside. ""Roy, that water is causing damage. Could you put the gutters back up?"" she asked. He nodded, mumbled something about getting to it soon, but weeks passed, and nothing changed. Then, junk started piling up in his yard‚Äîbroken furniture, rusty tools, bags of trash. Rodents showed up, scurrying along the shared fence. Ann found mouse droppings in her basement, and it made her uneasy.

""I don't know what's going on over there,"" Ann confided in me one evening as we sat on her porch. ""He's always working late at night, banging away. And the smell... it's like something rotting."" I nodded, because I'd noticed it too. From my window, I could see into his backyard, where shadows moved behind dirty curtains. Roy rarely spoke to anyone, but when he did, his eyes darted around, like he was hiding something. Once, I caught him standing still in his doorway, just watching Ann as she watered her plants. He didn't wave or say hello; he just stared until she went inside.

The problems grew. Ann's wall started to mold from the water damage, and she worried about her health. She called the city's health department after I suggested it. ""It's not fair,"" she said to me on the phone. ""I worked hard for this house. He needs to take care of his."" Inspectors came, cited Roy for violations, and fined him thousands. That lit a fire under him, but not in a good way. He began arguing with Ann through the wall, yelling things like, ""Mind your own business! This is my property!"" I'd hear it from my side, the voices echoing. Ann looked tired those days, her face pale. ""He's getting angrier,"" she whispered to me one night when I came over for dinner. ""People at work say I should be careful. They think he's unstable.""

Roy appealed the fines, dragging Ann into court hearings. She had to testify about the damage, the rodents, the junk. I went with her to one session, sitting in the back. Roy glared at us from across the room, his hands clenched. After, in the hallway, he walked up close to Ann. ""You shouldn't have done that,"" he muttered, his breath hot. ""You'll regret it."" Ann stepped back, her voice steady but scared. ""Just fix your house, Roy. That's all I want."" I pulled her away, my arm around her shoulders. ""Let's go,"" I said. That night, she locked all her doors and windows, even though it was warm.

As months turned into years, Roy's house fell further apart. No electricity, from what we could tell‚Äîcandles flickered in his windows at night. Strange noises came from there, scraping sounds like metal on concrete, especially late. I'd lie awake, listening, wondering what he was doing. Ann called me once at midnight. ""Do you hear that? It's coming from his basement."" I listened through the phone; it was a low grinding, like a saw. ""Probably just repairs,"" I said, trying to calm her, but doubt crept in. Roy bought more properties nearby, but he let them decay too, spreading the mess. The whole block felt tainted.

By early 1997, the feud peaked. Another court date was set for March 25, to decide on Roy's latest appeal. Ann was nervous but determined. ""This has to end,"" she told me the day before, as we walked our dogs. ""I can't live like this anymore."" That evening, I saw Roy outside, digging in his yard with a shovel, dirt flying. He looked up, saw me watching, and smiled‚Äîa cold, empty smile that made my skin crawl. I hurried inside.

The next morning, I knocked on Ann's door at 8:30, as planned. We were supposed to drive to court together with another neighbor. No answer. Her car was there, lights off. ""Ann? It's me,"" I called, knocking harder. Silence. Worry knotted in my gut. We checked the back, peered through windows‚Äînothing. ""Something's wrong,"" I said to the other neighbor. We called the police.

Officers arrived, forced entry into Ann's house. It looked normal at first, her piano sheet music on the stand, coffee cup in the sink. But in the basement, they found a hole in the wall, leading right into Roy's place. Dust and debris everywhere, like someone had broken through. My mind raced‚Äîwhat had those noises been? Police went next door, and that's when the horror unfolded.

They found Roy inside, calm at first. But in his basement... Ann's body, cut apart, pieces in trash bags. Strangled, they said later, with a cord, then dismembered with a saw. The hammer nearby, bloodstains. I didn't see it, thank God, but hearing the officers talk, seeing their faces pale, it hit me like a wave. Ann, my friend, gone in the worst way, right next to where she felt safe.

Roy screamed as they arrested him, ""Just kill me now!"" They put him in the van, cuffed. Thirty minutes later, he was dead too‚Äîhanged himself with his belt somehow. The end came quick, but the fear lingered.

I still live here, but the house next door stands empty, a reminder. Every creak at night, every shadow, brings it back. What starts as a simple disagreement can turn into something dark, hidden behind walls we share.





# ""The Boy"":

In the quiet stretches of Tennessee's Cumberland Plateau, where homes sit far apart and the roads wind through thick woods, life moved slow for us kids. Our family place was a simple spot, carved from Grandpa's land, with a big yard that backed up to a path leading to Malcolm's Pond. Folks from around town would cut through to fish, and it never bothered us much. That's how I first noticed John Chapman, the boy from up the road. He was a few years older, maybe thirteen or fourteen when I was ten, with his sister in school just ahead of me. Their house was a quarter mile away, close enough to wave hello but not to share meals or anything like that.

John would stroll by in the summers, fishing pole over his shoulder, nodding if he saw us outside. My folks thought nothing of it‚Äîeveryone fished there. But as time passed, around when I hit middle school, things felt off. My older sister came home from her first year of college, all grown up with her deep auburn hair catching the light. She got a job at our great-uncle's grocery store downtown, stocking shelves and ringing up customers. One day, she found a note tucked under her car's windshield wiper, right in our driveway. It was scribbled in pencil: ""You look nice today."" No name, but she knew it was from John. He'd been hanging around the store more, buying little things like gum or soda, staring a bit too long.

""Sis, did you see that guy again?"" I asked her one evening as she sat at the kitchen table, folding the note over and over.

She nodded, her face tight. ""Yeah, John. He left a flower this time. I told him I'm not interested, but he just smiled and walked off.""

We laughed it off at first, calling him awkward. Mom said boys that age don't know better. But it made her uneasy enough to lock the car doors at night. John stopped the notes after she spoke up at the store, but he kept walking the path to the pond, his steps slower when he passed our house.

High school brought its own changes. I was fifteen, discovering music and laying out on our big wooden deck to tan in the afternoons. The deck faced the woods, away from the highway, so I felt private in my swimsuit, radio blasting pop songs. One hot day, Mom rushed out the back door, her eyes wide. ""Get inside now,"" she said, voice low and urgent.

I grabbed my towel, confused. ""What? Why?""

She pulled me in and shut the door, peeking through the curtains. ""John's out there in the woods, watching you. I saw him from the kitchen window. He wasn't fishing‚Äîjust standing there.""

My skin prickled. I pictured him hidden among the trees, eyes on me. After that, the deck lost its appeal. I'd glance at the woods and wonder if he was there, silent and still. We told Dad, who said he'd have a word if it happened again, but John was clever about not getting caught.

Our town was small, under a thousand souls, and bad things happened now and then, chipping away at the peace. Our house got broken into three times over the years. The first was when I was little‚Äîsomeone smashed the kitchen window while we were at church, took Dad's guns, Mom's jewelry, even my piggy bank full of quarters. We came home to glass on the floor and drawers yanked open. ""Who would do this?"" Mom whispered, hugging me close as Dad called the sheriff.

The second break-in was worse. They trashed everything‚Äîclothes pulled from closets, papers scattered, food dumped from cabinets. It felt personal, like anger poured out on our things. Dad boarded up the windows tighter after that.

Then there was the fire. Dad's garage out back, full of tools and his old Jeep, went up in flames one night. We woke to the crackle and glow, rushing out as sirens wailed in the distance. Arson, the fire chief said‚Äîsomeone stole what they could and torched the rest. No one saw a thing.

Grandpa and Grandma's place, closer to town but still tucked away, had its scares too. Late one evening, two men knocked, saying their car broke down up the road and could they use the phone? Grandpa let them in, but they lingered, eyes darting around. ""Something's not right,"" he told us later. He grabbed his shotgun from the closet and asked them to leave. They backed off quick, but we all wondered what they really wanted.

Another time, Grandma was in the bathroom when she spotted a face at the window‚Äîa man peering in. She screamed, and he bolted into the dark. The sheriff found footprints but no one to match them. ""Stay vigilant,"" he advised, but in a place like ours, vigilance meant locking doors and hoping.

All this built a quiet fear in me, but nothing compared to what came later about John. It was 1990, I was out of high school by then, when Michelle Blake vanished from her job at a gas station just outside town. She was young, pretty, with red hair like my sister's. They found her the next day in a cemetery, strangled, stabbed, assaulted. The town buzzed with shock‚Äî who could do such a thing?

Two years on, in 1992, another body turned up in the woods behind the interstate rest area in Monteagle. Same awful details: red hair, strangled, assaulted. And who worked there as an attendant? John Chapman. Whispers started, but no proof yet.

Then, that November, a woman stopped at the rest area for a break. John approached her, friendly at first, but grabbed her arm, trying to pull her toward the woods. ""Come with me,"" he said, his grip tight.

She fought back, screaming, ""Let go!"" and broke free, racing to her car. She drove to the next exit and called the police from a payphone, describing him clear as day.

They hauled John in for questioning. With new DNA tests coming into play, they matched him to both murders. He confessed, got convicted for kidnapping, rape, and killing those two women. The third one's escape sealed it.

Thinking back, my stomach twists. Both victims had that red hair, just like my sister. His notes, the flower‚Äî was that the start? And me on the deck, unaware of his eyes on me. What if he'd acted on it? Our next-door path to his fishing spot, our shared small town, hid a monster building inside him.

Even now, I lock every door, glance at shadows in the woods. The property next door wasn't just land‚Äîit was a doorway to something dark, waiting to step through.",1,1756469306.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

A few years ago I went through exposure therapy and got from a place of being locked inside my home completely unable to leave for years, to being in a place where I could leave whenever I wanted, and even go abroad. One of the best things I've ever done. It works. But you have to do upkeep. I've been slacking on the upkeep due to various factors, chronic illness being a big one, and now going outside is horrifying again. I've got an opticians appointment in 2 hours, and I'm sitting on the bathroom floor trying to keep my breathing deep and slow so I don't panic. If I don't keep control, a panic attack is going to happen and I'm not letting that happen. I'm going to go, and I'm going to treat myself by buying some beauty bits, and then go to one of my favourite shops and reward myself with a candle and some spooky stuff if they have some. Then I'm going to come home and make a huge coffee and get really cosy and probably cry and feel proud. It's going to be exhausting but worth it.

‚Ä¢ Books - I‚Äôd love to start a little book club together.
‚Ä¢ Spooky games - bonus points if it‚Äôs Phasmophobia!

But after trying Onyx again and realizing I don't like them much at all, especially after their recipe for the India Ratnagiri made potentially the worst cup of 2025, I wondered ""Who else might be like Brainwave?"".

Small, passionate, pushing the envelope?

Then I remembered u/swroasting.

And just by dumb luck, I checked the website about an hour after coffee was made available, and I had my pick.  I didn't realize how hot of a commodity they've become!

Here's what I grabbed and why (all roasted on 8/19), in the order I'll probably be trying them out to let them rest appropriately:

[**Columbia Santa Monica Lulo CoFerment:** ](https://www.swroasting.coffee/product/colombia-santa-monica-lulo-coferment/112?cp=true&sa=false&sbp=false&q=false&category_id=2)The Bergamot, the nod to the Norena Hop CoFerments, and the ""most approachable"" note made this a no-brainer.

[**Columbia Santa Monica Strawberry co-ferment:**](https://www.swroasting.coffee/product/colombia-santa-monica-strawberry-coferment/107?cp=true&sa=false&sbp=false&q=false&category_id=2)  sweet, strawberry creme-saver?  I'm in.

Berry and caramel notes are right up my alley.

[**Columbia Santa Monica Lychee Honey Process:** ](https://www.swroasting.coffee/product/colombia-santa-monica-lychee-honey-process/76?cp=true&sa=false&sbp=false&q=false&category_id=2) Very Sweet, Very Fruity.  I'm a sucker for a sweet cup of coffee.  Maybe all those spros in Napoli over the years.  :).

I've gone from wondering if I liked Co-ferment offerings to absolutely loving them from the right roasters.  Especially since fruity Ethiopian and Tanzanian offerings have been hard to find.

Looking forward to September (dang, should have ordered from September too).  All in all I'll have 6 great beans to enjoy (Including the Norena Galaxy Hop!)

1n35emh,https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTipping/comments/1n35emh/member_question/,Member question,"I have a legitimate question. Why is it that every time someone posts a receipt on here, there are people racing to complain about the cost of the menu items?

Dining out is a luxury. As such, there is a premium price attached to it. It's not an every day occurrence, nor should it be. If it is an every day occurrence for someone, I'll feel bad for the person, but that's it. That person earned their wages and decided how to spend it.

It's obvious it's cheaper to cook at home. Why pay $15 for a burger and fries when you can make them at home for less than $10 for the same servings? Because of reasons, whether it be don't feel like cooking, don't have time to cook, can't cook, whatever. And yes, some of these items we see priced are beyond expensive, they're absurd.

But using that logic, why do you spend $1.25 on Kraft dinner when the store brand is $.75? Why do you spend money on any branded items? Why do you buy beef when you can buy a quarter cow and process it and thaw as needed?

Why do you buy coffee? The human body only needs water to survive. Better yet, why buy bottled water when you can use the tap for far less? Why use city water when you can set up rain barrels and use that?

If a restaurant is pricing itself ridiculously, it will price itself out of business. Some people will see the prices and turn around and leave. If business is down and the owner reaches out and finds out it's due to overpricing, then the owner will do one of two things- reduce prices or ultimately shut down.

I'm not trying to make people feel bad about recognizing prices are ridiculous at some places. Here's looking at you $6 for two strips of bacon. I'm just tired of seeing posts about a tip situation being hijacked into griping about pricing. The real frustration for this sub is the entire tipping situation that is trying to spread past the US.

One of the product's biggest wins is the ""no-prep"" required approach. The Durgol solution arrives ready to use straight out of the bottle. Just read the instructions for your appliance or surface, pour or spray it on, rinse, and you‚Äôre done. Time saved is sanity gained, especially for individuals like me who have zero patience for mixing powders or prepping solutions.

**A Broad Spectrum of Usability**  
What impressed me most is how this isn‚Äôt limited to just household machinery. Beyond my usual appliances, I gave my ceramic bathroom tiles a test run after spotting some dull white streaks of calcium accumulation. The descaler worked wonders there too, restoring the shine I thought was long gone. A friend even borrowed some to restore her outdoor stainless steel grilling equipment, which came out looking almost new. Honestly, the versatility is its secret power.

**Favorable Aspects**  
The product comes with a few notable strengths that make it stand out:  
- Breaks down hard water stains and calcium like a pro without much scrubbing.  
- No residual odors or funky aftertaste left behind on cleaned items.  
- Compact bottle with clear instructions, making it beginner-friendly.

**Areas for Improvement**  
Of course, no product is flawless. I did encounter minor critiques as I continued using it:  
- The bottle size could have been slightly larger, especially for large-scale cleaning projects.  
- The price point feels a tad steep for single-use projects if you're new to descaling.  
- A stronger cap seal might help prevent spills during transport.

**Market Rivals**  
When stacked against popular alternatives like CLR or white vinegar solutions from the grocery store, the Durgol 0296 Universal Descaler undeniably outshines in speed and efficiency. While vinegar can sometimes leave an unpleasant lingering smell, this Swiss-manufactured descaler leaves no trace that it was ever there. Compared to other descalers that rely on citric acid, such as Breville's cleaning powders, this product pulls ahead in cutting through the toughest mineral deposits without requiring repeat treatments. It‚Äôs more heavy-duty but still gentle enough to feel safe for use on premium appliances.

**Best Value**  
In terms of financial value, there‚Äôs no denying that this isn‚Äôt the cheapest option in the cleaning aisle. However, with its impressive versatility and potent formula, it feels like an investment rather than an expense. Imagine having one solution that works across your entire household equipment‚Äîkettles, coffee machines, tiles, faucets, showerheads, and more. That‚Äôs a lot of bang for the buck without needing multiple products to handle each issue individually.

I've made previous attempts, but it didn't really work out. So now I'm hoping to meet someone I can spend time with and maybe share some good convos and simple adventures. Who knows, a single date might open doors for eternity.

I'm introverted by nature but can carry a conversation when there's a genuine connection. I'm a CPA working in Manila. I'd like to believe I'm kind and generally a nice person. I'm financially stable, single, and usually flies solo, but lately l've been wanting more social interaction. Would love to hang out with someone who's into cafe/resto hopping (not really for the coffee but for the ambiance), watching movies, checking out new places, or just doing random fun stuff when time allows.

I usually prefer chatting first (depends on the vibe), and I'm hoping to meet someone who's in the search for something lasting and not just to pass time. Being a Big 4 grad would be a plus, but at the very least, l'd love to meet someone sensible and engaging to talk to. And someone who has aspirations in life and can inspire me to be a better person.

Heads up though! I am a bit on the heavy side, but have been actively working on it since early this year. So far, malayo na but still a bit more to work on! Alsoooo, I recently found out that I'm clingy and might be too much for some people. Hopefully this time, I find someone who'll embrace me as is?",2,1756468506.0,PhR4Dating,1,1.0,False

The¬†sharp¬†clunk¬†snapped¬†her¬†out¬†of¬†it.¬†

Right¬†now,¬†she¬†was¬†still¬†a¬†senior¬†at¬†Aloville¬†Medical¬†School,¬†fresh¬†off¬†nailing¬†the¬†written¬†exam¬†for¬†Professor¬†David¬†Lawson‚Äôs¬†elite¬†research¬†

While¬†Josie¬†was¬†digging¬†for¬†answers,¬†rumors¬†about¬†Natalie¬†plagiarizing¬†spread¬†like¬†wildfire,¬†

David‚Äôs¬†project¬†was¬†a¬†big¬†deal‚Äìfirst¬†of¬†its¬†kind¬†in¬†the¬†country,¬†with¬†a¬†team¬†of¬†rockstar¬†researchers,¬†including¬†five¬†of¬†Josie‚Äôs¬†seniors.¬†

Those¬†five¬†had¬†been¬†her¬†crew¬†since¬†sophomore¬†year,¬†always¬†having¬†her¬†back¬†in¬†class¬†and¬†life.¬†They¬†were¬†family.¬†

She¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†that¬†gullible¬†girl¬†anymore.¬†She¬†knew¬†the¬†truth:¬†Natalie¬†spread¬†those¬†rumors¬†herself,¬†playing¬†the¬†victim¬†to¬†turn¬†everyone¬†against¬†Josie.¬†

Depression?¬†Just¬†a¬†sob¬†story¬†to¬†make¬†the¬†seniors¬†fawn¬†over¬†her.¬†

But¬†that¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†the¬†point¬†now.¬†Josie¬†wanted¬†to¬†know¬†how¬†Natalie¬†jacked¬†her¬†thesis without¬†leaving¬†a¬†trace.¬†

In¬†her¬†old¬†life,¬†she‚Äôd¬†refused¬†to¬†apologize.¬†The¬†mess¬†blew¬†up,¬†the¬†school¬†investigated,¬†and¬†they¬†found¬†nothing¬†on¬†Natalie.¬†

Meanwhile,¬†Josie¬†got¬†hit¬†with¬†a¬†disciplinary¬†record,¬†her¬†seniors¬†called¬†her¬†heartless,¬†and¬†that¬†stain¬†wrecked¬†her¬†job¬†prospects¬†after¬†graduation.¬†

Not¬†this¬†time.¬†She¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†taking¬†the¬†fall.¬†If¬†someone¬†was¬†going¬†down,¬†it¬†sure¬†as¬†hell¬†wouldn‚Äôt¬†be¬†her.¬†

The¬†next¬†morning,¬†Josie¬†steeled¬†herself¬†to¬†eat¬†humble¬†pie¬†and¬†make¬†her¬†public¬†apology¬†

She¬†threw¬†on¬†her¬†backpack¬†and¬†stepped¬†out¬†of¬†the¬†dorm,¬†chin¬†up¬†despite¬†the¬†knot¬†in¬†her¬†gut.¬†

When¬†he¬†was¬†stressing¬†over¬†grad¬†school¬†apps,¬†Josie¬†had¬†pulled¬†all‚Äìnighters¬†hunting¬†down¬†research¬†and¬†reference¬†books for¬†him.¬†She‚Äôd¬†never¬†owed¬†him¬†or¬†any¬†of¬†the¬†guys¬†a¬†thing.¬†

* **dream career:** pathology is set as my current goal ( studying medicine at the moment ), but i also find some interest in neurology. psychiatry is interesting on paper, but i think i lack the empathy required to build a rapport with such patients. neuroscience was a briefly entertained thought back in high school. the brain is fascinating. 
* **hobbies:** i write poetic prose. surrealism. romace. some horror. my favourite author is haruki murakami, but overall, i like fiction, realism ( + magical realism & surrealism ), horror ( psychological, mystery, cosmic ). i tend to dislike self-improvement books. romance is like a rare quilty pleasure. and yes, drinking coffee is a hobby; go-to order is macchiato. i loved affogato though...
* **artists/bands:** i tend to listen to music rather than artists, but these are some that lurk around my playlists most often. to put my music taste into genres, i'd say it's alternative and indie rock, synthwave, dark electronic, and occassional classical. 
* **fav movie:** 'heathers' is a little unusual because i dislike high school settings, but i like the dark comedy and sarcasm. 'collateral' is a little nostalgic, but i love the action and things happening in the course of one night. 'hush' is what i consider a bad slasher... it's endearing though. and 'lord of the rings' trilogy i consider a cinematic masterpiece.
* **fav mythology/spirit:** i'm not big on mythology, but kelpies are rather eerie and regal. i love their aesthetic.

I have workmates/friends whom I trusted for two damn years. But then one day, we decided to have coffee outside to chill. The five of us had small coffee drinks, laughters, or jokes. Since I had to go home that day, i left early and few hours later I saw their stories taking selfies together without me. I replied to their stories but they just got me a bare reaction. So i left every GC we had to see if they care but took days before they added me back. They added me not just because they want to add me back really but they saw my close friends‚Äô story about not being seen or cared. Now the question, is it right to cut them off slowly?

- A comfort read but slow paced, siguro dahil na-""lost in translation"" ako‚Äîthe writing style could've been better if it was not oversimplified. Kaso it was just a translated book so understandable naman.
- Nevertheless, ang ganda ng premise ng each chapter. They did not disappoint. My favorite would be the second chapter I guess hehe
- Magical realism at its finest, at least for me. Matalino si author kasi siya lang nakaisip niyan. üëèüèª
- There were some parts na mas naextend pa sana kasi parang plot holes siya for me kaya nakakabitin, pero okay na rin siguro na as it is siya hehe

But I hit this point where my screen time was hitting 6-7 hours a day and I couldn't even tell you what I'd looked at. Just endless scrolling, and somehow still feeling bored. The brain rot was getting to me.

So I started messing with little things.

I pushed all my social apps off my home screen so I'd have to actually hunt for them, and apparently my brain is lazy because half the time I just don't bother. I also stopped grabbing my phone first thing in the morning. Those first 30 minutes, I just make coffee, go sit in my balcony sip my coffee and just look at the nature then maybe talk to an actual human(Ik it might look like a lot, but trust me doing this instead of scrolling in the bed will be lot better and then rushing to work). like my family in my case. And when I hang out with people now, I keep my phone far away so I'm not doing that just checking one thing move every five minutes.

so basically don't delete Insta, Tik Tok, or whatever you're hooked on just shove them into a random folder on the last page of your phone. Make it so you have to swipe a couple times to even see them.

I met my two friends in university a year ago and we vibed so well in class. We all happened to be looking for a place at the same time and decided to move together. A few months down the track it was okay, it was fun to live with people I knew (I came from a pretty bad living situation my first year of college so I was excited to live with people I actually knew). 

Up until now, for the past couple of months, my friends true colors are showing. They are loud, childish, messy, and annoying. They will wake me up just to tell me their cringy one night stand stories, they'll leave their plates in the sink for days on end, one of them burps louder than my dad, and their behaviour is just super childish. One of my friends comments on EVERYTHING I do (""why do you stir your coffee like that? Why dont you use your hairdryer like this? Why do you use that seasoning for your chicken?"" Etc etc)

I like them as my friends, but I realise it was a bad idea to move in with them. The two of them have more in common and hang out more frequently while I just keep to myself in my room. Its getting to a point where I start fuming when I hear her laugh (it's obnoxious).

Nero‚Äôs scream shatters the darkness.

Lazar‚Äôs eyes snap open. Blood trickles down his face. White noise fills his ears, muffling Nero‚Äôs frantic shouts.

Lazar (rasping): ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ give me a minute.‚Äù

Trying to stand up, pistol in one hand, a folded scroll clutched tightly in the other. The echo of distant gunfire rattles through the crumbling corridor.

Nero grabs him, hauling him to his feet. ‚ÄúNo time, bro! The tunnel‚Äôs collapsing!‚Äù

Lazar staggers behind him, trying to steady himself. Dust and stone fall from the ceiling, chunks crumbling with each step. Nero fires ahead, cutting swaths of shadow through the corridor.

A figure in a black robe and hood emerges, a porcelain mask of a woman‚Äôs face glinting in the dim light. It lunges at Nero with a knife. Nero fires blindly down the corridor, unaware of the attack from the right .

‚ÄúWatch out!‚Äù Lazar yells, raising his pistol just in time. His shots strike true‚Äîthe figure shudders and collapses into ash, drifting into the air like smoke.

More figures pour from the tunnel‚Äôs exit. Nero shoots in one direction, trying to hold them off, but they start coming from behind them.

Lazar reacts instantly, firing back. Precision shots tear through the shadows. Each figure crumbles into ash, the air thick with the remnants of their destruction.

They emerge into a park in Dajdovnik. Moonlight reveals the ruined crypt behind them, stones tumbling and dust rising as the last masked figures are trapped inside.

Two more figures step forward, desperate, knives ready. Lazar and Nero fire in unison. Both fall apart into ash in a synchronized cascade. The park is quiet now, except for the echo of gunfire fading into the night and the heavy rhythm of their breathing.

Lazar collapses onto the damp green grass, chest rising and falling as he tries to catch his breath. He wipes at his face, smearing blood and ash from his eyes. Beside him, Nero kneels forward, gasping for air, his words muffled and exhausted.

Nero: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over‚Ä¶‚Äù
Lazar (breathless): ‚ÄúFor now.‚Äù

They both sit in silence, the night heavy around them, lungs burning as they fight to calm their breathing. Nero drops onto the grass beside his brother, leaning back. The cold night breeze stirs through the park, carrying with it the faint smell of dust and smoke.

Nero digs into his pocket, pulling out a crumpled pack of cigarettes. He slides one between his lips, lights it, and takes a slow drag. Without a word, he hands the pack to the prince.

Lazar shifts from lying down to sitting upright.

Lazar: ‚ÄúWe should call the others.‚Äù
Nero (nodding): ‚ÄúYep.‚Äù

Cigarette clenched between his teeth, Nero flips open his old phone and dials. There‚Äôs a pause, the low hum of the line filling the silence.

Nero (into phone): ‚ÄúGuys‚Ä¶ we found something. No‚Äîthere was a surprise. I‚Äôll tell you when we meet. Yeah, Lazar‚Äôs fine. Just out of breath. Okay. We‚Äôll be waiting.‚Äù

He snaps the phone shut, sighing smoke into the night.

Nero: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll call when they‚Äôre close.‚Äù

Suddenly, the sky breaks open. Rain begins to pour, heavy and cold, soaking through their clothes in seconds.

Lazar groans, pulling himself to his feet. ‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù he mutters with bitter irony. He extends a hand and helps Nero stand.

Nero smirks through the rain, flicking away his cigarette.
Nero: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get some coffee.‚Äù

The rain beats down harder, soaking their coats, dripping from their hair as Lazar and Nero step onto the lit walkway. Each step echoes across the empty street, the glow of the lamps catching the cuts and bruises carved into their faces. Ash clings stubbornly to their clothes, making them look more like survivors of a fire than men leaving a park.

On the opposite sidewalk, people stand still. No one speaks. They only watch‚Äîsilently, almost reverently‚Äîas the two figures walk past, their presence heavier than the storm itself.

Ahead, a caf√©‚Äôs neon sign flickers, humming faintly against the downpour. Lazar and Nero move toward it, their shadows stretching long under the pale streetlights.

Inside is buzzes with life. Steam rises from mugs,  low laughter and quiet conversations fill the space. Boots scrape lightly on the floor. An adventurer laughs at a nearby table, recounting some story of distant lands. The air smells faintly of coffee and pastries, a sharp contrast to the snowy storm outside.

Then the door opens.

The place goes silent.

Heads turn. Conversations die. Even the bartender pauses mid-gesture.

A cloaked figure steps in, water dripping from the hem of her coat. Three tall guards follow, their presence commanding enough that the tables shift, clearing space,other leave. She walks toward the counter, eyes scanning the room.

Nero sits at the bar, smoke curling around him, hand resting on the counter.

She slides into the seat beside him. 

Her hand moves up, pulling back the hood. The black coat falls away, revealing a soft face framed by long black hair, piercing blue eyes.

She says nothing. Neither does Nero.

Princess Mathilda and Nero sit side by side at the bar, their silence heavy.

She speaks first, calm but with urgency in her voice:
Mathilda: ‚ÄúSorry i didn't call you, it seems the storm interferes with the phones. The castle guard delivered the message‚Ä¶ Sorry they didn‚Äôt let you in. I read it, so I wanted to speak with you in person.‚Äù

Nero leans back slightly, exhaling smoke from his cigarette. His voice is low, tense.
Nero: ‚ÄúLazar‚Äôs gone, Mati. After our quest yesterday , we came back here to receive the quest reward‚Ä¶ that bonehead‚ÄîAjai, I think‚Äîcame and took Lazar with him in some fancy car , after calling him outside to speak in private. I asked around his mansion, but he hasn‚Äôt come back since I last saw him. He doesn‚Äôt pick up his phone and‚Äî‚Äù

The princess cuts him off mid-sentence, her tone sharper now.
Mathilda: ‚ÄúAjai? The royal guard? Was the fancy car‚Ä¶ a big, long, old white car?‚Äù

Nero (nodding): ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs the one.‚Äù

Mathilda‚Äôs eyes narrow, a mix of worry and resolve.
Mathilda: ‚ÄúThe White Carriage‚Ä¶ so it‚Äôs time.‚Äù

Nero blinks, confused.
Nero: ‚ÄúWhat time?‚Äù

Mathilda leans closer, voice barely above a whisper but firm.
Mathilda: ‚ÄúThe Grand Play. Has Lazar told you about it?‚Äù

Nero: ‚ÄúHe told me‚Ä¶ it was some kind of ancient ritual of Dajdovnik he should participate in to be accepted by its people and‚Ä¶‚Äù

Mathilda‚Äôs gaze hardens.
Mathilda: ‚ÄúWe have to go after him.‚Äù

Nero leans back in disbelief, letting out a short laugh.
Nero: ‚ÄúLol‚Ä¶ why, what? He didn‚Äôt say he needs our help! Didn‚Äôt even say a word! And why should we follow him? After this, he‚Äôs gonna get crowned officially the prince of Dajdovnik, right?‚Äù

Mathilda‚Äôs worry sharpens into urgency.
Mathilda: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand, Nero! It‚Äôs more than this! He‚Äôs waited for this moment his whole life. The Play‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs dangerous. We can‚Äôt leave him alone.‚Äù

Nero: ‚ÄúTHEN EXPLAIN TO ME!‚Äù

He shouts, hitting the counter with his open hand, looking away from her‚Äîbarely containing his rage. The princess looks at him silently as Nero slowly calms down.

Nero: ‚ÄúLook, you two are my best friends and now‚Ä¶ now he left for his crowning without saying a word or goodbye, and now you‚Äôre saying this ‚ÄòGrand Play‚Äô is dangerous and we should go after him urgently with no explanation from either of you. It‚Äôs like our friendship doesn‚Äôt mean anything to you‚Äîit‚Äôs a secret and I should just blindly follow.‚Äù

Mathilda: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right to be angry! 
(She makes a gesture with her hand,the guards behind her begin to escort everyone out of the premise .As soon as the place is emptied besides them bought-she  continues)Okay‚Ä¶  the Grand Play is a ritual every future king of Dajdovnik must participate in upon his return. When he‚Äôs called back to the city, he‚Äôs transported in the White Carriage‚Äîthe car you saw. It‚Äôs a type of hunt, different for every generation, tied to the stars of the strange sky above Dajdovnik.‚Äù

Nero: ‚ÄúHe hunts a deer or some strange beast with his royal party and what?‚Äù

Mathilda: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not beasts they hunt. Dajdovnik is a place of many abominations, far scarier than what our sky spawns‚Äîand some are of their own making. Those are what they hunt in the ritual. Imagine hide-and-seek with these creatures, but instead of finding someone‚Äîit‚Äôs two-sided. You look for them as they search for you, trying to kill each other.‚Äù

Nero‚Äôs face shows a mix of shock and disbelief.
Nero: ‚ÄúLol!?!? They‚Äôre willing to endanger their future ruler,there citizens , there own city? I‚Äôve heard of ritual hunts, but nothing like this! ‚Äù

Mathilda: ‚ÄúIt's viewed as a spectacle, a rite of passage, a  tests  ‚Ä¶ from what I‚Äôve heard.‚Äù

Nero: ‚ÄúI know Dajdovnik and their beliefs are strange, but why did he never tell me what it was really about? Or leave without saying a word?‚Äù

Mathilda: ‚ÄúHe never told me either! All i just told you whas shared to me by my father . I don‚Äôt know why Lazar hid it,  I just never asked. I‚Äôm not sure why he left without saying a word‚Äîmaybe it‚Äôs the shock of finally facing the moment he‚Äôs waited for all his life, maybe something else‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, Nero! We can ask him when we meet him. I hoped Lazar would notify us so we could offer help, but he didn‚Äôt. That doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt follow him. He‚Äôs our friend. We have time to be angry later.‚Äù

Her face hardens with determination as Nero looks down at his coffee and half-burned cigarette.

Nero: ‚ÄúThis asshole‚Ä¶‚Äù

(He stubs out his cigarette in the ashtray.)
Nero: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna kick his ass so bad when I meet him!‚Äù

He stands, looking at Mathilda.
Nero: ‚ÄúGet a weapon, Princess! We‚Äôre going to the big city.‚Äù

- Butler, fresh from his acclaimed Elvis biopic, and Kravitz, known for Mad Max and a recent Catwoman role, discussed quirky questions such as coffee mugs versus glasses, separate beds for couples, and whether the ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù song needs new lyrics.
- Both guests frequently sided with callers, which led the discussion into unexpected tangents like Pitbull concerts.
- Social‚Äëmedia reaction highlighted the pair‚Äôs chemistry, noting Butler‚Äôs earnestness and Kravitz‚Äôs quick wit.
- The segment illustrates the growing trend toward interactive, audience‚Äëdriven media that blurs the line between celebrity interview and participatory content.

Why it matters: It shows younger Hollywood talent engaging directly with fans, making celebrity interviews feel more relatable.

Yesterday i was in school
I got my period which was totally unexpected.
I had bad cramps to the point i can't even walk.
I put my head on the desk to take a nap
And i got awake when it was my class teacher's period. She asked me did i took the printout of the pdf she put on WhatsApp. I said i didn't.
I know it's my fault. I always take whatever she put into the group chat and it's my first time didn't took a copy.
She asked me why im napping 
I said im having a headache (i lied because i didn't want to announce my whole period to the class)
She asked me the reason why im having a headache. I said i don't know. Then she said maybe i got a headache because i found out my English marks. To give you context why she said that, because im a struggling student in the class.
I have C's and S's on my subjects. She always find a way to mock students who get lower grades.
I had a B in english she don't know about it.
She then said do i want to go to the sick room.
I hesitantly said yes.

I said no,

But she wasn't yelles at by her. I know because she is a topper.
I pretend to take a nap and silently cried my eyes out.I hate being a burden, I hate being this pathetic and getting humiliated.

The game has stuck with me ever since. It was a browser game. The concept was quite simple, you just went through your day, performing simple tasks. But, as the days go on, it gets weirder. I can list the few tasks i remember here:

You had to spam z to wake up and go to sleep. then you had to brush your teeth. Next you had to drink coffee, i remember this vividly because over the next few days spiders would start appearing in the coffee. Then you have to say hi to your neighbour, in this mini game you had to type out a sentence that was written at the bottom of the screen, i remember quite well that on the last day the neighbour gets eaten by an ostrich and the sky is red. From the little i remember i also think that on the last day your house is enveloped in tentacles.

Now for the style of the game, the game was a 2d pixelated game from the perspective of the protagonist, there is no walking involved, just simple tasks that, when finished. Will cut you to another scene, the game doesn‚Äôt take very long to complete.

I‚Äôve looked into it extensively myself but for the life of me i can‚Äôt find it. I already know it‚Äôs not everyday the same dream. I have no idea why I‚Äôve remembered this game for so long but i really want to find it again.",2,1756467218.0,tipofmyjoystick,3,1.0,False

I see the same people, do the same things, and haven't really had the chance to meet someone new beyond work. That's why I'm giving this a shot.

I love reading and writing poems (nothing published, just little spells of emotion I keep to myself), and yes, l'm a proud Harry Potter fan. Probably a Ravenclaw... but I won't mind a Gryffindor who knows how to listen, or a Slytherin with a soft side. üíôüíö‚ô•Ô∏èüíõ

I'm here looking for something real, slow, intentional conversations, maybe some laughs over Butterbeer (or coffee), and just someone who sees the beauty in little things.

1n34vsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideBereavement/comments/1n34vsp/suddenly_everything_is_different/,"Suddenly, everything is different.","I wake up in the morning, my heart racing. The blanket is slightly damp. I‚Äôm sweating. Panic spreads through me. I grab my phone with a sudden movement, tap the screen a few times. Nothing. No message from you. No call. My heart beats even faster. I notice the rushing in my ears. Then suddenly, silence. And it hits me. The certainty that this isn‚Äôt just a nightmare. You‚Äôre gone.

And yet, it still feels surreal. Less than two weeks ago, you were still here. In my head I replay our last moments together: my smartwatch wakes me in silence. I slide over to your side of the bed and stretch my arm above your head. Half-asleep, you sense it and roll over. You press yourself tightly against me. My arm, once stretched out, wraps around you now, so you can feel me and feel safe. We stay like that for a while. That moment was always the best part of my day. After ten minutes, your alarm rings. Just five more minutes. ‚ÄúWe should probably get up,‚Äù I finally say. I roll onto my side with you in my arms, so you‚Äôre beneath me, and I kiss you a few times. You smile at me. Carefully, I pull my arm out from under your head. After quickly checking the weather, I get up. Somehow I feel more tired than usual. I‚Äôm running a bit late. When I walk into the kitchen, you‚Äôre already there. You‚Äôre eating avocado toast. Like every morning. ‚ÄúJust so you know, for your time management‚Äîit‚Äôs already eight past,‚Äù you tell me. I glance at the oven clock. You‚Äôre right. I pour my coffee into my thermos mug and reply: ‚ÄúTrue, I‚Äôll give you a kiss now already. If I still have to pack my stuff, it‚Äôll be too hectic.‚Äù I turn to you and kiss you. Looking back, I can‚Äôt quite remember what that last tenderness we ever shared really felt like. I grab my things, call out ‚ÄúBye, see you tonight,‚Äù and I‚Äôm gone.

The workday drags on. In the morning there‚Äôs this meeting, the reason I had to go into the office in the first place. At 11:30 I wonder: ‚ÄúMaybe I should just head home? No real reason to stay here.‚Äù I shake off the thought. Since Covid, my boss keeps telling me I spend too much time working from home. The day passes. At 4:00 p.m., I look at the clock. I think: ‚ÄúYou could leave now, catch the train, and go outside with N. for a bit.‚Äù I pack my stuff. Then a coworker catches me. We start chatting. Damn, I miss my train. Okay, but by 5:00 I‚Äôm definitely leaving.

5:00 p.m. my phone is buzzing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna lie down for a bit :) Can‚Äôt wait to see you later ‚ù§Ô∏è.‚Äù I see your message. But I swipe it away again. I figure I‚Äôll be home soon anyway, so I play a video game instead. Back then, I had no idea what that message really meant.

6:45 p.m. I rush off the train, not realizing I‚Äôd already reached my stop. I hurry home, thinking about what we could do tonight. You haven‚Äôt been doing so well these past few weeks. I don‚Äôt want to overwhelm you. Maybe just a walk by the lake.

I get home. I see you lying on the bed, your head turned away. Something feels off. Your feet look different. A bad feeling creeps up in me. I focus on your chest to see your breathing. As I always do when you are sleeping. But I don‚Äôt see it. Scared, I walk around the bed. Slowly your face, turned away, comes into view. And then I see it. Time stands still. It hits me. Unexpected. Merciless. Suddenly, everything is different.

12 Years After Arrival
May 2nd, Moscow, United Earth.
Twelve years had passed. The twelfth anniversary of the Swarm's arrival was celebrated worldwide as Unity Day, but the main festivities were held in Moscow. On the honorary tribune in Red Square, leaders who just a dozen years ago had been geopolitical rivals stood side by side. Presidents, prime ministers, chancellors‚Äîall the inhabitants of Earth who were left with symbolic authority over their nations, while the real reins of power were held by the UN Council and the Guard's command.
Anya Sharma, the Secretary-General, stood in their midst, feeling the cool spring wind on her face. But no one was looking at the politicians. All eyes, from those on the tribune, to those in the crowd filling the square, to the billions in front of screens around the world, were turned to the sky.
And in the sky, the fleet was sailing.
This was not the silent, ominous flyover of alien ships from years ago. This was a show of force. Loud, proud, and undeniable. Twenty-four ""Hammer"" class destroyers, gleaming in the sun like arrowheads, flew in a perfect, tight formation. They didn't roar like jet fighters. They moved with an unnatural grace, emitting only a low, chest-vibrating hum from their Higgs engines. They flew low, just a thousand meters above the colorful domes of the Kremlin, and their shadows swept across the crowd like the hands of giants.
""God, what a sight..."" Anya whispered, her voice a mixture of awe and fear.
The whole world cheered. From Tokyo to Buenos Aires, from Cape Town to Oslo, people poured into the streets to watch the broadcast. These were their ships. Their achievements. A symbol of what the human species could do when united in the face of a common goal. Pride swelled in the hearts of millions.
Sergeant Lena Kowalska watched the television screen on the metal wall, sipping her coffee, admiring the parade of destroyers over the Kremlin. She built similar ones. She smiled, though deep down she was not happy with her new assignment. She had completed and passed her fusion reactor training with the highest possible score. She had been urgently transferred to the Gagarin shipyard to replace a lieutenant who had an accident in which he lost his leg; there had been similar cases before, and the nanites needed about 2 months to regenerate it. She was to supervise the installation of the reactor along with other technicians and specialists from every corner of the Earth. The shipyard bearing Gagarin's name had not let her go, even though relations between Poles and Russians had been tense since the wars of 2053. She wanted to return to the Kopernik; she wrote requests and letters to her superiors, citing that part of her family had died in that war and that this created personal problems in her work with the Russians. But command refused her every time, replying with a simple sentence: ""Request denied. We are all in the Seven Worlds Defense Guard. Problems of a national and ethnic nature are not taken into account in the evaluation of a staff position."" Her direct superior, Lieutenant Commander Kovalenko, understood her completely. He himself came from Ukraine; his parents were children when the war of 2022 broke out, and his grandfather had died during it, just like hundreds of thousands of others. He supported her when she wrote her requests and official letters, signing his approval for her departure every time, but he could do nothing more. The higher command of the Gagarin shipyard was adamant; they could not afford to lose such a brilliant technician, thanks to whom the fusion reactor assembly schedules were completed ahead of time and without issues.
She turned away from the screen and gave an order to a junior technician. ""How's the temperature reading, Valeriy?"" He replied, ""Lena, everything's okay, we're not going to fall."" She glanced at the brass plate mounted on the reactor casing with the inscription ""Ivan's Heart.""
And then it appeared. The Guard's first cruiser, produced in a record time of two years. It was enormous, twice the size of the destroyers, which looked like its escort. Its silhouette was brutal, angular, designed for maximum firepower, not elegance. On its gray, armored hull, a proud, white name was written in Cyrillic: ""Ivan Grozny"" (Ivan the Terrible).
A name reflecting the character of most of its builders‚ÄîRussian engineers and technicians from the ""Gagarin"" orbital shipyard, suspended in geostationary orbit over Siberia.
Admiral Marcus Thorne, standing next to Anya, watched the fleet's flyover not with pride, but with a cool, analytical satisfaction. Each ship was to him a collection of data, a test, an equation that had proven correct.
As the massive hull of the ""Ivan Grozny"" briefly eclipsed the sun, he sighed softly. ""We've mastered it,"" he muttered, more to himself than to Anya. ""We've mastered the technology of atmospheric flight with large vessels.""
Anya looked at him quizzically.
""Anti-gravity generators, my brother Aris's new toy, combined with local manipulation of the Higgs field,"" he explained briefly. ""We can make a twenty-thousand-ton cruiser as light as a feather. This changes everything. It means we can build them on the surface of planets. In gigantic, ground-based factories. Faster. Cheaper. And more of them.""
Anya Sharma understood. This parade was not just a display of what they had already built. It was a test by Marcus and Aris, and a promise of what they intended to build next. A fleet so vast that today's would look like a small, honorary escort in comparison.
Admiral Marcus Thorne watched as the last destroyer left the space above the square. His mission was to build a shield. But looking at these powerful, heavily armed silhouettes, he couldn't resist the thought that what they were creating much more closely resembled a sword. The biggest sword in their known part of the galaxy.

I‚Äôm a first time electric coffee grinder buyer, who would like the versatility of both espresso and filter coffee possibility in one grinder. I also love light roast coffee. I know ‚Ç¨400 isn‚Äôt much for a good grinder, but it‚Äôs a lot for me and I want to buy something that is as future proof as far as possible within reason.

My issue is that the same machines are recommended time and time again within this price range, and from what I can tell none of them quite have the versatility/value of the DF64 gen 2.
Maybe the niche zero comes close? But also seems to be getting increasingly outdated for its price point, and I‚Äôve heard it doesn‚Äôt do light roast that well.

The main thing holding me back from purchasing a DF64gen 2 is the fact I find it really quite ugly.  Aesthetics are somewhat important to me, especially if investing in a long term appliance and especially if it‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôm going to look at each morning.


So is there a less ugly equivalent, even if in a slightly higher price bracket? If not then I‚Äôll seriously consider purchasing this industrial, microscope-esque eyesore.

Sound familiar?

Three months ago, I was scrolling through productivity content at 2AM (ironic, I know) when I stumbled across the whole ""5AM club"" thing. My first thought? ""These people are insane.""

But I was desperate. I felt like I was always behind, always stressed, never had time for myself. So I said screw it let's try this for 30 days.

Here's what actually happened:

Week 1: Pure hell. I'm not gonna lie. I wanted to quit every single morning. My body was in retaliating. But I stuck with it because I'm stubborn.

Week 2-3: Something shifted. I started looking forward to those quiet hours. No notifications. No chaos. Just me and my notes. It felt like I had peace for the first time in my life.

Week 4+: Life changer. I suddenly had 2-3 extra hours every day. I started reading again. Working out. Actually eating breakfast instead of grabbing whatever.

When you win the morning, you feel like you can win the day. That confidence carries over into everything else. I became the person who gets shit done instead of the person who talks about getting shit done.

Three things that made it stick:

1. Go to bed earlier (revolutionary, I know). If you're staying up till midnight, 5AM won't work.
2. Have something to look forward to. For me, it was that perfect cup of coffee and 30 minutes of reading. Find your thing.
3. Start gradually. Don't go from 8AM to 5AM overnight. Move it back 15 minutes every few days.

I'm not saying you need to become a 5AM person. But if you're feeling stuck and want those extra hours back in your life give it a shot for just one week.

It helped me become more productive and disciplined.

1n34pfc,https://i.redd.it/at7sk45zyxlf1.jpeg,Update from 505 Coffee ‚òï ‚Äî Our 2nd Outlet is Here!,"Hey everyone, It‚Äôs been a year since my last post here, when we had just opened our first 505 Coffee outlet at Fort. A lot has happened since then ‚Äî and I wanted to share a quick update, and some real takeaways.¬†

We‚Äôve now officially launched our **second outlet** ‚Äî a brand-new kiosk right inside the lobby of **Times Square, Andheri**. We‚Äôre the only F&B kiosk in the building, and it's a great footfall-heavy corporate location ‚Äî exactly the kind of place we built this brand for.¬†

**About Us**¬†

We run small takeaway shops/kiosks in commercial hubs ‚Äî good coffee, great prices, and no pretense. Our goal from day one was to **de-premiumize good coffee**, make it accessible for everyday working people, and still keep the quality high.¬†

We have a full espresso menu, cold brews, matcha, seasonal specials, and a small but growing bakery lineup. It‚Äôs a compact format, designed for repeat daily customers.¬†

**The First few months,**

it just feels great seeing people buy and enjoy your coffee. Then of course it becomes more of business, but seeing regular guests outside your shop always feels good.¬†

We were lucky to get a great spot for our first store in, right opposite a Blue Tokai. We managed to shift a lot of their pickup traffic over to us (no kidding ‚Äî one of their senior team members even visited and tried to poach our barista haha).¬†

**Bestsellers & Menu Moves**¬†

* Our early bestsellers: **Vietnamese Iced Coffee** and Spanish Latte¬†

* In Dec, we felt we‚Äôd hit a bit of a ceiling, so we expanded the food menu ‚Üí Introduced **Avocado Feta, Jalape√±o Cheese**, and other **Croissant Sandwiches** ‚Äî this instantly bumped up our AOV¬†

* In April, we added **Matcha** ‚Äî and it blew up. It's not a fad guys. people have it regularly like replacing coffee. Maybe a fad for those who have it once for a insta story or something, but why would you have it daily. they love it.¬†

¬†‚Üí Bestsellers: **Iced Vanilla Matcha Latte & Strawberry Matcha**¬†

Since were one shop, we keep trying new items and experiment with our menu and have guests taste stuff. ¬†Even though this is a serious business, it doesn‚Äôt mean your coffee shop can‚Äôt feel personal and playful.¬†

**Business Realities & Lessons Learned**¬†

**Location is everything!**  We lucked out with this one and sales began day one! Us being there often for the first few months and interacting with customers helped build loyalty and connect.¬†

**Swiggy & Zomato commissions hurt** \- At first we kept the prices the same but later had to increase the coffee prices a little to not make a loss on every online order. Were happy majority of our sales are still direct. Zomato better than swiggy for commissions.¬†

**Beans & Roasting** \- We had to switch our coffee bean suppliers in February because they had to increase their prices. it was a smooth transition to another amazing roaster and customers did not even notice the change, nor did we!¬†

¬†**Promotions** ‚Äì The 505 Loyalty Card We launched with a cool loyalty scheme ‚Äî stamp card where your 5th coffee was 50% off and 10th free. It was amazing. people were getting a free coffee in 2 weeks. the everyday drinkers. But we ended up stopping it in 6 months cause too many discounts not sustainable. we might start it again lets see.¬†

**Licenses & Permissions** are a big issue and unreasonably complicated. The BMC makes it hard for genuine people.¬†

**Real Estate Struggles** \- finding good new locations is HARD. We lost 2 excellent spots in Lower Parel, one because another coffee brand objected to our presence (yes, that happens). There's too much competition in retail spaces and if your a new brand the rent ask is too high!

**What‚Äôs Next**¬†

Our Times Square, Andheri kiosk goes¬†live next week. It's a beautiful lobby with constant movement ‚Äî we‚Äôre excited to see how it performs.¬†

We‚Äôll continue to open a few more outlets this year. Testing new menu items. Keeping it personal. And staying grounded in the everyday customer‚Äôs experience.¬†

I‚Äôve been testing out the Gain 30772117699 Liquid Laundry Detergent for a while now and, truthfully, it‚Äôs made my laundry experience unexpectedly enjoyable. If you haven‚Äôt considered your laundry detergent as a mood setter before, this one just might change your mind. The ""Relax"" scent blend is the star, transforming my laundry routine into a surprisingly calming ritual. With every wash, it‚Äôs as if my clothes are telling me they‚Äôve been on a relaxing spa day. While I‚Äôve used quite a few detergents over the years, this one quickly stood out.  

**Design and Packaging**  

The moment I lifted this container, its practical yet user-friendly packaging made a good impression. Gain clearly thought through the ergonomics here, making the bottle easy to handle despite its large size (154 fl oz to be exact). Although it weighs a solid 10.66 pounds, the sturdy design ensures you won‚Äôt struggle while pouring; the spout minimizes mess, which is a relief considering how many times I‚Äôve had detergents spill all over my laundry room shelves in the past. 

[Check Gain 30772117699 Liquid Laundry Detergent price on Amazon.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b0cqkrs1h4/)  

**Performance and Washing Results**  

The cleaning power is, without a doubt, top-notch. I tested it across all kinds of fabrics, from delicates to heavy-duty denim. This detergent left no room for disappointment. Stubborn coffee stains disappeared from my favorite white shirt after just one cycle‚Äîwhich, might I add, has been rare with other detergents. The claim that it works in all washing machines and water conditions held true during my test in both an HE washer and a standard one. The detergent didn't leave any residue, which is a huge win since I have absolutely no patience for doing a second rinse.  

**Relax Scent Experience**  

The ""Relax"" scent is what really hooked me. It doesn‚Äôt dominate your senses but instead gently lingers on clothes, emitting a subtle, fresh aroma that elevates your mood. I caught myself sniffing one of my freshly-washed gym hoodies during the day, which I‚Äôve never done before. It doesn‚Äôt just smell clean‚Äîit smells like a breezy day in a tranquil meadow. Surprisingly, the scent doesn‚Äôt fade quickly, so even folded clothes tucked away in my drawer for weeks still carry that fresh vibe.  

**Highlights**  

- The premium ""Relax"" scent adds a calming touch to each load.  
- Works on tough stains effortlessly, including stubborn food and drink spills.  
- Compatible with all washing machine types and water temperatures.  

**Shortcomings**  

As much as I‚Äôve enjoyed using this detergent, there are a couple of things you should know.  

- The large size can make it slightly inconvenient to store in smaller spaces.  
- While the lingering scent is pleasant, it might not appeal to those who prefer scent-free cleaning products.  
- It doesn‚Äôt include a measuring cup, so I had to eyeball the amount for initial loads until I got a sense of how much was needed.  

**Competing Products**  

When compared to Tide‚Äôs premium detergents, I found the Gain Relax option to be less harsh on certain fabrics. While Tide is great at tackling ultra-tough stains, Gain delivered similar results but with a more balanced gentleness that didn‚Äôt wear out fabrics as quickly. Against Arm & Hammer‚Äôs liquid detergents, Gain wins hands down for fragrance. Arm & Hammer may be a go-to for people looking purely for utility, but it doesn‚Äôt provide the same sensory experience that Gain offers. However, for those wanting an all-natural detergent, products like Seventh Generation offer an eco-friendly edge that Gain won‚Äôt claim to match.  

**Money's Worth**  

Looking at the size and features of this detergent, it offers great value for what you‚Äôre getting. While it might sit slightly on the mid-to-premium pricing spectrum, its performance justifies every penny. You‚Äôd typically have to combine a stain remover and a fragrance spray to achieve similar results with some other detergents. Gain does it all in one go‚Äîsaving you both time and additional purchases. The fact that it works as a vibe-lifter just adds to its worth; not many products can promise an emotional boost while doing chores.

Pack *everything* the night before: Kinda goes without saying, but clothes, passport, phone ... get everything ready for the early morning. I get my 'airport' outfit ready too (something comfy, with layers). I don't want to be searching for socks at 3am. I also screenshot everything beforehand e.g. terminal info, hotel info, boarding pass, just in case your phone or WiFi doesn't play ball later.   
2. Stay in an airport hotel: I personally love avoiding the early drive to the airport by sleeping at the airport the night before.  
3. Bring your own breakfast: Not all cafes open early, so bring a croissant, snack, whatever you fancy to get you through boarding (a cup of coffee before I step out the door also helps). I like to drink plenty of water the night before and bring an empty bottle to refill after security too.  
4. Set two alarms, three if you have to: I've learnt not to rely on just one phone alarm. Add one to your partner's phone, have one in the room... Or at least check your phone has the sound on and is fully charged. Don't accidentally miss your flight through sleeping in!  
5. Actually. Go. To. Sleep: Sounds obvious, but try your best to get in as much sleep as possible. Don't fall into the trap of 'powering through', trying to stay awake until you set off, then feeling delirious and regretting your life choices.

We wanted to go deeper - **to build scheduling AI-native**. Here‚Äôs what that looks like under the hood.

*How Ting Works*

* **Gemini AI (Google‚Äôs LLM)** ‚Üí This isn‚Äôt just autocomplete. Gemini parses messy, human language in emails (‚Äúlet‚Äôs do next week, maybe late afternoon?‚Äù) and resolves it into actionable time slots.
* **LangChain orchestration** ‚Üí We use LangChain as the reasoning + action layer: connecting the LLM to calendars, preferences, and email. It doesn‚Äôt just suggest; it books, reschedules, cancels.
* **Email-native design** ‚Üí We didn‚Äôt build another dashboard. Ting lives in email because that‚Äôs where scheduling actually happens. You CC it into a thread ‚Üí it runs the whole loop automatically.

*How Ting Keeps Your Data Safe*

A lot of AI products grab *all* your data. Ting takes the opposite route:

* Minimum access required (just what‚Äôs needed to schedule).
* No ads, no resale.
* Enforced by **Google API Services User Data Policy** \+ OAuth 2.0 + TLS encryption.
* Your private data isn‚Äôt used to train our models.

*Why AI Changes Scheduling*

Legacy schedulers are static. You send a link, the other person does the work, and when life happens (it always does), the rescheduling circus begins.

With LLMs, scheduling finally becomes adaptive:

* Ting understands intent in natural language.
* Negotiates back-and-forth without leaving the email thread.
* Learns *your* rhythms over time (preferred days, tones, contacts).

*What‚Äôs Next for Us*

* Getting smarter every time you use it (personalized memory, not just generic AI).
* Pulling more context (like your inbox flow) to recommend better times.
* Exploring **emotionally intelligent scheduling** \- because ‚Äúlet‚Äôs grab coffee‚Äù is not the same as ‚Äúurgent investor call.‚Äù

When i would return from school, my neighbourhood would feel unfamiliar and i would often feel as if i was ""snatched"" from a decade ago and forcefully placed in present times, which often felt like a fever dream and my old selves would feel like different people. I still experience derealization + depersonalization nowadays, i would feel disconnected from my feelings, surroundings, memories and sometimes dissociating would make it difficult for me to move my body, i would feel stiff and my coordination would suffer greatly. Other times i would feel as if watching myself do something, as if placed in the passenger's seat. I don't feel like ""multiple people"" but rather my sense of self is blurry and my views of things not are not truly solid. I do experience ""parts"" (since i was 8/9?

1n34iey,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeAdmissionGuide/comments/1n34iey/top_10_tips_to_write_an_a_assignment_without/,Top 10 Tips to Write an A+ Assignment Without Stress,"Writing assignments is something every student has to do, but it doesn‚Äôt always have to be painful or stressful. Many students feel overwhelmed when they see the deadline coming closer, but with the right approach, you can make the process smoother and even enjoyable. Below are 10 practical tips to help you write an A+ assignment without losing your peace of mind.

**1. Understand the Question Properly**

The very first step is reading the question carefully. Don‚Äôt rush. Many students lose marks simply because they misunderstood what the teacher was asking. Highlight keywords like *discuss, compare, analyze,* or *explain*. These words guide you on how to structure your answer. If you are unsure, ask your teacher for clarification before you begin.

**2. Plan Before You Start Writing**

Jumping into writing without a plan often leads to confusion later. Take a few minutes to jot down your ideas, create a rough outline, and decide on the main points you want to cover. Planning saves time in the long run and keeps your writing focused.

**3. Do Proper Research**

Good assignments need strong information. Use your textbooks, lecture notes, online academic sources, and library resources. Don‚Äôt just copy from one website‚Äîcheck different references to make sure your information is reliable. And always keep track of your sources, because you‚Äôll need them for referencing.

**4. Manage Your Time Wisely**

Procrastination is one of the biggest reasons for stress. Instead of waiting until the night before, break the assignment into smaller tasks. For example, Day 1 for research, Day 2 for outlining, Day 3 for writing, and Day 4 for editing. This way, you‚Äôre not rushing and you‚Äôll have time to polish your work.

**5. Keep Your Language Clear and Simple**

Teachers prefer assignments that are easy to read and understand. Avoid using complicated words just to sound smart. Write in a clear, straightforward manner. Short sentences often work better than very long ones. Remember, your goal is to show your understanding, not to confuse the reader.

**6. Follow the Correct Structure**

Most assignments follow a simple structure: **introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.** In the introduction, briefly explain what the assignment is about. The body paragraphs should explain your points with evidence, and the conclusion should wrap everything up clearly. A well-structured assignment looks professional and is easier to follow.

**7. Don‚Äôt Forget Referencing**

Many students lose marks because they skip proper referencing. Always cite your sources in the style required by your school or university (APA, MLA, Harvard, etc.). Referencing not only gives credit to the original authors but also shows your teacher that you have done genuine research.

**8. Edit and Proofread Carefully**

Never submit your assignment immediately after finishing it. Take a break, then read it again. Look for spelling errors, grammar mistakes, or sentences that don‚Äôt make sense. Reading aloud can also help you catch mistakes you might miss while reading silently. If possible, ask a friend to quickly review your work.

**9. Stay Organized While Working**

Keep all your notes, references, and drafts in one place. If you‚Äôre working on a computer, save your work regularly and back it up. Nothing is more stressful than losing hours of writing because of a technical issue. Staying organized will also help you find information faster when you need it.

**10. Take Care of Yourself**

Lastly, don‚Äôt forget about your health. Pulling all-nighters and drinking endless coffee may seem like the only way to finish on time, but it usually makes you tired and less productive. Instead, get enough sleep, eat proper meals, and take short breaks while writing. A fresh mind always writes better than an exhausted one.

# Final Thoughts

Writing an A+ assignment doesn‚Äôt mean you have to stress yourself out. With the right planning, research, structure, and self-care, you can complete your work with confidence.

I'm hoping to get some help with a very stubborn Mr. Coffee Caf√© Barista (model BVMC-ECMP1000). I got it used and it's been a long journey.

**The Main Problem Now:** I'm trying to open the main housing/case to get to the internals (pump and thermoblock), but it seems impossible to remove.

**What I've done so far:**
1.  I've removed the two screws on the upper back of the machine.
2.  I've thoroughly checked for any other screws, especially in the water tank compartment and under the rubber feet at the bottom. There are absolutely no other visible screws.
3.  This leads me to believe the entire housing is held together by strong internal plastic clips.

**The Issue:** These clips are incredibly tight. I've tried using plastic cards and pry tools to gently separate the casing along the seams, but it feels like it's going to break before it opens. I'm applying firm but gentle pressure, trying to twist the cards to release the clips, but nothing is giving way.

**My question is:** Has anyone here successfully disassembled this specific model? Is there a secret screw I'm missing, or a specific technique/spot to pry from to get these clips to release without breaking the plastic?

Any advice, pictures, or guidance would be hugely appreciated. I'm so close to getting this machine working and this is the last major hurdle.

__________________________________

**2024-02-13 Tuesday [Evening 07:36 PM]**

**(Mikasa‚Äôs POV)**

The February wind stung my skin as I walked. Above me, the night sky sparkled with stars. It looked calm and beautiful, completely opposite to the storm brewing in my chest.

My hands wouldn‚Äôt stay still, so I squeezed the strap of my bag to steady them. No matter how much I told myself to breathe, one thought kept circling: *What am I going to tell Eren?*

I realized I was walking too quickly, almost rushing. I wasn‚Äôt late‚Äîthough I was a few minutes behind‚Äîbut I wanted to get this over with before I lost my nerve.

Across the street, the caf√© appeared. Its golden lights spilled onto the pavement, glowing like a safe haven in the cold. My heartbeat raced as I pushed the door open.

The hum of voices, the smell of coffee, the soft music blurred the moment my eyes landed on him.

Eren.

He sat near the window, his head slightly bent over his phone. His brows were furrowed, as if he was wondering where I was. The sight tightened my chest.

I walked toward him, each step feeling heavier. **‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶ Eren,‚Äù** I said quietly when I reached him.

He looked up immediately, his expression softening. **‚ÄúThere you are. I thought you might not come.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I was a little late,‚Äù** I admitted, looking down.

**‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù** he replied simply and motioned for me to sit.

I took a seat across from him. It felt strange facing him like this. For a moment, I couldn‚Äôt think of anything to say.

Eren, as always, broke the silence first. **‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ how‚Äôs college been?‚Äù**

I fiddled with the edge of my sleeve. **‚ÄúThe same as always. Nothing new.‚Äù**

He nodded slowly, then leaned back in his chair. **‚ÄúAnd Armin and Annie? I heard about them. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ kind of nice, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù** I said softly, a small smile escaping despite my nerves. **‚ÄúThey suit each other.‚Äù**

The words I wanted to say crowded my throat, but they wouldn‚Äôt come out. I opened my mouth‚Äî

**‚ÄúGood evening. What would you like to order?‚Äù**

The waiter‚Äôs voice startled me. I quickly shut my mouth, heat rising to my cheeks. Eren ordered cappuccinos for both of us, and I asked for a slice of chocolate cake. After the waiter left, silence stretched between us again.

Eren spoke first. His eyes lingered on me, searching. **‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been‚Ä¶ different lately. Quieter. Is something bothering you?‚Äù**

His straightforward question caught me off guard. I looked away, my fingers tightening around my sleeve. **‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs wrong. I just‚Ä¶ wanted to talk to you.‚Äù**

I hesitated, then whispered, **‚ÄúDo you ever feel like‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs something you need to say, but no matter how hard you try, the words won‚Äôt come out?‚Äù**

Eren tilted his head slightly, thinking. **‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ not really. I usually just say what‚Äôs on my mind. But‚Ä¶ I guess sometimes it‚Äôs not that simple.‚Äù** His voice softened at the end, as if he wasn‚Äôt even sure about that.

The waiter returned with our drinks and cake, placing them on the table gently. I picked up the fork but barely touched the cake. My chest felt too heavy.

Finally, I said it‚Äîjust a little. **‚ÄúI want to tell you something, but‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how.‚Äù**

He leaned forward slightly, his gaze steady. **‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay. You don‚Äôt have to force it. Sometimes it‚Äôs easier to talk to a stranger than someone close.‚Äù**

My heart skipped a beat. *Those words‚Ä¶* They were the same thing Mr. Unknown once told me.

I looked at him sharply. For the first time, I noticed the green in his eyes under the warm caf√© light. They were deep and clear, like polished glass. The sight sent a strange warmth through me.

**‚ÄúEren,‚Äù** I said quietly, **‚Äúeven though we‚Äôve lived next to each other all these years, we‚Äôve barely talked. To be honest‚Ä¶ this feels like the first real conversation we‚Äôve ever had.‚Äù**

He gave me a small, almost shy smile. **‚ÄúYeah. I guess it does. But‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm glad. It feels like we‚Äôre finally starting to understand each other.‚Äù**

Before I could stop myself, I blurted out, **‚ÄúDo you‚Ä¶ date anyone?‚Äù**

The words hung awkwardly between us. My heart raced.

Eren blinked, then shook his head. **‚ÄúNo. I don‚Äôt.‚Äù**

I shouldn‚Äôt have felt relief. But I did. An odd, quiet happiness made my chest loosen.

We ate in silence after that. The air between us felt strangely comfortable. When we finally stood to leave, Eren stepped ahead and held the door open for me. The small gesture made my cheeks warm. Without thinking, I asked, **‚ÄúDo you‚Ä¶ want to walk home together?‚Äù**

He nodded. **‚ÄúSure.‚Äù**

The cold air wrapped around us as we walked side by side. Our hands brushed once by accident, and I quickly tucked mine into my coat pocket. But the warmth lingered.

Armin once told me: *When you walk with someone you love, it feels different. Like your heart finally rests.*

For some reason, I thought of those words now.

I stole a glance at Eren. He was smiling faintly at nothing in particular, looking content as the night surrounded him. The sight made something flutter inside me.

**‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù** I murmured, breaking the silence. **‚ÄúFor not saying what I wanted to say.‚Äù**

He glanced at me, his smile soft. **‚ÄúThat‚Äôs alright. If you‚Äôre not ready, then you‚Äôre not ready. When the time comes, you‚Äôll tell me.‚Äù**

His voice‚Äîgentle and steady‚Äîsounded just like Mr. Unknown again.

I smiled despite myself. He smiled back. Just like that, the heaviness in my chest eased.

By the time we reached our apartment building, my heart felt lighter than it had in weeks. We said goodnight, and I stepped into my room with an unshakable warmth inside me.

**(Time skip: Night 09:50 PM)**

I had just taken a quick shower and was lying on my couch, staring at the ceiling. My mind kept replaying everything that happened with Eren at the caf√©. The way he smiled, the way he held the door open for me; small things, but they felt different. Different in a way that stirred something inside me.

But with that came the sting of guilt. I still hadn‚Äôt told him. The weight I‚Äôd carried for years sat heavy in my chest, and tonight, once again, I failed to let it out.

As I was lost in thought, my phone buzzed.

It was him. **Mr. Unknown.** What timing.

**Mr. Unknown [09:51 PM]:** *Hey, girl. How‚Äôs your night going?*

**Me [09:52 PM]:** *‚Ä¶Hey. I was kind of expecting you to text. Glad you did.*

**Mr. Unknown [09:53 PM]:** *Oh? Expecting me, huh? That sounds like a good sign. But tell me‚Äîdid you meet him today?*

**Me [09:54 PM]:** *Yeah‚Ä¶ I did.*

**Mr. Unknown [09:55 PM]:** *And? Did you say what you needed to say?*

**Me [09:56 PM]:** *‚Ä¶No. I couldn‚Äôt. The words just wouldn‚Äôt come out. Maybe you were right‚ÄîI‚Äôm not ready yet.*

**Mr. Unknown [09:57 PM]:** *That‚Äôs okay. Really. Courage doesn‚Äôt come all at once. One day, when the moment feels right, it‚Äôll happen.*

I stared at his message for a long time. My chest tightened. Maybe this was the moment; not with Eren, but with him. The one person who felt safe to tell the truth.

**Me [09:59 PM]:** *Can I tell you something? Something I‚Äôve never told anyone before.*

**Mr. Unknown [10:00 PM]:** *‚Ä¶Of course. If you feel like you want to, I‚Äôll listen.*

**Me [10:01 PM]:** *Do you know Eren from my college?*

**Mr. Unknown [10:02 PM]:** *Yeah, I know who he is. Why?*

**Me [10:03 PM]:** *His parents‚Ä¶ they died in a car accident. But the part I‚Äôve never told anyone is‚Ä¶ it was my parents who were in the car that hit them. Both sides‚Ä¶ gone, just like that.*

My hands were shaking as I typed. I almost deleted it. But instead, I pressed send and held my breath.

**Mr. Unknown [10:05 PM]:** *‚Ä¶Mikasa. That‚Äôs heavy. But why do you feel like you have to tell him?**

**Me [10:06 PM]:** *Because I feel guilty. Every time I see him, every time he smiles, I remember. And I think‚Äîif he ever knew, he‚Äôd hate me. But if I keep it inside forever, I‚Äôll suffocate.*

**Mr. Unknown [10:07 PM]:** *Listen to me. That accident wasn‚Äôt your fault. You were just a kid. You didn‚Äôt cause it.*

**Me [10:08 PM]:** *Maybe not. But my heart doesn‚Äôt care about logic. It just keeps whispering: ‚ÄúTell him. He deserves to know.‚Äù And every time I try, I can‚Äôt breathe.*

**Mr. Unknown [10:09 PM]:** *Then don‚Äôt force it. When you‚Äôre ready‚Äîtruly ready‚Äîyou‚Äôll find the words. Until then‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt destroy yourself over it.*

My eyes stung. My chest felt lighter, like a door I kept locked finally cracked open.

**Me [10:10 PM]:** *‚Ä¶I actually feel a little lighter after saying it to you.*

**Mr. Unknown [10:11 PM]:** *Then maybe this is your first step. You don‚Äôt have to forgive yourself tonight. Just let yourself breathe.*

**Me [10:12 PM]:** *Thank you‚Ä¶ for listening. Really.*

**Mr. Unknown [10:13 PM]:** *I‚Äôll always listen.*

I stared at the screen, my fingers trembling. I didn‚Äôt know who he was. I didn‚Äôt even know if he wasn‚Äôt Eren himself. But right now, that didn‚Äôt matter. 

All I knew was my heart finally felt a little lighter than before.

The main left and right clicks are okay, but the scroll wheel has a definite tick-tick-tick and the side buttons still have that sharp, plasticky click that's loud enough to wake my partner. On top of that, the feet make a right scraping noise on our wooden coffee table in an otherwise silent room.

I've been looking at those vertical mice, and saw a review for a rechargeable one that uses a 2.4G dongle. The review said it was great for wrist pain and the main clicks were dead quiet. But that's the problem with a tablet, isn't it? Using a USB dongle is a pain if you also want to charge the thing, and I don't fancy carrying a separate hub around the house. Bluetooth is much tidier, but does anyone else find it feels a bit laggy in DeX?

For anyone who regularly uses a mouse with their Galaxy Tab, what's the quietest setup you've found? I'm talking properly silent, especially the scroll wheel. I've had a couple of the Logitech ""silent"" ones before and they're nearly there, but that wheel noise still does my head in.

Has anyone tried one of those vertical mice, like the Anker ones, over Bluetooth with a Tab? How's the lag, and do the side buttons work properly in Android apps and Chrome?

Beijing introduced an export control system of rare earths on April 4, in retaliation for Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòliberation day‚Äô tariffs on China on April 1. However, after the two rounds of talks (in¬†[Geneva¬†](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/05/joint-statement-on-u-s-china-economic-and-trade-meeting-in-geneva/)in May and¬†[London](https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202506/09/content_WS6846d68cc6d0868f4e8f32fc.html#:~:text=LONDON,%20June%209%20--%20The,the%20meeting%20with%20U.S.%20representatives.)¬†in June), China‚Äôs rare-earth magnet exports have risen significantly, surpassing levels not seen since April, when Beijing imposed export restrictions. The U.S. imports have seen a remarkable surge, with volumes increasing by 660 percent in June alone and another 76 percent in July. China dominates rare-earth magnet production, controlling about 90% of the global supply and refining the minerals used.

This article focuses on the American military weapons systems and their dependency on China‚Äôs rare earth minerals. United States-based Govini, a defense software company, published a report titled ‚Äú[From Rock to Rocket: Critical Minerals and the Trade War for National Security](https://www.govini.com/insights/from-rock-to-rocket-critical-minerals-and-the-trade-war-for-national-security)‚Äù on U.S. military dependence on China‚Äôs critical minerals. The report disclosed that America‚Äôs military dominance increasingly relies on China.

China‚Äôs¬†[dominance in rare earth minerals](https://www.ft.com/content/b8269eff-b60a-435f-8e85-43f9fa36f9c2)¬†(REEs) poses a direct national security threat to the U.S. defense weapons system. In response to President Trump‚Äôs ‚Äò[Liberation Day tariffs](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/regulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and-persistent-annual-united-states-goods-trade-deficits/)‚Äô on China, China‚Äôs Ministry of Commerce¬†[imposed export restrictions](http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/zcfb/zc/art/2025/art_a6ea0f03b9be475a9d06ee9d088d605d.html)¬†on seven REEs and magnets in the defense, energy, and automotive sectors. These minerals include samarium, gadolinium, thorium, dysprosium, ruthenium, scandium, and yttrium. Previously, China had¬†[imposed export controls on gallium and germanium](https://english.news.cn/20230706/7338e2974eee41fba9850bc39a700781/c.html)¬†in July 2023, tungsten and tellurium in¬†[February 2024](https://globaltradealert.org/state-act/88204), and bismuth, molybdenum, and indium in August 2024.

[The report unveiled](https://www.govini.com/insights/from-rock-to-rocket-critical-minerals-and-the-trade-war-for-national-security)¬†the vulnerability of the U.S. military-industrial complex to Chinese-controlled REEs, which poses a significant strategic risk for U.S. high-end weapons. For instance, the report stated that these minerals are present in a staggering 80,006 components across nearly 1,908 U.S. military weapons systems. It is said that these minerals comprise 77.7 percent of Department of Defense (DOD) platforms. The situation is particularly concerning for specific service branches. For instance, the U.S. Navy‚Äôs 739 weapons systems are impacted by 91.6 percent of these minerals, while the Marine Corps‚Äô 292 weapons systems are affected by 61.7 percent. Similarly, the Army‚Äôs 302 weapons systems are impacted by 70.03 percent, and the Air Force‚Äôs 302 weapons systems are affected by 85.1 percent of their systems.

**To understand the vulnerability, a recent**¬†[**report by CSIS**](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions)¬†**on the requirements of REEs for high-end military products unveiled the total requirements for its weapons production. For instance, the F-35 fighter jet incorporates over 900 pounds of rare earth elements (REEs). Similarly, the Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 destroyer needs roughly 5,200 pounds of REEs. A Virginia-class submarine uses around 9,200 pounds of rare earth elements. The production of these highly sophisticated military weapons would be vulnerable in the context of China‚Äôs export control of REEs.**

China‚Äôs recent export restrictions have had a profound impact on the market. In just three months, the¬†[average prices of components containing restricted minerals](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/04/chinas-rare-earth-mineral-squeeze-will-hit-pentagon-hard/404776/)¬†experienced a significant increase of 5.2 percent. Gallium rose by 6 percent, antimony by 4.5 percent, and germanium by 1.6 percent. Unlike restricted minerals, non-restricted materials only saw a modest 1.4 percent increase, underscoring the direct correlation between access restrictions and cost volatility.

China‚Äôs dominance in extractions and processing, including midstream stages, particularly refining and processing, multiplied the problem. Even when minerals are mined in U.S. allied countries, they are often sent to China for refinement since China owns more than 90% of refining capacity, making true independence elusive. For instance,¬†[China supplies 60% of the global antimony market](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025.pdf)¬†and processes nearly one-third of all refined material worldwide. Only 19% of the antimony used by the U.S. originates from sources outside Chinese influence. This systemic bottleneck exposes invisible dependencies that cannot be addressed solely by diversifying raw material sources.

China‚Äôs influence expands globally, with state-affiliated companies operating in Ghana, Russia, Tajikistan, the DRC, and Kazakhstan. This gives Beijing leverage over mineral flows, shaping market dynamics and potentially delaying or raising costs for resources not mined domestically. U.S. defense planners may mistakenly believe they source from neutral nations when critical supply chain stages remain under Chinese control. The U.S. must invest in domestic processing and refining infrastructure to mitigate this vulnerability. Over 35 crucial minerals extracted in the U.S. or allied nations are currently sent to China for processing, which is unsustainable.

The DOD has invested heavily in critical mineral production to support domestic refining capacity. For instance, in 2024, the¬†[National Defence Industrial Strategy](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/)¬†set a goal to develop a complete mine-to-magnet REE supply chain that can meet all U.S. defense needs by 2027. Since 2020, DOD has allocated $439 million towards building a domestic supply chain of REEs. In 2020,¬†[the Pentagon awarded MP Materials $9.6 million](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/release/article/2418542/dod-announces-rare-earth-element-awards-to-strengthen-domestic-industrial-base/)¬†for a light REE separation facility at Mountain Pass, California. In 2022,¬†[DOD invested $35 million](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2941793/dod-awards-35-million-to-mp-materials-to-build-us-heavy-rare-earth-separation-c/)¬†in a heavy REEs processing facility. These facilities are the first of their kind in the U.S. to fully integrate the REE supply chain from mining, separating, and refining.

In addition, in February 2024,¬†[DOD invested $59.4 million](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=59.4+million+to+Idaho+for+antimony+reserves&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)¬†in Idaho for antimony reserves, which are promising but need scaling. Positive momentum is evident in tellurium, where domestic sourcing increased from 5 percent to 25 percent due to U.S.-Canadian efforts and r[educed its foreign reliance](https://manufacturingutah.com/utahs-kennecott-mine-recovers-tellurium-for-green-products/)¬†from 95 percent in 2019 to 25 percent in 2023. However, minerals like gallium and germanium remain dependent on foreign processing. To address this, partnerships with trusted allies like Australia and Canada must be expanded and coordinated to ensure secure refining channels.

Many critical minerals are byproducts of commonly mined resources but are overlooked due to economic and regulatory barriers. Projects like¬†[Perpetua Resources¬†](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Perpetua+Resources+Receives+up+to+an+Additional+$34.6+Million+Under+the+Defense+Production+Act&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)received up to $59 million under the Defense Production Act to redevelop an abandoned mining site.¬†[Texas‚Äô Round Top deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-gallium-deposits-united-states)¬†offers a unique opportunity to access multiple critical minerals from a single site, which could be pivotal if federal investment is prioritized.

The report exposes future vulnerabilities in strategically essential minerals like magnesium (China controls 90 percent), graphite (China controls nearly 80 percent), and fluorspar (China accounts for 62 percent). These materials are crucial for aircraft, missiles, batteries, and advanced optics, yet the U.S. is unprepared for potential restrictions. China‚Äôs dominance in these sectors underscores the urgent need for a long-term strategic response.

To conclude, the military weapons systems of the United States rely heavily on Chinese-controlled rare earth minerals and magnets. The entire U.S. military‚Äôs weapons are exposed to Chinese critical minerals. Fighter jets, missiles, radar systems, and submarines of the U.S. weapons system are vulnerable to Chinese dominance in REEs. Securing access to antimony, gallium, germanium, tungsten, and tellurium is critical to ensuring long-term mineral independence and safeguarding U.S. defense capabilities.

# AUGUST 29th, 2025~ US-backed TechMet's new trading unit to boost ex-China critical mineral flows

*LONDON - US government-backed investment vehicle TechMet is launching a trading arm for critical minerals to specialize in the burgeoning market for Western supplies of materials in which China is dominant, its CEO said on Thursday.*

[US-backed TechMet's new trading unit to boost ex-China critical mineral flows](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/us-backed-techmets-new-trading-unit-to-boost-ex-china-critical-mineral-flows-2025-08-29)

https://reddit.com/link/1n348oq/video/3wa3cfpcjxlf1/player

The United States, Europe and many Asian nations are scrambling to boost domestic output of critical materials such as rare earths and cut dependence on China.

A new trading unit, TechMet SCM, will focus on speciality metals, from both its portfolio companies and third parties.

""We're aligned with the re-shoring of the supply chains towards the West and I think you can't have a better differentiator than having this U.S. DFC anchorage,"" said¬†**Quentin Lamarche**, CEO of the new trading unit.

The U.S. government's International Development Finance Corp is one of TechMet's biggest investors.

Asked if the new trading arm would do deals with U.S. agencies, Lamarche said the names of customers would be confidential, adding: ""It's not a hidden secret that we want to play a role, right? And an active role.""

A new employee is due to join TechMet SCM in the next few weeks in Washington DC, one of three locations for the trading arm, he said.

Lamarche is based in Brussels and the other office is in South Korea, which is important due to the battery sector there.

TechMet SCM is focusing on battery metals lithium, cobalt and nickel, but wants to expand to other critical minerals, possibly rare earths, Lamarche said.

Privately-held TechMet has stakes in 10 companies, including Brazilian Nickel, Cornish Lithium, Rainbow Rare Earths RBWR.L and Momentum Technologies, which developed a process to recycle EV batteries and rare earth permanent magnets.

Previously, TechMet had a trading joint venture with one of its biggest shareholders, commodity trading house Mercuria, but the new structure where the trading arm is wholly owned by TechMet will be more flexible, Lamarche said.

""Mercuria remains a shareholder in TechMet and we will still do¬†[operations](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/operations)¬†with them, but we'll be more agile going forward.""

Lamarche previously worked for Specialty Metals¬†[Resources](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/resources)¬†in Hong Kong and for Umicore in Belgium.

Other major TechMet shareholders are the Qatar Investment Authority, S2G Investments and Lansdowne Partners.¬†

# AUGUST 28th, 2025~US accelerates push to rebuild critical minerals supply chain as China tightens¬†grip

**American firms are receiving federal support to rebuild the domestic critical mineral¬†industry**

[US accelerates push to rebuild critical minerals supply chain as China tightens grip | TechSpot](https://www.techspot.com/news/109247-us-accelerates-push-rebuild-critical-minerals-supply-chain.html)

https://preview.redd.it/w8hkymf0mxlf1.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=e01bd9605fcc0e51cb3bdf74d25d86131ae706a5

**The big picture:**¬†The United States is ramping up domestic production of critical minerals amid concerns over China's dominance in global supply. The White House has pledged billions of dollars to boost the industry at home and reduce reliance on Beijing, which still controls the vast majority of rare earths and related products.

The Pentagon is investing $400 million in MP Materials, a Nevada-based rare-earth producer¬†[building](https://apnews.com/article/rare-earths-critical-minerals-trump-china-tariffs-edf8ff79ec97d7245f64afa9f9ac713a)¬†a new magnet plant in Fort Worth, Texas. The effort includes a $150 million Department of Defense loan and a guarantee to purchase all magnets produced at the facility. Officials also set a minimum price for the company's neodymium and praseodymium output ‚Äì two rare-earth elements critical to high-strength magnets ‚Äì for the next decade.

Other US companies are receiving similar support, marking an unprecedented level of government intervention in the industry. NioCorp, a Nebraska firm extracting niobium, titanium, scandium, and rare earths, received up to $10 million from the Pentagon this year to fund exploratory drilling. The company is also seeking $1.2 billion for a larger project.

Meanwhile, USA Rare Earth plans to produce roughly 600 tons of rare-earth magnets in Oklahoma by 2026. That would complement operations at Noveon Magnetics, south of Austin, Texas, currently the only US facility actively manufacturing rare-earth magnets. That manufacturer is ramping up production to 2,000 tons annually.

https://preview.redd.it/d5q0xhn9mxlf1.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=a87687d5ce751d382c2e2f417dd67a185c808839

Supply concerns over rare earths intensified earlier this year when Beijing imposed new export restrictions, temporarily halting production at Ford's Louisville Assembly Plant. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence notes that domestic producers supply only a fraction of the 35,000 tons of rare-earth magnets the US consumes annually. Analysts project demand could double over the next decade as clean energy and defense industry use cases grow.

In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order warning that dependence on foreign producers for 50 key minerals ‚Äì including 17 rare earth elements ‚Äì posed ""acute"" threats to national and economic security. These minerals are critical for precision-guided missiles, submarines, fighter jets, robotics, and renewable energy infrastructure.

The US has combined federal aid with tariff threats and international negotiations. President Trump criticized China for dominating the global magnet market but said the United States has more substantial leverage. He suggested that if China were to cut off magnet exports, Washington could respond with tariffs of up to 200 percent on Chinese goods or restrict exports of airplane parts used in Chinese-operated Boeing jets.

Despite the sharp rhetoric, White House staff are working to stabilize trade relations, suggesting punitive measures may no longer be necessary. Chinese officials have expressed a preference for cooperation. Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun stated this week that Beijing supports ""mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and mutually beneficial cooperation"" in managing economic ties with Washington.

# Industry leaders say significant challenges remain in reducing decades-long dependence on Chinese-mined and processed minerals. NioCorp CEO Mark Smith, who has spent more than 40 years in the industry, told The Associated Press that China has undercut competitors by keeping prices low, acquiring mines worldwide, and advancing refining technologies while limiting environmental constraints. Previous efforts to build American alternatives routinely collapsed under these conditions.

Currently, US companies face the added challenge of scaling operations quickly enough to meet surging demand. Even with MP Materials, Noveon, and USA Rare Earth adding more capacity, domestic production will fall short of the 35,000 tons needed to satisfy US consumption ‚Äì and far below the projected doubled demand by the mid-2030s.

Congress has allocated substantial additional resources to the effort. This year's tax and spending legislation included $2 billion to expand the Pentagon's rare earth stockpile and $5 billion through 2029 for long-term supply chain development. Between 2020 and 2024, the Defense Department awarded more than $439 million in rare earth-related contracts.

The administration has also sought foreign supplies. President Trump has worked to secure critical minerals in Greenland and Ukraine, while a peace deal in central Africa between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda could eventually open US access to resources there, though the outcome remains uncertain.

Analysts remain divided on whether US domestic efforts will suffice. Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute said the White House might ultimately accept a deal in which China guarantees rare-earth shipments to the US ‚Äì a move he warned could undermine economic independence.

Rare metals expert David Abraham, author of The Elements of Power, told AP that American mines remain years away from producing a significant new supply.

""Everyone agrees the US still has to work out a deal with the Chinese because American companies need more rare earths and specialized magnets than can be produced domestically,"" Abraham said.

***Aluminum-Scandium (AlSc) alloys are lightweight metal alloys first widely used in the aerospace industry. More recently, high-scandium-content AlSc targets have gained prominence in semiconductor manufacturing, where they can be sputtered reactively with nitrogen to produce piezoelectric AlScN layers. These layers are used in MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) actuators and sensors as well as radiofrequency filters for mobile communication devices, particularly newer broadband applications such as 5G or the latest WiFi standards.***

Materion maintains a center of competence for AlSc targets at our Alzenau, Germany, facility. From there we ship AlSc targets with a variety of scandium concentrations to destinations around the world. These range from AlSc7a% to AlSc43a%, with R&D prototypes possible at or even beyond AlSc50a%.

Materion tailors key physical properties of its AlSc targets, including microstructure and precise scandium concentration, resulting in highly customized targets. These targets enable our business partners to produce market-leading, high-quality RF devices with higher-than-average yields.

We are also committed to research and development, and to investigating future target solutions for next-generation piezoelectric devices in cooperation with our customers.

# The main obstacle to wider use of AlSc targets is the high cost and somewhat limited availability of Scandium, a rare earth element found in low concentrations in various ores around the world. Its extraction and purification are expensive, leading to low levels of global production of semiconductor-grade, high-purity scandium metal.

Materion recognizes these challenges and partners with its customers to ensure a steady supply of high-quality AlSc targets. Our experienced supply chain team navigates the continually shifting global rare earth market to support semiconductor manufacturers in the communications and other fields.

We got married two years ago and now have a 6 month old. We‚Äôve travelled and ended up interstate away from our families and have settled in a lovely coastal city. 

I have a friend who I grew up with in high school, went to college with and now lives in the same city as we do. She has been through numerous relationships in the time my husband has gotten to know her, and we have met and socialised with all of them (even let her and her ex stay with us for 3 weeks when they first arrived)

She has now settled down with a nice guy and they too have a 6 month old baby (It was all very coincidental with the timing). They were only married last year, and as a gift, instead of money we gifted them a night at a resort as a group. 

My husband has had previous mumblings that we don‚Äôt seem to hang out much with my friend and her partner despite both being away from our families and living only minutes away. 

He‚Äôs invited them to birthdays and coffees previously but the effort is not reciprocated. It‚Äôs been a year since we did the night at the resort together. My husband has not had much communication or catchups with the couple since.

I on the other hand have had 4-5 catch ups with my friend since we both had our babies, as we‚Äôre both on maternity leave. My friends partner was home once when I popped over, but that‚Äôs the extent of me seeing him. 

My husband feels that they are not good friends given our circumstances (living in same city, away from family). He believes that they don‚Äôt like our company and we are just a box to tick for them, cos they often post doing things with other friends on social media. 

I‚Äôm more easy going and feel that they‚Äôve got other friends just as we also do. My husband acknowledges this, but it‚Äôs the fact that we have not seen them for a group catch up in over a year now, that it‚Äôs poor form in his eyes. He notes that they are happy to make plans with me, and feels that it‚Äôs something to do with him. The lack of effort in acknowledging him is enough to know that they don‚Äôt like him. He‚Äôs also saying that as his wife, I shouldn‚Äôt be supporting people who would treat him like this. 

I completely disagree with everything that he is suggesting and have brought up the fact that she is my friend and we have history. I did acknowledge however that there is minimal effort/acknowledgement on their side to include my husband in any catch ups. I also suggested that they are probably clueless of their actions. I absolutely hate confrontation, and am unsure of how to address this with my friend‚Ä¶or if I even should. 

My husband thinks I will continue to hang out with my friend ‚Äúchoose her and play happy families‚Äù and not support him and his feelings about the situation.

also jere's biggest ""plus"" that belly claimed was how he was able to put on a happy face even when he's sad, and gives out verbal validation to her (""charm offensive"" as she put it in s2) that ended up being his biggest flaw this season ironically.

jeremiah has always been all talk, he tries to talk his way out of everything. we can see instances like that in the previous seasons. when he says ""connie what can he do?"" about adam and the beach house fiasco, conrad calls out that adam never cared for the house. he is super naive and doesnt even know what hes doing most of the time, he go excited at the idea of another family letting them ""rent"" the beach house every summer, conrad was the only one who called bs and recognized how ridiculous it sounded.

we also see the difference being pointed out I think? jere goes by the ""let's charm aunt julia with flowers, into changing her mind about the house"" and points out conrad would never go that route bc he knows it wouldnt work (and did it? ofc not lol)

conrad actually took it up to himself to research about lawsuits through his friend, and was willing to straight up sue adam if he didn't budge about the trust fund money thing. he was willing to go through extreme measures to save that house, literally fighting everyone for it. it comes off ""toxic"" to people, but sometimes you have to be harsh to get things done and can't always charm your way out of everything. jeremiah didnt have the backbone or conviction that conrad had, also seen in the difference in how they reacted to adam insulting laurel (and by an extension, belly). he tried placating belly but was too cowardly to stand up to adam for her, conrad jumped ti belly and laurel's defence the moment he saw the look on belly's face.

this season jeremiah has been anything BUT reliable, that makes his line even funnier. he knew about christmas, so he premeditates a fight and uses it as an excuse to cheat, proposes to ""fix"" the problem when all that did was slap a bandaid without clemaning the wound (aka, adressong the rrot cause of the problem, which was his insecurity and his knowledge of christmas 2.0) he tries to go by the ""let's charm laurel with flowers into agreeing to our wedding"" thing, and basically never tried convincing her again, when belly voiced her concerns about looking at a see full of random people in her wedding, what was jeremiah's solution? ""Don't look at them, look at me"".

he's always honey coating everything and uses it to cover up a wound instead of healing it, while conrad basically dragged laurel to belly the moment he found out belly wasn't eating because of it.

conrad laid out the facts to laurel, plain and simple, and the risks of how she would feel in the future if she skipped the wedding, which was enough to convince her, while jeremiah went on an immature ""that's what my mom would've wanted"" rant that laurel wasn't swayed by. he wasnt able to come up with a single convincing argument to convince her.

jeremiah also sweet talks his dad and brings him coffee to charm him into agreeing for the wedding, that's ALL he keeps doing. talking. and more talking.

but belly latches on to the fact that he validates her verbally, and sugar coats things for her simply to give her temporary gratification, even though it's just empty words without depth, and uses that as a foundation to her cling to the relationship, and uses that against conrad.

he says laurel would come around on her own, makes empty promises about the wedding fiasco about how they'll ""get through it together"" telling her he's got her back but he never actually did, he bailed on wedding shopping, demanded things, never had an answer when he was asked what his future plan was, which technically you're supposed to answer that, to show people that you're actually capable of handling a wedding, he was only able to say that he ""wanted to be with belly"" ???

conrad struggled with words, but actually had logical solutions that SOLVED belly's problems and eased her worries, like when he gently suggested using susannah's hydrangeas for the wedding instead of spending 5k, suggesting switching the mirror glaze and cutting out the cacao when belly got all sad saying they'll have to buy their cake at a grocery store or something, so she'll still be able to shop at her favourite bakery, immediately moving steven into a known doctor and uses his connections to quickly aid belly without a second thought.

Belly dislikes that conrad doesnt fake his mood, and says stuff like it is, bc she is the complete opposite. she is the eternal optimist, which isnt a bad thing but this quality of hers quickly turns into toxic positivity and delusion, she's kinda like jere in that aspect, even to an extent susannah. 

Conrad seems harsh and no nonsense, but he literally cancelled his flight and baked her muffins once he heard belly sob all alone, despite getting mocked by her. jeremiah is the type to say ""feel better okay?"" makes a couple jokes and leaves, but conrad would be the one who stays with belly the whole time and rub her back when she cries. 

They kinda symbolised that when conrad literally got told to go to hell by her at his mom's FUNERAL but still helped her up when she tripped instead of leaving her there to be embarrassed (you cannot tell me jere would've helped her up lol, he would've been vindictive and just left her there)

he's very similar to laurel in that aspect, takes no bs, seems cold and uncaring but does end up being there. I think we've also noticed how belly argues with laurel for the same reason she does with conrad, because she dislikes their approach, and how they call her out when necessary.

and now he can actually communicate, so belly's ""issues"" with conrad are literally no longer issues anymore. he's the ONE. Always has been.

conrad is the example of a logical character well written, people stereotype logical characters as debbie downers, but he suggested realistic solutions to belly SO gently while uplifting her mood at the same time, like when he said they could even use pretty fake flowers bc theyre on budget and manages to get belly, who was weirded out at first, on board because of how genuinely happy he sounded with the idea, same with the mirror glaze, he got belly laughing in 2 mins while simultaneously solving the issue.",22,1756464775.0,tsitp,6,0.93,False

Clive watched Ros intently as she practiced her martial arts a few meters away. She was a young woman set broadly with healthy thighs, short, unruly pink hair, and flawless light pink skin. Never before had he experienced such feelings for a woman. He didn‚Äôt know if he was captivated by her physical beauty or the beauty of her combat prowess. The combination of the two fed into each other, amplifying their effects and enchanting Clive like a siren song. But as she practiced combat with her Bo staff, she soon noticed Clive staring at her.¬†

Ros marched up to him, groaning. ""Let me guess. You're wondering why the Nemesis isn't in chains, right human?""

As Ros approached him, Clive straightened his back as he stood at attention. His mind ran many times faster than it ever had before, trying to figure out what to say to her. In truth, he was curious about how a Nemesis came to join their side of the war. However, for more reasons than one he feared his queries would sound derogatory. Still, the time to answer had arrived as Ros reached him, piercing through his soul with her glimmering yellow pupils.

‚ÄúWell?‚Äù

""N-no.‚Äù Clive vigorously shook his hands before his body. ‚ÄúI'm sorry for staring. I know it's rude.""

Ros looked at Clive, blushing. ""Apology accepted. So what's your name?""

""Clive Rogers. And you?""

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Äî. Wait, Lieutenant Clive Rogers?‚Äù

Clive nodded.

""Ros Lightwell.""

""Okay, I have to know. How‚Äî""

""Did a Nemesis get involved with the United Planets?‚Äù Ros interrupted.

Clive nodded again.

‚ÄúIt's a long, painful story, but my comrades and I came to our senses. We defected and now we want nothing more than to end Mavor's deranged campaign.""

""Glad to have you aboard."" Clive relaxed, shooting Ros a smile.

""Glad to be here."" Ros extended her arm for a handshake.¬†

Clive shook Ros‚Äôs hand, but he still held it after. His grasp on her slightly tightened enough to enjoy her touch without hurting her as he grew a faint smile. Ros‚Äôs heart rate increased. ‚ÄúI have to go.‚Äù As she pulled away from Clive.

‚ÄúDo you need a sparring partner?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you ask?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am a lieutenant. Maybe I can teach you something?‚Äù

Ros, relenting, nudged her head in the direction where she was going. Clive soon followed behind Ros, walking to her preferred spot. And as they stood before each other, they took fighting stances, beginning martial arts training. The two swiftly began trading blows. Ros gave Clive a jab to his face. Clive in turn gave a knee to her stomach, and she retaliated with a kick to the side of his head. However, as he blocked the strike, the pattern continued.

\*\*\*

The battle between the two lasted at least an hour. The combatants continuously landed heavy blows on one another. But as the punches to their bodies mounted, tired, wheezing laughter escaped their mouths instead of screams. As Ros went to throw another, she tripped in her exhausted state, landing in Clive‚Äôs arms.

Ros blushed, looking at Clive inches from his face, hurrying away. ‚ÄùSorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis has been a fun workout, but maybe we s‚Äî‚Äú

Someone threw a juice bottle at Ros‚Äôs head, drenching her with the red beverage. As Clive searched madly for the perpetrator, his eyes widened as he saw it was his fellow United Planets soldiers.

""How many times do we have to tell you? We want to see your face as little as possible, Nemesis. So why are you still out here?""

""I-I'm sorry. I wanted to get a little more training. And I lost track of the time.""

""Leave.‚Äù The soldier pointed off into the distance. ‚ÄúJust looking at you makes me sick.""

Promptly, Ros heeded the soldier‚Äôs demands and started to leave. But Clive grabbed her arm, stopping her, and he glared at his fellow soldiers.¬†

As the soldier Ros was talking to saw him, he quickly walked to Clive with a similar glare. ""Are you humans with us or against us?""

""Go to h‚Äî""

""Clive, stop. They have every right to hate me.‚Äù Ros pulled her arm away from Clive. ‚ÄúI'm not worth fighting over.""

""But they can't just...Fine.""

Swiftly, Ros continued to leave, and Clive followed her.

""She's right when she says she's not worth fighting over. Because she's not worth anything.""

With the soldier's words, Clive's patience was exhausted. He stopped walking and directed a wrathful gaze at him. Hastily, Clive jogged back to the soldier, and he raised his fists for the impending attack. Still, his preparations were fruitless as Clive punched him in the face faster than he could defend, knocking him into a set of training weights.

A battle ignited in Ros‚Äôs name. The soldier got up and charged at Clive, but he backhanded him away. His comrades restrained Clive's arms, and again, he charged at him. Swiftly, the soldier punched Clive in the gut, but he broke free, head-butting his opponent in the mouth. However as he knocked away his comrades, a kick to one and an elbow to the face of the other, the violence prompted retaliation. Still, as Clive fought, knocking one opponent unconscious after the other, Damara ended the conflict.

Her shield flew through the crowd, hitting all the combatants in the face, including Clive, leaving them lying on the ground in pain. And even as they tried to recover, with one disappointed look from Daisy, the soldiers knew the battle was over.¬†

In her presence, the soldiers grew dead quiet. Daisy scanned through the crowd from left to right, ensuring everyone shared in her gaze.

""There was once a noble and wise Nemesis. He selflessly lay down his life for a girl who wasn‚Äôt even of his species. He believed in the dream that created this army.‚Äù Daisy stopped scanning the crowd just before reaching Ros. ‚ÄúHe believed the day would come after the war when all intelligent life could enjoy peace and freedom. So, like it or not, you will have to forgive the Nemesis. And if you have a problem with this, you have a problem with me.""

Her words came through as clear as day, and quickly the soldiers left. Ros dashed at Clive to check on him as they went, and Daisy followed her.

""Thanks, Damara. Those clowns were out of line,"" Clive said.

*""I wouldn't be so casual, Lieutenant Rogers. I'm just as angry with you as I am with them. I expected better from a friend of Carter‚Äî. I mean General Carter.""*

""She's right. I told you to back off, and now look what happened.‚Äù Ros cried. ‚ÄúIt's not even like I didn't deserve what they gave me.""

As she heard Ros, Daisy took her hands, looking at her with a smile.

""My problems with Lieutenant Rogers aside, what those soldiers did was wrong. Everyone deserves kindness, especially the repentant.""

Daisy‚Äôs words hit Ros with more force than Clive‚Äôs punches. For so long, she endured the hatred of the Nemesis Empire‚Äôs victims. However, now, the hero of the galaxy, the greatest enemy of the empire she once served, came to her with words of kindness and redemption. She fell into a crying frenzy, bawling her eyes out. As Daisy saw her turmoil, she comforted her with a hug.¬†

\*\*\*

Amongst the hustle and bustle of the base, Favian and Carter shared a rare moment of agreement. They both looked upon an embarrassed Clive with frustration for his actions, especially Favian, as a vein bulged on his forehead.

""Clive, bud, what's the one thing you know I didn't want you to do?""

""Erode discipline.""

*""And what did you go and do?""*¬†Carter shouted.

""Erode discipline.""

""Sirs, I think I should take some responsibility. I should have tried harder to pull him out of it,"" Ros said.

""I think the same goes for me. I did a poor job keeping our promise, General Favian.""

""No, you're both wrong.‚Äù Favian ran his hand over his head. ‚ÄúThese events are reflections of us as generals. If our subordinates lack discipline, then it‚Äôs no one's fault but our own. At least everything else is running smoothly.""

Everyone looked off behind Favian, gazing intently at something. As Favian saw them, he followed their gaze to witness what they saw. His eyes soon fixed on Yara as she sweated a deluge.

""Yara, what is it?"" Favian asked.

""Well, General Favian, I don't want to give you any more bad news, but we have problems. Our troops have reported several snags with the evacuation.""

""Such as?""

""In Palus Urbs and several other settlements in the area, they've experienced difficulty moving the critically ill. They need more time and resources to do it safely or run the risk of‚Äî"" Yara moved her thumb across her neck, mimicking a blade slashing her windpipe as she coughed out.¬†

The veins on Favian‚Äôs forehead bulged again as he saw her display, placing his hand over his face.

""Yara, I believe the visual presentation was unnecessary. But by the gods, what else could go wrong?""

In outer space, the answer to Favian's question sped through the void at light speed. A giant mechanical structure charged toward the western planets with relentless progression.

A massive crowd of civilians, hundreds of thousands of people, came to the United Planets base. As they stood outside the gates, Carter soon came to meet them. But as he saw Daisy limp and filthy in one of their arms, unconscious, his heart nearly stopped. His promise to Mary echoed through his mind as he hurried to her aid.

*""What happened to Damara? Were you attacked?""*¬†Carter shouted.

""No, General Carter.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúDamara worked relentlessly around the city, saving people. We don't even think she took the time to eat or drink. So when she finally collapsed, we brought her here.""

‚ÄúWe had to come here anyway. But Damara‚Äôs health made it more urgent.‚Äù

Carter swiftly took Daisy out of the civilian's arms into his own. His gratitude for them was apparent as he tightly gripped her body.¬†

""Thank you. Now, please come in and wait for instructions. We need to get you all to safety.""

\*\*\*

The sunset came over the battle of planet Aqua. In the infirmary, the staff ran about caring for the hundreds upon hundreds of patients. The medical ward was over two thousand square feet and nearing capacity. Daisy still lay unconscious in a bed off in a corner. Still, the doctors screamed orders at the nurses as they treated the injured, stirring her from sleep. The commands repeated themselves again and again, growing louder from desperation.¬†

*‚ÄúMore bandages, more disinfectant, more antibiotics.‚Äù*¬†A doctor shouted.

Daisy finally awakened from her slumber to jump out of bed, screaming.

*""The people?""*¬†Daisy shouted.

A nurse came to Daisy. ""Damara, be calm. The evacuations are running as we speak. Please get back into bed.""

Daisy heeded the nurse's orders, and as she sat down, she noticed Carter, sitting in a chair beside her, asleep.

""Carter, I mean General Carter.‚Äù Daisy pointed her trembling finger at him. ‚ÄúH-how long has he been here?""

""He hasn't left your side since you came.‚Äù The nurse giggled. ‚ÄúI'm not one to gossip, but the other nurses and I think our handsome general has a crush.""

Daisy uttered a chuckle. ""I‚Äôm flattered.""

Daisy spotted Lucas hooked up to life support, unconscious, with Sarah sleeping by his bedside.¬†

Daisy stared at Lucas, turning her shaking finger to him. ""My friend. Will he be okay?""

""That pilot suffered a concussion, and one of his broken ribs punctured a lung. He might not have made it this far had we operated later.""

""But he'll make a full recovery?""

""I-I don't know.""

Daisy took a deep breath. ""Whose in command right now?""

""General Favian.""

""Has he ordered any action against the enemy?""

""None that I know of.""

""Thank you for your diligent care. But I have to go now."" Daisy zoomed out of the room.

\*\*\*

Yara guided Daisy to Favian in his office. The place was a mess, with his trident on the floor amongst broken pieces of furniture and dozens upon dozens of scattered papers and books from the Nemesis attack. As she saw him, shock covered her face. He sat on his desk, his blue skin now pale, as if he were awaiting death with a frown. But still, she ran to him with dire urgency.

""General Favian, what are we doing to repel the enemy?""

""It doesn't matter.""

*""W-what do you mean?""*

""We don't have enough troops left to attack the fortress. And I can't call in reinforcements because the Nemesis ships are coming back. If I move them now, we risk losing more territory.‚Äù Favian gripped his forehead. ‚ÄúI knew the retreat from earlier was a trap, but I still fell for it.""

""Why can't we call for help from General Lev or R√≥ngy√π?""

""Neither would get here in time.""

Daisy quickly pulled Favian off the desk, trying to intensely shake sense into him.

""Listen to me, man. As long as there's time and breath in our bodies, we can't give up.""

‚ÄùDamara, I‚Äôve been dedicated to the cause for years.‚Äù Favian pushed Daisy away. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve forsaken my very culture to keep going in this vile war.‚Äù

Daisy looked at Favian, awaiting more information. As he saw her, he sighed, struggling to force his mouth to surrender the details.

‚ÄúI still remember the dark day as a child. You see, my people champion pacifism. We find the taking of any life to be unforgivable. So, we were unprepared when the Nemesis attacked the first time.‚Äù Favian sat on his desk again, placing his hand over his face. ‚ÄúMadman Zola subjected prisoners to unspeakable experiments. It was only by the gods that Orion arrived in time. I swore, even if I had to forsake every value I held, I would never let that evil befall anyone again.""

""I understand. Yara, please give me and the general a little privacy?""

Yara fulfilled Daisy's request and swiftly left. Daisy searched the room as she was gone, ensuring no prying eyes and ears. Favian looked at her, bewildered, as she rummaged through the debris. But soon she reverted from Damara to her original form before Favian's eyes. And he nearly jumped out of his blue skin as he saw the transformation.

""Please, be calm, General Favian. It's still me, but I'm in my true form. And my real name is Daisy David.""

""Orion did say there were details about your identity we couldn't know. So why are you telling me this?""

""I needed to tell you we were in the same boat. I was an ordinary seamstress, and I didn't think I had the strength to be a warrior.‚Äù Daisy pulled Favian to his feet. ‚ÄúBut when the time came to do the right thing, I had to soldier on, no matter how much it tore me apart. Please don't give up.""

Favian gazed at Daisy. Her genuine form appeared like fragile porcelain. The hero of the galaxy was a young human woman who looked as weary as he was. Her words reverberated through his mind, becoming louder and louder as he thought about them. But slowly, he took up his trident from the floor, gripping it tightly with his will to fight reignited.

""Let's go.""

\*\*\*

Daisy and Favian hurried into Eugene's lab. And they found him sitting by his lab table, recording something on a holophone panel.

""Eugene, what are you doing?"" Daisy asked.

""Well, Damara, seeing that I'm going to die here. I decided to write my will for the family on Earth.""

""Don't send it just yet.‚Äù Daisy banged her fist on his table. ‚ÄúWe can still win this, and we need you to pull it off.""

""W-why, how?""

""We can fend off the legion of Nemesis ships coming here. But we need you to fix your guardian barrier.""

""I-it doesn't matter.‚Äù Eugene shook his head vigorously. ‚ÄúWith that stupid fortress up, it can pop again like a balloon.""

‚ÄúEugene, we‚Äôre going to take it down. We‚Äôll use every power, every weapon, every drop of strength. But it‚Äôll mean nothing without your help, so please.‚Äù

Eugene gazed deeply into Daisy‚Äôs eyes. He saw sincerity as well as unrelenting determination. They pierced through his despair with their strong emotions. And as he punched his forehead, he made a reluctant decision, cracking a crooked smile.

""I guess it's time to be a man. I still think we're doomed, but I'll do my best either way.""

As she heard Eugene, a smile overtook Daisy's face. Quickly, she hugged him tightly, pressing him against her breasts. And being so close to the beautiful Damara made him blush bright red, his spine becoming as stiff as a board.

""Thank you, Eugene.""

*""N-no problem. Now, please, let go of me. My heart is about to burst.""*

Meanwhile, at darkhold, another explosion went off. A small ship flew away from the fortress. The Nemesis was in hot pursuit, firing at it. Inside, freed slaves cowered in fear as their savior struggled to evade the enemy forces. It was the female human slave Cymbeline argued with on Placentia: Anastasia. But the enemy hit them, sending them all crashing into a swamp.

\*\*\*

At the base, Yara ran up to Daisy and Favian, short of breath.

""Thank the lawgiver, I found you two. We have a new problem.""

""What could it possibly be now?"" Favian asked with a heavy breath.

""It's a distress signal, General Favian. And according to our readings, it's the United Planets code. But get this, it's coming from a swamp near darkhold.""

""Do they think we're that foolish?‚Äù Favian uttered a dry laugh. ‚ÄúIt's a trap.""

""B-but what if it's not? The initial onslaught did a lot of damage,"" Daisy said.

""You want to make sure, don't you?""

Daisy nodded to Favian's question.

""Very well then, Damara. Verify this signal and then get back here quickly. In the meantime, we'll rally our remaining forces, agreed?""

""Sir, yes, sir.""

Later, Daisy sneaked through the dense vegetation of the swamp. As she neared her destination, she pulled out a pair of binoculars to survey the area. And she spotted Anastasia and the other slaves near their crashed ship. Seeing the injured in their group, Daisy dashed over. But as she reached them, she stepped on a twig, alerting Anastasia to her presence. She shot at Daisy with her plasma gun. However, she dropped her weapon and covered her mouth with her hands, seeing Daisy guarding behind her shield from the attack.

*‚ÄúI-I am so incredibly sorry,‚Äù*¬†Anastasia said in Russian.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not familiar with that language. Can you please speak Novice?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was apologizing for almost shooting you, Damara. Truly amateur work,"" Anastasia said in Novice.

Daisy looked at Anastasia's clothes and recognized their design.

""You're a human slave. But how can this be? I thought you were all liberated.""

""It all started a little before you saved the Earth. My government gave us a mission to infiltrate the enemy and transmit any vital information. We knew that the high-ranking officers received slaves. So we took it as an opportunity to get close to their secrets. I‚Äôve had to do quite a few dirty things.""

""They treated all of you like animals, didn't they?""

""Worse than animals. But it was worth it to get this."" Anastasia pulled a small black chip from her hair and handed it to Daisy. ""This chip contains the secret to destroying a fully charged darkhold fortress.""

""Really? What is it?""

""I don't know. The file I got is encrypted. I had to get myself and these people out before General Cymbeline burned us to ash.""

Daisy kissed the chip. ""I don't know how to thank you for your bravery and sacrifice.""

""Win this war, and that will be gratitude enough.""

A roaring sound filled the air. Anastasia looked for the source, and she spotted the terrifying answer. A squadron of Nemesis ships had found them. The enemy swiftly initiated an air strike, bombarding them with plasma. But Daisy grew her shield to a giant size, protecting everyone on the ground from the attack.

*""Damara, listen to me. Abandon us and get the chip to the United Planets.""*

""You're insane.""

""We're dead weight, and before we escaped, I overheard them say the repairs on the fortress were almost complete.""

As the bombardment intensified, a realization plagued Daisy's mind. She knew getting them to safety on Flaremane was impossible. The squadron would pick them off like lambs to the slaughter. And she couldn‚Äôt stay and fight either. Every passing second drew the darkhold fortress closer to raining terror again. But as she glanced at the crashed ship, she made a gamble in her stubbornness to protect everyone.

""Everyone, please get into your ship over there quickly.""

*""What?""*¬†Anastasia shouted.

""I beg you, trust me.""

Anastasia reluctantly led the slaves onto the ship. As they were all inside, Daisy summoned Flaremane. She hurried to her stallion, picking up the crashed ship. She swiftly launched her shield at the attacking forces. And as they evaded the assault, Daisy raced away with the slaves through the air.

The squadron promptly gave chase to Daisy, shooting at her. One of their shots grazed the ship, and Daisy quickly called back her shield. When it came to Daisy, it cleaved through some of them, leaving the rest to continue the attack. But as the shield blocked their onslaught, Daisy pulled on Flaremane's reins, summoning his speed to escape.

\*\*\*

Daisy arrived with the slaves at the United Planets base. As she dismounted from Flaremane, she gently placed the ship on the ground. The slaves soon exited the vessel, running to the infirmary as she directed them, but Anastasia, instead, slowly walked up to Daisy, her lips tightly pursed.

""Damara, why did you risk the information for us? Don't you comprehend what's at stake?""

""Of course I do, but the one thing worse than losing this war would be a Cadmean victory. The moment we deem it acceptable to sacrifice innocents is when we lose.""

Anastasia's eyes widened as she heard Daisy. But her face soon formed a smile.

""My name is Anastasia Nikolaev. During training, they taught us to keep our names secret. So please consider this gratitude for everything you did.""

""I'm honored."" Daisy giggled.

Like thunder, Daisy heard something big collapse. The sounds of rioters followed, and she dashed to the commotion to learn why. And as she found the source, she looked on, dropping to her knees and covering her mouth with both hands.

Moving here soon and weighing two apartments. Would love to hear from people who know these areas:

**The Options:**

* **Alphabet City (E 6th & Ave C):**¬†$1,425/month, 3b/1b. Classic EV energy ‚Äî bars, restaurants, always something happening. Noisier but more action. Smaller room without a window, but already furnished. 8 minute walk to EV as well as GYM NYC. Fair walk to L train, about 35 min total commute to my office.
* **Greenpoint (Calyer St/Nassau Ave):**¬†$1,616/month, 3b/1b. Better apartment overall ‚Äî more space, pretty nice bathroom. Doesn't have as much going on as EV. Picturesque neighborhood, good coffee spots. 10 min walk to the office (5 min if I time the bus right).

**About me:**¬†Mid-20s in tech sales, working on advancing my career while building podcast/media projects on the side. Want to be around driven people who are actually making things happen. I lift regularly, enjoy going out, but also need space to focus on side hustles. Meeting quality people ‚Äî both for networking and dating ‚Äî is really important to me. I'll be honest, I'm drawn to ambitious, attractive women (some would call me a ""modelizer"", but I care a lot about brains/presence too).

**What I'm curious about:**

* How do these neighborhoods actually feel day-to-day for someone with my priorities?
* Any thoughts on the dating scene differences? Which area tends to have more of the type I'm looking for?
* Does location really impact networking opportunities in NYC, or am I overthinking it?

1n343hr,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1n343hr/calorie_deficit_is_easy/,Calorie deficit is easy,"so I have a history of disordered eating so avoided calorie counting as it seemed too triggering. But I gave in as after having a child, and working a desk job, things just weren‚Äôt the same as before. I realised it will take more than what I have done in the past when I effortlessly could lose 40lbs. 

I also feel social media makes calorie deficits look so hard. And kinda makes them look like they are disordered. Um like if you‚Äôre overweight, your body will just get what it needs from your fat cells which is the whole point! 

Anyway, prior to my recent fitness journey, as a busy mum, I got in the habit of takeaway and just eating whatever was easiest and quickest but still tasty. 
 

Prior to child birth and pregnancy, I had bad digestive issues so never really enjoyed food. It was only after childbirth and when I was breastfeeding I truly began to love food again. My appetite was crazy and my digestive issues weren‚Äôt that bad as I learned how to manage them. 

But I decided I want to be fit. I wanted to feel confident and pretty again. 

At first it seems difficult but now I realise how easy it is to stay low calorie. I just avoid eating out. And have gone back to eating simple whole foods instead of more processed foods. I also avoid obviously high calorie foods like oils and butter, nuts, and nut butter. I try to eat as much raw foods that don‚Äôt require cooking as possible as that is ultimately easier and then you don‚Äôt need to use oil. But I do cook some things obviously. 

When we get used to eating very tasty processed foods and takeaway, we can forget how unnecessary they are. Btw I am not completely against highly processed foods. I eat protein bars sometimes, protein chips when I‚Äôm craving chips, and protein shakes. I just use them as a supplement sparingly. 

Now I actually get genuinely excited to eat plain fruit like berries, watermelon, avocado, and apples. I absolutely love having my big salad sandwich (low carb bread) for lunch and my yoghurt bowl for breakfast. I have one coffee or matcha with milk a day and savour it instead of having them mindlessly throughout the day with no thought. 

I am very intentional with food now and actually enjoy simple foods. 

I feel I could go even lower calorie than I am but I love food and I am already losing weight rapidly so don‚Äôt feel the need to go lower.

Moving here soon and weighing two apartments. Would love to hear from people who know these areas:

**The Options:**

* **Alphabet City (E 6th & Ave C):** $1,425/month, 3b/1b. Classic EV energy ‚Äî bars, restaurants, always something happening. Noisier but more action. Smaller room without a window, but already furnished. 8 minute walk to EV as well as GYM NYC. Fair walk to L train, about 35 min total commute to my office.
* **Greenpoint (Calyer St/Nassau Ave):** $1,616/month, 3b/1b. Better apartment overall ‚Äî more space, pretty nice bathroom. Doesn't have as much going on as EV. Picturesque neighborhood, good coffee spots. 10 min walk to the office (5 min if I time the bus right).

**About me:** Mid-20s in tech sales, working on advancing my career while building podcast/media projects on the side. Want to be around driven people who are actually making things happen. I lift regularly, enjoy going out, but also need space to focus on side hustles. Meeting quality people ‚Äî both for networking and dating ‚Äî is really important to me. I'll be honest, I'm drawn to ambitious, attractive women (some would call me a ""modelizer"", but I care a lot about brains/presence too).

**What I'm curious about:**

* How do these neighborhoods actually feel day-to-day for someone with my priorities?
* Any thoughts on the dating scene differences? Which area tends to have more of the type I'm looking for?
* Does location really impact networking opportunities in NYC, or am I overthinking it?
* What would you choose and why?

Also totally open to other neighborhood suggestions if you think there's something I should consider. Just want to hear different perspectives from people who've been there.

But here I was at a new job. First day at work, although I might have lied to get into a role I had never worked in before, I am intelligent, confident and capable enough to do any work, and true to my word, I was giving a task I have never done before and I did it. Before I dive deep into the story, let me give you a little background story to who I know I am and what I do. 

My Name is Sophia (Sophie‚Äôs Tales), I am a project manager on any other day, but on every other day, I am a writer, and don‚Äôt limit me with your little thinking to just one style of writing, I am versatile, yes I said it! I have written movies; fiction and nonfiction, real-life stories, biographies, company profiles, kids stories,  poems and every form of writing imaginable, except for obituaries, I am yet to do that. Now that you have met me, back to my new job. So, here I was at a new job as a Product Manager, they slid a fat folder across the conference table like it was a death sentence. ‚ÄúSince you‚Äôre the new Product Manager, maybe you can solve this one,‚Äù one of the men smirked. The lady raised her brow like she was about to witness a public execution.
The task? A tangled mess: three departments wanted one app feature, all in different ways, none willing to compromise. Basically, a recipe for office Armageddon.

I took a deep breath, flipped open the folder, and instead of panicking, I grabbed a marker. I drew three overlapping circles on the whiteboard, then labeled them with the departments‚Äô names. The guys leaned back, arms crossed. The lady sighed.
‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the deal,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf all of you want different things, we‚Äôll just give you the same thing, disguised differently.‚Äù
I mapped out one clever core feature, then dressed it up three ways, so each department felt they had ‚Äòwon.‚Äô By the time I dropped the marker, everyone was blinking at me like I had just turned water into Wi-Fi.
The smirking guy actually clapped. The lady muttered, ‚ÄúI hate that this makes sense.‚Äù And me? I just sat there sipping the last of my cold coffee like it was part of the plan all along.
Just when I thought the show was over, the bosses leaned back, nodding like I‚Äôd just invented sliced bread. Compliments flew around the table, apparently, I was now the genius Product Manager nobody saw coming. I wanted to bask in the glory, but honestly, I was in a hurry to pack my bag and escape before someone gave me another folder of doom.

Then, betrayal. Instead of ending the meeting, they ordered food for everyone. And there I was, trapped, my body halfway out of the office, but my stomach firmly seated, waiting for my share. Because, let‚Äôs be honest, my love for food has stronger job security than I do.
And just as I was about to sink my teeth into a dream jollof rice, the office door morphed into my bedroom door, creaking open. I almost cursed the ‚Äòintruder,‚Äô only to see my sister standing there. Reality check. Dream over. Product Manager glory gone. And worst of all,  no food.

I went on a date last night that went really wrong and I just need to vent somewhere or get some feedback or advice. Idk. Sorry for the long rant. 

Some context and getting straight to the point: I'm 22 (f) and I'm trans. I refuse to let my being trans define me, but I am very open about it and about who I am. Everybody around me knows. Most of the time I‚Äôm really happy with life. I have an amazing family and an incredible group of friends who‚Äôve had my back through everything. The only thing I‚Äôve been struggling with is loneliness in the romantic sense. I get plenty of male attention, but most leave the moment they find out I‚Äôm trans. So here I am, 22, with very little experience in that area.

You can imagine how thrilled I was when my friend Marie asked if I‚Äôd be interested in going on a date with Jake (not his real name). He had expressed interest and she wanted to set us up. Jake and I have known each other for years but were never close. We have lots of mutual friends and see each other at parties, but he‚Äôs always had a girlfriend and we never talked much beyond small stuff.

Jake invited me out for drinks at his favorite cocktail bar last night. I was excited and really wanted everything to go well. I went shopping for a new dress, got my nails done and really tried my hardest on my hair and makeup. It worked, because I could see his eyes light up when I showed up. At first the date was amazing. We talked for hours and I laughed so much. I had eaten very light that day and the alcohol hit me a little hard, so he suggested a walk. It was perfect. We held hands, laughed some more and when I said I was getting cold, he invited me over for coffee at his place. And honestly I wanted nothing more.

Once we got there, it didn‚Äôt take long before we were making out on his couch. The kissing was exhilarating. At one point I was sitting on top of him and things were clearly about to go further. That‚Äôs when everything went wrong. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what I said, but it was something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre okay with me.‚Äù He looked confused and asked what I meant. My heart dropped. I carefully said, ‚ÄúYou do know I‚Äôm trans right?‚Äù

He pushed me off him gently at first and asked if I was joking. When I said I wasn‚Äôt, his whole demeanor changed. He started yelling, cussing, telling me I had tricked him and that I was disgusting. Eventually he shoved me really hard and I slammed into a cabinet. Then he came at me with his fist raised and stood there for what felt like forever. I froze, curled up, and just cried.

Suddenly his roommate was standing there, I guess because of the noise. I grabbed my purse and bolted.

I don‚Äôt know what to do now. I keep seeing that look in his eyes. I was so scared and I hate that my reaction was to freeze. I can‚Äôt stop crying. I've got a massive bruise on my back. I‚Äôm scared to tell anyone because I don‚Äôt want it to turn into a whole thing. I know I should have checked if he knew I was trans. I just really thought he did, Marie did too. And she's been texting me all mornign asking how it went and I don't know what to say. I just know she'll feel guilty and I don't want that.

1n33q2d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n33q2d,"Ashes of Ambition, link please?","Chapter 1
When Caiden Fowler had only seven days left to live, he begged Alexandra Clayton to give him a chance to make up for his regrets. 

""Alexandra, the truth is, I've always loved Leyla,"" he said. ""Now, at this point, I don't want to settle anymore. Can you sign the divorce papers and let me be with her?""

Yet, he was the one who had abandoned his wife and child, and now he was the one crying for reconciliation. 

... 

At Willow Haven Manor, a whip cracked through the air, striking the man kneeling in the courtyard. 

Bl**d mixed with rainwater, pooling beneath Caiden's knees. 

After what felt like an eternity, the sound of the whip finally stopped. 

Caiden's body swayed as he slowly lifted his pale, bloodless face. 

He looked toward the figure standing in the shadows under the corridor. ""Alexandra, let these hundred lashes settle the debt of the eight years I deceived you,"" he said. ""For the time I have left, I hope you won't disturb Leyla and me.""

With that, he struggled to his feet and walked toward the gate. 

Alexandra clenched her fists tightly upon hearing his words. 

She never imagined that her husband of seven years would leave her like this. 

""Caiden!"" She took two steps after him, her voice heavy. ""Aren't you afraid of losing everything, of your reputation crumbling?""

Caiden paused, then turned to meet her gaze, his voice calm. ""Given how things are now, what do I have left to fear?""

Without another word, he walked away, leaving no trace of hesitation. 

The gate opened and closed. 

Alexandra tasted bl**d in her mouth, unsure if the wetness on her face was rain or tears. 

After a moment, she called her lawyer. ""Draft a divorce agreement,"" she said. 

Then she instructed the household staff, ""Pack up all of Mr. Fowler's belongings and move them to storage.""

After finishing these tasks, Alexandra went upstairs. 

She took down their wedding photo and tossed it into the fire. 

The image of them, once so close, twisted and blurred in the flames. 

Her vision blurred as well. 

Caiden and Alexandra had been married for seven years, deeply in love. 

Or so she thought, until that day, when she realized it was all a lie. 

Three months earlier, Caiden went abroad on business and was kidnapped. 

Though he escaped, he had been injected with a new, unknown toxin. 

They tried everything to find an antidote, even funding a dedicated research lab. 

But no matter what they did, there was no progress. 

Despair crept into both their hearts. 

Until that day, when the lab confirmed Caiden's body could only hold out for one more week. 

That was when he came to Alexandra, begging for a chance to right his regrets. 

""Alexandra, my heart has always belonged to someone else,"" he said. ""With so little time left, I don't want to keep pretending. I hope you can let me go.""

Only then did Alexandra realize she had always been his compromise. 

The door clicked open. 

Her assistant strode in with a stack of documents. ""Ms. Clayton, we've gathered information on Leyla Morrison and her past with Mr. Fowler.""

Alexandra flipped through the files. 

Leyla and Caiden had once been lovers. 

Leyla came from a humble background, while Caiden was the heir to a wealthy family. 

Their love had faced fierce opposition from his family. 

In the end, Caiden chose his family over Leyla, abandoning her. 

Now, for Leyla, he was abandoning Alexandra. 

Her assistant held out her phone. ""Ms. Clayton, look at this.""

Just half an hour earlier, Caiden had rented every LED billboard in the city to confess his love for Leyla. 

""Leyla Morrison, I love you.""

Those words burned Alexandra's eyes. 

Once, Caiden had gone to similar lengths to profess his love for Alexandra. 

He had said, ""In this world, you're the only one worth this kind of effort.""

Back then, everyone envied Alexandra for choosing the right man. 

She gave a bitter smile. 

""Ms. Clayton!"" her assistant exclaimed suddenly, her voice bright. ""The lab just sent word. They've decoded the toxin's molecular structure. With this, they'll likely develop an antidote soon. Mr. Fowler can be saved!""

Alexandra's heart skipped a beat, and she instinctively dialed Caiden's number. 

Before she could speak, a woman's low, sharp scream came through the phone. 

Then Caiden's voice, slightly breathless, answered. ""What is it?""

Alexandra gripped the phone tightly, her voice cold. ""Caiden, what are you doing?""

There was a pause on the other end. ""Alexandra, I told you not to bother me anymore,"" he said. 

The call ended. 

The mechanical busy tone filled her ears. She took a deep breath and redialed. 

But then she realized he had blocked her. 

Alexandra put the phone down. 

From Caiden and Leyla's history, it was clear. 

Caiden was a cold, calculating man. 

Now, facing death, he was willing to throw everything away. 

Alexandra wiped away the tears that had fallen unnoticed and gave a hollow laugh, her gaze settling on the man in her phone's wallpaper. 

Caiden Fowler. 

If he found out he wasn't going to die, would he still be so reckless? 

She would wait and see. 


Chapter 2
Caiden's public declaration of love for Leyla was anything but subtle. 

News of his infidelity spread like wildfire through their social circle. 

Alexandra's phone buzzed incessantly with calls. 

Her parents, who had been traveling abroad, and her older brother, who was away on business, rushed back home overnight. 

When Alexandra saw them, the tears she had held back all day finally fell. 

Josh Clayton, her brother, took one look at her and turned to leave. ""I'm going to settle this with Caiden right now!"" he said. 

Alexandra quickly stopped him. ""Josh, there's no need. Making a scene will only make it look like I can't let go.""

Josh's expression darkened, but he halted. 

""What's wrong with Caiden? Weren't you two happy together?"" he asked, turning back to her. 

Alexandra briefly recounted the story of Caiden and Leyla. 

Her father, furious, slammed his hand on the coffee table. ""Fine, just fine! I thought he was loyal, but I misjudged him!""

Alexandra gave a bitter smile. 

Hadn't she misjudged him too? 

The Clayton family was one of the most prominent in Glimon Province, and Alexandra, as the family's eldest daughter, was strikingly beautiful and exceptionally capable. 

Back then, her suitors could have lined up from the Clayton estate to ten miles beyond. 

Caiden had been one of them. 

At first, Alexandra was drawn to his looks, though not enough to consider marriage. 

But then she had a severe car accident, and while her other suitors panicked, Caiden tirelessly sought the best doctors for her. 

He stayed outside her hospital room for an entire week without rest. 

The day she was discharged, Alexandra ki**ed him and smiled. ""Caiden, let's get married.""

Looking back now, she realized his devotion likely had ulterior motives. 

Alexandra's lips twisted in self-mockery, her expression slowly hardening. 

If that was the case, she no longer wanted him. 

""By the way, Alex,"" Josh said, remembering something. ""Are you still attending the charity gala tomorrow?""

Alexandra let out a cold laugh. ""Why wouldn't I? I'm not the one who betrayed our marriage.""

The charity gala was a fundraising event for community development, attended by the city's elite. 

When Alexandra arrived, the event was already underway. 

Seeing her arrive alone, the crowd exchanged subtle glances. 

Some busybodies wanted to pry into whether she and Caiden were having issues, but her status kept them at bay. 

Her closer friends, sensing her reluctance to discuss it, acted as if nothing was wrong. ""Alex, come here,"" one said, pulling her over. 

Alexandra smiled and accepted a glass of champagne. 

A commotion stirred at the entrance. She turned to look. 

A woman in a blue mermaid gown walked in, arm in arm with Caiden. 

Alexandra's expression froze. 

Then she laughed. 

Well done, Caiden. Truly well done. 

The woman bore a striking resemblance to Alexandra, almost six parts identical. 

The esteemed eldest daughter of the Clayton family had been someone's stand-in for seven years! 

Her grip on the champagne flute nearly shattered it. 

But Alexandra refused to let others see her as a laughingstock. 

It took every ounce of self-control not to march over and slap Caiden. 

Caiden, as if oblivious to her presence, led Leyla to another corner of the room. 

After an awkward moment of silence, the gala resumed its lively hum. 

Her friends could no longer pretend nothing was wrong. 

""Alex, are you okay?"" one asked. 

""What's gotten into that j**k Caiden? I thought the rumors were false, but he's actually cheating!"" another said. 

Some tried to console her. 

""That mi**ress is clearly just a stand-in for you. Caiden's probably just chasing something new,"" one said. 

""Men are like that. Once he gets bored, he'll toss her aside,"" another added. 

""She's not a stand-in,"" a cold, deep voice interrupted from behind. 

Alexandra looked up to see Caiden standing there, his arm around a teary-eyed Leyla. 

Caiden, tall and imposing, carried an air of authority from years in power. 

In his navy suit, he seemed to command the room. 

His piercing gaze swept over the group, finally landing on Alexandra. He spoke slowly. ""I've always loved Leyla. Seven years ago, I did. And seven years later, I still do.""

The implication of who the real stand-in was hung in the air. 

Sympathetic glances turned toward Alexandra, more intense than before. 

Her nails dug into her palm. 

She thought his public declaration of love was the worst he could do. 

Yet he continued to trample her dignity in front of everyone. 

As if that wasn't enough, Caiden paused, then spoke again. ""Leyla isn't a mi**ress. I'm the one who pursued her relentlessly,"" he said. ""And here, I formally request a divorce from Alexandra Clayton, the eldest daughter of the Clayton family.""

The room erupted in gasps. 

Alexandra could no longer hold back. She stepped forward and slapped Caiden hard across the face. 


Chapter 3
Alexandra lost her composure in the end. 

Her hand trembled, and tears welled in her eyes. ""Caiden, you d**n ba**ard!"" she shouted. 

Caiden's face turned from the slap, and when he looked back, he froze. 

In his memory, he had never made Alexandra cry, but now he had. 

His tone softened slightly. ""I'm sorry, Alex. I don't want Leyla to suffer anymore,"" he said. 

Tears fell from Alexandra's eyes. 

She sneered, glaring at the man before her, each word deliberate. ""Caiden, this is the last time I'll cry for you.""

Caiden's heart jolted. ""Alex‚Ä¶""

""Miss Clayton, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to ruin your marriage,"" Leyla's voice interrupted. 

Alexandra's gaze shifted to Leyla, who clung to Caiden's arm. 

""Do you think you have the right to speak here?"" she asked coldly. 

Leyla's face paled. 

Alexandra's lips curled, her eyes dripping with scorn. ""Don't flatter yourself. Even without you, I'd still divorce Caiden.""

Leyla swayed, looking as if she might collapse. 

""Alexandra!"" Caiden's face darkened. 

Alexandra ignored him, turning to the crowd with a smile. 

In an instant, she seemed to reclaim her former pride and radiance as the Clayton heiress. 

""This was a private matter, and I didn't want to make a spectacle,"" she said loudly. ""But since Mr. Fowler has laid it all bare tonight, let everyone bear witness. No matter how much he regrets it later, the Clayton family will never let him set foot in our home again!""

The Clayton and Fowler families were the most prominent in Harbor City. 

No one dared interfere in their affairs. 

Silence fell, so heavy a pin could be heard dropping. 

Only Caiden's calm, cold voice echoed through the hall. ""I won't regret it,"" he said. 

He handed Alexandra a divorce agreement in front of everyone. 

Her expression barely flickered, but her smile grew sharper, her eyes colder. 

Caiden was doing this to defend Leyla. 

She didn't take his papers. Instead, she pulled another document from her bag. 

""Sorry, Mr. Fowler, but this is the one you should sign,"" she said. 

When Caiden saw the bold words ""leave with nothing"" on the agreement, he froze. 

He remembered signing this very agreement before their marriage. 

Alexandra had said, ""Caiden, our circle is full of fleeting relationships, but I want a lifelong partner. Can you promise that?""

Caiden had replied, ""Let's make a deal. Whoever betrays the marriage leaves with nothing.""

Alexandra had stared at him for a long time before smiling. ""Alright,"" she agreed. 

Now, Caiden was the one humiliated. 

But he didn't let the awkwardness linger. 

After a brief hesitation, he signed the document. 

Alexandra watched his every move. 

When the final st**ke fell, she closed her eyes. 

In that moment, Caiden was completely erased from her heart. 

The gala, which had begun as a fundraiser, ended with this dramatic scene. 

With the divorce, Alexandra gained a massive fortune. 

She waved a hand and donated two hundred million. 

The event shifted to casual mingling. 

Alexandra swirled a glass of red w**e slowly. 

She was exhausted, but as long as Caiden and Leyla remained, she couldn't leave first. 

Otherwise, tomorrow's gossip headlines would read, ""Fowler CEO attends event with new lover, Clayton heiress leaves alone in despair.""

""Miss Clayton, we really do look alike,"" a smiling voice said suddenly. 

Alexandra looked up to meet Leyla's bright, smug eyes. 

""You must know by now that Caiden always saw you as my substitute,"" Leyla added. 

The words stung like salt in a wound, and Alexandra's bl**d boiled. 

But her face remained calm. She raised an eyebrow. ""And?""

Leyla smiled. ""I'm just letting you know that Caiden has always loved me. You never meant anything to him.""

Alexandra's breath caught. 

Then she laughed, her gaze turning to pity as she looked down at Leyla. 

""Leyla, love is the cheapest thing there is. Haven't you learned that already? Oh, and I forgot to mention‚Äîthe antidote is almost ready. Do you think Caiden will stay with you once he knows he's not going to die?""

Leyla's pupils shrank. ""What did you say?"" she asked. 

Alexandra crossed her arms. ""What, disappointed?""

Leyla stared at her. 

After a moment, she shook her head. 

""No, of course I want him to live,"" she said. ""And I want him to stay with me forever. So‚Ä¶""

With that, Leyla stepped back, smiling, and fell into the pool behind her. 

A loud splash echoed as water sprayed everywhere. 

Caiden, hearing the noise, dove into the pool without hesitation. 

Alexandra watched coldly. 

When Caiden pulled Leyla out, he demanded, ""What happened?""

Leyla, shivering under a towel, said, ""It's my fault for upsetting Miss Clayton. If this helps her vent, I'm okay with it.""

Caiden's icy gaze shot to Alexandra. 

She said nothing. 

Before anyone could react, she kicked Leyla back into the pool. 

Grabbing a bucket of ice, she dumped it over Leyla's head and spoke coldly. ""No, this is how I vent.""


Chapter 4
Chaos erupted at the scene. 

Alexandra watched coldly, the frustration in her heart easing slightly. 

She grabbed her handbag and stormed out. 

When she returned home, someone suddenly threw her into the pool. 

A heavy hand pushed her underwater. 

Who was it? 

Fear gripped Alexandra's heart. 

She struggled desperately, but the hand holding her was like iron, unyielding. 

Just when she thought she would drown, she was pulled to the surface. 

Choking coughs tore through her as she gasped for air by the poolside. 

A pair of polished shoes appeared before her. 

Alexandra looked up into Caiden's cold, dark eyes. 

In that moment, she saw unmasked killing intent in his gaze. 

""Alex, Leyla is my line in the sand. You shouldn't have hurt her,"" he said. 

Caiden crouched beside her, wiping a tear from her cough-strained eyes. 

""Go spend a few hours in the freezer to reflect,"" he added. 

""Caiden!"" Alexandra screamed his name. 

He knew she had claustrophobia. 

But her terrified cries didn't sway him. 

Alexandra was roughly dragged into the freezer. 

As the heavy door slammed shut, cold air and darkness closed in. She curled up on the floor, laughing bitterly. 

Her smile was uglier than her tears. 

She and Caiden had been together not for seven days, but seven years. 

Seven years of love wasn't easy to let go. 

But in that moment, her lingering feelings for him vanished completely. 

Alexandra didn't know how long she was locked inside. 

When she woke, she saw Josh by her hospital bed. 

""Josh‚Ä¶"" she whispered. 

Josh touched her head gently. ""How do you feel?""

Alexandra gave a weak smile. ""I'm okay.""

She looked around. ""Where are Mom and Dad?""

Josh's face darkened. ""They went to the Fowler residence.""

From her brother, Alexandra learned she had fluid in her lungs, hypothermia, and severe frostbite. She had nearly died. 

Her father, furious, had gone with her mother to confront the Fowler family, demanding answers. 

""Caiden's been detained by the Fowler patriarch,"" Josh said. ""They're waiting for you to wake up before deciding what to do with him.""

When Alexandra felt stronger, Josh wheeled her to the Fowler residence. 

In the grand hall, Caiden knelt, bound tightly, with a trembling Leyla beside him. 

When Caiden saw Alexandra, he seemed shocked by her condition but said nothing. 

He turned to his father. 

""I did nothing wrong,"" Caiden said calmly, still kneeling. ""I don't regret any choice I've made.""

The Fowler patriarch's face turned ashen. 

Though both the Clayton and Fowler families were among Glimon Province's elite, the Claytons had deeper roots. 

The patriarch didn't want to lose this alliance. 

He had made Caiden kneel to appease the Claytons and to dissuade him from divorcing Alexandra. 

But Caiden continued. ""I have less than five days left. I just want to live for myself,"" he said. 

Leyla suddenly dropped to her knees before Alexandra. ""Miss Clayton, please, I've waited for Caiden for seven years. I just want to be with him for his final days. Please don't make this harder for us,"" she pleaded. 

Alexandra nearly laughed, feeling like the villain in their story. 

She ignored Leyla and met Caiden's eyes. ""Caiden, have you ever considered you might not die?"" she asked. 

Caiden froze, then smirked. ""They haven't found an antidote in three months. What chance do I have?""

He had checked every source that day, and the answers were still hopeless. 

Alexandra began, ""The Clayton lab‚Ä¶""

Caiden cut her off impatiently. ""Enough, Alexandra. We've signed the divorce papers. No matter what you say, I'm not coming back to you,"" he said. 

He paused. ""I've decided to marry Leyla.""

Before Alexandra could respond, the Fowler patriarch slammed the table. ""If that's your choice, you're stripped of your position as company president, expelled from the Fowler family, and denied burial in our ancestral graveyard!""

Caiden's face paled. ""Father!"" he protested. 

The patriarch turned away. 

After a long pause, Caiden gritted his teeth. ""Fine, I accept!""

The patriarch's face grew darker. He raised a hand. ""Take him to the underground arena.""

The Fowler family had risen from gang roots, retaining some old traditions. 

Family members who committed grave errors were injected with muscle relaxants and sent to the family's underground arena for three fights. 

Their survival was their own responsibility. 

In the first match, Caiden broke an arm and three ribs but didn't back down. 

As bl**d spilled on the stage, Leyla, now standing beside Alexandra, whispered, ""Miss Clayton, do you see? He's willing to die for me.""

Alexandra said nothing. 

She believed Caiden loved Leyla. 

But she also knew he loved himself more. 

His recklessness stemmed from believing he was dying. 

If he survived, regret and collapse would follow. 

Just then, Alexandra's phone buzzed. ""Ms. Clayton, the antidote has been successfully developed!""

Alexandra gave a faint smile. 

It would make a fine wedding gift for Caiden. 


Chapter 5
Besides the Clayton family, Leyla stood closest to Alexandra. 

She overheard every word of the phone call. 

Leyla froze, staring at Alexandra in shock. 

She hadn't expected Alexandra to actually develop the antidote. 

Rather than joy, fear consumed her. 

Leyla knew better than anyone how ruthless Caiden could be. 

If he survived, his sweet promises to her would vanish like sm**e. 

Her face paled, and she bit her lip hard. 

In that moment, a twisted, obsessive glint flashed in her eyes. 

She would never let Caiden leave her again. 

Nor would she allow him to reconcile with Alexandra. 

Alexandra, focused on the call, missed the madness in Leyla's gaze. 

After hanging up, she looked toward the arena. 

Caiden's three matches had ended. 

As the heir who had triumphed in the Fowler family's brutal competitions, Caiden's strength was undeniable. 

He was the only one still standing after three fights. 

Bloodied and battered, he carried an air of unyielding dominance. 

His eyes, still burning with intent, swept the crowd. 

They landed on on Alexandra. ""Satisfied?"" he asked. 

Their eyes met, but Alexandra's face remained cold. She said nothing. 

She had nothing left to say to Caiden. 

His gaze softened as it shifted to Leyla. 

""Let's go,"" he said, extending a hand to her. 

From start to finish, he didn't spare Alexandra another glance. 

Despite the Clayton and Fowler families standing up for her, everyone felt Alexandra had lost. 

Her expression was icy. 

As Caiden left, she silently turned her wheelchair and departed the Fowler residences. 

Once, she might have felt anger or sorrow, but now her heart was calm. 

She thought this would be her last encounter with Caiden. 

In a few days, after delivering that gift, she would be done with him forever. 

Leaving the Fowler residence, Alexandra had Josh take her to an upscale sanatorium. 

In the top-floor VIP room 303, she donned a sterile gown and wheeled herself in. 

A boy, about five or six, lay on the bed, his face rosy but unconscious. 

Alexandra touched his cheek gently. ""Little Treasure, have you been okay these past few days?"" she whispered. 

After a pause, she continued, ""Today, I came to tell you that your father and I‚Ä¶""

Her voice broke. Even in front of her child, she couldn't hide her emotions. 

Seven years was too long. 

Cutting Caiden out of her heart felt like tearing out a piece of her flesh. 

No matter how composed she appeared, the pain was bone-deep. 

Alexandra sniffed, then continued, ""‚Ä¶are divorced. But don't worry, he didn't fight for you. I'll make sure‚Ä¶""

Her phone buzzed, interrupting her. 

Caiden's hoarse, cold voice came through, still raw from his injuries. ""Alexandra, I warned you. Leyla is my line in the sand. You shouldn't have touched her,"" he said. 

Alexandra frowned. ""What did I do to her?""

Caiden's tone grew colder. ""You've been slandering her online. It seems last time's lesson didn't sink in,"" he said. 

Alexandra's face darkened. ""I didn't‚Ä¶""

But Caiden had already hung up. 

She searched Leyla's name online. The screen filled with trending posts about Leyla being a homewrecker. 

Within minutes, as Alexandra scrolled, the posts vanished. 

Then a new headline surged to the top. ""Clayton Heiress Caught Cheating.""

A bad feeling gripped Alexandra. 

She clicked the post. 

A video appeared, showing her in b*d with a man having s*x. 

The setting was her and Caiden's home. 

But the man wasn't Caiden. 

Her pupils constricted. 

She hadn't expected Caiden to stoop so low as to fabricate a video to ruin her for Leyla's sake. 

Josh strode in, his voice grave. ""That video isn't fake!""

""What?"" Alexandra's face drained of color, her eyes trembling with disbelief. 

Who was the man in the video? 

Why had she no memory of it? 

It felt like a bucket of ice water had been dumped over her. Her hand could barely hold the phone. 

Before she could process, another bombshell hit the trending list. ""Fowler Heir Not Caiden's Son‚ÄîClayton Heiress's Illegitimate Child.""

Caiden had personally released a paternity test proving their son wasn't his. 

Alexandra felt cold from head to toe. 

Even when she learned of Caiden's af**ir and realized she'd been a substitute, she hadn't lost control like this. 

She rushed to the hospital where Caiden was recovering, her lips trembling. ""What's with that video?""

Caiden stared at her, expressionless. 

""I needed an heir,"" he said. ""But I'd never let any woman but Leyla bear my child.""

Those two sentences revealed a horrifying, sordid truth. 

To secure an heir, Caiden had dr**ged Alexandra and arranged for another man to sl**p with her. 

Now, he'd turned his vile actions into a weapon to defend Leyla, plunging a knife into Alexandra's heart without mercy. 

In that moment, Alexandra looked at Caiden. 

She had thought their love was gone, that parting ways was the best outcome. 

But now, hatred filled her heart. 


Chapter 6
Josh, who had followed his sister, couldn't hold back and punched Caiden in the face. 

""You animal!"" he shouted. 

Caiden's head snapped to the side from the blow. 

As Josh raised his fist again, bodyguards rushed in and pulled him back. 

Caiden wiped the bl**d from his mouth and looked at Alexandra. 

""This was supposed to stay a secret,"" he said. ""You forced my hand.""

Alexandra didn't bother defending herself. She sat in her wheelchair, staring coldly at Caiden. 

After a long silence, she spoke. ""Caiden, I hope you never regret this.""

When Caiden met her gaze, he noticed the change in her eyes. 

Those beautiful eyes, once full of warmth, now held only coldness and hatred. 

His icy expression faltered for a moment. 

In that brief moment of his unease, Alexandra turned and left. 

Leyla chased after her, blocking her path. ""Miss Clayton,"" she said. 

Alexandra looked at her. ""You're quite cunning,"" she remarked. 

Leyla smiled. ""It worked, didn't it? You seem to hate Caiden now. Let me tell you another secret.""

She leaned closer. ""Your son's car accident was his doing.""

The words hit Alexandra like a thunderbolt. 

Her gaze sharpened as she stared at Leyla. ""You think I'd believe that?""

If Caiden needed an heir, why would he harm her son? 

Leyla's expression froze for a moment. 

Then she handed Alexandra a USB drive. ""This has recordings of him arranging the accident.""

Back home, Alexandra reviewed the contents of the drive. Her bl**d ran cold. 

Leyla had told the truth. 

Her son was only four when the accident happened. 

How could Caiden be so heartless? Wasn't he the one who wanted an heir? 

Josh, furious, struggled to control his emotions. ""When you confronted Caiden at the hospital, didn't you secretly record it? I'll have it released now,"" he said. 

Alexandra, eyes red, stopped him. 

The truth stabbed at her like countless knives. 

Though her body trembled with pain, she swallowed the taste of bl**d in her mouth. 

""Josh,"" she said hoarsely, ""not yet. Wait until he marries Leyla.""

Then, she would deliver the most devastating blow to Caiden. 

Meanwhile, across the ocean in a sprawling estate, a butler hurriedly pushed open a wooden door to report to the man inside. 

""Young master, we've found the woman you were involved with years ago,"" he said. 

The man on the sofa looked up. ""Who?""

""Alexandra, the heiress of the Clayton Group.""

The man raised an eyebrow, surprised. ""My sister-in-law?""

The butler nodded. ""And it's possible you have a child with her.""

The man froze, then glanced at the rain outside the window. He stood and gave instructions. ""Then I'm returning to the country.""

Since the scandal of Alexandra's alleged af**ir broke, the Clayton Group lost billions overnight. 

Gossip reporters swarmed the Clayton estate like flies. 

Online, vitriol flooded Alexandra's social media accounts. 

""She cheated first and then blamed Caiden for his af**ir. How shameless!""

""Clayton heiress can't get enough? Look at me instead.""

""Up for a fling? You looked wild in that video.""

... 

Alexandra watched the escalating rumors coldly. 

She knew the public loved a scandal. 

The uproar was so massive because Caiden was fanning the flames behind the scenes. 

But she didn't stop it. 

The bigger the storm, the worse the backlash would be. 

She waited for the day Caiden would face the consequences. 

A day passed, leaving Caiden with only four days. 

He seemed determined to fulfill his regrets in the time he had left. 

On the fourth day, he posted a photo of him and Leyla ki**ing under the stars on a snowy mountain. 

On the third day, he held Leyla's hand on a Ferris wheel, vowing never to betray her. 

On the second day, he arranged a grand fireworks display for her. 

On the final day, Caiden and Leyla's wedding arrived. 

The ceremony took place at a villa owned by Caiden. 

Having offended the Claytons and been disowned by the Fowlers, he had few guests to invite. 

Still, Caiden ensured Leyla had a lavish, grand wedding. 

As the wedding march played, Caiden and Leyla walked hand in hand into the hall. 

Caiden wasn't truly happy. 

It was his wedding day, but also his last day alive. 

He could feel the suppressant failing, pain gnawing at his lungs. 

Yet he pushed forward to the altar. 

He had to give Leyla a perfect wedding. 

The officiant smiled at him. ""On this beautiful day, Mr. Caiden Fowler, do you take Miss Leyla Morrison to be your wife, to‚Ä¶""

As the words continued, Caiden's mind drifted to his wedding with Alexandra. 

Back then, the Clayton heiress had been radiant, like a rose ready to bloom. 

""Caiden, I'm not promising you forever. If you ever mistreat me, I'll leave you,"" she had said. 

Caiden's thoughts wandered. 

""Caiden?"" Leyla tugged at his sleeve. 

He snapped back. ""I do,"" he said. 

Just then, a group strode in from outside. 

The leader announced loudly, ""The Clayton heiress has come to present a wedding gift.""

Caiden frowned, about to speak, when the man opened a black metal case and held it forward. ""Mr. Fowler, the antidote to the poison in your body is here. Congratulations.""

Caiden froze, staring at the pale blue syringe. 

His reaction wasn't joy. 

His expression slowly hardened.
