You might think a paperclip is just a paperclip or a coffee filter is only for coffee, but oh no, my friend. Your everyday household items are secret MVPs with hidden talents. 

Here’s a list of 10 unique ways to turn the ordinary into the extraordinary. Prepare to see your junk drawer in a whole new light! 👇

# 1. Hairdryer: The Sticker Whisperer 💨

Got a stubborn price tag or sticker that just won’t peel? Blast it with a hairdryer for 30 seconds and watch it surrender. The heat loosens the adhesive, making it peel off like magic. Who knew your hair tool could moonlight as a label assassin?

# 2. Coffee Filters: The Anti-Grease Hero ☕

Out of napkins? Use a coffee filter to blot greasy pizza or bacon. It’s the perfect grease catcher and keeps your fingers *somewhat* clean while you devour your third slice.

# 3. Rubber Bands: The Jar Opener Extraordinaire 🫙

Struggling with a jar lid? Wrap a rubber band around the edge for extra grip, and voilà! Instant strength upgrade. You’ll feel like a kitchen superhero.

# 4. Pool Noodles: The Car Door Protector 🚗

Cut a pool noodle in half lengthwise and stick it on your garage wall. Now, when you fling your car door open, it’ll hit the noodle instead of the wall. Bonus: no more dent rage.

# 5. Toothpaste: Jewelry Sparkle Potion 💎

That toothpaste you trust with your pearly whites can also shine up your jewelry. Rub a small amount on dull rings or necklaces, rinse, and sparkle like it’s 1999. (Skip this hack for anything antique or precious, though—just in case!)

# 6. Binder Clips: The Perfect Cable Tamer 🔌

Tired of cords looking like a spaghetti pile? Clip a few binder clips to the edge of your desk, thread your cables through, and boom—organization level unlocked.

# 7. Ice Cube Tray: The Mini Meal Prep Master ❄️

Freeze leftover sauces, herbs, or even tiny portions of soup in an ice cube tray. Next time you’re cooking, just pop out a cube and level up your dish. Culinary genius? That’s you.

# 8. Tennis Balls: Floor Protector Pro 🎾

Cut a small slit into a tennis ball and slip it onto the legs of your chairs. No more screeching sounds when you move furniture—and your floors will thank you.

# 9. Lip Balm: The Zipper Savior 💄

Got a stuck zipper? Rub a little lip balm on the teeth, zip it up and down a few times, and it’ll glide like butter. Bonus: Your jacket will smell faintly of vanilla.

# 10. Muffin Tin: The Ultimate Snack Organizer 🧁

Hosting a movie night? Use a muffin tin to serve snacks like popcorn, candies, and chips. It’s like a DIY charcuterie board for junk food, and everyone gets their own sampler tray.

✨ **Pro Tip:** Everyday items are like that quiet coworker who secretly knows *everything*—you just need to ask the right questions. So go ahead, think outside the box (or in this case, the coffee filter).

What’s your favorite unconventional hack? 

Share your genius below and let’s turn life into one big, quirky problem-solving party! 🎉

1hrb6q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchoolAdvice/comments/1hrb6q2/im_deciding_to_postpone_grad_school_for_a_year_am/,"I’m deciding to postpone grad school for a year, am I making a good decision? ","I (23F) finished my undergrad a year ago, and I’m currently doing an internship with the provincial legislature in my province in Canada. My career goals are to work in the provincial or federal public service in some kind of policy or coordinator role. Eventually, I want to get my PHD to continue the research I’ve been doing. For the past year, I’ve been debating between a Masters of Public Health or a Masters of Public Policy & Administration. 

I recently came to the very scary conclusion that I’d wait another year and do my masters in Fall 2026, as opposed to Fall 2025. I love academia and research, so this decision has been really hard for me to grapple with. I feel like I’m behind in comparison to my peers and that I may be wasting my time.

My reasoning to delay my masters is primarily financial; my top choice school is in another city but isn’t covered by student loans. I’d need to take a year to work and save up for tuition and living expenses. 

As well, I feel remiss going into my masters with the level of confusion I have now. I don’t know if the MPH or MPP route is better, despite doing lots of research and coffee chats with industry professional. I think taking the year to work in a full-time, public service position related to public health or policy will provide me with better clarity on which masters aligns best with my goals. 

Ultimately, being out of school is a “risk” that I want to take, as committing myself fully to my professional career outside of school is something I’ve never done. 

Do you have any advice for me? Do you think I’m making a wise decision? What does your grad school career path look like? 

Thank you for your advice and happy new year :)

1hrb5md,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mediums/comments/1hrb5md/weird_synchronicities_with_my_automatic_writing/,Weird synchronicities with my automatic writing,"I've been doing automatic writing for a few months and I found that it has been well a bit successful. I've trained with strangers online trying to communicate with their loved ones and I would always find out about a core memory they had with them. Now I'm not sure that means that the spirit was there, I personally don't believe so, I feel it's like a sort of psychic session. But sometimes I do it for myself and I ask my spirit guide for advice. Last year it told me to cry, and I was confused by it, but at some point in my life I felt so angry and I thought about this advice, so i locked myself in a room and cried for hours. I did that for a week and whenever i felt this urge to cry I just would let myself do it. I feel it has saved me, it seemed so simple and yet it has cleansed something so deep in my soul and gave me a new motivation to start over. So i felt like this writing thing is starting to feel a bit ""real"" so to speak.

But I want to talk about synchronicities.

In one of my writing, I thought I would try to channel Marilyn Monroe's spirit, and that's just to train, I didn't think anything of it, again I just kind of experiment with everything right now. But I got the word ""Leon"", and couple days later I went to New York, and I booked a hotel and right in front of my window was another building, and on it there was a sort of marking, probably a vintage one that was there in maybe the 50s or someting, on it was written ""Leon"". 

I thought nothing of it then, I thought it could be a coincidence.

But recently I wrote ""Iris"" in one of my automatic writing session, I went to visit another city and I saw Iris posters, seemed to be a movie being promoted, then walked past a hotel called Iris. And I went to a coffee shop and the song ""Iris"" started to play by Goo Goo Dolls.

A couple days ago, I did another writing for myself, just because I lit up a candle in my room and the fire went all over place, kind of violently, and I have an automatic small light, that only lits up if you walk past it; It kept lighting up out of nowhere, when no one is walking past it at all. I thought, what the hell, Ill just do a session. And in it I had typical kind of metaphorical interesting words, but then i started writing Plato. Over and over. Plato Plato Plato Plato. I thought it could be about the Greek Philosopher, so I thought to myself I will just read about him at some point. But the next day, something interesting happened again. I saved a Youtube video for weeks and I decided to play it, on the title it was more talking about Howard Stern, but when I watched the video, the person was talking about Howard Stern interviewing Dana PLATO. I'm like wait a minute, I wrote that yesterday and I have no idea who this lady is. I started reading about her but I don't know why it matters or it's relevant to anything? And I thought could it be just again, some kind of synchronicity? They keep happening to the point I don't think this is random anymore.

And for the last thing, I created a spotify playlist for myself for a story I'm working on, and i kind of abandoned it, and always felt just so insecure about writing, and being ""good"" at it but today I woke up and the radio was on cause someone in my house plays it every morning and it's a song I would always listen to while writing my story and that i consider THE song of the story. Just was interesting as well.",1,1735761856.0,Mediums,0,1.0,False

I'd like to use one of the wider pieces to make a coffee table to replace the 2x4 & plywood one I made a few years ago.

Looking for someone with more Seiko knowledge than I seem to have to help me ID the bracelet reference for these links. I don't *think?* they are SKX, I just needed to post a reference. I was told they were GS, but I have scoured all GS bracelets for something similar and just haven't found anything. They do look similar to what you'd see on some SKX's, however the side pieces are two piece, with the end polished out, They measure 17mm wide, which isn't out of the realm for the adjustable links part of the bracelet that are within the taper like most Seiko's have. Also throwing me off are the screw holes which are centered on the link, when all that I have seen show holes that forward (or rearward), so I'm at a loss. Maybe starting to think that they're not even Seiko. I'll Venmo coffee money for a positive I.D. Thanks.

I've been gf for like 15 years, so I have that part nailed down :) I'm scared about making the vegan part work tho. Mostly bc of medical issues and money.

The thing is I'm EXTREMELY poor -- on disability with 3 ravenous teenagers. Food stamps are not a lot to live on. I struggle to make them feel full without huge quantities of pasta or rice etc. and I want to supply them with good nutrients. I can't afford to buy a bunch of new cookbooks. (I'm slowly trying to use up the meat I do have and replace it.) For a long time I've avoided going vegetarian/vegan bc the replacements are so expensive. Then recently I realized oh duh I can make it myself at home for cheap!

I have gastroparesis and I can't eat beans, oatmeal, or broccoli or too much anything that slows my digestion down. (My kiddos can tho.) We eat a lot of Asian food which is rice, tofu, and veg heavy and thats already gf so I've got that at least. But without beans it seems hard to go vegan?

One solution I haven't figured out is coffee. We are Korean and I always buy the big boxes of Maxim instant sticks and it's so cheap and so easy. Idk how to replace this resource? It comes with creamer so that's the big sticking point. I can switch to tthe one that doesn't have creamer but I have to replace it. I like Laird creamer but it's so expensive and for some reason always out of stock. My kiddos think it tastes weird.

Ive also never made mandu (gyoza, dumplings) both gf and dairy free so any advice there would be appreciated.

I have a brain injury and thinking can sometimes be a struggle so I'm sorry if this seems like a dumb question to have. I'm worried about learning a whole new way to cook when learning anything is hard. I know I should put in the time to read all the past posts n stuff but it gets so overwhelming to me.

I'm hoping to have a conversation here of good resources or go to recipes that could help me out. Anyone want to chime in anything?

PS I just realized it's new year time and I guess a lot of people are going to be showing up for a brief time and not sticking to it. This is not a resolution thing it's just a coincidence that my medical issues have finally driven me to. Sigh.

PPS I just made gf and vegan tacos with TVP and it was so wonderfully good and cheap. But we really missed the cheese or crema. Avocado is expensive so any ideas besides that for the creamy topping? Maybe plain coconut yogurt or something?

As a MTG card player, I recently came across a 3D printed card scanner that allows you to slide in a card, and it gets scanned for an app that highlights the price.  Is there anything like this for coins?   Where you could slide them in and have a camera scan them for value, rather than checking each one against a “valuable” list?

* When I was a missionary, Jesus Christ made a rule against giving away money to impoverished children.
* The Savior threatened to not help me find the people who needed his help if I failed to wake up exactly on time.
* Jesus Christ repeatedly calls sexual predators to positions of trust and power.
* Jesus Christ was happy about the results of the Bisee Arizona case.
* Jesus Christ doesn't want to pay for background checks for people who work with children unless it's a legal requirement.
* The Savior set hires lawyers to protect his good name—even if it ends up hurting people who have already been victimized.
* Jesus Christ thinks women will be the most happy when completely financially dependant on their husbands.
* The Lord is more upset when people have consensual sex outside of marriage than when a person gets raped by their spouse.
* Jesus Christ asks me to clean his house for free every Saturday.
* The Savior of the World is very concerned what kind of underwear I wear.
* The Lord threatens to keep my away from my family for the rest of eternity if I drink coffee.
* Jesus Christ decided to let black people into heaven in 1978.
* Jesus Christ decided I don't need to covenant to obey my husband in 2019.
* The Savior continually says he'll be back soon—just to keep me on my toes.
* Jesus Christ *really* doesn't want two loving adults to be allowed to be married if they both have the same kind of genitalia.
* The Lord lied to the US government for over 20 years so that no one would know how much money he had.
* The Savior of mankind demands money from impoverished people. Sometimes he called it 'fire insurance.'
* Jesus Christ has a multi-billion dollar stock portfolio.

1hrayo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/comments/1hrayo1/too_much_energy_anxiety/,Too much energy/ anxiety ,"Looking for some guidance.  I started trt in October. Total was 300 and free t was very low at 2.8 and estradiol at 24. 

Doc started me on 160mg injecting .20mg 4 days a week. 8 week bloodworked showed total test at 1234, free at 24.1 and estradiol at 67. Told do I felt like a new man but he wanted me to try .25mg of anastrozole once a week to see if I felt any better.

I took .25mg anastrozole on Wednesday the week before last, and .25mg last Wednesday. After taking it last Wednesday, that Thursday and Friday was concerning. I don't know if I would call it anxiety, more like I had way too much energy. Like I had been taking speed or had drank 20 cups of coffee. Real jittery and couldn't sleep. Didn't get to sleep until 2 or 3 am both nights.

I don't injecting Saturday or Sunday and felt much better.  Monday morning, I did my injection and felt the same jittery energy and insomnia. Skipped my injection yesterday and haven't injected today and the jittery feeling isn't as bad.

If my estradiol was at 67, could .25mg anastrozole once a week for two weeks crash my estradiol giving me this feeling? Or, my total being at 1234, could less aromatase to estradiol from taking the anastrozole be raising my test too high causing the excess energy and jittery feeling? Maybe I need to lower my dose and quit taking the anastrozole? Waiting for doc to get back with me.

Thanks for any insight.

1hrax8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1hrax8b/clownitis_klownitis/,CLOWNITIS (Klown-I-tis),"Walking through his front door, Henry called for his mother. Eerie silence is all he got in response, so he slowly and mindfully closed the door believing her to be napping. Still, an uneasy feeling boiled in his stomach, especially with the outbreak of the disease known as “Clownitis” spreading wildly in an unpredictable pattern.

This disease turned ordinary people into twisted iterations of clowns. If contracted the disease would enact an over production of melanin causing large unnatural brown or black shapes to form on the face resembling clown makeup. People with darker complexions would instead suffer from a vitiligo like whitening of their skin, turning their complexion a stark white with patches of their original skin tone resembling clown makeup. Their eyes held malice and their teeth would somehow double in length and width stretching the lips into twitchy, involuntary smiles. They would laugh in an over the top, animated clown laugh and did so sporadically. In addition to the outer changes were the changes within. The ghastly grinners regressed into a feral state unlocking a primal predator instinct that enhanced their speed and stamina. The horrific jokers were great hunters, preying on animals and humans alike. While feasting on the flesh of their victims they would ask (no one in particular) “Does this meat taste funny to you?” Unsettling as all that may sound it only gets worse, should the victim somehow survive the ordeal then in a day’s time they too would become infected and change into a grotesque clown.

Knowing all this the nine year old cautiously moved deeper into the house trying to be as quiet as he could. Rounding the kitchen corner, his mind started to run wild with thoughts of his mother transformed and waiting for him with a knife. To his relief he was in the clear, but he did notice light brown hairs scattered around the kitchen floor and counter top. Sprinkles of crusted blood trailed from the counter, across the floor and leading into the dining area. His pulse quickened and he unknowingly held his breathe. As he inched his way to the dining room, he told himself internally to turn and runaway; yet he still moved forward.

Reaching the doorway he gently gripped the wood and slowly he took a peek inside. His mother was sitting at the table with her back to him enjoying a meal.

“Hi son!” she said. Aside from her hair looking greasy she seemed normal, nothing else was out of place. Henry replied with hi and he felt the tension leave his body in slow pulsating waves. Feeling confident that his mother was normal he asked her why there was hair in the kitchen and what the red drips were. To which she simply replied, “Does this meat taste funny to you?” The boys fear returned instantly and arose with a heat like a wildfire. His mother turned to face him, Henry’s adrenaline made her movements seem slow, revealing her “CLOWNSFORMATION.” The boy’s legs gave out at the sight. He couldn’t believe it, his mother had been “CLOWNSFORMED” into a card carrying member of the Insane Clown Posse.

Her lips stretched thin over her newly enlarged, blood stained teeth. So thin that her skin had split open in random spots to allow her to create the widest smile he’d ever witnessed. Looking at the table he saw the scraps of his guinea pig, looking back to his mother he saw one of the guinea pigs arms twitching in between two of her box like teeth. The boy’s primal instincts for survival propelled him to his feet and he made a mad dash for the front door, exiting the dining area the same way he came. His mother started laughing wildly and loud. Henry reached the door and unlocked it. As he turned the knob he heard the chair his mother sat upon smack hard on the tile floor. The boy turned to look and saw his mother exit the dining room rapidly through the other door then jump over the back of the couch in the front room followed by a midair front flip that cleared the front of the couch. She landed a perfect dismount on top of the coffee table in the front room breaking through it with bare feet. The broken and splintered wood digging, jabbing and embedding itself in the bottoms of her feet, in between her toes and under her toe nails. The tears of a clown flooded her eyes with the pain she felt showing the boy that the infected were not completely mindless, although he didn’t understand the significance.

Her upper and lower mandibles spread open wide and expelled more loud laughter. Then while using over exaggerated steps she began to mime her way out of an invisible knee high barrier. Henry swung the door open and ran outside, his mother giving chase. She was only two steps behind him when the boy made a sharp right toward the driveway. Her body continued moving forward although she turned her head to face him. She pivoted her body and quickly changed direction, running again toward the boy. Henry had crossed the driveway and his mother was three steps in to her new direction when the boy’s stepfather drove up unexpectedly, hitting the 5’ 2” woman at a speed of seven miles per hour.

The impact bounced the woman off the front of the vehicle, her body making a horn sound when the two collided. She flew up in the sky and crashed onto the trash bins in front of the house, knocking them over and spilling the smelly contents inside. Quickly hopping out of his car, Henry’s stepdad popped open the trunk and opened a pack of zip ties he had just purchased.

### Adrian Carmody

*May 15, 2023 - October 30, 2039*

[Adrian Carmody](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/15pzh12/the_witch_twins_elias_and_adrian_carmody/) was a force of nature, and his impact was as radiant and far-reaching as the sun. He was quick with a kind word or joke, brightening every room he was in with laughter. He was a brilliant guitarist and thoughtful writer, sharing his love of music with the world through his curated playlists in the *Chronicle*. He was a skilled polymorph, adept weaver of textiles and magic, and proud child of Circe.

He was a hero, a dear brother, and a dear friend, and we will carry his memory with us always.

*Adrian Niall Carmody, 16, passed away in the Battle of New Argos. His [funeral](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1hisidb/time_to_say_goodbye_funeral_for_adrian_carmody/) was held in early December. He is survived by his twin brother, Elias Carmody, his father Darcy Carmody, his godly mother Lady Circe, his brother Salem Ashwood, and his partner Oliver Blackwell.*

# Battle of New Argos

The second round of the New Argos Games was interrupted by [a surprise attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1gcmn70/new_argos_round_two_interrupted/). Monsters and humans attempted to infiltrate the walled city of New Argos through [magic portals](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1gcmn70/comment/ltuw3q8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) established in the temple sof Hecate, Hebe, Circe, and Nike and [breaches in the city walls.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1gcmn70/comment/ltuy161/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) The portal invaders, dressed in blue and green robes and using a shared fireball power, caused severe destruction to the temples they occupied, as well as other adjacent temples. Hyperborean giants and other monsters swarmed the streets and climbed the stone walls. Anonymous campers report that these monsters described their role in the conflict as creators of chaos and distraction. [Later communication from Queen Anastasia](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1hftn4z/the_battle_of_new_argos_the_aftermath/) revealed that a small group of invaders used underground tunnels to enter the palace, killing three council members and taking documents from the palace library.

The leaders of this attack have not yet identified themselves, nor did they provide a manifesto or motive to any of their adversaries. ""They didn’t care if they lived or died,"" Arete Sideris, counselor of the Enforcers (Cabin #17) recalled. ""They wanted it to be meaningless."" The only calling card they left was a blue rhombus symbol. We await more information from the city and from camp staff as they investigate the nature of this incident. Until then, as demigods and heroes, we provide aid to the still-rebuilding, mourn the lives lost, and commit ourselves to action.

* We saw the return of [Secret Santa](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1hbahj1/1012_secret_santa_2039_signups/) this year, led once more by Brent Carter, counsellor of the Oneiroi cabin. Numerous posters advertised the event, and campers were encouraged to submit their name and interests in a wooden mailbox posted in the pavilion. The gift-giving will commence [soon after Christmas.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1hnnw6c/2712_secret_santa_2039/)
* Campers report that Lucy Arkwright and Jules Verma-Morgan publicly declared their love for each other in the middle of the dining pavilion in late November. Neither Arkwright or Verma-Morgan responded to any requests for comment from our team.

### Winter Weather Report
*by [Robert Bridger](/u/SparkyBirb)*

As always we start the new year with winter, or if you’re from the opposite side of the planet this would be summertime for you. After a year of soft spring days, dry summer evenings, and wet fall mornings, it’s now up to Boreas to come up with exciting weather events for us. Happy New Year and welcome to the first weather report of the year.

January will start off cold and snowy, with averages between 36 and 26 degrees Fahrenheit. Expect some more snowfall, averages in New York range up to 1.57 inches of snow. We can also expect some light rainfall. February remains a cold month, with temperatures as low as 27 degrees. This month we’ll also likely see more snow- and rainfall. Prepare yourself for snowball fights! When February ends, we’ll likely see a warming trend, with temperatures reaching up to 50 degrees. Rainfall is more common in March.
 
Fun Weather Fact of the Season: If you’re lucky this winter you might see Diamond dust. Though it’s most common in polar regions, it also happens away from it. Diamond dust are ground-level clouds composed of tiny ice crystals. It looks like snowfall, but it actually isn’t!

### Toby’s Terrific Tales 
*by [Toby Eversfield] (/u/TheMagePriest/)*

For this edition of the Chronicle to mark the autumnal season and that winter is fast approaching with Christmas around the corner, this article will be reviewing A Christmas Carol written by Charles Dickens. First of all, I recommend for anyone who is dyslexic or struggles with reading or general to find a copy written in modern English as opposed to the traditional Victorian English that it is written in. If you want to know the story but want to avoid reading it yourself there is an animated version with Jim Carey as Scrooge to watch which would be highly recommended.


Whether you realise it or not this story asks some huge fundamental questions that are relatable to us Greek demigods, an example - Can your fate be changed? The story focuses on a grumpy old man called Ebenezer Scrooge, who is obsessed with the hoarding of wealth and has become selfish and socially isolated due to his greed. But, can he be changed? His old recently deceased business partner hopes so as he returns from beyond the grave to warn him about the fate he shall receive in the afterlife if he doesn’t change his ways.


Across the story you shall see Scrooge’s past, why he hates Christmas and get an insight into what a Victorian Christmas used to be like. At times heartbreaking, other times heartwarming and others chilling. It is a great mix for those who enjoy a Christmas story but maybe still linger for the already-gone Halloween. It is well worth a read and a copy can be found in the Athena Cabin library for anyone who wants to read it.


On a personal note - Merry Christmas to all readers of the Chronicle.

### Ghosts of the Season
*by [Aoife Hawthorn] (/u/Aoife_Hawthorn/)*

Happy Christmas, Yule, Hanukkah, or anything else to those who celebrate! 
We can all agree that ghosts are objectively cool, right? The dead returning back to this mortal plane out of  the longing to finish their unfinished business is just so interesting, but maybe that’s just my Melinoe kid showing. So as we approach the winter season, riding on the coattails of Halloween, let’s look at a really cool Folkloric and ghostly(™) phenomenon known as the Wild Hunt. 

Stories of the wild hunt vary based on who’s telling them and where, but it’s always a spectral hunt led by some form of mythological figure. The members of this hunt can be anything from the souls of the dead to fairies to Valkyries, and its purpose was anything from bringing blessings and welfare, to kidnapping sleeping souls and giving them to the fae. Essentially the Wild Hunt is whatever you want it to be, so long as it’s a ghostly hunt across the sky.
My personal favourite interpretation is that of the hunt consisting of the souls of the dead and being led by Holda (or Holle), though the image of Odin leading the hunt is also iconic. Other notable leaders include: Berchta, the Danish king Valdemar Atterdag, the Welsh psychopomp Gwyn ap Nudd, Theodoric the Great, biblical figures like Cain, Herod, the archangel Gabriel, or the Devil himself.

So the next time you’re out and about at night in the wintertime, make sure to look up to the sky in case you miss the Wild Hunt.
Until next time,
Aoife Hawthorn (resident Ghost nerd)

### QOTD: Does a cyclops wink or blink?

Cyclops are among the most infamous and most dangerous beings recorded in Ancient Greek mythology. Known for their monocular appearance, great strength, and forging acumen, these immortal giants can be found worldwide. Many of them are descended from Poseidon and can often be found working in his underwater forge.

While the Cyclops are of course the leading experts on their autonomic functions and cyclopean social cues, we polled the denizens of Camp Half-Blood to determine if the camp sees eye-to-eye on this matter.

#### With 13 out of 16 votes, Camp Half-Blood has decreed that a cyclops blinks.

*Vote Breakdown*

|Option|Number of Votes|Percentage|
|:----|----:|----:|
|Blink|13|81.3%|
|Wink|3|18.7%|

#### Blink

From Salem Ashwood:
> A wink is usually an act associated specifically with certain kinds of social behaviours. It indicates something, and is usually a voluntary movement. On the contrary to what's implied, I'd wager it'd be for a cyclops to actually wink, and it's likely they're not familiar with such a behaviour.

From Nova Martens:
> Blinking is instinctive, Winking is purposeful. Unless the cyclops is trying to wink then it's just blinking

From Juliet Edwards:
> Most of the time, I'd say they're blinking, 'cause they can't do it in the same way we do. I think they can do both, but winking requires more intent than just the number of eyelids closing. It's about the vibe behind it.

From Helia Bosley:
> They are still blinking all of their eyes. They cannot physically wink.

From Taylor Armstrong:
> You need two eyes to wink, and they are one eye short, so I say they can only blink... which is kinda sad, now that I think about it

+++++
#### Wink

From Adrian Carmody:
> You wink with just one eye, right? That's all they have! Therefore, they wink.

From a wise see-er:
> Winking is with one eye, and cyclops only have one eye.

#### Contemplations from Clay

I had an opportunity to [meet Clay](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1gvhjxv/cyclops_conversations_and_coffees/) through a Camp job when he was travelling through Montauk. While many Cyclops end up in antagonistic relationships with the demigod community, many also live relatively ordinary lives as forge workers and world travellers. Clay works in the underwater forges based in Poseidon’s kingdom. He likes candy, sweet drinks, and Halloween. 

While he was not willing to serve as the collective spokesperson for the entire race of Cyclops, he did mention that he found the tradition of winking to be “weird” and unfamiliar. Concepts of friendship and affinity are different among Cyclops, who live much of their lives alone. At the same time, he mentioned that they don’t often discuss the concept of blinking either. It seems that this distinction may be a matter of academic discussion, societal norms and language convention.

Does winking exist in other cultures, and does the message they communicate ever differ? Are there separate words for blinking and winking in other languages? Is the intent implicit in the definition of the word, or is it merely a description of a bodily function? These are the sort of secondary questions we seek the answer for, here at the Chronicle. Please let us know your thoughts!

### Anonymous Appreciations

A number of appreciators requested that their name was revealed, and this request was granted. If you care about someone, let them know.

For Arete Sideris:
> Congratulations on your leadership position. I wish you good luck. 
From Sasha Marszalek

For Avalon Fletcher:
> You’re pretty cool! 

For Bailey Rennes:
> You’re a great counsellor! Thank you for all that you do for the camp.

For Brent Carter:
Thank you for always being there when you're needed. Cabin 41 couldn't have asked for a better leader

For Brent Carter (again)
> Thank you for all your hard work with Secret Santa! We need joy and community more than ever.

For Elias Carmody:
> Good to see you not being so isolated anymore! Keep it up, Eli! 
From Adrian Carmody

For Friday Karalis:
> Thank you for being my friend.

For Maxwell Flammia:
> Hey, Maxie! Don't beat yourself up to much for what you couldn't do! Be proud of what you could do! And if you aren't, well... Know that your big brother is proud of you! 
From Taylor Armstrong

For Maxwell Flammia (again):
> You did your best, and that's all that matters. Everything you did as a leader was not in vain.

For Oliver Blackwell:
> I love you. Please stay the way you are.
From Adrian Carmody

For Vi Summers:
> Absolutely awesome individual! I had loads of fun with her at a certain karaoke party. She's just generally really cool, and I think she could do with a reminder of that fact :)

1hratfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Norwich/comments/1hratfl/moving_to_norwich_with_sen_kids/,Moving to Norwich with SEN kids,"Hi all! 
We have been in deep research mode on several areas of UK for pretty much whole of last year and have zoned in on Norwich as the place that appears to have all we feel is important to us - nature, good people, history, character, things to do with kids, and acceptable house prices. We are fully aware there is no utopia and every county, city and town has its things.

We have 3 kids. 8,5 and 4. One is diagnosed autistic and will need specialist provision. Another is going through assessment and will likely need some support in a mainstream school, likely Aspergers or along those lines.

We are aware of the uk SEN situation, postcode lottery, waiting times etc. we know it will be a fight no matter what we do. We know about EHCPs and processes. We currently live somewhere where specialist provision doesn’t actually exist and there is nothing to fight for, so please don’t reply with ‘i wouldn’t come here’. 🙂

What we want to know is:
- we will need to rent for a year or two, we will have a car and we do not need to be in the city centre but a 15/20 min drive is fine. Are there areas you would recommend? We like to go out for a walk, grab a coffee and a cake or go see some animals or whatnot with the kids. 
- we will eventually buy so if we don’t need to change areas post renting that would be a plus, but we’ve done crazier moves than one end of town to another so it’s not a huge deal. 
- Any SEN parents out there that may be open to having a chat at some point? We want to know about activities, schools, esp more towards the art sector, theatre and dance/performance, groups, meetups, horse riding…anything goes!
- We have looked at schools but if any really stand out in people’s minds as particularly lovely with SEN kids that would be good to hear. 

And I guess anything else that you might find to be relevant to know as a SEN parent or recommend as a good thing to look into and add to our list.

Apologies for the essay of a post, we have researched logistics etc but lived experience is so important so thank you in advance for anything you may be able to tell us.",2,1735760956.0,Norwich,5,0.75,False

1hrar44,https://www.reddit.com/r/SnarkyRecapsBySwiss/comments/1hrar44/jingles_31_jangles_jingers_arkansas_birthday/,Jingle’s 31 Jangles | Jinger’s Arkansas Birthday,"Hello, hello  Snarkers! As I started to get the vlog for Sage! and Beige!s Twinder/Jinder reveal post migraine level sinus headache, I saw Jingle had decided to get in on the action and post her birthday vlog. Someone got used to TLC giving every kid an episode for their birthday. With the J’Locust herd it was a way to guarantee non-stop events. It’s a brilliant move, honestly. The show wrote itself and always had a Birthday B-plot handy. As always with our Cali-branded housewife, she’s bringing in bigger 20 minute vlog.

A split second shot of Jingle walking with Jere-Maw through an airport as she says “we’re in Arkansas” then hugging J16 as she gets out of the driver’s seat to pick them up. The insipid “oh, yeah, oh yeaaah” clip of their distressed digital J&j logo lasts a merciful 3 seconds, followed by a yellowy glitch feature and a PowerPoint-esque text transition that says “Day 1 Arrived in Arkansas”. They arrive at the newly rented McBeardsley residence and greet Nostrils, OfNostrils, Giddy-Up, Austina and A.G. Luckily for the other J’Grands who’ve been seeing too much Aunt Jingle and not enough Publicitee and Privacee, they are along this trip and happily congregate with the other kids. Jere-Maw announces “the Birthday girl” is here after Jingle pops off an “OHHHH my WERD!”. Nostrils scratches a nipple as he makes eye contact with Jere-Maw, who is asking “how the man of the house is?” Nostrils says his ribs are sore, he thinks it’s manual labor. Jere-Maw says “yep” as he zooms in and out on Nostrils’ nostrils, the zoom outs revealing CinderJana and Prince Preaching in the kitchen. CinderJana bends over an oven as Prince Preaching stands around decorating the middle of the kitchen with his hands in his pockets. Jere-Maw does a couple more awkward AF zooms in and out before giving the rapid zoom treatment to his wife, to whom he tells “Happy Birthday”. The oldest of the children walk up, Giddy-Up and Austina flanking Publicitee who is holding a cake with one candle  to present to her mother. Jingle has her eyes closed and does a big gasp at the reveal and singing of Happy Birthday. Afterwards, Jingle relates the story of Giddy-Up giving his Aunt Jingle a candy cane from presumably his stocking. It was actually from Austina’s and in what is a brilliant parenting move, OfNostrils took a candy cane from his stocking to give to Austina. This move shook Giddy-Up to his core when it completely outflanked his sneaky little maneuver.

Bright pink neon text announces that it is officially Jingle’s Birthday. What has Jingle picked for her 31^(st) birthday? Top Golf. Sounds like she’s still liking what Jere-Maw likes. Jingle and OfNostrils exit the house into the sun as they squint against the brightness. Does God not like sunglasses in winter or are they just so committed to outdoors filming they just roll with it. Jere-Maw is staying behind with a slightly sick Privacee. Jingle climbs into a car to meet the rest of the J’Locusts for a bucket of balls since there isn’t room for her in the McBeardsley pickup. Wouldn’t there be enough room in that new Suburban? Jingle likely relishes the alone time as she drives herself through the area, stopping at Starbucks for her birthday freebie. She’s surprised at all the new stuff since she has been gone and says that it doesn’t feel as small-town anymore. Jingle jangles into the parking lot and then into Top Golf as the J’Locusts have all assembled in their area. A blonde toddler, likely a Gigglet, huddles by tables. Happy Birthday starts and Jingle hands the phone off to stand center stage. Everyone rushes to give Jingle a hug in their puffer jackets before an unholy apparition appears by the food table. Sperm has a fresh black puffer jacket zipped up like someone stuffed a bloated carcass into a Hefty bag for Satan’s own pig in a blanket. As he realizes Jingle is approaching with a camera Sperm looks up like a deer in headlights and then lets his herd of J’Locusts swarm the table as he flips on his smarmy huckster persona. They rave over a double sided app plate with Italian meats and pepperoncinis on one side and pretzels, cheese curds, olives and grapes on the other. Jingle exits the food line and runs over to the putting square. Lost Boys and J’-In-Loves battle it out for supremacy as Jingle asks for volunteers to show how “it’s done.” As various J’Locusts take their turn, eventually Perm shows up on the putting square before Jingle takes her birthday turn. After a couple of whacks at the ball, she turns back to where J’Annoying Orange has brought over mini metal buckets of little fried dough balls. He injects one with a red syringe as Jingle asks if it’s cherry or strawberry (it’s strawberry) as J’Annoying Orange signals it’s okay, decent. Joe of JoKen fame reveals he won as he is unrecognizable in a beard and Carhartt. Jingle points out the rest of the J’Locusts as she blathers on about how perfect and what a blast this is. She’s also never done Top Golf before. Instead of a Chocolate Mess, Jingle gets a basic ice cream sundae with Happy Birthday written in strawberry jelly. We now have the third rendition of Happy Birthday being sung. There’s nothing wrong with it per se, just as an introvert and former server, it makes me cringe after hearing it more than once. I know I’m in the minority though. More shots of Jingle swinging away as Dwreck and Jilly Nose Ring, Count and Countess Gagula appear and watch Jingle’s golf prowess develop before their eyes. Dwreck noticeably chews gum and I wonder if it’s to keep from biting his tongue.

Rimmy J’s snakelike mouth appears as he shows off the picture of Meech with the Duggalettes, in profile because “don’t ya know there’s just so darn many of em Heh heh”. Jingle reaches to zoom it in and says it needs to be on the wall. Jingle sticks her zoom in Dwreck’s face as he and his countess awkwardly stand nearish to Sperm.  Jingle then turns around to watch some zooming in video’s on a J’Lost Girls’ phone as Sperm continues to hold his phone up landscape like there is a line of people paying to get a gander at his girls. When no one is drawn to the image on his phone he calls everyone’s attention and it feels like TLC is going to yell cut run an ad for Little People Big World once Sperm has said he has an announcement for maximum attention through the commercials. No one pays a bit of attention to him as they gather and Jilly Nose Ring approaches her sisters.

Jingle is back in the driver’s seat and ready to jangle her way to some family bonding. Perm is riding shotgun, with J18 and J19 riding in the back. Most importantly though, riding in Jingle’s right hand is a 7 Brew coffee. The whole Duggalette crew told her she needed to try 7Brew, and so she got a sugar cookie latte for her birthday freebie. Y’all, she’s filming this at the window of the drive thru. Ugh, be more obnoxious Jingle. I dare you. They get out of the car because the December Birthday Clurb is going to Marshall’s and Home Goods and wherever else J18 and J19 pick. They all got the same drink but in different sizes. How…special? I’m not sure what I’m supposed to take from this, tbh. Jingle shows us OfNostrils and CinderJana, Princess Preaching flipping through thrift store racks as Jingle points out that the line is all the way through the store. Well, I mean, all of y’all in a line is going to be like 5 times a normal retail line alone so, maybe don’t throw stones from your glass living room???  The Juggalettes whip out and compare shirts of different colors as Jingle says “we’re shopping at the Goodwill” because she felt like she needed a Goodwill “fix”. Mm-kay. J18 finds a shirt that has a 3-d glasses effect and by that I mean an attached cutout of the glasses, drink and hands in the photo to make them literally 3-d. J19 wrinkles up her nose at buying a shirt that looks like someone sold a greeting card-graphic tee idea to Shark Tank and this was the prototype. Jingle thinks this is the best thing about thrift stores. She decides on a True Grit sherpa quarter-zip for $6. She then waxes lyrical about the memories of thrifting with Griftma Mary and etc. It's different to thrift in Arkansas she says and I bet it is. She wanted that old style thrift for her birthday though. She looks over J19’s selections and approves them after finding a jean dress for herself.

Back at the House – Day 3. The El Ay Bookses take Publicitee and Privacee to see their aunts’ farm. J17 lets a sheep out of the pen while J19 leads a mini horse. I wonder if this is going on their invoices or if they can sell the animals to not have a dowry debt like Jilly Nose Ring. Publicitee tells her mother that she is allergic to the cat that walked by and that her eyes will water if she touches it. Jingle agrees and then brings her attention to the mini horse as J16 walks over to see the horse. J17 and J19 finally coax Publicitee onto the mini horse. The mini horse drops Publicitee off to ride in the ATV with Jere-Maw and driven by J16 before getting introduced to Privacee.

In the kitchen, J16 and J17 make guacamole while Prince and Princess Preaching make salsa. J’Lost In The Airport scrubs a pan with one hand while video calling with the other. Jingle and Jere-Maw meet across the counter of chips as she swings the camera along to show all the pans of food and a tiny baggie of cilantro, for the adventurous. Quick shots of people eating a chip or making a plate followed by a quick shot of the TLC bicycle photo hanging on the wall of the serving tables. Jere-Maw waits outside with a football and pets the sheep that have wandered over. Jere-Maw bets her he can throw the football through the basketball hoop. She agrees and bets $6 he won’t. She’s right.

Last day in Arkansas – Day 4. Jingle fills in the blanks of the day before saying that it was church then “The Big House”. Publicitee and Privacee were also thrilled to see all the animals. A bunch of the J’Locusts followed the El Ay Bookses back to the McBeardsley Manse, burning the midnight oil until 2 am. At least for Jere-Maw’s part, she conked out at midnight cause she’s pregnant. The McBeardsleys and the Preachings got up early and did a hard core workout. Jere-Maw and Jingle declined and took Privacee to get her brand-new glasses adjusted. The J’Locust herd descends on another restaurant and includes Bearded Santa guy at the group’s table.  After group shots that show various groupings, Jingle commandeers J18 to drop them off at the airport. Jingle hurriedly wraps up as she explains that it’s December 23^(rd) in the vlog and Jere-Maw’s parents got to El Ay last night so they need to hurry back to do Christmas on the West Coast with them. “SO sweet and back to LA we go” are her parting words to us and so we leave it there.

Thank you for your patience regarding the delay of the Fifth Day of Snarkmas, and HAPPY NEW YEARS!

Monetization is fine. Credit for script is required. Please let me know if you use my script.

**Word count:** 1,417

**Summary:** Listener collides with cute neighbor (narrator) while leaving a coffee shop, spilling listener’s coffee. Cute neighbor insists on buying listener a new one and when the barista gives them their drinks in mugs instead of to-go cups, they end up on an accidental date. 

*(italics)* - Unvoiced notes & stage direction/sounds 
**(…)** - silence for listener response 

**Script below**

*(Suggested: coffee shop background noises.)*

*(Swinging cafe door.)*

*(Surprise)* “Whoa! Didn’t see you there.”

*(Gasp.)* “Shoot… I just totally knocked your coffee out of your hands. I’m sorry. You didn’t get any spilled on you did you?” 

**(…)**

“Me? Oh, don’t worry about me, few drops on my jeans, I had it coming… Most of it just splashed on the floor. Let me just grab something to get that…”

*(Moves to grab napkins.)*

“There… Oh, no it’s okay really. I got it. But hey, uh… let me buy you a new one.” 

**(…)**

“No, really, it’s the least I could do. I wasn’t paying attention and walked straight into you. *Please.*” 

**(…)**

*(Whispered aside)* “So uhh… I don’t know if you remember me, but we’ve met a few times in passing. I’m 26 B? Yeah. I get mail meant for you sometimes.” 

**(…)**

“Yeah, I always get a little jealous when I see your food delivery orders…”

**(…)**

“What? You’ve got good taste. I didn’t realize you come to this coffee shop too though. So, what’ll it be? Come on, I’m going to order a drink for myself anyway.”

**(…)**

“Okay good. Very classic. Hang on just a sec. I’ll put the order in…”

*(Mumbled coffee orders over the din of the coffee shop.)*

*(Back to listener.)* “I am really sorry for bowling into you earlier. I’m usually not so in my head. I think the whole holiday has me out of sorts…”

**(…)**

”Yeah, I know it’s just pink hearts and red confetti, but uhh… I don’t know. It sucks to be alone on Valentine’s Day. And it’s not like it’s the first time I’ve been single this time of year, or anything like that. It’s more that it’s just… I’m rambling and you totally did not sign up for this. You don’t even know me that well. I’m sorry. I don’t want to dump all this on you.” 

**(…)**

”You’re single too?” (*Little laugh*.) “I wouldn’t have assumed…”

**(…)**

”What? No - it’s nothing like that. It’s just that you’re cute. I’m not trying to make a big thing about it. Just that someone like you probably gets asked on dates all the time…”

**(…)**

”Well, at least I’m in good company then… So, maybe you get it then too, with all the flowers, the heart-shaped boxes, the happy couples in ads. That all this lovey-dovey stuff is everywhere, you know? It just makes me feel... Wrong? For being alone? It’s so stupid… I know there’s nothing wrong with being single. It doesn’t bother me so much the rest of the year. And it’s not even like there’s anyone from my past I’m pining over. But still…”

**(…)**

“Plans tonight? *Ha!* No… of course not. My bright idea was to stuff my face with Thai food from the new place around the corner and fall asleep on the couch to a steady stream of old sitcoms. Maybe Seinfeld? It’s kinda nice to drifting off to something with a laugh track. I really have been craving delivery from there since I saw you order the other day. But yeah… That’s my sad little Valentine’s Day plan. What about you?” 

**(…)**

“Okay fine, maybe I was a little harsh calling Thai food and sitcoms a *sad* way to celebrate. I’m a bit of an introvert and uh… it’s kind of a nice way to spend the night any other day of the year.” 

*(Hears order number called.)* “Hang on- that’s ours. I’ll grab our drinks…”

“So… umm… I *might* have forgotten to specify that we wanted these to-go… Sorry about that, I can go ask-“

**(…)**

“You’re sure?” I mean, I have time to drink it here but umm… I don’t want to keep you. You were headed out the door when I ran into you.”

**(…)**

“That would be nice actually. I’d appreciate the company…”

**(…)**

”Okay, I’d *meant* to order these to-go, so ideally you wouldn’t have noticed all the whipped cream and sprinkles on top of my drink… What? I might be grouchy about Valentine’s Day but this shop makes some really good specialty drinks. So, even if I’m single and alone today, damn it all if I’m going to get through it all without a strawberry mocha extra whip.” 

 **(…)**

”Come on, don’t laugh at me. You know I’m right. Watch, you’re going to end up ordering whatever mint-shamrock thing they whip up for St. Patrick’s day and kick yourself for not taking my word for it now.”

“I don’t have cooties or anything… You could try it if you’d like. Okay, you sure? I mean, more for me. Just let me know if you change your mind. I’ll probably end up ordering another for the walk home anyway.” 

*(Sipping drink)*

“I try the apps too. I know I’m supposed to be putting myself out there. And sometimes I do, but it’s hard. Sometimes it feels more like a job interview than a date. I keep thinking how am I supposed to even know if I like the person or if we *click* if I’m too busy worrying over whether or not I did everything right?”

*(Chuckles.)* “It’s a real catch twenty-two, isn’t it? I think part of me still holds out hope that the love of my life will just show up one day like out of a movie. Like maybe the barista will mix up our orders and give us a reason to keep talking. The kind of story we can laugh about later. And it’ll just be easy.” 

**(…)**

“Yeah, admittedly I *did* pull that one example from experience. Barista here mixed up my order twice with someone else and that was how I ended up meeting the *particularly* lovely Mr. Clarence Allen. He told me he’s been happily taken for the last thirty years and that he didn’t appreciate my sense of humor.” *(Laughs lightly.)*

“At least you don’t seem to mind my humor… I really do feel terrible for knocking your coffee right out of your hand like that. I’m the worst kind of oblivious sometimes… So, where are you heading after this?”

*(Flustered.)* “Sorry that was rude. You don’t have to answer that if you don’t want to. I didn’t mean to pry. I’m walking home after - was just going to order another one of these for the walk back and thought, would you want one too? If you’re going the same way…?” 

**(…)**

”Oh, you were going to run some errands.That makes sense. Yeah. I understand. But hey, you know where I live still, right? 26 B - I’m still ordering Thai food tonight and you know what my plans are. You’re welcome to come by if you’re still not doing anything. I mean, I’ll get it if plans change, but I know mine won’t.”

**(…)**

”No, I wasn’t trying to… “

**(…)**

”Unless you want it to be a date… No, it’s Valentine’s Day and I’m being ridiculous. I’m sure the last thing you want is -“

“Oh, umm… Okay. You want to come by? I mean, I really don’t want you to feel any pressure. You hardly know me and being the total klutz that I am, I just knocked your coffee out of your hand. You don’t owe me anything… If anything I owe you-“

**(…)**

”Be for real, right now. I might be bad at all this romance stuff and *flirting* but uh… no, I’m definitely into you. You’re like so cute. I wouldn’t *not* want it to be a date. If you were interested. And I mean, I’ve seen you around, I won’t pretend like I didn’t think about you a little. I mean, no one wants to be *that* neighbor, but yeah.”

**(…)**

”I really shouldn’t be telling you this kind of thing. I don’t want it to be weird. But yeah. I think you’re cute. Like *really* cute. And I’ve already admitted I notice it when you order delivery… It’s not a big thing, and I mean we live in the same neighborhood, so it shouldn’t be that big of a surprise, but we like all the same places. So, maybe it wouldn’t be such a big leap to think maybe if I asked you out to a restaurant sometime, you might also really like the spot I’d pick.” 

“It’s not like I’d look at your mail or through your window. *Shoot* - why did I even say that? I’m not a creep, I swear.” 

**(…)**

”Oh, wait… You’re serious? You’ll come by tonight?”

**(…)**

”Only if it’s a date?” *(Shyly)* “Well, okay…”

”And if all goes well, maybe then a real date? Yeah? Okay. I’ll order food at 7. Come by any time after that.”

**(…)**

”Yeah, I’ll see you then.”

the irony isn't lost on me that I'm starting a ""new diet for the new year"" but I am choosing to not have that outlook towards my goal. I am unhappy with where I'm at and want to make changes to improve my life overall.
I've been influenced by diet culture and all the other rhetoric since I was 8 and I refuse to get sucked into that blackhole again. I like to think that I'm fairly active; I walk a lot and constantly lift large items repetitively, but I know that it's not enough. nutrition wise I don't think I'm getting the most out of my meals, but I also don't eat as regularly as I'm supposed to? I know one of my biggest issues is portioning- as an example, I'll have an iced coffee for breakfast and then what feels like three or four meals in one sitting at like 10pm. or I'm constantly finishing one ""snack"" and going back for another (as in veggies and hummus, then chips and salsa, then an egg or something similar) I've never had luck with counting calories or tracking points, etc- those methods just seem to impact my mental health in such negative ways it becomes unhealthy for my body overall. meal prepping was working for a while but it's unreasonably time consuming and I get burnt out and bored within two or three weeks

My boyfriend and I met in college, he’s an international student. By the way, when I say international I am not talking like halfway across the world, his country is right next door. We have been together for two years, and have recently moved in together around 4 months ago. In the past two years he has been completely integrated into my life. I have introduced him to all of my family, friends, acquaintances, he’s literally met my uncle’s daughter’s dog okay. To me this is normal because if I am going to live with someone then our relationship is serious and he deserves to be fully integrated into my life. Normal, right?

So here’s the thing, despite the fact that we LIVE TOGETHER his parents don’t know we are dating and because of this I have never gone back home with him to see his life there. He goes home multiple times a year, often for weeks or months at a time. He has spent 6 months, 1/4, of our relationship in his hometown. His brother and friends back home all know about me, and his parents know we live together but just think we are friends/roommates. Aside from speaking to his brother occasionally over facetime, I have never met or have even seen what any of his friends look like. A lot of his friends are women which makes this even more strange because women usually like to follow their friends partners on social media and will ask their friends to be introduced to their new partner. That has at least been my experience with all of my girl friends. None of them follow me. But whenever he goes back home he hangouts with them, sometimes ALONE, and it makes me super uncomfortable because i literally do not know these people. The only person from his hometown who has ever even tried to follow or connect with me was HIS EX. 

We have had quite a few instances both in my country and when he is back home with breaching of boundaries so my trust in him has already been tested. So whenever he goes home I just feel even more paranoid than usual. I am prone to being anxious and originally my friends were telling me I was being a tad controlling so for the past two years I have assumed this was a me issue. But I recently explained to my friends that I have never been introduced to any of his friends that live back in his hometown and they all immediately changed their tune. Not sure why I never gave them that context, perhaps I just assumed this was normal because he was acting like it was. Now my friends are all telling me that I am god’s strongest soldier and have no clue how I haven’t lost my mind yet (I have been close to be honest). 

I have brought this up with him and he thinks this is totally normal. He thinks it makes sense that I have not met or been introduced to his friends from back home because I’ve never been there so obviously they wouldn’t know me or follow me or even know what I look like. To me though, that does not make sense?? I’ve been in long distance relationships before and it was not like this?? and have quite a few long distance friends myself but he has spoken to all of them many times. It just makes me feel like he’s hiding some sort of secret wife, which i know is irrational but honestly how could I possibly know?

To be fair to him, he has one friend from his hometown that I’ve met many times because he also moved here to study. But my boyfriend is also friends with his girlfriend and she comes to visit a lot yet we have never met?? again, could not even tell you what she looks like but he just spent new years at her house party. His brother and 3 of his friends have visited him in my hometown since we have started dating and every time i would not be included in his plans. he claims he just wants me to “meet them properly”. and “doesn’t want our first time meeting to be like that”. whatever that means.

Some additional information for context: Him and his friends from back home do not talk that often when he isn’t in town, they maybe call a couple times or text briefly. It took him FOUR MONTHS to tell his brother we were dating and even he thinks that was dumb because his brother is his best friend and was happy for him. When his brother visited his dad was also with him. His parents don’t know we are dating because of “cultural reasons” (they are very westernized so this is starting to make less sense to me). Despite never introducing me to his friends, he still thinks I should be 100% comfortable when he hangouts with his girl friends 1 on 1 for coffee or dinner or bowling or whatever else. When his best friend’s girlfriend comes to visit he also has never met up with them, and has only seen her with him when they are back home. He has introduced me to all of his friends that he made at university (one girl). He posts me on his social media frequently so all his friends definitely know we are together but no one (neither him nor his friends) have made an effort to connect with me. 

I am making this with the intention to show it to him because I personally feel like that is the only way for him to understand that this is in fact abnormal. If I’m being unreasonable and this makes total sense to you do let me know. But if you also think it would be incredibly disorienting to not have been introduced to most of the people in your partners life WHEN YOU LITERALLY LIVE TOGETHER yet still being expected to trust them when they go home for weeks/months during the year then feel free to share your perspective!

TLDR: My boyfriend (20M) and I (22F) live together and have been dating for two years. He is an international student who goes back home for several weeks or months out of the year. I have not been introduced to any of his friends or his parents, literally don’t even know what they look like. I have not gone back home with him either. He thinks this is normal, I think it is insane. Thoughts?",3,1735760328.0,relationships,12,1.0,False

This is a really stressful time period for me, and I am a stress eater. Not necessarily a binger, I just like to snack on stuff while I’m studying and most importantly, have a drink next to me at all times. Whether that be coffee, matcha, or iced tea.

I’ve set my mind to losing weight before, and I actually did it, losing about 11kg (24lbs) and reaching 53kg (116lbs). However over the course of the last 2 years I truly gained the weight back, with me now being at my all time highest weight of 73kg (160lbs). Some of the reasons include the overwhelming amount of studying I now have to do, causing me to be unable of working out (I used to love going on walks/runs and dancing, which helped me to lose the weight). Now I simply do not have the time to workout or even go on walks, and I crave junk food and snacks due to how much stress im under. I’ve gained face fat, and while it isnt as evident in the rest of my body, I feel uncomfortable and bloated most of the time. 

I don’t know how to fix this issue because frankly, I used to have way more free time and energy that id use to focus on my fitness journey, but now I barely have time to sleep.

1hrahxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hrahxb/aita_for_lying_to_a_stranger/,AITA for lying to a stranger,For context I have recently started volunteering to transport wildlife. Over the holidays recently I had to transport an injured animal. As I had been driving for over an hour I was hoping to stop somewhere for a bite to eat and a drink or coffee before heading home. The location was regional and very lovely. Also known for wineries. I bumped into the chef of the estate ( which was closed ) and asked if anything was open and he offered to whip me something up since I had done something kind. He seemed nice enough so I agreed. At first the conversation was quite normal although I was feeling like he was being too nice but then he told me about a couple who had a hit an animal nearby and totalled their car so they helped them out with somewhere to stay and food etc whilst the couple organised a hire car. Once I started eating he asked me if I drank and then he asked if I smoked weed. Both of these questions set off alarm bells and I was thinking wtf/ very uncomfortable at that point. The very next question was if I had a partner which made me really uncomfortable so yes I lied. He said he didn’t believe me (for a racial reason). That reasoning irritated me but I didn’t say anything I let him have his assumption. He also said sone thing complaining about women in general which I ignored as I did not want to argue. He then said I could hang out the rest of the afternoon. I thanked him for one of many times and left probably 5 minutes after I finished eating. He probably was insulted I felt uncomfortable and felt I had to lie. I am not very experienced with the opposite gender. Was I being paranoid/overreacting?

It’s pink. She doesn’t own any pink because she’s a bad biker bitch, so she puts on three different pink eyeshadows simultaneously and calls it her pink smoky eye. She puts on a Ring Blizzard band tee that is ten times too big for her, as well as black booty shorts and fishnets with her new sparkly docs. She makes her coffee of the day, Door County’s new special flavor called “Witch’s Brew”. She makes a cup for herself and drinks it out of the side of her mouth through a gigantic metal straw. It’s the most amazing coffee ever invented. She then makes a mug for Thaddeus. “It’s pretty good,” he says without even looking at her. He’s scrolling through the social media he doesn’t even have. She looks directly into the camera and says he’s just busy thinking about quantum physics. We then transition to her sitting on the floor in front of her couch. Candida talks about how she’s upset she didn’t get engaged to on Christmas and that’s why she went on a bender the day after and laid down and never moved again. She got a whiff of Todd’s chocolate treat and freaked out, ending up balls deep in the candy aisle at Walmart. She topped all the candy off with twelve beef patties and cheese slices from McDonald’s, with a Diet Coke to wash it all down. Courtney pretends to like her dogs while petting them and promising to eat only air and butter from now on. She is also cured of her BPD so it doesn’t matter if she never gets to marry Tony.

This is the fifth and final part in my mafia ex-girlfriend series.

When I first wrote part 1, I wasn't feeling very well. I never intended to write a sequel, let alone make a series. And now that I have finished writing part 5, I once again find myself not feeling all that well.

Several months have elapsed between part 1 and 5, and much has happened during that time. I've taken breaks from this series, forgotten about it for a while, returned to it, written on-and-off, left again.  Over time, the prose in the scripts has come to mirror my mood, and- if it makes sense- the characters have seemed to take on a life of their own. I wasn't authoring their fate- only chronicling it.

I never really had a clear direction in mind of where I wanted to take this story. Whether I intended it to be toxic or sincerely romantic, a cautionary tale of obsession or one of redemption. Which is why, I feel as though the characters simply decided to take me along with them on their journey. And even without realizing it, that journey somehow- in some way- became linked with mine.

I have made mistakes like everyone else. There are things I regret. Ironically, although I'm supposed to be a writer, the right words have often failed me when I needed them most. And I've often not been given a chance to do things over and make up for my mistakes.

Which- I guess- is why I really, really wanted the two of them to have a second chance.

To everyone who has been following this series- thank you, sincerely. I've read every comment, and I'm grateful for your compliments, critiques and interest.

**SCRIPT:**



*(SFX: Rainfall)*

Rabbit?

Are you in there?

*(SFX: Footsteps)*

Raaabiiiiit! I’m home! Where’s my little bunny hiding? Where could he have gone off to again?

(Quietly) Huh. So you prepared dinner. Silly boy. I told you I was going to be late.

But where is he...? Did he- did he fall asleep waiting for me?

*(SFX: Footsteps)*

(To herself) It’s okay. Calm yourself, Talia. He’s...he’s going to be there. This time, he won’t...

*(SFX: Door opening)*

Rabbit?

(Very quietly) Where...where are you?

Wait. Did you just- (sighing) you silly thing. Burying yourself under the blankets.

How many times have I told you to keep your head above the blankets? You need to maintain air circulation.

(Sighing again) Are you even listening to me?

(Snapping her fingers) Pet? Can you hear me? Are you awake?

Um, pet...?

(Soft) Very well. I’ll just invade your bed then.

*(SFX: Rustling of bedsheets)*

(Gently) Hey.

Yes. Yes, it’s me. Your Talli.

(Muttering under her breath) Still haven’t come around to that nickname...

Sshh. Don’t worry about me. I’m fine. I just want to hold you for a bit.

Yeah.

Oh, I got back a while ago. I was in the bathtub, actually. Thanks for drawing me a bath. Just the way I like it, too.

Yeah. I had to reheat the water because I arrived late, but- it’s fine, really. You are not to be blamed.

Although...I’d have very much preferred it if you were there to help me bathe. Your hands are so much nicer and softer than the loofah. And it’s quite the sight, just leaning back into the tub and letting the warm, soapy, scented water wash over my body, while you dutifully kneel beside the tub. Kissing my hand, and listening to me tell you all about my day.

(Sighing wistfully) I missed you. Don’t let it happen again, pet. (Soft) Or I’ll have to punish you...for neglecting your wife’s needs...

Mhm. Good boy. (Kissing him)

What is it, pet?

No. I’m not hungry. I already ate dinner outside. I told you I’d be late before leaving.

Why are you apologizing for making me dinner, bunny? I can just reheat everything for breakfast.

Yes. That does sound like something *you* would do. Oh, pet...I really do love you, but I fear you may be a very evil influence on me.

(Giggling) Hey. Don’t move around so much. Let me hold you.

It’s okay. I know rabbit likes his personal space, but Mistress doesn’t care. Mistress wants to cuddle.

So what if I’m the big spoon? This is how you like it, anyway.

Oh? For once, you wanted to cuddle me instead?

(Sighing) Oh, my poor, innocent pet...(whispering) that is a privilege not easily given. You have to earn it.

You can start by letting me snuggle you closer. (Low, sultry) And by not shivering so much when you feel my breath against the back of your neck...feel my lips nibbling at the sides...mhmn, sooo *needy* (kiss)...poor pet...unable to get away, forced to just lie there and take it...to feel my teeth grazing down the sides of your poor, vulnerable neck...softly, slowly...continuously. (Kiss)

(Teasing) I do enjoy it when you shiver from my attentions...but surely my rabbit still has just a tiny bit of a spark left in him? Surely he doesn’t want to give me the satisfaction of winning so easily every single time?

(Whispering) Isn’t that right...little boy? (Kissing him)

Come, now. Be good for me. Let me cuddle my favourite body pillow.

Body pillow says what? (Giggling a bit)

How sweet. Thanks for reminding me again.

(Faintly) I love you too...my darling.

*(Slow, audible breathing and rain. No words.)*

Of course I’m still wearing the ring you gave me. And why wouldn’t I? It’s the second prettiest thing I have ever seen. The first is you, of course.

Yes. I do mean it. We made a deal, remember? No lies, no secrets between us.

I’m quite fond of this ring. You *really* didn’t have to blow your savings to get me this- what a silly boy. Money’s not something you should ever worry about. You’re mine.

But I do admit, I...I am quite fond of it. It reminds me of you, which is why I often look at it during the day, wherever I may be.

It reminds me that things will be okay, no matter how terrible and hopeless they may seem in the present.

When you left me, I just saw ghosts everywhere. On the roofs of buildings, on the sidewalks, sitting inside coffee shops. The colour from the world was bleached out. And...it was like the memories we shared had almost taken on a visible shape. Intangible to the touch, and yet, present wherever I went. Haunting me. Like ghosts.

I’m sorry too. But it’s in the past. You...you are here now. You are home.

I like to think that, perhaps- eventually- you’d have returned to me on your own. I wouldn’t have had to leash you, and bring you back in chains the way I did, months ago.

I like to think you’d have come back to me.

I know, pet. I know. You always tell me how running away was the hardest thing you’ve ever done. And that you thought of me too, while you were living on your own. Wondering how I was, what I was doing.

Did you stare at the window too, when it was dark and quiet and all you could hear was the rain...? Did you watch the raindrops sliding down the glass by yourself?

Did you see ghosts too, reflected on the windowpane?

I see.

It has been raining ever since you proposed to me. I can’t say it’s pleasant outside in this weather, but at night, when I’m with you and just listening to the soft drumming of rain on housetops and windows- it’s almost bearable.

What? Were you expecting me to share your view of how romantic this is? I said it’s almost bearable. I’m being generous!

Besides, the streetlights sometimes reflect on the glass- and get all blurry because of the water. I don’t like it. It’s like seeing vague, wandering souls painted in water colour.

Silver is the colour of souls. Everyone knows that.

Because it’s mysterious. Now stop asking questions, and let me cuddle you.

(Groaning softly) What is it now?

The colour of memories? I don’t know. Probably the colour of your eyes.

Because when I look into your eyes, I always think of some random moment we spent together. It’s quite annoying. (Sighing, soft) Occasionally makes me smile.

(Repeating) What’s the colour of dreams? (Sighing)

Black.

Because you have to close your eyes to dream. Something I’d very much like for you to do right now.

Just close your eyes, and dream of me. While I hold you and nuzzle into your neck. It’s the least you can do for me, after I was so generous to start allowing you to sleep without your collar on.

(Faintly) Sometimes I worry I’m being too soft on you...but, apparently, relationships are all about compromising, so...

Yes, rabbit, well done. They’re also about communicating. Which is something we don’t have to do right now. Now, how about you just-

(Despairing) Oh, pet. Don’t do that. Please. You know how I get when you call me Talli.

I get...I get irritated! And then I start protesting, and I can’t seem to stop talking with you, and one thing leads to another and-

(Rueful) What? What is it?

Excuse me?

You want to know what’s the colour of love? Is there a point to this game, rabbit?

I’ve had a long day at work. The only reason I haven’t gagged you by now is because you feel nice in my arms. And you used my favourite shampoo.

(Sighing) Fine. I’ll tell you.

Love is...whatever colour this room is, right now.

I don’t know what it’s called. There’s the silver lighting from outside, refracted through the raindrops and the glass. There’s the black ink of night, covering everything in shadows. And...there’s the colour of your eyes, as you blink and trace those shadows on our walls and ceiling.

(Pensive) I never thought I would come home to...to domestic bliss. To what we have. Someone like me, who can only see the souls of other people, but lost her own long ago.

Oh, but I did. I’m the queen of the largest crime syndicate in this city. I bought off my rivals, and those that couldn’t be bought- I disposed of them.

I have suffered pain and scars, and after a point, I grew numb to them. It was the only way to move forward. The time to process things is a luxury so many take for granted.

I haven’t had that for the longest time. Everything I’ve inherited from my father, and everything I’ve built for myself- all the things I’ve come to possess- they were only painkillers. Things that let me forget my wounds...things that never healed those wounds.

(Ghost of a smile) And that’s why I love you so much, my rabbit.

You taught me what it’s like to care for someone else. To share your life with them. You showed me what’s it like to love, and be loved back.

And you’re still here, showing me these things. Showing me dreams of the future, and memories both of us had locked away. Because of you, I’m able to see what my soul once looked like, and...and I really do wonder if someday I’ll find it again.

Will you help me look?

(Smiling ever so gently) My rabbit...

I don’t deserve you, but since you chose to hop towards the most dangerous monster in the woods, I...I’m not letting you go either.

Never again. You’ll forever be my prisoner. And I’m a cruel queen. A very *possessive* queen. And it’s just your rotten luck that you caught my eye. (Kissing him) Stole my heart...you little thief...there’s nothing you can do or say now, that’ll make me think for even a fraction of a second about releasing you.

You’re mine. You always will be, little rabbit. (Whispering) I will never let go of your leash...I will never let you escape my touch.

What a curious thing to say. Of course you’re not going anywhere, pet. (Sweetly) You love me, don’t you?

I believe you, rabbit. And I’ll never tire of hearing you say it.

You’re not like those ghosts. I can’t see them anymore.

The ghosts are gone. And all that remains...is a second chance, to do things right this time.

Thank you as well, my rabbit, for giving me that chance.

The mafia princess and her rabbit. What do you think?

It’s not a bad name for a story, right?

Oh, well. At least we’re the authors. Let’s make sure to write a happy ending, yes?

(Giggling) That’s what I thought.

Now, you do realize you have to accompany me for shopping tomorrow, yes? I’m not going to listen to any excuses you make about not getting enough sleep.

What’s the fun in having my men always bring me what I want? No, I’d much rather drag you along with me to the shopping mall. There are so many dresses I want to try out, and you’re going to help me choose. Even if it takes all day.

You decided to propose to me, darling. You better be prepared for all the additional responsibilities.

(Pitying) Oh, poor thing. You have no idea what you signed up for, do you?

Don’t worry. You’ll find out very, very soon. And you *will* enjoy tending to my every need. (Soft) I’ll make certain of that.

Do get some sleep now (kissing him). You’re going to need it.

That’s my darling.

You’re not going anywhere.

(Whispering) Sweet dreams...rabbit.

Before getting out of the car he pondered whether he would need his laptop or should just go in with a novel. He had about an hour to kill and didn’t know whether he wanted to get some work done or just spend some time catching up on his reading, which he knew was lacking a lot. At the end he decided on neither and just got out of the car will his airpods in his ears and played his favourite Christmas tunes. 

The street was surprisingly empty with very little noise from the oncoming vehicles. The snow on the pavement was thick as he strode to the nearby café, the one he always ends up at least twice a week. He loved this place because it had large glass for a wall that looked straight into the town centre. He could spend hours in there looking and pondering at random people walking, talking and just living their lives. 

As he walked into the café, he was greeted by a friendly face who took his order. 

‘A flat white, please,” he said.

“Anything else,” the café person asked with a smile in her face. 

“No, thank you,” he replied. 

“That will be 3.40 please,” 

“of course,” he said as he tapped on the contactless card reader. 

“Merry Christmas,” she uttered, and he hurriedly wished her back. 

The café was busy. People walking in constantly, some leaving. The place seemed packed but thankfully he was able to spot an empty chair on the far end of the room right next to the glass wall. He moved quickly to it before he could lose the place to someone else. Happily, he sat there, removed the Airpods from his ears since the café was filled with mild Christmas tunes which was constantly drowned by the noise of people walking and talking. But he didn’t mind that. The café was warm, maybe a bit too warm, but he was comfortable and content. 

His coffee arrived. He took the first sip, satisfied with its temperature and taste he sat back and relaxed. It has been a long week and this one hour was precious. Finally, he can sit back and relax a bit. Turn his mind off things and tomorrow can sort itself later, right now he can just sit and enjoy this cup of coffee. As he sat there and looked around, he was able to see so many smiling faces, hurdled, gossiping, laughing, wishing each other. It put a smile on his face to see so many happy faces. And he turned around and looked outwards. The town centre was almost empty with very few people venturing about on this snowy day. It was a white Christmas after all. 

Once he finished his coffee, he wished he could have brought his book to read. Frustrated with himself he put his Airpods back in his ears and played his favourite playlist. His mind wandered as he wished he was not spending his Christmas alone but thoughts like that could soon spiral out of control and he was not willing to do that, hence he buried that feeling and looked around. 
Someone walked into the café. Something about that person made his heart to jump. Black dress, red scarf which covered almost half her face, short blonde hair. ‘It can’t be,’ he thought, ‘it surely can’t be her.’ His heart refused to stop racing. Unknowingly he sat up trying to get a good look at this person. She stood in a line to order with her back turned towards him. His hands were trembling from excitement, shock and memories. He almost jumped out of the chair trying desperately to see if it was Her. 
It felt like eternity. He patiently waited for her to turn around. Finally, she turned around with a coffee in her hand and there she was. It was her, and now his heart almost jumped out of his chest. Emotions flooded almost choking him. He hasn’t seen her forever but has never spend a day without thinking about her. 

She looked around to see if she could find a place to sit. Without realising what he was doing he got up from his chair and stood. Their eyes met. Her face registered shock for a split second and quickly got replaced with a smile. The smile which he was longing to see so many years. A smile that took his breath away, still. She walked towards him, and he suddenly realised his legs were shaking, excitement? Fear? Or maybe bit of both. 

“How are you?” she asked approaching him. 

“I’m fine how are you?” he asked back blushing with a grin. 

“I’m fine too,” she said as she hesitated to hug him. He extended his arms, and she hugged him. Her head against his chest and his arms around her, tight. He felt like the time stopped; his heart calmed. Tremendous amount of joy filled his heart almost choked him. Memories came rushing in. He was not able to contain himself. He wished this lasted forever, but he had to let her go. Both looked back at each other with the same smile but this time both of their eyes were glistening with tears. 

He helped her to remove her coat and pulled the chair back for her to sit. And he quickly sat across her and looked at her. Both might have aged since they last saw each other but his heart still thumped like for the first time he laid his eyes on her. He was so overwhelmed that words betrayed him as he sat there silently just taking in everything; her beautiful face, that breath taking smile, those gorgeous eyes – which made him to fall in love all over again. And those wrinkles around her eyes when she smiled, which has not changed. It only made him realise that he never stopped loving her even after all these years, he was still in love with her. 

Finally, she spoke and in a blink of an eye an hour turned into two as they both shared their life’s journey since they have parted. Minutes were flying and he wished he could stop the time. She checked the clock in her phone and her face changed and he knew it was time for her to leave. He couldn’t bear the thought of saying goodbye again to her. ‘What if I never see her again,’ he thought petrified. Fate, for whatever reason, made them meet that Christmas eve and he was not going to let that be a co-incidence. 
“Are you free for an hour tomorrow?” he asked hesitantly. 

“I have dinner plan with my family,” she uttered knowing that she was breaking his heart and her own. She saw his face turn pale as his smile faded. “Maybe I can spare a quick visit before I head for the dinner?” 

His smile returned. He had lot to do tomorrow, many laid out plans but all of that can wait. He didn’t care, none of that mattered at this moment. “Can we meet here tomorrow anytime that is suitable for you?” he said with a same excitement as a child. 

“Maybe noon,” she said. “I’m sorry but I have to leave now. Time slipped by. It was so good to see you again.” 

“It was,” he replied.

They both got up. He helped her with her coat and walked with her to the door. 

“Hopefully we meet tomorrow,” she said with a smile. He could see a bit of sadness in her smile. And she hugged him. He held her tight once more. Screaming inside his mind ‘Please don’t go baby.’ But no words came out. He slowly released her from his grip and saw her turn around and walk away from him. He was smiling but tears started to roll out with no control. The love of his life walking away from him, again. 

That night was painful. A sleepless night. He just lay there with a vacant eye lost deep into the past. The days where they were together, the laughter, jokes, the long drives, castles conquered together, countryside walk, music that were shared and a future that was planned that never came to be. As the sun rose, he got up from the bed and ran to the shower. He had 5 hours to meet her again, but he was restless. No amount of logic or reasoning was going to dampen his excitement to see her again, even if this meeting could very well be the last goodbye that was never uttered years ago. A closure that he never wanted. 

It was 11 am. Sun was out blinding everyone with the reflection off the snow. He almost ran to the café. He was one of the few in the café on that Christmas day. He was full of hope (for what?) and excitement. He ran to the same table and sat there waiting. The minutes which were flying last evening was crawling today, which made him feel that hour of waiting dreadful. But nothing was getting his spirit down. 

The clock finally struck 12. His heart which was already pounding started to beat out of his chest. ‘Any moment now,’ he thought to himself as he kept scanning every face that walked out there. He was barely able to sit still on that chair.
The clock turned 12:15, still no sign of her. He was getting impatient. 

12:30. He started to get nervous. ‘What if she couldn’t make it? Will this be the end.’ And cursed himself for not getting her number to contact her. 

12:40. All hope was lost and his heart started to sink. His face turned pale, and his body slumped to the chair. His eyes started to swell. The world around him started to fade away. He felt so alone. He hopelessly waited for another 10 minutes when the café door swung open letting in the cold Christmas wind. 

And there she was. ",1,1735759633.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1hrab26,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hrab26/newbie_advice_is_modern_espresso_sour/,Newbie advice- is modern espresso sour?,"I have seen comments that 3rd wave beans give more of a sour flavor in espresso, but is that the standard? New to espresso in general via a cheap machine I got around the holidays and the shots I have been pulling lean acidic and I initially thought they tasted pretty sour. Went to the nicest coffee shop in my area and got a double shot as a reference point as to what good espresso should taste like and it legitimately tasted like they put lemon juice in the shot. Like made my mouth pucker sour. I don’t say that as an inherently negative thing, it was just so much more sour than I expected and more sour than what I was pulling at home. A friend of mine also got the same espresso machine and did the same experiment in his area- went to a local shop and got a double shot- and he said it tasted like there was lemon juice in it as well. 

So my question is, is that just a latent characteristic of espresso? I know people say that sourness tends to mean the shot was under extracted, but all of my shots leaning acidic and both me and my friend getting super sour shots from different shops in different areas is just making me wonder if that’s the profile of espresso these days or if the shots I am pulling and the shot I got from my shop were outliers to what the general “standard” for espresso would be. Also as someone that is unfamiliar with espresso and have limited exposure outside of lattes from Starbucks, I’m just trying to get a better idea of some of the default flavor characteristics of what good espresso should be. I know taste is subjective but I was just so shocked that everything I have made and at home along with a shot from a nice shop has so much sour/tart notes to it.

For the past two years I have had an anal fissure and uncomfortable bowel movements (feels like a pressing really hard on a bruise when I have a larger bowel movement). Sometimes the pain is sharp, but it varies.

Sometimes I will get a bit of blood with the bowel movement (not in the stool itself, but when I wipe there will be a little bit on the toilet paper.) I also sometimes pass some white mucus. Additionally, sometimes after I have a bowel movement I will get some crampy feelings in my stomach. 

Last month I had an episode lasting two days where it felt like my guts were trying to escape my stomach (everything around my uterus and back hurt) but then it went away after a day or two. 

My stools are more narrow than they have been, and today I went to the doctor to get checked out. She evaluated me and told me I had hemorrhoids and an anal fissure, but offered me a colonoscopy for peace of mind.

Seems we always been rocky because husband is always angry at the world and uses me as a punching bag. But lately has gotten worse and now it even seems he gets mad because he thinks to seem to know how I’m thinking or for simple stupid things like he got home from the gym and coffee wasn’t made. Or the other day he argued that I’m forgetting about our relationship because I don’t have time to do groceries and cook anymore. 

I do get that over the last six months I’ve been more distracted or busier I guess - in May of 2024, I had my first major lost of my life, I lost my grandmother to suicide and it’s taken a toll on the entire family. Not only that, but all of that happened in the middle of a big career and job change. New job is in Sales, so more demanding and requiring me to be out of the house more. So yes, I’ve have been busier and more distracted getting used to a new life and a new normal while coping with a trauma. I made this job change for both of us and we both knew what it was going to require before I took the step and ultimately to build a better future for us. But seems he is not supportive at all. Or he is frustrated that I’ve gotten so independent that he doesn’t feel needed and feels insecure. 

I don’t know how to feel. Because he makes it seem like it’s all my fault, the other day I went out with a friend and I asked him if it was okay, he agreed and when I got home he had the other room ready to sleep in and he said “the l only reason I agreed for you to go out was for you to feel stupid and see how you are forgetting about me” then went on to delete all pictures of me from his instagram. Seems everything is a test. Or sometimes takes things I like or even watch on tv and uses them against me in arguments like “you sound fake when you argue, like the movies you watch”. And then I try to get him to see my point that I feel disrespected, that I’m walking on eggshells because I don’t even feel comfortable watching TV near him, or that I’m being tested all the time and being called names and he says I’m not giving him enough arguments or that he doesn’t see my point or that I’m not making any sense. 

It all feels very back and forth, seems we never get anywhere. He gets in my head half of the time and then I feel guilty. Not sure how to feel anymore. And he twists everything to then being the “good” guy and never apologizes for anything. ",3,1735759387.0,abusiverelationships,2,1.0,False

I’m posting this to prove a point so please let me know in the comments if i’m insane or being unreasonable. My boyfriend and I met in college, he’s an international student. By the way, when I say international I am not talking like halfway across the world, his country is right next door. We have been together for two years, and have recently moved in together around 4 months ago. In the past two years he has been completely integrated into my life. I have introduced him to all of my family, friends, acquaintances, he’s literally met my uncle’s daughter’s dog okay. To me this is normal because if I am going to live with someone then our relationship is serious and he deserves to be fully integrated into my life. Normal, right?

So here’s the thing, despite the fact that we LIVE TOGETHER his parents don’t know we are dating and because of this I have never gone back home with him to see his life there. He goes home multiple times a year, often for weeks or months at a time. He has spent 6 months, 1/4, of our relationship in his hometown. His brother and friends back home all know about me, and his parents know we live together but just think we are friends/roommates. Aside from speaking to his brother occasionally over facetime, I have never met or have even seen what any of his friends look like. A lot of his friends are women which makes this even more strange because women usually like to follow their friends partners on social media and will ask their friends to be introduced to their new partner. That has at least been my experience with all of my girl friends. None of them follow me. But whenever he goes back home he hangouts with them, sometimes ALONE, and it makes me super uncomfortable because i literally do not know these people. The only person from his hometown who has ever even tried to follow or connect with me was HIS EX. 

We have had quite a few instances both in my country and when he is back home with breaching of boundaries so my trust in him has already been tested. So whenever he goes home I just feel even more paranoid than usual. I am prone to being anxious and originally my friends were telling me I was being a tad controlling so for the past two years I have assumed this was a me issue. But I recently explained to my friends that I have never been introduced to any of his friends that live back in his hometown and they all immediately changed their tune. Not sure why I never gave them that context, perhaps I just assumed this was normal because he was acting like it was. Now my friends are all telling me that I am god’s strongest soldier and have no clue how I haven’t lost my mind yet (I have been close to be honest). 

I have brought this up with him and he thinks this is totally normal. He thinks it makes sense that I have not met or been introduced to his friends from back home because I’ve never been there so obviously they wouldn’t know me or follow me or even know what I look like. To me though, that does not make sense?? I’ve been in long distance relationships before and it was not like this?? and have quite a few long distance friends myself but he has spoken to all of them many times. It just makes me feel like he’s hiding some sort of secret wife, which i know is irrational but honestly how could I possibly know?

To be fair to him, he has one friend from his hometown that I’ve met many times because he also moved here to study. But my boyfriend is also friends with his girlfriend and she comes to visit a lot yet we have never met?? again, could not even tell you what she looks like but he just spent new years at her house party. His brother and 3 of his friends have visited him in my hometown since we have started dating and every time i would not be included in his plans. he claims he just wants me to “meet them properly”. and “doesn’t want our first time meeting to be like that”. whatever that means.

Some additional information for context: Him and his friends from back home do not talk that often when he isn’t in town, they maybe call a couple times or text briefly. It took him FOUR MONTHS to tell his brother we were dating and even he thinks that was dumb because his brother is his best friend and was happy for him. When his brother visited his dad was also with him. His parents don’t know we are dating because of “cultural reasons” (they are very westernized so this is starting to make less sense to me). Despite never introducing me to his friends, he still thinks I should be 100% comfortable when he hangouts with his girl friends 1 on 1 for coffee or dinner or bowling or whatever else. When his best friend’s girlfriend comes to visit he also has never met up with them, and has only seen her with him when they are back home. He has introduced me to all of his friends that he made at university (one girl). He posts me on his social media frequently so all his friends definitely know we are together but no one (neither him nor his friends) have made an effort to connect with me. 

I am making this with the intention to show it to him because I personally feel like that is the only way for him to understand that this is in fact abnormal. If I’m being unreasonable and this makes total sense to you do let me know. But if you also think it would be incredibly disorienting to not have been introduced to most of the people in your partners life WHEN YOU LITERALLY LIVE TOGETHER yet still being expected to trust them when they go home for weeks/months during the year then feel free to share your perspective!

TLDR: My boyfriend (20M) and I (22F) live together and have been dating for two years. He is an international student who goes back home for several weeks or months out of the year. I have not been introduced to any of his friends or his parents, literally don’t even know what they look like. I have not gone back home with him either. He thinks this is normal, I think it is insane. Thoughts?",0,1735759241.0,relationship_advice,6,0.5,False

Here’s a quick about me + a few of my hobbies or things I enjoy (or stuff I want to learn). So just let me know if any of these things have a social club nearby (I’ll be near where Lulah Hills is going in) OR if you’re nearby and would wanna be friends!! 

Just turned 34 in December and am a single cat lady unashamedly 😂. Adventurous soul (I’m the friend you call on the weekend if you wanna take a random quick trip somewhere lol). I have 2 cats and a dog (she’s a husky/pyr/boxer mix and she loves everyone and every dog she’s ever met). I like to hike and camp though due to some surgeries this last year I’ve kinda lost alllll my conditioning. But I’m working out at the gym to gain it back and can do shorter hikes for now on warmer days. 

As for hobbies:

-macrame 

-wire wrapping though I’ve essentially forgot everything I learned back in 2020 

-paint pouring

-levitation wand (I’m very new so if you are a flow artist I’d love to flow together and learn some stuff! And will have a massive backyard)

-thrifting though I’m on a low-buy year in 2025 so very few things I’m allowing myself to buy

-I’m interested in refinishing a table but I effectively know nothing and also can’t do hours of manual labor. But if tools are involved to make it easier that would be a diff story. If you’re into refinishing wood tables lemme know!!

-interested in learning crochet and signed up for a beginners class at that fiber art store near Banjo Coffee on January 15. Maybe we can be crochet and tv/talk buddies?

-I’ll be spending the year learning more about health and nutrition as I’m on a weight loss journey currently (will primarily be eating a low carb, animal based diet). If you’re on a similar journey perhaps we can support each other.

-I like to read! Mainly scifi/fantasy/dystopians (but I’m sorry; I could not get into ACOTAR lol the smut part of it was a bit too much for me 😂). But I’ll read a lot of other types of books as well. Anyone have a book club goin?

-I am trying to get into journaling/junk journaling this year

-I like to go to the movies at AMC (the ones with recliners) and been thinking of signing up for the A list thing again for a cheap form of entertainment through my no buy year. Any avid movie goers??

-def want to plan more camping trips so hit me up if that interests you

-def will be going to more shows in 2025 since I’m not really limiting my spending for experiences (well, within reason lol). I mainly go to EDM shows (Seven Lions being my all time fave since 2011) but I also like emo rock, indie, folk, some pop, some of the more pop country, some r&b. Really just don’t like super hick sounding country music or rap. I love going to music festivals too (camping or otherwise).

-more hiking. I have a parking pass for stone mtn through March. I also go to Appalachian Trail Days every May in Virginia. Lemme know if you’re going too!

Idk that feels like a good place to stop. Oh and I forgot to mention above I’m very liberally minded and looking for friends with similar morals and values who respect human dignity and rights. 

Cheers to 2025 you guys, I think it’ll be a good year of change for me. Hoping for good stuff in the new year for you all as well. 😬",9,1735759035.0,DecaturGA,0,1.0,False

","This morning I woke up, day one of my period. I took a sip of coffee and went to make some toast. A few minutes later I had this wave of weakness/nausea come on. I felt like I needed protein immediately (low blood sugar) so I quickly got a glass of almond milk. 
I started feeling terrible cramps and the urge to poop and faint at the same time. I started sweating and shaking alternating with chills. I had to take breaks from the toilet to lay on the cold bathroom floor, but I did end up doing several bms even though I thought I was going to pass out. 
This all lasted about 20 minutes, and I’ve been laying down since, having cramps come in waves for the last 30 minutes- I’m starting to feel normal again, with average cramps.
What. The. Hell. Was. That. 
It was so scary And my partner wanted to take me to the hospital but at the time, I wanted to give it a little more time.

About 2 weeks ago I was feeling a pressure in my lower abdomen and imaging told me it was an ovarian cyst. It hasn’t been bothering me since and I haven’t felt a big rupture. I was wondering if today’s episode could have been a rupture without me feeling one big bang? Maybe they’re unrelated.
If anyone has experience with this or thoughts on what could have happened to me I’d really appreciate it. It was terrible.",1,1735758989.0,endometriosis,1,1.0,False
1hra1wy,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1hra1wy/husband_is_always_angry_takes_it_out_on_me/,"Husband is always angry, takes it out on me","Gay married couple here. Married now for almost 13 years. Seems we always been rocky because husband is always angry at the world and uses me as a punching bag. But lately has gotten worse and now it even seems he gets mad because he thinks to seem to know how I’m thinking or for simple stupid things like he got home from the gym and coffee wasn’t made. Or the other day he argued that I’m forgetting about our relationship because I don’t have time to do groceries and cook anymore. 

I do get that over the last six months I’ve been more distracted or busier I guess - in May of 2024, I had my first major lost of my life, I lost my grandmother to suicide and it’s taken a toll on the entire family. Not only that, but all of that happened in the middle of a big career and job change. New job is in Sales, so more demanding and requiring me to be out of the house more. So yes, I’ve have been busier and more distracted getting used to a new life and a new normal while coping with a trauma. I made this job change for both of us and we both knew what it was going to require before I took the step and ultimately to build a better future for us. But seems he is not supportive at all. Or he is frustrated that I’ve gotten so independent that he doesn’t feel needed and feels insecure. 

I don’t know how to feel. Because he makes it seem like it’s all my fault, the other day I went out with a friend and I asked him if it was okay, he agreed and when I got home he had the other room ready to sleep in and he said “the l only reason I agreed for you to go out was for you to feel stupid and see how you are forgetting about me” then went on to delete all pictures of me from his instagram. Seems everything is a test. Or sometimes takes things I like or even watch on tv and uses them against me in arguments like “you sound fake when you argue, like the movies you watch”.  

It all feels very back and forth, seems we never get anywhere. He gets in my head half of the time and then I feel guilty. Not sure how to feel anymore. 

Tl;dr - husband is always frustrated and seems to take it down on me to the point that it almost feels abusive. Gay marriage, Expects me to be cooking and do things around the house, but have been busier with a new job and it’s acting like he’s not supportive. ",5,1735758936.0,marriageadvice,3,1.0,False

At current this area is our kitchen, dining, and family room (hanging out and watching TV. We are embarking on a small addition, in the lower level, which would allow us to have a more appropriate TV viewing area.

We'd like to change this seating arrangement to be more focused on sitting with family, friends, and talking, sitting by fire, listening to music (turntable is in the built-ins), and reading.

  
**Would love recommendations on:**

1. Layout  -- e.g. should we arrange furniture perpendicular to fireplace

2. Furniture -- we are ok with replacing the sectional and the gold chair, but not sure if we should do a small couch and two chairs, what to do for a coffee table 

3. Floor covering -- we love our existing rug, but open to other considerations, sizes, placements

  
*Other considerations:*

1. Dining table will stay in current place

2. No major modifications (e.g. not removing or moving kitchen island)

3. We do have some pretty nice furniture that's underutilized and could be used. 

* Knoll Saarinen Executive Arm Chair (x4) currently in an orange fabric similar to [these](https://rarify.co/cdn/shop/files/23020906-2.jpg?v=1713843152&width=416). Would be open to reupholstering. 
* HBF Dialogue [Lounge Chair](https://www.hbf.com/products/seating/dialogue-lounge-chair) (note: no ottoman) currently in leather robin's egg blue.

4. The TV will stay (yes, it's mounted too high, mistake on my part). My wife regularly uses it for Apple Music playlists

I did not do rankings, in part because most of my stays met or exceeded my expectations for the brand. A couple hiccups here and there, but overall the service and quality of the hotels was what I’d expect from each brand.


**Thompson Washington D.C. x5**

One of my favorite uses for a SUA, especially for long stays! When booking a regular king room, I was upgraded to a junior suite twice. Location is solid for most activities in D.C. Quick walk to the Navy Yard metro stop and great restaurants in the area. If you can get a reservation far enough in advance, check out Albi. 

Breakfast is consistently excellent and while they were pretty slow a few times last year (20+ minutes for takeout orders), that doesn’t seem to be an issue anymore. The barista Andrew is so sweet and always on top of things in the morning. Globalist breakfast is the typical one entree, one juice and one hot or iced coffee. No espresso drinks, though. Sometimes I order an extra side or get a pastry + fruit cup as my “entree” without any problems. Highly recommend the short ribs on the weekend brunch menu!

Housekeeping can be pretty slow with requests for additional bedding or pillows and I’ve had to ask multiple times to get a single extra pillow. Maintenance, however, is very quick. One night we had an issue with the TV and the evening maintenance guy fixed it within 10 minutes. The valets are attentive and helpful, always proactively loading/unloading bags and opening car doors, even if you aren’t parking a car there.


**Hyatt Centric Arlington x2**

This hotel is a bit hit-or-miss. I’ve stayed here 12+ times in the last three years, so I’m pretty familiar with it now. The location is great for metro access. There’s a semi-hidden door at the corner of Wilson and Ft. Meyer that makes it very quick to get to the metro, especially nice when it’s cold/rainy because you spend less than a minute outside while walking from the Rosslyn station to the hotel. Rooms are fine. The b bathrooms feel more dated than the rooms with shower curtains that make you wonder “is this supposed to be beige or is it yellowing?” In the summer, the rooms have a slight DC humidity mildew smell (okay, I know it’s in Arlington), but in the winter they have no noticeable odor. A weird high point of this hotel: they provide some of the best hotel robes around. Super thick, warm and actually absorbent if you want to use them after a shower. Pro tip: Compass Coffee down the street usually has Nespresso pod samples in a bowl on the counter. I always grab a couple if I get coffee there and use them in the hotel’s machine!

The breakfast buffet is consistently great for what is otherwise a fairly mundane hotel. They offer many rotating dishes and two or three rotating egg options every day, in addition to the omelette station. Chocolate chip pancakes one day, then blueberry, then banana. Chorizo and eggs one day, the next chilaquiles, the next eggs benedict, all in addition to plain scrambled eggs. I appreciate that it’s not all the same each day! The little smoothie cups are always great. They often have whole figs, a big bowl of raspberries and orange supremes, which I think is a lovely touch. The breakfast staff is always friendly, attentive and usually remembers my room number after the first breakfast of each stay. My only complaint is that there’s no pickup or to-go Globalist breakfast option, only the buffet.

My most recent stay this month was a little frustrating. I arrived at noon and the front desk worker said there would be an early check-in fee. I asked “Even for Globalists?” She said “Globalists get complimentary late checkout, but not early check-in.” I then asked if any two-queen rooms were available at the moment (I had technically been upgraded to a high floor 2-queen, but I would have taken any 2-queen room). She said yes, they’re available, but I would still have to pay a fee to check in before 4 p.m. I showed her the priority room access benefit on the app, at which point she made my keys and let me check in to the high floor 2-queen early for free. That being said, my coworker checked in the following day at 9 a.m. and was not asked to pay a fee. I also asked five times in two days for an extra blanket and never received it.

I’m gonna sound old here but… the one thing I truly hate about this hotel is the motion-sensor bathroom light. I want my middle-of-the-night pee to happen in total darkness! But I’ve stayed here enough times to master the “close your eyes and reach around the corner to turn the light off immediately” move.


**Hyatt Place Amarillo x2**

The room itself was clean, comfortable and surprisingly quiet given how many families with children were staying at the hotel. Breakfast was your typical Hyatt Place offering (with great seasoned potatoes!), but you could tell the staff was struggling to keep up with the speed at which food was being consumed. There were so many kids in the hotel, I felt like I was eating breakfast at a Chuck E. Cheese.


**Mission Pacific Beach Resort**

Booked a cash rate with SUA, got upgraded to a premium Bohemian suite. Ocean view with a huge balcony was incredible. We slept with the balcony doors open so we could hear the waves. I loved that the room had real dishes and utensils, a microwave, larger fridge and separate freezer. So easy to heat up our leftovers!

Breakfast at The Seabird’s Piper was delicious, but our takeout order one morning was missing condiments for pancakes and the hot sauce + ketchup I’d asked for when ordering via phone. Then when they did give us butter and syrup for the pancakes, the syrup was very cold like it came straight out of the fridge, so I was happy to have a microwave in the room. I highly recommend the chilaquiles with pork, they were fabulous! I also loved the breakfast sandwich. I booked a rate that included $30 for the rooftop bar, so we got two desserts. They were both beautiful and full of flavor!

We opted to park in the $5 lot across the street and yes, you have to go back out there at midnight to renew your ticket. Worth it given the valet price, in my opinion. The Seabird spa was… fine. Pretty sparse as far as amenities go with only a sauna, a mist shower and some “heated” benches that were lukewarm at best. My husband loved reading and relaxing on the balcony while I got a massage.


**Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego**

Great location and one of the best club lounges around. I was told no suites or bay view rooms were available, so they gave us a corner room that actually had a great view of the bay from the couch. We’re usually the kind of people who eat a late hotel breakfast and then have a nice dinner out while traveling, so it’s really convenient to have some snacks available in the middle of the day and save our “food money” entirely for dinner. Highly recommend Edgewater Grill in Seaport Village.

We also did the harbor tour that’s included in the destination fee and you can pay like $5 more to make the one-hour ticket a two-hour ticket. Worth it if you enjoy a river cruise! The military and scientific research vessels were pretty cool.

One low point: I asked for late checkout during check-in and then on checkout day again confirmed we would be able to check out late, but our keycards were still deactivated TWICE between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. 


**Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor**

I had low expectations going in, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The room was clean, bedding didn’t feel cheap, pillows weren’t paper thin. Location was perfect for the conference I was attending and I liked being able to walk to Whole Foods for a quick lunch. Only downside was that housekeeping was “by request” and you had to make the request before 9 a.m. We did ask for extra towels twice and both times they were promptly brought up to the room within like 2 minutes. Breakfast was the typical Hyatt Place spread. Nothing particularly bad, nothing particularly excellent. Pretty much right on par for the brand.


**Hyatt Regency New Orleans**

Booked a king room, got upgraded to a junior suite with a great view. The breakfast buffet is impressively large and the stipend for takeout breakfast was generous at $30/person considering the prices are very reasonable. Oddly enough, their chia pudding is probably the best chia pudding I’ve ever had. The berries on top were plentiful and perfectly ripe.

Only major downside to the room was the air conditioning situation. The junior suite has a dividing wall (no door), but the air vent is on the far end of the living room area, so there’s very little circulation in the bedroom area and it was noticeably warmer in that part of the room. Turning the A/C down as low as possible eventually cooled the bedroom area off. Small gripe is that the couch seemed old. It was sagging a bit and felt kinda grimey.


**Hyatt Place Dallas / Las Colinas**

Perfectly…… adequate for a Hyatt Place. I stayed one night just for the EQN, in part because the stay also gave me an extra 2,000 points during a promo. Pillows were quite flat and the walls were very thin. The people staying in the room next to us had a very opinionated small child and we heard about it aaaaaall night. Good birth control, I suppose.


**Grand Hyatt DFW**

Stayed for one night before an early flight. We ordered burgers from the restaurant and they were perfectly cooked and juicy! I loved that they proactively gave us those cute little glass jars of both mayo and ketchup. We also were upgraded to a suite with a runway view, which my husband loved. The room was huge and very quiet, though the bathtub was small and unusually shallow.

If you’re not departing from Terminal D, you do have to take the actual airport shuttle to the other terminals. We waited 15 minutes for the shuttle, so factor that into your timing if transferring terminals.


**Hyatt Centric Downtown Portland**

Oh, Portland. Look, I understand that addiction is a disease and often the result of untreated mental illness, but I didn’t love handing my car keys over to a valet with pupils the size of dinner plates.

Aside from that, the hotel was pretty nice. Felt a little industrial with all the metal and concrete. No suites available, but after an unusually long time clicking around, the front desk worker told us there was a corner room available. It was barely more spacious than your average king room, but large enough to fit us and a dog comfortably. Street car was right below us, but the noise was never a problem at night. The breakfast burritos are hefty and actually pretty good for non-Texas breakfast burritos. Delicious food within walking distance at Sunrice and Tanaka!


**tommie Austin**

Solid location for going to Austin, but the tommie itself is pretty bare bones for the price. Don’t stay here for the room. Stay here for the pool and the location. The rooms are very small. The sink is in the room while the shower/toilet area is separated by a wall that isn’t completely opaque, so you better really love the person you’re sharing a bed with. Highly recommend Kristen Kish’s Arlo Grey and the amazing tacos at Veracruz.

Breakfast was great and when we stayed earlier this year, they were still doing unlimited Globalist room service breakfast. I’ve seen some people say that has since stopped. There’s no coffee maker (or tea), but we did have a hot water kettle with two Copper Cow coffee pouches. There’s also “cooler” instead of a mini fridge that’s barely colder than room temperature and no ice machine, though you can call down for a bucket of ice. We also went to the two art museums included in the destination fee, both of which are walkable from the hotel and are a great way to kill an hour and see some beautiful art.


**Hyatt House Dallas/Frisco**

I begrudgingly spent a week here while our power was out and it was actually a very pleasant stay. One of the cleanest Hyatt Houses I’ve ever stayed at. The bed was comfortable, housekeeping was thorough, and the room was very quiet. The front desk staff — especially Isaiah! — was helpful when we wanted to extend our stay every day for 5 days in a row. While I initially booked a studio king, they let us move to a 1-bedroom suite after the second night while I continued to pay the lower room price. Very thankful for that because two people in one room being on two separate Teams calls at the same time is… a lot. The laundry room is incredibly handy and I appreciated being able to get quarters from the front desk via room charge.


**Hyatt House Denver/Lakewood at Belmar**

I decided to burn a SUA on our weeklong stay here to get a 1-bedroom suite. Worth it! The location is perfect if you don’t need to be downtown. The little lake nearby is great for a long walk and birding. We went to a concert at Red Rocks and it took us about 20 minutes to get back to the hotel. I may or may not have ordered a metric ton of food from Curry Kitchen, so the little kitchenette was handy for heating leftovers a couple times. The laundry room was again very handy, though at this HH, they couldn’t do a room charge for quarters.

The parking situation was weird. The parking lot behind the hotel is also the Target parking lot. The hotel website says this about self-parking: “These spaces are clearly marked as Hyatt House parking spaces. If no spaces are available, please use the complimentary parking garage across the street.” We parked in the garage the first night, but then realized that the Target lot still had 80+ cars well after closing hours. We then parked in the Target spots for the remainder of our stay without a problem.


**The Shay**

When they sent the Globalist welcome email, I asked if they had any available 2-queen patio rooms for an upgrade. They said no, but asked if we would like the king suite with a balcony. Since my friend didn’t mind the sofa bed, we accepted the upgrade. I really appreciated the upgrade two days before check-in! 

The suite bathroom is HUGE and the soaking tub was soothing after long days of activities. My friend also asked for an extra blanket and it was delivered within 5 minutes of placing the request on the app. I stayed right before the change in restaurant ownership, so the food was good but the service was abysmal. Can’t really blame them for that, though. It’s hard to care about a job when you know you’re not going to be there next week.


**Hyatt Regency DFW**

Booked a king room, got upgraded to a standard suite. Truthfully I find the HR at DFW more convenient than the Grand Hyatt unless you’re leaving out of Terminal D. The HR shuttle was much faster than taking the actual airport shuttle from outside the GH if you have to go to another terminal anyway. We left before breakfast hours, but we enjoyed the suite upgrade and the welcome gift that included chips, a cookie, and a couple other little items that I can’t remember. Gum, maybe?


**Andaz Prague**

I absolutely LOVED our stay here. The location is truly perfect for sight-seeing. You can walk or take the streetcar pretty much anywhere in the city. Only downside is that the suite room description said it had a bathtub, but our room had no tub. I didn’t care enough to ask about changing rooms, but just FYI, not all junior suites have tubs. The teapigs super fruit tea they have in the rooms quickly became one of my favorite herbal teas.

Breakfast buffet has so many delicious options and the room service breakfast is generous. Order whatever you want and you only have to pay the delivery charge. The filled croissants are perfect! My husband loved the avocado toast too. The “refreshing smoothie” lives up to its name as well.


**Párisi Udvar Hotel Budapest**

Delicious breakfast options available via room service, just pay the delivery fee. The “corner suite” is less of a suite and more of a large corner room. The afternoon tea at the restaurant is reasonably priced, fun and pretty tasty!

Like an idiot, I forgot a couple things in a drawer and they were able to mail my items to the PH Vienna, which was greatly appreciated. I did have to pay for shipping, but it was less than what the replacement cost would’ve been so I was perfectly happy to pay it.


**Park Hyatt Vienna**

Contrary to what some people have said about this hotel declining,  
I found the service very quick and definitely friendly by Austrian standards. The concierge Stephan was always proactive about offering us cold (and still!) water as we headed out for the day. When we inquired about where to buy stamps for postcards, the concierge told us that the hotel would mail them for free and they did! Then when I told them I would hopefully have a package arriving soon from Budapest, they said they'd put it in our room when it arrived and if it arrived after we left, they could also mail it to us at home for no charge. Thankfully it showed up on the final night of our trip and was waiting in our room when we returned from dinner!

Room service breakfast was plentiful and always on time. Their banana bread is probably the best banana bread I’ve ever had. And that fresh apple juice? Wonderfully tart and refreshing. Turndown service was great and clearly paid attention to the type of water we were drinking because they started leaving us extra bottles of still water every day. They also refreshed our tea and coffee twice a day, which I appreciated.


**Hotel Kansas City**

Truly a hidden gem among Hyatts. Breakfast was SO good. The miso french toast?! Amazing. My husband said the breakfast sandwich was one of the best he’s had in a long time. I booked a suite using points and a SUA, but they upgraded us to the 1-bedroom loft suite, which was huge and stunning. We were traveling with my in-laws and brother-in-law, and they all loved the rooms. Breakfast charges were wiped clean even though we ordered some sides and fed a third adult in our room. They also didn’t charge us the pet fee! Housekeeping and maintenance were very attentive and quick. I had trouble with the ice machine and the housekeeper who saw me struggling with it called maintenance immediately. They had it fixed less than 5 minutes later and knocked on our door to let me know the ice machine was working again.",12,1735758786.0,hyatt,8,1.0,False

1hr9wq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1hr9wq1/wakefulness_and_fasting/,Wakefulness and fasting,"Had a very odd experience yesterday. I have been diagnosed a type 1 narcoleptic w/ cataplexy for about a year now. In the last few months my condition has gotten significantly worse. I cannot stay awake for longer than 3 hours without needing a nap. I have always been sleepy but I am noticeably more sleepy lately.

I was speaking with an endocrinologist friend who was spitballing some ideas with me - because I have tried every medication under the sun to no good effect. He suggested that perhaps my increased sleepiness (ie: the recent deterioration of my narcolepsy) might be related to increased insulin resistance that becomes more prevalent later in life. I have a family history of diabetes and have exhibited symptoms of increasing insulin resistance. He suggested SGLT1s might be something to consider if at a dead end.

To test the theory, yesterday I decided to try fasting all day. Except for lunch, I ate nothing and drank only water/coffee. The only significant sleepiness that I experience came after my lunch - where I was constantly ebbing and flowing between wakefulness and sleepiness. I still had a 10min nap in the morning but in the evening it wasn’t until around 11pm, when having a robust political discussion with my family that I realised I was not even slightly sleepy (by this point it was probably 8 hours since my previous nap). When everyone around the table realised that I was indeed still around the table (and not asleep) it was a very weird feeling. 

Going to continue fasting to see if it was a one off, but has anyone had any success on SGLT1s/reducing their caloric intake?

It was probably the most excited I have been about managing my condition other than the first day I took modafinil (which was the only day it seemed to work for me).",1,1735758568.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False
1hr9wmm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hr9wmm,Cup a coffe via the app,"Not sure if I am doing this post correctly and am new to reddit but I want to share my confusion over the inability of ordering on the Starbucks app(!), a dark roast coffee at any store. The store has the dark roast coffee at the store (walk up) but I cannot order it on their app. I posted two pictures to show what happens when ordering online. 
It has been over six months of this and I have contacted corporate about this issue. It appears Starbucks is now using a single (made to) order coffee machine. Btw, they have broken down in the past which means an Americano ($$). My situation is not unique. I have tried it on family and a friend’s app. It is infortunate that they (corporate) have not dealt with this issue. It should not be difficult ordering a ‘basic’ coffee through a coffee store’s app! Thoughts and comments…😬 TY ",3,1735758560.0,starbucks,15,0.59,False

1hr9ux5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hr9ux5/ive_met_someone_else_away_from_my_marriage_and/,I've met someone else away from my marriage and now I'm confused,"First post on here. I am 40 and have been married for 12 years. Generally been happy but we've never really had what I would describe as a spark (We don't have sex or kiss or anything like that as she says he doesn't like being touched). About 6 months ago my wife saw that I had been unhappy and said to me that if I was unhappy I should go and that it would be fine. This surprised me a little as we don't really row but I do get quite down from time to time. I play tennis and shortly after I met someone at the tennis club I'm a member of. She is 26 so quite a bit younger than me and also in a long term relationship (8 years). We talked a lot after tennis on the car parkand I got a few silly drunk texts one night from her but as the weeks went on we were texting all the time - not flirty texts just life stuff but there were hundreds of them every week and talking for an hour after tennis each week. This went on for a few months until she said something another member had said to her and I told her that it was nice that I'd got to know her so well. I think she thought this was a come on and said she was sorry if she'd led me on. We agreed to be friends until a week later she said to me that she had thought about us being together but because I was married etc etc. She text me the following morning to say that she'd had crazy dreams about me and if she saw me away from the tennis club she would want to do stuff with me. I suggested we talk about it rather than text but then she text me a few days later to say maybe we should keep our distance.

I started to feel quite a bit of guilt for my own marriage at the fact I'd fallen for someone else even though nothing had happened physically. I told my wife about the lack of spark and she just replied that it's just her way (lack of affection).  About a month ago we talked again and I said something needs to change in the new year and she got upset and went and told her family, some friends and work colleagues that I was leaving in the new year which has caused a shitstorm over Christmas.

I didn't speak to the woman from tennis for over 2 months until about 2 weeks ago when we exchanged a few message and she said she'd split up with her boyfriend. I told her my marriage was on the ropes and we exchanged lots of messages over 2 evenings. The messages got more and more lively for want of a better word. Most of it was banter but we talking about what we'd name our kids, where we would live, go on holiday etc and she ended the night by saying she'd dream about the holidays I'd take her on. She even said I could stop at her house if I wanted. I obviously felt a lot of guilt for this because of my marriage situation. She messaged me the next day to say that because I was still in the same bed as my wife and her boyfriend hadn't moved out of their house yet that maybe we should talk about it in the new year. Just after Christmas she sent me a video at midnight after she'd got in to show me that her ex had taken the sofa, tv etc and asked if I wanted to play tennis the next day. We met and played tennis and talked about our respective situations at home. As we were leaving I asked if she wanted to do something in new year, like go for a drink/coffee etc but she didn't really say anything. I text her a few hours later and she said that she only really liked playing tennis with me and talking. I said how much I liked her and how confused I was with how she felt about me (such as all the messages about holidays, stopping with her etc). She said that she works in a male orientated business and that's just how she speaks to people, which I personally think is rubbish. I made light of it though.

Now I am wracked with guilt and confusion because my wife is a lovely, kind person but we just don't have that connection as we should. I know as a couple we will be fine but I have, I know wrongly, fallen for someone else who I think has feelings for me but is maybe not completely showing them. I really don't know what to do next so any advice is most welcome.

I’m used to the cold and darkness so the weather isn’t an issue, and I lived in London for 10 years so am used to city life. Ultimately, I want to be in a place that has plenty of coffee shops I can walk to and write in, a literary scene and a general buzz (somewhere where other creatives live so I can feel like I’m in the middle of the action). I plan to attend gym / yoga classes and walk / explore a lot. 

Which would suit me best? I’ve been to Edinburgh before for weekend trips and found it magical but I’ve never been to Amsterdam. However, I know it’s where Quentin Tarantino wrote Pulp Fiction, which inspired me. ",1,1735758344.0,travel,6,0.6,False

Okay, so you’ve been a bit of an a**hole in the past. We’ve all been there, trust me. Maybe you ghosted someone, made that awful comment about their cooking, or just generally acted like a jerk.

Grab a cozy blanket, a comfy chair, and let’s figure this out together.

### Chapter 1: Own Your A**holery

First things first: You’ve got to own it. Like, really own it. You can’t just shrug it off like it’s no big deal because guess what? It *is* a big deal! Ignoring it is like trying to sweep a mountain of dirty laundry under the rug. Spoiler alert: It’ll just keep piling up and eventually suffocate you.

**Steps to Ownership:**
- **Reflect:** Take a moment to think about what you did. Be honest with yourself. Did you hurt anyone? Did you just make a bad decision? It’s cool, we’ve all been there!
- **Breathe:** Okay, don’t hyperventilate. Yes, it’s uncomfortable to face your a**holery, but you’ll feel so much better once you do.
- **Apologize (with Finesse):** A half-hearted “Sorry, not sorry” doesn’t cut it. Be sincere. Like, “Hey there, I messed up and I want to make it right.” Make sure they know you really mean it.

### Chapter 2: Be a Better Human

After you’ve shoved your ego aside and accepted your faults, it’s time to hit the reset button. Think of this like updating your software (but, you know, more personal). Find ways to be a better human being, starting today!

**Redemption Homework:**
- **Engage in Random Acts of Kindness:** Hold the door open for someone. Buy a cup of coffee for the person in line behind you. Don’t be creepy about it, though. No stalking people with kindness! 
- **Help Someone Out:** Whether it’s volunteering or just lending a hand to a neighbor, find ways to contribute positively. You’d be surprised how a little help goes a long way.
- **Listen More:** Become a professional listener! Practice active listening by nodding your head, making eye contact, and avoiding the urge to check your phone. Remember, you’ve got two ears and one mouth for a reason!

### Chapter 3: Surround Yourself with Good Vibes

Let’s be real; you’re not going to turn your life around by hanging out with the same toxic crew that encouraged your a**hole behavior. It’s time for a little friendship detox!

**Tips for a Fresh Start:**
- **Identify Your Squad:** Look for people who uplift and inspire you. You know, the ones who make you laugh, but also call you out when you’re being a jerk. Keep them close.
- **Distance Yourself from Toxicity:** If someone brings out your inner a**hole, maybe it’s time to hit the eject button on that relationship. It’s not about being rude; it’s about self-caring. 🍂
- **Join Groups That Give Back:** Whether it’s a community service organization or a book club for social justice, find people who are doing good in the world. Plus, you might make some cool new friends! 

### Chapter 4: Cultivate Self-Compassion

Guess what? Just because you’ve been a jerk doesn’t mean you’re *doomed* to wear that label forever. Learning from your mistakes doesn’t happen overnight. You’ve got to give yourself permission to grow.

**Self-Love Tips:**
- **Forgive Yourself:** You screwed up; now let it go. Holding onto guilt is like holding onto a grudge—it just drags you down.
- **Practice Self-Reflection:** Journaling is a great way to process your thoughts. Write down your feelings, what you've learned, and how you plan to be better. Bonus points if it includes doodles!
- **Celebrate Small Wins:** Did you resist the urge to be a jerk today? Throw yourself a mini-party (even if it's just a dance break in your living room).

### Chapter 5: Keep the Good Vibes Going

Redemption is not a one-time event; it’s a way of life. This isn’t an “all-you-can-eat buffet” where you can have a taste of kindness and then retreat to old habits. No! This is a lifelong journey. 🌈

**Become a Good Vibes Ambassador:**
- **Keep Learning:** Stay open to new experiences and ideas. Sometimes, the biggest lessons come from the most unexpected places.
- **Share Your Story:** Don’t be shy about your a**hole past. Sharing your experiences can help others—and it might just earn you some goodwill in return.
- **Stay Humble:** Always remember where you came from, and let that guide you in moments when temptation arises. Your humility will stick with you longer than your ego ever will!

### Conclusion: You’re Not an A**hole Forever

Look, we all mess up. What matters is how you choose to rise from those ashes like a majestic phoenix or, you know, a really cool pigeon. You’ve taken the first step toward redemption, and that’s something to be proud of. Growth is a journey, not a destination—so buckle up and enjoy the ride! And remember, being an a**hole in the past doesn’t define who you are now. You're on your way to greatness, my friend. Embrace it! 🦄✨

# ""Stressed Out""

The house still smelled faintly of the candles his mom used to burn. Lemon verbena. Tyler walked through the living room, his fingers brushing the familiar curve of the couch, the battered armrest where he’d slouched through countless Saturday cartoons with Josh. Now it was just… empty. Same old furniture. Same creaky floorboards. But without the chaos of childhood, it felt hollow. Like a memory that didn’t want to be remembered.

Tyler sat at the dining table, his eyes trailing over the faded wallpaper, his dad’s old coffee stains on the wood grain. The same table they used to sit around as kids, chugging root beer and arguing over who’d win in a fight—Batman or Spider-Man. He almost smiled at the thought. Almost.

He pulled out his notebook and pen, flipping through pages of half-sketched lyrics, fragmented thoughts. A line stared back at him in scrawled handwriting:  
*“Wish we could turn back time…”*

He leaned back, sighing. Turning back time wasn’t an option. Rent was due, his boss was riding him harder than ever, and every voicemail from his parents carried the same undertone of polite disappointment: *When are you going to do something real with your life?* He couldn’t answer that. He didn’t know himself.

The front door creaked open, and Josh stepped inside. He looked just as drained as Tyler felt—messy hair, dark circles under his eyes. He kicked off his shoes without a word and flopped onto the couch, fishing a can of soda out of the plastic grocery bag he’d brought.

“Long day?” Tyler asked, though he already knew the answer.

Josh snorted. “Is there any other kind?” He cracked the soda open and stared at the ceiling. “Sometimes I feel like I’m living the same day on repeat, you know? Like I’m stuck in some shitty time loop. Work, home, sleep, repeat.”

Tyler nodded. “Yeah. It’s like… we had all these dreams when we were kids. Thought we’d make it big. Thought life would be better. But now…” He gestured vaguely at the room, the weight of adulthood hanging heavy in the air. “We just work to survive. I don’t even know what we’re surviving for anymore.”

Josh took a long sip and sat up. “You know what we need?”

“What’s that?”

“A break. Like, a real break. No bills, no deadlines. Just us… being kids again.”

Tyler smirked. “You got a time machine in that bag, too?”

Josh grinned, but there was a flicker of something serious in his eyes. “No, but I’ve got a plan.”

They ended up in the driveway, sitting on the curb like they used to when they were ten, knees skinned and hearts wide open. Josh had dug an old Big Wheel tricycle out of the garage, the red plastic faded to a pale pink.

“This thing’s barely holding together,” Tyler said, poking at the wobbly front wheel.

“Yeah, but so are we.” Josh hopped on, his knees practically in his chest as he pedaled awkwardly down the street. “Come on! Get the other one!”

Tyler laughed for the first time in weeks as he grabbed his old green tricycle and followed. The cool night air rushed past them as they raced down the quiet neighborhood street, their laughter echoing off the darkened houses.

For a moment, it didn’t matter that their dreams were on pause or that life was pulling them under. For a moment, they weren’t drowning in deadlines and expectations. They were just two kids again, riding tricycles under the streetlights, the stars above them indifferent to all the noise in their heads.

Tyler’s mind drifted back to those lyrics in his notebook. Maybe he couldn’t turn back time, but he could freeze this moment, tuck it away in the corner of his heart where it wouldn’t fade. He glanced at Josh, who was now singing at the top of his lungs.

“Wake up, you need to make money!” Josh yelled, his voice cracking with fake drama.

Tyler laughed so hard he nearly crashed. “You’re the worst singer I’ve ever heard.”

Josh grinned over his shoulder. “Yeah, but I’m the best at reminding you to live a little.”

And for the first time in forever, Tyler thought maybe that was enough.",0,1735757907.0,ChatGPT,1,0.5,False

I've been writing letters back and forth to people on 5 continents for almost 8 years now, I've got 200+ plus letters and post cards from roughly 50 different countries and I'd love to welcome more conversations into that fold! While the collection of the paper is fun, I really enjoy the stories and moments from day-to-day lives. I personally have no age, location, or time frame requirement (though points in your favor if you can speak french!). I want to know the minor things in life that make you happy, in the same way a cup of coffee makes me happy. If you're looking to start your penpalling, please know I'm more than happy to be the first. :)

As for myself, I love everything, especially being in the PNW! Hiking and camping are some of my biggest hobbies. It all started as a wee cub scout at the age of 8, but I've been on so many camping trips and hikes across these few states I can't even name them. I love to take my car, my WRX, out with me, and actually do photography for my other social media accounts. I work in an Audio Shop, installing speakers and various custom stuff for folks, but my love for all things music started with Jazz. I've been playing Trumpet for close to 12 years now, It's taken me so many places including the opportunity to have fun at Pixar Music studios in California.

I'm currently in school to be an Electrical Engineer. COVID kinda knocked my timeline out of whack, so I'm just now really laying into it. I've got a fascination with all things science. I sat on the board of directors for a local Marine Science center for a couple of years and have multiple aquascapes I modeled after various local freshwater lakes. I have access to multiple high-end 3D printers and love to include little knick-knacks in my letters.

My favorite method of writing is Fountain Pens, I own dozens and am currently obsessed with my Lamy LX writing some Kon-Peki Iroshizuku ink. Before I felt confident in my handwriting though, typewriters were the instrument for my written thoughts. I've got a small collection, including my personal favorite an Olivetti Underwood Lettera 33 I got from a restoration shop in Seattle.

TLDR: I'm a nerd and I love taking in as much of the world as I can with the time I have left.

(almost certainly),"First off, sorry about the long post, but I hope the details give good context. 5-time book reader, going on 6th right now and listening to 2hrs of Corey per day on average.

I've been seeing this girl that I go to salsa with for 3 weeks now (I've known her for 2 more months prior to that). We always spend around 18-24hrs when we meet (we meet around 6pm, have drinks, come over to mine, chill, she stay the next day so we got for coffee, walk around, etc). We spend a lot of time together easily and she shows high level of interest (7-8). When she sleeps over, she fits my sheets, folds the clothes I give her to sleep in, she even brought me cookies she baked the other day in a nicely wrapped little foil with a Christmas tassel!

Now, here's a timeline of what happened:

* 30th: she slept over the night before and left in the afternoon to go to her grandma's place - she didn't really want to leave, but it was a family thing so she went (e.g. she wants to stay around me as much as possible - high interest level; it's not the first time that's happened, I usually need to tell her that I need to go to the gym so she leaves lol)
* 31st: she sent me a picture of something we spoke about (how to pronounce Worchester sauce) - I teased her a bit and joked around (I also have the feeling she didn't get one of my jokes - I told her ""My mum's always told me I'm special 🤓"" \[which obviously means I'm stupid, right?\] and she replied ""Hahah yes yes I agree with your mum 😊"") because I didn't want to invite her straight away to a date seeing as she had just left yesterday. Plus, I had this idea of her reaching out to after NYE and me going to see her for a ""new year kiss"" (I now realise having this expectation backfired massively, but somehow I was certain she'd do it) so I never set a date, instead told her that I need to run off to see the boys and wished her an awesome evening. Wasted opportunity.
* 1.30AM after NYE I sent her a text wishing her a happy NYE, etc. (she initiated the text on Xmas)
* 6:45 she replies in a similar kind manner to mine wishing me lots of smiles and adventures in 2025
* 8:45 I reply ""Thanks! How about we meet up on Saturday at 5.30pm in front of yours \[she lives 10mins from me\] and start working on those smiles? :)""
* 13:50 she replies ""Okayyy although I think I twisted my ankle a lil bit 😅 but I hope it'll heal up by then 🤞""
* 14:20 I reply ""Sounds like it was one hell of a party! In that case, text me on Friday to let me know how you are :)""
* 14:37 she replies ""Hahaha yes, it was awesome, there was lots of dancing 😊 alright, I'll text you on Friday in that case!""

My 2 questions are:

* *Would you have set a date when she first reached out on the 31st?* Looking back, I really feel like I should've done that as we had already spoken about our schedules while she was here and she said she had no plans, but I didn't do it because it felt too soon somehow setting it the day after she left.
* *Does this warrant a takeaway if she says her foot still hurts?* She hasn't shown any devious or dishonest behaviour so I definitely trust her. Since we live literally less than 10 mins walking from each other, would it make sense to invite her to chill over, watch a movie and make dinner together IF she r that her foot still hurts? Or, would that come across as needy? I was thinking something along the line of ""What about a casual dinner and movie night at my place? It'll be nice to chill after a long week :)"" (she's slept over probably 5 or 6 times). Or should I just tell her to contact me when she feels better (we'll likely see each other at the salsa class on Monday)? Had the situation been different, I definitely would go for the takeaway. *However*, she leaves for the States on the 10th so this is her last weekend in my city for the next 2 months. She's done a few sweet things for me though so I don't want to make her feel like I don't care, but at the same time I feel it can come off as pushy and needy, especially after the way I tried to set up this date. I hope you see my dilemma.

I feel like I'm reading too much into this and massively overanalyzing which could have been EASILY avoided if I had just set a date on the 31st. Instead, I built up some expectations in my head which did not materialise and I may have acted rashly as a result though I don't think it's fatal. Won't do it again. She reaches out, I set a date.

1hr9j7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1hr9j7y/update_to_the_handsome_stranger_who_helped_me_at/,[Update] To the handsome stranger who helped me at JKIA on 21 Dec '24- and to the CREEP who decided to impersonate him 🙄,"Look, I need to address something that's been happening since my last post. What started as a genuine thank you note has turned into a disturbing reminder of why women can't express simple gratitude without attracting manipulative behaviour.

To the multiple guys sliding into my DMs claiming to be my airport hero: STOP. IT. Just stop. And especially to this particular dude who took this to a whole new level..😒 He slid into my DMs claiming to be my airport hero. When I asked for proof (because DUH, I remember what the real guy looked like), he sent old photos trying to pass them off as ""from years ago before the nose ring and blonde locs."" 🙄

But wait, it gets better! This clown memorized details from my post and played along, even agreed to meet up. Surprise surprise - completely different person! His excuse? ""I liked your vibes and thought I should play along."" Maybe try being YOUR OWN PERSON instead of hijacking someone else's good deed? ""I liked your vibes and thought I should play along"" is not an excuse to catfish.  Do better. Be better. Being caught lying doesn't deserves sympathy, I could've walked out on you in public but chose not to, for decency's sake.

To be crystal clear: The real loc'd, nose-ringed gentleman hasn't reached out. And that's FINE. My post wasn't a desperate attempt to find love - it was appreciation for basic human kindness, something clearly foreign to some people.

To the actual kind stranger: My offer for coffee still stands.  

To everyone else: YES, women can appreciate men's kindness without it being an invitation for every opportunist to shoot their shot. Want appreciation? Do your own kind deeds.",11,1735757612.0,nairobi,9,1.0,False

(my teeth are normally colored, i assure you😂) 
Under normal circumstances, if a dentist told me to take out my piercing because it was causing damage, i would totally listen! however, i can’t help but feel like if my dentist told me to, it would be because of his personal bias….

I don't know if I'm overintellectualising it but Dutch is my first time learning a second language and I feel like part of why I'm struggling is because I don't know how to ingrain the translations.

How do you learn to learn languages if you only grew up with one language? 

I know a few hundred Dutch words and can order a coffee or meal without small talk, but even spending tons of time in Dutch-speaking company, being surrounded by Dutch in a non touristy area, etc. I just feel so stuck!

It's almost like the physical facts of being from a country where the vast majority are monolingual and not being taught languages besides English in school makes it hard for me to approach language learning in a way that is memorised and internalised to the point I start to see good results.

Did not see a relationship status on his profile.  Was planning to have another date followed by having sex in a few days. 

Friend saw on an ig story of ST and the husband and messaged me the story. ST’a husbands IG is public and it’s all photos of them for the past few years and they’ve been married for two/three years.

There are improvements in both materials and looks but we need to keep in mind that the original came out 70 years ago

With that let’s begin our discussion of all the Cafelat Espresso Robot’s inherent flaws or what were probably design decisions to stay within scope and how to improve them.

# Usability Items

Note: None of the links provided in this article are affiliate links and are provided to make your life easier, nothing more. I'm not allowed to provide links for AliExpress so you'll need to search yourself and try to find items that look the same.

These are things that make the Espresso Robot more pleasurable to use and in my opinion increase its usefulness by quite a bit. I don’t think I enjoyed my Robot as much before I made these upgrades.

https://preview.redd.it/i31idz4dffae1.jpg?width=3516&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f31e6c48d370604327669177f35d1b50af13801d

**Robot Mittens**

The robots arms are adorable with their little robot fingers but are horribly uncomfortable to press down on creating intense pressure points. They’re probably made this way due to the need to be crafted from a piece of bar steel of a certain thickness. You can solve this problem by buying mittens. I got mine from Chompo Kitsana which makes aftermarket products for the Espresso Robot. I’d give links to each product but a lot of the URLs have Thai characters so don’t translate well. Browse the entire shop here - [https://shopee.co.th/kitsana9556#product\_list](https://shopee.co.th/kitsana9556#product_list)

They make various thickness mittens for the Robot. I got the extra larger (XL) which makes the robot a little top heavy when the arms are up. If I were to do it again I’d get the normal size. I paid about $18 for my mittens.



**Robot Arm Holders**

When you raise the Robot’s arms they don’t stay up. There are a lot of different DIY solutions to this including gluing thin magnets onto the arms so when they’re reaching up the magnets connect. Chompo Kitsana has a kit to solve this but I didn’t buy it because it was bulky. For my workflow the arms aren’t a problem. I prepare my basket, then lift both arms at the same time, reach down and grab the portafilter and put it in the Robot with one hand and push down with two. I wouldn’t mind a simple magnet solution but it hasn’t been a problem so I haven’t done anything to change it.

**Shot Scale**

The Espresso Robot was made with legs that aren’t very far apart (95mm) which restricts which scales you can use. Most of us start out with the **WEIGHTMAN Espresso Scale with Timer** or many other branded versions of it which to be honest is quite horrible to use. It does work, it’s better than nothing but I went through 2 of them before I started the search for something better. I found the **MiiCoffee Nano Coffee Scale with Timer** for $36 on Amazon. They also make a Pro version with an aluminum body for $12 more. Just like the Weightman it’s built in China and sold under many names. You can get the original plastic design on AliExpress under a bunch of different brands for about $10-$20**.** I’ve seen the aluminum version for about $35 on AliExpress.

**Pressure Gauge Relocation Kit**

The conversation about why the pressure gauge is on the Robot’s arm has come up time and again in discussion groups. Paul gets on his knees and pulls down on Robot’s arms to pull a shot. In this position the gauge is visible. For anyone who wants to stand up to pull the shot the gauge is pointing at their chest so moving it makes a lot of sense. Many people have built kits to move the gauge to the top mounting bolt that holds the arms on. I got mine from Chompo Kitsana for $9. Put a little Locktite Blue on the screw when you put it in or it will work its way out as the arms are moved up and down.

**Shot Mirror**

Along the same lines as the Pressure Gauge Relocation Kit, this one is to remedy a problem that Paul doesn’t have. If you get on your knees and pull down on the Robot’s arms you can see the bottom of the basket. However, if you stand up and push down you can’t so I bought a cheap shot mirror and I love it. The Shot Mirror came from Aliexpress and cost me all of $4 on AliExpress.

**Robot Leg Extensions**

Some people need more clearance under the Robot basket especially if they’re using a scale too. Chompo Kitsana makes several different lengths of legs. They sent me some with my order for free but I use the Nano scale and a single espresso cup so I’ve never installed them.

# Shot Consistency

Being a manual lever espresso machine the Robot gives you control over virtually everything - pre-infusion pressure, pre-infusion time, ramp up curve, shot pressure, shot timing, taper off pressure etc… Because there are so many variables just pulling a shot you have to have an absolutely consistent puck. If the puck is deeper on one side than the other or the espresso isn’t distributed just right it will channel. If the grind is too uniform the puck will lift. If you don’t pre-infuse the shot may channel (depending on beans and grind), if you don’t ramp up fast the puck may float. It’s imperative with the Robot for a consistent shot, to have a consistent puck. There are just too many variables already to have the puck add in a million more. There’s no reason to try different beans, grinders or attempt espresso profiling if you haven’t found a way to make your puck consistent. These upgrades are necessary.

https://preview.redd.it/3pvcmieiffae1.jpg?width=2783&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61387320feef5cd831efd5918138ba2236100a17

**Pressure Tamper**

Let’s be honest about the tamper, it’s quite horrible. It’s almost impossible to keep the tamper perfectly vertical making a horizontal bed of ground espresso. If the bed isn’t horizontal, the shot won’t be consistent. The standard tamper is also not very comfortable to put any sort of pressure on. Cafelat made a tamper which had a 3D printed piece that kept it level but at $70 I think it’s a lot to pay for a piece of plastic around my tamper. You can still find it by searching for **Cafelat Leveling Tamper**. I was in the process of using a lathe to turn down a 58mm pressure regulating tamper to 57.5 mm so it would fit in the Robot basket when I ordered one from Chompo Kitsana which levels and regulates pressure and is designed for the Robot for about $26. I wish it went a bit deeper but works well for an 18 gram dose.  

[https://shopee.co.th/kitsana9556#product\_list](https://shopee.co.th/kitsana9556#product_list)  


**Leveler Tool**

If you use any other espresso maker in the world you have a choice of espresso distribution tool especially if your portafilter basket is 58 mm. However, due to the very deep basket on the robot we were mostly out of luck until Chompo Kitsana started making a distributor for it. Just like the tamper I wish it were 4 mm taller but it works well extended nearly all the way if you use 18 grams of espresso in the basket. This made such a large impact on my shot that I had to adjust my DF64 with SSP Sweet Cast Burrs 5 notches courser.

[https://shopee.co.th/kitsana9556#product\_list](https://shopee.co.th/kitsana9556#product_list)  


**Wire Distribution Tool**

This is not specific to the Espresso Robot at all but necessary. I’ve tried several solutions for WDT and I’m not 100% satisfied at this point so I keep looking. Currently I’m using this one for $10 on AliExpress. 

I plan on sticking it to the bottom of my coffee shelf over my Robot so it doesn’t take up valuable shelf space.



# Other things that I use

There’s nothing special about these things but they’re what I’ve found works for me. I buy my beans 500 grams at a time and this spoon reaches in a perfect amount and scoops up beans. I kind of wish the bowl portion of the spoon was about 50% bigger so it would get 18 grams per scoop but it isn’t. I’ve bought lot of espresso spoons and settled on this one. Get the 8 ml version. I got my scoop on AliExpress.   


**Dosing cup**

When I weigh my beans I do so in a dosing cup. I didn’t like this at first and used a small glass prep bowl but since I’ve been using hand grinders so much lately this has become invaluable. It came with a water spritzer which I don’t need and a little plastic spoon which I also didn’t need. I paid $5.50 for all three on AliExpress. 

  


**Grinders**

The Espresso Robot has some special characteristics that make High Uniformity ground coffee difficult. What I experience is channeling because of the puck lifting. I believe this is because of the way the bottom of the basket is formed but since I can’t swap baskets I can’t prove it. Pre-infusion helps a ton as does ramping up to 9 bars \*immediately\* to put pressure on the puck. The thing that has helped the most was changing the grind to be less uniform. For me SSP Sweet Cast Burrs work a great deal better than SSP High Uniformity burrs in my DF64. The HU burrs channel about 50% of the time. I wasted a lot of coffee with them. Shaking the grounds before distributing and tamping helped a bit but even with absolutely perfect puck prep they’d channel. I chalked this up to a design issue with the Robot basket. Switching to SSP Sweet Cast Burrs helped a lot but even with meticulous puck prep I channel about 10% of the time. 

While researching Kingrinder hand grinders I decided to test them all. Like every combination of burrs and form factor and I found that almost every one made rock solid, perfect shots every. single. time. Really, a baby could hand grind and pull a perfect shot with the Robot.

I have so far tested the Kingrinder P1, P2, K2, K3, K4, K5 and K6 grinders either directly or through proxy (same burrs, same coffee). If I were to choose the perfect grinder to pair with the Espresso Robot it would be the K3 for internal burr adjustment and K4 for external burr adjustment. I don’t find the external adjustment to be better and it places my hand further from the crank increasing pressure on my wrist. For me \*personally\* I’d choose the K3 or if you can’t get it the K2.

I got my K2 for $62 on AliExpress.

# Robot Specific Issues

**Compression Issues** 

The top of the basket is full of air when the piston pushes down. Liquids don’t compress but air does. 

Other espresso machines push water into the brew chamber and push the air out but we add our water in an open brew chamber so that’s not possible. The more air you have in the top of your brew basket the less consistent the pressure on the water will be as it gets compressed which only gets its resistance from the puck. Excess air compounds inconsistent puck prep. 

It helps to fill the basket as full as you can with water. When the shot reaches the desired volume you manually stop the shot by lifting the Robot arms and removing the portafilter. The brew basket will still have water in it covering the shower screen so pour that out before taking the shower screen out and dumping the shot. The negative to this method is that you end up with really messy wet pucks and most puck analysis probably won’t be helpful.



**Heat Issues**

The piston is heated by the water in the basket. We don’t have to worry too much about the temperature of the brew basket itself. You can test this by wrapping your hand around it and pouring boiling water into it. It gets hot fast enough that you’ll drop it within seconds. The temperature of the water in the brew basket doesn’t lose a lot of heat either because the brew basket walls are quite thin. We also don’t have to worry about the Portafilter as the brew basket only makes contact with it at the very top ring of the basket. 

We do however, have to worry about the temperature of the piston as it’s a giant hunk of metal and makes a great heat sink, in other words it sucks a lot of heat energy out of the water in the brew basket. This is because each shot pulled back to back increases the piston temperature by about 2-3 degrees Celsius with the most drastic difference being between the 1st and 2nd shots.

A lot of people have come up with various DIY solutions.

1. Insulate the piston to keep it from heating up with a 58 mm backflush disk.

2. Preheating the piston by placing heat pads inside it.

Which method do I use? None of them currently as I pull one shot of espresso at a time so I grind for the temperature of the first shot (about 84 C). However, I will start playing with making Solution #5 more practical soon. If I can make it part of my workflow without too much fuss then I’ll implement it. 



**Shot Profiling**

The last upgrade is shot profiling. I don’t recommend going this far if you haven’t nailed consistent shots or it will be a massive waste of money. However, once you have every single shot coming out exactly the same then there may be potential in profiling your espresso shots. One device that does this is the Smart Espresso Profiler from Naked Portafilter.  The Smart Espresso Profiler connects to your smartphone and records time and pressure information. 

I haven’t purchased this mainly due to it costing nearly as much as the Espresso Robot itself!  The current price of the Smart Espresso Profiler for the Cafelat Espresso Robot is $335 USD with the larger than standard gauge. You do save the $10 on not needing a guage relocation kit so there’s that. If you want the Steampunk gauge the price is $350.

[https://www.naked-portafilter.com/product/smart-espresso-profiler-for-machines-with-an-e61-group-head-new-stock-expected-end-of-november-copy/](https://www.naked-portafilter.com/product/smart-espresso-profiler-for-machines-with-an-e61-group-head-new-stock-expected-end-of-november-copy/)



You can also have it sync up with an Acaia smart scale so it will correlate pressure information with scale weight allowing you to figure out flow too. However, none of the Acaia scales fit between the Espresso Robot’s 95 mm wide leg space although the Acaia Lunar at 105 mm long and wide can work if you place it at an angle. You’ll have to shell out another $250 USD for the scale though.



**Summary**

I believe the best bang for the buck is getting a Kingrinder K2 (or K3), wire distribution tool, Nano Scale and a shot mirror from AliExpress along with the Espresso Leveler, Pressure Tamper, Mittens and Gauge Relocation kit from Chompo Kitsana. Using this setup you can hone your skills until you are making back-to-back consistent shots and you can tweak the variables to get your coffee to do what you want. I paid about $240 over the price of the robot for all of these upgrades including the Kingrinder K2 grinder.

The next step after the upgrades is to  experiment with coffee beans from different suppliers. This particular setup will last you (literally) years without having to put another dime into your espresso setup.

I don’t find the external adjustment to be better and it places my hand further from the crank increasing pressure on my wrist. For me \*personally\* I’d choose the K3 or if you can’t get it the K2.

I got my K2 for $62 on AliExpress.

# Robot Specific Issues

**Compression Issues** 

The top of the basket is full of air when the piston pushes down. Liquids don’t compress but air does. 

Other espresso machines push water into the brew chamber and push the air out but we add our water in an open brew chamber so that’s not possible. The more air you have in the top of your brew basket the less consistent the pressure on the water will be as it gets compressed which only gets its resistance from the puck. Excess air compounds inconsistent puck prep. 

It helps to fill the basket as full as you can with water. When the shot reaches the desired volume you manually stop the shot by lifting the Robot arms and removing the portafilter. The brew basket will still have water in it covering the shower screen so pour that out before taking the shower screen out and dumping the shot. The negative to this method is that you end up with really messy wet pucks and most puck analysis probably won’t be helpful.



**Heat Issues**

The piston is heated by the water in the basket. We don’t have to worry too much about the temperature of the brew basket itself. You can test this by wrapping your hand around it and pouring boiling water into it. It gets hot fast enough that you’ll drop it within seconds. The temperature of the water in the brew basket doesn’t lose a lot of heat either because the brew basket walls are quite thin. We also don’t have to worry about the Portafilter as the brew basket only makes contact with it at the very top ring of the basket. 

We do however, have to worry about the temperature of the piston as it’s a giant hunk of metal and makes a great heat sink, in other words it sucks a lot of heat energy out of the water in the brew basket. This is because each shot pulled back to back increases the piston temperature by about 2-3 degrees Celsius with the most drastic difference being between the 1st and 2nd shots.

A lot of people have come up with various DIY solutions.

1. Insulate the piston to keep it from heating up with a 58 mm backflush disk.

2. Preheating the piston by placing heat pads inside it.

Which method do I use? None of them currently as I pull one shot of espresso at a time so I grind for the temperature of the first shot (about 84 C). However, I will start playing with making Solution #5 more practical soon. If I can make it part of my workflow without too much fuss then I’ll implement it. 



**Shot Profiling**

The last upgrade is shot profiling. I don’t recommend going this far if you haven’t nailed consistent shots or it will be a massive waste of money. However, once you have every single shot coming out exactly the same then there may be potential in profiling your espresso shots. One device that does this is the Smart Espresso Profiler from Naked Portafilter.  The Smart Espresso Profiler connects to your smartphone and records time and pressure information. 

I haven’t purchased this mainly due to it costing nearly as much as the Espresso Robot itself!  The current price of the Smart Espresso Profiler for the Cafelat Espresso Robot is $335 USD with the larger than standard gauge. You do save the $10 on not needing a guage relocation kit so there’s that. If you want the Steampunk gauge the price is $350.

[https://www.naked-portafilter.com/product/smart-espresso-profiler-for-machines-with-an-e61-group-head-new-stock-expected-end-of-november-copy/](https://www.naked-portafilter.com/product/smart-espresso-profiler-for-machines-with-an-e61-group-head-new-stock-expected-end-of-november-copy/)



You can also have it sync up with an Acaia smart scale so it will correlate pressure information with scale weight allowing you to figure out flow too. However, none of the Acaia scales fit between the Espresso Robot’s 95 mm wide leg space although the Acaia Lunar at 105 mm long and wide can work if you place it at an angle. You’ll have to shell out another $250 USD for the scale though.



**Summary**

I believe the best bang for the buck is getting a Kingrinder K2 (or K3), wire distribution tool, Nano Scale and a shot mirror from AliExpress along with the Espresso Leveler, Pressure Tamper, Mittens and Gauge Relocation kit from Chompo Kitsana. Using this setup you can hone your skills until you are making back-to-back consistent shots and you can tweak the variables to get your coffee to do what you want. I paid about $240 over the price of the robot for all of these upgrades including the Kingrinder K2 grinder.

The next step after the upgrades is to  experiment with coffee beans from different suppliers. This particular setup will last you (literally) years without having to put another dime into your espresso setup.

# Over and Under, part 1

My mom finished talking and slammed down the receiver. Not hard enough to take the phone out of the wall, but she tried her best. My father was sitting three feet away at the kitchen table, but he didn’t even flinch. “That fucking dog,” she said.

Now my father flinched because he’d heard the word ‘fuck.’

“Arthur’s right here,” he said.

“I’m fourteen, Dad,” I said. “You don’t have to talk about me like I’m five.”

“You're still a child,” my father said in his British upper-middle-class accent, the kind you only get at the best schools.

“Anyone listening to me?” my mother said.

“What dog?” I said to her, even though I knew there was only one dog that could send my mother into a rage, make the tendons in her neck stretch tight.

“That fucking O’Reilly dog,” she said.

My mother had four siblings, and together they jointly owned a small place north of Bixity, the place they all grew up in, twenty acres of unfarmed land, a small orchard, and a house that was almost falling down. The O’Reillys were the family who lived the next plots over, dirt poor like my mother’s.

“O’Reilly?” my father said, like he’d never heard the name before, had never heard my mother’s stories about the O’Reilly clan.

“The O’Reillys,” my mother half-shrieked, “I only told you about them a thousand times.”

“Oh,” my father said. “Those O’Reillys. Of course, of course,” he said, his face assuming a look of interest in what my mother was saying.

“So what have the O’Reillys done now?” I said.

“Their dog,” she said. “Their fucking dog. Your uncle Jack, he was up at the place yesterday, and the dog bit Sam.”

“Sam is what, six years old,” I said, “and that dog bit her? How? Why?”

“She was out in the orchard,” she said, “with your Uncle Jack, and that dog, he just came outta nowhere. Bit her hard. Jack had to take her to emerg, and they were there for hours.” My mother had been speaking loudly, but now she lowered her voice. “She gonna have a scar,” she said, that being the worst part of all in her mind. Scars didn’t matter as much for boys, but for girls, they were a big deal.

“What’s Uncle Jack gonna do?” I said.

My mom gave a forced laugh. “He gonna sue,” she said.

“Uncle Jack doesn’t kid around about stuff like that,” I said. Uncle Jack was a lawyer, and when he said he was going to sue, he sued. He never bluffed.

“You think the O’Reillys care about being sued? They don’t own jack shit, they got nothin’,” my mother said.

My father got up out of his chair, to get away from the bad language and from having to listen to his wife.

“Don’tchew go anywhere,” my mother said to him, fixing him in his place, “you gotta take care of this. You gotta take care of this thing.”

“What thing?” my father said.

“Haven’t you been listening?” my mother said. “You gotta take care of that dog, that fucking dog.”

“What do you expect me to do?” my father said. “Shoot it?”

It was like My Fair Lady. My mom’s mouth announced her Eliza status wherever she went. And my father? He spoke like Henry Higgins. Or at least, he thought he did.

“That’s exactly what I expect you to do,” my mother said. “I expect you to kill that fucking dog.”

“Your brother is going to sue them,” my father said, his voice low and patrician, “and he can apply to have the animal destroyed.”

“The law won’t do jack shit up there,” my mother said.

“I’m sure it’s not as bad as it was when you were growing up,” my father said.

“Can't be good, if the O’Reillys are still there,” my mother said. “Plus that damn dog of theirs, Sam ain’t the first kid he bit.”

“I still don’t understand what you want me to do,” my father said.

“Go up there and kill that thing,” she said. “You were in the army, weren’t you?”

“I never killed anyone,” he said, in this tone that implied the opposite, to make you wonder which was true.

“But you know how to shoot a gun,” she said. My father owned a German pistol that he brought back from the war. He shot it at the range sometimes.

“I’m not shooting a dog,” my father said. “That’s just ridiculous.”

He was right, of course; my mother was telling him to do something totally ridiculous. There was no way he was going up north to Queen City just to shoot someone’s family pet.

Except that my mother insisted, would not relent, talked of nothing else, filled the house with her complaints and her cries, and by Friday she had her way. On Friday my father left Bixity and headed up to Queen City to the homestead of his wife’s family, to stay overnight and to kill a dog.

We managed okay while my father was gone, hardly noticed his absence until he returned. He came back Sunday night.

“What happened?” my mother said the moment my father walked in the door.

“Couldn't find the dog,” he said, shaking his head gravely. “No sign of it.” I didn’t believe him, and neither did my mother.

“You didn’t even try,” my mother said when my father settled into the kitchen chair, apparently exhausted by his weekend labors.

“I didn’t see it. The dog was nowhere around.”

“Plus the fact you left your pistol at home.” She’d found it Saturday morning and she’d wondered when he’d notice and come back for it. But he hadn’t noticed.

“I don’t know whatchew were doin’ up there,” my mother said, “but you’re gonna go back this Friday, and this time you’re gonna take your gun with you.” My father protested and complained, but come Friday, he headed up north with my mother’s commands in his ear, telling him to get the job done.

I don’t know why my mother thought that he’d get the job done. My father never got the job done, not when the job was something that he didn’t want to do.

The house was peaceful with my father away, and I was starting to like this new family routine: my father leaving the house each Friday to drive up north and not kill a dog. It could go on forever. But when my father came back that second Sunday, I thought that my luck had run out.

My father looked grim when he walked in the door, like he’d just been through World War Two all over again. He took off his jacket and said he needed to collect his thoughts. He settled in his favourite living room chair while my mother brought him a cup of tea. She sat on the couch and waited eagerly to hear that the dread dog of the O’Reillys was dead, and how my father killed him.

“I walked all over, both days,” my father said, “no sign of it. They’re keeping him inside, obviously.” He took a very civilized sip of tea.

I studied my parents the way Russians used to read Pravda, not looking for truth, but for warnings of what was to come. I saw trouble.

“If you looked so hard for that dog,” my mother said, “why don’tchew describe that dog you were looking for, the one that bit my little niece.”My Uncle Jack was the first lawyer in the family, and I became the second, but I think my mother would have done pretty well in the profession. She certainly knew how to cross-examine.

“Describe the dog?” my father said, stalling for time.

“Yeah, describe the dog that you went out there to deal with, to shoot with that pistol of yours.”

“Well,” my father said, “for one thing, it’s big.”

He wasn’t wrong about that. The O’Reilly dog was well over a hundred pounds, all lean muscle. I’d laid eyes on it a few times, wandering the fields outside of its home, laying claim to its territory, which was basically wherever it happened to be.

“And what else?” my mother said.

“How much detail do you need?” my father said, his face aggrieved. It was bad manners to question his credibility, especially when he was lying.

“What colour is it?” my mother said.

“Colour?” my father said, in pretended confusion.

My mother threw up her hands in frustration. “You don’t even know what you were lookin’ for. Now listen, I’m gonna tell you again what that fucking dog looks like, plus I’m gonna write it out on a piece of paper so that when you go back next week you’ll know what you’re actually looking for,” and while my father sat there sipping his tea, my mother told him about the crazy O’Reilly dog, that it was big and black with short hair and big jaws. “Plus if you ever actually do see it, you better have that gun of yours on you. That thing bites anyone it can, and they shoulda put it down years ago.”

“Fine, fine,” my father said, but he hadn’t been listening. My father never listened.

“Plus you gotta take Arthur with you,” she said.

“What?” I said, appalled.

“I don’t think Arthur should see this,” my father said, his voice clipped. He didn’t look at me when he spoke. He rarely did when the subject was me. He thought I couldn’t handle much—he was sure of it. He’d seen the bruises when I came home from school, he’d heard the stories of fights I didn’t win. It shamed him, though he’d never say it aloud.

“Just take him along,” my mother said, “the two of you can spend some time together.” That’s what she said. But my father and I both knew better—she wanted me there to make sure he actually looked for the O’Reilly dog, and when he found it, that he’d shoot it with the German pistol he brought back from the war.

The only good thing about the trip was that we wouldn’t be able to stay till Sunday. We had to leave Saturday night, because we were having people over on Sunday. But surely one day was enough to kill a dog, my mother claimed.

Come Friday, I got into the car with my father for the hour-long drive up north to Queen City, and while we drove, my father talked.

“How are things at school?” he asked me when he paused for a breath twenty minutes into the trip, after telling me stories that he’d told me dozens of times before.“School’s out,” I said, “it finished two weeks ago.”

“Right, right,” my father said, launching into another story that I’d heard before.

This is what passed for conversation with my father, sitting next to him while he relived his real or imagined past. My father told his stories, and I listened to them, parsing them, sifting them for inconsistencies, trying to sort the truth from the fiction.

Of one thing I was certain: my father really was a heavyweight boxer. He was a big man, six-two, and I’d seen him get into a fight once. I’d heard stories from my mom as well. My father could handle himself, and if you pissed him off, he’d knock you out. But other than that, there was very little about my father that I was sure of.

“Damn it,” my father said, using his strongest expletive, “you made me miss my exit.” My father talked a lot while he was driving, and he missed a lot of exits.

“I was trying to tell you the exit was coming up,” I said, and I had tried, I’d really tried, but my father had told me not to interrupt him, while he told the story of how he became a fitter in a factory when he was eighteen, just before he got called up to serve.

“If you hadn’t told me about the exit, I wouldn’t have missed it. You distracted me,” he said. He got off at the next exit, doubled back, headed south for the exit he’d missed. He found it this time, and now we were driving one of the sideroads outside Queen City, one lane each way, the pavement soon giving way to gravel. My father slowed at the stones crunching underneath, and while he drove, he talked and talked some more.

My father wore the iron ring of an engineer on his finger, an amazing accomplishment considering that he’d never been to university. Now my father was telling me the story of that iron ring, how he’d left school at age eleven, working a man’s job during the day, struggling to complete his education at night, how he’d completed a program at a technical college just before the war started.  He spoke of his immigration to Canada, and his struggles to get his education recognized in Canada, and then the breakthrough, when he’d been admitted to the College of Engineers and had been allowed to wear the iron ring. The next exit was coming up, and I wondered whether my father would notice it.

He didn’t notice it. He drove right past it. Twenty minutes later he realized his mistake. “You should have said something,” he said to me, “I’m always missing exits whenever I drive with you.”

There was a bonus to my father whenever he missed an exit: it gave him more time to talk. He talked all the way to the crumbling homestead of my mother’s extended family. By the time we rolled up the long driveway, the sun was setting and I was starving.

“Damn it,” my father said.

“What’s wrong?”

“I forgot the gun,” he said, adding that he knew he shouldn't have brought me, because whenever I was with him, things always got complicated.

My father would have to go back for the gun. That meant an hour’s drive back home and another hour back to the homestead, two more hours in a car with my father. “I’ll wait here,” I said, preferring the company of an old, dark house that smelled of mold.

My father didn’t try to change my mind. He was gone so fast that I didn’t even have time to ask him for the keys to the place. He reversed the car down the long dirt driveway, and then headed out on the gravel rural route.

I walked up to the house, my stomach growling. When I tried the front door, it was firmly locked, and so was the back. But I’d snuck into my own house often enough, and it was a breeze to get a basement window open. My skinny teen body squeezed through, and I landed on my feet on the dirt floor of the basement, welcomed by an odor of rot and decay.

I’d been in the house lots of times. My hand went to the light switch, and when I flicked it, the basement was lit in the faint light of a solitary, dim bulb. There was an old laundry tub, a furnace, and a locker shut firmly with a big padlock. There was almost nothing down there, and certainly no food. My stomach growled again. I headed up the creaking stairs into the kitchen at the back of the house. There was an old rotary phone on the wall. I picked up the receiver, hoping by a miracle that there’d be a dial tone, so that I could call my mother and tell her to give my father some food to bring up north.

But there was no dial tone. The phone hadn’t been connected in years. My stomach growled again, and my mind began to calculate the odds that when my father returned in two hours, he’d bring food with him.

The odds were against it, of course. My father rarely remembered what he was told and did not plan ahead. But he wasn’t completely neglectful; there was a genuine chance that when he returned, he’d bring food enough for the weekend, or at least something for dinner.

I decided that it would come down to exactly when my father felt hungry. If he headed straight home for the gun, and then got hungry on the way back, it was a pretty good guess that he’d remember to get me something.

But if he got hungry on the way down, he’d stop for a burger at a roadside drive-through, and without his hunger to remind him, he’d return to the house empty-handed. I considered the odds, and decided that they weren’t very good.

“Let’s see what we got here,” I said to myself. I tried the fridge first, but there was only a small carton of stale milk. I tried a cupboard. Inside were a small collection of old, cracked dishes, along with mouse turds. I closed the cupboard and tried another. It was completely empty, except for some more mouse turds. But the last cupboard delivered: an old jar of peanut butter, and a box of crackers.

I opened the crackers first to see if they were sealed inside a plastic bag, and thus safe to eat. The bag was unbroken, and although the crackers were old and stale, they were edible.

I opened the peanut butter, and saw that it had settled, the oil floating on top. But peanut butter is basically indestructible, and after I stirred it for a while with a spoon that I cleaned with cold water and then sterilized on the stove, I had a jar of something I could actually eat. I headed down a small hall, past an ancient upright piano and into the living room.

There was an old couch with a coffee table in front of it, covered in fast food wrappers and empty drink cups, the relics of my father’s last two visits.

I sat on an old couch, pushing away bags and crinkled wax paper, and clicked on an ancient black-and-white TV, and while I waited for my father, I ate stale crackers lathered with peanut butter, changing channels until I found an American channel.

I fell asleep watching Paper Moon, and when I woke up the next morning I saw that my father had returned and come into the house without waking me. When I checked out the kitchen, I saw the remnants of the fast food he’d brought with him. I checked the old fridge, but there was only the same small carton of milk gone bad. My father had brought nothing for me.

I’d never gone hungry at the house before when I’d visited it with my Uncle Jack. My parents left me with him sometimes when they went on vacation, and Uncle Jack would take me and his own kids up to the house. We’d walk the fields around the property, and while we walked and his young children played, he would answer my questions about the law, and what it was like to be a lawyer.

There was no coffee, no milk, no tea, no nothing, so I sat on the old living room couch with nothing but water to drink, reading random old copies of Reader’s Digest. 

I read a story about a broke farmer, out of options, saves his crops with a last-ditch plan, the neighbors rally, and he doesn’t die, and another story about a teacher helping a kid win a spelling bee. 

The stories were wholesome and inspiring and boring as fuck, and by the time my father came downstairs, I was starving, because my little dinner the night before of of old peanut butter and stale crackers had not quite hit the spot.

“Shall we go for breakfast?” my father said, standing tall in the hallway, speaking the invitation primly, like we were in a mansion and not a homestead that a few years later would be torn down to stop it collapsing.

“You’re eating like a starving wolf,” my father said after the waitress put a plate of food in front of me, and I ate the first real meal I’d had since leaving my parents’ home.

“Sorry,” I said, crumbs flying.

“Don’t talk with your mouth full,” my father said.

I didn’t talk at all for the rest of the meal. I just ate, and listened to my father eat and talk and drink coffee, and chum with the waitress and charm her with his accent and tell her about how he came over from England in forty-nine, but he hadn’t lost his accent, he said. Still the same accent, he said, but that was not true. It was an outright lie that he told to strangers.

The year before I heard another accent come out of my father’s mouth, when we were over at his mother’s for Christmas, and against my father’s wishes, she’d put on an old record for everyone to hear. A record made at the Big Exhibition, back in nineteen forty-nine, at a booth where, miracle of miracles, you could talk into a microphone, and they’d make a record, an actual record, right on the spot. My father said that no one wanted to hear it, but my grandmother disagreed, and when she put the record on the turntable, I heard my father’s voice as it sounded when he was fresh off the boat.

His accent was strong and broad, with some sounds that we didn’t use on this side of the water. On the recording, my father spoke rapidly and with excitement, and for the most part, I could not understand him. Gone was the voice I’d grown up with. There was none of the speech of the doctor or solicitor or university professor, only the common tongue of the working man.

“Never heard an accent like that, ‘cept on t.v.,” the waitress said. My father smiled, glad that his accent had done the work for him. He was a gentleman, his accent said, and the ring on his finger said that he was an engineer.

The accent was fake, the ring was genuine, and his qualifications were shaky. But the waitress didn’t know any of that, and my father was happy.

We finished breakfast, and my father said we had to go to the Canadian Tire. He had to buy something, he said. I asked him what.

“When I got back last night and brought the gun inside, I realized it only had two bullets. I have to buy some ammunition,” he said. We drove to Canadian Tire, and I waited in the car outside for my father to buy ammunition. It was a long wait.

“Some Canadian Tire,” my father said when he returned.  

“But they sell lots of ammunition,” I said.

“The pistol is a Mauser, nine millimetre. They don’t have nine millimetre in stock.”

I had a solution. “You know, Dad, Uncle Jack said he keeps a gun in the basement.” It was an old over-and-under, a twenty-two on top, and a four-ten shotgun on the bottom.

My father turned and looked at me sharply. “You haven’t fired that gun, have you?” I assured him that I had not, oh no no no, not at all, never.

“Good,” he said, and having delivered the obligatory reproach in response to an idea that was not his, he sunk once more into his own monologue. “Now where am I going to get ammunition,” he said. He’d already forgotten what I’d just told him.

“Dad, why don’t you use the gun in the basement?” The twenty-two wouldn’t be much good for killing the dog, but the shotgun was perfect, a lot better than my father’s Mauser with one bullet in the chamber and one in reserve, in case my father missed.

“If it’s like the rest of the house, I wouldn’t trust it,” he said. My father hadn’t thought of the gun, and that meant it wasn’t a good idea.

“Uncle John told me he keeps it in order. Says it’s been in the family since like forever.”

The gun was a Savage, and I’d fired it lots of times under my uncle’s watch. The gun was light, not much over five pounds, and the kick from the shotgun wasn’t much at all. It fired birdshot, and when I shot the paper targets my uncle set up, it left a six-inch hole.

“Show it to me when we get back,” my father said, and when we pulled into the homestead, I led him down to the basement, and I pointed to the locker in the dim light of a bare lightbulb dangling low. My father walked over to the locker and tried opening it. It rattled, but the old padlock kept it firmly shut.

“It’s locked,” my father explained.

“Can’t you get in?” I said. Maybe my father was not really qualified as an engineer, but he had been a fitter in a factory just before he got called up at age eighteen. Surely he could get in.

“Don’t see how,” my father said.

Maybe my father was looking for an idea, for a suggestion of some kind. “Couldn’t you just remove the hinges?” I said.

For a change, my father didn’t reject the idea outright. He looked at the hinges, old and rusted, and pulled at their pins with his bare but powerful hands. “Wish I’d brought my tools with me.” He turned to me. “Why didn’t you say there was a gun up here? I would have brought my tools if you’d told me.”

We looked in the basement for tools, but the place had been stripped clean of anything useful years before. All we could find was an old hammer. My father tried to use the claw to lift the hinge, but all he got for his trouble was a cut on his hand when the hammer slipped.

“Damn,” he said, holding his hand, his face writhing in pain.

My father wasn’t very good with tools, which was a bit strange, seeing as he had been made a fitter at the factory by the time he was eighteen, his career cut short by the war. But he wasn’t that good with tools, even when he had the right ones, and improvising was not exactly his thing.

“So what are we going to do?” I said as we stood in the kitchen.

“I’m going to another Canadian Tire, a bigger one close to Bixity. I’ll be back in a couple of hours.”

“But—”

“Just stay here,” he said, and then he was gone. When he came back, it was almost noon.

“I see you found something to eat,” he said when he walked into the kitchen, carrying a small box of ammunition and nothing else. I was eating more peanut butter and stale crackers.

“So can we go look for the dog now?” I said.

“I’m going by myself,” my father said, while he loaded up the Mauser’s magazine.

“But Mom wanted us to go together,” I said.

“Together to the homestead, but she didn’t mean for you to watch me kill a dog. You shouldn’t see something like that.”

This was not good. My mother had sent me up there to make sure my father killed the dog. I knew that if I stayed in the house, the dog was in no danger. “But can’t I just—”

“Don’t quarrel with me,” he said. He put the gun in his jacket pocket and headed out the back door. I watched him head toward the hill at the back of the property, past the targets that Uncle Jack set up for me to shoot at, past the old shack that my mom’s granddad had lived in, and then he disappeared over the hills and into the old, neglected orchard.

My father loved walks, and he was going for a walk in the country, and I knew with certainty that the dread dog of the O’Reillys was in no danger that day.",7,1735756790.0,Calledinthe90s,1,0.89,False

I was always nervous to try plain Oolong because people said it was smokey, and that sounded gross to me. But in my tea sampler loose leaf advent calendar, I had a plain Oolong Tea. So I tried it, and it was actually really good. Not smokey at all. Definitely earthy, but not too much, and not grassy either. Tastes slightly like black tea, but not really. I don't know, it's kind of confusing, but I definitely like it. 

I have had the premade cold Peach Oolong Tea from the JustICE tea brand in a glass bottle before, and I love that one, but it's kind of expensive to order premade bottles of tea, so I'm looking for an alternative. I will get more of the plain one too, but I also want a peach one. 

The one from the calendar was High Mountain Oolong I think? I'll check later. So whatever that tastes like (not too strong, not too bitter, balanced and smooth), with a hint of peach, and just mildly sweet. I tried looking it up online myself, but there are too many options! I need advice from all you experts over here. I am a tea lover too, but not nearly an expert. So, let your recommendations and descriptions fly! Help me choose please! ☺️🍵

I find not many coffee shops know how to make a cortado ,"It happens way too often. Luckily, the shop closest to me makes a cortado every time but there’s another one I go to a lot that’s half an hour away but they have the best espresso/coffee that I’ve ever tasted so I always get a cortado so that I can really taste the espresso. But I find when it’s someone young or someone inexperienced on the espresso machine that day, I end up with a cappuccino instead which has tons of milk so you cant even taste the espresso. This has happened at other coffee shops too so it’s not just this one. Any advice? 

Edit: I only order it if it is on the menu. I just don’t think most baristas are trained how to make them for some reason ",14,1735756527.0,espresso,25,0.82,False

I told my dad something that she did (leave the house for an hour to go hang out with some guy in MY CAR) but she left to go hangout with that guy at night when my dad was gone so I was the one taking care of my siblings (5f, 12m, 16m) and yesterday while my parents were at the store my dad brought it up that the guy she was with was using some sort of scanner on my car (because she told me the dude was) and she called me instantly and asked if I told my dad, and I was confused at first but then she hung up and when they got home she got into a screaming match with me and my dad and saying because of me their marriage is over. 

Later on they had a talk and concluded they’re gonna get divorced (they always say this, never do) and she also told me that she doesn’t trust me anymore because I told my dad what she did. what’s really bothering me however is that she’s now ignoring me, being passive aggressive to me, doesn’t care or ask if I eat, only asked and gave my brothers and my little sister food and is just being really weird and passive aggressive to me. 

It’s making me feel really anxious because I don’t know when the next time she’s gonna explode, and I used to have to constantly walk on eggshells around her but now that’s amplified by 100x. I hate this, my dad and brother told me it’s not my fault she got caught cheating and that she can’t put the blame on me but i still feel super horrible inside and I hate that the new year is starting off like this. 

I’ve never had a good relationship with my mom but I feel like the little progress I’ve made now has completely gone backwards and I don’t know what to do. I’m scared it’s going to affect my schooling (i’m homeschooled) and my life and I really, really need advice. Thank you reddit!

UPDATE 1: I was just eating lunch and I asked if we had coffee creamer (we were out) and my dad told me my mom got some so I thanked her, and she just turned away not looking at me and gave me a thumbs up. I hate this, I hate living here and I hate being here with her.

Tomorrow my dad goes back to work and i’m scared that she’s gonna take her anger out on me and just scream at me nonstop tomorrow and I won’t be able to get any schoolwork done because of her. Idk what to do :(.",4,1735756429.0,Advice,28,0.75,False

Sorry in advance mods if this isn’t allowed, I just thought I’d ask fans first on here first (since I’ve seen a few requests for the anthology on here!) before trying to sling it somewhere random like eBay or whatever. 

I’m moving and selling a ton of my books, and one of them includes the Hannibal Ravage fan anthology published by Love Crime Books. It’s an absolutely massive 400 page coffee-table book sized full-color zine. Had a limited print run, and as much as I love it there’s just no room for it where I’m going. 

If anyone’s interested in buying it let me know! I’m USA based, and would really would like an actual fan to get it since I’ve seen some obscene resales online. The cost I’m hoping to sell at  is same cost as the Kickstarter tier I paid (150 USD), but that’s negotiable. I’d also be happy to throw in some unused/pristine condition Hannibal prints that don’t have a home if anyone wants them :)",2,1735756077.0,HannibalTV,0,1.0,False

However, around 23 to 24, I decided to slow down and focus on myself, especially after dealing with depression and the loss of my father. Now that I’m in a better place, I’m ready to get back into dating.

Online dating hasn’t worked for me, so I’ve shifted my focus to meeting people in person. The challenge is that where I live, there aren’t many social events or clubs. We only have one or two beer-only bars, and I’ve been avoiding alcohol due to personal reasons and my medication.

I’ve usually avoided hitting on people at work because it feels unprofessional, but it seems like my options are limited. Interestingly, my confidence is still intact when it comes to complimenting men—I used to be bi, and giving basic compliments helps me build myself up again.

Today, I went for coffee with my friend Ryleigh at Barnes & Noble, which is a combination coffee shop and bookstore. I go there almost daily, so it’s likely I’ll see the same staff, including this cute barista I felt was out of my league. I complimented her on her nose, which she seemed to appreciate. While I was ordering, Ryleigh mentioned to her that we were just friends, and I confirmed it directly. After that, the barista’s demeanor changed, and she seemed more engaged.

At that point, she noticed the book I had with me, even though it was face down, and asked if it was Ninth House. I told her it was, and she started recommending a book she was reading, which I ended up buying. At one point, I even asked her if she wanted to chat more about recommendations since I don’t read often. She started saying yes, but Ryleigh unintentionally shifted the conversation before I could follow through. Even if that hadn’t happened, I froze and didn’t know how to ask for her number.

Now I’m wondering how I can recover this situation since I’ll likely see her again at Barnes & Noble. How do I approach her smoothly? And even beyond this situation, how can I build my confidence for future interactions?",1,1735755987.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

 Little Rock, Arkansas Craigslist: A Local's Handbook to Getting Bargains

In case you're a dweller of Little Rock, Arkansas, and you're aiming to nab some exceptional bargains, you might want to think about exploring Craigslist. Ever since 1995, Craigslist has served as a go-to platform for purchasing, vending, and swapping commodities and amenities locally. With its easy-to-use interface and broad array of categories, Craigslist presents numerous opportunities to discover distinct items at unparalleled prices. In this write-up, let's explore how you can exploit Craigslist to unearth fantastic bargains in Little Rock, Arkansas.

Navigating Craigslist

To commence, visit the Craigslist website and opt for the Little Rock, Arkansas section. You'll encounter a variety of categories, covering items for sale, services provided, housing, employments, and more. In case you have a specific item in mind, utilize the search bar to refine your choices. For instance, if you're on the lookout for a pre-owned vehicle, enter ""pre-owned cars"" into the search bar to view a register of accessible automobiles in your vicinity.

While inspecting listings on Craigslist, it's pivotal to exercise prudence and be on the lookout for fraudulence. Although Craigslist has introduced measures to lessen deceptive activity, it's still imperative to be cautious. Be cautious of bargains that appear too good to be true, and never transfer funds or personal details to someone you haven't met in person.

Items for Sale

One of the most sought-after categories on Craigslist is the ""for sale"" segment, where you can stumble upon a diverse assortment of items, from furniture and gadgets to attire and collectibles. Numerous vendors are motivated to swiftly discard their goods, so you may have the opportunity to negotiate a reduced price. Moreover, you can arrange alerts to be notified when new items in your desired category are listed, enabling you to be one of the first to seize an excellent deal.

In case you're seeking furniture, you can pinpoint everything from couches and tables to bed frames and bookshelves on Craigslist. Numerous sellers simply aim to clear out space in their homes, so you might stumble upon quality pieces at a fraction of the cost of purchasing new. Just make sure to meticulously inspect the item prior to making a purchase, given that there are no assurances or warranties on Craigslist.

Gadgets are another prevalent category on Craigslist, encompassing everything from smartphones and laptops to gaming consoles and televisions. When procuring gadgets, it's prudent to meet the seller in person and test the item before parting with any funds. This can aid you in dodging acquiring a non-functional or pilfered device.

Apart from furniture and gadgets, Craigslist also serves as an exceptional platform to procure clothing, accessories, and collectibles. A multitude of sellers are keen on decluttering their homes and might be inclined to sell top-notch items at discounted prices. Stay alert for designer brands and vintage pieces that you won't encounter elsewhere.

Services Provided

In addition to procuring goods, Craigslist also offers a valuable avenue for finding local amenities in Little Rock, Arkansas. Whether you're in need of a repairman, a pet minder, or a coach, you can pinpoint a broad range of providers on Craigslist. Numerous individuals and small-scale enterprises employ Craigslist to advertise their services, frequently at competitive rates.

While engaging a service provider on Craigslist, it's pivotal to carry out your due diligence. Authenticate the provider's references and reviews, if available, and arrange an in-person meeting before committing to any work. Clearly communicate about the scope of the project and the terms of the agreement to avert any misunderstandings.

Housing

In case you're scouting for a fresh abode, Craigslist can serve as a valuable resource for discovering leasehold properties and residences for sale in Little Rock, Arkansas. The housing segment on Craigslist encompasses listings for apartments, houses, and condos, with choices to suit various budgets and preferences. You can employ filters to narrow down your search by price, size, and location to pinpoint the perfect place for you.

When in pursuit of housing on Craigslist, it's vital to be cautious and alert. Scammers occasionally utilize false listings to attempt to obtain your personal information or funds, so always authenticate the legitimacy of a listing before pursuing it further. If a deal appears too good to be true, it's prudent to err on the side of caution.

Employments

Craigslist also stands as a renowned platform for discovering employment prospects in Little Rock, Arkansas. The employments segment showcases a broad array of openings, ranging from part-time gigs and freelance assignments to full-time roles and apprenticeships. Irrespective of whether you're in search of a role in retail, hospitality, education, or any other industry, you can come across an assortment of options on Craigslist.

When applying for employments on Craigslist, ensure to thoroughly scrutinize the employer and the position to ascertain legitimacy. Research the company and check for any reviews or grievances before scheduling an interview or furnishing personal details. Additionally, exercise caution regarding any job offerings that necessitate upfront payment or appear too good to be true.

Pointers for Utilizing Craigslist

When utilizing Craigslist to unearth bargains in Little Rock, Arkansas, there are several guidelines and best practices to bear in mind. Here are some pivotal tips for leveraging Craigslist effectively:

1. Employ specific search terms: While sifting through listings on Craigslist, deploy specific search terms to aid in narrowing down your choices. For example, if you're on the lookout for a vintage record player, type ""vintage record player"" into the search bar to view pertinent listings.

2. Act promptly: Exemplary bargains on Craigslist have a tendency to be swiftly snapped up, hence it's crucial to act promptly upon encountering something of interest. Expediently get in touch with the seller to schedule a meeting and secure the item.

3. Negotiate courteously: When making an offer on an item, be considerate and rational in your negotiation. Most sellers on Craigslist are open to bargaining, but it's crucial to approach the process with finesse.

4. Arrange secure meetings: When meeting with a seller or service provider, always opt for a secure and public location, such as a coffee shop or a local establishment. Refrain from meeting at someone's residence or a secluded area.

5. Trust your instincts: If something feels awry or too good to be true, have faith in your instincts and proceed with caution. It's preferable to be safe than sorry when using Craigslist.

Conclusion

Craigslist can serve as a worthwhile resource for seizing exceptional bargains in Little Rock, Arkansas. Whether you're in need of furniture, gadgets, amenities, housing, or employments, Craigslist presents an extensive array of options for discovering what you require.

1hr8tof,https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/1hr8tof/eavesdropping_on_a_woman_talking_about_her/,Eavesdropping on a woman talking about her inability and lack of desire to take care of elderly father,"I went out for a morning coffee (Happy New Years, folks!)

I’m enjoying my delicious chai when I overheard (then starting blatantly eavesdropping) the woman next to me talk about her father’s expectations for her to take care of him in his aging years.

She raised a few points.
1. She doesn’t have the training for this
2. They don’t have a relationship 
3. She doesn’t have the money to leave work and take care of him 

At this point, I left to enjoy my morning but I can’t help but feel for her. How many parents don’t have a 401k/retirement plan because they expect kids to do it (ESPECIALLY daughters)?

To give up pivotal moments of their own careers and their own 401k/retirement planning to take care of ailing parents? To give up opportunities to be their own person. Additionally, taking care of an aging/dying person requires more medical training, it’s not like watching a functional kid. 

I see so many people call younger generations “selfish” for every reason despite not acknowledging the burdens they’ve shifted onto them.

She says she wants it to look like it rests going down his leg and becomes especially visible when he sits.

She wanted me to emphasize that it is supposed to be played realistically and seriously. Her exact quote was ""it' should be realistic enough that he could wear it out in public and be impressive/draw heads.""

My husband and I are heading to Hawaii/Big Island for the first time here soon, and I think we have a decent itinerary lined up that hits the big things but leaves room for spontaneity. Any feedback or suggestions would be incredibly appreciated! We’re looking for natural beauty, unique experiences, and good bites along the way: we enjoying hiking and have 4WD the latter half of our trip.

**Day 1:** Arrive early evening to Westin Hapuna Beach

**Day 2:** Spend day enjoying resort and Hapuna Beach, potentially take a small hike on the Ala Kahakai Trail. Dinner at Mauna Kea or Westin Hotel (Not sure what our best options around here are). *Anything special within or in walking distance of these hotels we should see?*

**Day 3:** Enjoy resort and beach. Night Manta Ray snorkel with Ray Advocates

**Day 4:** Checkout and pick up a Jeep in the AM. *This day could go one of two ways depending on how rough the water is.* Either way, dinner at Merrimans and wind up around Hilo for our second hotel.

* Ideally, we’d love to rent a double kayak and snorkel gear through Ehu and Kai Adventures and kayak around the Captain Cook Monument area. Super J’s for lunch.
* If the water seems unsafe, we’re toying with checking out a coffee plantation, Lava Lava Beach Club, Kona Cloud Forest Sanctuary, and Waipio Valley Lookout.

**Day 5:** Get up early and head to Mauna Kea to watch the sunrise. No other specific plans this day, so some possibilities are exploring Hilo side beaches, a coffee plantation (if not done precious day), and maybe checking out Punaluu (if it’s worth making the trek there?)

**Day 6:** Get up early and head to Volcano National Park to see lava flow (if still active). Either way we'll explore the park then visit Volcano Winery. Any final activities we haven’t had chance for yet.

**Day 7:** Hit up Hilo Farmers Market before returning car and heading to airport for departure.

A few specific things I’d love some opinions on are:

* If the Kilauea is still active, what is the best way to see lava flow? It seems that arriving before sunrise is recommended so that’s what we’re aiming for.
* We’ve decided against whale watching since we’ve done it before in Monterey Bay, but if it truly is spectacular this time of year I would totally go again.
* We love exploring local foods and dishes. It seems from this sub that some places to potentially check out are Super J’s, Punaluu Bake Shop, Kona Chips, coffee Plantations (Mountain Thunder, Greenwell, Paradise, or winners from Kona Coffee Cultural Contest), and possibly Lava Lava Beach Club for views. Anywhere we are missing? Not expecting much from options at Westin or Mauna Kea so any thoughts on best choices there would be fabulous.

I said no and she casually asked if it was a friend with benefits since we were so close. Now at this point I felt quite uncomfortable cause even if I was seeing someone it's nobodies business. I got upset and told her that if she came to interrogate me, she can leave. And not to come uninvited again.

The second bedroom is going to be made into an office. I a perfect world we would both have a private space to work. I am wondering if it is too complicated to share this space?



Background

I have a dog and a cat. He is allergic to the cat, however his allergies have gotten a lot better and continue to. We want to try and keep the pets out of the bedrooms (will be an adjustment for them) but they will be okay. 





Initially I thought it made most sense for me to have the office. 

1. I could keep the cat’s litter box, food, etc there to keep her more confined
2. I would then still be able to see my pets throughout the day when I work (my pets really help with my mental health) 
3. If I worked in the bedroom, they would be alone all day, which would especially be difficult as they adjust to the new place. 
4. He owns a small business. He works a few hours a day but often leaves throughout to workout, run errands, work from coffee shops. 
5. I am typically working at least 9 hours a day, with a lot of video meetings. If I worked in the living area vs bedroom it would be difficult with him being in and out all of the time.





I expressed this, but he isn’t budging on the office because he has always wanted a WFH area. I can also understand that it gives him a place to have alone time (can get time away from both me and the pets).



With this, I think it could make the most sense to share this office space. Whether it be a few days a week he has it, or every other week we switch. I especially want to work from that area when we first move so that the pets can be around me. 



He thinks with us both having multiple screens that it doesn’t make sense to share. However, I don’t foresee a big issue having two screens at both desks and just moving our laptops to wherever we are working. 



He has also never had a roommate or lived with a girlfriend so I think the space could be for him mentally, which I get.

Two years ago, January 2022 I was 22 and started dating a girl I met at work. We dated for a little over a year and a half. She broke up with me in July. 2024. It just wasn’t working anymore. This was my first real relationship ever. She was my first everything. Naturally, I was completely and utterly devastated. 

Spent a few weeks in bed crying, moping, etc. Finally I choose to get myself back out there. I try to continue living my life. Working out, hobbies and such. I am in college. The fall semester began in August 2024 and I decide this is an excellent oppritunity to regain my composure and start living well again. But I am still by no means over my ex.

So to fast track this story I’m doing okay for a few weeks. Exercise, classes, hobbies, friends. Everythings going smooth, all things considered. Still can’t get ex out of my head of course. But hey, that’s healing right. Anyways my friends and I go out to different bars and night clubs every weekend. Having a little luck flirting with girls here and there but not over my ex at all so it never goes anywhere. One weekend my friends tell me someone from our school is joining the group for the night. A girl. Let’s call her Sam. She just turned 21 and wants to go out and party. Ok whatever. The more the merrier. 

Sam is introduced to the group. She’s a good looking girl. Sparing the details, we all go out and have fun as usual. I’m drinking. Letting loose. So loose in fact that I start coming on to Sam. The flirting is working, wow. In fact she seems more into me than vice versa. I give her my number. I’m still drinking. More lit. By the end of the night we are hooking up in the back of my car.

At this point I’m feeling good. Freshly single. Met a nice good looking girl and hooked up with her. She starts texting me. Non stop. Okay, she likes attention I guess. She asks me to pick her up from work to take her home. I do so. She’s coming on strong. Asks me to park in an empty lot. I know what’s coming, being a man I’m not opposed to it. But at this point I’m sober and have to make this clear. I explicitly tell her I am not over my ex at all and that this is strictly casual and she should expect nothing to come of this. I said this EXPLICITLY. To my surprise, rather than turning it down she doubles down. Next thing I know we’re in the backseat again.

Fast tracking again. In the following 2 weeks we hook up for a grand total of 3 times before I call the whole thing off. I am not attracted to Sam’s personality. I do not want to lead her on, casual or not. I am not over my ex, and to continue trying to fill the void that way is hurting my healing journey. I tell her I’d rather be alone. No hard feelings. 

She takes it well at first. Says we can still be friends. Then, a few days later, I hear from my friends that she was devastated. That she called a girl in my friend group crying because she expected something with me. 

Wow. Okay. I try my best do diffuse the situation. I’m nice to her at school. Go out of my way to have a chat or get coffee with her time to time. Eventually enough time passes where we are friendly and it isn’t as awkward.

Now it’s October 2024. 4 months post breakup. Feeling better about things. Start hanging out with another friend group. Things are going fine. One night the group wants to go out. Cool, awesome. We get to the place. Someone in the group brought a new friend. Guess who. At first I think nothing of it. People meet people, small world. Besides, it isn’t that awkward anymore. Until it is. She is trying to get near me all night, making eyes, etc. I’m just trying to have a good time. I’m not falling into this again. I shoot down every advance as politely as I can.

She keeps texting me. I’m trying to be nice. Cut back on texting her slowly. She starts popping up where I am at school. Be it the library, gym, cafeteria, walking to class. I just try to continue living.

November now. I start talking to this girl I met in class. She’s sweet and we share common interests. The original friend group wants to go out, I invite her to join. The night comes. Of course, Sam had to tag along with someone. The whole night she’s looking at us with a fury. Pulling all stops. Goes from trying to steal me away from her to trying to make me jealous by obviously flirting with other guys. It is awkward and my date and I have a hard time enjoying ourselves.

Through the rest of the month and December Sam has managed to make an appearence at *every* outing I have been involved in, except for obviously when I hang out with only guys. She texts me for the holidays. Talks to everyone about me trying to gain information on either myself or the girl I met. 

We are now in 2025 and she is texting me about the new year. The problem is on the surface she is nice and sweet, I am just not attracted to her and she won’t leave me alone. A few weeks ago I told her I’d rather not talk to her. She stopped for a bit. But told my friends I was being mean when she just wanted to be friendly. This is all because I made a mistake by hooking up with her months ago. It’s gotten to the point where I just wish she was out of my life. Maybe if she didn’t constantly do this I would like her as a friend but I think that ship has sailed at this point. Every corner I turn, every friend group I join, she manages to insert herself in it somehow.

Happy new year!  As I'm looking for something IRL please kindly only reply/DM if you're in Europe thank you.

I seem to be one of the older folks around here, but thought I'd give this a try.  As the title says I'm 41 from the UK and would love to find a partner to enjoy life with.  In terms of my aceishness (not a word, but I'm running with it), I'm sex indifferent, but also consider myself kink positive, but I think that's a more private conversation for down the line.  On the flip side I can consider myself to be extremely romantic and love a good cuddle.

I work in tech (like every other Redditor it seems) and that keeps me very busy, but I find myself really lonely in my spare time, hence this post.  In terms of hobbies and interests I'm a huge lover of cinema, bit of a foodie, big reader (big interest in psychology) and I love my sci-fi, oh and coffee is my main vice.  I like to get out in nature especially if there's a cosy pub at the end of the hike.

What else?  I love animals especially dogs but don't have one at the moment unfortunately, I've dealt with my fair share of challenges in my life, but like to think that I've generally remained a positive person i.e. I've become a better more considered person despite said challenges.  

Feel free to say hello, while ultimately I'm looking for a partner I don't consider new friends a consolation prize.
