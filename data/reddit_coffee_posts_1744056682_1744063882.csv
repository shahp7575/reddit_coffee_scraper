I know we only spent a summer together but you were such a formative person for me. I’ve had this notion towards life that if you just try hard enough, you can make anything work - whether that be academically, in work or your career. Perhaps it was the way I was brought up, on how I’ve tied my self-worth to achievement and doing something admirable, hence my fixation on work.

I thought I could apply that same idea to relationships, but I’m realizing some things aren’t about effort, sometimes it’s about timing, or fit, or just learning to let go without needing to fix it. I guess this is my way of coming to that realization.

That said, this city is really transient and with everyone at different points in their lives, it’s been hard to come across genuine and strong friendships. If you ever up for catching up - maybe just over coffee or a walk, I think it’d be nice to reconnect - I’ve waited to reach out until I felt ready to be friends unlike last time. No pressure if not - I hope life’s been kind to you, excited that summer is right around the corner!",1,1744063722.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

A few days ago, I was chatting with my cousin over coffee, and he casually told me he’d quit his job. I couldn’t believe it – that was his main source of income. But he just smiled and said, “I’ve found something better.” Then he showed me a post from u/KhunSG9722 that laid out a method to earn money online.

At first, I thought it sounded too simple to be true. But when he pulled up his screen and showed me he had made over $1,700 in just four days, I couldn’t ignore it.That same evening, I decided to give it a shot. I followed the steps from the post – everything was super clear and surprisingly easy to understand, even for a beginner like me. By the end of the third day, I had already earned over $950. I still can’t wrap my head around how fast it worked.

And the best part? Instant withdrawals. No delays, no complications – the money landed straight on my card without any issues. I honestly didn’t think it would work this smoothly.If you’re even a little curious, check out the original post on KhunSG9722’s profile. It’s completely free and walks you through everything.

I will do a town hall meeting with my plans which will put a life line back to the technology industry and San Fran.

Brendan Carr the current chairman of the FCC is laying fiber in the ground when wireless is the future.  This isn’t helping Americans.

I have plans for many standards that  are going to allow us to do things with technology that has not been done before, and put the FCC back in the standards game in the technology industry.

My first order of business is to put our wallets of digital information in our posession and control.  I’ll work with the Social Security office to start and make sure our social security cards, governement IDs, and banking cards are part of our wallets to start and can be used ubiquitously around the market place.   

Every American who has a social security number will have a Personal Profile.

Every city and business will have a number of applications that can be deployed to a user with a press of a button.

1jtxnlu,https://www.reddit.com/r/FearsToFathom/comments/1jtxnlu/idea_for_episode/,Idea for episode,"This story was told to me by my Fathers Uncle who has been through a lot in his life. The story takes place in the ‘60s in former Yugoslavia, in the east. My uncle’s name was Paul and I will tell this story from his perspective.

 

“I grew up in a small city in the east of Yugoslavia, my childhood best friend Marko Jouns, inherited a large farm 60 miles away from our birthplace, after we had served in the army. The farm was in the middle of nowhere, and the closest village was 6 miles away. After he moved there, we haven’t seen each other for 9 years, but we still sent letters back and forth. Two years ago he found a wife, which I unfortunately still have not met, and a year ago she had his first child, her name was Maria. And now, 9 years later I received a letter from him, but he did not sign it, instead it was his wife. The letter said that my dear friend Marko died from falling off a horse, and that I was invited to the funeral. His wife also asked me if I could arrive a day or two earlier, so I could help with some farm work. Which had been neglected after Marko’s sudden and tragic death. I packed a suitcase right away and headed to the farm in my old car.

 

It was the end of November, the month was dry, with no rainfall. That day I arrived early at dawn at the Jouns’ farm. His wife was waiting for me with their daughter, with the stableman. I got to know his wife over a warm breakfast. After the introduction, the stableman showed me my duties on the farm. Our first task was to fix the hole in the roof, which we didn’t have time to finish entirely, as there were many more duties on the farm. We were surrounded by a thick forest, and the birds were flying in flocks away from the shots of the hunting rifle. After, I had to feed the cattle, and later to forage for mushrooms in the forest, for our dinner. However, the jobs were prolonged till late in the day, and I fell asleep from exhaustion. I woke up at about 7 in the evening, and apologised to Mrs. Jouns, and the stableman for falling asleep, and said that I will go foraging for mushrooms right now. I took a flashlight and went into the thick forest. The forest was dark, but I wasn’t scared of the dark. I spent my childhood playing in a dark forest, it was totally natural to me. However, because I didn’t know the terrain and the dark I got lost. The howling of the wolves didn’t help me at all, and the fact that a boar ran right in front of me scared me for a second. After about an hour of wandering around in the forest, I ran across a steel fence. After a bit I realised it was a fence of a graveyard. I walked next to it for a bit and found a hole in the fence and went in. Right after I got in, I was staring down a barrel of a shotgun. I froze. The man started questioning me about what I was doing here, and I told him about the Jouns’, Marko’s death and funeral, and how I was helping his wife at their farm. After I told him why I was here, he stared at me for a second and then lowered his gun. He explained to me he was the guard working at the graveyard, and told me to follow him. He led me to a grave and told me to read what it said. After I read what was written, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The blood in my veins froze, and a chill went down my spine. The writing on the headstone read “Mr. and Mrs. Jouns”. The guard told me that Mrs. Jouns died about a year ago at childbirth, and after this Marko left the baby at the next village on someone's doorstep and committed suicide out of grief for his wife. I said that this is impossible, but he insisted and asked me to come to his cabin so he could explain everything. On this eerie night, we drank tea, smoked, and talked about this development. He told me that people who visited this farm never got out. I told him that none of this makes any sense to me. He got out of his old wooden chair, and walked towards the crackling fireplace. With his back turned to me, stood silent for a minute and said:

\-I think that someone moved to that farm after the death of the Jouns’ and that they present as them. The stableman wasn’t the only one living there with them, a maid, cook, and guard were living there too. The cook had coffee with me everyday, but after the tragic deaths, I never saw her again.

I told him that only the stableman was left, and he asked me if he had long hair and wore glasses. A chill came down my spine and I froze, as the stableman was bald and didn't wear glasses. He looked at me coldblooded, with sorrow and worry in his eyes, and continued.

\-The people there, after the death of the Jouns’ have committed an unimaginable evil, and God knows what they’re doing there. It’s possible that they call old friends of the Jouns’, kidnapping and killing them.

The guard advised me to stay the night with him, and to call the police in the morning and for me to go home. However, I wanted to go back to the farm to save the baby from those monsters, as I couldn’t let another night go by with the baby's life being in their hands. I asked the guard for a box of matches, said goodbye and left.

 

The desire to save the baby defied all my fears and gave me strength to confront the monsters at the farm. I threw all the mushrooms I found, and started gathering dry leaves and chestnuts.

 

As I was approaching the farm, I moved in the shadows of the forest and through a cornfield, in which a scarecrow made me fall on my back. I arrived at the farm and went into a barn which housed cattle and horses. I opened the stable doors and let them out. I threw the dry leaves on the ground, and lit them on fire. When the fire grew, I threw the chestnuts in, and started running to the other end of the farm, trying to be as quiet as possible. When chestnuts are thrown into the fire, they start exploding from the high pressure buildup from the inside. When I arrived at the other end of the farm, I started hearing the first sounds of the chestnuts exploding. The loud noises woke up all the animals on the farm, which in panic started to make loud noises and run out of their stables. The horses started galloping and running all around the farm. It didn’t take long for the fake Jouns’ to wake up and run out of the house. I ran to the house immediately to take the baby and the car keys and to run, but they locked the door after they ran out. Then I remembered the hole in the roof. I climbed some bales of hay onto the balcony, then a bullet flew right next to my head. They noticed me and started running back to the house. The fire spread quickly and soon the entire barn was engulfed in flames. I quickly got up to the roof and into the house. I started looking for the baby. When I found the baby on the second floor, they were already in the house. There was no way for me to go down the balcony with the baby, nor to somehow evade them in the house. I hid in the closet on the first floor and waited for them to go up to the second. They ran right past me towards the stairs. I waited for them to go up, when they did I got out of the closet to grab the keys which were on a shelf right next to the stairs. The baby woke up halfway to the shelf and started crying. They heard it. I heard their hastened footsteps coming towards the top of the stairs. I grabbed the keys off the shelf. I heard footsteps coming from the top of the stairs. I looked up and saw the woman staring at me with an axe in her hands. As soon as I saw her I started running towards the exit and could hear her right behind me. The man was nowhere. After getting out of the house, about 30 feet away from me I saw the man with his gun pointed right at me. He fired a shot. I turned my back to protect the baby. The bullet hit a wooden pillar. I got lucky. He was all out of  bullets, but he had a knife. I sprinted to the car and saw the tires were slashed. I had no options. I started running through the dark forest. In the distance I saw headlights. When I got closer it was a familiar face, the guard from the graveyard. I quickly got into the car. In front of us was an unseen sight, half of the farm was in flames, and two maniacs were running toward us with a knife and axe, only their silhouette was visible. The guard quickly turned around and hit the gas. Somehow I managed to escape.

 

After an infinitely long night, we went to the police to report everything, they carried out an investigation of the farm. In the house they found letters which the two sent to friends of the Jouns’. They also found something far more sinister, all the buried and burnt bodies, not just them, but also the cook and maid. The two monsters who did this, were never found, no trace, nothing. It was like they never existed. Like they were ghosts.”

 

This story was first told to me when I was visiting a distant family for Christmas. My uncle told this story to me and my cousins on the way to a hill where we sledged.

Recently, we hung out at a party where everyone knew each other. We were both drunk, she more so, and I was taking care of her. She was very touchy, asking for hugs.

Then one day he makes me listen to Clint Eastwood. And then through Blur I had my musical education for almost 25 years. And now after resisting it for decades, I fall in love with Pavement. 

So, after Gorillaz - Gorillaz I discover Blur (my favorite band of ALLLLLLL TIME lol). Then the boys introduced me to my next favorites. I started with Damon’s influences, Specials, Kinks, Clash, Smiths et al. bands with a The before lol. Even Weezer tangentially through Matt Sharp/The Rentals. 

Until I fell in love with Graham (who I’m to blame for my love for striped shit, glasses and alcohol). Then that motherfucker made me love Syd Barrett and Nick Drake. 

I always knew about Pavement but thought it was some noizey alt 90s band (and I had only place for one Sonic Youth in my head). Well, decades after knowing how they literally saved Blur from implosion in 96, I gave it a shot. And DAMN, I’m obsessed. 

Starting to look at the back catalogue and I find things that heavily influence Graham like Harness Your Hopes that kinda has the Coffee & TV / Bittersweet Bundle of Mysery (my favorite tune everrrrr) rhythm.  

Thank you Graham, Damon and the bois.

We recently moved to this house and we feel like something is missing and at the same time that we have a lot going on. 

I would like to add some accent wall, but not sure how/where, and my hubby feels like a rug and a coffee table is all we need. 

I agree with the rug, but I feel like we have no space for a coffee table, we also already have 4 tables, one on each side of the couch and 2 behind the couch, that realistically only hold trash or clutter. 

The space ship/ rocket can only be in the living room, as kiddo has no space for it in their room. 

Also we don’t have a lot of budget to change furniture. 

I would appreciate all your advice on the matter!

And so, what we thought of as a genuinely kind couple to offset all the evils of the others on her journey west was really just a set of NPCs that could be used and discarded just so long as they delivered Alex to that majestic plain. Clinical and mercenary of an ending but they served their purpose.

Hey guys,

Sorry to have yet another discussion about these two brands but I hope you can help.

I used to work in a coffee shop and really miss making real espresso based drinks. My nespresso machine just doesn’t cut it. I love the smell of freshly ground coffee and enjoy using an espresso machine.

Ideally I’d like a machine that has a built in grinder but have heard the Sage Barista Express is a decent machine but a terrible grinder. If I have to I’ll buy a grinder separate and just get a Bambino, I’ll admit its an aesthetic choice - I think all in one machines look a bit more luxurious and substantial.

So the questions I ask:
Breville vs Delonghi?
- I want a manual espresso machine with a really good steam wand for latte art. I don’t want one of those “turn it on and forget about it” types.

Are there any other (UK) brands I’m missing out on?
- So far all I have looked into is Sage/Breville and Delonghi. I wouldn’t be opposed to hearing other suggestions but I have been knee deep in like 20 machines and it can be overwhelming especially when you add on:

Separate Grinder
- I have yet to read a good review about the Sage Barista Express grinder and haven’t read up on the Delonghi equivalent yet.
- What would be a good grinder for an intermediate level?

All in all I want something stylish, enjoyable, middle ground decent. I’m not the type to be misting my ground espresso, and taking an hour to make a cappuccino, I’m not that obsessed. 

I’d also be very interested in a dual boiler so i can steam and brew together 

Machines I have looked at so far:

Sage Barista Express
Sage Bambino
Sage Dual Boiler 

Delonghi Dedica Arte

About a month ago i found out i have gluten intolerance and so I started fully adapting to my diet. A full month in since i had no gluten I got my period and I felt as if I was about to pass out from the pain the day I woke up with it. 

On top of that, i suddenly felt dizzy and weak all the time and sometimes i feel quite nauseous and close to passing out. This never happened to me before and today it got so bad that even after coffee, sugar, iron and vitamin C and magnesium it did not get better and I still feel extremely weak and am unable to work under these conditions.

Do you think my period has changed with the change in diet? And if so, how do i deal with this low blood pressure?

I love traveling and experiencing new places, but I’m also a homebody at heart—I enjoy binging movies, gaming, and just relaxing. That said, I’m always up for a good hike or a casual night out with a cocktail in hand.



I really value quality time, physical touch, and words of affirmation. Cuddling up with a good movie or anime is the dream. I’m all about shared experiences—going on walks, playing board games, bowling, exploring new spots, gaming together, and traveling. I’ve been to a few countries (Japan twice!), and I’d love to visit more with a partner who shares that passion.



A few things I’m into:

Dates: Coffee in a cozy spot, bowling, pool, mall strolls, road trips, or just wandering around an event or market.

Movies & Shows: Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, What We Do in the Shadows, South Park, Rick and Morty, Studio Ghibli films, Attack on Titan, Fullmetal Alchemist, Jujutsu Kaisen, and more.

Gaming: Elden Ring, Baldur’s Gate 3, Destiny 2, Valorant, LoL, WoW, Terraria, Stardew Valley, and whatever else seems fun.

I’ve always been drawn to the e-girl, alt, and goth aesthetics, even though I don’t dress that way myself. Just a personal preference, but not a must!



NSFW (because compatibility matters)

**You probably have no idea who I am, so let me start with a little intro. I live in North Dakota, I’m 30 years old, and I’m a passionate motorcycle rider—yeah, I know, how cliché. But here's the twist: I don’t come from a motorcycle family. My parents didn’t ride. My brother didn’t ride. No uncles, cousins, or long-lost great-grandpas ever passed down the love of two wheels. Nothing. It’s weird.**

**Most riders I meet have those classic origin stories—“My dad raced flat track,” or “My mom was part of a club back in the day.” They talk about being kids in garages, sneaking peeks while someone wrenched on a bike, or getting their first mini dirt bike before they could walk straight. Not me. I didn’t have a legacy. No worn-out leather jacket passed down. No Harley memorabilia in the garage. No dusty tool chest filled with half-used parts and old patches. Just silence. I had to find this path on my own. And maybe, in a strange way, that’s what makes it all mean even more to me.**

**I first fell in love with motorcycles as a kid—not by riding them, but by seeing them. My family didn’t fly places; we drove. Minnesota, the Black Hills, Mount Rushmore—anywhere within range that didn’t break the bank. Long, cramped car rides through the Midwest with me and my brother in the backseat, bickering or zoning out while the radio played dad’s music. And every once in a while, we’d pass them—bikers.**

**I remember watching them roll by in packs. Leather jackets, sissy bars, saddlebags stuffed with tents, cots, and God knows what else. I’d press my face against the window just to get a better look. There was something about the way they looked—sunburnt faces under helmets, bugs stuck to their windshields, road grime on their jeans—and yet they always looked so…free. They didn’t seem like people running from something. They looked like people who knew exactly where they were going. Like they had freedom in their back pockets. I couldn’t take my eyes off them.**

**Back then, I didn’t really understand what I was seeing. I was too young to process it. But it left a mark. Somewhere deep down, that image stayed with me. And years later, when I finally had a little freedom of my own—when the bills were paid, and life slowed down just enough—that memory came rushing back.**

**I started noticing bikes again. On the road. In parking lots. I’d hear the sound of a V-twin ripping through the quiet of a Sunday afternoon, and my heart would race. I’d see someone in a worn denim vest with road dirt on their boots, and I’d feel something in my gut twist—not jealousy exactly, but longing. A need.**

**It didn’t happen all at once. There wasn’t one magical day where I woke up and became a rider. It built up over time, slowly stacking inside of me until it overflowed. Until I couldn’t ignore it anymore.**

**Motorcycles, man. I don’t know why they matter so much to me. Maybe because I found them on my own. Maybe because they remind me that freedom isn’t something you’re handed—it’s something you chase. Something you fight for. And sometimes, something you build with your own two hands.**

**This is my story. It’s not always pretty. It’s definitely not always perfect. But it’s real. It’s honest. And it all started with one beat-up, oil-leaking, hundred-decibel dream on two wheels. One thing that I know for sure though is that motorcycles are fucking cool!**

 

**Chapter One: The $500 Shadow**

The first time I got my own bike, it wasn’t some head-turning Indian or a fire-breathing sportbike tearing up the track. It was a weathered 1985 Honda Shadow I scooped up for 500 bucks. To anyone else, it probably looked like a junker—a has-been motorcycle with more miles behind it than ahead. But to me, it might as well have been Excalibur.

A buddy of mine, a Marine stationed out in California, mentioned offhand that his parents had an old motorcycle collecting dust in their garage. I made a call, not really expecting anything to come of it. But to my surprise, his mom was more than happy to let it go—said she’d rather see it out on the road again than just rusting away in a dark corner. I didn't hesitate. I drove an hour and a half, handed her a crumpled wad of cash, and loaded that old Shadow into the back of my truck. I didn’t even wait until I got home to start picturing myself riding it.

Was it perfect? Not even close. The seat was cracked. The paint had faded into some confused shade between red and rust. The chrome was pitted, the tires were dry-rotted, and I swear it smelled like gasoline and regret. But when I looked at that bike, all I saw was potential.

It wasn’t fast. It wasn’t pretty. But it was mine.

And that made all the difference.

I rode that thing everywhere. Around town. Out to the lake. Down winding backroads where the world seemed to fall away. With every twist of the throttle, I felt something I’d never felt behind the wheel of a car: connection. It wasn’t just about speed or style—it was about feeling the road beneath me, hearing the engine sing, and knowing that I was alive. Really alive.

There’s something powerful about that first ride. It’s not just movement—it’s transformation. You’re not being carried. You’re commanding something. The wind against your chest, the sound of the motor pulsing in your ears, the vibration in your hands—it’s all part of the experience. That little Honda Shadow lit a fire in my soul that’s never gone out.

And I didn’t care what anyone else thought.

Some of my friends made fun of it. Called it a “grandpa bike.” Laughed when I showed up, helmet under one arm and oil stains on my jeans. But none of that mattered. I had something they didn’t: freedom. Not the kind that comes with money or status, but the kind you earn when you’re out on two wheels with nothing but open road ahead.

I remember the first time I took it out of town—just a short ride to the lake. I had no gear, barely even a clue. A helmet, a hoodie, maybe some torn-up jeans. No gloves. No boots. But when I cracked the throttle and hit 55 mph, it felt like I was breaking the sound barrier. The wind roared, my heart raced, and I gripped those bars like they were the only thing keeping me on Earth. I was terrified. And I was completely, hopelessly hooked.

But that old Shadow had its quirks. It leaked oil like it was sweating through the stress of still existing. It coughed on cold mornings, sometimes refusing to start altogether. And I had no clue how to fix a damn thing. I’d spend hours watching YouTube, calling friends, guessing, swearing, and praying. I once tried tuning the carbs and ended up flooding the engine so bad the entire garage reeked for a week. But I was learning. Every mistake made me better. Every breakdown taught me something new—not just about the bike, but about myself.

That machine was more than a motorcycle. It was a teacher. It taught me about patience, persistence, and pride in getting your hands dirty. It taught me how to focus when everything’s going wrong. How to keep pushing when nothing’s working. That if you want something bad enough—like that bike to fire up one more time—you dig deep and you don’t quit.

That Shadow became part of my identity. I wasn’t just a guy with a motorcycle—I was a rider. I’d cruise into golden summer evenings with no destination, just a full tank and an open road. I’d pass other bikers and they’d nod. That small gesture—a tiny, silent salute—meant everything. I was in. I was part of something bigger now.

But life has a way of shifting gears when you’re not ready.

Work started to pick up. Bills got heavier. I moved to a new place and watched more and more days go by without riding. The Shadow sat longer and longer, until I had to admit it: she needed to go. I didn’t want to sell her, but life was demanding sacrifices, and I thought maybe it was time to grow up a bit.

The day I handed over the keys, I tried to play it cool. The guy loaded it up, strapped it down, and drove off. I stood in the driveway watching it disappear like I was saying goodbye to a piece of myself. My chest was tight. My hands were cold. I felt hollow.

If you’ve ever sold your first bike, you know exactly what I mean.

I promised myself it wouldn’t be the end. That I’d get another one soon.

But “soon” turned into years.

**Chapter Two: Life Without a Throttle**

The driveway was quiet.

Too quiet.

It’s a strange kind of silence when the bike is gone. Not the kind of quiet that’s peaceful, like the calm before sunrise. No—this was the kind of quiet that felt like something was missing. Like a piece of me had been ripped out and left behind on that concrete. The kind of quiet that echoes.

You don’t really understand how deeply a motorcycle can get under your skin until it’s gone. Sure, it’s just a machine, just metal and rubber and oil. But to me, it was more than that. It was a heartbeat outside my own chest. A source of adrenaline, freedom, identity. And without it, I felt... hollow.

Life kept moving, because it always does. I got up every morning. I went to work. I paid the bills. I smiled when I needed to. But behind that smile, there was a dull ache. A whisper in the back of my mind that kept asking, *Where’s your throttle now?* Every time I saw a bike on the road, something twisted inside me. It was jealousy, yeah—but it was also grief. A deep, quiet mourning for something I’d lost and couldn’t seem to get back.

I told myself I didn’t need it. I could survive without it. But surviving and living? Those are two very different things.

At night, when the world slowed down and the distractions disappeared, I’d scroll through Craigslist looking at bikes I couldn’t afford. Dreaming. Torturing myself. I'd imagine the wind on my face, the hum of the engine beneath me. It was like replaying a favorite song you no longer had the record for. The memory was sweet, but the silence after was deafening.

Then came the downward spiral. A new town. A relationship that seemed like a fresh start but ended up falling apart. Too much booze, too many bad decisions. The partying covered the ache for a while, numbed it just enough. But eventually, it all came crashing down. The hangovers got heavier, and the laughter faded. And when the noise finally stopped, I was alone. Alone with a new kind of silence. Not just the one in my driveway—but the one in my soul.

And in that silence, something stirred.

I remembered what it felt like to ride. To be in control. To be alive. And I knew—I didn’t want that part of me to be gone forever.

But I was broke. Flat broke. I was scraping together gas money, living off cheap food and borrowed time. I didn’t have a backup plan. Just a stubborn streak and a fading dream. But sometimes, that’s all you need.

I reached out to a friend who had a bike sitting in his garage. Another Honda Shadow. Older, worn, forgotten. But when he said he’d be willing to sell it, something lit up inside me. Like a cold engine finally getting a spark. We made a deal, and he agreed to bring it down.

Then came the gut punch—he dropped it while trailering it. Put a big ol’ dent in the tank.

But you know what? I didn’t care. Not even a little. I was just happy it was coming home.

When he pulled into my driveway and I laid eyes on that bike, dent and all, I felt something I hadn’t felt in years: *hope.* I handed over a stack of crumpled bills and signed the title with a hand that was shaking—part nerves, part excitement. I was back. Maybe not officially, but emotionally, spiritually—I was back.

There was just one problem.

No license. No permit. Nothing.

Didn’t stop me.

I fired up that Shadow, and the sound it made? It wasn’t perfect—it was raw, loud, unfiltered. Just like me. It echoed off the buildings, stirred the dust, and punched me right in the chest. It was beautiful.

I studied harder than I’d ever studied before. I failed that damn permit test more times than I want to admit. Drove an hour each way just to walk out disappointed, again and again. And every failure chipped away at me. Not just my confidence, but my self-worth. It started to feel like I’d never get back on the road. Like I was chasing a ghost.

But I didn’t stop.

Then came the day it finally clicked. My buddy loaned me his car, and I drove to Fargo one more time. I walked into that DMV beaten down, but not broken. Sat in front of that screen like it was my final exam in life.

And I passed.

That feeling? Pure, unfiltered joy. I walked out of there like I’d just won a damn championship. Called my buddy and yelled into the phone like a madman. I was floating. I drove back grinning like an idiot, permit in hand, heart racing, and soul on fire.

That evening, I started that bike, pulled out of the driveway, and hit the main road. I don’t remember how fast I went. I don’t remember the traffic or the lights. What I do remember is how it felt. That moment—*that* was freedom. It wasn’t just wind and speed. It was therapy. Healing. A homecoming.

But that dent in the tank? Yeah, it still bugged me. So I got to work.

Walmart. Bondo. Spray paint. A six-pack and some grit. I tore that bike down in my garage like a man possessed. Smoothed out the metal, painted it this weird bluish-purple that I swore looked better under the streetlights. I pieced it all back together like I was rebuilding a part of myself. And when it was done, I stood back, covered in grease and sweat, and I smiled.

It wasn’t a showroom bike. But it was mine. And that was enough.

That Shadow saw late-night rides and early morning commutes. Breakdowns and breakthroughs. It got me through more than just miles. It got me through *life.*

In that little garage, with busted knuckles and oil-stained jeans, I found myself again. Not in a dramatic, movie-worthy way. But in a quiet, honest one. And that, more than anything else, is what motorcycles gave me: not just a way forward, but a way back.

 

**Chapter Three: The Throttle Calls Again**

I thought it was time for a change. I didn’t know what kind of change—I just felt it gnawing at me. Like a soft whisper in the back of my head that got louder every time I ignored it. Life was steady… too steady. Routine had dulled the edge of everything, and I was craving something that could punch through the monotony and wake me the hell up.

Then it showed up—this wild-looking, bug-eyed, alien-green 2003 Triumph Speed 3. My buddy owned it—the same guy who helped me maneuver a motorcycle for the first time back when I was still figuring out which way the throttle turned. He let me sit on it, thumb the starter, feel the pulse of that unruly engine through the frame.

It was raw. It was aggressive. It was everything my life wasn’t at the time.

And despite its strange green paint that reminded me of radioactive snot—I was obsessed. It wasn’t pretty. It wasn’t refined. But it had attitude. It had edge. And deep down, I knew I needed that energy back in my life.

We struck a deal, and suddenly, that beautiful beast was mine.

The Speed 3 needed work. Nothing catastrophic—a clutch cable, a tire, a steady oil drip—but enough to keep me busy. I didn’t mind. Hell, I welcomed it. I’d visit the storage unit where it lived, even when I couldn’t ride. I’d fire it up, listen to that Two Brothers pipe bark through the echo of cold concrete, and just stand there with my hands in my pockets, breathing in the fumes like medicine.

And then came that icy day.

Snow was still crusted around the edges of the storage lot, and the exit path was layered in a sheet of slick, unforgiving ice. But I couldn’t wait anymore. I needed to *feel* it move—just once. I eased onto the bike, feathered the clutch, and tried to sneak it out gently. But as soon as the rear tire touched ice, it whipped out from under me. Bam. Down I went. Bike on top of me. My leg throbbed, my pride stung, and the tank had a fresh chip in the paint.

And you know what? I still grinned. Because that fall meant I was back in the game. I’d missed the risk. The ridiculousness. The unpredictability.

Eventually, the ice gave way to spring, and when the warm wind returned, that Triumph came alive. The first real ride on that machine was unforgettable. I felt like I was gripping lightning. Somewhere on a stretch of back road, I twisted the throttle just a little too hard and—whoops—accidental wheelie. The front wheel floated and time stood still. I was wide-eyed, clenching the bars, half screaming, half laughing inside my helmet. I wasn’t ready for that kind of power—but it didn’t matter.

Still… I knew the truth.

I wasn’t mature enough for that bike. I didn’t have the skill or the self-control to wield it safely, not yet. And if I didn’t let go of it, it might let go of me—at 90 miles per hour and in the worst way possible. So I made the call and sold it.

And then came the Yamaha V Star 650.

Total opposite energy. She was a low-slung cruiser, black with subtle ghost flames licking under the clear coat, like they were hiding just beneath the surface. She had a Mustang solo seat, Vance & Hines pipes, floorboards—the whole “laid-back bad boy” vibe. That bike didn’t scream *speed.* She whispered *style.*

I felt like royalty on that thing.

I had a neighbor with a Street Glide, and we’d ride everywhere together—long, lazy country loops under blue skies and golden sunsets. That V Star became my sanctuary. A moving temple. The place I went to clear my head and find some damn peace. I wasn’t just riding—I was healing. Every mile was like therapy I didn’t have to talk through.

But life—life doesn’t give a damn about your peace.

A new job opportunity popped up, and it meant moving again. New city, new bills, new struggles. I brought the V Star with me, of course. I wasn’t about to let go of her… until money got tight. Really tight.

So I did what I had to do.

I sold her.

I tried to act like it was just another grown-up decision, but truthfully? It felt like another piece of me was getting ripped away. I stood there, watching the new owner ride off into the distance, and felt like I’d betrayed something sacred. I messaged that guy more than once, trying to buy it back, but he loved it too much. I couldn’t blame him.

And that ache—it came back stronger than ever.

I’d be driving around in my pickup, and every time I saw a rider, something in me twitched. Like a muscle memory that refused to die. I could hear the exhausts before I saw the bikes, and it would trigger this raw mix of adrenaline and sorrow. It wasn’t just missing the ride—I missed the part of myself that *only* existed when I was on two wheels.

I tried to shut it down. Tried to forget.

But the dream doesn’t die just because you tell it to.

One day, out of nowhere, a buddy asked if I knew anyone looking for a bike. I said no without thinking, but then he mentioned he had a Honda Shadow sitting in his garage—dusty, neglected, but running.

I felt that old electricity shoot through my chest.

I saw the pictures, heard it run, and just like that—I was shaking. I didn’t even pretend to think about it. I made an offer, struck a deal, and became the owner of a 1997 Honda Shadow ACE. Two-tone red and tan. Chrome for days. It looked like the kind of bike you’d see in a movie and think, *Yeah, that’s a proper cruiser.*

This time, I made myself a promise.

*I will not let this one go.*

And I didn’t. I rode it everywhere. Rain, cold, wind—it didn’t matter. That bike brought me back to life. It wasn’t just about speed or freedom anymore. It was about reclaiming something I thought I’d lost forever.

But just when it all felt right again… the problems started.

She’d run fine for a bit, and then—out of nowhere—stall. Dead. Nothing. It always happened once the engine warmed up. I checked everything I could. Fuel. Spark. Plugs. Wires. It didn’t make sense. And each time it happened, it chipped away at my joy.

Eventually, I took it to a local mechanic. He thought he had it solved—something about coils or the CDI box. I didn’t care. I just wanted to ride without fear of getting stranded.

And I did. For a while.

But one warm afternoon, mid-ride, she died again. Same issue. Same frustration. That feeling of betrayal—of pouring your heart into something, only to get burned—came back full force.

I snapped.

I threw the bike on a trailer, strapped it down, and headed to the shop. But just as I turned onto his street, I heard that sickening sound—*thud.*

The strap had snapped.

My Shadow—*my* bike—had tipped in the trailer and slammed into the rail. I pulled over, heart in my throat, and saw the dent in the tank. It wasn’t just a dent. It was a scar. A fresh wound on something I loved.

I stood there staring at it. Furious. Heartbroken. Helpless.

All I wanted to do was ride.

And yet here I was again—fighting ghosts, chasing a dream that kept slipping through my fingers.

I pulled into the mechanic’s driveway, got out, and stared at the bike for a long time before unloading it. I was quiet. Numb. But somewhere deep inside, something shifted.

Maybe it was time to stop chasing fixes.

Maybe it was time to start chasing something bigger.

Maybe it was time to go after the dream I’d carried since I first learned what it meant to *really* ride.

And this time, I wasn’t asking for permission.

**Chapter Four: The Indian Dream**

I was working the night shift at the time, scrolling through the internet like I’d done a hundred times before—mindlessly drifting from bike to bike. But that night, something felt different. The screen wasn’t just a distraction. It was a mirror. And in that reflection, I saw the truth I’d been ignoring for too long.

I didn’t just *want* another motorcycle.

I *needed* one.

But not just any bike. I needed *the* bike—the one I should’ve chased years ago. The one that had lived in the back of my mind like a quiet heartbeat, waiting for its moment.

I’d never said it out loud because it felt too far away. Too big. Too bold.

But deep down, I’d always known: I wanted an Indian.

Not because of engine specs. Not because of popularity. Not because of some loud marketing campaign.

It was a feeling. A calling.

Some guys are Harley guys. Others swear by Honda or Yamaha. Me? I was an Indian guy. Always had been. I just hadn’t been brave enough—or ready enough—to admit it until now.

A lot of it goes back to *The World’s Fastest Indian*. The first time I saw Burt Munro’s story, something inside me clicked. Here was this scrappy, stubborn Kiwi with an ancient Indian Scout and a dream bigger than his budget. He poured everything he had—his time, his sweat, his soul—into that bike just to chase speed across a desert of salt.

He didn’t do it for fame. He didn’t do it for money. He did it because he *had* to.

And man, did that stick with me.

That movie didn’t just inspire me—it carved itself into my bones. Every scene, every speech, every roar of that Indian engine became part of the way I saw motorcycles—and part of how I saw myself.

The very next day, I picked up the phone and called the nearest Indian dealership.

“I want to buy a Scout Bobber Sixty,” I said. No hesitation. No backup plan. Just certainty, like I’d rehearsed that sentence my whole life.

And for the first time in a long damn time… everything just clicked.

The guy fixing my Shadow? He bought it from me the same day. I loaded up my trailer—this time with a wheel chock, not taking any more chances—and hit the road. Ninety miles of buzzing anticipation, my heart pounding louder with each passing mile.

And then I saw it—that massive red Indian Motorcycle sign, bold against the sky.

Pulling into that lot felt like walking into a dream I never thought I’d touch. My boots hit the pavement, and I walked through the doors with fire in my chest. I wasn’t here to look. I wasn’t here to fantasize. I was here to *become*.

They rolled it out—sleek, black, and mean as hell. The Scout Bobber Sixty.

I swung a leg over it and thumbed the starter.

The engine snarled to life, and in that instant, I wasn’t tired anymore. I wasn’t broke, or broken, or doubting myself.

I was alive.

That V-twin breathed into me like oxygen after drowning. All the bullshit I’d been through—the mechanical failures, the stranded roadsides, the heartbreak of letting go of bikes I loved—it all evaporated in the roar of that engine.

I signed the papers with a grin I couldn’t wipe off if I tried. It wasn’t just a transaction—it was a transformation. A turning point.

The whole drive home, I kept glancing in the rearview mirror just to make sure it was real. That it wasn’t a dream I’d wake up from.

When I pulled into my driveway, I unstrapped the Scout, rolled it off the trailer, and fired it up again. I didn’t even take my boots off—I went straight for a ride.

And *damn*, did I ride.

That first twist of the throttle on home turf felt like baptism. Like redemption. Like stepping into the life I was always meant to live.

Because this wasn’t just another bike.

This was *the* bike.

And I wasn’t just some guy who liked motorcycles anymore.

I was a rider.

Every time I fired that Scout up, I felt it in my chest—that pulse, that rhythm that only another rider knows. That bike didn’t just rumble. It spoke. It reminded me that I wasn’t just living to survive—I was living to *feel*.

I started taking the long way everywhere. Groceries? Long way. Late night shift? Long way. Any excuse to ride, I took it. Not to escape—but to come home to myself.

Some nights, I’d pull off on a quiet country road, kill the engine, and just sit there. Listening to the tick of cooling metal, the rustle of grass in the breeze, the distant chirp of crickets. That silence—the kind only a motorcycle ride can give you—became sacred.

It gave me peace. It gave me clarity. It gave me *purpose*.

People ask me all the time: “Why Indian? Why not Harley?”

I just smile.

They don’t get it. And maybe they never will.

This wasn’t about brand loyalty or being part of a crowd. This was about chasing a feeling I first tasted years ago on a clapped-out Honda Shadow. A feeling I lost, chased down, and finally—*finally*—held in my hands again.

This Indian wasn’t just a motorcycle.

It was proof.

Proof that no matter how many times I got knocked down, I’d always find my way back to two wheels.

Proof that I was never meant to walk through this life—I was meant to *ride* through it.

I leaned into that first real corner back home, feeling the tires bite into the pavement, the wind tugging at my jacket, and I swore to myself:

*I’m never going back.*

I’d been without a throttle too many times. I’d seen the emptiness, the frustration, the aching silence it left behind.

Not again.

This was the start of something new. A chapter I didn’t want to end.

Because now?

Now I was riding for *me*.

And this time?

I wasn’t letting go.

 

**Chapter Five: The One That Changed It All**

I truly believe that motorcycle changed how I feel about motorcycles altogether. Yeah, I’ve always been obsessed—eat, breathe, dream kind of obsessed—but that Scout Bobber Sixty? That one flipped a switch in me I didn’t even know existed.

It wasn’t just another bike. It was *the* bike. The one where everything I’d been chasing since I first wrapped my hands around a throttle finally came together. It was like all the miles, all the breakdowns, all the heartache—it was all leading to *that* machine.

That bike didn’t just take me places. It *took me in*.

Every town I could reach, every back road with no name, every stretch of open highway that dared me to go a little further—I was there. Just me and the Scout. I didn’t need a reason. I didn’t need a plan. Sometimes I’d head out just to feel the wind in my chest and the weight of the world peel off behind me.

It’s hard to explain exactly what changed. Maybe it was finally owning the Indian I’d dreamt about for so long. Maybe it was how the bike fit me—how it felt like it had been waiting for me all along, built for no one else. Or maybe it was that I’d finally come out the other side of all the bullshit—financial struggles, busted bikes, hard goodbyes—and found something that made it all make sense.

Whatever it was, something inside me shifted the day I rode that Scout home. And I haven’t been the same since.

But eventually… I felt it again.

That pull.

Not because I wanted to let go of the Scout—I loved that bike like a part of me—but because I was ready for the next chapter. I’d tasted freedom. Now I wanted more. I wanted to go further, ride longer. I needed something that could carry more than just me—I needed something that could carry *my life*.

So I did what any totally sane, motorcycle-obsessed addict would do: I traded the Scout in and rolled out of the dealership on an Indian Springfield Dark Horse.

And holy hell, what a machine.

Blacked out, mean, and muscular as hell. That bike didn’t whisper freedom—it *roared* it. From the moment I threw a leg over it, I knew I hadn’t just stepped up to a new bike. I’d stepped into the rider I was always meant to be.

This wasn’t a midlife crisis.

This was a *midlife awakening*.

I’ve owned that Springfield for a few years now. We’ve chased sunsets across state lines, stared down thunderstorms, powered through blistering summer heat and the kind of wind that tries to rip you clean off the road. And that bike? It’s never let me down. It doesn’t just carry me—it carries *everything I’ve become*.

Every time I fire it up, I get that same gut-deep feeling I had the first time I twisted a throttle. That thrill. That clarity. That *rightness*.

Lately though, I’ve started to feel the itch again. But this time, it’s different. It’s not about more horsepower or shinier chrome. It’s about *living* more. It’s about waking up to the sound of the wind in the trees, cooking coffee over a camp stove beside the bike, and riding into the unknown with nothing but a map in my head and the road under my wheels.

So I started collecting moto camping gear—tent, tools, cooking kit, the whole works. Not because it’s trendy. Not because I want to post cool pictures.

Because I want to *live* it.

I want to be like those riders I used to stare at as a kid—dusty, sunburned, grinning wide under bug-splattered helmets. The ones who didn’t just ride motorcycles, but *rode into life*.

This isn’t a phase. It’s not a weekend hobby.

It’s a way of life now. A commitment.

A promise to myself that I’ll never go back to feeling empty. That I’ll never let life tame me. That I’ll always chase that feeling—the one I found the first time I cracked open a throttle and felt the world open up.

I don’t know exactly where I’m headed next. But I know this:

I’ll get there on two wheels.

 

**Chapter Six: Throttle Wide Open**

If there’s one thing motorcycles have taught me—beyond the thrill, the freedom, and that deep soul-reset they bring—it’s this:

You can chase down any dream if you’re willing to twist the throttle and hold on.

This journey wasn’t just about machines. It wasn’t about chrome or horsepower or how loud the pipes were. It was about something much deeper—something personal. It was about digging myself out of every setback, every heartbreak, every broken-down mile of life, and finding *me* again. On two wheels. With the wind at my back and nothing ahead but possibility.

There were so many nights where I wasn’t sure I’d ever get here. Nights I laid awake staring at the ceiling, feeling like I’d never afford another bike. Nights when I saw people riding past and it felt like watching a world I was no longer a part of—like the gates to that life had closed on me. Nights I beat myself up for selling bikes I loved, for letting go when I didn’t want to, for thinking maybe the dream wasn’t meant for me after all.

But something inside me never let go. Even when I wasn’t riding, I was still a rider. That identity, that fire, it never died. It just went quiet for a while. Waiting.

And when I finally got back on a bike—*really* got back, with that Indian Scout Bobber Sixty—it was like flipping a switch and waking up a version of myself that had been asleep for far too long. That first ride wasn’t just exciting—it was emotional. It was like finally hearing your own voice again after years of silence. Like finding the missing piece of yourself that you thought was lost forever.

I used to think motorcycles were just machines. Beautiful machines, yes—but still just steel and gas and rubber. But now I know better.

They’re time machines. They’re therapists. They’re soul-reclaimers.

That Scout taught me what it meant to truly *connect* with a bike. It wasn’t just about the ride anymore—it was about everything I’d gone through to get there. Every twist of the throttle felt like a victory. Every mile felt like I was writing a new chapter of my life in real time, leaving the past behind and burning forward into something brand new.

This whole thing… it’s not a hobby anymore.

It’s not even just a passion.

It’s a *way of life*.

It’s a promise I made to myself the moment I threw a leg over that first beat-up $500 Shadow: **no matter what happens, never stop riding**. Never stop chasing what sets your soul on fire. Never let go of the throttle.

Because dreams don’t show up with a ribbon and a full tank. You have to grind for them. Fail for them. Hustle, scrap, and sometimes bleed for them.

But if you hold on long enough, twist hard enough, and believe just a little deeper than the rest?

You’ll get there.

I did.

Today, I’m riding that Springfield. I’ve got a garage that smells like fuel and rubber and freedom. I’ve got gear stacked and ready. And I’ve got a heart full of miles still waiting to be ridden.

 

So if you’re reading this, and you’re wondering if it’s too late for you…

If you’re standing on the edge of your dream, unsure whether to leap…

I’m here to tell you: *Do it.*

Twist that throttle and go.

Because the road doesn’t care who you used to be—it only cares that you show up.

**This story is dedicated to the people and the adventures I made along the way—each one of you helped shape the rider I’ve become.**

**And to WDH—Rest in Peace.**  
*Thank you for helping me pave the road. Your incredible knowledge and adventure helped us learn a lot together. I love you brother.*

 *I’ll carry you with me on every ride.*

Keep two wheels down folks.

I genuinely need further advice on this. I am in this situation with this guy and I am overthinking it. It’s someone I’ve known for quite a long time because I was friends with his sister and he is best friends with my cousin, but we’ve had no reason to interact before due to a 4 year age gap we have. Now I am 25 and he is 29. We saw each other after a long time almost two weeks ago and it was different. People around me have been jokingly saying that I should pursue a guy like him because he is perfect for me and what not. At first I found it quite annoying because it felt too forceful. But then we ended up hanging around each other at this get -together and I was legitimately taken aback by the pull I felt. We locked gazes a few times that night, but I tried not to dwell on that. Then two days later, I saw him again at the pharmacy he works at and I was surprised that he actually initiated a conversation. Following that, I decided to add him as a friend on Facebook and sent him a message related to job seeking. I actually thought he would leave it at that but then he started asking me questions and now we’ve been talking non stop for the past week or so . Replies are a bit slow because he is incredibly busy, but I would say it’s going well. There is a connection there, and our convos flow quite naturally. We tease each other a bit, we share interests, we have a couple of inside jokes, and maybe it’s an exaggeration but we are now onto hearting each other’s messages. I did see him a third time the other day and it was slightly more awkward face to face but that might have been due to his father and my grandpa being there. He is quite reserved and introverted so I am genuinely not sure if he is just pursuing a friendship here or something more. My cousin’s fiancée has also been trying to set us up for a while. I suffer from anxiety so I tend to get too in my head about things and overthink everything. Most people are suggesting I ask him out for a simple coffee, but I don't know if I should.

I woke up to the soft glow of morning light filtering through the curtains, casting a warm hue across the room. For a moment, everything felt quiet and still—until I remembered.

We’re married now.

The thought brought a small smile to my face as I turned to see you still asleep beside me, your breathing steady and peaceful. It was a simple moment, but it felt significant. The start of something new.

Not wanting to wake you just yet, I carefully slipped out of bed and made my way to the kitchen. Maybe I could surprise you with breakfast—though whether it would turn out edible was another story.

Still, as I stood there, staring at the coffee maker like it held the secrets to marriage itself, I couldn’t help but feel a quiet kind of happiness.


Hi everyone, I am looking to rp as two newlyweds. I would like to include a set of dice or random number generator with random events to make the plot more fun. This would create a set of fun plotlines that really invigorate the story. 

First grocery trip together – They realize they have very different shopping habits and debate over which brand of peanut butter is superior.

Cooking disaster – One of them tries to cook a romantic meal but forgets a key ingredient or burns something.

Lazy rainy day – They stay in pajamas all day, build a blanket fort, and watch old movies.

First big purchase – They go furniture shopping and struggle to agree on a couch or dining table.

Surprise date night – One plans a surprise date, but it doesn't go exactly as intended (maybe they get lost or the restaurant loses their reservation).

Lost wedding ring scare – One panics after misplacing their wedding ring, only to find it in a silly place.

Pet adoption – They consider adopting a pet and visit a shelter, debating over a dog, cat, or something else.

DIY home project gone wrong – They try to assemble furniture or paint a room together, but it turns into chaos.

Meeting the in-laws – A family member makes an unexpected visit, leading to some awkward or funny moments. Here are some ideas for that to add to it.

Game night rivalry – They have a friendly but competitive board game or video game night, and things get hilariously intense.

Morning routine differences – One is an early riser, the other loves to sleep in, leading to amusing compromises.

Holiday decorating – They have different opinions on how to decorate for the holidays, leading to a fun mini-feud.

Surprise gift exchange – They both try to find the perfect small gift for each other and end up with funny or touching results.

Midnight snack runs – They sneak out late at night in pajamas to grab ice cream or fast food.

Anniversary plans gone awry – Their first-month or first-year celebration doesn't go as expected but turns into a great memory anyway.",1,1744061521.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn’t appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I’m liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn’t want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I’m looking forward to taking about what you didn’t like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I’ll hit u up for next time. I’m looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don’t feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction. 

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens. 

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character. Non stop.

I’m not interested in ever being friends after this. I don’t deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama). When he sees me in passing he just nods my head or actually gives me a pound with his fist and says ""hey what's up Adam"". AITA ?

Also, if he ever comes up to me to try to ""talk"", what should I do/say? Ive completely ceased contact with the entire group. ",3,1744061392.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Lately she has been reaching her paw out at us humans when we walk by her (no claws) and we see that as a sign to pet her. She loves it(?), she'll raise her butt in the air, rub her face/head on anything she can while we scratch her back. Her ears are up, her eyes are open, her tail isn't twitchy, but it does sway back and forth, and when we stop petting her, she'll get a little more aggressive by reaching her paw out at us again, maybe with slightly extended claws (never an aggressive scratch), so we may choose to pet her again. Every time we stop petting her, she gets more and more sassy with reaching out over and over, bonking her head on us and has even spit at me when I stopped petting her. Also, she never leaves when we stop, she follows us and even jumps across to the next area to tag us again. (I figured if she's overstimulated then she would choose to leave the area).

 There have been separate instances when she gives a little nibble while you're petting her to tell you to stop because she's overstimulated, but this seems so much different than that. I have not been able to read whether she likes it and wants us to continue or wants us to stop. The reaching out is new to me, and it seems like it's to get our attention. Does anyone have a cat that acts like this too?

 Side Question:  She rubs her face/head all over my coffee cup (full or empty) …really hard. Is that because she hates the smell and trying to cover it? Or does she love it and wants to be closer to it? I think it's cute but maybe it's really bothering her?",1,1744061353.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False
1jtwvl4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jtwvl4,New Platform Updates,"Platform Updates – Lessons Learned and What I Changed

After running my platform build for about a year, I realized there were a few things that just weren’t working the way I wanted. So over the winter, I took it apart and rebuilt it with a few key goals in mind:
	•	Lower the overall height for better headroom
	•	Make it way easier to pull out and reinstall
	•	Regain access to the third seat while the platform is still in use
	•	Make fine-tuning and leveling adjustments easier on the fly

The original design was mostly based on Nick Carver’s setup from YouTube. It worked pretty well at first, but after some real use, a few issues started standing out:
	•	The 3/4” piping was a pain to deal with—I didn’t have the right tools to easily cut or adjust it
	•	The platform design completely blocked the third seat
	•	Taking the platform in and out took more time and effort than I wanted

I also spent some time looking into Knee Payne’s build. His approach is more complex, but it’s packed with smart ideas—especially around modularity and third-seat integration. A lot of the same principles apply, and it gave me a solid reference point.

I’ve recently switched over to a new adjustable leg system (screenshot at the end). So far, I’m really liking it—it makes leveling easier, especially if I’m parked on uneven ground, and I don’t have to mess with cutting pipe every time I want to make a small change.

Still a couple things to figure out:
	•	Bigger adjustments take forever—those fine threads are really fine
	•	The front legs now rest on the back of the folded-down seat, which isn’t ideal long-term. It’s a bit hard on the leather, so I’ll probably come up with an alternative for that contact point

⸻

Keyway Upgrade – Big Win

One of the best additions I made this round was adding a keyway between the front and rear sections of the platform. I can now slide in a piece of wood that acts like a structural stud—it supports the front section and locks the two halves together.

That small detail made a huge difference. The whole platform feels way more solid now, like one single piece instead of two loosely connected parts.

⸻

Side Notes

I haven’t fully figured out how I want to link in the third platform section yet. But since it’s usually just me it hasn’t really been a priority. Still, it’s something I’d like to dial in down the road.

⸻

Let me know if anyone has questions or wants more detail—happy to share what worked (and what didn’t). Still a work in progress, but this version feels way closer to what I actually need.",10,1744061328.0,4Runner,2,1.0,False
1jtwv56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catan/comments/1jtwv56/the_absolute_worst_6th_edition_changes/,The absolute WORST 6th Edition changes,"While the 6th Edition has been a massive improvement, they made some really bizarre decisions. Here is all the really bad changes in one spot.

1. **Base Game**: The backs of the Resource Cards were changed for the first time ever. Now this can't be combined with an older edition C&K >:(. On a related note, the back of the Dev Cards being a similar colour as the Brick cards is a Bad Idea.
2. **Base Game**: The removal of Harbor Tokens
3. **Base Game**: For Variable Setup, the option to go full random with the #s was omitted. And along with that, the *very important rule* that Red #s (6 & 8) should **never** be adjacent was also omitted. This is an utter travesty.
4. **Seafarers**: You couldn't simply keep the build cost for Ships on the ends of the frame? Did you *really* need to make a tiny extension for each Player Aid?
5. **Seafarers**: For 'The Fog Islands', the Variable Setup says its okay to have adjacent Red #s. This is outright *outrageous*. Did someone forget their coffee when writing this? (I have worse accusations to say but they are all mean). Mind boggling, I hope this is a mistake.
6. **Seafarers**: Why was New World relabeled from the 9th Scenario, to a Variant? Makes no sense.
7. **Cities & Knights**: Like in the Base Game, the backs of Commodity Cards also changed. So this can't be used with older editions of the Base Game.
8. **Cities & Knights**: They dropped the three Variants that used to be mentioned at the end. Did they run out of pages or something???
9. **Traders & Barbarians**: Harbormaster used to refer to the name of the Variant *and* the Special VP Card. Now the Variant is called Harbors of Catan, and the card is Strongest Ports. Both names are ""fine"", but can't you just stick to *one* name, guys?. Name it after the VP Card, that is what everyone will call it anyways. A better name would be Port Master. Simple.
10. **Traders & Barbarians**: They removed the Red Die icon from the Catan Event Cards. C'mon Catan Studio, *really*? You didn't have to copy Germany on this one. They should have copied *you!* What's the point combining with C&K if you are only removing the Yellow die?
11. **Traders & Barbarians**: *They replaced the Bronze Camels with ugly grey carts*. Welp, there goes all the flavor from this scenario. The Camels were fun! And now I'm starting to realize I am getting sick of all the 'neutral' pieces being coloured Grey.
12. **Traders & Barbarians**: The Oasis Hex is now a boring Watering Hole hex. This is because they changed the whole theme of the scenario. The idea of Desert Nomads needing food and clothing has been lost. You used to attract their Camel Caravans with Wheat and Wool. Now the new theme of the scenario is ""we must establish trade route"" *Boring*. And the reason why you vote with Wheat and Wool is lost.
13. **Explorers & Pirates**: The Green Moon and Orange Sun symbols on the backs of hexes and # Token were replaced with Parrots and Geese. Why??? The green and orange symbols were distinct and easy to spot. Now the artworks on both are flocks of tiny birds. Hard to tell apart at first glance, in spite of the different coloured birds. *Especially* in the rulebook. And *Geese*? Wouldn't *Sea Gulls* make more thematic sense?
14. **Explorers & Pirates**: A teeny tiny, *singular* Trade Rate Tile? Guys, there is enough empty room on the E&P Player Aids to include this information on them! Or perhaps on the back! But no, there is only **one** tiny piece (not one per player, just ONE) that is placed beside the board. Sure, the players on the far ends of the board would be able to read that, *surely* (/sarcasm). If you don't want to edit the Player Aids, then print the info on the Frame end pieces (the ones with pre-printed Sea and Pasture hexes).

Throughout my life, I’ve expressed myself through my mind and intellect and these have always been the parts of me I took pride in. The intuition I’ve carried since childhood, on the other hand, I’ve mostly pushed to the background, using it in moments like reading coffee cups (I’m from Turkey, where things like this are deeply embedded in our culture). But recently, a rapid shift began in my life, and now I find myself in an intensely intuitive state like never before.

I believe all of us are witnessing and feeling a change. However, I don’t agree with some of the perspectives I’ve come across here (such as ignoring what’s happening in the world and focusing solely on the inner world). Perhaps it’s because I’ve never been fully at peace with my spiritual side and haven’t spent much time developing it.

I’m not sure if it’s important, but I feel an urge to write. 

My intuition tells me this: Evil exists. Evil is mechanical and assertive. It is two-dimensional and above, and it observes very well. It understands emotions, knows needs precisely. This is present in old leadership models. It’s not easy to defeat, and likewise, we cannot be free individually. We need to make all of us free.

Good also exists and in abundance. Good is organic. But its visibility is restricted, preventing its actions from becoming collective (and from awakening to its own power). Unlike evil, which recognizes emotions, good is heart itself. In order to be liberated, it must look at evil, must examine it rationally. It must not avoid looking, and it must not be swept away by emotion while doing so. To look at evil without becoming it, shadow work is needed—for if you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss also gazes into you. He who fights monsters for too long may become one himself.

My intuition tells me human history is full of such attempts. But no attempt at liberation carried out through the methods of evil can ever succeed. We need to access the organic intelligence of good. I believe this is what we are all beginning to do here. This is my intuition.

With love.

*spoiler alert*
I finished watching White Lotus last night and there was an episode that really resonated with me in terms of what happened during my adulterous adventure. In summary, I attempted an affair a few months back where my AP only wanted money from me. 

For those who are following White Lotus S3E7, a character named Laurie decides to have an ONS with Aleksei. The two started sharing more intimate things with each other during the afterglow of sex, Aleksei tells Laurie about his financial struggles and begs Laurie to help his situation so he can fly his mother in from Russia. Fortunately, Laurie was able to run away when Aleksei's gf shows up unexpectedly at the apartment. 

How this feels like deja vu to me is when my AP asked me for money. I met my AP after she replied to my ad on Reddit. We probably should not have started sexting so soon before we met for coffee in retrospect but I think that was her hook. My AP proceeded to tell me things about her family and about her financial struggles. This started to feel very transactional to me so I stopped all discussions and deleted her contact.

1jtwroy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jtwroy/in_a_really_weird_spot_and_need_someone_advice/,In a really weird spot and need someone advice,"Hi everyone, so my gf (26F) and I (26M) have been broken up for about 5 weeks now. 4 weeks of that we have been no contact. The reason why we broke up is I started having life altering health issues. This flipped my whole life on its head. I no longer could/can go to the gym and lift, rock climb, drink alcohol, or even coffee, and I am in fairly constant pain. Basically all of my outlets were ripped away from me in a blink of an eye. As a result, this led me to be anxious, insecure, and ultimately a shell of the person I once was. I was holding myself up strong… but after coming home from a vacation to the harsh reality of my life… i broke. Upon doing so I leaned on my girlfriend a little too hard for a few days. I was lovebombing, oversharing, and seeking validation that WE were okay because it made ME feel okay. After about 3 days of this, she brought to my attention what I was doing. That I was smothering her. I have been on the flip side of this in past relationships and know how it felt and immediately changed my actions. It however was too late. 

These anxiously attached actions (even though in normal health I am secure) triggered her avoidant attachment. She slowly began drifting away from me over the course of a month. There were ups and downs, but ultimately she “fell out of love” with me. We “mutually” broke up after about a month of weird distance from her. But really she broke up with me. I chased after this… clinging onto the only part of my normal life I felt I had left. I did this for about a week but she assured me this was the end and we are breaking up. When we initially broke up she said “some ex’s get back together”. But after chasing for that week she said “i have no intentions of getting back together”. 

We had a music festival planned for June and the wristbands are arriving at my house. I told her “lets stay no contact until those wristbands arrive”. This would be about 2.5 months after the breakup. 2.5 months of NC. Me trying to gain some control back. 

I find myself still having hope for some reason. I gave this girl the world and was an amazing boyfriend. I havent always been to others in the past but this time I was ready for love and proved it every time. She said nobody has ever made her feel loved and accepted and appreciated the way I made her feel. When these wristbands come, i have this fantasy in my head that we will reconnect and work all this out. The only thing is that its still a month and a half away. I feel like I cant keep holding onto this hope for another month and a half as she is all I can think about night and day. Its getting in the way of my job, my mental health, and my healing journey physically. Im immensely depressed. For that reason, I feel like I need to reach out. Asking her if this is really what she wants and see if she has any remorse. Breaking No Contact so I can hopefully heal fully whether she accepts or denies me. If she says no, then I can delete her number, burn the love letters, delete the pictures of us in my phone and finally move on. I keep going back to these in moments of weakness. 

Would it be weak to break NC for this? Should I tough it out and wait another month and a half and see what happens then? I fear i may wait all that time and she will deny me then, setting me back when I could have just reached out now and started healing fully so much earlier. I dont care for mind games, whos right and whos wrong, I just want my sanity back. 

What do we think? I know this was long but I could really use some advice. ",1,1744061048.0,Advice,8,1.0,False
1jtwroj,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1jtwroj/im_you_enjoy_reading_motorcycles_storied_heres/,Im you enjoy reading motorcycles storied heres mine and take about 45 minutes :),"**Title:** **Two Wheels to Freedom**

**You probably have no idea who I am, so let me start with a little intro. I live in North Dakota, I’m 30 years old, and I’m a passionate motorcycle rider—yeah, I know, how cliché. But here's the twist: I don’t come from a motorcycle family. My parents didn’t ride. My brother didn’t ride. No uncles, cousins, or long-lost great-grandpas ever passed down the love of two wheels. Nothing. It’s weird.**

**Most riders I meet have those classic origin stories—“My dad raced flat track,” or “My mom was part of a club back in the day.” They talk about being kids in garages, sneaking peeks while someone wrenched on a bike, or getting their first mini dirt bike before they could walk straight. Not me. I didn’t have a legacy. No worn-out leather jacket passed down. No Harley memorabilia in the garage. No dusty tool chest filled with half-used parts and old patches. Just silence. I had to find this path on my own. And maybe, in a strange way, that’s what makes it all mean even more to me.**

**I first fell in love with motorcycles as a kid—not by riding them, but by seeing them. My family didn’t fly places; we drove. Minnesota, the Black Hills, Mount Rushmore—anywhere within range that didn’t break the bank. Long, cramped car rides through the Midwest with me and my brother in the backseat, bickering or zoning out while the radio played dad’s music. And every once in a while, we’d pass them—bikers.**

**I remember watching them roll by in packs. Leather jackets, sissy bars, saddlebags stuffed with tents, cots, and God knows what else. I’d press my face against the window just to get a better look. There was something about the way they looked—sunburnt faces under helmets, bugs stuck to their windshields, road grime on their jeans—and yet they always looked so…free. They didn’t seem like people running from something. They looked like people who knew exactly where they were going. Like they had freedom in their back pockets. I couldn’t take my eyes off them.**

**Back then, I didn’t really understand what I was seeing. I was too young to process it. But it left a mark. Somewhere deep down, that image stayed with me. And years later, when I finally had a little freedom of my own—when the bills were paid, and life slowed down just enough—that memory came rushing back.**

**I started noticing bikes again. On the road. In parking lots. I’d hear the sound of a V-twin ripping through the quiet of a Sunday afternoon, and my heart would race. I’d see someone in a worn denim vest with road dirt on their boots, and I’d feel something in my gut twist—not jealousy exactly, but longing. A need.**

**It didn’t happen all at once. There wasn’t one magical day where I woke up and became a rider. It built up over time, slowly stacking inside of me until it overflowed. Until I couldn’t ignore it anymore.**

**Motorcycles, man. I don’t know why they matter so much to me. Maybe because I found them on my own. Maybe because they remind me that freedom isn’t something you’re handed—it’s something you chase. Something you fight for. And sometimes, something you build with your own two hands.**

**This is my story. It’s not always pretty. It’s definitely not always perfect. But it’s real. It’s honest. And it all started with one beat-up, oil-leaking, hundred-decibel dream on two wheels. One thing that I know for sure though is that motorcycles are fucking cool!**

 

**Chapter One: The $500 Shadow**

The first time I got my own bike, it wasn’t some head-turning Indian or a fire-breathing sportbike tearing up the track. It was a weathered 1985 Honda Shadow I scooped up for 500 bucks. To anyone else, it probably looked like a junker—a has-been motorcycle with more miles behind it than ahead. But to me, it might as well have been Excalibur.

A buddy of mine, a Marine stationed out in California, mentioned offhand that his parents had an old motorcycle collecting dust in their garage. I made a call, not really expecting anything to come of it. But to my surprise, his mom was more than happy to let it go—said she’d rather see it out on the road again than just rusting away in a dark corner. I didn't hesitate. I drove an hour and a half, handed her a crumpled wad of cash, and loaded that old Shadow into the back of my truck. I didn’t even wait until I got home to start picturing myself riding it.

Was it perfect? Not even close. The seat was cracked. The paint had faded into some confused shade between red and rust. The chrome was pitted, the tires were dry-rotted, and I swear it smelled like gasoline and regret. But when I looked at that bike, all I saw was potential.

It wasn’t fast. It wasn’t pretty. But it was mine.

And that made all the difference.

I rode that thing everywhere. Around town. Out to the lake. Down winding backroads where the world seemed to fall away. With every twist of the throttle, I felt something I’d never felt behind the wheel of a car: connection. It wasn’t just about speed or style—it was about feeling the road beneath me, hearing the engine sing, and knowing that I was alive. Really alive.

There’s something powerful about that first ride. It’s not just movement—it’s transformation. You’re not being carried. You’re commanding something. The wind against your chest, the sound of the motor pulsing in your ears, the vibration in your hands—it’s all part of the experience. That little Honda Shadow lit a fire in my soul that’s never gone out.

And I didn’t care what anyone else thought.

Some of my friends made fun of it. Called it a “grandpa bike.” Laughed when I showed up, helmet under one arm and oil stains on my jeans. But none of that mattered. I had something they didn’t: freedom. Not the kind that comes with money or status, but the kind you earn when you’re out on two wheels with nothing but open road ahead.

I remember the first time I took it out of town—just a short ride to the lake. I had no gear, barely even a clue. A helmet, a hoodie, maybe some torn-up jeans. No gloves. No boots. But when I cracked the throttle and hit 55 mph, it felt like I was breaking the sound barrier. The wind roared, my heart raced, and I gripped those bars like they were the only thing keeping me on Earth. I was terrified. And I was completely, hopelessly hooked.

But that old Shadow had its quirks. It leaked oil like it was sweating through the stress of still existing. It coughed on cold mornings, sometimes refusing to start altogether. And I had no clue how to fix a damn thing. I’d spend hours watching YouTube, calling friends, guessing, swearing, and praying. I once tried tuning the carbs and ended up flooding the engine so bad the entire garage reeked for a week. But I was learning. Every mistake made me better. Every breakdown taught me something new—not just about the bike, but about myself.

That machine was more than a motorcycle. It was a teacher. It taught me about patience, persistence, and pride in getting your hands dirty. It taught me how to focus when everything’s going wrong. How to keep pushing when nothing’s working. That if you want something bad enough—like that bike to fire up one more time—you dig deep and you don’t quit.

That Shadow became part of my identity. I wasn’t just a guy with a motorcycle—I was a rider. I’d cruise into golden summer evenings with no destination, just a full tank and an open road. I’d pass other bikers and they’d nod. That small gesture—a tiny, silent salute—meant everything. I was in. I was part of something bigger now.

But life has a way of shifting gears when you’re not ready.

Work started to pick up. Bills got heavier. I moved to a new place and watched more and more days go by without riding. The Shadow sat longer and longer, until I had to admit it: she needed to go. I didn’t want to sell her, but life was demanding sacrifices, and I thought maybe it was time to grow up a bit.

The day I handed over the keys, I tried to play it cool. The guy loaded it up, strapped it down, and drove off. I stood in the driveway watching it disappear like I was saying goodbye to a piece of myself. My chest was tight. My hands were cold. I felt hollow.

If you’ve ever sold your first bike, you know exactly what I mean.

I promised myself it wouldn’t be the end. That I’d get another one soon.

But “soon” turned into years.

**Chapter Two: Life Without a Throttle**

The driveway was quiet.

Too quiet.

It’s a strange kind of silence when the bike is gone. Not the kind of quiet that’s peaceful, like the calm before sunrise. No—this was the kind of quiet that felt like something was missing. Like a piece of me had been ripped out and left behind on that concrete. The kind of quiet that echoes.

You don’t really understand how deeply a motorcycle can get under your skin until it’s gone. Sure, it’s just a machine, just metal and rubber and oil. But to me, it was more than that. It was a heartbeat outside my own chest. A source of adrenaline, freedom, identity. And without it, I felt... hollow.

Life kept moving, because it always does. I got up every morning. I went to work. I paid the bills. I smiled when I needed to. But behind that smile, there was a dull ache. A whisper in the back of my mind that kept asking, *Where’s your throttle now?* Every time I saw a bike on the road, something twisted inside me. It was jealousy, yeah—but it was also grief. A deep, quiet mourning for something I’d lost and couldn’t seem to get back.

I told myself I didn’t need it. I could survive without it. But surviving and living? Those are two very different things.

At night, when the world slowed down and the distractions disappeared, I’d scroll through Craigslist looking at bikes I couldn’t afford. Dreaming. Torturing myself. I'd imagine the wind on my face, the hum of the engine beneath me. It was like replaying a favorite song you no longer had the record for. The memory was sweet, but the silence after was deafening.

Then came the downward spiral. A new town. A relationship that seemed like a fresh start but ended up falling apart. Too much booze, too many bad decisions. The partying covered the ache for a while, numbed it just enough. But eventually, it all came crashing down. The hangovers got heavier, and the laughter faded. And when the noise finally stopped, I was alone. Alone with a new kind of silence. Not just the one in my driveway—but the one in my soul.

And in that silence, something stirred.

I remembered what it felt like to ride. To be in control. To be alive. And I knew—I didn’t want that part of me to be gone forever.

But I was broke. Flat broke. I was scraping together gas money, living off cheap food and borrowed time. I didn’t have a backup plan. Just a stubborn streak and a fading dream. But sometimes, that’s all you need.

I reached out to a friend who had a bike sitting in his garage. Another Honda Shadow. Older, worn, forgotten. But when he said he’d be willing to sell it, something lit up inside me. Like a cold engine finally getting a spark. We made a deal, and he agreed to bring it down.

Then came the gut punch—he dropped it while trailering it. Put a big ol’ dent in the tank.

But you know what? I didn’t care. Not even a little. I was just happy it was coming home.

When he pulled into my driveway and I laid eyes on that bike, dent and all, I felt something I hadn’t felt in years: *hope.* I handed over a stack of crumpled bills and signed the title with a hand that was shaking—part nerves, part excitement. I was back. Maybe not officially, but emotionally, spiritually—I was back.

There was just one problem.

No license. No permit. Nothing.

Didn’t stop me.

I fired up that Shadow, and the sound it made? It wasn’t perfect—it was raw, loud, unfiltered. Just like me. It echoed off the buildings, stirred the dust, and punched me right in the chest. It was beautiful.

I studied harder than I’d ever studied before. I failed that damn permit test more times than I want to admit. Drove an hour each way just to walk out disappointed, again and again. And every failure chipped away at me. Not just my confidence, but my self-worth. It started to feel like I’d never get back on the road. Like I was chasing a ghost.

But I didn’t stop.

Then came the day it finally clicked. My buddy loaned me his car, and I drove to Fargo one more time. I walked into that DMV beaten down, but not broken. Sat in front of that screen like it was my final exam in life.

And I passed.

That feeling? Pure, unfiltered joy. I walked out of there like I’d just won a damn championship. Called my buddy and yelled into the phone like a madman. I was floating. I drove back grinning like an idiot, permit in hand, heart racing, and soul on fire.

That evening, I started that bike, pulled out of the driveway, and hit the main road. I don’t remember how fast I went. I don’t remember the traffic or the lights. What I do remember is how it felt. That moment—*that* was freedom. It wasn’t just wind and speed. It was therapy. Healing. A homecoming.

But that dent in the tank? Yeah, it still bugged me. So I got to work.

Walmart. Bondo. Spray paint. A six-pack and some grit. I tore that bike down in my garage like a man possessed. Smoothed out the metal, painted it this weird bluish-purple that I swore looked better under the streetlights. I pieced it all back together like I was rebuilding a part of myself. And when it was done, I stood back, covered in grease and sweat, and I smiled.

It wasn’t a showroom bike. But it was mine. And that was enough.

That Shadow saw late-night rides and early morning commutes. Breakdowns and breakthroughs. It got me through more than just miles. It got me through *life.*

In that little garage, with busted knuckles and oil-stained jeans, I found myself again. Not in a dramatic, movie-worthy way. But in a quiet, honest one. And that, more than anything else, is what motorcycles gave me: not just a way forward, but a way back.

 

**Chapter Three: The Throttle Calls Again**

I thought it was time for a change. I didn’t know what kind of change—I just felt it gnawing at me. Like a soft whisper in the back of my head that got louder every time I ignored it. Life was steady… too steady. Routine had dulled the edge of everything, and I was craving something that could punch through the monotony and wake me the hell up.

Then it showed up—this wild-looking, bug-eyed, alien-green 2003 Triumph Speed 3. My buddy owned it—the same guy who helped me maneuver a motorcycle for the first time back when I was still figuring out which way the throttle turned. He let me sit on it, thumb the starter, feel the pulse of that unruly engine through the frame.

It was raw. It was aggressive. It was everything my life wasn’t at the time.

And despite its strange green paint that reminded me of radioactive snot—I was obsessed. It wasn’t pretty. It wasn’t refined. But it had attitude. It had edge. And deep down, I knew I needed that energy back in my life.

We struck a deal, and suddenly, that beautiful beast was mine.

The Speed 3 needed work. Nothing catastrophic—a clutch cable, a tire, a steady oil drip—but enough to keep me busy. I didn’t mind. Hell, I welcomed it. I’d visit the storage unit where it lived, even when I couldn’t ride. I’d fire it up, listen to that Two Brothers pipe bark through the echo of cold concrete, and just stand there with my hands in my pockets, breathing in the fumes like medicine.

And then came that icy day.

Snow was still crusted around the edges of the storage lot, and the exit path was layered in a sheet of slick, unforgiving ice. But I couldn’t wait anymore. I needed to *feel* it move—just once. I eased onto the bike, feathered the clutch, and tried to sneak it out gently. But as soon as the rear tire touched ice, it whipped out from under me. Bam. Down I went. Bike on top of me. My leg throbbed, my pride stung, and the tank had a fresh chip in the paint.

And you know what? I still grinned. Because that fall meant I was back in the game. I’d missed the risk. The ridiculousness. The unpredictability.

Eventually, the ice gave way to spring, and when the warm wind returned, that Triumph came alive. The first real ride on that machine was unforgettable. I felt like I was gripping lightning. Somewhere on a stretch of back road, I twisted the throttle just a little too hard and—whoops—accidental wheelie. The front wheel floated and time stood still. I was wide-eyed, clenching the bars, half screaming, half laughing inside my helmet. I wasn’t ready for that kind of power—but it didn’t matter.

Still… I knew the truth.

I wasn’t mature enough for that bike. I didn’t have the skill or the self-control to wield it safely, not yet. And if I didn’t let go of it, it might let go of me—at 90 miles per hour and in the worst way possible. So I made the call and sold it.

And then came the Yamaha V Star 650.

Total opposite energy. She was a low-slung cruiser, black with subtle ghost flames licking under the clear coat, like they were hiding just beneath the surface. She had a Mustang solo seat, Vance & Hines pipes, floorboards—the whole “laid-back bad boy” vibe. That bike didn’t scream *speed.* She whispered *style.*

I felt like royalty on that thing.

I had a neighbor with a Street Glide, and we’d ride everywhere together—long, lazy country loops under blue skies and golden sunsets. That V Star became my sanctuary. A moving temple. The place I went to clear my head and find some damn peace. I wasn’t just riding—I was healing. Every mile was like therapy I didn’t have to talk through.

But life—life doesn’t give a damn about your peace.

A new job opportunity popped up, and it meant moving again. New city, new bills, new struggles. I brought the V Star with me, of course. I wasn’t about to let go of her… until money got tight. Really tight.

So I did what I had to do.

I sold her.

I tried to act like it was just another grown-up decision, but truthfully? It felt like another piece of me was getting ripped away. I stood there, watching the new owner ride off into the distance, and felt like I’d betrayed something sacred. I messaged that guy more than once, trying to buy it back, but he loved it too much. I couldn’t blame him.

And that ache—it came back stronger than ever.

I’d be driving around in my pickup, and every time I saw a rider, something in me twitched. Like a muscle memory that refused to die. I could hear the exhausts before I saw the bikes, and it would trigger this raw mix of adrenaline and sorrow. It wasn’t just missing the ride—I missed the part of myself that *only* existed when I was on two wheels.

I tried to shut it down. Tried to forget.

But the dream doesn’t die just because you tell it to.

One day, out of nowhere, a buddy asked if I knew anyone looking for a bike. I said no without thinking, but then he mentioned he had a Honda Shadow sitting in his garage—dusty, neglected, but running.

I felt that old electricity shoot through my chest.

I saw the pictures, heard it run, and just like that—I was shaking. I didn’t even pretend to think about it. I made an offer, struck a deal, and became the owner of a 1997 Honda Shadow ACE. Two-tone red and tan. Chrome for days. It looked like the kind of bike you’d see in a movie and think, *Yeah, that’s a proper cruiser.*

This time, I made myself a promise.

*I will not let this one go.*

And I didn’t. I rode it everywhere. Rain, cold, wind—it didn’t matter. That bike brought me back to life. It wasn’t just about speed or freedom anymore. It was about reclaiming something I thought I’d lost forever.

But just when it all felt right again… the problems started.

She’d run fine for a bit, and then—out of nowhere—stall. Dead. Nothing. It always happened once the engine warmed up. I checked everything I could. Fuel. Spark. Plugs. Wires. It didn’t make sense. And each time it happened, it chipped away at my joy.

Eventually, I took it to a local mechanic. He thought he had it solved—something about coils or the CDI box. I didn’t care. I just wanted to ride without fear of getting stranded.

And I did. For a while.

But one warm afternoon, mid-ride, she died again. Same issue. Same frustration. That feeling of betrayal—of pouring your heart into something, only to get burned—came back full force.

I snapped.

I threw the bike on a trailer, strapped it down, and headed to the shop. But just as I turned onto his street, I heard that sickening sound—*thud.*

The strap had snapped.

My Shadow—*my* bike—had tipped in the trailer and slammed into the rail. I pulled over, heart in my throat, and saw the dent in the tank. It wasn’t just a dent. It was a scar. A fresh wound on something I loved.

I stood there staring at it. Furious. Heartbroken. Helpless.

All I wanted to do was ride.

And yet here I was again—fighting ghosts, chasing a dream that kept slipping through my fingers.

I pulled into the mechanic’s driveway, got out, and stared at the bike for a long time before unloading it. I was quiet. Numb. But somewhere deep inside, something shifted.

Maybe it was time to stop chasing fixes.

Maybe it was time to start chasing something bigger.

Maybe it was time to go after the dream I’d carried since I first learned what it meant to *really* ride.

And this time, I wasn’t asking for permission.

**Chapter Four: The Indian Dream**

I was working the night shift at the time, scrolling through the internet like I’d done a hundred times before—mindlessly drifting from bike to bike. But that night, something felt different. The screen wasn’t just a distraction. It was a mirror. And in that reflection, I saw the truth I’d been ignoring for too long.

I didn’t just *want* another motorcycle.

I *needed* one.

But not just any bike. I needed *the* bike—the one I should’ve chased years ago. The one that had lived in the back of my mind like a quiet heartbeat, waiting for its moment.

I’d never said it out loud because it felt too far away. Too big. Too bold.

But deep down, I’d always known: I wanted an Indian.

Not because of engine specs. Not because of popularity. Not because of some loud marketing campaign.

It was a feeling. A calling.

Some guys are Harley guys. Others swear by Honda or Yamaha. Me? I was an Indian guy. Always had been. I just hadn’t been brave enough—or ready enough—to admit it until now.

A lot of it goes back to *The World’s Fastest Indian*. The first time I saw Burt Munro’s story, something inside me clicked. Here was this scrappy, stubborn Kiwi with an ancient Indian Scout and a dream bigger than his budget. He poured everything he had—his time, his sweat, his soul—into that bike just to chase speed across a desert of salt.

He didn’t do it for fame. He didn’t do it for money. He did it because he *had* to.

And man, did that stick with me.

That movie didn’t just inspire me—it carved itself into my bones. Every scene, every speech, every roar of that Indian engine became part of the way I saw motorcycles—and part of how I saw myself.

The very next day, I picked up the phone and called the nearest Indian dealership.

“I want to buy a Scout Bobber Sixty,” I said. No hesitation. No backup plan. Just certainty, like I’d rehearsed that sentence my whole life.

And for the first time in a long damn time… everything just clicked.

The guy fixing my Shadow? He bought it from me the same day. I loaded up my trailer—this time with a wheel chock, not taking any more chances—and hit the road. Ninety miles of buzzing anticipation, my heart pounding louder with each passing mile.

And then I saw it—that massive red Indian Motorcycle sign, bold against the sky.

Pulling into that lot felt like walking into a dream I never thought I’d touch. My boots hit the pavement, and I walked through the doors with fire in my chest. I wasn’t here to look. I wasn’t here to fantasize. I was here to *become*.

They rolled it out—sleek, black, and mean as hell. The Scout Bobber Sixty.

I swung a leg over it and thumbed the starter.

The engine snarled to life, and in that instant, I wasn’t tired anymore. I wasn’t broke, or broken, or doubting myself.

I was alive.

That V-twin breathed into me like oxygen after drowning. All the bullshit I’d been through—the mechanical failures, the stranded roadsides, the heartbreak of letting go of bikes I loved—it all evaporated in the roar of that engine.

I signed the papers with a grin I couldn’t wipe off if I tried. It wasn’t just a transaction—it was a transformation. A turning point.

The whole drive home, I kept glancing in the rearview mirror just to make sure it was real. That it wasn’t a dream I’d wake up from.

When I pulled into my driveway, I unstrapped the Scout, rolled it off the trailer, and fired it up again. I didn’t even take my boots off—I went straight for a ride.

And *damn*, did I ride.

That first twist of the throttle on home turf felt like baptism. Like redemption. Like stepping into the life I was always meant to live.

Because this wasn’t just another bike.

This was *the* bike.

And I wasn’t just some guy who liked motorcycles anymore.

I was a rider.

Every time I fired that Scout up, I felt it in my chest—that pulse, that rhythm that only another rider knows. That bike didn’t just rumble. It spoke. It reminded me that I wasn’t just living to survive—I was living to *feel*.

I started taking the long way everywhere. Groceries? Long way. Late night shift? Long way. Any excuse to ride, I took it. Not to escape—but to come home to myself.

Some nights, I’d pull off on a quiet country road, kill the engine, and just sit there. Listening to the tick of cooling metal, the rustle of grass in the breeze, the distant chirp of crickets. That silence—the kind only a motorcycle ride can give you—became sacred.

It gave me peace. It gave me clarity. It gave me *purpose*.

People ask me all the time: “Why Indian? Why not Harley?”

I just smile.

They don’t get it. And maybe they never will.

This wasn’t about brand loyalty or being part of a crowd. This was about chasing a feeling I first tasted years ago on a clapped-out Honda Shadow. A feeling I lost, chased down, and finally—*finally*—held in my hands again.

This Indian wasn’t just a motorcycle.

It was proof.

Proof that no matter how many times I got knocked down, I’d always find my way back to two wheels.

Proof that I was never meant to walk through this life—I was meant to *ride* through it.

I leaned into that first real corner back home, feeling the tires bite into the pavement, the wind tugging at my jacket, and I swore to myself:

*I’m never going back.*

I’d been without a throttle too many times. I’d seen the emptiness, the frustration, the aching silence it left behind.

Not again.

This was the start of something new. A chapter I didn’t want to end.

Because now?

Now I was riding for *me*.

And this time?

I wasn’t letting go.

 

**Chapter Five: The One That Changed It All**

I truly believe that motorcycle changed how I feel about motorcycles altogether. Yeah, I’ve always been obsessed—eat, breathe, dream kind of obsessed—but that Scout Bobber Sixty? That one flipped a switch in me I didn’t even know existed.

It wasn’t just another bike. It was *the* bike. The one where everything I’d been chasing since I first wrapped my hands around a throttle finally came together. It was like all the miles, all the breakdowns, all the heartache—it was all leading to *that* machine.

That bike didn’t just take me places. It *took me in*.

Every town I could reach, every back road with no name, every stretch of open highway that dared me to go a little further—I was there. Just me and the Scout. I didn’t need a reason. I didn’t need a plan. Sometimes I’d head out just to feel the wind in my chest and the weight of the world peel off behind me.

It’s hard to explain exactly what changed. Maybe it was finally owning the Indian I’d dreamt about for so long. Maybe it was how the bike fit me—how it felt like it had been waiting for me all along, built for no one else. Or maybe it was that I’d finally come out the other side of all the bullshit—financial struggles, busted bikes, hard goodbyes—and found something that made it all make sense.

Whatever it was, something inside me shifted the day I rode that Scout home. And I haven’t been the same since.

But eventually… I felt it again.

That pull.

Not because I wanted to let go of the Scout—I loved that bike like a part of me—but because I was ready for the next chapter. I’d tasted freedom. Now I wanted more. I wanted to go further, ride longer. I needed something that could carry more than just me—I needed something that could carry *my life*.

So I did what any totally sane, motorcycle-obsessed addict would do: I traded the Scout in and rolled out of the dealership on an Indian Springfield Dark Horse.

And holy hell, what a machine.

Blacked out, mean, and muscular as hell. That bike didn’t whisper freedom—it *roared* it. From the moment I threw a leg over it, I knew I hadn’t just stepped up to a new bike. I’d stepped into the rider I was always meant to be.

This wasn’t a midlife crisis.

This was a *midlife awakening*.

I’ve owned that Springfield for a few years now. We’ve chased sunsets across state lines, stared down thunderstorms, powered through blistering summer heat and the kind of wind that tries to rip you clean off the road. And that bike? It’s never let me down. It doesn’t just carry me—it carries *everything I’ve become*.

Every time I fire it up, I get that same gut-deep feeling I had the first time I twisted a throttle. That thrill. That clarity. That *rightness*.

Lately though, I’ve started to feel the itch again. But this time, it’s different. It’s not about more horsepower or shinier chrome. It’s about *living* more. It’s about waking up to the sound of the wind in the trees, cooking coffee over a camp stove beside the bike, and riding into the unknown with nothing but a map in my head and the road under my wheels.

So I started collecting moto camping gear—tent, tools, cooking kit, the whole works. Not because it’s trendy. Not because I want to post cool pictures.

Because I want to *live* it.

I want to be like those riders I used to stare at as a kid—dusty, sunburned, grinning wide under bug-splattered helmets. The ones who didn’t just ride motorcycles, but *rode into life*.

This isn’t a phase. It’s not a weekend hobby.

It’s a way of life now. A commitment.

A promise to myself that I’ll never go back to feeling empty. That I’ll never let life tame me. That I’ll always chase that feeling—the one I found the first time I cracked open a throttle and felt the world open up.

I don’t know exactly where I’m headed next. But I know this:

I’ll get there on two wheels.

 

**Chapter Six: Throttle Wide Open**

If there’s one thing motorcycles have taught me—beyond the thrill, the freedom, and that deep soul-reset they bring—it’s this:

You can chase down any dream if you’re willing to twist the throttle and hold on.

This journey wasn’t just about machines. It wasn’t about chrome or horsepower or how loud the pipes were. It was about something much deeper—something personal. It was about digging myself out of every setback, every heartbreak, every broken-down mile of life, and finding *me* again. On two wheels. With the wind at my back and nothing ahead but possibility.

There were so many nights where I wasn’t sure I’d ever get here. Nights I laid awake staring at the ceiling, feeling like I’d never afford another bike. Nights when I saw people riding past and it felt like watching a world I was no longer a part of—like the gates to that life had closed on me. Nights I beat myself up for selling bikes I loved, for letting go when I didn’t want to, for thinking maybe the dream wasn’t meant for me after all.

But something inside me never let go. Even when I wasn’t riding, I was still a rider. That identity, that fire, it never died. It just went quiet for a while. Waiting.

And when I finally got back on a bike—*really* got back, with that Indian Scout Bobber Sixty—it was like flipping a switch and waking up a version of myself that had been asleep for far too long. That first ride wasn’t just exciting—it was emotional. It was like finally hearing your own voice again after years of silence. Like finding the missing piece of yourself that you thought was lost forever.

I used to think motorcycles were just machines. Beautiful machines, yes—but still just steel and gas and rubber. But now I know better.

They’re time machines. They’re therapists. They’re soul-reclaimers.

That Scout taught me what it meant to truly *connect* with a bike. It wasn’t just about the ride anymore—it was about everything I’d gone through to get there. Every twist of the throttle felt like a victory. Every mile felt like I was writing a new chapter of my life in real time, leaving the past behind and burning forward into something brand new.

This whole thing… it’s not a hobby anymore.

It’s not even just a passion.

It’s a *way of life*.

It’s a promise I made to myself the moment I threw a leg over that first beat-up $500 Shadow: **no matter what happens, never stop riding**. Never stop chasing what sets your soul on fire. Never let go of the throttle.

Because dreams don’t show up with a ribbon and a full tank. You have to grind for them. Fail for them. Hustle, scrap, and sometimes bleed for them.

But if you hold on long enough, twist hard enough, and believe just a little deeper than the rest?

You’ll get there.

I did.

Today, I’m riding that Springfield. I’ve got a garage that smells like fuel and rubber and freedom. I’ve got gear stacked and ready. And I’ve got a heart full of miles still waiting to be ridden.

 

So if you’re reading this, and you’re wondering if it’s too late for you…

If you’re standing on the edge of your dream, unsure whether to leap…

I’m here to tell you: *Do it.*

Twist that throttle and go.

Because the road doesn’t care who you used to be—it only cares that you show up.

**This story is dedicated to the people and the adventures I made along the way—each one of you helped shape the rider I’ve become.**

**And to WDH—Rest in Peace.**  
*Thank you for helping me pave the road. Your incredible knowledge and adventure helped us learn a lot together. I love you brother.*

 *I’ll carry you with me on every ride.*

Keep two wheels down folks.

Hey there – I’m a 32M in the Pittsburgh area looking to expand my circle and hopefully find someone I really click with, whether that ends up as close friendship or something deeper.

I’m into deep convos, music, movies, video games, cooking, animals, and probably way too much weed (but hey, I’m chill about it – not a personality trait). I’ve got longish dark brown hair usually in a bun, glasses, a beard, some tattoos, and piercings if that paints a picture. 5’8”, 220 lbs, warm vibes.

I’d love to find someone local who wants to hang out often – hit up coffee shops, explore new spots around the city, have cozy nights with good food and music, maybe get lost in a record store or park. If we vibe and something romantic blooms, awesome – if we just become close friends, that’s just as good.

If you’re in or near Pittsburgh and any of this resonates with you, drop me a message. Let’s get to know each other and see where it goes.

My gf and I moved to Utah four years ago during the pandemic, and have really grown to love living in Liberty Wells. Now that we have both an In-N-Out and Trader Joe's within easy biking distance, one thing we've felt is still missing near 2100 S and 300-700 E is a specialty coffee shop that served those of us further away from Picnic/Loki. 

An opportunity came up recently when our friends from Pretty Bird Hot Chicken mentioned that the unused pickup window at their Sugarhouse location would be a great coffee window, so that's where I've set up shop for the past few weeks. It's been fun building a small local business from scratch and meeting the people who live and work in the community, something I didn't get to do much of when I worked a remote job.

If you enjoy modern light roast drinks or just want to geek out about espresso, please come say hi. We're open Mon-Wed 8-12, Sun 10-2. My plan is to keep expanding the operating hours alongside a menu that will also have non-espresso options (cold brew, matcha/teas, breakfast options).

1jtwkqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jtwkqb/we_started_getting_letters_from_a_child_we_dont/,We started getting letters from a child we don't have....,"I found the first letter on a Tuesday.

It didn’t come in the mail, not really. It was just there; in our mailbox, no stamp, no postmark, no return address. Just our names written in a child’s handwriting.

""*Mara and Eli*.""

Inside, on a single sheet of folded notebook paper, was this:

""*Hi Mom and Dad,*

*You don’t know me yet, but I’m your son. I’m writing from the future. I just wanted to say thank you. You’re doing everything right. I’ll see you soon.*

*Love, Me*.""

 

We laughed, at first. We thought it was a prank. Maybe one of the neighborhood kids had slipped it in. It was cute. Innocent. We saved it on the fridge for fun.

The second letter arrived a week later. This time, it was inside the house. I found it on the kitchen counter, beside the coffee pot. No one had been in. No signs of a break-in. Nothing stolen. The doors were locked. We had no cameras, but we were always careful. Still, there it was.

""*Hi again,*

*Mara, your headaches are from the water. It’s the pipes. Don’t drink it anymore.*

*Eli, bring an umbrella on Thursday. You’ll need it.*

*I love you.*

*-Me*""

 

Mara had been having migraines for weeks. Her doctor thought it was stress, maybe hormones. But she stopped drinking the tap water and switched to bottled. Within three days, the headaches vanished. Thursday brought an unexpected hailstorm. Everyone at the office was drenched. I was dry.

After that, we stopped laughing. We didn’t talk about it at first. We just… obeyed. Quietly. Unsure why. The letters were always right. Helpful. Loving. They felt real.

They started arriving regularly.



The third letter told us not to attend a birthday party we’d RSVP’d to weeks before. It was vague:

""*Please don’t go to the party on Saturday. Something bad will happen. But you’ll be safe if you stay home. I promise*.""

We stayed home. The next day, the news reported a carbon monoxide leak at the event hall. Several people were hospitalized. One person died.

The following letter said:

""*Thank you. That would have been very bad for us*.""

We started saving every letter. They felt… sacred.

They always came when we were alone. Always in strange places: under pillows, inside cupboards, once even inside the fridge, folded neatly between two cartons of eggs. Each note felt warmer, more intimate. More personal. They began using our childhood stories- ones we’d only ever shared in whispers.

""*Mom, remember the pink shoes you buried in the woods behind grandma’s house? I found them. They were still there. Thank you.""*

Mara burst into tears. She hadn’t thought of those shoes in twenty years.

""*Dad, the letter you wrote to your grandpa before he died? He read it. He says thank you*.""

My knees buckled. I had burned that letter before ever sending it.



Then the warnings began. They were subtle at first.

""*Don’t answer Aunt Lydia’s calls anymore. She doesn’t believe in me. She’s going to make you forget*.""

We ignored that one. Lydia came to visit the next week. She walked through our house, sat on our couch, and said she felt ‘something wrong’ in the air. She kept asking if we were okay. If we were sleeping. If we were eating. She left us a dreamcatcher and told Mara to wear lavender on her wrists.

The letter that night said:

""*She saw too much. You have to be careful*.""

Two days later, Lydia’s car crashed on a mountain road. She survived, but she was in a coma for two weeks. We never called her again.



By the time the pregnancy test came back positive, we didn’t question it. It didn’t matter that we hadn’t planned for children. It didn’t matter that I’d had a vasectomy five years earlier.

""Miracle,"" Mara whispered.

""Destiny,"" I said.

We held hands in the kitchen, trembling. The house felt too still. Outside, the wind stopped. The letter was already on the counter:

""*He’s coming. Thank you for making it possible*.""



The letters became more frequent. More urgent.

""*Don’t trust the man with the dog who walks past at 8:15. He’s watching us*.""

""*Don’t let the doctor touch Mom’s stomach. He’ll feel something he’s not supposed to*.""

""*Don’t look into the mirror for too long*.""

We didn’t know what that meant. But after a while, we couldn’t. Our reflections began to move out of sync.



The pregnancy progressed rapidly. By what should have been week twelve, Mara looked full-term. She didn’t gain weight. Her skin remained smooth, flawless. But her stomach grew, and the skin over it pulsed faintly, like something underneath was testing the boundaries. She didn’t sleep much. When she did, she murmured in a language I didn’t recognize.

The letters still addressed us lovingly.

""*You’re both doing so well. I’m so proud of you.""*

*""Don’t listen to anyone else. They’ll try to keep us apart.""*

*""You have to protect me. We’re almost ready*.""



Then came the letter about Mr. Halberd, our neighbor.

""*He knows. He’s been watching you. He’s going to ruin everything. You have to stop him*.""

We were scared. We believed it. Halberd had always been nosy, sure- but lately, he had been stopping by more. Asking strange questions.

""You folks expecting? You look different. This house… something about it feels wrong now.""

The next note said:

""*He’s lying. He always has. He hurt children once. He’d hurt me too. Do what you need to do*.""



Mara convinced me to confront him. It wasn’t supposed to happen like it did.

But it did.

Halberd fell down the stairs. His neck broke. We didn’t call the police. We buried him under the garden shed. We found a letter in the soil the next morning:

""*Thank you. He won’t interfere anymore*.""



Mara went into labor that night.

That’s when the sky turned black. Not cloudy. Not stormy. Just… black. Like someone had painted over the sky with tar and forgot to leave room for the stars.

The power flickered once, then died. Every light, every outlet. My phone screen refused to turn on, even with a full charge. The clocks froze at 11:44. Outside the window, there were no streetlights, no moonlight. Just a black wall where the world used to be. Even sound felt muffled, like we were wrapped in cotton.

Mara screamed. It wasn’t a cry of pain. It was something else. Her voice didn’t echo; it seemed to collapse in on itself, the sound falling flat in the air like it wasn’t allowed to leave the room.

And then it stopped. Her eyes rolled back. Her mouth hung open, and from her lips came a voice that wasn’t hers. Not deep, not monstrous- just wrong. Like a hundred whispers trying to form one word. I leaned close, trying to understand. 

She convulsed once, twice, then went completely still. Her stomach bulged and contracted in slow, rhythmic pulses. Something was moving beneath the skin. Not kicking- shifting. Like it was stretching, unfolding.

I backed away. The room felt hotter by the second. The walls pulsed with a dull red hue, as if lit from behind veins. The floor vibrated beneath my feet in perfect sync with Mara’s breaths- deep, dragging, unnatural.

There was no blood. No contractions. Just silence and movement.

Then came the sound; a high-pitched whine, like metal scraping against bone. It came from Mara’s mouth, eyes, fingertips. Her skin began to glow. And just as quickly, it stopped. Her belly went still. Her eyes fluttered open. She looked at me- really looked at me- and smiled.

""It’s okay now,"" she said.

I dropped to my knees beside her. The glow in her skin faded. And then, slowly, impossibly, she reached down and pulled something out of herself. Not screaming, not shaking. Calm. Serene.

What she held was not a baby. It was shaped like one, sure. But the proportions were wrong. Limbs too long. Eyes too large. Skin smooth and translucent like polished stone. It blinked at me. Its mouth opened into a crooked smile. And I- God help me- I smiled back.

We didn’t sleep that night. Not because we were afraid. Because the baby- our son- didn’t want us to. He didn’t cry. He didn’t fuss. He just stared, wide-eyed, from the little nest of blankets we laid him in on the living room floor. His eyes never closed. Not once.

""He doesn’t blink,” Mara said around 3 a.m.,

I hadn’t noticed. But she was right. He watched us constantly, like he was memorizing us. Studying us. Like we were a test and he was waiting for the results. And we felt proud. Grateful.

There were no more letters. None the next morning. None the next week. But there were… changes.

Mara no longer needed food. Not really. She’d pick at toast, sip at tea, but nothing else. She stopped sleeping entirely, yet never seemed tired. She said her dreams now lived outside of her. That he had taken them from her ""for safekeeping.""

I kept working, going through the motions. But people looked at me differently. My coworkers asked if I was okay. One even reached out and grabbed my arm like he thought I was about to collapse.

""You’ve been losing weight,"" he said. ""You look… pale.""

I looked in the mirror that night. And I didn’t recognize myself. But when I turned away, I saw my reflection blink- and I hadn’t. The next letter came two weeks later. It wasn’t in the mailbox. It was in the crib. Folded beneath our son’s body, like a note left in a bassinet at a fire station. It was different. Printed, not handwritten. Sharp letters, uniform and cold.



Phase 1 complete.  
Secondary conditioning successful.  
Intervention no longer necessary.  
Initiate localization.



We didn’t understand what it meant. Until the dreams started. Not for us- for others.

We got a call from a friend in New York, terrified. She said she dreamed of us, but not how we are. She saw us in a house with no windows. Holding something that looked like a child but wasn’t. Smiling, rocking it, singing lullabies in a language she couldn’t understand. She woke up crying. Then the dreams spread. Relatives. Coworkers. Strangers. People messaged us, confused. Disturbed.

“We saw you.”

“We saw him.”

“He told us things. He told us what’s coming.”

He. Not “it.” He had a name now. And then, he spoke it. To us. Out loud. Just one word, in a language we couldn’t place. But it cracked the glass on the coffee table. Sent every dog on the block into a howling frenzy. Mara dropped to her knees and whispered,

“Yes. Yes, I hear you.”

The house felt smaller after that. Warmer. The walls pulsed, slightly, like lungs. The lights no longer worked, but we didn’t need them. Everything inside glowed softly, like it had its own hidden sun.



I stopped going to work. I couldn’t remember what my job had been anyway.

Mara spent all day with him. Cradling him. Speaking to him in strange murmurs, her head tilted like she was listening to music I couldn’t hear. Sometimes she’d hum- not a lullaby, but something more primal, like static turned into a melody.

I started finding drawings on the walls. Childlike scribbles at first. Then more complex. Circles within circles, jagged geometry, sharp lines forming impossible angles. I tried to wipe them off. They wouldn’t smudge. They were drawn in something that wasn’t ink.

I woke one morning to find a spiral traced on my chest in fine red lines. Not a wound. More like a tattoo that had always been there. That’s when I knew he’d started using me, too.

The next letter didn’t come on paper. It came through the radio. The kitchen radio hadn’t worked since the blackout, but it turned on by itself at 2:17 a.m. White noise at first. Then a child’s voice:

“*You’ve both done beautifully. It’s almost time*. *Please make room. Others are coming*.”

The sound looped once. Then the radio exploded.



It started raining the next day. Black rain. Thick and slow, like oil. It didn’t splash. It stuck.

The sky above us had not returned. There was no sun. No clouds. Just that awful velvet void, like we lived beneath a blanket that didn’t want to be removed.

I tried to call my brother. The line clicked and opened into silence. Then I heard him breathing. Then crying. Then a voice- our son’s voice- saying,

“He’s not ready.”

Mara was ready. She started setting up the house. Rearranging the furniture. She said they needed a nursery. Not for him. For them.

“They’re coming through soon,” she told me one night while folding linens. “He’s made it safe for them now.”

“Who?” I asked, because I didn’t want to believe I already knew.

She looked at me with those wide, glowing eyes and said,

“The others.”



Two nights later, we watched from the porch as the man across the street walked into his front yard, dropped to his knees, and carved a circle into his chest using the edge of a broken CD.

He was smiling the entire time.

When I ran to him, he was already gone. But on his shirt, written in something that might have been blood- or something worse- was one word:

“Ready.”



We stopped getting mail. No trucks came down the street anymore. No deliveries. No neighbors.

The homes around us went dark, one by one. Some remained standing; shadows behind their windows. Others collapsed in on themselves overnight, like paper folding into ash. Still, we stayed. Because he told us to.

The house had changed. The doors no longer opened outward. Behind every door was another room of the house. The living room, the kitchen, the nursery. They had multiplied, endless variations of the same three places, looping deeper and deeper the more you opened. I once passed through seven living rooms before finding Mara again. She said it was better this way.

“We need room for everyone.”

The next letter was scratched into the inside of the refrigerator:

“*He’s almost ready to be born again*.”

We didn’t understand.

“He’s already here,” I whispered.

“No,” Mara said, gently. “That was just the beginning.”

That night, he changed. He grew. Not larger, but deeper. He felt heavier in our arms, like he contained more space than the outside of his body suggested. His eyes no longer blinked- they shifted. Like you were never quite looking at them directly, no matter where you stood.

He called me by my real name. Not Eli. The one no one knew. Not even Mara. And when I asked him how he knew it, he said,

“I gave it to you.”



We found the final letter in our bed. Folded neatly, resting on our pillows. This one wasn’t signed.

*""The bridge is built.*  
*The hosts are prepared.*  
*The signal will arrive soon.*  
*Do not interfere.""*

The walls began to hum. The black sky tore open. But it didn’t reveal stars. It revealed an eye. Huge. Pulsing. Watching. And it blinked. We didn’t scream when the sky blinked. We knelt. Everyone did.

Across the street, from what houses remained, figures emerged. Staggering. Praying. Chanting in tongues that didn’t belong to any language we knew. Some we recognized. Some we didn’t. All of them watched the sky and waited.

And our son- our beautiful, impossible son- smiled.

“Now you see,” he said.

He wasn’t a child anymore. Not in the way we understood. His body hadn’t aged, but his presence filled the house like gravity. He bent the air. Light avoided him. Shadows bowed.

“We didn’t mean to help *this*,” I told Mara.

She didn’t answer. She was no longer Mara. Not really.



It started three nights ago.

I found her standing in the hallway, tracing the spiral on her chest. She said it itched. Said it moved when she looked away. She whispered that she’d started dreaming of herself, from the outside, watching her own body carry out instructions she hadn’t consciously heard. She didn’t fight it. I think a part of her had been gone for weeks.

And now… there was no more denying it. The air crackled with electricity. The ground shook in pulses. The eye in the sky blinked once more.

Then the letter appeared. Not in the house. In my mind.

A voice. Warm. Familiar.

*""You were never meant to survive me.*  
*Only to usher me in.*

*The locks have been undone.*  
*The veil, rewritten.*  
*The shape of the world bent back to its origin-*  
*to me.*

*I did not come to destroy your world.*  
*I came to replace it.*

*You were the prayer.*  
*And now, you are the silence that follows it.*

*There will be no aftermath.*  
*No reckoning.*  
*Only continuity-*  
 *in my shape, in my image,*  
 *and in the names that come after yours are forgotten.*

*Sleep now.*  
*The new world does not require your witness.""*

I tried to scream, but my mouth no longer worked. I tried to run, but my legs were no longer mine. Mara turned to me one last time. She opened her mouth. And in our son’s voice, she said:

Trying to drive with the handbrake on felt so tiring and lonely, wondering forever what was wrong with me and never figuring it out until the diagnosis last week. I’m now reading about all your experiences with the same condition and it make me feel less alone, that l’m not crazy. 

I don’t feel tethered to life so I always consciously have to choose it. It’s not living, merely surviving. I don’t want to live like this anymore, I don’t think I can. I have to try everything I can I get better. Since my diagnosis I booked appointments with two psychiatrists, so I can compare their approaches and the meds they will prescribe. I booked an appointment with an ACT therapist as well and I’m going to book acupuncture sessions too. I will also search for a source of pscilocybin to microdose. There is so much research on it now. Do you guys listen to the Depresh mode podcast?

Now I’m also thinking of activities to feel more alive, skydiving, or bungee jumping, I’m afraid of heights but I just want to feel something. I’m also doing a 5 day water fast this month to try and reset my dopamine receptors. I already take cold showers and go to the gym 4 times a week and walk 10km every day. I try to watch more comedy and stand up acts. I have to try all the ways I could feel better without unhealthy cheap dopamine hits. I stopped watching corn, smoking, drinking coffee or alcohol a while ago. I felt I had to get comfortable with the discomfort, and find out what the pain is trying to tell me. 

Now comes the real question, how to find purpose and hope? Could it be found in stoicism, acceptance and gratitude despite the hardship? In spirituality? I’m thinking a lot of a verse from the Quran when I’m down, it says that « God does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear » (2:286), that I’m therefore strong enough to bear this pain.

I think dysthymia can also make us very compassionate as we know and understand pain, it also makes us sensitive to others, we can hold space for people and care about them, and we can love deeply. Perhaps a life of service, helping others and giving will give us purpose or just doing the best we can, and keep trying. Perhaps that is the purpose, to keep doing the work and keep trying every day, putting on the smile and trying to stay afloat amongst the other swimmers even when no one sees the weights pulling us down. Finding comfort and pride in our courage to keep living. 

How do you all find purpose and hope? Can you share the moments of glimmer, satisfaction and joy you manage to create or feel? ",1,1744060189.0,dysthymia,1,1.0,False

It's got the cargo capacity and lift power to fuel my ambitions and nuclear weapons program (earlier posts for details and photos). I've just spent a good few minutes talking through design changes with my Deputy Chief Designer (wife's Labrador; Chief Designer is still asleep) with my morning coffee. But it brings me to asteroids, and specifically their respawn rates.

About 8KM from my main base is a large asteroid. And this thing has it all; platinum, iron, magnesium, silicon, and the rest. But no uranium. Because I strip-mined that out on my 4th visit (discover and scouting on trip 1, built up some infrastructure on trips 2 and 3). Because I enjoy 'For All Mankind' I named the asteroid Goldilocks. I'll still hit it up when I need the other resources for the big ol' capital ship I have planned, but for now, it's all about uranium.

And that's all gone. So I went further. And found a nice belt of asteroids about 34KM out. And the best bit is these ones respawn. So I can strip all the uranium out, fly home, muck around for a bit, then go out again. But it's a long flight out and back comparatively, and while I've got an autopilot built it, it is time lost.

So why is it that the asteroids in The Belt refresh, and Goldilocks stays as it was the last time I went there. Is it because I've got a mining base built there? Or is it within a set distance of my main base? I've definitely been out of spawn range and out of line of sight. The only thing I can think of is that trash timer thing that cleans up stuff, and that the uranium is within the set distance of infrastructure for that not to trigger.

Or is there anything else? I'll run it by Chief Designer as well (nice break from talking about Bluey), but would appreciate any input.",5,1744060156.0,spaceengineers,0,1.0,False

I'm a non traditional soon to be 38 year old in college. I'm almost halfway done with my degree alternating part time and full time classes.  I work full time (sometimes overtime) so I'm a bit tired and on top of that my commute is hour each way from my home to either work or school.

I was explaining to my classmates today during my functional anatomy class (we have a lab once a week) that I was incredibly sore and stiff from working the past week (I have degenerative disc disease and hip arthritis too), and haven't been able to stretch or really get limber especially at 8:30 in the morning.  Our lab was trying out different exercises for a functional movement screening tool, and I of course couldn't get my hips to cooperate today so I had to tap out and just fill in for all the spots on the lab paperwork, little to no movement. None of this is a big deal to the professor (he knows my situation).  Its just a practice in the lab for later on in life in a professional setting. Like literally, on my sheet I just put 0 or 1 in the spaces for little to no movement, and explain the muscle movements.  It has no effect on their grade, just mine, they just grade the movement. 

Anyhow explaining to classmates, that I'm not exactly the most flexible person after rolling out of bed a couple hours earlier and feeling like shit from working all week was a huge pain.  It's literally a 1 pt lab and the professor gives out tons of extra credit along with easy tests and quizzes as long as you know most of your anatomy and how it moves. Its just frustrating to try and explain that I can't move right now but later on in the afternoon after my 17th cup of coffee, I'll be able to go squat and do my bench just fine.

A genuine connection. I’m not chasing labels or rushing into anything just open to something built on trust, depth, and presence. If it turns into a relationship, great. If it becomes a meaningful friendship, that’s just as valuable.

A bit about me:

By day, I’m a coder. I also have a master’s degree in nuclear physics and I’m preparing for my PhD which means lots of studying and a few late-night brain farts (GRE & TOEFL). Life can be intense, but I balance it with calm moments and simple joys.

I love long conversations over coffee, night walks, and getting lost in the quiet parts of a city. I prefer the hidden alleys where the real stories live.

One day, I will ride a motorcycle across Europe. The back seat’s open. maybe you’re the right kind of adventure?

Still planning my first tattoo, but first, I’m working on getting in shape. Got any ideas or cool ink stories? I’m all ears.

What I’m looking for:

Emotional maturity. Calm, kind energy. A connection where we can be real, not perform. I’m not into surface-level stuff. Just looking for someone who enjoys depth, curiosity, and the kind of quiet that doesn’t need to be filled.

The reason why we broke up is I started having life altering health issues. This flipped my whole life on its head. I no longer could/can go to the gym and lift, rock climb, drink alcohol, or even coffee, and I am in fairly constant pain. Basically all of my outlets were ripped away from me in a blink of an eye. As a result, this led me to be anxious, insecure, and ultimately a shell of the person I once was. I was holding myself up strong… but after coming home from a vacation to the harsh reality of my life… i broke. Upon doing so I leaned on my girlfriend a little too hard for a few days. I was lovebombing, oversharing, and seeking validation that WE were okay because it made ME feel okay. After about 3 days of this, she brought to my attention what I was doing. That I was smothering her. I have been on the flip side of this in past relationships and know how it felt and immediately changed my actions. It however was too late. 

These anxiously attached actions (even though in normal health I am secure) triggered her avoidant attachment. She slowly began drifting away from me over the course of a month. There were ups and downs, but ultimately she “fell out of love” with me. We “mutually” broke up after about a month of weird distance from her. But really she broke up with me. I chased after this… clinging onto the only part of my normal life I felt I had left. I did this for about a week but she assured me this was the end and we are breaking up. When we initially broke up she said “some ex’s get back together”. But after chasing for that week she said “i have no intentions of getting back together”. 

We had a music festival planned for June and the wristbands are arriving at my house. I told her “lets stay no contact until those wristbands arrive”. This would be about 2.5 months after the breakup. 2.5 months of NC. Me trying to gain some control back. 

I find myself still having hope for some reason. I gave this girl the world and was an amazing boyfriend. I havent always been to others in the past but this time I was ready for love and proved it every time. She said nobody has ever made her feel loved and accepted and appreciated the way I made her feel. When these wristbands come, i have this fantasy in my head that we will reconnect and work all this out. The only thing is that its still a month and a half away. I feel like I cant keep holding onto this hope for another month and a half as she is all I can think about night and day. Its getting in the way of my job, my mental health, and my healing journey physically. Im immensely depressed. For that reason, I feel like I need to reach out. Asking her if this is really what she wants and see if she has any remorse. Breaking No Contact so I can hopefully heal fully whether she accepts or denies me. If she says no, then I can delete her number, burn the love letters, delete the pictures of us in my phone and finally move on. I keep going back to these in moments of weakness. 

Would it be weak to break NC for this? Should I tough it out and wait another month and a half and see what happens then? I fear i may wait all that time and she will deny me then, setting me back when I could have just reached out now and started healing fully so much earlier. I dont care for mind games, whos right and whos wrong, I just want my sanity back. 

What do we think? I know this was long but I could really use some advice. ",1,1744059694.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I noticed everything about you in that moment. Etched every detail into the fabric of my mind. The way your smile didn't curl at the edges. The little wrinkles in the corners of your eyes. The way their green color was still so stunning through their squints. How your hair was so messy, but the mess made you all the more beautiful. I couldn't forget that moment if I tried.

But that giggle. It wove its way into the spaces between my ribs and settled around my heart. I had never felt something so surreal about anyone in my life.

Safe from anyone or anything that dare attempt to tear you down. 

It made me want to learn everything about you. From the tiny icks that made your lip curl to your biggest dreams and deepest aspirations. I knew right then I wanted to show you how gentle life can be. I wanted to strip away your insecurities and all of your doubt. Show you that no matter how broken you may feel, that someone can help you pick up the pieces and place them where they deserve to be. I want you to show me every part of you that you don’t love, so that I can love them for you. 

I can’t stop thinking about you. It’s as if your fingers have found their way in between the creases of my brain and gripped with a force that Hercules couldn’t break. I

I want to get lost in your gaze on an early Saturday morning. To buy you your favorite flowers when you feel as if the world has forgotten you. I want to swim in the sea of curls that make up your hair, highlighted with beautiful streaks of grey. The way it frames your beauty is marvelous. 

I want to show you that you deserve every ounce of someone. That you’re worthy of so much more than just lust. It’s as if our souls grazed each other’s hands before our eyes ever met. Something about you just feels so right. 

I want to show you that someone can care even in the small ways. The tug of a blanket over your feet. Making sure your coffee has just the right amount of sugar. Or cleaning the mess from dinner alone because you fell asleep on the couch. 

It confuses me why I feel so deeply for you. But at the same time, I’ve never been so certain about anyone in my life. Something drew me to you that night. And I’m so glad that it did.

i know the basics, like dialing in, dosing, pulling shots etc. my milk steaming can use some practice but i pretty much just need to get used to the steam wand and it's power, type of milk etc before getting it right every time. 

but i feel like i get really nervous behind the bar when i'm new to a job. just because there would be people way more experienced than me, and their eyes would be on me every second. my customer service also might feel a bit robotic at times because of my personality...i just have a very reserved personality and if anything goes off script, i get very thrown off so i always try to stick with a set script when taking orders. though if there are regular customers i would probably chat with them a bit more. this coffee shop seems to value a very laid back customer service, and i'm scared i might look robotic. 

the interview seemed to go well but i'm just worried that i might not make a good impression or show a good display of my skills because of nervousness. ",1,1744059073.0,barista,0,1.0,False

i am too tired of it now. i really want to lose it and become better.

back in lockdown (i was 12-13), i got this condition called alopecia, for which i had to take some medicines which included steroids (given that we had tried everywhere and only the medication with steroids would work). this resulted in me gaining a lot of weight (almost 15-20 kgs in 2 months), my testosterone getting fucked, along with my metabolism (sorry for the language but im really frustrated), plus my stamina and strength is REALLY REALLY low (i cant even do 1 push up, or jog for 2 minutes straight).

i dont eat fast food much (probably once a week). my everyday diet is really simple. morning- fruits (usually) or bread butter or poha or halwa or upma, etc. then khaane mein either 2 roti and sabji, or rice daal sabji. snacks mein biscuit or namkeen or fruits, etc. and coffee (thrice a week). then dinner is the same as lunch. js saturdays ko raat mein chicken banta hain so uss ke saath roti and rice dono ho jaata hain.

my 11th has started and i can only go to the gym for an hour or an hour and half. most of my day will go sitting on the chair studying. and i can convince my mother for a basic diet.

i have gymmed before, but it didnt really do much (i didnt follow a diet during that time, and didnt do cardio properly).

i want to at least lose majority of my fat, maybe until i hit 60 kgs, build my stamina and strength. i am ready to avoid fast food. i am ready to avoid sugar completely. i really need to do it. i am tired of being bullied for being fat and seeing myself like this. i dont want to become a bad example. i want to lose it.

When I was in school, I couldn’t wait to graduate and go to college. Then in college, I just wanted to get it over with and start working. But when I started working, it wasn’t long before I began dreaming about the *next* job or the next opportunity.

Even outside of work or school, it shows up. I’ll go on vacation, and after just a couple of days, I’m already thinking, “Alright, I’ve seen what I needed to see. Time to go back home.”

It’s like I’m living life in fast-forward, always sprinting toward a finish line that keeps moving. And no matter how many chapters I close, happiness always feels like it’s just *beyond the next one*.

# The Trap of “I’ll Be Happy When…”

I’ve come to realize this is what’s called the **arrival fallacy**—the belief that happiness will come *after* the next big thing.

But when you’re always chasing that next thing, you never get to actually *live* in the one you’re in.

At some point, I had to stop and ask myself:  
**Why am I so uncomfortable with just being here, right now?**

This constant forward-pushing mindset can be driven by a few things:

* We tie our worth to productivity and achievement.
* We’re uncomfortable with stillness or uncertainty.
* We’ve trained our minds to plan, optimize, and move ahead—so much that slowing down feels wrong.
* And sometimes, we simply fear what might happen if we pause long enough to *feel* the present.

# So How Do You Break the Cycle?

I’m not claiming I’ve figured it all out. But here are a few things I’ve started practicing to *slow down*, even just a little:

# 1. See Life as a Journey, Not a To-Do List

Instead of rushing to *finish* each phase, I’m trying to shift my mindset to:  
“What’s something about this stage I might miss one day?”

It helps me see moments as something to *live through*, not just get over with.

# 2. Be Where Your Feet Are

You don’t need to meditate for 30 minutes a day (unless you want to).  
Sometimes, it's enough to:

* Eat without your phone.
* Sit with your coffee in silence.
* Go for a walk and actually notice the world around you.

Even two minutes of *being present* builds a new habit in the brain.

# 3. Check the Fear Behind the Rush

A helpful journal prompt I use:

>

That question helped me see how often I equate stillness with stagnation or even failure. But that’s not the truth. Stillness is where the real stuff happens—reflection, joy, peace, even growth.

# 4. Micro-Rituals to Anchor You

* A 3-minute gratitude reflection every Friday.
* Replaying one good moment from the day before bed.
* Creating small “celebrations” for the mundane—like lighting a candle after work or walking without headphones.

These rituals might seem silly, but they pull me back into the present moment more often than I expect.

# Final Thoughts

I’m learning that happiness isn’t waiting for me at the next milestone, the next job, or even the next vacation.  
It’s tucked into the little moments I’ve been rushing past for years.

And maybe, the peace I’ve been chasing doesn’t come from finishing another chapter—but from finally learning how to *read the one I’m in.*",1,1744058793.0,4amsadrap,0,1.0,False

I’m just so confused as to what the point of this video is, and maybe they’ll get into it, but I’m bored.

I have narrowed it down that coffee is definitely a huge trigger even black coffee. In addition to having the normal SIBO issues.

My husbands libido is affected by his mental health, he also has some OCD traits that affect his ability to be intimate. On top of all that he's a very selfish and shy lover. He has never had a serious relatio ship where they  lived together snd all his past GFs he claimed orgasmed from penetration alone. I question thisbif these qoman were faking or if I really am the odd duck who orgasms from xlit atimulation only. 
So even though my marriage isn't ""sexless"" ... I am often rejected and when we do have sex it's all on his terms. We have been together a few years now and i have never orgasmed with him. When I can get him to have sex it's the same ace, same time of day, no foreplay, only penetration sex, no oral, no hands, no kissing except on the lips but no tongue, and i always have to be on top. Ive tried everything  .. sent him porn, tried showing him what I want, eve  sex therapy and a million heart to hearts. Nothing changes. The sex therpist gave us homework of non sexual intimate touch and he wouldnt so it. For a while i thought maybe he wasnt attracted to me, but i fight that thought because he swear that isnt it. Ive given up and just rely on my vibrator and ifbhe wants sex i just do it like i would give him a ride or make him a coffee. He is my best friend and a great partner in every other category. I won't leave and I would never cheat. Id rather a bad sex life than some of the other flaws I've seen in men and relationships so i cant even complain but I just feel alone in this sometimes and hard not to feel down on myself.

I wanted to share a few things that have been helping me juggle writing, real life, and publishing on RR without totally burning out. I'm not some big-name author, just someone who’s figuring it out day by day and I know a lot of you are doing the same.

So here’s what’s been working for me so far, in case it helps anyone else trying to find their rhythm:

**Real life always comes first, and that’s okay.**

No guilt. Life happens. Jobs, kids, health, surprise dental drama, you name it. Your story will wait. If writing needs to pause for a week (or a month), you're not failing. You're human. That’s part of why I like having a backlog (more on that below).

**I stopped pantsing everything. A loose structure helped me write faster.**

I used to write purely by vibes. But now I keep a super rough outline,  a few sentences per chapter, just so I know where I’m headed. It cut down my writing time a ton and helped avoid those “stuck staring at the screen” days.

I still let the story surprise me, but I have some road signs now. And I color-code stuff like “fight scene,” “emotional gut-punch,” or “worldbuilding moment” to make sure I’m not front-loading all my good stuff into the first 5 chapters.

**Publishing schedule = my lifeline**

I post four times a week, always on the same days/times. Readers know when to check in, and I can plan my week around it. Even better, I built a backlog so I’m not scrambling the night before. My current goal: stay 2–3 weeks ahead.

If you’re just starting, once a week is totally enough. Consistency > frequency.

**Some random hacks that work for me:**

* “Just 20 minutes” timer = usually turns into an hour
* Switching locations (even to the kitchen table) makes it feel fresh
* I reward myself with snacks, music, or TikTok scrolls after scenes
* I track my wordcount but *don’t judge it*. 200 words? That’s a win.
* Draft and format your chapters early, then upload them as “scheduled releases”y
* Use clear headers, line breaks, and spacing for mobile readability
* Royal Road readers tend to love short actiony paragraphs and dialogue-heavy scenes
* Make your fiction description feel like the first line of a trailer, not a Wikipedia entry

**Anyway. That’s my “how I’m surviving this wild RR journey” list.**

If you’ve got your own tricks, drop them below! Let’s build a little toolbox for the rest of us still stumbling toward chapter 30 with coffee in one hand and self-doubt in the other ☕️📝💀

Later this week, maybe I'll post a list of easy to cook recipes to keep yourself and your family fed while facing word count deadlines. \*grin\*

Are you following a ketogenic diet and wondering if your favorite fizzy drink fits into your low-carb lifestyle? Diet Dr Pepper has become a popular choice for those seeking a zero-calorie beverage, but determining its compatibility with the keto diet requires a closer look. Many keto dieters struggle to find satisfying drink options that won't kick them out of ketosis. In this comprehensive guide, we'll dive deep into the world of Diet Dr Pepper and explore whether this carbonated classic can be part of your ketogenic meal plan.

Understanding the Keto Diet and Beverages

The ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat eating approach that dramatically changes how your body processes nutrition. When it comes to beverages, keto dieters must be extremely careful about hidden carbohydrates and sugar content. Diet sodas present an interesting option for those craving a sweet drink without adding significant carbs to their daily intake.

Nutritional Breakdown of Diet Dr Pepper

Let's examine the key nutritional components that make Diet Dr Pepper a potential keto-friendly beverage:

• Zero Calories
• Zero Carbohydrates
• Zero Sugar
• Artificially Sweetened

These characteristics make Diet Dr Pepper an attractive option for those following a strict ketogenic diet. The absence of sugar and carbohydrates means the drink won't directly impact your body's state of ketosis.

The Role of Artificial Sweeteners in Keto

While Diet Dr Pepper contains zero carbs, the artificial sweeteners used in the beverage can be a point of contention for some keto practitioners. The primary sweeteners include:

1. Aspartame
2. Acesulfame Potassium

**Research suggests** that these sweeteners may have minimal impact on blood sugar levels, making them generally acceptable for a ketogenic diet. However, some individuals report potential insulin response or digestive issues with artificial sweeteners.

Potential Concerns for Keto Dieters

Although Diet Dr Pepper appears keto-friendly on the surface, there are some considerations:

Potential Drawbacks:
• Artificial sweeteners may cause sugar cravings
• Potential minimal impact on insulin levels
• Lack of nutritional value
• Possible digestive system disruption

Expert Recommendations for Consumption

Most keto experts suggest moderation is key. While Diet Dr Pepper can be consumed on a ketogenic diet, it shouldn't replace water or other nutrient-rich beverages. **Staying hydrated** with water should remain your primary focus.

Alternatives to Diet Dr Pepper on Keto

For those seeking variety, consider these keto-friendly beverage options:

• Water
• Unsweetened tea
• Black coffee
• Sparkling water
• Bone broth
• Electrolyte drinks with zero carbs

Scientific Perspective on Diet Sodas and Ketosis

Multiple studies have shown that zero-carb beverages like Diet Dr Pepper do not directly prevent ketosis. The absence of sugar means these drinks won't trigger an insulin response that could potentially interrupt your metabolic state.

Making an Informed Decision

When determining if Diet Dr Pepper fits your keto lifestyle, consider:
1. Your personal health goals
2. Individual metabolic response
3. Overall diet composition
4. Consultation with a nutritionist or healthcare professional

Conclusion

Diet Dr Pepper can be consumed on a ketogenic diet due to its zero-carb and zero-sugar profile. However, moderation and individual tolerance are crucial factors to consider. While the beverage won't directly disrupt ketosis, it's essential to prioritize nutrient-dense, hydrating options in your dietary approach.

**Place**: Discord  
**Event**: Session 0  
**Circumstance**: Each player (30 of them to date) arrives to the gate of the keep and announces who they are to the Gate Guard and then continues on their adventure.

**Extenuating circumstances:** Trolls brigade the lfg  subredit with multiple accounts.

Anyway... here we are in Discord chat

**This particular troll:**

>I look at the guard and lie, ""you don't know who the king's royal tax collector is?! How is it that I have to explain to a subordinate who I am?! I have to be here to oversee some sort of service to the realm and to be sure proper taxes are paid when work is paid for the day. I'd prefer to not explain who I am to every lowly gate guard.

My response:

The **Gate Guard** laughs and shouts, *""Neeeext!*

A thin bald man pulls down the hood from his black cloak. He gives you an obvious side eye and then *stomps* with his right foot, near your left.

>""I AM THE THE TAX COLLECTOR! This IMPOSTOR! SEIZE HIM AT ONCE!""

(""stay tuned"" -- busy busy dm)

\--- I was busy and it was still 4 days from actuall voice session 0.

Before we continue, it should be noted that all the other trolls, of which this guy is a member of organized group of trolls, already have heard the NO MAGIC rule of keep about 20 times.

I am sipping my morning coffee and find this in the Discord channel:

**Troll:**

>I discreetly cast disguise self with my back turned to make myself look like the bald man.

>I cast minor illusion to create a sound of someone saying ""help me! Please help me!"" Over and over, to create a distraction .

>Then I cast elementalism to beckon water on the thin bald man and then beckon earth so the dirt sticks to him.

>I use thaumaturgy to make my voice loud to yell at the guards, ""there he is! Look, his illusion to look like me is dirty, and it's fading off!"" And as I'm talking I cast elementalism to sculpt element , to shroud him in a puff of smoke that he's the one that cast magic and changed shape.

Now I came to a solution rather quickly and I enjoyed my solution.  
However I do not want to smugly brag about that solution, until, you've shared your solutions

Some information might help you in your decision making.  
A) this is player 1, invited first because they posted to LFG  
B) they were sent to gather the 5 people who responded to their LFG post

D) above them to either side is 4 men with crossbows, spears, and 2 ballista  
C) the Keep has a big no magic policy (once you get inside usually, outside it's all good, usually)

Hi!

I have a friendly cocktail competition coming up & im trying to experiment with chambord!

I was looking around the equipment we had available & made this:

45ml spiced rum 
22,5ml chambord
15ml mezcal (nuestra soledad santiago, tried del maguey, wasn’t fitting)
2dsh angostura
2dsh orange bitters
(stir)

It was lacking body, i’m thinking about doing a kind of desert twist to it.
Pastry chefs combine raspberries with chocolate/coffee, and i wanted to implement something like that here, maybe sub the mezcal for a coffee liqueur, with different measurements.

I’m thinking of infusing one of the ingredients with regular/dark chocolate, or doing a milk wash, but blending the milk with the chocolate.
I’m unsure what i should do to really make this pop, im pretty new to signature cocktails, this would literally be my second one ever, so i’d appreciate some help.

All advanced techniques are allowed! So i’d appreciate any simple or complicated advice you can give me to give this drink some depth & body :’).

I’m in my 30s, male. I’ve had eczema before & I wouldn’t say my skin was flawless, but it wasn’t as bad as it is now. 1.5 years ago, I broke out in hives, and the dermatologist diagnosed it as papular eczema. I was prescribed prednisone to take and triamcinolone acetonide cream 0.1. That resolved. 

Months later, the eczema flared back up, but it was weeping and crusty this time. Not just a tiny part of my body, but my whole back, front of body, arms, and legs. I was prescribed clobetasol 0.5 cream. I’ve been using that for one week and noticed some good results. It didn’t heal 100%, but it healed to a percentage. So, I switched to triamcinolone for maintenance because I read how potent clobetasol is. After switching to triamcinolone, the flare started back up & it seems to have gotten worse. 

I feel so down now because my skin ruined my self-confidence. I became anti-social and didn’t even want to go out. I’m trying every method I can find in this group, starting with omega-3, multivitamin supplements, and green powder. I don’t know what else to do. Maybe it’s my diet? I cut out red meat. I eat mostly rice & ground chicken/turkey. I’d have some lactose-free milk with a bowl of gluten-free Cheerios for breakfast. The usual coffee. Limited my sugar intake. 

I’m all over the place, but my main thing is that I feel so down because of my skin condition. I want to stay home all day and lay on the bed because of this. ",8,1744057865.0,eczema,3,0.91,False

Our sexual relationship is extremely one sided, and incredibly demanding. He has a good job, but is selfish and bad with money. I stay at home, for very reasonble reasons I am not willing to disclose. Reasons I am working to fix, but alas I need money to fix.  I have been struggling financially and have applied to over 10 jobs, and requested a professional license but my classes are out of state and I do not have the money to go back to school. The case is mute because again, no childcare is available. 

We have a one sided bedroom, not a dead bedroom situation here. He is not into ""female"" pleasure. He thinks female orgasms serve no purpose and he is ""icky"" about touching woman, woman nakedness and so on. Stupid because the man made me go through three plastic surgeries. Anyhow. I told him, (and I meant it) that I dont care he watches porn, is sort of a like a break for me, since every time we have sex (I mean, I perform a sexual act for him), I feel more disconnected to him than before. 

He is into heavy porn. Multiple times a day, his phone is just a never ending stream of girls dancing and crossing eyes and your typical tiktok girl. I am looking for some sexual satisfaction, I have high libido and I want to be liked and desired since I worked so damn hard on working out, running marathons, eating collagen, getting surgeries and what not. 

I am also pressed for money. I thought, maybe if I turn into some of those tiktokers, only fan woman he will actually be into me. Also, I am SUPER pressed for cash. So I did. (still working on it).

  
He goes on to show me all of this conversations he had on only fans. I was shocked. Asking them to go out for coffee, about her ""classes"". Telling her he likes nasty woman. He claims I am jealous (I am not, he has visited woman at their houses and I don't actually care). But somehow this felt like a punch in my gut because he brough up an open relationship and I said yes (maybe I was too eager) and he got absolutely ballistic about me liking other men. So I was like, okay fine, I am sorry and all those apologies that he thinks he is due. 

Should I bring up an open relationship again? He said he is fine with me doing only fans, so long as he doesn't have to see me naked. He is apparently okay with other people seeing naked (I didn't know this). I honestly have no idea if this is a relationship or am I just a service to him? 

I am crazy for thinking this is crazy? Up until know I thought I was a pretty normal woman with pretty normal sexual tastes and desires, but I cant see where this is going besides, I am very convinient to him, and he is convenient for  our family.

  This is the meme. What if a Barbarian was so mad or so dense that magic had no effect. Now some of this premise falls apart being how magic has to use the magic inherent in the person it is affecting to have some sort of affect. We see this when the elf tries to cast some damage spells. As stated here

>“Yes. I believe your assumption is correct. By the same token, that is most likely why the wave had little effect. We have already explained how magic works in the world. It interacts with one’s own magic and produces the results from that interaction. Without your own magic, the wave had nothing to harness, nothing to fix upon.”

  My question is how the hell has Brin been healing him? And how has been tracked since it can not be done magically. I think stuff like this could be interesting but the author kind of wrote themselves into a hole with this. 

  Besides that we have Gar always trying to white knight to the point you just want to smack the shit out of him. Seriously if they want to kill Gar send a shadow with some tits. He wont do anything and probably stab himself for it.

  Next the author has fallen into the trap that the best friend/ sidekick/ comedy relief just is there for gar to shit on and show how superior he is. The MC knows what Tip has gone through and even though Gar constantly tries to show concern and kindness for Brin because well...tits he constantly shits on Tip and threatens him. Stuff like that is hard for me to read....part of the reason I stopped reading Nick Nobel.

   Besides my problems there the book is well written. The author certainly has a direction he wants to go. I am happy he tied up the plot with his best friend quickly there and we can get on with the main story.  If you can get past some plot holes then it is worth the read.

  It is hard to believe but this is by the same author of The Aurora Chronicles. This....I feel this is this authors weakest series (probably sold the best though).  The books feels more like borderlands then fallout. The MC not only is unlikable but without the plot armour would be dead. hell I wanted to kill him here

>  I hurried away from Haven, ignoring all the people suddenly shouting at me. Why the fuck were they pissed? I was the only one brave enough to do anything. I wanted to call every one of them a goddamn coward. I wasn’t even a fighter and I was the only one willing to do this.

  I am just left with the feeling of because you don't know shit. You have been here days and you are trying to play fucking hero. You are going to get some of my people killed.  Much like he is told after.

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” he demanded. “We have a plan, new guy. A solid plan that works every time. We do not deviate from the plan. Is that simple enough for you to understand?”  
  
 “Tell that to the settler that got shot in the neck,” I said angrily. “Look, I’m not expecting a hero’s welcome or anything, but I just went out there and killed half of those fucking guys myself, since no one else wanted to do anything. I don’t really get why you’re being a dick to me all of a sudden.” “We have a plan!” Mayor Cameron shouted. “As soon as they get close, we set them on fire.”  
  
 “Well, maybe someone should have told me that plan,” I said back.

  Like you have been here 2 days so when would we have told you the plan. Also you have been here two days WHY would we have told you the plan. We need you to follow orders or be dead. Seriously I would not have yelled at him...he has proven to be a threat to my people that I am responsible for...he would have jumped down I would have walked up and just put a bullet in his brain. That would not have made for a very long book though.

  Then to recover from this I feel the author went and made the sheriff and mayor mustache twirling evil. It was pretty uncalled for. Really I expect better from this author.

  The MC can not take anything seriously yet wants to start his own settlement and of course by virtue of being MC he can shoulder this important task and all the logistics while his mind is 90% staring at Shaylas ass.  It feels like the author really missed out on the survival portion there does not give the sense of desperation. Of every day being a trolley problem just this MC wakes up and decides to be a Disney princess (he can do what he wants and the world will abide,) it just left me feel wanting. It just did not have gravitas, like when the MC is going through the hospital and he grabs coffee as a must have. Shure MC is new and stupid but Shayla should have set him straight but nope. It just made the book hard to get through. As I said this author is one I expect better from.

  
Death becomes Him

https://preview.redd.it/ugfp3iplqgte1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbd41e22e272e728e5c553aea3f18f26f36084c4

   I don't feel like the author could keep his story straight. I think they had a decent premise, they had a lack of world building but feel they dropped the ball with the research. Like El Paso is something like the 6th largest city in Texas and like 25th in the US I think. The author writes it like it's a podunk town in the middle of nowhere (thats Chaparral....or Socorro).  Also what it takes to be a field intern with the CDC (you have to have at least a masters in a required discipline ) and they forget what they said previously. Things like how one second Alerace was the Closest thing to familiy the MC had....then he is worried about his mother seeing his face on a milk carton plus the first time they met was when he is assinged to her and they banged.

  The ""school arc"" was just contrived and did not feel like it served any purpose except to add FMC's. The girls are pretty boring. The drama and tension was really lacking. 

  I think the book suffers really from pacing. The author tried to jam what should have been maybe 3 or 4 books into 484 pages. They should have started with some world building meeting the Dr. maybe they do some missions get familiar with each other set some tension. We meet them after their one night stand and they keep talking about shit like we the reader are supposed to know what happened. 

  Maybe set the stage on why they are trying to at NGO's in El Paso (are no NGO's out of Bliss but whatever) because that was not built up at all. There has not been cattle there since forever. I mean there is a stockyard by Redd Road but thats just to buy and ship.

  Also the author did not give us a feel for the characters at all. We really don't get any feel of them until stuff happens then the author says ohh yeah character has a background in this. Like they had to say that to fit it in. Lost of telling us and no showing us things. 

  Like I said the author would have been better served slowing the pacing down fleshing out the story and planning it out better.

  
Sin eater Book 1

  For some odd reason this authors books are controversial in this community and I can not understand why.  This book was fan fucking tastic to me. I know some said that the POV switches were hard to follow but it did not seem that way to me. The story flowed well the world building is top notch and the characters were interesting. I love how we went with Eastern European mythology here. They always make the most monstrous monsters. 

  I also like how we are getting a Christopher Nolan style we are starting the story at the end of a beginning type thing. Like we know how one ending happens and we are really looking at what comes next. If the story is on rails or if the MC can make it by the skin of his teeth.

  With this author if the MC makes it then it is earned. Much like in Sheol Saga the MC has to go through some shit. Work hard make SMART plans with the information he has....and still get kicked in the teeth. I love to see the MC have to be better because who he is going aginst is not a idiot as well. There is less punching your way out of a situation and more actual effort and I am 100% here for it. That is a really strong point in this authors favor for me is that the MC has to work for what he wants but hes not always sitting around getting his teeth kicked in.  It's a fine line and the author walks it well. 

  I am all in on this series and I can not wait for the next one.

  
Cheer Girls 

https://preview.redd.it/ptng3m74wgte1.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f8e7817dd575419875ad98a0672cf4d8e2b03cd

   It's porn. Yeah full on porn. The plot was so paper thin that it could have been a Van Dam movie.  I feel that by book 4 the author really stopped caring. The spelling went downhill, shit just started happening to pad word count. Not jus t that there was a spicy scene every like 10 pages but all the spicy scenes were the same pretty much. Like the author just cut and paste.  

  Now books 1-3 were mid to decent in quality. The author had the harem be way too large so we dont really get to know any of the girls. The girls we do get to know quickly get sidelined. It seems the author had a hard on for Hiroku for some reason. I think she would have better served the story being killed as a traitor but ohh well. 

  I do think this was a decent set up if the author expanded it and we know more of what Brandons adventures with the girls when he gets to earth. It sounds like some of the girls are leaving the harem to go back to their families. 

  This book did surprise me in one way. This was one of the first books I can recall where I thought the MC should have kept his mouth shut and not said anything.  Like when Hiroku decides 3rd wave feminisim is the life for her and starts blaming Brandon for everything he should have called her on her shit. 

 Told her hey fine I will go this way you and your people go that way and best of luck to you. And when she starts putting him on the spot about how many skills or whatever did he start with he should have been like none of your business you dont want to be on my team then you dont need to know.

  Brandon throughout the book is a simp...even when he becomes a Incubus he is still a simp.  

  Now the voice acting needs a lot of work. The mc sounds like Kasey Casem when rhey were talking. I felt like they were going to drop the latest top 100 (yes I am old go fuck yourself).  The female Va did not do much better. Outside of the quest board almost all the girls sounded the same.  I dont know if this is a early work or the Va's just phoned it in but these two usually do so so much better.  Anyway if you can get this book at a discount sure go for it but it was nothing to write home about.

  
  So this is my reads for the last two weeks. This week I am trying to get through Station Flannan (not a strong start) and The Wexton Experiement (hard for me to get around the MC being a dick so I DNF and started Station Flannan.

1jtvbdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1jtvbdv/data_science_student_looking_to_break_into/,Data Science Student Looking to Break into Alternative Assets – Need Advice on CFA vs. CAIA and Next Steps,"Hi everyone,

I’m a Canadian university student studying **Data Science**, and I’m looking for some advice on breaking into **Alternative Assets** (Private Equity / Hedge Funds). My long-term goal is to start on the **data/quant side** and eventually **transition into a more front-office, investment/investment analytics-focused role**.

# Background:

* Undergrad in Data Science (strong programming & quantitative skills)
* Minimal formal finance education, but I’m actively learning
* Passionate about finance, especially alternatives (PE, HF)
* I’ve had coffee chats with people working in data/tech roles at PE and HF firms some of them later transitioned to front-office roles (Investment + Analytics) and had both CFA and CAIA designations.
* Several recommended I pursue the **CFA** or **CAIA** depending on my time and goals

Their advice:

* **CFA** = broader foundation in finance (ideal if I have time and want to learn more generally)
* **CAIA** = more targeted to alternatives (ideal if I want something more niche and manageable over the summer)

# My current situation:

* Free from **May to August**
* Open to putting in the time to study or work on projects

# My questions:

1. Would it be worthwhile to pursue **CFA L1 or CAIA L1** this summer?
2. Also if I am studying from the CFA level 1 should I study for the CAIA L1 as well and give both of them as early as I can?
3. For someone with a **non-finance background**, how realistic is the goal of pivoting from a data role to front office in alts (5-10 years time)?
4. For an individual with minimum formal financial education how many hours would I need to put in? (\~400?)

Any advice from people who’ve made similar transitions (or are on that path) would be super helpful. Would love to hear what you would’ve done differently if you were in my shoes.

I finished watching White Lotus last night and there was an episode that really resonated with me in terms of what happened during my adulterous adventure. In summary, I attempted an affair a few months back where my AP only wanted money from me. 

For those who are following White Lotus S3E7, a character named Laurie decides to have an ONS with Aleksei. The two started sharing more intimate things with each other during the afterglow of sex, Aleksei tells Laurie about his financial struggles and begs Laurie to help his situation so he can fly his mother in from Russia. Fortunately, Laurie was able to run away when Aleksei's gf shows up unexpectedly at the apartment. 

How this feels like deja vu to me is when my AP asked me for money. I met my AP after she replied to my ad on Reddit. We probably should not have started sexting so soon before we met for coffee in retrospect but I think that was her hook. My AP proceeded to tell me things about her family and about her financial struggles. This started to feel very transactional to me so I stopped all discussions and deleted her contact.

But there’s a twist: Josephine is promised to Sir Joseph Porter, the absurdly pompous and incompetent First Lord of the Admiralty. The live orchestra, infectious songs, and charming performances make it an unmissable treat for all ages.

As Pinky moves in with Millie, their identities begin to blur, leading to a disturbing transformation. Meanwhile, the third woman, Willie (Janice Rule), a mysterious and silent artist, hovers on the periphery, her haunting murals reflecting the deeper undercurrents of the narrative. Exploring themes of identity, isolation, and the fluidity of self, “3 Women” is one of Altman’s most enigmatic yet arresting works.

* BOLD Layers is the first show together of Christine Hager-Braun and Tim Thayer. Both are Golden Belt studio artists working with color and shape yet working in different materials and meaning. Hager-Braun creates contemporary abstract fiber art from fabric and thread focusing on the themes of resilience, determination, and the importance of our emotional well-being. Thayer's message and purpose are an exploration and acknowledgment of the creative process itself and the unknown created through paint and found objects/collage.

* The years 2024 and 2025 mark the sixtieth anniversaries of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The two Acts transformed life in the United States for many marginalized individuals, including people of color, women, people with disabilities, elders, and others who had not had equal rights in the nation’s history. This legislation was the culmination of nearly a century of work by activists and advocates.

* “Cannupa Hanska Luger: Speechless” explores and amplifies the problematic colonial history and the concept of cargo cults from an Indigenous perspective.

More Info: (You'll learn this on the way through but his daughter actually made the account without his permission and embellished a few things about him...he seemed like the polar opposite of his profile.)

-at least 1-2 sentence responses if possible. No one word silliness pretty please.

-Oakley is 30 years old! And he probably wouldn't date anyone under 21 so please keep that in mind. Yall better treat this man right too or I'll be in the walls/j

-oc must have strengths and weaknesses no invincible silliness. They do not need to be stated but they need to be there

-please add a picture of your oc and a decent amount of information such as (name, age, height, sexuality, powers, etc...) any kind of humanoid oc is allowed from humans to hybrids to anthromorphic ocs

-feel free to @ me if I don't respond for an hour or so. Sometimes notifications don't show up

-do not kill anyone. That's rude. Injury is okay.

please let me know if you would like responses to look like this:

Option 1: *Oakley looks at you*

Or like this:

Option 2: *Oakley looks at (him/her/them/your ocs name)*

1jtv52m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNOLA/comments/1jtv52m/thank_you_rasknola/,Thank you r/AskNOLA!,"Want to thank all the folks on this sub as well as locals that I met on my recent trip this past week. I traveled solo as a female in my 30s. I never felt unsafe but I kept it moving on the streets and avoided Bourbon entirely as it just isn’t my vibe. Locals were very vocal in conversations with me that Bourbon St is not the place to be. Women who aren’t from here should be aware that men will try to talk to you or compliment you on the street, it was all good though kept it friendly and always minded my drinks. Good reminder that I’m found attractive in other places 😂 Food was amazing. 

I ate and drank at the following places:

Pêche - seafood platter, cocktails

Bearcat - fried chicken biscuit with crawfish gravy 

Palm and Pine - brunch the duck fat potatoes were some of the best home fries I’ve had 

The Vintage - raspberry filled and OG beignets

Ayu Bakehouse - kaya bun, boudin boy, strawberry matcha

Lagniappe Bakery - benne toffee cookie

Jewel of the South - cocktail 

Loretta’s - praline filled beignets

Cafe Du Monde - OG beignets

Central Grocery- muffuletta

Latitude 29 - tiki drinks (super strong!) I got a couple apps but admittedly prob ordered the wrong ones I didn’t think they were good

Will and the Way - good happy hour $9 cocktails, bring cash as they have a minimum on cards 

Parkway - fried shrimp

Porgy’s - crawfish boil in spicy butter, crudo

Paladar 511 - brunch crab eggs Benny

Angelo Brocato’s - got the baked alaska but prob should have just gotten gelato 

Buggin Out Boils - 2 lbs viet-cajun, delicious strawberry slushie drink

Molly’s Rise and Shine - collard greens and grits, hash brown

Erin Rose - frozen Irish coffee 

I thought The Vintage has the best beignets followed by the Cafe Du Monde at the park. Honestly Loretta’s (at the FM) was more like a croissant, kinda burnt and the oil tasted way old 

Things I saw/did: sculpture garden, Frenchman St, Magazine street, botanical garden/flower show, walked around royal street & FQ, did the Historic New Orleans Collection, Sazerac House, walked to Studio B/Marigny, walking on Julia and saw the galleries there (also went to Jammin on Julia  which happens every 1st Saturday). Next time I need to get to the WW II museum. 

I stayed at the Omni Royal. It is definitely an old hotel and the reviews aren’t wrong in that some rooms are super small. As a solo person the size wasn’t an issue but if I were with another person it would have been pretty tight. When I first arrived my room was musty and hot. Luckily they were able to make it cooler and thus it felt less musty. For a hot second I thought I might have to switch hotels. The pool was nice though. 

I used taxis to/from the airport and then buses, walking, and the street car. Be aware that public transport is slooow. Download the Le Pass app. I only used uber once when I missed the bus at a stop out by parkway and didn’t want to stand on the corner for 20 minutes. 

Finally other info I learned: don’t wear beads outside of Mardi Gras you’ll stick out like a tourist, don’t give the perfume/makeup people standing outside the doors of stores the time of day, and just keep your wits about you and you’ll be fine.

I’ve been doing a lot of reflecting lately, and I just wanted to share something that’s been making me feel really good-gratitude.

Life can be chaotic, overwhelming, and downright tough at times, but I’ve been trying to take a step back and just appreciate the little things. Whether it’s a hot cup of coffee in the morning, a good conversation with a friend, or simply having a cozy place to call home, I feel like acknowledging these small blessings has made a big difference in my mindset.

I’m also incredibly grateful for the people who’ve stuck by me through thick and thin. Their kindness and support remind me of how lucky I am, even when things aren’t perfect.

Anyone else trying to practice gratitude more often? What’s something you’re thankful for today?

1jtv2s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loveafterporn/comments/1jtv2s2/stbx_addicted_to_vr_sexchat_and_porn/,STBX addicted to VR Sex/Chat and Porn,"A few months ago my STBX blindsided me by saying he was leaving and wanted a divorce. He was cold, detached and didn't want to explain why he was leaving other than to say that we haven't had a consistent sex life the last few years (even though he hadn't initiated sex in forever and had ED issues). When I pressed him for a reason, he spent 3 days spewing excuses at me, blaming me for every problem we've ever had including that he knew I didn't love him because I closed a door too loudly or didn't make his coffee correctly all the time. We had been struggling to connect for the last few years due to his newly diagnosed autism/adhd, meltdowns  as well as a dying parent I was caring for that took most of my time and energy.  We were in marriage counseling to learn how to communicate better in a neurodivergent marriage and break the parent-child dynamic that had developed and we had been making progress. A few days before he was set to move out, I found multiple sex chats on his computer. I chose not to dig further -I think my heart and brain knew I wouldn't be able to handle the truth. When I asked him about them, he finally admitted that he had a long time porn addiction and was using his VR headset for VR porn and participating in sex/chat rooms which he also blamed on me because we hadn't had sex.  He said his addiction had caused him to seek out 'more extreme' content but didn't give details. I have found an EMDR/trauma therapist and will start EMDR therapy soon but just wanted to share my story here as I am struggling with realizing I didn't know who my husband was and didn't know he was capable of this type of betrayal. After reading the stories in this group, my heart goes out to all partners/ex-partners - this experience is more painful than losing a family member to death for me. It is incredibly difficult to let go of the guilt and I try to remind myself that none of what he said about me was true and that he was lashing out from guilt and shame. One of the last things he said was that our marriage didn't mean much to him because all he cared about was sex.",3,1744056856.0,loveafterporn,1,1.0,False
1jtv16n,https://i.redd.it/yielk2050hte1.jpeg,finally realised my 'muchness' was actually me loving myself all along…,"Don’t post often but I think writing will help me articulate how I have been feeling lately.

I’ve gone through such a special self love journey. Little did I know, was a journey Ive been subconsciously on since I think age 5/6 when I started experiencing moments where I felt like I was “too much”.

I’ve always been such a lover girl, I would smile at strangers, or hold the doors open, let my friends walk on the inside of the pavement, be the designated driver friend who’d get all the coffees, or spend hours handwriting letters to the long distance friends, gently still surprising them with dried rose petals, word searches, a good piece of news from something positive that came out that week.

I’ve always been such a ‘you wear your heart on your sleeve” kinda girl, who’s loved loudly and proudly. I simply can’t help it, despite the sadness and complexities of the very beautifully messy healing journey we all may experience.

I think I’ve spent the last 6 months truly preparing for the kind of love I always longed for. I thought I was ready to find love, especially the last few years as friends start to move onto their relationship/ family experiences - but Ive become that person, and now more than ever, I notice the self love being reflected right back from me through the people in my life.

I finally realised, that it was never really the journey of me finding the love externally. It was unlearning all the things that made me feel unloveable. I was born with inherent love, and maybe this journey of self love I chose to take, was me remembering it’s always been me <3",2,1744056748.0,selflove,1,0.67,False
1jtv0gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomsWorkingFromHome/comments/1jtv0gq/just_venting_with_ladies_who_get_it/,Just venting with ladies who get it…,"Two things can be true at the same time: I can love my child to the point that I miss him when he’s sleeping, while also being completely unhappy and grieving my old life before children. The responsibility of being a mom consumes me in ways that I never thought possible. The weight that I feel every day seems so heavy that I often say “I can’t believe more women don’t talk about this, does everyone else feel this way?” Pregnancy was one of the most tumultuous periods of my life. Not only was it a tougher pregnancy (hospitalized for high blood pressure, multiple cysts, depression, etc) but we also needed to buy a house (we were living in a one bedroom apartment at the time) and I was in charge of it all, since I’m the one who worked from home and had the flexibility. I remember thinking: “I am going to be a stronger person after this, I’m going to be 10x the person I was before”

Instead, even two years after giving birth, I’m a shell of myself. On the rare moments I can be out without my child, I do feel like my old self again. When I’m traveling for work, when I’m out with friends - the old me comes back and she’s thriving. She glows, she’s confident and happy. But then I come home, to my “new life”, and that version of me vanishes away like ghost. Mom-me comes back, and she is sad. And exhausted ALL THE TIME. And she doesn’t feel like herself. She’s frustrated often. And all she wants is feel like that sparkling person she is outside of the house, but it’s impossible. Because I’m a mom, and “mom mode” is fast paced but patient at the same time. 

Mom mode is cold coffee, kids songs in the background, and having to be completely selfless. Mom mode is watching tv 10 minutes at a time because you have to keep pausing the show. If you wanted quiet time, that’s too bad, because your kid asked you to play with him and you’ll feel guilty if you say something like “can mommy just have five minutes please?”. So you spend - what would have been - your hour lunch break playing cars and trucks and trains. Eventually, after being interrupted 25 times during the day by your child asking “snacks please” “can I watch blippi?” “Can you help me build my train set?” “I’m hungry” “i need changed” “can we go outside?”, you start to wonder what your coworkers are doing during the day and feel jealous if they don’t have the same interruptions. Eventually your husband comes home, and after working all day with a toddler, the responsibility falls on you to figure out what’s for dinner, cook it, and clean up. 

And then you get to do it all over again tomorrow.
