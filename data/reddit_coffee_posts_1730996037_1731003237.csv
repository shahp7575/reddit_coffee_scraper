1glwyoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1glwyoj/tifu_responding_to_a_facebook_post_regarding/,TIFU responding to a Facebook post regarding election night before I'd had my morning coffee.,"Needless to say I'm a democrat who did not vote from Trump so after waking up early Wednesday morning to find out who won the presidential election I saw my sister-in-law had posted that night talking about being tearful and anxious about the outcome. Since I'd just woken up I commented ""Fuuuucccckkkkkk!"" and left it at that. Later that morning I get a text from my brother asking me to delete my comment so my niece (his oldest) wouldn't see it. She has Asperger's and one of her triggers is curse words which I'm well aware of but hadn't considered that maybe my niece would see what her mom had posted with my response. So no problem, I go on Facebook to delete my comment and see that I had not in fact commented on my sister-in-law's post but on niece's. My sister-in-law and niece have first names that share three of the same letters so in my ""just woke up, hadn't had my coffee yet, and dumbstruck state"" misread the names. Needless to say I deleted my comment immediately. Hopefully she never saw my comment and has since deleted her post entirely. She's recently turned 19 so this was her first voting in a presidential election. Hope I haven't given her a new trigger regarding voting.
TLDR: Posted a comment on my autistic niece's Facebook, possibly triggering her when she was already freaking out.",1,1731003093.0,tifu,0,1.0,False

Iscream sat with their knees up to their chest in a filthy alleyway, taking what little shelter they could from the rain. They took out their phone and studied Fwench Fwys voicemail, staring down at it for what felt like an eternity before sighing and putting their phone away.

Their ears perked up when a shadow fell over them and the rain stopped falling on their head. Iscream looked up and found Lucifer standing over them with an umbrella, staring down at them with a sad frown. “I take it things didn’t go well?”

Iscreams face hardened and they snapped their head away from her. “Like you wanted.”

“You think I want you to be sad?” Lucifer grabbed Iscream and helped them up. “Forneus, I want nothing more than for you to be happy and find your soulmate. I just don’t think Arariel is it.” She tenderly cupped Iscreams cheek. “I’m glad you broke up with them.”

“We’re not broken up.” Iscream pushed Lucifer’s hand away. “We’re just… on a break.”

Disappointment flashed on Lucifer’s face. “Forneus-”

“Stop acting like dad, I’m an adult. I can make my own choices and I don’t need *you* to baby me.” Iscream said defiantly. “When we’re ready, me and Fwench Fwy will talk things out, and only then will we decide whether or not to break up. I hope you’ll accept it if we stay together, it would mean a lot to me to have my sister's support.”

Lucifer said nothing for a long time, absorbing Iscreams words. “Fine. I think this is a bad idea, and you know I’m always right, but I won’t stop you.” Lucifer conceded. “In the meantime, how about you stay with me, hm?”

Iscream looked surprised at how easy it was to convince Lucifer and a small smile grew on their lips that she accepted their choice. “I’d appreciate that.”

Lucifer wrapped her arm around Iscreams neck and pulled them into her, ruffling their head affectionately. She held the umbrella over the two of them and walked down the street.

After half an hour, the two walked into Lucifer’s hideout, an inconspicuous apartment at the far end of town, and she closed the door behind them. “Make yourself at home, you can take my bedroom if you want.” She shook water off the umbrella and put it to the side. “And you don’t have to bother with your mortal form here, even if it’s cute.” She reached out and ruffled their head again, prompting Iscream to whack their hand away in amused annoyance.

“Keep your room, I’ll just take the couch.” Iscream answered as they sat down. They took in their surroundings and a small smile grew on their lips. “I just realized, we haven’t lived together since we were kids.”

“Not due to a lack of trying, you never wanted to spend the night in the palace.” Lucifer said as she looked through a small bookshelf.

“Well, *maybe* I would’ve if it wasn’t so gaudy and bright.”

“I’m the lightbringer, how else was I supposed to decorate my palace?” Lucifer found the book she was looking for and sat down next to Iscream. “Alright, I need a fresh pair of eyes. I think my plan to lead Chikn to his ascension is flawless, but I trust that you’ll have suggestions I can implement. I also made some suggestions for what you can do to bring my plan into fruition.”

Iscreams smile disappeared and confusion spread onto their features. They looked down at the page, and saw an illustration Chikn being comforted by a cat they didn’t recognize. “I’m sorry, what?”

“We’re close, Forneus. The culmination of our rebellion is at hand, and soon, everyone will be freed from the tyranny of The Heavens.” Lucifer said with conviction. “Chikn will ascend and remember their role as the Jester, and using his powers, we will *break* our shackles.” 

Iscream recoiled in horror and it took them a moment to formulate a response. “Luci, I… I can’t help you.”

“Of course you can, don’t be nervous, I did all the heavy lifting. Just do whatever you feel comfortable doing.""

“I’m not *going* to help you.” Iscream elaborated.

Lucifer looked shocked, and perhaps a little hurt, lowering the book. She said nothing for a long moment, the two siblings staring at each other. “Fine. I can do it myself, I’ve been doing just fine on my own.” She stood up and made her way back to the bookshelf.

“No, Luci, you’re not going to make Chikn ascend. I won’t let you.” Iscream said as they stood up.

Lucifer stopped dead in her tracks. Her body stiffened, her breathing grew shallow, and anger spread over her features. “You’re not going to *let* me?”  She growled, turning and marching back to Iscream. “Who do you think you are to tell *me* what to do?""

Iscream took a step back, clearly intimidated. “I can’t let you break reality.”

“What? But it’s what we’ve always talked about! We gave up *everything* for this dream! We will finally have free will!” 

“Luci, what we did was wrong-”

“*Wrong!?* We were fighting for freedom! To have a say in our lives!” She leaned in until her and Iscreams faces were inches apart. “Did you want to spend another ten billion years living under dad and his impossible standards? Living under Heavens tyranny? To feel like you’re drowning every. Single. Day?”

“I would if I had my sister!” Iscream snapped, Lucifers face softening. “I… I *love* you, we always had each other's backs, we weathered existence together, we told eachother everything. Than… than you *left* me without a word for five billion years!” Iscream Wipped their eyes. “I know why you did it, but that doesn’t change the fact I was alone for ages. You could’ve told me!”

Lucifer looked ashamed and she turned from Iscream. “I’m sorry, Forneus. I really am. I had my reasons for not telling you, but I know it hurt you, and for that I’m sorry.” She turned back. “But please, don’t undo everything we’ve worked so hard for because you’re angry with me.”

“You’re not getting it, Luci! What we did was wrong. The Heavens were tyrannical and they needed reform, but our rebellion wasn’t the solution. It only caused more harm than good in the end.”

“We tried-”

“Then we should’ve tried harder! We should’ve avoided violence unless they used violence against us. We had to be better than them.”

“And how long would this supposed peaceful revolution taken, hm? Long enough for mortals to evolve and be crushed by the weight of The Heavens perhaps?”

“But the mortals aren’t better off because of it, are they?”

“They have more freedom than they would’ve without our rebellion.”

“But it hasn’t helped them, and your plan eont hekp them at all. They need stability in their lives, order. They’ll be miserable if you succeed.""

Lucifer stared at Iscream with an unreadable expression. “This is Arariel talking, not you.”

“It *is* me talking. I’ve changed, Luci. I’m not the same demon you knew.”

*”Change!?” Fire flared around Lucifer’s form. “You don’t *change,* you're incapable of it. You had fifteen billion years to do it and you never did! You’re the same little *imp* that I’ve always known! Stop letting Arariel think for you!”

“They’re not thinking for me.” Iscreams glare grew resolute and they stood their ground. “And I won’t let you do this… I’m sorry.”

Both siblings shared a long, pained look, realizing they were now fighting against each other. “No, I’m sorry.” 

Iscream yelped as they were forced to the ground. Looking up, they saw Lucifer’s arm was outstretched and her hand was glowing. Iscreams eyes widened when a vortex of fire began swirling around them. “W-what are you doing?”

“I’m sorry, Forneus. But I can’t let you interfere with my plan and undo all our hard work.” Lucifer could barely stand to look at Iscream. “Overlord is expecting a report from you, he’ll be furious when he learns what you’ve been up to. He’ll imprison you for the time being, but I promise, you won’t be there long enough for him to hurt you.”

*”What?”* Iscream struggled against the invisible force as the flames grew hotter. “Luci! Luci you can’t! Luci please! Just listen to me! Please!” Iscream pleaded desperately as they were consumed by flames. “Lucifer!” They got out before disappearing entirely, the flames dissipating.

Lucifer gasped and placed a hand to her mouth, falling against the coffee table. They shook violently and tears threatened to fall, staring at where Iscream had just been.

Nausea overtook her and she leaned over to retch onto the floor. When she recovered, she placed her head in her hands and shook for a long time. Eventually they braved a look back to where Iscream had once been, and briefly debated whether she should go after them.

Lucifer closed her eyes and took a deep breath. *‘No.’* She thought. *’This is the right thing to do, I’m always right.’* She stood up. *’Forneus is just confused, they’ll come around. Once they see my new order, they’ll realize how ridiculous they were being.’* 

She walked further into the house before slowly trailing off, stopping in her tracks. She stared down at the ground for about a minute. She began shaking furiously and threw the book she was still holding in anger, smashing the glass of a cupboard. Lucifer stood there in complete silence, unable to bring herself to move, left to wallow in her own self pity.",1,1731002958.0,ChiknNuggit,1,0.99,False

1glws2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1glws2v/cyberpunk_short_story_need_feedback/,Cyberpunk short story need feedback,"I’m writing up a short story for a fictional zine in a cyberpunk universe and need some feedback back 

Crash story - 76

This zine's crash story begins with an actual fucking crash! If you’re new here. Stop whatever poor life choices led you to finding this zine in a Chromer bar bathroom or pretentious uni coffee house squawking about the fight, right now! To the rest of you poor bastards I’m Crash. Stupid shit happens to me and I write it down, you read it, and I make beer money for one more night. 

I was testing out one of the new fungi-AI G.Y.P Cabs for another article on another platform. You’ve seen the ads. “The perfect melding of artificial and natural intelligence” yeah not that intelligent I was mid note take than next thing I know I’m upside down covered in safety foam that smelled like old mushroom risotto on a turnpike. Maybe there's something to be said about human error? A hopped up soccer mom drove into us like she was an anti fungal on a mission. Apparently the methodical movement of the cab was too slow for her angel to get to the big sports game on time. Her big fuck off steel pile driver of a beast was more than a match for the glorified prototype made of scop plastic and nanofab. I got the sinking feeling as I hung there. The protection foam was more for the AI than my safety but the pile driver almost split us in half and spread it to the back of the cab. 

Dizzy, pissed, and more than a little hungry as I quite like mushroom risotto I was chipped out of my hard sponge textured cocoon. By An absolute vision. I’ll admit the old saying about it’s hard on the road is true but even my maiden-less addled brain knew I was staring at some-then lovely. Almond eyes ruff... Almond eyes. Two tone Raven and white hair tied up in a warriors braid and her high naturally formed cheek bones had soot and ash etched upon them. Her EMT gear was a skintight  black bodysuit, something to keep the blood and the many small things that cant see in the blood out. Over that was a zipped up dress of heat resistant material evoking the memory of WW2 nurses. Over that was a puffy jacket and patches attached to her thighs holding the many tools of her trade. She pulled out a bigger hammer to work on the emergency foam. Of course I was robbed of my dignity in quick fashion first by gravity. She put a hammer to just the right place crumbling what was holding me up and I came down tumbling head over tea kettle of my ass onto a crash pad. Which of course I vocalize thus. “Oh my friggen ass butt!” my dignity was robbed once again by myself. Still out of it when asked my name I said Crash. Luckily you don’t have to give EMT’s your real name. She gave me a bit of side eye for it, a rarity in a time where Angle Vox, Link Sweeney, and Verizon Batunas are legal names but whatever I ran with it. Another EMT finished me up minus the loss of dignity. I was fine. With my generic barely functioning burner personal terminal out in my hand I left the accident pulling up where the hell I even was. When the back of my shirt was pulled, I spun back into almond eyes. Now a inch or two taller than me, an odd turn on but it’s mine. Her mouth pulled into a gleaming smile. The pessimist that kept me alive this long was ready for these gleaming teeth to turn to gleaming fangs. She tapped her Terminal to mine. It beeped with the completion of information transfer as she turns. Somehow elegantly on thick rubber soled shoes back to the other Emts. 

I looked at the files finding a flier with a very different EMT girl on it. The layers of her uniform had made her cute, affable. In a skin tight black dress with plunging neckline her arms adorned with stick and poke tattoos. Her monochrome hair freed down her back gyrating to a silent song. She was marriage material. It was an ad for what I was really hoping was just a club or rave called the Slaughter House. The next was a text file that stopped me cold reaffirming that I should stop writing for this rag. “ Crash Story ___ A night at the Slaughter House.” Before we progress further I would like to remind you, gentle reader. IT GET’S REALLY HARD ON THE ROAD.  
 
Ash and Coal was a small town in Illinois known for… Slaughter industry. But before that yeah, a coal mining town. With the embracing of Alchemy+’s Vat meat, The bovine plague, (editor's note: Which was totally not caused by Alchemy+ 😉) the parade of autoimmune diseases caused by the viscera runoff in the water. The town was emaciated from what my Ai-agent Bunny could pull. What a few years back was around 1800 souls had dwindled to fewer than 200. It would be another windchime of a town soon, during a bad storm you’ll hear the wind go through its bones. Unlucky for the inhabitants but lucky for me. Dying towns have one constant, an overabundance of: liquor stores, mini marts, and flop houses. I grabbed Two Insta-Hots, a tallboy, a tub of baby wipes, an a few odds an ends of personal grooming from what had been a Decker MIN-Mart you could tell from the prefab shape of the place but was now was some generic mom and pop shop. Across from that was the flop house. 


I paid 175 cred for 8hrs in what was basically a closet with a bed. After some searching I found an in room Nano-Fab recycler but it was one of the older models that could break down and assemble maybe a toothbrush. So what I was wearing was what I was wearing. Pulling out the two teal Mylar Insta-Hot bags I hit the big red buttons on the bottom and tossed them into a pillow case to cook. A d-gen trick I had picked up. Insta-hots used an Iron oxide chemical reaction to heat food. Poorly. A holdover from its ancestor the military ration, place two together at least one would be a hot meal. The bags expanded like blimps as the meal cooked. I removed the nondescript black shirt and worn jeans from the tapestry of muscles interspersed with fat patches that was my body. After that my chromed up left arm came off. Synthetic muscle fibers making gross squelching noises as pressure pins detached the assembly coming off under the shoulder. It was plugged into the wall for a quick charge as I indulged in a whore shower of baby wipes after 4 days on the road.

 My belly warmed with a bag of steaming cheeseburger Mac, the almond eyes of the EMT girl not far from my thoughts. As I ran the wipe over my armless shoulder and corresponding inner thigh I wondered if she would enjoy the menagerie of stick and poke tattoos I had as much as I like her more curated ones. Birds flying over her collarbone, the Japanese kanji for protection, healing, One more thing I can’t make out down her arm in the flier.      

I called in a rescue from the Pork Rind Express. (Editors note a truck driver last seen way back in LF 05) The promise of hot chicks in a slaughterhouse rave helped a lot. I cringed as Burton crushed another orange Dex Tablet between his teeth only because after so many ungodly hours traveling together I had just realized they were shaped like pork chops with grill marks. There was no reality where Burton didn't have the pressed pills commissioned. The Pork Rind Express flew down the empty streets of the town. With only GPS coordinates to guide us Burton checked the bowie knife he kept in his boot and I checked for the Thaler micro Uzi in the glove compartment. Just in case. 

The outside was nothing special, just another yellowing brick factory if you saw one you’ve seen them all. Around that was chaos in the form of a parking lot. How anyone was supposed to leave without causing a pile up was beyond me. Beyond Burton as well as he parked further away than the rest. 

 It was a macabre scene Inside: the youth of the town were dancing in the decayed corpse that was once its beating heart. Cherry Picker coffins that once watched over workers and the slaughtered. Was filled with the sensual movement of gogo dancers lit up by flood lights covered in viscous substances to give them color. The assembly lines that moved parts to other places were wrapped in thick body bags for makeshift bars. The tribal electronica sounded perfectly on theme blaring through the PA system that must have been an antique even in its heyday. Everything was DIY, slightly sticky, It reeked of decay, of rot not just the building or its former profession but of the town itself. This was the last generation to live here. They knew it, they couldn’t stop it. So fuck it party!

Goddamn it was beautiful!           

Burton made his way to the bar while I was drinking in the scene so I joined the killing floor moshing with the cliched disaffected youth. Making sure to throw the side of my body that was all meat at those that were flesh and blood. While my fellow chromers got a shoulder with a side of coiled Mylar. I caught a knock on my chin looking up at a monochrome woman, her skin pale as snow glowing against her black bra, panties and short, short skirt doing little to cover her fantastic ass. She raised a chainsaw over her head performing the chainsaw dance from the Texas chainsaw massacre. White feathered hair bounced as she moved. Next to a big gimp man in black vinyl cris crossing straps his pot belly sticking out between them wearing a very convincing pigs head. His own chainsaw ripping threw a cone of vat meat with a name tag that reads Farmer Vincent. 

I dont get modern art but I love references. 

The guy that knocked me was tall with puffy hair in a black vinyl boiler suit that apologized alot not noticing or not caring that we were getting pelted by bits of rubbery vat meat. I said 6 times that it was fine, then 11 times asked if he knew an EMT. Then another 6 times to get through that i didnt need an EMT, i was looking for one. Finally he put me on a path to one of the cherry pickers converted into a dancing cage. I visited one after another and got lucky, real lucky rolling up just before it touched the floor. She looked like she did in the flier sweat ran down her body making her already thin dress almost see through. I had been on the receiving end and in the path of many a substance. 

Hell I had two pork shaped Dex pills in my pocket. So I knew that her saucer eyes looking at me in pleasant recognition (a rare thing for me.) were all natural. I handed her a stack of leftover wipes. She smiled and used a few as she pulled me to some boxes used as chairs.                      

She said, “You should replace some of this mylar. It's starting to fray.”

I grunt something positive sounding, my arm isnt my favorite subject. Unlike other chromer’s that had more of a machine look to their chrome or the rich that hid it under synth skin, mine looked like a robot had been flayed alive. Mylar is shaped into muscles bulged and stretched with movement over blatters that simulated bones.  As she runs dainty calloused fingers over it seemed less disturbing than usual. 


She stopped for a moment examining some fraying Mylar. “Not a cosmetic choice.”

“What makes you say that?” I asked, she was right, I just wanted to know how.

“Stronger servos require more power. They put the big packs in the shoulders. You didnt opt for the shoulder so it is not cosmetic. If you were getting the upgrade for work or part of service it would also be a whole arm so… not elective either. 

She met the part of my arm that was flesh. I jumped a bit at the sensation. Her fingers trailed back down massaging the Mylar. It sent no signal to my brain but it was hard to look away from.

Reluctantly I answered the question she wasn't but was asking. “I.E.D. When I was young a couple blocks from my house in DC. During the 5th uprising.”

She stopped pawing my arm and put it in my lap. “Back when this place was in operation my Dad ran a Mod Parlor. We used to see one of those or hand, finger whatever at least once a week... You dont write you’re a chromer? Ive read almost every Crash story out there and not once.”


“I'm so sorry.” I get an eye roll for my usual self depreciation. “Its not sexy. Or cool looking. I didn't lose it by doing something sugoi. Or to take it to the edge. Just not that interesting.” It was also so I wouldn't be recognized as easily but mostly it was because I hated it. How do you tell a girl you just met you hate something that reminds her of her father? At the time I wasn't sure if E.M.T girl bought it and suddenly it didn't matter. An air horn went off. She grabbed me by my real wrist and we wandered off back to the killing floor. She danced close to me and I did the best to match wishing I had crushed a dex for energy. A tentative touch accelerated into an exploration of her warm natural  body minus something my real fingers glided on just underneath her breasts. I would have explored more till I noticed a patch of red on my chrome. Then the real arm, top of my head, boot, it dripped and ran crimson. My body took a step back, jaw clenched autopilot movements as my mind whirled. Dyeing town of butchers during the last days of Jamestown. Id heard about it, seen it in vids. 


She turned to me with a expression like a cat watching her prey squirm in realization of how fucked they are. I licked the red off the back of my hand…it was sweet. My sigh was in perfect timing with the shower of corn syrup and food coloring dispensed from the antique fire suppression system going back to our dance.     
       

For a brief shocked moment I thought it had all been a dream as I woke in another dingy bed, in another flop house, in another town with barely a name. Till on the pillow she had rested her head was a nano fab mushroom from the in room fabricator on top of napkin. No name, no number, no digi-ID just a peach colored kiss and “This better be a crash story.”  I woke up an hour or so before checkout hoping on the pork chop express for the rest of my journey upon reflection on said journey. 

The flier said there was a blood shower but in my…distraction I thought that was a band.

I’m the second owner of this LNIB folder.  I’ve handled it, but never carried, cut with, or sharpened it.  Smooth action, solid lockup, and beautiful factory sharp blade.  Super fidgety but just a tad too thin in the handle for my chunky hands otherwise I’d love to keep it.

This one’s pretty rare and I’m the original owner.  One of the first knives I ever bought and has been in the safe for a long time.  I must have used it, because there’s some light scratches on the blade.  Very sharp with all serrations like new, and doesn’t appear that I sharpened it. The handle and rubber insert look like new and the release functions flawlessly.  Haven’t seen many of these out there and wasn’t really sure how to price this one due to its rarity. Smooth action, solid back lock, centered, and nice ergos.  No box.

1glwp5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrumbsNewsletter/comments/1glwp5i/what_makes_a_good_cover_photo_for_your_campaign/,What makes a good cover photo for your campaign page and how can this help you generate organic traffic to your campaign?,"Here is an example of two good cover photos and titles on Indiegogo. 

https://preview.redd.it/1e43ag3vqizd1.png?width=1392&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f07f7c637ef45fe49e18b8ba1e3def4102843d4

As you can see, the title highlights the name of the product and also explains what the product does. Sometimes, campaigns will simply have the name of the product as the title, and this is not effective. Think of the title and cover photo as your ad. For people scrolling through crowdfunding platforms, this is going to be what determines if they click on your campaign or not. Also, people always complain about the lack of organic traffic on crowdfunding platforms, well this is the best way to solve it. Convince people who are on the platform that you have the coolest product there. For the pillow campaign, they didn't say something vague or simple like “comfiest pillow ever” or “super soft pillow”, they actually highlighted the unique value that it brings to customers and shows that there is a lot more to this pillow than what meets the eye. Including that it is doctor developed shows that they took a scientific and data driven approach when determining the features and materials of this pillow, really building unique value for customers. The coffee Grinista does a good job of explaining what the product does and what it is you will actually get out of your product. This is important because the name of the product “Grinista” is seemingly meaningless without the description that follows. Remember that when naming your product and creating your title, your funny or clever name is not going to help you get sales if people have no idea what your product does. This campaign clearly states what you are getting from the product and how you can use it in your daily life. It is appealing to people who make their own coffee and understand that struggle of having to buy a coffee grinder with a separate scale. 

Now for the cover photo. Both campaigns do alot more than simply showing the product. The coffee grinder goes into further detail about the dimensions and functionality of the product. Their target audience is likely people who are well versed in the coffee and coffee gadget space, therefore these words have a meaning for them. However, to the average person whos not that interested in coffee, things liker “flat burr” and “Auto Fines Knocking” have very little meaning. Therefore, they are eliminating a large potential audience by including this industry specific language. That is okay because they clearly built this product for a certain level of coffee enthusiast and want to ensure that those people love their product, not that it appeals to the everyday person. This is also good because it segments the market that they are trying to sell in. Oftentimes, it is too hard to create a product everyone will like, make one that 100 people will love and you have a winner. 

The pillows cover photo is also well put together because it highlights how the pillow helps people sleep. At the end of the day, that is the importance part. They could include the materials and the different studies they did to make the best pillow, but no one really understands that or cares. If they said the pillow is 80% cotton or whatever, the user doesn't know the difference, they likely don't even know what the pillow they use now is made out of. Instead, they highlight how this is a full body pillow and comes with components to help your whole body sleep. This is very unique and not many pillows focus on your legs, hips and arms. Typically, a pillow is for your head and thats it. Since this campaign is offering a unique product, it is important they focused on that difference as opposed to anything else. They have communicated the uniqueness of the product and that may be enough to get some organic clicks on their page. Also, including a user testimonial is a great strategy, especially in crowdfunding. People need to see that you are serious and that other people like your campaign, not just you. So often, campaigners think they came up with a good idea and are confused why no one else likes it. People on crowdfunding platforms are very moved by social proof. They like to see that other people bought the campaign already or that a friend of theirs is also supporting the campaign. The pillow campaign executed the user testimonial very well. 

User generated content is a very popular advertising strategy today both in e commerce and crowdfunding. It is very easy to show a video of a picture of one of your friends or customers enjoying your product. Social media has really increased the popularity of user generated content, so including that in your campaign as a way to build social proof is a good strategy. If you cant get a picture or video, do a testimonial like the pillow campaign did. People do actually read and respond to reviews the see of a product, so highlight your good ones.

Ever since I have had Crohn's Disease, I've relied on methylphenidate (Ritalin) along with caffeine. I know that I am fortunate to be on this medication with Crohn's.

I was put on Wellbutrin for a depressive episode and it gave me enough energy to run. But not just run - to run without Ritalin (still drinking a lot of coffee). I have been running faster too - I ran 5 miles in 45 minutes and one second. I ran a 5k in 24 minutes. And I ran a 10k in about 57 minutes. I never thought I would run with these times again. 

The fatigue has come back with a vengeance. Yesterday I could only run half a mile. 

Before Wellbutrin I took supplements and had higher levels of energy. I also followed an extremely strict diet of organic nutient dense foods. If it wasn't a super food, I didn't eat it.

I think taking supplements and being strict with food is a logical step. I'm tempted to increase Wellbutrin from 300mg to 400mg. But I know it won't last. And if anything, I should wait until I am in Calculus II so I can actually get through the hardest class in my degree.

Any advice on training would be welcome. I've never known anyone who ran with Crohn's and it seems like we can lose our ability to run",2,1731002122.0,CrohnsDisease,1,1.0,False

I've been using the K-Ultra daily since I got it back in early April this year, but when using grind settings suggested by some authors online (such as coffee chronicler) the bed tends to look slightly muddy, although the coffee still tastes great.

I'm currently using Lance Hedrick's one pour recipe (bloom 3x coffee weight for 45-60s depending on how fresh the roast is and then a single pour until the desired ratio). My drawdowns tend to be slightly longer than his suggested 1 to 2 mins (around 3mins final time for 45s bloom), but the taste is very nice still.

I know taste is king and I'm currently very happy with the brews that I've been getting, I was just worried that my unit might be slightly defective and I could be missing something.

Note: In the images below I'm using grind size 6.5 on a calibrated K-ultra (calibrated it this weekend). Also these are Hario Paper Filters (the ones from the plastic bag with the green V logo image thing, the coffee is a pulped natural processed (I think that's how you call it in english? It's not fully washed, but not honey or natural either), the roast is pretty light too, not in nordic levels, but still light.

1. White model Tesla 3 punching the left turn off the Embarcadero onto Folsom. Of course they get stuck in the intersection when the other direction (southbound) gets a green light as well as the walk signal for pedestrians. Wednesday is an office day so the crosswalk already had 3-4 people in it with southbound cars not being able to move. White Tesla driver punches it to get to the Fox Hills Plaza (Hills Brothers Coffee building) garage through a crosswalk with pedestrians.
2. Not 5 minutes later: a gray SUV/SAV Mazda (I think) heading eastbound on Folsom accelerates between Main and Spear and punches the red light. You were going so fast, myself and the other pedestrians in the crosswalk who 'WTF,'ing as well couldn't tell it was a Mazda or not. My guesstimate, you were up to 40;ish against the light. You also pulled in the same garage at Fox Hills Plaza / Hills Bros. Coffee building.

AFAIK, the only tenants in the Hills Bros Coffee building are Google, Wharton, and a Children's day care facility. That last one is key: **there are kids making their way to daycare in the neighborhood** \- along with a bunch of other people, dogs, etc. **Your need to make that 8:30 / 9:00 meeting is not more important than not hitting or killing a pedestrian.**

1glwi3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1glwi3y/dream_the_killings/,Dream - The Killings,"I have to preface this by saying I am writing this dream out as a short story, I hope that’s allowed. I’ve always had long drawn out vivid dreams, ever since I can remember really. I’ll wake up, turn over, and just continue my dream. This one took all night, I slept about 8hrs. 

It started with me (41F) as a teenager (16) living in a group home with other teens. Suddenly, a kid shows up dead. They were floating down the river in a stolen paddle boat from the local park. In the boat was their body, a dead bird, a piece of a toy, a doll head, a round silver charm that was engraved, a poem, and some candy. The kid was the son of the local baker. He was a shit kid and a total bully in school. I wasn’t surprised he turned up dead to be honest. 

The town was a sleepy town, it’s been  in 15 years since anything bad happened here. The cops were all over the case. All us kids were interviewed because we were the outcasts, the ones no one wanted. They thought one of us was the culprit due to the evidence in the boat. Of course we were suspects number 1. None of the kids in town would do this, no, they had good upstanding families, they possibly couldn’t be so corrupt to murder one of their own. 

The lead detective on the case was a fellow orphan Sasha Gray. At least she was nice and treated us like normal human children. When she was done with her questioning, she told the other detectives there was nothing here. That wouldn’t be the last time they show up. 

Due to the craziness of it all, I made a new friend in school. It was the bakers other kid, her daughter, crystal, twin to the one that was murdered. She was such a sweet girl, polar opposite of her brother. She was upset of course, he was a dick to us, but nice to “his own”. She apologized for how he treated us, but she said, deep down, she knew none of us could have done something so horrific. Her mother, when she came to pick her up, also agreed and was very nice. 

After that day, she and I became best friends, I only ever stayed at her place since we weren’t allowed to have guests at the group home. It was nice to have a friend that was girl, I lived with a bunch of boys and it was tiring at times. Always having to break up fights, ensuring they all ate enough. Our leader of the home was a drunken waste and couldn’t care less about our well being. There was a type of peace knowing I had a friend I could run to. Until that peace was shattered. 

A few weeks after the first killing, we were all playing outside when we heard the news another kid showed up dead. Same MO, boat, bird, toy, doll head, charm, poem, and candy. The only difference was, this time, it was the mayors daughter. Another local bully who terrorized us orphans and any shy quiet kid in school. 

Sasha, however, didn’t show up. We were sure this time they would come in guns blazing. A few days go by and more kids start turning up. All were local bullies, same trinkets in the boats, same river. The town was scared and baffled. Classes were cancelled, curfew was now in effect. Then, everything went quiet for a while. It was a whole month before another kid would die. Unfortunately for us, it was the local sheriffs son. 

The entire police force showed up to the house. Sasha apologized, but said she had a warrant and they needed to search our rooms. I said fine, we’re good kids, you won’t find anything. An hour later, they had our friend Eddie in cuffs. He was a collector. He loved collecting rare toys and displaying them in his room. We never looked close enough at his collection. However, the cops did, and they noticed some were missing pieces. The same pieces found on the bodies of the 7 bullies now dead. 

We watched, shocked, as they took him away kicking and screaming, adamant that he didn’t do it. Sasha was very apologetic and assured us she will do what she can to get Eddie a reduced sentence. A month goes by and his trial is finally set for a week before the 4th of July holiday. 

His trial goes by fast, jury gave their guilty verdict. We were surprised that he got life in an adult prison, he was only 15! I looked at Sasha tears in my eyes and all she could do was hang her head low, ashamed to meet our stares. She promised he would get a reduced sentence, she promised! Even though, Eddie was in jail, curfew was still in effect and would be dissolved until the 4th. 

The morning of the holiday, I grabbed my bike and road as fast as I could to Sasha’s home. I wanted to get to the bottom of why she didn’t keep her promise. I knocked, more like banged, until she opened the door, surprised to see me. I barged in past her and into her kitchen. She took out two glasses and poured us some tea. 

“I know why you’re here,” she said, “I tried to get him a smaller sentence, but the prosecutor was one of the kids uncles. There was nothing I could do.” 

I asked her if she thought Eddie did this. She told me she didn’t think he could. Especially since one of the kids was twice his size, he never could have lifted them into the boat, let alone kill them. 

I cried and cried, she held me as I finally let all the grief out. Eddie was quiet and a good kid, so what if he collected toys, he’s not a killer. Sasha handed me my tea and said to drink, it would make me feel better. I downed the whole cup. She asked me to wait here while she grabbed her stuff, she wanted to take me to get some ice cream. 

While she was gone I looked around her house. So pretty, lots of cute Knick knacks here and there. Her backyard was glorious, until I saw the Avery. At least 20 birds were inside. A feeling of dread settled in my stomach. I took a harder look at her Knick knacks. Porcelain fairies, and goblins. In one cabinet, there were small dolls, 7 missing their heads. I swiveled feeling dizzy, a bowl of candy sat on her coffee table surrounded by silver bracelets, all missing their charms. 
I fell into the table knocking the candy bowl over. I looked up to see Sasha standing over me, shaking her head before the darkness hit. 

I woke up, my hands tied, in what I think was Sasha’s bedroom. She had pulled out a tin with Polaroids, looking at them with madness in her eyes. 

“They were all kids of the people who bullied me,” she said, “when Eddie told me about the ones who were targeting you guys, I put two and two together. Their parents never learned and raised little carbon copies of themselves.” 

She smirked menacingly, “they got what their parents should have received all those years ago.”

“Why frame Eddie,” I asked, “He thought of you as a big sister, we all did. Why did you frame him?”

“Someone had to go, and even though I loved all you kids, he was always my least favorite. Taking pieces of his collection was too easy.” She got up and sat next to me, patting my leg. 

I turned away is disgust, she roughly grabbed my face and turned it towards her. 

“You kids should be fucking grateful!” She screamed, “I got rid of them for you! For all of you!” She got up to leave, but left her photos out. “I have to make an appearance at the celebration, till then sit right, until I decide what to do with you.” She left me in her room, tied up. For a cop, she wasn’t very good at keeping her victim tied securely. 

I was able to transition my arms in front of me, biting at the ropes to get them untied. Once that was done, curiosity got the best of me and I looked at her photos. They were pictures of all the victims, Sasha, however, posed with them, a sinister smile on her face, them tied up, with tears in their eyes. There were 8 photos in total. The 8th showed a young Sasha posing next to a girl I’d never seen before. Sasha looked to be about 14 in this photo. The girl, the same age, wasn’t crying. No she looked enraged tied next to Sasha. It wasn’t until I saw the blue ribbon in the girls hair that I noticed she was a girl who’s been missing for 15 years. 

This must have been Sasha first victim. I turned over the photo and there were coordinates listed in the back. I pocketed all 8 and looked for a way out of her home. I walked up to the door, intent on kicking it down when I hear a growl on the other end. I hadn’t seen a dog when I first arrived. I decided that was a bad way to go so I looked to her windows. All were barred, but loose. If I gave them a good kick, they should give way. I started pounding on them with my feet, the dog barking madly at the noise, now scratching at door trying to get in. After about 2 mins of kicking, the bars gave way and I was free. 

I ran straight to crystals house and explained everything to her mom. I showed her the photos and all types of emotions were on her face. They went from shock, to grief, to surprise, then anger. I’d never seen the look of pure unadulterated murder on someone’s face before. This must be the momma bear instinct others have spoken about. She took us straight to the sheriffs station and I explained everything that happened. 

Sasha was brought into the office. When she saw the photos on the desk, then myself, she lunged for me, but Crystals mom decked her before she could get close. The sheriff had her in cuffs and she was lead away, kicking and screaming. Come to find out, the missing girl was Crystals aunt, and the sheriffs first love. 

Crystals mom took over the group home after that. Our lead counselor was fired and sent packing. Eddie was released back to us, his sentence dropped. Crystals aunts body was exhumed from the coordinates on the back of the photo. DNA testing proved it was her body. 

As the years go by, I still think about that year when it all went to hell for a few months. Sometimes you have to sift through the shit to find the gold at the end. Crystal and I remained best friends till this day. We heard Sasha got the death penalty due to her crude mutilation of the corpse they exhumed, plus the framing, resisting arrest, and planned murders of other kids. 

We took in her birds though. They have a nice home in the Avery here at the house. A house crystal and I now run for orphaned kids. The bakery you ask? Her mom retired and sold it to Eddie. Apparently he’s an amazing cook, who knew? ",1,1731001962.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False

My self care routines usually consist of 3 parts. 

1. Affirming action. 

I’ll take some action to affirm my self actualization, my validity as a trans woman, meditation, or meditative practice.

2. Comfort. 

Usually some action that makes me comfortable, like dressing how I want, treating myself to a nice coffee, reading a book with a glass of wine under a blanket, cuddling with my dog, lighting nice smelling candles, or doing a skin care routine.

3. Physical activity. 

I have practiced martial arts for over 33 years, so I will do that, I will do a body weight work out, go for a walk with my dog, or even go out with a good friend who accepts me for who I am. 

Some of the books I read are:
Gender magic, by Rae McDaniel.
Love This Story, by the great JVN.
And Comics, comedy books, etc.

It was sort of pulse-like. I noticed my window in my living room and decided I would love to do this outside. As soon as I got to my window I realized that I was dreaming. I panicked. I remember telling myself “do not go outside. you need to get back to your body.” I think I was terrified I wouldn’t find my way back. I do not remember any “chord” that is often mentioned. I remember having to use my coffee table to pull myself back to my body. Once I was back in, I began to have sleep paralysis. I genuinely think that my brain did not process at all what was happening. To it-I was still soundly asleep. I laid there asleep with my eyes closed trying everything I could to wake up because I was TERRIFIED of what just happened. I remember repeating to myself over and over again “wake up” and trying to move every muscle in my body. I finally was able to move my neck and wake up. It was hard to keep my eyes open but I remember feeling a sense of relief when I woke up. The next morning I was super exhausted and weak-feeling.

1glwema,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/1glwema/does_anyone_else_struggle_mentally_with/,Does anyone else struggle mentally with everything it takes to stay healthy?,"I'm in my mid 40's and very focused on staying fit for my health and because I want to not look like an old unhealthy man.  I work out 4-6 times a week which generally consists of at least two days of weightlifting and two days of cardio.  I push my self reasonably hard with workouts rarely under an hour each day.  So I'm doing okay there.

  
The problem is that I'm trying to be more healthy with respect to diet and lifestyle.  About 8 years ago, I cut sodas out of my life.  I was only drinking about one a day but I thought it would be good for me.  I haven't had a sip since.  Caffeine has always had a strong high and then low effect on me so a few years back, I cut that out too.  If I drink coffee, it's decaf.  I may cheat if I'm on vacation but it's not common.  Also, I've been losing a few pounds over the last couple of months and eating only 1500 calories a day is not exactly fun.  Alcohol is tougher to deal with in the mornings so I really don't drink much at all anymore and when I do, it's almost never more than 1-3 drinks.  Now I'm starting to see I have an issue with sweets.  I can avoid them if they're not around but put a box of cookies anywhere near me and I will eat everyone then lie to your face about it.  So I'm thinking I need to cut out sweets completely to avoid these binges.

  
Does anyone else struggle with feeling like all they're doing is depriving themselves of things they want to stay healthy and to feel good?  I mean I feel better when I don't drink, eat healthy, avoid caffeine and don't binge on sweets but damn, now life is just going to work and trying to stay healthy.  It's a little exhausting.  I'm very happy in my career and with my family but the mental load of abstaining from skipping the gym and eating/drinking whatever I want is annoying.  But maybe I'm the only one.

1glwdj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1glwdj7/hey_texting_increased_the_sexting_however/,"Hey, texting increased! The sexting however....","Hey y'all, this is my first go on the merry adultery go round 'n round, up until now I've remained on the sidelines, taking notes of every type of shiny mechanical horse and which way they turn... or whatever merry go rounds have these days. To translate that god awful analogy: long time lurker, first time affair-er (AP'er? OW'er?)... hi, hello, please be gentle with me.

I need some advice, or just an outside perspective. Please excuse the horrific lack of detail, this merry go round's remaining un-painted and sadly without the cool tunes. 

Right, TLDR is at the bottom! 'Cause it's going to be a long one.

I (24F), have been seeing MM (40M) for a little over three months now (yeah, yeah, age gap and all that. I've scratched my head over it enough times that I got worried about my hair. I've read the universal pro's and con's list, I've debated with myself in any reflective surface, I'm simply too hard-headed to continue the head-scratching-hair-sacrificing hassle). 

So, he's in a long term relationship and has two young kids. It actually took a while before he admitted it also included a dusty dead bedroom, even though he was upfront about him having a relationship from the start.

Like any good old cliché, I white-knuckled my morals for as long as I could fool myself for and eventually ended up wiping the come off my chest in a very romantic (away from both houses), knees to the concrete, garage. In all fairness, I asked.

I'm single (wait, put down that pitchfork), and I'm not interested in a serious relationship, having children, or anything that requires me to share a large portion of my life, finances and time with another person. I'm a little (alright, a lot) jaded because of ...the entirety of existing, and whilst there is always a possibility that what I want I the future may change, I sincerely doubt it. Were it to happen anyway, I'll re-evaluate what I've got going on in my life and go from there.

For now, and the unforeseeable future, this whole arrangement works damn well for me. He has a whole life, that I'm not a part of, and I have the same! I get all the fun parts, he gets to be all up in my fun parts, etc. etc.

So, about the little predicament: despite living in the same ol' town, we texted, sexted, and sent photos and videos every day, all summer. Once or twice a week he'd have some odd hours over and message me to meet him on the side of some backroad, or he'd wander up through my street and come in for a cup of god awful instant coffee in the half-demolished, half-built up mess that is my house. He apparently had time, almost more so than me, even.

At first I'd assumed it was only the sexual aspect of an affair (or even a one night stand) that interested him, which would've been fine with me, but he'd start up random conversations, share fun details about life, his hobbies, anything. He started calling me babe, wishing me good morning and good night, giving me a little peck on the lips whenever he'd see me (which made cartoonish '???' pop up above my head at first) and... it was too irresistible not to get swept away in all of it. 

Predictably, I quickly matched his energy.

We kept it steady while the cold came creeping in, but.. little by little, it seemed to seep into the texts. Where he'd usually reply within minutes, messages would get left on read for a while before eventually receiving a lukewarm answer, or in some instances no reply at all. The morning willynilly videos eventually became at work selfie shots, and the nightly shower spectacles morphed into quick above the belt bare-chested fun. I wasn't complaining, I liked seeing his handsome face, but something was changing.

Anyhow, managed to meet up after I told him I wanted to suck his dick. I like doing it and a particular scenario had been driving me crazy all week, so off we went. Due to some circumstances that was the only activity possible, and I let him go home relaxed and sated while I peddled the floorboard to get to bed as quickly as possible with my trusty shoebox of fun. 

He texted me how hot it was, how much fun, etc. All was fine. Though, the plans we had to meet up later that week fell through. That was almost three weeks ago. Haven't seen the guy around since.

Which, it's not long, it happens, but it's different. Just, bear with me here, I'm trying real hard not to sound insane, I just have this Need To Know braincell that goes absolutely bonkers in this empty skull of mine every now and again.

At first, I probably couldn't have beat him off with a stick (not that I ever tried, for obvious reasons), hell, this man would send me Not Safe For Work content While He Was At Work, and now his dick seemed to have gone into hibernation. It's a great dick, alright, and I missed it. Frustration (and worry) aside, I figured  the NRE could just be wearing off and that life has this pesky knack of getting in the way of things. So, best not to pressure the poor guy, or Poor Guy Jr, and keep the light fun going.

But it never really got any better. One night, when I'd sent a sexy video (which I know for certain he would've loved) and it got left on read, the resolve shattered. I sent the mature version of 'What the fuck is up, dude' (*Everything alright over there?*) and he very predictably told me he was fine. Spoiler alert: it wasn't fine.

To summarize: life was busy, work was tense, and other things were also going Not So Amazing. I listened, he vented about life, then we turned it around where I vented about life and he listened. 

All in all, it was a good talk. 

But here's the kicker: things actually improved after that. He messaged me with more or less the same frequency as before, updated me about his day (even if it was a shitty, no good day), I saw more of his beautiful face (albeit digitally), and the good morning/good night texts popped up again. It's almost like he's treating me more like a girlfriend than an AP... if that makes sense.

So, now, the affection/attention level is back to where it'd been before, which is just lovely, but the sexual component to all of this is still... not quite there. Life's a lot right now, I get it, no problem, we'll keep it online until we're able to see each other. He still sends photos and videos, sure, but they're very tame compared to what he would send me before. Besides, he used to asks me for things. I'd send him something teasing and he'd tell me to take it off, etc. I do what he requested and we'd sext back and forth. Now he just says 'Nice' or 'So hot' and... that's it.

I'm not sure if it's stress is just kicking the hell out of his libido, if he's found another AP that's currently taking care of that need, or if there's something else going on. I don't think it's a slow fade either, we talk every day, have plans next week (nothing defined yet, but you know), but of course, I could be wrong.

Just for sexual health reasons alone I'd at the very least like to know if he has multiple parters, since I'm not trying to catch anything I don't want. But then again, I know about nearly everything going on in his life, and meeting me was already a lucky coincidence (in the wild!), so how in the fresh hell would he make the time to reel in another one in between work, family, multiple hobbies, texting me this frequently and still getting decent sleep.

Obviously if this continues I'll ask him what changed and try to have a nice conversation about it, since we both have needs that we want to get met (kind of the whole reason of the good ol' merry go round), but I figured there is no harm in having you guys give a little input. 

So, what do you think? NRE wearing off? Just the highs and lows of life? Boredom and looking onward? What colorful horse is moving down when the rest is all going up in this particular circus?

  
**TLDR:** Texting, sexting and meetups dimmed down quite a bit after three months with M41, I (24F) eventually addressed it, and it improved a bunch, except for the sexual component. Now I feel like I'm treated more like a girlfriend, instead of an AP, and it's all very peculiar. Not necessarily bad, but it still confuses me. ",0,1731001645.0,adultery,2,0.33,False

Feet dangling off the end.

My mind races and spins,

Twisting out the room and back again.

Fantasies of wonderlands where nothing makes sense—

Upside-down cake for breakfast, maybe.

I’ll walk the moon before lunch break ends,

Glide down pink rivers in a bright yellow canoe

To see what the night might lend, or undo.

Whispering meadows speak through the evening hours;

I love to sit by the riverbank,

Letting my mind stream away, free to stray.

I could listen to those stories for hours and hours.

When I care to glide through icy mountains, I do,

Riding cliff edges, soaring through clouds,

Dipping through winds, blow by blow.

Seasons fly past—where does the time go?

In my afterglow, I sip coffee and joke

With my imagination like a late-night show.

Where my dreams go, I’ll never know—

They pull me far away from home.

They pull my skin toward their depths;

I can’t ignore the gentle theft.

I live more when I’m asleep.

Dreams never speak

Unless it’s meant for me—

I decipher, decode,

And then I’m lost in mystery.

I throw out my hand for you to grasp;

Come, let’s take a trip inside my eyes,

Fall deeper in, through waves and tides,

Feel my heart race with every kiss.

Whatever you desire, wherever you may go,

Conjure up your deepest fantasies,

Pull them from the furthest depths of your mind.

Let’s fight grand battles, touch the stars,

Leap from skyscrapers, feel who we are.

There’s no limit to what we could find—

So pour it out, let me see inside.

In our dreams, nothing’s impossible,

The nights have no end,

And in our dreams, my love,

We shall never bend,

Together, in a boundless sky.

For in our dreams, we shall never die.

What am I supposed to do?,"So today we woke up around 10:30am. She had dropped off our daughter at school earlier and then went back to sleep. We cuddled a bit and she asked if I could make her some coffee. I said sure, and got dressed and went downstairs to the apartment’s computer room to make coffee. I’ve only made her coffee a few times, but I had always gotten her the Americano with some creamers and sugar packets to add if she wants. As I’m walking back, I got a text notification but ignored it since I’m holding coffee stuff.

I get back upstairs and tell her the coffee is on the counter, to coax her out of bed. She gets up, walks over, looks at it, and says “Um…is this the Americano Espresso?” I said I selected Americano like I always do. She got frustrated and said “You’ve only ever gotten me coffee ONCE before, so you should have got what I text you.” I told her I got the text on my way back and hadn’t even opened it yet, so I didn’t know. Sorry. She then said something along the lines of “Guess I’ll have to get the rest of it myself.”

Now, normally I would have said “I’ll go get some Espresso to add”, but she not only was she mean about not getting what she wanted but she didn’t even thank me. Nothing but discontent from her.

As she was getting ready to leave, I asked what’s wrong, and didn’t get a response. I said “It’s just coffee. What’s the big deal?”. No response. I told her “You know, you’re doing the thing you said ***I*** used to do that was abusive, by making a huge deal out of a tiny inconvenience. I don’t understand this.” No response. I said “*You’re being so bratty and ungrateful. I got you coffee like you asked, and because I did it ‘wrong’ you’re throwing a fit. You didn’t even THANK me.*” Finally she comes out and grabs her phone and keys and charger and “half-coffee” and turns to me and says “***Thank you for trying. I’m sorry that I said you made it wrong***.” Then she left for a moment, came back to grab one more thing, then slammed the door.

Now, I figured she was going to finish making the coffee and come back. Instead, she just never came back. After a while I got nervous (she doesn’t have a car, and clearly didn’t take mine), so I called her. No response. I text her saying I’m not sure what’s going on, but I’m here for her and so is our daughter and that I hope she’s okay. She read the message but didn’t respond.

Honestly, I have no idea what I personally did today that set this off or what…but she doesn’t EVER ignore me unless she’s about to do something drastic. Now, she is on her period, and she has lost some students lately, and the election happened, and she’s clearly stressed, so part of it I understand. The ignoring me and is extreme and too far. She’s done this kind of thing 3 times over the 7 years we’ve been together, and last time it happened she said if I ever get her to that point again, she’s leaving me even if it hurts our daughter.

That’s why I’m scared. I made her coffee incorrectly, and now she’s doing the thing she said she’d leave me if it happened again. What the hell am I supposed to do? My friends and family said it’s natural for women on their period to do (which is an absolutely shitty, useless opinion), but…I’m 90% sure this is her shutting down and preparing to leave.

When i got assigned a 6th grade class, I was even more scared. 6th grade was never on my radar as a future teacher because the curriculum seemed scary. I fortunately was blessed with a very selfless Mentor Teacher who became like a friend. It was even better because we shared so much in common, like our outgoing personalities and our love for coffee. She truly was the best and i’m even debating doing student teaching with her! The students, although sometimes they were a little rowdy they really were the best. The jokes we made, the fun we had, and the conversations we shared made this my favorite practicum experience i’ve had. The end of my time there was so sad, the students were begging us not to leave and to come back. I left the room in tears because I am going to miss them so much. I am so so grateful for all of my experiences as a teacher candidate, but this one is my favorite by far! And it makes me so excited to have a classroom full of students someday!

I didnt want to make too long a post but its going to be cause of my recent medical situation. About 4 years ago alot started happening to me and alot of ailments I have cant really be explained by docs, although some were. 4 years ago my dermatologists told me I have mild HS, a skin related auto immune disease that pretty much has ruined my life. Even though its ""mild"" form, without getting into it, it stops me from doing so much including being able to exercise like a normal person and hinders alot of day to day activity. After a failed treatment from that, I noticed a lump on my neck. It was an enlarged lymph node. Going from doctor to doctor, it was traced to my thyroid where, after a biopsy, I tested positive for thyroid cancer. Total thyroidectomy, radioactive treatment, finding the right balance of thyroid meds, blah blah, now im cancer free and my meds are the right dosage. tsh, thyoglobulin, free t3 all that stuff looks good on work ups. Ive suffered bad headaches my whole life as well and i also have a really badly hearniated disc (t6-t7) in my back that shoots down my left arm. Ok thats my history for the big stuff.

So around the time post surgery, i started getting these weeks where my chest would be tingly especially laying down and I just didnt feel like myself for the entire duration of the episode. Then a few epsidoes later I began getting a sinking feelings in my chest. It would have a slight buildup and then the drop. Feeling my radial pulse when it happened, i would feel a longer pause on a beat then a supercharged beat that would feel a bit heavier. Talking to both my primary and cardiologist, they didnt really seem to concerned. I did a halter monitor for a month, which showed a fair amount of PAC's but nothing concerning (to them) and 1 strip where they saw a supposed minor blockage (1 sample in a whole month). Again nothing concerning to professionals. I did an MRI with contrast. No cholesterol buildup or plaque and only thing remarkable was a PFO from birth. Also from about 3 years ago when i was trying a treatment for the HS, i started getting pain in my lower legs. This pain also spikes when im having one of these chest episodes. My cardiologist says my pulse in my legs feels fine. Ive also had a few sonograms of my legs and there was no restricted bloodflow. For some reason I also have hairloss on the outside of my legs when these episodes occur. Afterwards it starts to grow back, untill the next episode. My cardiologist said he couldnt explain it. :(

My primary put me on Cymbaltta (Duloxetine) bc she thought the palpatations were stemming from anxiety. They have not helped with these episodes. (Although I am in a better mood overall for someone who has all this stuff). First few weeks were a misery but Ive gotten used to the drug and now its ok, and im gonna continue taking it.

So currently I am in an episode. I cant 100% ID what sets them off but I have noticed maybe the days prior to them I arent eating the best foods especially in the sense of sugar. My A1C and bloodwork is always fine for diabetic related markers but this can be the only thing i see as a potential trigger. I dont drink coffee. I do drink diet soda and sometimes tea, but alot less caffeine then most. These are the rest of my symptoms right now and most are present when im having one of these episodes: (btw these last for a week- 2 weeks every month or 2 months)

\-Chest feels light, not painful, just slightly tingly

\- Eye sight is slighty blurry, like it takes an extra half second to focus on something after changing my view.

\- I feel a little dizzy when i walk around, like a minor vertigo like feeling. Very sluggish and lightheaded. Dont feel like im here. Dont feel normal at all.

\- I can have little breakouts of sweating even if its cool. Somewhat shorter of breath sometimes.

\- Pulse is more frequently on the tachy side, sometimes in the high 90s resting and sometimes its pronounced enough to where i can feel it.

\- I get a strange sensation on the front side of my left shoulder. Cant really describe it. Sometimes feels like its pulsating or tingling or tiny little bugs when i lay down.

\-Very Very Tired during these episodes. I can sleep 10 hours, wake up and need to go back to sleep a few hours later. Just cant stay up to save my life. I felt this way when i was off my thyroid meds during the months before the radioiodine. Same type of feeling.

\- Cold Extremities.

So yeah. Also after a shower the chest drop/ skipped beat thing is more frequent. But I havnt had an answer from any doctors. Tons of test and questions and I come to accept so many things that I have wrong but like this one is really getting to me and not a single answer. If anyone can maybe put it together I would appreciate it so much. To me it sounds heart related like a-fib or something but everything has checked out test wise. I dont mind sharing any tests if anyone wanted to look at something but I would love any sort of insight if anything sounds familiar.

Current Medications: Levothroxine, Duloxotene, Oxycodone & Lyrica (for Back only recently started), Omeprazole, Famotidine.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. :)

EDIT: Also , I do smoke. About 10 Ultralights/ day. Last episode I had whenever I would smoke I couldnt stop yawning. Dont know if thats relevant. But as it passed, so did that symptom. Very strange.",1,1731001323.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1glw3a9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1glw3a9,Storage Help? Tea Edition,"Hi lovely humans,

I’m in the process of unpacking in a new home and the thing my brain is ok with working on today is my tea/coffee set up. I would very much appreciate any ideas you storage-loving humans (in practice or in theory – lol it’s a struggle sometimes) might have for my tea conundrum. 

I’ve been pondering this for some time and I’ve yet to find a solution that works with my strong drive for high organization and the chaos that my ADHD thrives in, *and* one that works with the space I’ve got. I can’t keep it in the kitchen as unfortunately it’s super duper tiny, plus I like the ritual involved in having a designated area/station. 

I’ll address (1) my preferences/needs, (2) my former storage situation, (3) my inventory, and (4) what I’ve tried or considered doing so far. 

## (1) Preferences & Needs
- Accessibility: I’d like to move the tea up to somewhere at least hip high, as chronic pain is a bitch and so is my back injury. Bending over to get the tea/coffee/equipment from the lower shelf (see picture for reference) isn’t always in the cards, and I’m trying to make things in my life more accessible when/where I can. 
- Visibility: If I can see it, I’m more likely to use it. 
- Wall Available: I have room on the wall for some light shelving, but there won’t be room for a whole new bookshelf or anything (at least, it doesn’t seem like it currently)
- Cost: Even if your idea would be on the pricey side, I’d like to hear it, because I might be able to work something out or DIY it for less. I’m pretty handy and enjoy making things, but I don’t have wood working/carpentry tools (or skills lol) yet so I can’t build my own custom unit :((( I do have a power drill though and LOTS of drill bits so I can make holes in things if that would be sufficient! :D 

## (2) Former Storage Situation
At my old place, I used a small kitchen cart (Ikea) and put my tea in little white boxes (also Ikea), but I have a lot of tea and it’s not all stored in the same manner.  There are circular canisters from my local tea shops, traditional tea bags/boxes (which used to be in a drawer but I don’t have that space now), and then lots of bags from the Dollar Tea Club. 

I’ve attached some photos as well of what I used in my old set up, albeit in my new space. The microwave is just there temporarily while the kitchen gets sorted out. Please excuse the mess of other moving boxes and such in the background. 


## (3) Inventory
### (3a) What I need to store: 
- Large DTC bags: 5 x 8 x 0.75 inches (12.5 x 20 x 1.8 cm)
- Small DTC bags: 4 x 5 x 0.25 inches (10 x 12.5 x 0.6 cm)
- Canisters: ~2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm; I forgot to measure, sorry!)
- Tea bags: standard size; I have maybe 10 different types? 
- Coffee bean bags (rarely more than 2 small bags at a time)
### (3b) What can be stored on my lil island cart:
- Chemex pour over pot (large) (the glass thingy that looks like an hourglass with a wooden handle in the middle)
- Coffee grinder (baratza encore)
- Goose-neck kettle
- Misc paraphernalia: a few basket tea strainers, tea spoons, chemex filters, and other items that fit in a small container on the top (a smaller version of the white box in the pictures)

If I can fit mug storage into this situation, that’s great because there’s precious little cabinet space and I’ll take whatever I can get. 

## (4) What I’ve tried and/or ideas I’ve considered:
* More white boxes like I currently have
    * I dislike that it feels cluttered and is hard to keep organized, and that it still would require a lot of bending down to a height that is currently painful for me
* A giant shelf with lots of little cubbies and moving all my tea into adorably labeled tins or glass containers
    * almost certainly far above what I can manage with my budget, and I don’t really know how to scale it down; also space for said giant shelf :( 
* [Ikea Skadis pegboard](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/skadis-pegboard-black-10534375/) (or something similar)
    * I like that it’s wall mounted and keeps some space free; I like the [clear containers](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/skadis-container-with-lid-transparent-black-90569926/) as it’d be easy to see what I have :) 
    * Unfortunately, none of the mounted cups/shelves for this unit fit the DTC bags. [These ones](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/skadis-container-black-40569924/) are 3 x 3.5 x 3.25 inches (7.5 x 8.75 x 8.1 cm) :(  The clear containers linked above are 2.75 x 3.25 x 3.25 inches (6.8 x 8.1 x 8.1 cm)
    * I’d only be able to fit 3 canisters to a shelf, but that’s not my main worry. 
* I’ve also through google images at tea/coffee storage, craft storage, etc., and maybe I just haven’t used the best key search terms, but I’ve not had much luck in finding anything. 


What do y’all think, do you have any ideas for storage set ups or thoughts on anything written above? Do I need to transfer all my tea into new tins and figure something out from there? Should I go for a pegboard style set up? Have a friend hide the tea bags around the apartment and enjoy them as I find them?

I hope these are not annoying folks on this subreddit, I hate just rambling on and on about my problems. I think after this week I will start to keep these posts as private journal entries, but I at least want to see this through to next Monday. 

  
As the norm, I'm feeling pretty good today. My body feels like it's recovered from the hell I put it through Saturday and I'm really starting to look forward to the weekend. It is so damn easy to forget how much pain I was in Sunday. I have really been keeping a focus this week on my stress levels and stopping from pushing myself too far. Stress leads to poor sleep for me, and both stress and being tired lead me to binge drinking. I know I take on too much responsibility at work, and I have really been trying to limit myself wherever I can. I'm taking it easier on myself at the gym and my diet. I always push myself too much when it comes to these things, and it can really lead to more stress. Maybe I don't need to kill myself on the treadmill today or hurt something lifting weights. I don't need to obsess over every single calorie I consume. As I write this out I'm realizing where a lot of my stress is coming from every week. I'm not advocating to myself that I totally give up on healthy habits, but I need to remind myself it's okay to not push myself every single time I do something.

  
I think instead of focusing just on the past today I'm going to write about something I'm looking forward to, waking up sober and refreshed Saturday morning. I am writing it down and making a promise to myself that I am not touching a drop of alcohol just for Friday. I am looking forward to sleeping in an hour or two Saturday, waking up, and walking outside into the cold refreshing air in the backyard. I don't know about anyone else but I love the cold brisk air that starts to settle in this time of year, it's so refreshing. Waking up drunk or with a hangover I can barely even recognize the fresh air. All I can focus on is breathing and my headache. This Saturday I want to sit outside with my cup of coffee and just take in the beauty of that comes with this time of year. And hopefully if we're up for it go for a hike. I love being outside, and it is so much better when you're sober. I don't want to let myself think any further than this, for now all my focus is staying sober Friday night.

When it was my birthday she texted me on the night of my party, saying she had had a nap and now wasn’t going to bother coming. I set up three lunches with her at work in January February and March, everytime she suddenly declined on the day, without apology. There is another colleague who I stopped talking to, since she was very toxic towards me. She told the first friends’ boyfriend to contact me and harass me about why I don’t talk to her anymore. Of course I didn’t give any details or drama for them to fuel off. Now the first friend is asking me to the party and I said no as I’m scared the old toxic friend will be there and the first friend has not been a good friend to me anyway. Since I said I’m busy and can’t make it, instead of just saying oh no worries, she texts me with “how are you doing anyway? I never see you around work now and you take days to respond. That is unlike the person i know you to be. Did I upset you? I am really concerned about you”

Despite the fact the last text I got from her was 3 months ago and the last time I saw her was in September where she only wanted to see me to get gossip about my life. 


How would you respond to this painfully annoying text ? I don’t want to give them any information and want to make it clear, I don’t do parties now with them.

Anyway, she came over for coffee today and she was talking about her friends partner who has OCD, mostly around cleaning.
Then she tells me ""only thing that bothers me is my phobia... of sick"" and goes on to tell me she's had therapy for it and she quietly panics about having her grandchildren stay over incase they get ill, moves out if her husband gets sick and struggled as a mother when her daughter was young because of it. So obviously I'm mind blown that of all neighbours I could have, she's like me.

Then she tells me she's never thrown up other than once as a kid...if she's unwell with her stomach she just passes out (poor lady, that is awful).
I then thought about how she doesn't throw up and asked her... ""can you burp?""...she says ""no, never have been able to""...so I'm just in shock, because me too...I tell her it's a condition called RCPD and I only learned of it recently.

I'm just so sad on one hand to hear how much she struggles, but on the other it just feels like the universe put me here, in this house. I don't know, maybe we can support eachother?

I have been with my wife for 9 years, married for 5 years. I would describe my wife as a sloppy eater. Not trying to make fun of her, but she eats like a 5 year old. She lacks awareness of how she's eating and gets angry at me when i point out the messes she makes with food. 

I will list out some examples and history of what happens. Anytime she eats something that contains sauce, it ends up on her chin and cheek areas and she never notices it's there and will walk around like that. The sauce also ends up on her shirt and in her hair. She has long hair that lays against her chest so if sauce drips off her food it ends up in her hair very easily. Again she never notices the messes on her. A lot of times we both eat meals on the couch in front of the TV and most of the time small scraps of food will get on the couch or on the floor in front of the couch. She has a problem of not eating over her plate so the food easily drips onto her shirt, couch, or the floor. When i eat on the couch i pull the coffee table toward the couch so i can set my plate on it and i lean forward eating over my plate that's sitting on the coffee table. That way if food does spill it gets back onto the plate or the coffee table. This sloppy eating of hers carries over to restaurants, family and friend events. It does get embarrassing at times.

Over the last month or so we've both been eating a lot of queso cheese dip. As she's eating there are small bits of cheese dip that drip onto our couch. It's white queso so it looks like we have cum stains on our brown couch.   It's now to the point where I'm embarrassed to have people over cause they might think we have reckless sex on the couch and get cum on it. Everytime she makes a mess she of course does not realize it. Everytime i point this out she snaps at me stating i am lecturing her. When i do point out the messes she makes i always advise that she needs to eat over her plate to prevent messes from happening so of course she points out i'm lecturing her. This snapping at me has been going on the entire nine years i've known her. I ask her why she gets so defensive about it and she says it's because i sound like her parents getting onto her. When i do get onto her about the messes i dont' yell or scream, but i do use a stern dad sounding voice. I use this stern voice to express   my frustration. I'm not going to speak happily to her while she makes these messes. 

I'm getting tired of seeing no improvement on this, seeing our couch getting ruined, tired of her snappy attitude when i point this out. I always have to vacuum her crumbs off the couch because she does not want to clean up her crumbs after she's done eating. She says she will clean the crumbs off later in the day. I believe the crumbs should be cleaned off right away after eating so we don't get ants or mice in the house. When we're at a restaurant with her mom her mom will point out the food mess on her face and actually grab a napkin to wipe her face. That is a very cringey thing watching a 37 year old woman getting her face wiped off by her own mother. Makes her look so childish. I know we all occasionally get some food on our face or on the floor, but with my wife it's like this almost everytime she eats. She has awareness on everything else in life, but with eating she turns into a 5 year old with no awareness of the messes she's making. I really don't think she's on the spectrum, but i can't figure out what her deal is. It was never enough of a dealbreaker for me to end things with her in the beginning, but now with our couch getting ruined i'm starting to lose some respect for her as she doesn't seem to care about respecting the nice expensive couch we own. It's not so much about the sloppy eating but her bad attitude towards me when i point these things out and her lack of awareness. This has become a real marital issue that needs to be rectified. 

  
Is there anyway special words or phrases that i can use that gets her to see my point and get her in gear to take better care of her eating etiquette? Hopefully i described this situation with good detail. I'm happy to provide more detail if needed. Is there a way to express my frustration without sounding stern? But i feel in order to express my frustration a stern sounding voice is needed. I feel as long as i'm not yelling or screaming it's not mis-treating her. She probably does feel embarrassed hearing her husband trying to teach her better eating etiquette because this is something you only hear when you're a small child.



TLDR; Wife is a sloppy eater and does not realize she's making a mess. How can i effectively get though to her so she can better take care of herself?

1glvw2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/maleinfertility/comments/1glvw2s/35_m_29f_major_lifestyle_changes_need_advice_and/,35 m 29f major lifestyle changes need advice and encouragement please!!,"Hi update from a few weeks ago. Saw fertility specialist today with my fiancé. I am 35 had been a chronic marijuana user off and mostly on for years. Vaping usually. Healthy overall, gym five days a week play hockey, walk and hike. Try to eat reasonably healthy as well. Healthy weight. 

Have been trying with fiancé for most of this year to get pregnant with no luck so far. 

Had a sperm analysis take home kit from Walmart in June. Only measured numbers which was in ""normal range"" which I believe was above 15 million per ml. 

Recently did a second more detailed analysis from a lab through her family doctor as I do not have one. Doctor called a few weeks back and didn't get into specifics but said low ish count, slow motility and some abnormal morphology. Advised us to fertility specialist. We had appt with her today. 

She said my sperm was 10 million which is low but not super low as she measured 20 million typically, said my motility was 10 percent when normal is 50 and some abnormal sperm but didn't have a percentage. 

I told her we had only abstained for 12 hours unfortunately as we were intimate the night before my SA (dumb I know). She said it could have effected the results for sure. 

My partner and I have been having sex a tonnn over the last year. Usually daily sometimes twice a day on high days for her and might take 1-2 off days a week. She said every second day is better as it gives me time to recoup. 

Since my not great SA 2.5 weeks ago I have been researching nonstop. My changes are as follows: I completely went cold Turkey on marijuana and have had none and will continue this. Limiting all alcohol even though I'm not a big drinker. 
Started taking coq10, vitamins e and c, b6 and b12, zinc, selenium, a daily multi, fish oil, and today I just bought some ashwaganda. Also limiting caffeine but not fully cutting it out as I am a shift worker and it's difficult for me. Trying to drink more green tea than just coffee. 

The fertility specialist basically said we have some investigating to do but didn't sound too pessimistic. She recommended a procedure involving dye for my partner to check her tubes or flush them I think in the next couple months. And more blood work for us both. But basically recommended me take another SA soon after abstaining for 3 days and not 12 hours.

I am just looking for advice. Now that I have more information on my numbers, I am a bit worried about my motility. Hopefully my lifestyle changes and a longer abstinence period can help. 

 It was difficult for me to go weed free as it's helped my anxiety for years but it's a very small price to pay if it can help my numbers, especially motility. My parents are both in their 70s and I really want them to be able to see their grandkids. 
Thanks for listening to my long winded post, greatly appreciated. ",0,1731000447.0,maleinfertility,2,0.5,False

 back in 2022 I had three surgeries that are called brachial thermoplasty. what it is during the surgery is you're asleep and they use this probe in your upper Airways and what it does is it burns away the inflamed bit of that airway it's probe that's about the temperature of a hot cup of coffee and it's three surgeries. they do the right side first then the left side then the middle there's a month in between each surgery. 2 weeks after the surgery is when the coughing and the inability to breathe stops so for two weeks you're sitting there coughing wheezing everything feels like an asthma attack it's horrible just horrible you can't go to work you can barely get out of bed. but once it stops you're good. 

 what it does is it's designed to get you off a lot of medications and it does one month after I finish all three surgeries I stopped taking prednisone not by myself my doctor told me to stop. I've been on Prednisone every day for 10 years every day! I won't tell you what the dangers of Prednisone are but if you're on it go look it up it's a lifesaver but it's also a very dangerous drug. I'm in Canada so I didn't have to pay for it and the UK NHS covers it in the US I've heard it cost anywhere between 1500 to 4500 and a lot of insurance companies cover it as it gets them off medication that they've been paying for for years. 

 well it's not a cure for asthma as nothing is but my God doesn't help I used to go through a blue rescue inhaler every two weeks because I needed it I couldn't leave the house without one maybe two cuz I'd lose one now a days two years later I don't even know where they are they're probably in my bedside drawer but I don't know for sure. I still take medication like montelukast symbicort Advair and I have my rescue inhalers but I don't use them it's been a huge transformation in my life I went from having an attack once or twice a day to maybe maybe once a month. I haven't been in the hospital for an attack since the surgeries I used to go at least three or four times a year to get steroids and get myself breathing again. I'm sure many of you know that feeling in the hospital. 

 if you have any questions about it feel free to DM me or obviously comment on the post but let me tell you this surgery has been a lifesaver.",1,1731000010.0,Asthma,0,1.0,False

We met during a rock climbing demo outside the city. She had taken 2 trains and a bus to attend. I gave her a ride home that day.

We've been friends a few years now, we've met up for climbing, and also just for coffee or a museum, mostly these meetups did not involve driving.

The problem: if/when we meet up to climb, the obvious mode of transport would be me driving. I don't mind, and I never ask for gas or toll money. I really don't care about that. Picking her up and dropping her door-to-door is the problem. Although we live in the same city, due to traffic, it adds about 1 -2, and could even be 3 hours to my end of the trip if I do this. 

Her area is a very high crime area with a lot of traffic congestion. I am uncomfortable driving around there, and also don't enjoy adding 1-2 hours onto the trip.

Is it reasonable to ask her to meet me someplace closer for an outing?

I’ve been diving into my latest slime stash, and I can’t wait to share my thoughts with you all! I’ll post a few photos here, but if you want close-ups of the add-ins or videos of me actually playing with the slimes, be sure to check out my Instagram ([emoslimeco](https://www.instagram.com/emoslimeco/)) or TikTok ([emo.slimes3](https://www.tiktok.com/@emo.slimes3)).

I call these ""highlights"" instead of reviews because I like to focus on what makes each slime fun and unique. If there’s ever a real issue—like a slime that won’t reactivate or has a strange smell—I’ll mention it, though that’s super rare.

These slimes had been sitting for a while before I finally got to them, so they needed a little extra activation. Just a heads up that there might be a slight texture difference compared to when they’re brand new.

Now, let’s dive in and see what this batch has to offer!

# Slime Senpai

https://preview.redd.it/nw3ege5xr3zd1.jpg?width=2591&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=699d406785c9d58d77056bec46568d77ea7bf5e0

One of my favorite things about Slime Senpai is all the extras they send.  This extra was a very fun to play with slime called Pumpkin Patch.  I think it smells like a Pumpkin Chai tea with a bit of a leafy note.  **Generosity/10**

https://preview.redd.it/3khsq7yhbizd1.jpg?width=2888&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fbf28cfa3441be6829754d00652c7d4fe9503ec

Okay, what is up with this croissant on Croissants and Coffee?  It looks frickin' real.  Also, the little latte art cup was adorable.  It whipped up into a nice butter slime that smelled like instant coffee and maple syrup. **Breakfast/10.**

https://preview.redd.it/c4vqgq3ydizd1.jpg?width=2857&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6dba373c328751d7b11cd3d019fe5d4fc707551

I don't know why I love plastic ice cubes in slime, but I do.  These were good sized one in Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew, too.  All of the little toppings/add-ins are the best.  Mini things are so much fun.  It was a nice white glue slime. I'll describe the smell, and just trust me: spicy coffee with buttered popcorn.  I unfortunately didn't get much pumpkin from it, and I love pumpkin.  **Venti-sized Cold Brew, to-go!/10**

# Slimey Pallets

Okay, this DIY Axolotl Tank was so much fun to put together.  The slime is a lot clearer than it is in the picture.  It's my phone's camera.  One day, I'm going to move to my DSLR.... ANYWAY, the tank was literally the perfect size for the amount of slime I got, which was cool.  There's no scent, but that would've cloudied the slime, anyway.  I have videos on my social media both putting it together and destroying it! **Destroy/10**

https://preview.redd.it/0egys1z5fizd1.jpg?width=2547&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2a7178cbd7d8b439df7f22957487940bd790e4c8

Okay, I got Neapolitan Ice Cream because it's my favorite ice cream.  Honestly, they really *nailed* that scent.  It's crazy.  This is a bit of a simpler slime than I usually buy.  I like complicated slime with lots of bits, but I'd never tried foam in slime yet, so I picked it anyway.  It definitely was fun to play with, and the foam would occasionally make this weird but satisfying noise I can't explain.  **1 Gallon of Ice Cream/10.**

Both of these are really cool shops that I have bought from before, so I'm not surprised.  I totally recommend both.

So, randomly, I have 35 slimes filmed/photographed with 15 waiting to be filmed and more than 20 on the way, so I have to start posting them a lot faster.  I typically wait until I've got two shops worth of highlights before I post here to not crowd it too much, but instead of putting 1 highlight out a day, I'm bumping it up to 2.  Since I usually buy at least 2-3 slimes (much more in some cases) from each shop, the most I should be posting here is with at least one day between.  I hope that is okay with everyone, but if you ever think I'm posting too much, let me know!  I know it can be a lot with my name at the top of the sub all the time.",1,1730999385.0,Slime,0,1.0,False

I know. Be kind, please. When I hurt my back (ya gotta squish that plunger down pretty hard), the thought of an espresso machine really sounded great, and still does. Before I found this group, I didn't realize people were so dedicated to espresso that it wasn't unreasonable to spend as much on machines, grinders, coffee, etc., as one might spend on an inexpensive car. My little plastic Areopress gets the job done, but I am thinking about gifting myself a Bambino Plus for Christmas this year. Reasons for putting this off have been $ and space -and I'm not going to lie, the little Areopress, while simplistic, is convenient, easy to use and clean, and it takes up no space. It's just me, so I don't need a huge machine on my little kitchen counter. I have yet to find a nice ""mini"" sized espresso machine that's not total crap and a waste of money. I know, I am using an Areopress and there's only one direction to go from here and everyone will agree that direction is up! I don't want to waste money on something meh. By December I might be able to justify $500 range.

I moved here for grad school four years ago and have a decent network of friends and acquaintances. I now have a significant, career-changing opportunity in San Diego and need to decide whether to move. The opportunity is substantial, even after adjusting for the cost of living, but it would require a long-term commitment, so I can’t easily move again if it’s not a fit.

I have a good number of friends in Austin, but I’ve never been great at making new friends. Most of my current friendships are from grad school two years ago, and I know making friends in your mid-30s can be harder. I worry about moving somewhere new and becoming lonely, which has been an issue for me in the past. While I don’t mind doing things on my own sometimes, I’m definitely happier with a busy social calendar.

I have mixed feelings about San Diego. I don’t know anyone there, and I’m not sure it’s quite my vibe. I just spent a week there and was a bit underwhelmed—it felt kind of sleepy and lacked the energy Austin has. It’s so spread out, and you have to drive everywhere. North Park is supposedly trendy and walkable, but it didn’t compare to Austin or other cities in terms of food, gyms, coffee shops, or overall vibe. Other than the weather and the beach, SD just felt suburban and a bit boring. 

Most of my favorite activities are outdoor-related—I love running, cycling, hiking, and mountaineering—which is one area where CA clearly has Austin beat. That said, San Diego is more of a surf town. Surfing sounds fun, but it’s never really called to me. I feel more drawn to mountains and forests, like in NorCal or the PNW (minus the weather, of course 🙄).

As a single guy, I also have to consider dating. Intelligence and ambition is a top priority in a partner, and after spending a month in SF and going on several dates, I was really impressed by the quality of people I met there. My experience in SD is more limited, but I question whether I’d find the same kind of connections there.

It will be a short one with coffee and donuts afterward.

It would mean a lot to Austin's family and friends who will be there to have a strong showing of people who support safer biking and walking from across the city.

**Time:** 10am – 11am  
**Location:** Intersection of Brookline Blvd and Pioneer Ave.  
**RSVP**: [Facebook Event Link](https://www.facebook.com/events/573840405178848/)

The casual, no-drop ride will go rain or shine, starting and ending at Austin’s memorial at the intersection of Brookline Boulevard and Pioneer Avenue. The short loop will go down Brookline Boulevard and turn right on Queensboro Avenue, then back up Berkshire Avenue to loop back onto Pioneer.

All riders and families welcome!

Attendees are encouraged to bring flowers for Austin's memorial.

As of right now it's making some of the worst shots imaginable...and i understand why.  But just wanted some advice on how i can make a better morning espresso.

I pulled 2 shots today, one was super under extracted and so sour it made me pucker,  The second shot was still pretty under extracted and sour but not as bad...roughly 20 sec pull time.  I think the issue is mostly that grind size is too fine.

Here's my limitations.

Grind size is locked, its pretty fine, unsure brand of grinder

no scales to measure anything

spouted portafilters so hard to tell if theres channeling going on, but pretty sure there is.

no puck prep tools, all we get is a tamper

beans are bulk bought beans, prob not that fresh

While i  dont expect to make anything amazing, this is my only access to coffee in the morning before i get my own machine.  I've already ordered it but it'll be about a week before it gets here.  I have been thinking about bringing in my WDT tool in as the grinds are super clumpy and it's hard to get an even tamp.  Unsure how much that will help though.

Any advice would be great, but even if you dont have advice i'd love to know if anyone has had experience with this machine before.

1. My partner and I recently started a passion project by purchasing an expensive coffee machine. We live in a developing country, and quality coffee shops are rare.
2. We have no prior experience making coffee, though we both enjoy drinking it.
3. We’ve hired a barista, but they won’t start for another 4 weeks. Until then, we need to cover some shifts ourselves to avoid losses.
4. Our main challenges:
   * Learning the basics of making quality coffee.
   * Calibrating the grinder correctly.
   * Avoiding mistakes that could damage our equipment.
5. Most resources I’ve found focus only on recipes, not the practical *how-to* of running a machine smoothly.

Could anyone share practical advice, online resources, or step-by-step guides for absolute beginners? Any tips for calibrating grinders or practicing without risk would be amazing!

Thanks in advance! ☕

Hey!

So I’m 25, maginoo with a sense of humor, can do kanal humor but can also be classy with style.

Physically fit (hoping for more workouts soon!), Hindi nonchalant and curious 

Willing to listen to your stories 
 
And Travel

About you:

Hindi boring kausap, good at convos, machika, physically fit and confident

ALSO - “with a good sense of humor” ;)

In my case, I am searching for friendship and more.

Imagine us sipping coffee with style and sharing jokes or pondering along something meaningful. 

If it’s something about your work stories, political issues, interesting facts memes, online games, procastination, mga naging broken pero nagmahal pa din kind of stuff, then consider me open for that.

Leave me a message or maybe an intro if you’re interested.

See yah!

Meeting for coffee instead of planned dinner date. Need advice on not overwhelming her.

I (24M) recently started talking to this girl (24F) and things were going well. We've been meeting 3-4 times a week for the past three weeks, having great conversations and she showed interest in me because we flirted a lot. Four days ago, I confessed my feelings and we decided to start dating officially. We hugged and kissed, and everything seemed perfect.

On Monday, she told me about her morning at work and I brought her food for lunch (not a first time). She texted back saying the food was good. Like usual, she stopped texting because she was at work, and I normally don't text her during work because I don't want to bother her when she's working. After finishing work, she reached out and I asked about her work. She said she was fine. I asked if everything was okay because I remembered that morning she said she would have good news from her manager, so she would definitely tell me after work. I told her she could tell me when she felt comfortable. Because I needed to get back to work, I said I'd text her when I finished and she said okay. After finishing, I tried to call, but she didn't answer. I asked if everything was okay and she texted saying she needs space and told me not to overthink it. I respected that and told her I understand she needs space and to text me when she's comfortable. Respecting her space, I stopped texting.

Yesterday, she texted me saying she wants to meet for coffee this Friday or Saturday. I had already made dinner reservations for Saturday (was planning our first official date, which she had agreed to), but when I mentioned it, she asked me to cancel it. She agreed to meet Friday instead and said she'll text me later about it.

Important context: I learned from her best friend that she's never dated anyone before. I'm worried I might have overwhelmed her by moving too fast (daily texts, frequent meetings, physical intimacy right after becoming official).

Questions:
1. How should I approach our meeting on Friday?
2. How can I better pace things considering this is her first relationship?
3. Am I overthinking this or are these normal first-relationship anxieties?

Any advice would be appreciated, especially from those who've dated someone with no prior relationship experience.",2,1730998091.0,AskMenAdvice,8,1.0,False

My performance in school has been slowly declining, and my attention has been horrible. I've always had some symptoms, but starting a couple of years ago they have been getting so much worse. 

  I physically can't force myself to do school unless I don't have enough days to get it done and I have such a hard time doing it even when I know I need to. I literally can't sit still for more than 3 seconds, which can be really distracting for people around me. It feels so stupid that I can't write a 200-word discussion board post until the day it's due, but I can write over that amount of lines in code of a programming language I decided to learn that day, and then go and edit a video for hours without eating or drinking. 

  Coffee has literally no effect on me, and I drink it almost every day pretending it's gonna work this time. It's been making me so angry, and I don't know how to talk to my parents about it. I'm literally supposed to be doing homework right now, but instead, I'm on Reddit writing a more than 200-word ""discussion board"" because I am actually interested in it. 

  For a while, I thought that my parents wouldn't want me to get a diagnosis because we wouldn't have the money, but just recently I looked up our insurance and it said they cover adhd diagnoses. My parents have been complaining about my inability to remember things, and my mom especially has been really disappointed with how I have been doing in school versus how much I play video games. 

  I don't know what to do. I really just need someone to help me with this since I have been thinking about it for over a year, and it's been getting worse and worse, and at this point, I think I need a diagnosis.

SW: 177 CW: 174 GW: 140 

I’ve had little to no side effects. I’ve taken everything with a meal, and I have spaced the medications out by 30min - 1hr and have not taken any together at one time. 
When dosages increased, I staggered them so I didn’t overload myself. I increased one on the first day, and the other on the next. 

The bupropion was probably the most noticeable, as most anti depressants have significant side effects. I had high energy, high anxiety, and felt like I was on adderall. I almost wish that lasted longer 😂. However, I have gone from 2-3 cups of coffee a day + a Celsius, to one cup of coffee and a bai juice. I almost wonder if I had mild depression before, because I am way more motivated for day to day things than previous. 

I’ve had little to no side effects with the naltrexone and I actually don’t even notice it doing anything. I am not turned off to alcohol or smoking, but I consciously don’t drink, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on the weekend at most, because it’s not good while taking this much medication nor is it good for weight loss. 

Metformin I had slight diarrhea for a few days, and that turned into constipation but it resolved itself after a few days. I waited an additional week to start the metformin, just because I did not want to overload my system with this much medication. I only did 1 week of it before increasing to the full dosage, and have felt no difference or increased side effects. 

I work out 2-3 times a week and generally am conscious about what I put in my body. However, as far as appetite suppression goes, I was expecting it to be more. My appetite can be a BEAST. I am definitely more controlled, but I thought I would be less hungry in general or “turned off” to food like some people say they have. I hope it continues to build as I take this medication. I reached out to the care team and they said it could take 2 months to have full effects of everything. I also metabolize things incredibly fast which is most likely why I don’t feel overly different. 

Does anyone else feel this way? I plan to finish out the medication regardless because I paid for it, just hoping more appetite suppression kicks in soon as I know that is the cause of the plateau on my weight loss journey. ",1,1730997915.0,HersWeightloss,0,1.0,False

(In my country we only have Ritalin and Concerta) I made the decision to detox from everything else before starting Concerta, which I did. During the first week, the 18mg concerta dose made me so tired that it almost knocked me out — I felt like my body was telling me, ""This is how tired you are."" For the first time in years, I actually got some good sleep.

The main problem, though, is that I don’t feel as creative or energized as I used to. My mind is quieter, and everything feels slower. I don’t have any anxiety anymore, but I feel a bit socially robotic, floaty, ""zombie term"" (but I don't know it it's actually that) and not as sharp as before, really don't want to go back on tobaco usage, I thankfully don't have crawings as a regular person, used it more for energy benefits, just looking out for my health currently.

I wasn’t sure where to post this, I’m considering it more of a vent of emotion than anything else. (Plus I live in Worcester)

As the title spoils, I consider myself lonely, I am a current student of the university, I have joined societies, I go out and about everyday, (not out drinking) I consider myself a social able guy, might not initiate conversations but I can and will carry them on.

Anyway, yeah I just feel lonely, my phone is dry, my ability to do anything with other people is dry, walks around the river or a trip into town is all done alone, I think what I’m missing is someone to share these moments with and someone to want to join in on these everyday activities. That is the issue I find, someone who wants to spend time with me or someone who will message first and say let’s do this, I’ve always felt like the initiator, like I’m forcing everyone else to do something with me, it makes it out like a chore to spend time with me. 

I have had unfortunate relationships in the past and maybe I’m just out of practice on what attracts someone nowadays, but I think maybe those people are not suitable anyway, so I find myself in a conundrum. I believe in fate and I’m not the typa guy to prod someone who don’t want to spend time or make the effort, I will just leave it, so it creates this feeling of what I’ve shared. 

I don’t drink, I don’t enjoy going out drinking wise, never been my thing, I don’t have social media, so again I think these are things that are the norm nowadays, and so I feel left out and a bit hopeless. You can’t meet someone from going into town everyday, I know life isn’t presented like a Disney film, someone that will come and sit on the same bench as me or drop a book or a coffee over me, how I met your mother type situation. 

Again not much to this, but is a vent and I’m curious as to what people say, advice wise and if it’s a shared issue. 


Edit: 
I have made friends on my course but they all commute, so again feel left out, I do not have any pictures of myself so tinder is not the best option and I wouldn’t say I’m a conventionally attractive man, I’m okay but plus it’s quite a strange place.

This has been something I’ve struggled with throughout my life tbf, school days were the same, I would be by myself in lessons, lunch and home time, previous relationships have been the most enjoyable part of my life cause it has had the feel of shared enjoyment together rather than alone, but that seems so far off reality nowadays.

Saw Fertility specialist today and need advice please!!,"Hi update from a few weeks ago. Saw fertility specialist today with my fiancé. I am 35 had been a chronic marijuana user off and mostly on for years. Vaping usually. Healthy overall, gym five days a week play hockey, walk and hike. Try to eat reasonably healthy as well. Healthy weight. 

Have been trying with fiancé for most of this year to get pregnant with no luck so far. 

Had a sperm analysis take home kit from Walmart in June. Only measured numbers which was in ""normal range"" which I believe was above 15 million per ml. 

Recently did a second more detailed analysis from a lab through her family doctor as I do not have one. Doctor called a few weeks back and didn't get into specifics but said low ish count, slow motility and some abnormal morphology. Advised us to fertility specialist. We had appt with her today. 

She said my sperm was 10 million which is low but not super low as she measured 20 million typically, said my motility was 10 percent when normal is 50 and some abnormal sperm but didn't have a percentage. 

I told her we had only abstained for 12 hours unfortunately as we were intimate the night before my SA (dumb I know). She said it could have effected the results for sure. 

My partner and I have been having sex a tonnn over the last year. Usually daily sometimes twice a day on high days for her and might take 1-2 off days a week. She said every second day is better as it gives me time to recoup. 

Since my not great SA 2.5 weeks ago I have been researching nonstop. My changes are as follows: I completely went cold Turkey on marijuana and have had none and will continue this. Limiting all alcohol even though I'm not a big drinker. 
Started taking coq10, vitamins e and c, b6 and b12, zinc, selenium, a daily multi, fish oil, and today I just bought some ashwaganda. Also limiting caffeine but not fully cutting it out as I am a shift worker and it's difficult for me. Trying to drink more green tea than just coffee. 

The fertility specialist basically said we have some investigating to do but didn't sound too pessimistic. She recommended a procedure involving dye for my partner to check her tubes or flush them I think in the next couple months. And more blood work for us both. But basically recommended me take another SA soon after abstaining for 3 days and not 12 hours.

I am just looking for advice. Now that I have more information on my numbers, I am a bit worried about my motility. Hopefully my lifestyle changes and a longer abstinence period can help. 

 It was difficult for me to go weed free as it's helped my anxiety for years but it's a very small price to pay if it can help my numbers, especially motility. My parents are both in their 70s and I really want them to be able to see their grandkids.

I wanted to share some of my personal favorite spots in Bangalore that often go unnoticed. Whether you're new to the city or a local like me, there's always something new to discover here.

1. **The Street Art Alley in Basavanagudi** – A tiny lane covered in murals and graffiti, perfect for photos and a quick artistic escape.
2. **Cubbon Park’s Secret Corners** – Everyone knows Cubbon Park, but have you tried the secluded picnic spots near the bamboo grove? It’s so peaceful and feels like a mini retreat in the city!
3. **Early Morning Breakfast Joints** – For those early risers, hitting up Vidyarthi Bhavan around 7 AM is a must. The dosas are worth the wait (pro tip: go on a weekday to avoid long lines).
4. **Indiranagar’s Quiet Book Cafés** – A couple of lesser-known book cafés here are perfect for a cozy evening with a coffee. Anyone else loves a good book-and-coffee combo?

Bangaloreans, what are your favorite hidden spots? Or for anyone new here, feel free to ask for tips!

Let’s keep this thread going with cool recommendations and tips. Maybe we can create a little guide together!",1,1730997346.0,bangalore24,0,1.0,False
1glun8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/helpme/comments/1glun8a/i_feel_like_a_shell_of_what_i_could_be/,I feel like a shell of what I could be,"I turned 16 years old a few months ago. Before those years, I was deeply into nihilism and contemplated daily (not saying to sound impressive, I sat by my window and contemplated nature and our purpose for existing.) For a lack of better words, it feels like the colours of my existence is shifting, if that makes sense. In the time before now, the present, the air was cool and my head weightless and wearing the pin of “I Live Life to Be Happy.” However, after puberty, I’m not quite so sure anymore. I started exploring aesthetics to find a way to ‘fix’ my dysfunctional life. 

I thought I found my purpose. Dark Academia. The aesthetic in which it revolves around romanticising reading the classics, dressing in early 20th century and mid-century turtlenecks, sipping on a cup of pure black English coffee. Was it finally what I could latch onto and secure it as my raison d’etre? I don’t think so now. As the Dark-Academia-Obsessed days came to a close, I still feel like a shell of what I could be. Could do. Could become. This feeling is oppressive to the point of blinding my short-lived moments of joy walking with my family, in a perfectly chilly Autumn morning.

I cannot do it anymore. As a boy I’ve been subconsciously instilling the idea that “don’t cry; if you cry you’ll be seen as weak.” So I cry in privacy. Even then, I still feel disgusted with myself. Why am I crying? I’m crying because of the bottled emotions contained within my body over the years must eventually be released, one way or another. 

I tried to fix my life. For some time in 2023 I made self-improvement my existence. If I woke up at 5 in the morning, be slapped by the freezing cold water in the morning, finish my assignments, read books to improve my writing, and write to become a better writer. But, I’m afraid I’m losing my purpose. I pick up ideologies, integrate that belief in my life as much as possible—then I drop it. The layers of my life are unfolding from immaturity to maturity; yet this is a maturity that I’m not ready for. I set these standards for myself: excel, nurture your ambition, and be the best version of yourself. I’ve lost the definition of “the best version of yourself.” Is it mindless indulgement in a belief or multiple, or something else entirely? 

Even when I try to write my emotions, they come out in lyrical nonsense. I’m sick of myself and sick of this version of my life. Every waking moment is a dream. Some days I feel better than most; I’m convinced I’m in a dream. It has gotten to a point now that I’ve accepted that I’m in a dream that could at any moment be shattered and I would wake up to when I was 13 or even younger. If I could, I would. 

I suppose I’m overwhelmed by everything, with tasks, my goals, my aspirations, and watching as the world and everyone around me advance, while I’m left in the dark.

I don’t want to wallow in my pessimism. 

At this point in my life, I’m unsure: Unsure of what my future and of what I may turn out to be. I’ve asked my dad twice if I could go to therapy: he replied by, “your’re normal!” and laughing. I feel broken everyday.

I'm in england ,"The long and short of it is that my career experience is logistics, my mother isn't well so i'm looking at other projects if i leave my position to look after her 

In my current career i deal with primarily new or fledgling businesses looking to expand in to international markets. Since brexit, this is more difficult than ever, and 50% or more of these prospects will ultimately go through the process of applying for business accounts only to find out that what they're doing isnt financially viable, or they're unaware of the complications of international shipping etc 

I thought about opening a website where i would charge a flat rate for people to have an hour meeting with me, i would field all their questions and save them the hours of going through logistics firms only to find out they're going to hit a wall and be unable to proceed. 

I know that, for example, if you're an ebay seller and you reach a certain threshhold of revenue you need to declare it, but i'm curious about the legal implications of charging money for something online, for example in the photoshop request subreddit, people will pay the users for their submissions, on one of those 'buy me a coffee' apps or whatever. 

To make this legal would i need to register as a sole trader / ltd company with companies house immediately? or can i earn X amount of money without needing to do so?

Having 3 final product jets with one entering tethered flight is highly valuable and very important because every evtol company strides to get to that point where ur testing a final product towards certification Lilium is now getting to the point of actual certification tests

Regardless of what criticism says or thinks Lilium said probably a year and a half ago maybe 2 years ago that they had enough money to make it to flight testing! Which they did with 3 jets ready for testing

If Lilium has complications during flight testing then yes they are cooked but not fully someone will buy the Ip and the jets still

1glul75,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1glul75/affected_by_my_adhd_partners_bad_timing_for/,Affected by my adhd partner’s bad timing for things - hurting my mental health,"I [early30F] have been in a loving relationship with my partner [late30M] for four years now. He is loving, funny, charming, a hard worker, and a creative. I am also loving, friendly, adventurous, analytical, and a critical thinker. In some ways we are scarily similar, in others total opposites. My partner also has ADHD and doesn’t need medication for it, but does rely on some ADHD management skills. 

Most of the time, I don’t mind his ADHD and even find it endearing. He always offers me coffee and then won’t return for three hours for example, which I find very cute :)

There is one thing that isn’t cute and does affect me emotionally, and that’s his timing for things. I’ve noticed over the years that if he sees something that triggers his memory, he will want to do that thing, if he doesn’t see it, it’s out of mind. For example:

- He initiates sex only at bedtime when I am already sleepy. I’ve told him it’s not cool that this is the only time he initiates. He says that the bed triggers him to think of sex hence the timing.
- Or, if I am super stressed after work and then finally find peace from the stress, but only just, he decides this is the time to now dump all his stress on me. I honestly cannot handle it in those moments and I don’t do it to him either.

There are other things where timings are really inconsiderate. For example:

- I dissociated from a series of severe panic attacks. The first day that I started getting better, and I was still in a bad place, he decided that this was a great time to drop a secret of his that he’s been keeping (it wasn’t bad, but maybe a lil kinky). It’s an okay thing, but at that time in my life, it overwhelmed me and I regressed
- I almost drowned in a lake and finally got the courage to talk about it timidly with him, after working extensively with a therapist. He decided that was the moment to pour all of his fears about the drowning incident on to me. It triggered a panic attack as I really couldn’t handle it.

There are lots of other little “timing” issues that really stress me out. Little “what if” jokes that in the moment throw me off and make me question why we are doing something. He doesn’t do any of it intentionally, but I sometimes feel like he lacks the empathy to understand that right now is not the time for all of his thoughts to come out. I do want to hear him out if he needs to talk through things, but I wish he had the foresight to think about how the timing can really hurt me. And overtime, I have less and less capacity to deal with this issue as it’s really chipping away at me.

Is this a common ADHD trait? Have any of you experienced this with a partner, especially someone with ADHD? Are there any tips or resources that I can bring to my partner so we navigate this stuff better? I have already spoken to him about it, but because every incident is slightly different, he has a hard time remembering.

I would like to note that he really is an awesome guy. He is extremely supportive, he is an amazing listener, we have fun together, and he’s very respectful, kind, etc. literally one of the best people I have ever met in my life and I love him very very much.

","Me and my wife have been trying to make friends that resemble us (both black, in our late 20s, and homebody losers). We have enough non-black friends imo, but we are indefinitely the ""black couple"" in other groups friendships and it's exhausting. Especially in recent days. 

We've been trying to make friends when we go out to events, but I don't know if it's just not part of common culture anymore, if I'm just too autistically awkward, or if it's just because we're often one of the only non-white people in the room and people don't want to come up to us or something idk. But it's getting ridiculous at this point, last time we went out we got to talking with this one girl but she turned out to be like 21, unfortunately that's just a huge age gap for a 28-29 year olds. And that's happened a couple times now ngl, we look younger and are bad at judging ages (black don't crack) 

I'm tired of relying on my job to make friends, and don't want to have to move across the country just so I could be in the same state as my old friends. I can go to all the coffee shops, bookstores, art walks and yadda yadda that I could dream of, but having a single good conversation does not a friend make. And I want to be clear, we're not being weird about it, we're focusing on having a good time on our own, and if luck is on our side we'll start a conversation with someone, but it's not like we're predators in the bushes ambushing young black couples begging them to be friends with us lmaoo.

We've gone to renn faires, thrift markets, bars, coffee shops, parks, literally name it around here and we've been there. And maybe it's just the events we're going to, anyone have a good suggestion for events in Conway or LR they can point us to? ",7,1730997143.0,ConwayAR,16,0.73,False

1glucdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indianconfessions/comments/1glucdz/met_the_apartment_lady_again/,Met the apartment lady again ,"Remember, previously I had posted about the apartment lady. So, during these weeks we were having chats once in a while because her husband was at home and then she had gone to her native for Diwali holidays. Finally, three days back she came back to Bangalore and this time she came alone as her husband had some work in Delhi and he stayed back in Delhi. 

During the chats, I felt she was extra horny these times because of the lack of action in the last few weeks. So, as usual, she was teasing me with her Diwali outfits and she in fact did a video call to me when she was trying out the different ethnic outfits during Diwali. And on one of the days, she came back to her room when her family members were having dinner and she did a strict tease on the video call and made me jerk off to her.

During these few weeks, I told her how I couldn't take off my mind of her sexy, milky tits and how every time I get horny, I keep thinking of her tits and I feel instant hard-on. She heard this and she liked the compliments so much, she directly asked me, do you want to suck those titties again? 

She immediately sent snaps to tease me. This was two days back and finally today she messaged me in the morning and We had to meet around 2 p.m So from 2 p.m. To 5 p.m. Was one of the best time of my life. I'm back to my flat having coffee But trust me The experience I had today That is how sometimes we feel heaven is not elsewhere. It is here on earth.


When I went to her flat, she was in casuals. So as usual, we hugged briefly. Then we kissed and we started talking. We were talking about our business and my work. And after some time, she asked me to stay for two minutes. She'll be back. And she went inside. And even in the wildest dreams, I wouldn't have imagined she came back wearing the same ethnic dress that she used to tease me the other day.

Seeing her milky cleavage and her neck and her hair, I got so turned on. As soon as she came close to me and sat next to me, I pounced onto her, started kissing her neck and started softly biting her neck. She was softly moaning and she asked me to lick off her tits on her cleavage. Then I couldn't wait. I pulled down the dress just so that her tits are visible. I started sucking the tits, using my tongue to make circles on her nipples and softly started sucking the nipples and biting the nipples and pulling them with the teeth. By this time she was moaning and I inserted my two fingers into her mouth and she started sucking my fingers.

She then started biting my lips and biting my earlobes and playing with my hair, pulling my hair. She started licking my neckline, the shoulder bone. She started licking my chest and finally she pushed me onto the sofa. She took the ethnic dress, came over, sat on me. She pulled down my pants. By then I was so fucking hot, she rubbed myself and she guided myself onto her and she sat on me. With this still on her, she started moving in slow motions, looking into each other's eyes, her hands resting on my chest and her tits juggling.

This was so fucking sensual to me. I started moaning and she loved it and she increased the pace. Suddenly she bends down and she bit my lips and she started sucking my tongue. For one moment I felt so weak in my knees. I would have literally agreed to whatever she said in that moment. Again she goes back to her posture and she starts moving on me and in fact it's so jiggling. Now finally my hands were free and I started pinching the nipples and I put my hands around her neck and I held her hair and pulled her back. She was enjoying the pain at the same time jumping on me. 

After some time, she sat down on the floor, kneeling down, and took my dick in hand, and pulled down the skin backwards. She held my dick with both the hands, cusping around the dick, and with her thumb, she started making circles on my head. Fuck, the feeling was so sensual. Literally, my back was arcing, and I started slightly shivering, and I started moaning again. This was the best feeling I ever had, and a woman could pleasure me. She then suddenly puts a mouth, and takes me deep inside, and starts sucking me like a whore. And eventually when I was about to cum, she pulled out the dick, and made me cum on her tits. Trust me, I would do anything to repeat that scene again in my life. My cum on her cleavage was looking so hot. Then she rubbed the cum all over on her tits, and then she rubbed her tits to my dick, and started sucking my dick again. Fuck, this lady knows what pleasure is.

After this, we started watching her favorite show and started smoking up. And all this while, she was lying on the sofa and she put her thighs on me and she was resting and watching. Once in a while, she randomly took my hand, placed it on her tits, placed it on her tummy, and she used to guide my hand and made me rub herself. It was so fucking heavenly.

Historically I don’t believe that would be the case though. 

For context- I’m considering a mini because within the next 6 months I’m wanting to start a retrofitted vintage car coffee pop up. So I would use the mini for daily home use, and then in the future weekend pop up use.

They describe it as having a balance of sweetness and nutty notes. So, I decided to put it to the test with my trusty setup at home.

Grind: I went with a medium grind, aiming to extract a full range of flavors without overdoing it.

Brewing Method: I chose the pour-over method for this experiment to really let the coffee’s oils and aromas come through.

Now, I’m curious about your experiences with this blend. What flavors do you usually detect in your cup of Silver Oak Blend? Have you found any particular brewing method that enhances its characteristics best?
