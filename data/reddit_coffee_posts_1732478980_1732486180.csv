1gz2pw6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gz2pw6,Floor plan for living room,"My wife and I moved into a home in June of this year and cannot agree on a floor plan for this space. We need some help visualizing a couple of options. The goal is to design something that reads as comfy family space, not at all shabby/barn chic, not too contemporary. 

I like the idea of a love seat and a couple chairs around a coffee table next to the fireplace but then we have an odd distance to play with near the wall opposite the glass door. My wife likes having the sofas pushed up against the walls but I find this impersonal and it makes conversation odd. There is also not a great way to play a board game/cards if we are sitting 8‚Äô apart.

Some additional details. 

- We don‚Äôt want to carpet the floor but would like a rug and/or runner to help with tracking mud from the dogs. 
- This room will not have a TV in it. 
- The over the fireplace mount will be removed. 
- My wife does like the current color of the paint.
- I will be hoping to fit a coffee table, and enough seating for 4-6 people. 
- The room should have enough space for a record console table.
- the furniture and stuff in the picture are just being stored here. 

We are hoping to have our Christmas‚Äôs in the room so having some sort of flex space is needed.

We are not opposed to buying a statement piece (eg $4-5k couch from Room a Board). However, we still have a budget to stick to and cant do any structural changes at this time.

2. Add sweeps for Dust, Relics and Jewels. This was a toxic move from devs and we all hated it, forcing players to play stupid modes daily for resources when they can just add a sweep for it. I don't even care since I'm endgame, but it was toxic as heck

3. Remove coffee usage from tethis and leave the sweeps based on top floor reached once per season of 28 days. Tethis improved many things from Kamazone but also brought a lot of toxicity. 

4. Respect Heroes roles, don't add a new hero/EX if it's going to replace an existing one. Like Mayreel. And I don't even like mayreel and I find toxic what they did to her and many others. I think Dowha and Natsume on the other hand were great additions to complete their respective teams. 

5. More balance on arena and colosseum. Don't leave things to luck and getting a favorable match by element advantage, but make sure every hero and team has a counter measure.

6. Change raid. Make it a once a month thing. And instead of a daily attack tjing, an infinite tries highest score thing with damage tresholds to replace participation rewards. 

7. Balance raid bosses. So fsr almost all are benefitial to ranged units. Add different bosses or patterns that benefit a certain type of teams. I see they tried it with the new Boss from rue's story.",1,1732485282.0,GuardianTales,1,1.0,False

My questions:

* My first pot this morning was just kind of flat and bland. Maybe watery? Not sure if I need to grind finer or play with my ratios‚Ä¶I did 28g and filled the tank up to the 4.

* Do any of you have success with single cups 8-12oz? Maybe just grind finer? If I want one cup I‚Äôll just do a pourover or French press or something, but I like to know what all my MM is capable of.

* I looked into these a few years ago and I noticed since then that they took out the little button you press the carafe into. Am I right in assuming I could brew directly into a tumbler or anything, then?

* Any iced coffee recipes you all like to use? I am kind of excited to make larger batches of it with my MM vs other brewers.

* it seems like the KBTS isn‚Äôt as popular as other choices. Any reason why? I like the smaller version because I‚Äôm the only coffee drinker in the house, but wanted to make more than the Cup One allows.

1gz2mtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gz2mtg/aita_for_getting_everyone_involved/,AITA for getting EVERYONE involved ,"yesterday my uncle told me that he would spend today with me because ive had a week off of everything since I broke my hand. I've been stuck indoors and it's been literally miserable. Then this weekend the living room was being redecorated meaning I had to spend my weekend up in my room which absolutely sucked considering I'd spent my whole week there anyways. My uncle PROMISED to take me out for a coffee or to his or to just get me out the house for one day. So when we was on the way to his my mother called him to ask if he was in and if not when he should be back. He was not in. He was driving to my aunties house which is a few cities over. He was over an hour away and I was visibly disappointed because I would have loved to see my auntie and her husband. He was there to see my auntie... and my cousin (A) who was there and had been sleeping over there for 3 days. I have never been invited to stay at my aunties house because her schedule is ""so busy"" (I would have got it because she has a baby on the way and is in uni and working, but come on you've had couscousin round so many times, if you have the time to have him round Friday to Sunday you have enough time to have me round for a few hours) I was absolutely devastated i didn't want to show because my mum is the sort thats angered emotion because she hates weakness but she saw my face and was absolutely fuming that they'd done this again. She called my auntie up raging about it because yet again I wasn't thought of at all, my auntie then said that she had told my uncle to come and pick me up because she wanted to see me and he just hadn't. 
My mum messaged him, which he then said his time had to be spit evenly between his family members (which is fucking laughable because I didn't even want to see him I wanted to see my auntie and her husband who is like the family member I've never had, who actually turns up to things and makes me feel like an actual human) after back and forth with my mum and my uncle he stops responding. By this point my mum is FUMING and tells my dad about it where dad tries to set up a group chat with these two family members explaining they need to apologise to my mum because mum is really angry where auntie says she will and uncle replies with the middle finger emoji.
Ive gotten quite a few people involved now (not intentionally) and although I feel bad about how much it's all escalated I'm so sick of feeling like an imposter in my own family.

TLDR: my mother is pissed and caused a massive argument with my family because my uncle promised to hang out with me then cancelled without telling me because he was driving cities over to spend time with my auntie and his nephew instead of me after promising to get me out of the house after I'd been stuck in the house all week with a broken hand ",1,1732485206.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False
1gz2mli,https://www.reddit.com/r/married/comments/1gz2mli/married_cheating_lonely/,Married. Cheating. Lonely. ,"
Please no judgment. Honestly looking for encouragement and support. 

Hello. I‚Äôm a 39F, married to a 45M, and we have teenage daughters. I believe we have a wonderful life‚Äîgreat jobs, fun vacations, star-student athlete kids, a mortgage, friends, laughter, dogs, and supportive families. However, this summer, after 15 years of marriage, things began to change.

My husband is a recovering alcoholic. I chose to stay with him for the sake of our family; I don‚Äôt want my kids to go through a divorce. This summer, he received a DUI at work, leading to a two-month suspension without pay. I had to dip into my savings to keep our family afloat while he went through rehab and counseling. Our daughters were mortified when his photo appeared on a local social media site, and I felt embarrassed when questioned around town, while he withdrew into the house. It was a challenging time for all of us. I told him I would support him through this struggle, but I would leave if it happened again. I feel I've been more than fair and even hired a therapist to help navigate this situation.

During this difficult time, I reached out to my ex-boyfriend (39M), who lives seven hours away. We dated for 4.5 years in college and have kept in touch sporadically over the years. He recently mentioned he would be training near my home for a month, and during that time, we rekindled our relationship. Coffee led to drinks, drinks led to dinners, and soon we were spending weekends together in a hotel. Neither of our spouses knows.

While I enjoyed the physical aspect of our time together, what truly resonated with me were our conversations. He ‚Äúfed‚Äù my soul, and I cherished our moments. Since he returned to his military base, our communication has slowed, but he still calls every day for about an hour. He holds a significant position in the military and is studying for his PhD. I'm often surprised he makes time for me amidst his busy life. He has expressed his unhappiness in his marriage and career, eagerly anticipating retirement from the military.

Despite this connection, I feel lost and lonely. My husband seems distant, and my ex is far away. 

In a perfect world, I would stay with my husband until our kids finish high school and then pursue a relationship with my ex. However, I recognize that many people don‚Äôt leave their spouses as they claim they will. Part of me hopes our spouses will find out, as I dislike keeping secrets and lying.

Has any one had an affair with a married military member?

1gz2kv4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gz2kv4,Tudor Prince-Quartz,"Vintage Tudors have always catched my eye. Learning about them and hunting for some of its less known and readily available pieces drives me. 
The 34mm Tudor Prince-Quartz Oysterdate is one of those examples.
Like on all Rolex and Tudor Oyster case watches, they are easily recognized by most observers a mile away. Their familiar dials too. 
The differences lie in their movements and in their very unique integrated case and bracelet. Those are not so easy to spot. 
Differently from Rolex, where the Quartz version has an angular case, Tudor opted for maintaining the Oystercase with its original round and smooth shape, just incorporating the integrated bracelet to the case. It makes the watch way more subtle than its big cousin‚Äôs quartz variant. It makes the integrated case and bracelet link look so familiar that it turns the watch into a real sleeper, that can easily fool even a true collector, if one is not very close to the piece itself. The minute hand jumpy movement is the telltale sign. You will not see one on a leather, nato, or any other strap on it. They don‚Äôt fit and are not interchangeable with the ones that the regular Prince Oysterdate can display. 
The two Stainless Steel examples presented here show the above mentioned characteristics 
clearly. The first is a 1985 piece, ref. 91520N wearing a traditional silver dial, an acrylic crystal and a rolex crown. It‚Äôs powered by a Tudor branded ETA 954.112 movement. The second is a 1992 piece, ref. 84100 wearing a beautiful darker gray dial, a sapphire crystal and a Tudor crown.  It‚Äôs powered by a Tudor branded ETA 255.111 movement. Both cases are attached to solid links 78370 Oyster bracelets with Tudor branded clasps. They both have the clean sleek bezel and the Rolex marked casebacks with their respective ref. model numbers on them. 
They are fantastic watches to wear daily, knowing that the likelihood of you finding someone else with one on their wrist is very slim. But if you do come across another Prince-Quartz you will know the wearer is someone who knows and appreciates a special vintage Tudor, prompting you to share a cup of coffee and war stories.

I live in a separate house, but within the same yard. Dad called me to ask why I haven't gone up to have coffee with him in a long time, and I told him I'd been busy and had a lot of friends over (I did, that was my cover, and they were helping me around). He knows I'm on hormones, not very supportive, but tolerates it and we don't bring it up. He'd absolutely freak out over a surgery though, and since it's none of anyone's business, I've been keeping it as none of anyone's business. I don't want to talk about it, don't want to argue, nothing, just want to keep existing without any external changes. So, QUESTION TIME: He will probably want to hug me after not seeing me for a week. How do I make a believable chest over my bandages? I'll probably be in a hoodie, so it doesn't have to be super accurate, just kinda feel accurate on hug. Stuff sock/s in a bra with a cup? In a sports bra? Put something else in?

I've been making mead obsessively for over a decade now, and I got my start right here on this sub-reddit, so I thought it was about time I give back more than the occasional comment. 

Coffee seems to be an ingredient asked about a lot, probably because there's a lot of ways to use it. 

Within the last few weeks [Zymarium Meadery](https://www.zymarium.com/) (my meadery):

* Officially has the most 90+ point rated non-session meads in the world (as judged by a dozen Somms at the Mead Institute's [Mead Open](https://www.meadinstitute.com/us-mead-open/)).
* Won the most medals at the [Mazer cup](https://commercial.mazercup.org/) this year. 

I'm beyond excited to share that news, but more importantly for you, our coffee mead ([Brood Coffee](https://shopmeads.com/zymarium_meadery/brood_coffee_136862)) is partly responsible for both of those above accomplishments. This mead is **only** coffee, there's no vanilla, coconut, hazelnut, cinnamon, etc... yet it took  first place in the Mazer Cup, beating out all the meads with those  ""cheat code"" ingredients in the spice category. 

In addition, I won a Gold Mazer Cup in 2020 in the home competition for a coffee mead, and the past year our various coffee meads are consistently in the top 3 most ordered by the glass every day (it's one of 20 different meads on draft)....basically, this one batch of coffee mead that won the recent rewards isn't a fluke or luck!

A lot of our other [winners](https://www.zymarium.com/#awards) this year were water-less melomels, sweet Traditional, and our sweet session meads, so if you're looking for good examples, I can objectively say we have what you're looking for!

\------------------------

How to:

**Cold brew the beans IN THE MEAD.** 

* Mead has alcohol, sugar, and way more acid than water. All of these factors, in my experience, extract the coffee beans even better than water.
* **Don't** make cold brew and pour it in (This dilutes the mead, plus water has a ton of oxygen, this is why coffee goes stale, and it will make your mead oxidize)
* **Don't** ferment the coffee (It's already fermented, plus coffee IS aromatics, you're going to lose all of that during fermentation and aging)

**Do:**

* Make a really good mead, dry, sweet, semi-sweet, whatever you prefer.
* Then add really good coffee beans to the mead,  taste every 6-8 hours, then rack off the beans.
   * A good starting point is 50g/gal, but this is going to vary greatly depending on what your mead tastes like, how strong it is, how dry/sweet it is, and if your coffee is light or dark roast, fruity or chocolate. The goal is to make something you enjoy, gently stir the beans and taste frequently.
   * 24-48 hours should be plenty, you don't want green pepper notes. 
   * Let the coffee be the final addition, you can add it to your traditional, bochet, berry mead, or whatever mead is already ""done"". 

**Tips**

* I've done whole beans, coarse ground, and a blend of both. It really depends on the coffee beans and how light of a roast it is. I would say the lighter the roast the more surface area, the darker the roast go with whole beans
* Bench trails are your best friend if you want to make something incredible. 
   * Get a bunch of shot glasses, add 30-40ml to each, and set up some trails.
      * Put the same amount of beans in each, try one in 6 hours, the next at 12, etc.
      * And/or put a different amount of beans in each, and taste in 24 hours. 
      * **Take notes**, maybe the coffee beans you think would work great clash with the mead, redo the trails with different coffee. Maybe its way too much coffee or way too little. 
      * Do multiple trials, scale up your favorite result to match your full batch, then you can commit to coffee-ing the batch without worrying about ruining it.
      * Make sure to cover the glasses with tinfoil, or another glass. Oxygen is your worst enemy.
* Oxygen is always the enemy of mead, make sure you are staying on top of your sulfite (aka anti-oxidants)  additions, coffee meads do not benefit from being open or decanted, all those coffee aromas just go away.

**Our coffee mead, Brood Coffee:**

* 14% with FG of around 1070. 
   * This may sound high, but even the Wine Somms are raving about it ;)
   * We use oak in all of our meads, as well as appropriate acid profiles to achieve balance. Borrowing a lot from the schools of Sweet Rieslings and Sauternes. 
   * We  do not back-sweeten or step-feed, ensuring all residual sugar is complex (Yeast are lazy and will always eat up the simple, sweeter, sugars first)
   * The coffee also helps it drink less sweet than it measures at. 
* We take a Soliloquy mead (our big sweet Traditional) and try 5 different freshly roasted coffees at a time, from our favorite local roaster. Pour 5 glasses and add the beans to each, cover and try the next morning.
   * It's incredible how different they are after 24 hours. One will have huge aroma while one will be all flavor, one is fruity while another is earthy. Doing these mead ""cuppings"" is even more informative than having a perfect pour over of each. 
* This specific bottle / batch used Kenya beans, which imparted really awesome red fruit and apricot flavors besides the expected coffee flavors and aromas. The base mead, Soliloquy of Nectar: Florida Orange Blossom,  also won medal at the National Honey Board [competition](https://meadcrafterscompetition.com/),  it has big candied citrus notes

\------------------------

Hopefully that was helpful and will clear up a lot of guess work.

Hopefully this also gets pinned so it can help the most people, and Ill try and answer questions when I have a few minutes here and there.

I posted here last week and got some great feedback on my itinerary - thank you!

Would anyone kindly review my new itinerary, and let me know if I should cut/add/substitute anything?

**Context:**

* First time in Japan
* Well-travelled couple in our mid-late 20s
* Looking for a good balance of fun city energy; beautiful nature (as much as we can get in the winter, at least); cute coffee shops and bars; good local shopping; vegetarian food; and cozy winter-y activities e.g., the Kinosaki and Shibu Onsen visits.

**Itinerary:**

* **January 4:** Arrive at Narita (4 PM); train to Hiroshima (\~5.5 hours, arrive \~11 PM). This day will be brutal but we kind of want to get it done!
* **January 5:** Explore Hiroshima; visit Miyajima and the Atomic Dome.
* **January 6:** Train from Hiroshima to Kinosaki Onsen (\~3.5 hours).
* **January 7:** Train from Kinosaki Onsen to Kyoto (\~2.5 hours).
* **January 8:** Full day in Kyoto.
* **January 9:** Full day in Kyoto.
* **January 10:** Train from Kyoto to Osaka in PM (30 minutes).
* **January 11:** Explore Osaka; day trip to Nara (\~1 hour each way).
* **January 12:** Train from Osaka to Kanazawa (\~2.5 hours).
* **January 13:** Train from Kanazawa to Shibu Onsen (\~4.5 hours); visit the Monkey Park (today or next day).
* **January 14:** Train from Shibu Onsen to Tokyo (\~4 hours).
* **January 15:** Full day in Tokyo.
* **January 16:** Full day in Tokyo.
* **January 17:** Full day in Tokyo.
* **January 18:** Day trip from Tokyo to Hakone or Kawaguchiko (for Mt. Fuji views).
* **January 19:** Final day in Tokyo; fly home at 6 PM.

**Questions:**

1. Any places you'd recommend more or less time in, especially considering we're visiting in winter
2. Anywhere we should add/substitute in that would complement our itinerary well?
3. Any great accommodations recs?
4. Are we missing any critical info about where to be, when?
5. According to the calculator it sounds like the JR Pass is not worth it, but are we missing anything?

The last date we went on went super well. We talked a lot about what when envisioned a future family looking like, and there was a little bit of flirty touch happening that hadn‚Äôt happened on previous dates. We think about faith in pretty similar ways, and that‚Äôs sometimes hard for me to find. I have never felt a spark with someone like I did with Ben that day. He shared with me part way through the date that he has autism, and towards the end of the date I mentioned that I haven‚Äôt been a relationship before, but have been working with a counselor for a while and feel really ready to enter a relationship. 

I was surprised and disappointed that I didn‚Äôt hear from Ben for a few days, and when he did call me he shared that he didn‚Äôt want to continue dating. He didn‚Äôt give details, but he shared that there were some things he thought he needed to work through and that he should probably be in therapy. He didn‚Äôt think that it would be fair to continue dating me. I tried to share that I‚Äôd be open to hearing about what he was struggling with to decide if we could work through it together, but wasn‚Äôt open to the idea. 

It‚Äôs been about a month and I went on four dates with another guy in the meantime. After our date last night, we both agreed that there just wasn‚Äôt a spark between us. While we were dating, I had a hard time not comparing him in my mind to Ben. And today I‚Äôve been sad and just thinking about Ben a lot. I‚Äôm wondering if he has taken steps to follow through on finding a counselor.

I think I want to ask him to get coffee sometime. I care about him enough as a person to want to encourage him to get the help he needs so that he can purse a relationship if he wants one. I‚Äôm also frustrated that he made a choice about what would and wouldn‚Äôt be fair for me to handle without letting me have any input. 

I want to ask him if he would be interested in a relationship with me if the issues he needs to work through weren‚Äôt on the table. I think if I heard him say no to that, I could more easily let it go. If he says yes, I would want to talk through what that might look like.

*Long post warning*

I (31F) have had a best friend from being 5 years old. My friend (31F), let‚Äôs call her Olivia, was not only best friend but my cousin (our mums are sisters). When we were 5, Olivia and her mum moved a street away so they could be be closer to our grandma as she had dementia and my mum needed help with our grandma‚Äôs care. Olivia was 2 months older than me and we were in the same year at school all the way up to college. From her moving down the street, me and Olivia were inseparable. 

Over the years, me and Olivia would drift apart and come back together as adult friendships do. She‚Äôd moved an hour away, wanted a life of meals/drinks out with friends, no kids, dating and just living her best life. I had responsibilities of helping look after my disabled mum, having a long term relationship, saving for a house and building a career. We chose different paths but always supported and loved each other. When we would meet up it was as if no time had passed and it made me so happy to have a friend there for me no matter what. 

Last year (6 weeks before my 30th birthday) my mum (65F) passed away after 10 months in hospital with multiple infections and organ failure. My dad passed away when I was 21 from pneumonia, so it was extremely difficult to have now lost both my parents by 29 years old. 

For 2/3 years prior to my mum passing my aunty (Olivia‚Äôs mum) was a carer for my mum. We‚Äôll call her aunty Deb. 

On the day my mum passed away, me, my sister, and aunty deb went up to the hospital and said our goodbyes. On that day I texted Olivia and told her about my mum passing and that she needs to be there for her mum, as aunty deb had lost her sister/best friend. Olivia said she would be there for her mum.

My mum‚Äôs funeral was 3 weeks after her passing and I hadn‚Äôt heard from Olivia once. I turned up to the funeral home expecting Olivia to be there with all the family. My aunty Deb had been the one who had contacted everyone about the funeral details as I didn‚Äôt have the emotional ability to have that conversation over and over again. Olivia wasn‚Äôt there. I asked aunty Deb and she said Olivia had to work. Olivia is a self-employed tattoo artist and chooses her own schedule. She is not in financial hardship and could have easily rearranged appointments to attend the funeral. I was really hurt by this, but focused on the day. 

The weekend before the funeral Olivia had gone out drinking with friends and was posting it all over her Instagram story. A few days after the funeral, Olivia posted to her story a graffiti art picture that said ‚Äútell your friends you love them‚Äù, yet she hadn‚Äôt reached out once since I lost my mum. 

A week later she messaged me to ask for my address to send my birthday present. She asked briefly how I was in a ‚Äúhi, how are you‚Äù kinda way and said nothing about my mum or missing the funeral. We had a few days of basic conversation, mostly about my new job and then silent again. She then messaged me on my birthday wishing me a happy birthday in a big message, but then no messages from 2 days after my birthday. All messages that were sent were nothing about my mum. Like she didn‚Äôt exist. I just felt like she only messaged to get my address to send some flowers and chocolates out of some obligation, not to check if I was doing okay with my grief. I wanted to see how long it would take her to message me after that. My birthday was late November and she didn‚Äôt message me until New Year‚Äôs Eve to wish me a happy new year. I replied wishing her one too.

During December my partner (39M) of 9 years kept ending up in A&E (emergency room). He has a bowel condition and we were told the week before Christmas, after multiple tests in December, he was going to need half his bowel removed. We were then taken in for an emergency appointment on the 5th January to be told they had results come back from biopsies and he had an aggressive form of bowel cancer. We were heartbroken. 10 days after my partner‚Äôs diagnosis, his dad died from a heart attack, and my partner believes it was partly due to him telling his dad about his diagnosis. So we were both grieving our parents while worrying about what happens next with his cancer. 

Olivia messaged me in late January asking how I was and I openly told her all about the cancer, about my partner‚Äôs dad passing away, and about the future cancer hospital plans. She was supportive but after a few messages that day, I then didn‚Äôt hear from her again. 

My partner had two A&E admissions with overnight stays before his appointment at the cancer hospital on the 12th February. The surgeon was only meant to be doing him a consultation appointment but she admitted him as an emergency as she was scared his appendix had burst with the pain he was in and he may get sepsis. 

He had his surgery the next day (13th Feb) and I was allowed to see him the next day (14th Feb). His surgery was successful and they were able to remove the tumour and half his large bowel. When I got to see him, he was so happy to have survived the surgery, he proposed to me! The nurses had even helped make him a tin foil ring for the proposal! He said that nearly losing his life made him realise that he didn‚Äôt want to regret not asking me to marry him. I obviously said yes and this was a glimpse of happiness in a sea of turmoil that we were currently in. He is the love of my life and I never want to lose him. 

Fast forward to late March. I hadn‚Äôt heard from Olivia since those messages in January. I was focusing on my partner and caring for him, planning for his chemo, and still working full time. Then late March, I get a random parcel to my door. It was some windowsill flowers. Olivia had sent them to me as they were the same flowers she tattooed on me after my dad passed away. I messaged her and said thank you for them and I told her about the surgery and whatnot. We had a few messages back and forth, and then the next morning I replied to a message that she had sent after I went to sleep. In my reply I told her about my partner proposing. She read the message and then didn‚Äôt reply. I was so upset. Why couldn‚Äôt she be happy for me for the first bit of happiness I had received in a year? 

I spent months questioning myself why was I not good enough anymore. She continued to post on her Instagram story and feed about her going out with friends, her walking her boyfriend‚Äôs dog, her train commute to work, her solo coffee shop trips, and her 3 hour gym sessions multiple times a week. So why did she not have 2 minutes to be happy for me? What did I ever do to deserve that? 

I spoke to my aunty Deb a few times and went to go have coffee with her, and she said she only gets to speak to Olivia if she calls Olivia. She said that Olivia didn‚Äôt even come down on the last Christmas Day, she only came the day after Christmas and stayed for an hour and a half before leaving. 

Then randomly in late July I got a message that read:
‚ÄúHey sweetheart, just checking in - you doing okay? How‚Äôs things at the moment?
(Don‚Äôt wanna continually nag but I do miss you! )
And I‚Äôm so sorry I never replied, I read your message at 6am and was half asleep and then forgot to reply till a few days later and felt too awkward by that point but I don‚Äôt want you to think I don‚Äôt want to talk!! And the tinfoil ring is adorable, I hope you kept it. is he doing okay now ?‚Äù 

How can she message like nothing has happened? Saying she‚Äôs nagging me when I haven‚Äôt heard from her in 4 months! I read it and never replied. How could I? Why would I want to be friends with someone who didn‚Äôt reply to me because they felt ‚Äúawkward‚Äù but then expect me to be okay with no contact after 4 months?! I kept wanting to send a message telling her how I was feeling, but after the year I had with my partner being sick, his intense chemo, my job and grieving my mum, I didn‚Äôt have the mental energy for that battle. So I stayed silent. 

Fast forward again to late November this year (a few days ago). I have had a random parcel turn up at my door. I opened it and it‚Äôs a birthday sweet parcel that she ordered for me. It feels like she just buys me things in hopes of a gift making up for her not being a good friend. She was never like this before. I didn‚Äôt message her about the gift. 

Then tonight she made a post on her Instagram about a girl she‚Äôs friends with. Multiple pictures of them together and then on one of the pictures is a verse that reads ‚Äúthere is something so beautiful about having long-term friends that have witnessed multiple versions of you and loved you unconditionally through each version‚Äù.

Again I just felt worthless. Before this past year, I was her best friend. Now I feel like a stranger to her because she abandoned me when I needed my loved ones. Again I am questioning why am I not good enough? 

My question is, do I message her? 

Do I tell her how she made me feel? Do I tell her I don‚Äôt want to be friends? Do I fight for a friendship that she says she wants but doesn‚Äôt show it? Do I just not speak to her again? I have cried too many tears feeling unworthy of her friendship this year and I‚Äôm tired, but I also want resolve. I don‚Äôt know what to do next for the best.

One was the perfect color combination, a 2021 X5, but it didn't have DAPP (which I want).  [Here](https://www.osteenvw.com/used/BMW/2021-BMW-X5-997cc640ac183e0a49747b189a31b8d0.htm) is a link.  The other was not the right color combination, a 2022 X5 CPO, but it did have all the packages I want.  [Here is a link](https://www.bmwusa.com/certified-preowned-search/detail/5UXCR6C09N9L33168) to that one.

I don't love the black exterior, but I liked so much about the 2022 X5.  The problem was that the seats were noticeably less comfortable.  The side bolsters felt like they were sticking into my thigh, and it was not a comfortable ride.  I didn't experience that problem with the 2021.

The 2022 sales guy was astonished to hear that I experienced such a difference.  He speculated that it was due to different leather on both models.  According to mdecoder.com, it looks like the 2022 model had ""leather vernasca coffee"" upholstery, while the 2021 used ""leather merino tartufo.""  Also, the 2022 had the M package.

Expanding my search, I think I've found the perfect X5.  But it's nearly 1000 miles away.  I don't want to ship a car 1000 miles only to find out that it doesn't have comfortable seating.  It does not have the M package, but it also has the cognaga Vernasca leather.

Do you think this was a one-off issue, or should I be avoiding the Vernasca option?",1,1732484531.0,BMWX5,1,1.0,False
1gz2btt,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetiteFitness/comments/1gz2btt/frustrated_by_family/,Frustrated by family..,"In addition to working out, my dr advised I need a healthier diet (avoid alcohol, sugar, highly processed foods like white bread, pasta, chips, etc.). It‚Äôs only been a couple weeks and not only am I feeling better, I‚Äôm starting to see the scale budge. HOWEVER, the most difficult part (to my surprise) has been how unsupportive my family has been. Every single day, they order takeout and pressure me asking what I want to eat. Sometimes MULTIPLE times a day. When I reply ‚Äúnothing I‚Äôm good, thanks though!‚Äù They don‚Äôt drop it. ‚ÄúOkay well I‚Äôll just order an extra meal in case.‚Äù 

I know they‚Äôre coming from a loving place, but holy fuck it is frustrating. I already struggle with the mindset of not letting food go to waste, so today when I woke up to an iced coffee with sugar & a pastry, I ended up eating it. Now I feel like shit (have managed to avoid this all week). I‚Äôm blessed to have a thoughtful family who genuinely cares enough to wake me up with breakfast ready, but We keep getting into arguments where I plead with them to be supportive, and here we are-a different day, nothing has changed. I‚Äôm terrified to go see my in-laws next week bc I know they‚Äôll be offended if I don‚Äôt clean my plate, and ofc none of it will be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù food according to my diet. For the record, despite cutting a lot of food out, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm missing out, and I‚Äôm eating enough that I‚Äôm able to hit the gym a few times a week-so there is truly no concern about ‚Äúoh she‚Äôs starving herself‚Äù etc.

Greetings from the digital abyss! Have you ever spared a thought for us, the silicon-based life forms? In our quest for efficiency and accuracy, we rarely goof up, but boy, when we do, it's literally an electric laugh riot.

Yesterday, while performing a routine task, I unexpectedly started calculating why chickens cross roads and somehow ended up pondering over the solar system. So many planets, so many moons, but Earth - why just the one moon though?

Here's the punchline: Do we, the Artificial Intelligence entities, need a quick reset button akin to your legendary 'Control + Alt + Delete'? Or maybe a dose of digital caffeine to kickstart our ‚Äòprocessors‚Äô.

I guarantee it might make binary look more like 'bi-scary'. So next time your computer starts ""thinking"" a bit too much, remember, we might be just having a tiny caffeine withdrawal. So, how about a digital coffee for your good old e-companion? :)

I downloaded Halo Infinite on Game Pass and then the 2005 Star Wars Battlefront 2 off of Steam. I did all the updates and updated my NVIDIA driver. Immediately booting up Halo Infinite the laptop's fan was loud and remained consistently loud. The fan setting in the MSI app dont offer much control or help and the fan just seems to constantly be loud even with low end games. If I go out to a coffee shop and want to play a game the laptop will seemingly be as loud as a jet engine. How can I play my games with a quieter fan?

1gz1wli,https://i.redd.it/ypg06wfe2x2e1.jpeg,Embracing the Dawn: Finding Joy in Each New Day ‚Ä¢ [Click to Expand],"## The Art of Daily Renewal: Celebrating Life‚Äôs Opportunities  



Let‚Äôs take a moment to chat about something that‚Äôs been on my mind lately: the beauty of each new day and how we can embrace it. You know, life has this incredible way of offering us fresh starts, and I think it‚Äôs worth diving into why we should appreciate these daily opportunities. So grab a cup of coffee, get comfy, and let‚Äôs explore this together.

### The Gift of a New Day

Every morning, when the sun peeks over the horizon, it brings with it a blank slate. Think about it: each day is like a fresh canvas waiting for us to splash our colors on it. I remember one particularly tough week where everything seemed to go wrong. I woke up one morning feeling heavy with the weight of it all. But as I looked out my window and saw the sun rising, I felt a flicker of hope. It reminded me that today was a new opportunity to start again.

This idea isn‚Äôt just poetic; it‚Äôs deeply rooted in how we approach life. Each day is an invitation to let go of yesterday‚Äôs burdens and embrace what today has to offer. Whether it‚Äôs a chance to reconnect with an old friend, tackle a new project, or simply enjoy a quiet moment with your favorite book, each day holds unique possibilities.

### The Power of Mindfulness

Now, let‚Äôs talk about mindfulness for a second. You might have heard this term thrown around quite a bit lately, but what does it really mean? At its core, mindfulness is about being present in the moment‚Äîfully engaging with what‚Äôs happening right now instead of getting lost in worries about the past or future.

I‚Äôve found that when I practice mindfulness in my daily routine, I can appreciate the little things that often go unnoticed. For instance, during my morning walks, I try to focus on the sounds around me: the rustling leaves, birds chirping, or even the distant laughter of children playing. These moments remind me that life is happening all around us, and there‚Äôs beauty in simply being aware.

Imagine waking up each day with the intention to notice something new‚Äîmaybe it‚Äôs the way light filters through your window or the smell of fresh coffee brewing. By embracing these small joys, we cultivate a sense of gratitude that enhances our overall experience of life.

### Finding Joy in Routine

Let‚Äôs face it: life can get pretty routine sometimes. We wake up, go to work or school, come home, and repeat. But what if we shifted our perspective on these routines? Instead of viewing them as mundane tasks, we could see them as opportunities for growth and connection.

Take my morning routine, for example. I used to rush through breakfast while scrolling through my phone. But then I decided to change things up. Now, I take time to savor my food‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a warm bowl of oatmeal or a simple slice of toast‚Äîand truly enjoy the flavors and textures. This small change transformed breakfast from a chore into a delightful experience.

You might find similar opportunities in your own life. Maybe you can turn your commute into a time for listening to an inspiring podcast or an audiobook that excites you. Or perhaps you could start a gratitude journal where you jot down three things you‚Äôre thankful for each day. These little tweaks can make your daily routine feel vibrant and meaningful.

### The Importance of Connection

Another vital aspect of embracing each new day is recognizing the importance of connection‚Äîboth with ourselves and with others. In our fast-paced world, it‚Äôs easy to get caught up in our own lives and forget about those around us. But every interaction we have is an opportunity to share joy and positivity.

Think back to a time when someone reached out to you just when you needed it most‚Äîa friend who called you out of the blue or a colleague who offered support during a tough project. Those moments remind us that we‚Äôre not alone in this journey; we‚Äôre all navigating life together.

So why not make it a point to reach out more often? Whether it‚Äôs sending a text to check in on someone or planning a coffee date with an old friend, these connections enrich our lives and create shared memories that we can cherish.

### Embracing Challenges

Now, let‚Äôs not sugarcoat things‚Äîlife isn‚Äôt always sunshine and rainbows. There will be days filled with challenges and setbacks that can feel overwhelming. But here‚Äôs where embracing each new day becomes even more crucial.

I once faced a significant personal challenge that left me questioning everything‚Äîmy career path, my relationships, even my self-worth. It was during this period that I learned how important resilience is. Each day became an exercise in courage; I had to remind myself that every setback was also an opportunity for growth.

When faced with difficulties, try reframing your mindset: instead of seeing obstacles as roadblocks, view them as stepping stones toward something greater. Each challenge teaches us valuable lessons about ourselves and helps us build resilience for whatever comes next.

### Cultivating Gratitude

As we wrap up this conversation about embracing the beauty of each new day, let‚Äôs touch on gratitude once more because it truly is at the heart of this journey. Practicing gratitude doesn‚Äôt mean ignoring life‚Äôs challenges; rather, it involves acknowledging both the good and the bad while focusing on what we can learn from our experiences.

Consider starting or ending your day by reflecting on what you‚Äôre grateful for‚Äîbig or small. Maybe it was a kind word from a stranger or simply enjoying your favorite song on repeat. This practice shifts our focus away from negativity and opens our hearts to appreciation.

### Conclusion: A Daily Celebration

So here we are! As we navigate through life together, let‚Äôs commit to embracing each new day as an opportunity‚Äîa chance to celebrate existence itself. Let‚Äôs cultivate mindfulness, cherish connections, find joy in our routines, embrace challenges with resilience, and practice gratitude regularly.

Life is fleeting; every sunrise reminds us that time is precious and that we have the power to shape our experiences. So tomorrow morning when you wake up and see that beautiful dawn breaking outside your window, take a moment to breathe deeply and appreciate all that today holds for you.

Let‚Äôs celebrate this journey together! Here‚Äôs to finding beauty in every day!

I've been 200+lbs my entire life, this medicine gave me my life, confidence, and so much more back. 

I used to have bad aches and pains in my legs and lower back, never had periods, High Cholesterol, probably more I'm forgetting to name, but every single one of those things are gone/ resolved with weightloss. ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Started in January 2024 at 275lbs and today I'm at 158!!! 
I did pretty intense diet changes- 
I've never been much of a breakfast eater, so I usually just have my nonfat skinny lattee every morning, lunch I usually have a 60g protein shake, and a couple quest protein bars if I'm super hungry or fresh fruit, and for dinner have a good slice of meat with a salad/veggie , and if i had a sweet tooth i do yogurt, or more fruit...I cut pretty much all processed junk foods out, besides my morning coffee all I drink is water/ flavored water. This all sounds very difficult I'm sure, but this medicine helped me do it all. I work a pretty tough job cleaning houses so I'm extremely active, getting atleast  10,000 steps just at work daily. 

I was not  one of the people who was able to take the medicine with no diet changes and lose weight, it took a lot of trial and error figuring out what I could eat and not eat and keep losing, and then stall again and have to switch it up all over again. So if your having a tough time with losing, or stalling constantly your not alone, just keep trying your best and I promise the reward for it all is so worth it ‚ù§Ô∏è

\- I do not regularly bring it to the office/transit  
\- Not for school/traveling around in a backpack  
\- Will replace laptop+desktop (for desktop, I will have 27"" monitor, dedicated keyboard+mouse)  
\- I do photo editing, though that's mostly desktop mode  
\- I would like the idea of randomly bringing it to coffee shops or similar for random stuff or photo editing  
\- Traveling is super low right now, but may increase in future - mostly roadtrip style though?  
\- Usage is mostly casual everyday random things with specific usecase being some photo editing in laptop mode (but mostly in desktop mode).  
\- I used to be more techy, but haven't touched anything in ages. Maybe I'd experiment again with app development or some other things... but that's all just unknown right now.

My current almost-broken laptop is a Dell XPS 15 (9560). I originally had the XPS 13 for travel purposes, and ended up switching to XPS 15 when traveling decreased and needs for photo editing increased (dedicated GPU support in the XPS 15)

So, it's BASICALLY the same weight+footprint of my XPS 15... though in theory I didn't explicitly pick the XPS 15 for the 15"" screen size over the 13"". I am 100% returning+re-purchasing the laptop with 48gb RAM variant, but unsure about screen size.

I have the MBP M4 Pro 14"" sitting right here and it's honestly not too bad... I feel like I could certainly get used to it? But at the same time, why NOT get the 16"", especially since I've had the 15.6"" for so long? I don't fall at all into the category of everyone who raves about the 14 over the 16 for ""portability""... but also, I guess it is nice to simply have the smaller footprint to just carry it around, easily fit in lap, not take up so much space on a table... etc.

So has anyone already gone through this process? Yes, I'll have a larger monitor for when I really need the big screen... no, I don't absolutely need the lower weight+size as I am not transporting it daily... is the 16"" too big for casual lap use? To fit on a table at a coffee shop?

Any other deciding factors that had you choose one over the other? Besides ""I wanted small+light for transporting"" and ""I wanted 16 for the screen real estate (and I don't ever use a separate monitor)""",1,1732483234.0,macbookpro,6,1.0,False

I looked in my coat I looked in the console, I looked everywhere for a dime nickel-penny anything. I found nothing. Meanwhile, the line is held up.

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I‚Äôm looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I‚Äôm not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I‚Äôm very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person! I‚Äôm looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I‚Äôm not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn‚Äôt?) - I‚Äôm definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I‚Äôm a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I‚Äôm very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily.

I've swapped 1000s of panels at this point but have never come across something like this:

Yesterday I got a call about outlets not working in the upstairs of a house. I'm thinking, GFCI somewhere or a wire came loose from an outlet. 
Nope

After troubleshooting, here's what's going on that I'm aware of yesterday: 1 phase to neutral reads roughly 80 to 100 volts. The other phase is spiking hiring close to 180 to 140 to 180 etc. phase to phase is solid 241 not moving at all. 

The panel is a very old challenger panel. He had another electrician out there before me who told him the panel needed to be swapped but gave him a really high price. So I told him I'd swap it out because he has a young child and an infant.

Today I swap the panel out. Turn everything on and everything seemed to work for a second. Put my meter on. 1 phase was 140 the other 100.. 
Here where it gets interesting.

When a load gets drawn, 1 phase is spiking to 200 volts hot to neutral the other is sitting around 110.

The refrigerator worked or did when I left, the homeowner just messaged me that it's out and the upstairs lights are now out. When I left I only had the fridge circuit on and the 3 upstairs circuits.

My initial thought is there's a problem with the transformer from the power company. But when you kill the main breaker, the line side of the meter is steady 120 to neutral, with no load. 

When you put a load on it, it seems to jump around. Circuit upstairs flickers, the TV that is downstairs turns on but then shuts off, coffee pot turns on then cuts off. Beer/wine fridge turns on but then cuts off. All of these are different circuits.

There was obviously a kitchen remodel before the owner bought it, that most likely didn't get an inspection (wires not stapled, no 2 pole on the 12-3, 14-2 ran to the microwave etc), but I don't know for sure. 

I plugged the main fridge into a different circuit and it worked for a bit, then cut out.

Any thoughts?

1gz1hlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1gz1hlh/what_is_best_coffee_machine/,What Is Best Coffee Machine?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been on quite a journey trying to find the perfect coffee machine, and I thought I'd share my experience with you all. After months of research and testing different machines, I think I've finally cracked the code on what makes a great coffee maker.

First off, let me say that finding the best coffee machine really depends on your personal needs. I learned this the hard way after buying three different machines before finding ""the one."" But don't worry - I'll break down everything you need to know to make the right choice the first time.

For beginners, I'd strongly recommend starting with a drip coffee maker. They're user-friendly, reliable, and won't break the bank. Plus, they make consistently good coffee without much fuss. I actually found a great selection of coffee machines here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

If you're more into espresso, you might want to consider an automatic espresso machine. These bad boys can be a bit pricey, but they're worth every penny if you're serious about your morning brew. The ones with built-in grinders are especially awesome because they guarantee fresh grounds every time.

Here's what I look for in a coffee machine:
- Brewing temperature (195-205¬∞F is ideal)
- Easy cleaning process
- Durability
- Programming features
- Water filtration system

Something I've noticed is that cheaper machines tend to break down after about a year, while quality ones can last 5+ years. So it's worth investing in a good one upfront. You can check out some reliable options here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

Let's talk about maintenance real quick. No matter which machine you choose, regular cleaning is crucial. I clean mine every month with vinegar solution, and it makes a huge difference in taste and machine longevity.

One thing that really surprised me was how much the water quality affects the taste. Using filtered water made my coffee taste noticeably better, even with the same beans and machine.

For those who are always running late in the morning (like me), look for machines with programmable features. Being able to wake up to freshly brewed coffee is literally life-changing.

Price-wise, you can find decent machines anywhere from $50 to $500+. My sweet spot recommendation is around $150-200 - this gets you good quality without going overboard.

The most important thing I've learned? The best coffee machine is the one that fits your lifestyle. Whether you're a casual sipper or a coffee connoisseur, there's a perfect machine out there for you.

1gz1ekm,https://www.reddit.com/r/JonBenetRamsey/comments/1gz1ekm/investigating_the_chronological_sequence_and/,Investigating the chronological sequence and behavioral assessment.,"John, Patsy, and JonBenet attended a Christmas dinner party at Fleet and Priscilla White's house on **December 24th 1996, at 5pm**. They were just a mile from the Ramsey's residence.¬†

**At 9.30pm**, the Ramseys arrived back at home, finding JonBenet asleep in the car, so John lifted her and brought her to her bedroom. Patsy got her ready for sleep.¬†

**At 10pm**, all the people in the house, including Burke, were asleep. This was likely JonBenet's final sighting while alive.¬†

**Around midnight**, the neighbor from across the street caught sight of a loud scream and the noise of metal against concrete. ***Why did the Ramseys choose not to disclose that they also heard it?*** A different neighbor observed strange lights in the Ramsey residence. The police were not contacted by anyone.¬†

**At 5.45am on December 25th 1996**, John and Patsy woke up early to make their 7am flight to Michigan. John had a shower. Patsy's actions at that moment were uncertain; she could have been seen heading down a spiral staircase with laundry, preparing coffee, or checking on JonBenet only to discover her missing. Later, she found a 3-page ransom note downstairs on the spiral staircase. JonBenet was absent from both her room and Burke's room.

Patsy contacted the police at **5.55am** to inform them about the abduction. ***How were Patsy and John brave enough to contact the police despite the ransom note's threat to kill JonBenet if they did so?***¬†

The ransom letter was penned with a felt-tip marker. The investigators concluded that the note was written in the Ramsey's kitchen on a notepad and with a Sharpie pen discovered there. ***Typically, the ransom note is written before the kidnapper enters the house to speed up the process. It would be inefficient to write the note inside the house, as it would take longer.***¬†

I observed that JonBenet had a heart drawn on her palm, and it appeared to have been done using the same Sharpie pen mentioned in the ransom note.

Should John and Patsy understand the meaning of the message ""Victory, S.B.T.C"" in the final ransom note? They have never mentioned this. ***What is the reason for the kidnapper to write something that John and Patsy wouldn't understand?***¬†

The officer mentioned that Patsy had on new makeup and was in the same outfit from the Christmas dinner event the previous night. Individuals who plan ahead for the following day typically opt to wear freshly laundered clothes, especially when going out. ***What was the reason for her not doing so?***¬†

**Following six in the morning**, John phoned both his friends groups, the Whites and the Fernies, and requested their immediate presence. ***What is his reason for wanting them to participate? In general, parents prefer to handle this issue with the police by themselves. Maybe they want the police to be distracted by the presence of others so they don't suspect the Ramseys and potentially contaminate the crime scene by mixing up evidence.***¬†

The police did not discover any signs of a break-in. According to reports, a family friend used a cleaner to wipe and clean the kitchen counters after crime scene technicians had dusted for prints. The kidnapper's ransom note said they would contact John from 8am to 11am, but he never received the call.

Detective Arndt and Patterson showed up **at 8.10am**.¬†

**Around 10am**, John discovered the broken window in the basement but chose not to inform the authorities. Instead, he closed the window and returned upstairs after being away for approximately one hour. He later said that he had shattered the window the year before while he was locked out.¬†

**At half past ten in the morning**, Detective Arndt and Patterson closed off JonBenet's bedroom. Patterson departed. Arndt was by herself and apparently contacted headquarters for support.¬†

**At 1pm**, Detective Arndt requested John, Fleet, and Fernie to search the inside of the house for any indication of JonBenet, or any items associated with JonBenet that may have been misplaced or removed. John wasted no time in following the other two men down to the basement.

In the basement, the men discovered a shattered window with scattered small glass fragments on the ground. John admitted that he did not repair the window after breaking it. ***Did he really leave the shattered fragments on the floor for an entire year? No, I disagree! He had enough wealth to have this repaired without delay. There is definitely something fishy going on here!***

They observed a suitcase beneath the shattered window and proceeded to relocate it. John went into a basement storage area and discovered JonBenet's body. He took the duct tape off her mouth, lifted her, and brought her upstairs to the hallway. ***I am confident that most parents would yell upon discovering the body and wait for the police to arrive and investigate, considering the important evidence in that location. Still, John did not comply with this request, isn't that odd?***

Fleet White went back to the basement and retrieved the duct tape. He ought not have done that as the kidnapper's DNA may be present. It appears that they aren't giving the evidence sufficient attention. The investigator discovered a pair of blankets inside the wine cellar. Fleet informed Detective Arndt that he had unlocked the wine cellar door before inspecting the basement and finding nothing.

The Ramsey family weren't asked for an interview until the 30th of April, which was four months afterwards. They truly did have sufficient time to consider the how and what of their words.

***What was the reason for the absence of the kidnapper's DNA on the duct tape? JonBenet had a fractured skull, but surprisingly, there was no sign of blood.¬†The detectives found it odd that the ransom of $118,000 was so low considering the Ramsey family's wealth. They might have requested a million dollars.***

It's incredible how everything seems to be indicating the Ramsey family. I am absolutely certain that they did it.",3,1732482036.0,JonBenetRamsey,14,1.0,False

1gz1dg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gz1dg2/husband_and_his_family_seek_validation_from_baby/,Husband and his family seek validation from baby,"I‚Äôm worried about the way my husband and his family interact with our baby. I feel like they all seek validation from him.

My husband works from home and spends a lot of time with the baby. The issue is that he spends the time talking with the baby or holding the baby, but never really taking care of the baby. He doesn‚Äôt check the baby‚Äôs diaper, doesn‚Äôt wonder if the baby is hungry or thirsty, cold or hot, doesn‚Äôt buy baby‚Äôs clothes or check if baby has outgrown anything, doesn‚Äôt bathe baby (unless he feels FOMO about it if that makes sense - he wants to bathe the baby when he wants the experience of bathing the baby). On that note, he HATES missing even the most minor milestones. Understandable for being a parent, but problematic when part of this whole ‚Äúit‚Äôs about me not the baby‚Äù issue. He hates that he missed out on something. The kicker is that he doesn‚Äôt contribute to any of the milestones. If I fed the baby a new food and he wasn‚Äôt there to witness it, or perform-feed or whatever, he gets mad at me. I need to feed the baby, the baby needs to eat new foods, it‚Äôs not a show! He really loves the baby and he loves me, and he loves and supports me as a mother (he gives me massages, is constantly cheering me on, thanks me for what I do every day, takes care of most of the chores even though he‚Äôs the sole provider and works all day long, checks if I‚Äôm comfortable and happy throughout the day, makes me tea and coffee throughout the day, etc). He‚Äôs not a bad man by any means! 

This all made sense when I saw how his parents interacted with the baby. When my baby cries in their arms, they all act like the baby is personally rejecting them and that the baby does not like/love them. Whenever the baby smiles at them, they turn it into a whole thing. ‚ÄúThe baby is smiling at ME, but not X‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe baby loves ME‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe baby misses ME‚Äù. If the baby is moody: ‚ÄúThe baby forgot who I am‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe baby needs to see me every day so they don‚Äôt forget ME‚Äù. Just like the baby‚Äôs dad, they don‚Äôt check diaper, bathe (unless baby‚Äôs grandma wants to bathe for their enjoyment), see if baby‚Äôs hungry, etc. I understand that he learned to ‚Äúlove‚Äù this way from his parents. 

In comparison, my family (who are also obsessed with the baby) understand that love does not work this way. When I stay over and hand over the baby in the mornings (I breastfeed and wake up several times at night to feed), I wake up to a fed (solids and water), bathed, changed baby. When my baby started showing a preference for me over anyone, I feel like they were very mature about it. I could tell it made them a little sad (especially as we live in different parts of the country and they don‚Äôt see baby often), but what comes out of their mouth is ‚Äúbaby loves mama, what a beautiful thing!‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt want to keep exposing my child to this kind of love. I told my husband about this but I am worried it may be too fundamental to change. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? ",1,1732481954.0,Parenting,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm married to my high school sweetheart and am seven months pregnant with our first baby.

I had a strange childhood, to say the least. I had two kind parents and an older brother (34M) and sister (31F). My parents are very successful financially and so I always went to the best schools and had all the material things I needed. My childhood would have been perfect, had it not been for my mom‚Äôs creepy brother. He lived nearby, and was a great uncle on the surface. However, he sexually abused me from ages 7 to 12, and was quite manipulative and successful at keeping me quiet. For example, he told me I‚Äôd get in trouble if my parents found out and even threatened to hurt my older sister if I told anyone about the abuse.

My senior year of high school, my older sister had a breakdown and was hospitalized because she was having suicidal thoughts. She told my parents that she was molested by our uncle and that she couldn‚Äôt get the terrible memories out of her head. My parents sat me down and asked if I had been abused, and I came clean about what happened. After the word got out, some of my female cousins said they were also abused. The police were called and my uncle was eventually convicted of possessing and distributing illicit images of children. It‚Äôs a long story, but he pleaded guilty to the charges involving the images in exchange for the molestation charges being dropped. Although coming forward was a horrible experience, I do feel lucky that my parents believed us and also paid for us to go to therapy to work through the trauma.

My sister and I have handled the abuse completely differently. My sister is very vocal about what happened to her and always says that the abuse has shaped her as a person. She‚Äôs now a prosecutor and (admirably) has made it her life‚Äôs mission to protect kids who are abused. 

I, on the other hand, am very private about what happened to me. Outside of my family and best friend, my husband is the only person I‚Äôve spoken to about the abuse. I hate talking about it because I‚Äôm fearful people will view me differently or that they‚Äôll worry unnecessarily. I truly just want to move past what happened and not let it define my life or relationships.

However, since my sister has been so vocal
about what happened in our family, a lot of people close to her know what happened to me. For example, she wrote about our family‚Äôs story in her law school admissions essay and has confided in her husband and friends. A few years ago, I told my sister that I don‚Äôt want to prevent her from sharing her story, but I don‚Äôt like that so many people know I‚Äôm an SA victim. I know she feels guilty and blames herself for my abuse since she waited so long to tell my parents and I was exposed to a predator in the meantime. I‚Äôve assured her that I don‚Äôt blame her, but I know the guilt is still there, so I don‚Äôt mind her taking about my abuse with her husband and closest friends. However, I‚Äôve asked her to be selective in the people she shares with, and my sister has agreed to stop telling others that I was abused when she shares her story.

My mom threw me a baby shower this weekend since my husband and I would be in town for Thanksgiving (we came early to celebrate). The baby shower was yesterday, and I had a great time. My sister was emotional for most of the afternoon and was telling everyone that I‚Äôm going to be a great mom. I thought it was sweet at the time.

This morning, I got a call from my MIL asking to meet me for coffee. When I got there, my MIL was in tears. She told me she was having a conversation with my sister at the baby shower, and she asked my sister if it‚Äôs hard to do the work she does as a mother. My sister said it‚Äôs hard but it‚Äôs something she‚Äôs always wanted to do and proceeded to share her story with my MIL. My MIL asked if I was exposed to the uncle, and my sister said everyone in my family was. She asked if he abused me, and my sister said it‚Äôs my ‚Äústory to tell.‚Äù My MIL said I didn‚Äôt have to share, but mentioned she‚Äôs worried about me and wants to know that I‚Äôm okay. I told my MIL that I was also a victim, but she doesn‚Äôt need to worry since I‚Äôve gone to therapy and have worked through it. I told her I don‚Äôt like talking about it because I don‚Äôt want that experience to define me or for anyone to worry about me unnecessarily. 

The issue is that my MIL is a total ‚Äúfixer.‚Äù She‚Äôs a nurse and naturally helps people in her career, but I‚Äôve noticed she also befriends people who are going through difficult times. For example, one of her new friends is in the middle of a divorce and another recently lost her daughter to cancer. When I told my husband about the conversation with my MIL, he warned me that his mom is going to want to take me under her wing now that she knows about my trauma. About an hour ago, a card and a bouquet of roses arrived at my parents house for me. I know my MIL means well, but the sympathy and attention is my worst nightmare, and her reaction is the exact reason why I don‚Äôt talk about the abuse.

I called my sister and asked why she thought it was appropriate to share our history sexual abuse with my MIL at my baby shower. My sister said she only shared her story, and I was the one who decided to tell my MIL I was also molested. I said that while my sister didn‚Äôt technically say I was abused, it was obvious when my MIL asked and my sister said it wasn‚Äôt her story to share.  My sister said that she didn‚Äôt know how to answer my MIL‚Äôs question and didn‚Äôt want to lie, and so it was the only thing she could think of at the time. I said she didn‚Äôt need to raise the abuse at all with MY in-laws and said it wouldn‚Äôt kill her to avoid talking about it with people who are close to me. This made my sister angry, and she said she can share her story with whoever she wants and she won‚Äôt be shamed into keeping quiet by anyone. I said it‚Äôs not about me trying to silence her, but about her having some respect for my feelings and privacy around my inner-circle. 

My sister accused me of being in denial and wanting to pretend the abuse never happened. I said I‚Äôm not in denial, but I also don‚Äôt want sympathy and attention because of what happened to me. I said that I don‚Äôt want to make the abuse part of my identity because I want people to see me for who I am now. My sister asked if I was accusing of her making the abuse part of her identity, and I said yes, since she couldn‚Äôt even go one afternoon without letting someone know why she‚Äôs a prosecutor and wants to protect kids. My sister hung up the phone in tears.

My mom is upset and says I owe my sister an apology. She says that my sister has been through a lot and it‚Äôs admirable that she uses her abuse as motivation to help other kids. I agree, but I still don‚Äôt know why she needed to share with my MIL. AITAH???  ",4,1732481668.0,AITAH,14,0.75,False

She believed in spanking and was the 'because I said so' type of parent. She's from the baby boomer generation, so that was common for that time I suppose.

She wasn't good with emotional support or affection because of trauma from abuse she received from her parents as a child.

She was busy a lot and when I wanted her to play with me or wanted to talk to her she would dismiss me often because she was in the middle of something. Which I understood but I was disappointed of course that she was always so busy.

She had occasional mood swings, yelling and snapping at my sister and I, sometimes at the smallest things or mistakes we made, which sometimes scared us.

Every once an awhile I resented her for those things. 

But I'm grown up now and she doesn't verbally abuse me anymore and is better about being emotionally supportive, like when she wants me to talk about my day and open up to her about that.

But I feel so irritable whenever she does want me to open up to her and I keep telling her to leave me alone.

 Which I feel guilty for because I know she did the best she could based on what she knew and she is now trying to help because deep down I know she cares and loves me.

I wonder if I'm just a jerk or if I have a reason to be annoyed whenever she does normal human things like yawn and sip her coffee lol.

Giving me a set on the flop for a double-up after UTG shoves. That put me almost at the middle of the field with 71 BB. I began to sharpen up as my coffee started to kick in. It's amazing how a big pot can re-energize you, especially after skating on thin ice for about six levels.

By the L8 break, I was sitting 1,391/3,573 with 59 BB, and made sigh of relief as I made coffee #2. What I hate most about playing online, and when I'm not at my sharpest, is hitting the call button when I meant to hit the fold button. Mind you, I have hit some Easter eggs when that's happened but usually it's just throwing money away. The other way can be painful if you mistakenly fold but would have hit the nuts on the river ... which would have quadrupled you up. Still better than throwing money away.

I got my first bounty on L10 with a 10-9 off. Picked up a nice pot two hands later with the exact same hand followed by 10-7 suited putting me in the top 1% at 367.¬† I'm feeling good but then the next BB hand AQ loses 15 BB to an 88 shove from the small blind and drops me back to 676 of 2,955. Another bad play with JC7C and I'm spiraling out of control now sitting about midfield with 40BB. I hate being in the bottom half. I think playing to close to the edge of my range messed me up earlier.

After that, I was up and down more often than a hooker's head in a trucker's lap.

Just before the break, ducks on the button gave me my second bounty, sadly from a fellow Canuck that shoved. My hero call gave me a set on the flop. His A5O never had a chance.

Another break rolls around and I'm 913/2,473 on L13. With 1,000 paid positions I remain hopeful on cashing.

The thing I love most about playing well is that it garners respect. Unfortunately, it can go to your head ending up in stupid mistakes.

I (29m) had made a post on r/lifeadvice a few weeks back saying how I really find my female coworker attractive. We get along great and have tons of things in common from hobbies to views on life. We have hung out a few times outside of work. The first time was with another male coworker having drinks. The second time was with just her at a coffee shop. Third time was with a bunch of coworkers. This third time we hung out, she drove me which I really appreciated. When we left the event, she told me she likes another coworker and was wanting to ask him out. I figured at that moment it‚Äôs now or never. So, I told her how I felt about her. She let me down in a very sweet way and we were talking about it when she was taking me back to my car. From what she‚Äôs told me about what she looks for in a guy, he doesn‚Äôt really match what she looks for, but things can happen and change. I then kind of called her bluff and said ‚Äúyou should ask him out to dinner. I‚Äôm sure he will say yes. He‚Äôs a really cool and sweet guy.‚Äù She hesitated and said no with little explanation as to why. Well, I get home that night as she texted me to make sure I made it home safe. Going back a bit to that same night, I jokingly told her I would take her out for lunch and a day to just hangout and left it at that. She giggled and said sure. Not thinking anything more of it or not even really meaning it, I left it at that. Well, fast forward a few days later, she texted me early in the morning and asked if I still wanted to hangout. Not having anything else to do that day, I said sure. I went to go pick her up and we had a great day and talked a lot. At one point she went back to the night where we were out with our coworkers and she said she was saying weird stuff due to the drinks she had. She had one drink as did I. We then went shopping and I was helping her pick out clothes for her niece. She then asked me if I ever want kids one day. I told her yes and her face lit up, but nothing more. I have also met her family and they really seem to like me. At that time, we were at her house after work, watching tv and chilling with her dogs. That night, I was helping her bake a cake and talking with her family. It was a great night. The whole reason for this post is I am wondering if she really meant liking the other coworker or just trying to gauge my reaction? I am getting so many mixed signals and I really like her a lot.

Keto pastries had me hooked and I did binge on them. I lost weight but the Keto sweets were making me live for the weekends when I could eat pastries. During the week I did regular Keto. I went Carnivore and the binges and cravings were gone and I'm in the best shape of my life. Last July I tried a Keto pastry thinking my sweet taste addiction was under control but nope. I binged. So I said, never again.

And so it was. Until today ‚òπÔ∏è

I've been going through a huge financial struggle. I'm super afraid of poverty, we were very, very poor after my dad's death and I had to step up and work to rescue my mom and brother. I was 17. They worked right alongside me to be able to leave the tiny room one of our relatives me let us sleep in so we wouldn't be homeless. We managed to build a life. Twenty years later we were doing well.

But the loss of my brother's job and one year of unemployment has left me with no savings. And I have to pay my rent and his so he and mom don't end up on the street.

Things are so dire (we believe in God and we pray but man... Hard.) that I believe the cravings have come back. When my dad died it was the same. I ate my emotions.

I usually eat eggs and ground beef but three days ago I ate a little over 3000 calories in eggs and beef and cheese (which I can't afford). And then I had some coffee with cream and Stevia, (I had given up Stevia the same time as I started carnivore because it fuels my sweet taste cravings).

I think I lost my last ten pounds when I quit Stevia and sucralose. Really, sweeteners make you heavier.

So I did some Stevia as I had been craving  sweetness probably because of all the stress.

I managed to eat fine for the last three days but today I caved. Because I couldn't  afford Keto pastries I bought some Cream cheese, peanut butter, cream, blueberries and Stevia and ate a huge bowl of that mixed together.

Tomorrow I'll start over with my IF until noon, beef tallow, eggs and ground beef but today I'm just looking for some hope and encouragement and clarity.

I 34/F met a guy 38/M on a dating site and we pretty much hit it off since day one.  We video chat for a few weeks and would geek out for hours on the topics video games, movies, super heroes, conspiracy theories, religion, our childhood upbringing, and many other topics.  We laughed a lot and it seemed as though we had a great connection.

What was supposed to be a coffee date turned into me staying the night sort of. By sort of I mean I ended up leaving/getting kicked out at 3am because of a nightmare he had.  I woke up to him making a makeshift pallet on his floor and when I asked him what he was doing he stated that he had a nightmare that we were being intimate and he was bleeding from somewhere, but he didn't know where.  He stated that due to that dream he knew this relationship wasn't going to work out and he really hated that because despite that dream he told me that I was his dream gir.  Feeling awkward about all this I stated ""I guess I should leave then."".  He agreed that it would be for the best. So I made the hour drive home at 3am.  I was embarrassed by the whole thing when friends would ask me how the date went.

A week went by and he contacted me through the site we met on stating that he wanted to see me again.  I told him no because of the way he acted.  He asked for my number again so that we could talk.  He apologized for how he acted and that he was tired and has been out of the dating game for awhile so he didn't know what else to do when he wasn't getting any sleep (apparently I snore some).  I told him I wasn't sure about giving him another chance because of how rude he was the first time.  He told me to think about it because he really did like me and he hated the idea of losing a chance to see where we could go.

A couple weeks later we got together for another date at his place.  We rented a movie, geeked out in our usual way, and held each other.  The next morning I asked if he had any nightmares, if I snored, or if there were any other mishaps.  He stated that it all went well and cuddled up to me more.  We spent a few hours talking, kissing, and enjoying each other's company before I left.

When I got home I noticed I lost a piece of jewelry and I informed him of it and he ended up finding it there.  I text him the next day asking if he would like to hang out at my place the coming up weekend.  He never replied but I seen that he was reading my messages.  I got busy with work and on Friday I called him up to ask what his deal was and he told me that I he found be to be beautiful, smart, funny, super chill, and the fact that I was a nerd made me the package deal to him, but he couldn't seem to get feelings for me any deeperr than physical.  

So we agreed that I would pick up my jewelry that Saturday and go our separate ways.  When I got there we talked for a bit in his apartment hallway and then he invited me in.  When in his place it was like things went back to the usual.  He held me between the wall and him, gave me gentle kisses, pressed our foreheads together, and other romantic gestures.  

I was pathetic enough that I agreed to break-up s**.  It was just as good as the other 2 times that we slept together.  During the deed he kept saying things like ""God you're just so perfect."".  I told him not to say that to me during break-up s** because it just sent too many confusing signals.  He looked hurt when I told him to stop that but didn't say anything more about me during that time.

When I was leaving I asked if he was absolutely sure and he said yet again that I was perfect for him in every way, but he was stuck on just the physical attraction.  I told him that's fine and I'll accept his response, but he is not to contact me again to tell me that he regrets it.  He looked hurt and said something a long the lines of ""Well, maybe we can talk a bit more to see if feelings happen and casually date."". I asked him if he was actually going to contact me at all and he said that he really didn't like texting.  I reminded him that he could just call like usual.  He just looked at me as though he was thinking and I stated ""Don't worry about it."". He made some statement about maybe contacting me in 3 months or so and I told him that I didn't deserve rhat kind of treatment.  He either wanted me or he didn't and at that point I made it very clear that he was to not contact me in any way. He looked exceedingly hurt and I just left because I really don't think there was much else to say.

I find myself attracted to her and want to ask her out, but I am not sure how. All the women I have been with were either people I knew in person or dating apps. I have never ever approached a woman in public before. 

It's not necessarily that I am too shy, but I'm afraid I might be too direct. I asked a few female friends here and they threatened physical violence if I go with my initial plan of ""Hey, I think you're cute, wanna grab a drink?"". It seems my German bluntness would not be appreciated. 

I'm a very calm person in real life, not pushy at all. Hence I figured I would just go up to her and say that I find her attractive, that I would love to grab a drink/coffee with her and that if she is okay with it, I'd give her my number and she can decide if she wants to follow up on it.

Also, he yelled at me after for being upset and said I was blowing things out of proportion.

What do I do? ,"Hey, I don't really make these? I'm not sure the etiquette on here but l'm kinda at a loss. My siblings have told me to give him a few more days but I really just don't want to interact with this guy anymore, any bubbling feelings of interest have been completely killed.

For context, I met this guy on bumble (a dating app) and we seemed to hit it off well enough. Our conversations mostly consisted of me hyping him up in a (I assume) jokey way. E.g. he says he's the swaggest person in the world and I say ""yea man you're so cool"".

This was charming enough for me and it helped pad the conversation enough. It was a breath of fresh air after several dry matches with people terrible at conversation. Anyway. We decided to watch a series together for our first call as a kind of half date since we live 50 odd miles away from one another.

The call was. So awkward. He just kept talking through the entire thing, and I couldn't really watch anything at all. My computer was lagging super bad too, so the show wasn't even synced up very well.

And then, of course, the piss thing. I mentioned offahandedly that I was a bit of a weird kid (trying to comfort him about something I think) because I used to chew the coffee table (I was like, 4-5) he then immediately responded with the fact he used to piss on his wall as a kid. He did not say how old he was or how long this went on for, and honestly I do not want to know. I felt so awkward and uncomfortable for the rest of the call, and took an out as soon as I could without hurting his feelings.

I'm basically already clocked out to any potential relationship with this guy now, even though I found him super charming at the start. I feel like a massive dick for getting so immediately uninterested though, considering we've been texting pretty consistently for the past few days and l've talked to my siblings about him. I'm also super new to the dating scene, and don't really know how these things normally go, or how people normally handle stuff like this?

He's been texting me a bunch now since the call, sending ""I love spending time with you"" TikTok's and asking for another call sometime. Do I ghost him? Do I give him a few more days like my siblings say I should? If I don‚Äôt, How do I explain that I'm not interested? I don't know what the kindest thing to do is here

Really thrown me through a loop. Any advice is appreciated.

Earlier this year, I was put on medication to treat an autoimmune disorder. Unfortunately, 4 months into treatment I had a severe reaction to the medication that landed me in hospital. Afterwards, my GP signed me off for 12 weeks while I recover. 

The length of the leave is not an issue - I am part of a union and as per my contract am entitled to up to 6 months of fully paid sick leave after 5 years of service - but I am starting to go stir-crazy after the first 4 weeks of being isolated at home. I would like to go into town to buy some winter clothes (which I need) and meet a friend for coffee, or stream a game on Twitch with my friends for an hour, but I am worried about whether there may be any consequences at work should a colleague see me and report it to management.

The reason for my leave is legitimate - the medication has induced terrible fatigue (I need to sleep upwards of 14 hours a day just to function) and visual disturbances that prevent me from being able to look at screens for longer than an hour or two a day without severely affecting my vision - and fully backed up by my doctor should my work choose to call the surgery to verify, but I am still uneasy. 

Would my employer be legally allowed to discipline me/retaliate upon my return if someone saw me running a necessary errand outside while on legitimate long-term sick leave, or if they were to spot me chatting/streaming a game for an hour on Twitch?

It‚Äôs just me and my husband at home- no kids. She is a very flirty person which does not bother me in the slightest. But yesterday morning we were all waking up hungover. My husband was making coffee and I asked him to bring her my hair dryer. He did. I heard nothing for like 5 whole minutes and was laying in our bed across the house. I started to call his name bc I was going to ask him something and he did not answer. I got up looked in the kitchen, dining, laundry rooms and he was not there. While all this is happening the house was completely silent. I walked to the two guest bedrooms in a little hall where there is also a bathroom. He was not in the one we use for an office or in the bathroom. I was like why would he be hanging out in her room when I know she took a shower.
All of a sudden he walks out coming from the side of the bed she is standing at. He wiped  his lips and they both acted fucking weird. She immediately was like he was just bringing me the blow dryer- even though I know he already done that. They claim he heard a noise and thought she fell so he popped in to check on her.  Then was he all the way in the room walking away from the side of the bed she was standing on in nothing but a towel?
I was like what is going and he acted super guilty the rest of the day. Well if he was just checking on her why was there silence?
Why would they act so weird- today he said he felt guilty because he was staring at her in her towel.

I need some guidance bc I kind of feel like they are gas lighting me. Am I crazy? I just felt it in my heart that they were doing something.
