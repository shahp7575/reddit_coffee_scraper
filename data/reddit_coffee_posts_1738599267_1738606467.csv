I was thinking a french-pressed, cold-brew coffee would be a good place to start?

Didn't say anything mean to anyone. Nothing. I ""DID"" absolutely fucking nothing wrong. I even cleaned things that don't normally get any attention because i was burying myself under any busy work i could find to avoid interacting with other people because i was aware that i was really upset. But I was visibly upset and that was unacceptable. I'm fucking tired of this and it needs to change. Not that it matters to me anymore. I've had it and I'm leaving the work force altogether.  Fuck you, you don't want my help. It's never enough that i don't direct anything at anyone or say mean things to anyone or break anything. That's never enough. Having the feelings i didn't ask for at all is just unacceptable.  Do it yourself, then. 

But seriously, stop demanding people pretend they're ok when they're not. For fuck's sake fascism just realized itself in America. Nobody is fucking ok right now. Your fucking business will be just fine if i don't pretend I'm high on fucking life while an authoritarian is actively destroying what little democracy we had left. 

And if you're a customer; STOP FUCKING COMPLAINING ABOUT UNHAPPY BARISTAS. If nobody said anything rude to you, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT. Shut the fuck up. From the bottom of my heart, shut the fuck up. 

Anyway, yeah, I'm fucking done. I've left the community altogether and everyone that thinks it's ok to fire someone for being visibly upset who otherwise did nothing wrong can eat shit and be alone when they die. Unless they're an introvert. Then i hope they're surrounded by doctors and nurses they've never met. And a rush limbaugh impersonator because fuck it, i really fucking hate you for this and i just think you deserve the worst for it. Seriously, from the bottom of my heart, fuck you if you think this is ok.

1igvgn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1igvgn9/new_to_adhd/,New to adhd,"New official diagnoses but not new to the concept lol. I got diagnosed with ADHD about two weeks ago. I started by just increasing my antidepressant a little bit and that has made me feel a little bit better at times but then worse at times as well. I am very nervous about starting 5mg of adhd medication tomorrow because I am so nervous it will make my anxiety worse, but I know it could also help so I'm willing to try it. I find that I have all the typical symptoms of adhd, i literally can't start anything (I need to be job searching right now but I find that I can't sit down to do the work), I also have low motivation in social settings and even on things that I don't need to do but wish I did more of ( cleaning, crochet, etc.). Right now I work in food service and I need a lot of coffee and other stuff to keep myself focused and motivated for short period of time. I also find that when I have down time, I can't get enough satisfaction out of anything. I feel bored with watching tv, doing my crochet or anything. I try my other stimulating stuff to subside this feeling but now it doesn't help it just makes me sick. I think that the stimulant may really help but I'm super scared I will have a panic attack, does anyone have any advice?

1igvfge,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1igvfge/strange_gastric_issues_with_no_answers_looking/,Strange gastric issues with no answers - looking for suggestions before I lose my mind!,"Demographic: 34F, 5'10"", 150#, white, never smoked, haven't drank in years, no recreational drugs.

Quick major medical history: No longer have any sexual reproductive organs (planned sterilization), DTGA correction when I was born. Otherwise have been fit, active, and healthy. Family history of hiatal hernias, lupus, and hypothyroidism. Genetic marker present for Hashimoto's. Mother has Hashi's.

Medications: 0.8mL estradiol cypionate, subq, injected weekly, 40mg esomeprazole daily, 200mg progesterone nightly, probiotics and multivitamins daily.

Complaint: Starting about two years ago, I noticed that I was unable to drink coffee, alcohol, or soda without major acid reflux, so I quit consuming both. In the last year, I noticed that anything spicy was beginning to cause major issues. In the last 6 months, things escalated greatly to the point where I'm on an extremely strict diet, lest I end back up in the ER! Anything fatty, greasy, spicy, acidic, heavy, or whatever my body hates that day, seems to cause me a range of issues, such as gastric bloating, difficulty breathing due to pressure in chest cavity from stomach, globus sensation, nausea, loss of balance, brain fog, chest pains, heart arrhythmia (PVC's), RUQ and LUQ pain, and lots of mucus that seems to be consistent, especially after eating anything. I also appear to get PVC's when I'm nearing a bowel movement - we're talking being unable to sit at a 90-degree angle because I can't take full breaths and PVC's start firing off, then I have a BM and it's like the symptoms all stop immediately. The reflux was also getting so bad at times that it would come up freely all day, I'd wake up wanting to throw up, had sore throats despite sleeping elevated, my teeth started to erode, and I've needed supplementary dental work to mitigate that.

Food triggers: I noticed that a lot of different foods like milk, tomatoes, garlic, onions, anything fatty, oat milk, etc... all caused me a great deal amount of pain in my LUQ and RUQ regions and heart arrhythmia would usually follow, to the point where I can't even eat a small amount of those foods without feeling miserable. Most of the symptoms start 2-3 hours after eating, but things like tomatoes and milk cause more immediate reactions.

Tests: I've been to the ER a few times when it was at its worst (unable to breath, chest pains, globus sensation, tightening feeling around throat, etc...) - I was initially assumed to be having heart issues or allergic reactions the last few times, but that's never been a thing. During the last visit, they tested everything they could think of because I had been there a few times with similar symptoms, so I'll list out what I can:

* EKG: Overall fine, though I did have a minor T-wave inversion that they attributed to an electrolyte imbalance.
* Echo: Heart is structurally great and ""the best it's been in years"" when compared to the last 10 years of echo's I've had.
* 72-hour Holter monitor: PVC burden was only around 0.1% and seemed to show flare-ups roughly 3 hours after me eating anything. The rest of the ectopic beats were negligible and normal for any healthy person.
* Barium swallow test: No issues overall seen, aside from some slower motility near the LES.
* Endoscopy: Picture perfect. No h. pylori, no hernia detected, no celiac sprue, no intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia, no eosinophils
* CT scan: Nothing remarkable found, no blockages, no lymph node swelling, etc...
* Xray - Nothing remarkable found
* Thyroid Ultrasound: No swelling or nodes present
* Gallbladder Ultrasound: One 4mm polyp found, no other indication of gallbladder issues
* Blood tests: CBC showed slightly low WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, but that's been my norm for 5+ years and is just barely at the low end of the reference ranges. Celiac antibody test came back negative. TSH test came back 10+ during my ER visit but has since lowered to around 3-3.5. T3/T4 is always on the low end for reference, usually around 0.7 or so. Thyroid antibodies didn't appear to be present. CMP looked fantastic overall except for the anion gap being a tad high, which again pointed to an electrolyte issue with the T-wave. All vital minerals and nutrients were good overall, minus the issue with the electrolytes for that one visit. Lipase, procalcitonin, D-Dimer, NT PRO BNP, troponin was all perfectly normal.
* Urine Analysis: Everything looked perfect - nothing out of reference.

Notes: At this point, they're running out of things to test and I'm otherwise a perfectly healthy person on paper, yet I'm unable to eat most foods without either pain or falling asleep afterwards (looking at you, gluten). The gastro has decided it's a generic IBS diagnosis and said to go on an IBS-friendly diet with a low histamine producing probiotic. The probiotic he suggested appears to be making a difference - I will say that. I've had far less PVC's and swelling over the last month, so I'm continuing with that because it was suggested that my issues might be an overgrowth of high histamine bacteria, but he couldn't confirm or deny that because he didn't test for it.

The issue is I've been on a low FODMAP diet for the last few months (before he suggested it), and although it's helped, I'm finding that I'm still slowly losing foods. For instance, I could have low fat dairy, then I had to go to no-fat dairy, now I can't have ANY dairy without major pain and swelling. I used to be able to do oat milk but that became painful over time. Almond milk has been my go-to, but I'm noticing as of late, I can't do that anymore... and it's becoming rough on me mentally to slowly feel like my already-restricted food choices are becoming more restricted. At this point, I'm gluten free and dairy free, plus I'm finding that anything high in fructan appears to be a major trigger.

My PCP has been sending me to every specialist she can think of because she's not content with a generic IBS diagnosis, but we're running out of specialists. The only thing we haven't tried is meeting with an endo to see if my thyroid is to blame despite it technically being within normal reference ranges, or if I have some type of autoimmune issue. She doesn't think it's the issue, but my gastro said the thyroid could be influencing some of these issues. We're also waiting on a HIDA scan to be completed because she said she can't 100% rule out the gallbladder yet and has seen patients like me before where only the HIDA scan will show biliary dyskinesia. Aside from that, I'm beginning to draw blanks.

I just want to get my life back in order and be able to eat something without feeling like I can't breathe... I want to have energy after eating instead of struggling to stay awake... I want the chest pains, PVC's, and random aches/pains to not happen simply because I ate something that wasn't just salted... I'm tired of having to eat boiled (unflavored) chicken and white rice every week...",1,1738605782.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I ran LFR the week before WoD was set to release and the staff dropped for my mage... I remember thinking ""wow that felt good"". That was the end of MoP and I joined a random guild at the beginning of WoD. 

WoD dropped and I had my Macbook air on my lap, fans maxed out, screen tearing, third degree burns on my thighs... but I was a happy boy. The guild I joined was progging normal raid and I had no idea what I was doing but I was having fun and showed up to every raid on time. The guild/raid leader was our loot council, he would determine who would get every drop. About three weeks into raid I was late for the first time, they started without me and I joined on the second boss. I thought no issues right. A set of wrists dropped and the guild leader saw that no other clothies needed it, besides me. This was when my WoW career derailed. Now, I was excited because I knew no one else needed those and I was excited for an upgrade. This was when I got a whisper from the guild leader telling me that because I was late to the raid I was not going to receive the item. My protesting did not prevail. They disenchanted the normal cloth wrists and my love for the game quickly died. Told the guild what happened in guild chat, told the guild leader off, quit game and didn't go back for a long time.

Fast-forward to Shadowlands, a lot has changed in my life. I had an okay gaming PC (GTX 970 lmao), I was moved out with my GF. COVID hit and quickly I was bored. I learned a few of my IRL buddies were in a guild and they were planning to raid heroic. So, I purchased Shadowlands and dug in. This is the beginning of where my love for this game began. This guild was nice, they taught me how to play the game, they introduced me to iceyveins, wowhead, parsing. I quickly fell in love with smacking a training dummy trying to perfect my rotation for hours. I played fire mage back then and I think we can all remember how good they were during Castle Nathria, although I hear not as broken as they were at the end of BFA lol. Anyways, I quickly outgrew the heroic raiding that we were doing. This was where my guild leader introduced my to a guild which was running for CE. With heartfelt goodbyes my old team wished my luck on my new endeavour and my new team (this wasn't a forever goodbye as I still played with them though lol). Anyways, we just missed CE in Castle Nathria and moved onto the raids to follow. I loved the min-maxing, the parse chasing, the progging, the grinding. But... as it often does, life had other plans.

My wife and I had a baby. I quickly found that I had no time or energy to play WoW like I once did. I quit about halfway through Sepulcher of the First Ones raid. However, this longing to play never ceased. Couple years went by, a new house, another baby, a MAN was born (this man was me if you can't follow lol).

With the intoduction of delves I thought, hmm this is a way for me to gear up a character without worrying about time commitments or lengthy raid/dungeon sessions. I decided that I would be fine with not min/maxing and wanted to try to enjoy the game I was played for what it was. I slowly went through the story, experienced the game for what it was, found all the small items throughout the world, began mount farming, transmog farming. My passion had reignited for the game and I was able to do it at my own pace. Up until this point I had one main character, a mage, and a couple others that I would do mount runs with. But I wanted to try out other classes. I challenged myself with leveling all classes to 80. 

This morning I logged into my lvl 46 druid, planning to lvl them up. I logged in and I was sitting infront of The Eye. I initially flew away thinking lets go power up baby. But I stopped... I turned around and thought ""eh lets just give it a go"". AND BOYS, I WAS NOT READY FOR WHAT WAS FORTHCOMING.

Listening to Kael'thas thinking man, this raid would have been sick to be apart of and BOOM. I SEE IT, I SEE THOSE THREE WORDS I HAVE BEEN LONGING TO SEE, THAT MOUNT THAT I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD GET, A CHECKMARK ON MY WOW BUCKETLIST. 

ASHES          OF       ALAR.

I jumped from my chair, spilt my coffee, sacked myself to check if I was dreaming. I wasn't. Sprinted as fast as I could out of the dungeon and mounted up. Euphoria rained over me and it was good. 

I appreciate those who read everything, I apologize if you felt like I wasted your time lol but I am just so happy and wanted to share my journey with everyone. This mount only took me 15 runs to get and at first I felt like I cheated the system as I have seen how long its taken some people to get this but I also think it could be karma for what happened to me by my first guild. Either way I am happy and wish that everyone can enjoy this game like I do. I have the screenshot of the number of attempts but don't know how to upload multiple pics in a post. 

Cheers everyone and al diel shala.

You know that feeling when office work (or remote work) starts sucking the life out of you? Every day feels the same, your focus is shot, and even your coffee isn’t doing its job anymore? Yeah… that was me.

At first, I thought I just needed a new routine. Maybe a fancy planner or some productivity hacks. Spoiler: *none of that worked.* My workspace was the real problem, it was dull, lifeless, and honestly, **killing my vibe.** I even started questioning if working from home was the dream I thought it would be.

**I want to share how I turned my dull remote work life into a hilarious yet focused work experience.**

One day, in a desperate attempt to make my workspace *less soul-crushing*, I stumbled upon a weird yet intriguing idea: funny desk accessories. I wasn’t expecting much, but I bought a few things first, *The Butt Tape Dispenser*, yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like, and yes, it makes me laugh every time I use it. Second, I got a camera lens mug that confuses every single person on Zoom with a real camera lens. That small investment in laughter made a HUGE difference. I was **enjoying** it (okay, maybe not *all* of it, but way more than before).

That’s when I had a thought, there’s got to be so many other people out there stuck in the same boring, soul-draining work situation. So, I did something about it.

I’ve had two comments removed for “toxic nationalism” in the past few weeks. In the first, I mentioned that Colombians likely wouldn’t be thrilled with the president rejecting the military plane carrying migrants because it would result in higher prices. While I can see a viewpoint that this is a comment mocking the Colombian people (although I disagree, and it certainly wasnt intended that way), I’ve seen numerous comments laughing about Americans receiving their comeuppance by voting for Trump, who will enact policies that will raise prices and worsen quality of life for his voters. What exactly is the difference between these types of comment, other than mine wasn’t directed at Americans? 

For example, this recent chain discusses people hoping that the UAW workers get fired due to fallback from Trump’s policies:

This thread, in the same post as my deleted comment, mocks Americans for likely facing higher coffee prices due to the tariffs:

https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/K4xYGdsLT5

This commenter said that they hope that Trump’s policies hurt the people that voted for him. The rest of the thread follows suit:

https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/YW8k4wAz0c

I also just had a comment removed for stating that while I don’t agree with the US’s approach to Panama, (I) it’s probably for the best that they cut ties with China considering the strategic importance of the canal to the Americas and (ii) that i am hopeful that the Panamanian president’s desire to have closer ties with the US (including more US investment in Panamanian infrastructure) comes to fruition.

I live in a mostly white town and I'm the only black guy here with a gap. so if one of us does or says anyone all anyone needs to say is ""it was the black guy with..."" And the whole town knows who it is. 

So everyday I go out, looking around. Saying this and that so people can't talk about me because if they do they start shit about themselves. And it's tiring. It's so damn tiring. One slip and you're done.

I also know what he is talking about was that same dude went out one night for ONE drink then went home. Then a white woman said he SA her only for her to get sent to jail the next day for making the same fake SA report to multiple men trying to get her boyfriend to get jealous

Ain't no where on this earth I can just be in peace. 

My heave WAS the middle East because after you find out all that three wives slave stuff is mostly bs they are cool people. But now there's a war there and I can't even go to the one place where the only think I got to watch out for is scams and that's easily avoid by saying fuck off. 

I just want a day I can walk around and not be black or any other race. I just want to be human. I don't want to watch out all day. Watching my words, where I go,

Nothing but a rich collection of dirt, weeds and tall grasses that stretch all the way to the trees.

But every now and then, when the moon is just right, and when the air is so cold it hurts to breathe—the **house** appears at night.

It’s always the same: a dark, 19th-century Victorian mansion, complete with spires and enormous windows, the kind of place you would never see out here in the boonies.

I had trouble believing it was real the first time .

One of my college-mates played a prank and gave me a cookie which was a potent edible. I was up all night at home, waiting for the unexpected high to pass. That’s when I first noticed the **house,** fully built, standing some odd thirty yards away.

It was quite an experience, seeing a magical haunted mansion while thoroughly tripping. I thought it was just the THC playing tricks on me, but by the time I sobered up around 4:00 AM…  the **house** was still there. 

It was too real to be a hallucination, and too vivid to be a trick of the light. 

I took pictures on my phone from the living room, bathroom and even the balcony. The **house** was a real structure. A real, creepy, pitch black-looking abode that gave an indisputable bad vibe. And then as soon as dawn broke, it faded away.

Over breakfast, I explained to my grandma what I had seen, and even showed her photos. But she waved away all my “nonsense”.

“Ain’t been anythin’ there for sixty years,” she would say. “Don’t conjure what isn’t.”

I brought it up a few more times, but grandma would always shut it down. “We’re the only ones that live on this road, Robert. Don’t be ridiculous. Are you on drugs?”

\*\*\*

Maybe I was just ‘on drugs’. The **house** didn’t reappear any night after that, so I went back to focusing on school. The whole reason I moved out to live with Grandma was because her place was only an hour-long bus ride to college.

But then came another evening when I stayed up late finishing an essay. When I went to grab some juice from the fridge, I saw it peering from the large kitchen window. 

The **house**. It was back.

This time it appeared much more *alive* than before. A glowing fuchsia color shined out from its innards, and there appeared to be movement behind its windows.

I knew I wasn’t tripping again because I was writing my schoolwork. I was sober AF. Closing my laptop, I excitedly unboxed some binoculars.

That’s how I saw the *shadows inside.* 

It was way too dark to make out anything past silhouettes, but I definitely saw the tops of heads and shoulders pass by the windows and settle in various spots in the **house.** They moved with a casual, low-key energy, as if everyone was worn out but still awake. Restless.

*Who were these people? And how were they inside this* *place*?

Then my attention turned to the trees ruffling behind the **house**—where a tall figure emerged from the woods. 

An immediate knot tied itself in my stomach. I had never seen anything like this person. He wore a velvet-looking frock, above an embroidered vest, and waist high trousers, which were all somehow tailor-made to fit his *eight-foot long arms and legs.*

He moved like some anthropoid stick bug, shuffling and ambling, often using one of his long arms as another leg.  Eventually this bizarre 19th century aristocrat spider hunched over the door, took a glance at me and raised his arm.

I wanted to turn away, but I couldn’t. I was frozen. The figure’s hollow eyes, even from that distance, felt like they were staring directly at me.

His skeletal fingers made the “come hither” motion. He recognized my fascination.

He knew I was being drawn to the **house.** 

He knew I was watching.

He knew  … I wanted a deeper peek.

\*\*\*

The next morning, my grandma handed me a letter in a brown envelope with no return address. She said it must have come from my parents.

I opened the letter and knew right away that it didn’t.

There was only a single piece of parchment inside, withered and worn. In thick black ink, only two words were written in very old cursive: *You’re Invited.*

“Where did you get this letter?”

“Where do you think?” My grandma poured herself coffee. The mailbox.”

“Who dropped it off?”

“Who do you think?” My grandma burnt her lips on the coffee. “The mailman.”

“The mailman? You saw him?”

“Jesus Christ, Robert. Yes, the mailman. He comes every morning ‘round eight when there’s mail. How do you think mail works? Are you on drugs?”

Full disclosure: back with my parents, I did go through a phase where I was smoking a lot of pot. They told my grandma there would be zero tolerance if I was ever caught blazing. They threatened with military school, community service, etc. 

(So I’ve been careful only to blaze on the school grounds. Never near grandma’s.)

“No grandma, I was just wondering about the letter is all.”

“Nothing else to wonder about. Now eat your breakfast.”

\*\*\*

That night, after grams went to bed, I played some Civ 6 to pass the time, eagerly awaiting midnight.

Every ten minutes I’d check to see if that empty lot sprouted anything. But It stayed empty. By about 12:30 AM, the **house** still hadn’t arrived and I was disappointed.

In a last ditch effort, I put on several layers and brought one of my secret blunts with me. The first night I had seen the mansion when I was accidentally high, so I figured it couldn’t hurt to smoke a little now and see what would happen. 

After quietly closing the front door, I walked several feet away to make sure the light in grandma’s room was still off.

It was. She was sleeping.

With utmost secrecy, I brought the blunt and lighter to my lips—when a chill wind snuffed out the flame. My fingers went cold, my stomach formed a knot.

The **house** had returned.

And this time it was standing closer than ever before, barely three car lengths separated my grandma’s place from its front doors.

It’s like it was presenting itself.

I walked toward it, driven by an impulse I couldn’t explain. The air was thick, almost electric. I just *had* to take a peek.

The normally untamed weeds and bushes were now suddenly pruned and lining a cobblestone path toward the **house**. I walked along the polished granite pieces until I reached the first wooden step. My heart slowed.

The shadows inside seemed to shift, like something was moving toward the door. I inched backward ever so slightly, keeping my eyes on the knob.

A figure—tall and thin, like the one I’d seen before—stepped behind the frosted glass. Within moments, the front door swung open and his strange limbs came clambering beneath the wooden frame. The second I made eye contact, I met the strangest, most disarming smile I've ever seen in my entire life

For a moment, it felt like I had known this man for a long time, like this guy was the uncle I used to visit each year… only I knew that couldn’t be true. 

The smile had some kind of aura. Something that emanated a fake nostalgia. I couldn’t really put it in words when it was happening but I am telling you now in retrospect—this guy had a powerful charm in between his gleaming teeth.

“My boy! My lad! It would appear as though you have accepted my invitation! Yes indeed!” The 19th century aristocrat spidered over to me at a somewhat alarming speed.

“Please, allow me to introduce myself, I am Reginald Beddingfield Hollows, Esquire —the proprietor of this fine estate.” His left hand effortlessly brushed the ceiling of the awning high above us. ""And you my lad, simply *must* come inside, we have been dying to meet you! The demand is insatiable, my good boy.”

Inching away, I responded in a hushed tone. “Uh… *Who’s* been dying to meet me?”

“Your friends! Inside the **house**!” He tried to follow my gaze. “They all know you dear lad, they’ve been watching you for a long time! Come in! Come in!”

I could hear faint voices coming from deeper inside, it did kind of sound like a low-key **house** party. Somebody was delicately playing the piano.

“Umm… can I think about it?”

“Think about it?” Reginald laughed a perfectly pitched, high society laugh. “What’s there to think about my boy? You’ve already accepted by arriving at my doorstep. You *want* to come in!”

My stomach was tensing up into some kind of triple knot, I was finding it hard to walk backwards.

“In fact, it would be quite rude *not* to come in. Quite rude indeed. ” Reginald’s smile slowly dissipated. “Especially after all the effort we put in. Today was going to be *your* night, Robert, They’re all going to be *so* disappointed.”

*How did he know my name?*

Like some kind of flexible insect, he scooped his head down low to meet my line of sight. His teeth beamed at me with a glossy shimmer. “You *want* to come in, Robert, we both know that. It’ll be fun.”

Although I could feel my stomach contort itself further, an immense feeling of trust also breezed through my chest. It’s like this was the five hundredth time I’ve met Reginald.

“It’ll be fun?”

“Riotous, Robert! A fête in your honour! A feast! A dance! The string quartet has been practicing for ages!”

Again, that feeling of trust. I went from being merely tipsy, to fully drunk on Reginald’s nostalgia magic. His arm lightly rested on my back, guiding me through the front doors.

I entered the **house.** 

The air was cold. Freezing, in fact. I could see my breath in the dim light. The flickering purple glow came from several gas-lit sconces on the ceiling. The walls seemed to stretch and warp, like the **house** wasn’t quite real. Like it was bending around me, enclosing me.

I wasn’t alone either. Figures moved in the shadows, their forms indistinct, their heads tilted in my direction. They looked human, but just barely. They watching me without blinking, staring with wide eyes.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to run. But I couldn’t. All the walls and doors bended away from my touch. It felt like the **house** had a grip on my very soul, like it was pulling me deeper into its endless corridors.

One of the figures stepped forward—a girl, also about my age, her face was pale and stretched like a mask. She wore clothes that may have been in fashion about twenty years ago.

“You don’t belong out there anymore,” she said softly, his voice almost tender. “You belong here now. You’re one of us now.”

It was a mistake to step inside. Once you’ve seen what’s behind those purple-lit windows, there’s no escaping.

The **house** never lets you go.

\*\*\*

I’ve had loads of time trapped in this **house** where nothing changes. 

I don’t get hungry. 

I don’t get sleepy. 

The police can’t see the **house**, and they’ve blocked me for calling them too many times with my “wild stories”.

My phone has been permanently stuck at 23 percent battery for god knows how long. Time doesn't seem to exist here. Only warping corridors and college kids who all say the same thing.

“I came out here to live with grandma. It was only an hour long bus-ride to school.”

Across one of the ever-shifting hallways I once discovered a painting of my “grandma” wearing the same kind of aristocratic clothing as Reginald. She stared out with the same passive face. Those same disinterested eyes.

I’ve typed this story out on my phone, searching for help. I wish I could tell you where to look, but I have no idea where I am, the windows stretch away from me.

If you ever see a mansion that only appears at night, and you come across a tall, spidery man that looks like Reginald, tell him that you are inviting me, *Robert,* to come outside.

I believe there might be some kind of magic in the use of invitation. Some kind of sanctuary. At least I hope so. It’s my only chance of escape.

If someone who reads this *does* find a way to free me from this limbo, I promise you my everlasting thanks.

I am planning a family road trip to the Grand Canyon and will be driving through Nebraska on the way.  Based on our sleep needs, we will need to spend a night at a hotel somewhere on the western side of Nebraska.  We plan to go to a city in Colorado the next day (Denver or Boulder are possibilities, but mostly we just want pretty sights and walking around with coffee).  Trying to keep this as a relatively low cost vacation.  

Where would you suggest for staying in Western Nebraska.  Any sights or landmarks you recommend?

Nothing but a rich collection of dirt, weeds and tall grasses that stretch all the way to the trees.

But every now and then, when the moon is just right, and when the air is so cold it hurts to breathe—the **house** appears at night.

It’s always the same: a dark, 19th-century Victorian mansion, complete with spires and enormous windows, the kind of place you would never see out here in the boonies.

I had trouble believing it was real the first time .

One of my college-mates played a prank and gave me a cookie which was a potent edible. I was up all night at home, waiting for the unexpected high to pass. That’s when I first noticed the **house,** fully built, standing some odd thirty yards away.

It was quite an experience, seeing a magical haunted mansion while thoroughly tripping. I thought it was just the THC playing tricks on me, but by the time I sobered up around 4:00 AM…  the **house** was still there. 

It was too real to be a hallucination, and too vivid to be a trick of the light. 

I took pictures on my phone from the living room, bathroom and even the balcony. The **house** was a real structure. A real, creepy, pitch black-looking abode that gave an indisputable bad vibe. And then as soon as dawn broke, it faded away.

Over breakfast, I explained to my grandma what I had seen, and even showed her photos. But she waved away all my “nonsense”.

“Ain’t been anythin’ there for sixty years,” she would say. “Don’t conjure what isn’t.”

I brought it up a few more times, but grandma would always shut it down. “We’re the only ones that live on this road, Robert. Don’t be ridiculous. Are you on drugs?”

\*\*\*

Maybe I was just ‘on drugs’. The **house** didn’t reappear any night after that, so I went back to focusing on school. The whole reason I moved out to live with Grandma was because her place was only an hour-long bus ride to college.

But then came another evening when I stayed up late finishing an essay. When I went to grab some juice from the fridge, I saw it peering from the large kitchen window. 

The **house**. It was back.

This time it appeared much more *alive* than before. A glowing fuchsia color shined out from its innards, and there appeared to be movement behind its windows.

I knew I wasn’t tripping again because I was writing my schoolwork. I was sober AF. Closing my laptop, I excitedly unboxed some binoculars.

That’s how I saw the *shadows inside.* 

It was way too dark to make out anything past silhouettes, but I definitely saw the tops of heads and shoulders pass by the windows and settle in various spots in the **house.** They moved with a casual, low-key energy, as if everyone was worn out but still awake. Restless.

*Who were these people? And how were they inside this* *place*?

Then my attention turned to the trees ruffling behind the **house**—where a tall figure emerged from the woods. 

An immediate knot tied itself in my stomach. I had never seen anything like this person. He wore a velvet-looking frock, above an embroidered vest, and waist high trousers, which were all somehow tailor-made to fit his *eight-foot long arms and legs.*

He moved like some anthropoid stick bug, shuffling and ambling, often using one of his long arms as another leg.  Eventually this bizarre 19th century aristocrat spider hunched over the door, took a glance at me and raised his arm.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to run. But I couldn’t. All the walls and doors bended away from my touch. It felt like the **house** had a grip on my very soul, like it was pulling me deeper into its endless corridors.

One of the figures stepped forward—a girl, also about my age, her face was pale and stretched like a mask. She wore clothes that may have been in fashion about twenty years ago.

It was a mistake to step inside. Once you’ve seen what’s behind those purple-lit windows, there’s no escaping.

The **house** never lets you go.

\*\*\*

I’ve had loads of time trapped in this **house** where nothing changes. 

I don’t get hungry. 

I don’t get sleepy. 

The police can’t see the **house**, and they’ve blocked me for calling them too many times with my “wild stories”.

My phone has been permanently stuck at 23 percent battery for god knows how long. Time doesn't seem to exist here. Only warping corridors and college kids who all say the same thing.

“I came out here to live with grandma. It was only an hour long bus-ride to school.”

Across one of the ever-shifting hallways I once discovered a painting of my “grandma” wearing the same kind of aristocratic clothing as Reginald. She stared out with the same passive face. Those same disinterested eyes.

I’ve typed this story out on my phone, searching for help. I wish I could tell you where to look, but I have no idea where I am, the windows stretch away from me.

Nothing but a rich collection of dirt, weeds and tall grasses that stretch all the way to the trees.

But every now and then, when the moon is just right, and when the air is so cold it hurts to breathe—the **house** appears at night.

It’s always the same: a dark, 19th-century Victorian mansion, complete with spires and enormous windows, the kind of place you would never see out here in the boonies.

I had trouble believing it was real the first time .

One of my college-mates played a prank and gave me a cookie which was a potent edible. I was up all night at home, waiting for the unexpected high to pass. That’s when I first noticed the **house,** fully built, standing some odd thirty yards away.

It was quite an experience, seeing a magical haunted mansion while thoroughly tripping. I thought it was just the THC playing tricks on me, but by the time I sobered up around 4:00 AM…  the **house** was still there. 

It was too real to be a hallucination, and too vivid to be a trick of the light. 

I took pictures on my phone from the living room, bathroom and even the balcony. The **house** was a real structure. A real, creepy, pitch black-looking abode that gave an indisputable bad vibe. And then as soon as dawn broke, it faded away.

Over breakfast, I explained to my grandma what I had seen, and even showed her photos. But she waved away all my “nonsense”.

“Ain’t been anythin’ there for sixty years,” she would say. “Don’t conjure what isn’t.”

I brought it up a few more times, but grandma would always shut it down. “We’re the only ones that live on this road, Robert. Don’t be ridiculous. Are you on drugs?”

\*\*\*

Maybe I was just ‘on drugs’. The **house** didn’t reappear any night after that, so I went back to focusing on school. The whole reason I moved out to live with Grandma was because her place was only an hour-long bus ride to college.

But then came another evening when I stayed up late finishing an essay. When I went to grab some juice from the fridge, I saw it peering from the large kitchen window. 

The **house**. It was back.

This time it appeared much more *alive* than before. A glowing fuchsia color shined out from its innards, and there appeared to be movement behind its windows.

I knew I wasn’t tripping again because I was writing my schoolwork. I was sober AF. Closing my laptop, I excitedly unboxed some binoculars.

That’s how I saw the *shadows inside.* 

It was way too dark to make out anything past silhouettes, but I definitely saw the tops of heads and shoulders pass by the windows and settle in various spots in the **house.** They moved with a casual, low-key energy, as if everyone was worn out but still awake. Restless.

*Who were these people? And how were they inside this* *place*?

Then my attention turned to the trees ruffling behind the **house**—where a tall figure emerged from the woods. 

An immediate knot tied itself in my stomach. I had never seen anything like this person. He wore a velvet-looking frock, above an embroidered vest, and waist high trousers, which were all somehow tailor-made to fit his *eight-foot long arms and legs.*

He moved like some anthropoid stick bug, shuffling and ambling, often using one of his long arms as another leg.  Eventually this bizarre 19th century aristocrat spider hunched over the door, took a glance at me and raised his arm.

I wanted to turn away, but I couldn’t. I was frozen. The figure’s hollow eyes, even from that distance, felt like they were staring directly at me.

His skeletal fingers made the “come hither” motion. He recognized my fascination.

He knew I was being drawn to the **house.** 

He knew I was watching.

He knew  … I wanted a deeper peek.

\*\*\*

The next morning, my grandma handed me a letter in a brown envelope with no return address. She said it must have come from my parents.

I opened the letter and knew right away that it didn’t.

There was only a single piece of parchment inside, withered and worn. In thick black ink, only two words were written in very old cursive: *You’re Invited.*

“Where did you get this letter?”

“Where do you think?” My grandma poured herself coffee. The mailbox.”

“Who dropped it off?”

“Who do you think?” My grandma burnt her lips on the coffee. “The mailman.”

“The mailman? You saw him?”

“Jesus Christ, Robert. Yes, the mailman. He comes every morning ‘round eight when there’s mail. How do you think mail works? Are you on drugs?”

Full disclosure: back with my parents, I did go through a phase where I was smoking a lot of pot. They told my grandma there would be zero tolerance if I was ever caught blazing. They threatened with military school, community service, etc. 

(So I’ve been careful only to blaze on the school grounds. Never near grandma’s.)

“No grandma, I was just wondering about the letter is all.”

“Nothing else to wonder about. Now eat your breakfast.”

\*\*\*

That night, after grams went to bed, I played some Civ 6 to pass the time, eagerly awaiting midnight.

Every ten minutes I’d check to see if that empty lot sprouted anything. But It stayed empty. By about 12:30 AM, the **house** still hadn’t arrived and I was disappointed.

In a last ditch effort, I put on several layers and brought one of my secret blunts with me. The first night I had seen the mansion when I was accidentally high, so I figured it couldn’t hurt to smoke a little now and see what would happen. 

After quietly closing the front door, I walked several feet away to make sure the light in grandma’s room was still off.

It was. She was sleeping.

With utmost secrecy, I brought the blunt and lighter to my lips—when a chill wind snuffed out the flame. My fingers went cold, my stomach formed a knot.

The **house** had returned.

And this time it was standing closer than ever before, barely three car lengths separated my grandma’s place from its front doors.

It’s like it was presenting itself.

I walked toward it, driven by an impulse I couldn’t explain. The air was thick, almost electric. I just *had* to take a peek.

The normally untamed weeds and bushes were now suddenly pruned and lining a cobblestone path toward the **house**. I walked along the polished granite pieces until I reached the first wooden step. My heart slowed.

The shadows inside seemed to shift, like something was moving toward the door. I inched backward ever so slightly, keeping my eyes on the knob.

A figure—tall and thin, like the one I’d seen before—stepped behind the frosted glass. Within moments, the front door swung open and his strange limbs came clambering beneath the wooden frame. The second I made eye contact, I met the strangest, most disarming smile I've ever seen in my entire life

For a moment, it felt like I had known this man for a long time, like this guy was the uncle I used to visit each year… only I knew that couldn’t be true. 

The smile had some kind of aura. Something that emanated a fake nostalgia. I couldn’t really put it in words when it was happening but I am telling you now in retrospect—this guy had a powerful charm in between his gleaming teeth.

“My boy! My lad! It would appear as though you have accepted my invitation! Yes indeed!” The 19th century aristocrat spidered over to me at a somewhat alarming speed.

“Please, allow me to introduce myself, I am Reginald Beddingfield Hollows, Esquire —the proprietor of this fine estate.” His left hand effortlessly brushed the ceiling of the awning high above us. ""And you my lad, simply *must* come inside, we have been dying to meet you! The demand is insatiable, my good boy.”

Inching away, I responded in a hushed tone. “Uh… *Who’s* been dying to meet me?”

“Your friends! Inside the **house**!” He tried to follow my gaze. “They all know you dear lad, they’ve been watching you for a long time! Come in! Come in!”

I could hear faint voices coming from deeper inside, it did kind of sound like a low-key **house** party. Somebody was delicately playing the piano.

“Umm… can I think about it?”

“Think about it?” Reginald laughed a perfectly pitched, high society laugh. “What’s there to think about my boy? You’ve already accepted by arriving at my doorstep. You *want* to come in!”

My stomach was tensing up into some kind of triple knot, I was finding it hard to walk backwards.

“In fact, it would be quite rude *not* to come in. Quite rude indeed. ” Reginald’s smile slowly dissipated. “Especially after all the effort we put in. Today was going to be *your* night, Robert, They’re all going to be *so* disappointed.”

*How did he know my name?*

Like some kind of flexible insect, he scooped his head down low to meet my line of sight. His teeth beamed at me with a glossy shimmer. “You *want* to come in, Robert, we both know that. It’ll be fun.”

Although I could feel my stomach contort itself further, an immense feeling of trust also breezed through my chest. It’s like this was the five hundredth time I’ve met Reginald.

“It’ll be fun?”

“Riotous, Robert! A fête in your honour! A feast! A dance! The string quartet has been practicing for ages!”

Again, that feeling of trust. I went from being merely tipsy, to fully drunk on Reginald’s nostalgia magic. His arm lightly rested on my back, guiding me through the front doors.

I entered the **house.** 

The air was cold. Freezing, in fact. I could see my breath in the dim light. The flickering purple glow came from several gas-lit sconces on the ceiling. The walls seemed to stretch and warp, like the **house** wasn’t quite real. Like it was bending around me, enclosing me.

I wasn’t alone either. Figures moved in the shadows, their forms indistinct, their heads tilted in my direction. They looked human, but just barely. They watching me without blinking, staring with wide eyes.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to run. But I couldn’t. All the walls and doors bended away from my touch. It felt like the **house** had a grip on my very soul, like it was pulling me deeper into its endless corridors.

One of the figures stepped forward—a girl, also about my age, her face was pale and stretched like a mask. She wore clothes that may have been in fashion about twenty years ago.

“You don’t belong out there anymore,” she said softly, his voice almost tender. “You belong here now. You’re one of us now.”

It was a mistake to step inside. Once you’ve seen what’s behind those purple-lit windows, there’s no escaping.

We were of the same culture, age, etc. Most importantly, our little kids became attached at the hip. So many activities, outings, dinners together... We built our friendship, and so did our babies. Around a big holiday, we had made plans for an activity in our home, and then something a little later in the day. The night before, plans were attempted to be clarified (by said mom) all via text. I wrote out the plans once more, and nothing changed. She again, tried to confirm (adding in other options) and again, I confirmed. I asked if she was feeling anxious that night, bc it was so much back and forth I was a tad worried about her mental state. Fast forward, the day came, and we waited. I made a table full of apps, had the activities ready for all the kids, and we waited. They come in, my child was so shocked and surprised, it was so beautiful. They hugged, danced, played. As they're sitting, us parents are talking, and I offer them some appetizers. In our culture, eating is a must and it's important. She looked at me and with a smirk, said, ""honey, this is not dinner, what are you doing? Okay, we'll talk about it later."" My blood began to boil. I offered again about 30 min later ""coffee, tea, I got some cake too."" Response- same ugly smirk, and this time, with vengeance. She asked if I was okay, ""cause your texts from last night were weird."" I said, I am fine, but you tried to change the plans, when they were set from the get go... 

She then asked me to go read the messages (she's an attorney) so I walked over to get my phone and go over them with her, and she didn't like that one bit. Then, she told me ""you clearly have issues, and you're projecting them on to me."" I looked around my home, and laughed, and said I don't have any issues. But I don't appreciate your tone.

She freaks out. She yells, ""this is me, this is who I am, I'm getting very uncomfortable, with all do respect we are leaving."" I'm a southern girl at heart, and the ""with all do respect"" term isn't used in this fashion.  

At that point, I realize, this bitch is in my home, my children are playing with her kid, they're all right there in the room we're in, and...I am very pregnant. She proceeds to grab her daughter's hand, and storms out of my house. I follow her outside to not be a dick, and my beautiful little children come running out of the house on a cold winter day, crying, yelling, confused. I tell her, ""what are you doing? You're traumatizing the children."" and she says ""I don't know, I'll call you."" And they left. Mind you, it was so fucking cold, and this wack job was wearing a tank top. 

I have texts, and I fortunately live in a home that has Google everywhere, so this ordeal was recorded. 

Am I the ahole, should I move on, should I call, should I... It's now been 6 weeks, and I still fume when I think about the ugly act that she did in my home, in front of my child.

Usually to me this means it needs cleaning, so I did a descaling and clean out, the next day it was better. The day after that, it’s slow again. I tried another descaling, maybe I didn’t do it well enough the first time. Works great for a day, next day super slow again. I know it’s not the coffee grind or anything like that because even without the basket there it puts out water very slowly. Is there a way to fix this? Do I just keep trying to descale?

I need suggestions or something, I don’t even know.

I’ve been with a girl I truly love for 5 years. Let’s call her Q. I don’t even know where to start. She was a precious soul and extremely nice and understanding to me. I have a difficult character and exhibiting narcissistic qualities plus stubbornness, jealousy, getting upset easily, and saying things that were negative without thinking. I was neve like that but then 2 years into our relationship I was reminded (by my close relative) about something that happened to me when I was a kid. I became flat and less interested but always loved her. Because of that we would argue.  I started cancelling plans, laying in my bed and starring off to space for hours, and being more apathetic. I just couldn’t share my trauma much. Throughout that she’s been dealing with her PTSD due to her family and tried multiple times bringing it up to me but I was afraid to talk to her about it (I thought if I said less than it would go away) so it seemed like I was ignoring and not caring.

On top of it all, I was in contact with my ex. Let’s call her G. G has severe depression and would attempt multiple suicides frequently. I am also depressed and so is my dad so we understand. G was also alone (all family left and sister passed away from OD). I picked her up from psych wards. I would check up on her to see if she is ok over the phone and text once a day and met her over 5 years probably 10 times for coffee. Our texts were just a crap show and very stupid (such as calling each stinky and derpy). One thing to make clear is I never cheated on Q or thought of it. I had 0 feelings for my ex and so did she. It was sort of like patient to therapist relationship. Q found out about 6 weeks ago and can’t forgive me for it. I’m so devastated as I was getting out of my PTSD, wanted to propose, and severely was working on my bad qualities. 

I want Q back so bad but I met with her and talked about it (explaining everything) but she said if she will be with me, she would hate herself for it. She said she can’t trust me anymore. She ended our relationship and was very stern on it (which I’ve never seen in her before). She’s been always forgiving and reasonable. 

That kicked me into unimaginable sadness. I started working out, setting goals, and want to become an RN as Q always wanted me to be. Q is in process becoming an RN (taking her boards). I did therapy and treat everyone better. I’m not the same person I was even yesterday. My drive came back and I am accomplishing things like I never have before

If you were in my situation, what would you do? Are there any experts on here that can help me or had a similar situation? I thought of G calling Q (which she would do for me) and telling her that there was absolutely nothing between us. I only talked great about Q to everyone and how amazing she was. I so want her to forgive me. I thought of things like “confessions” in shared notes where I explain in more depth to her about the instances how I did her wrong and how I acknowledge that and value it. I am afraid of texting her b/c I might get no reply. I thought of buying her a trip to Japan (where she always wanted to go) or a concert which she would love to go to. My other thought was to tell her that no matter what happens to her (illnesses or other problems), I will always be there.

We have so many things tied together. Hand crafted gifts, worked together, music, shared notes of plans and many more. Everywhere I go I see some part of her. 

What can I do if anything? Do you think any of my ideas will help? Should I call or text her? I’m extremely heartbroken and can only see myself with her. Has anyone been in a similar situation and was able to do something about it? I don’t know how to start if I call her, besides the fact that I understand how much pain I caused her. Can someone please suggest something to me so she can take me back and trust me again? Or what can I say to earn that trust? 

Sorry for the long read, I apologize in advance and thank you for all of the suggestions. Appreciate it.

What should I do?,"I've (F 50s) been married for over twenty five years and my husband (M 50s) has had several affairs over that time period, though none in the past five or six years as far as I know. We completed counseling last year and it was very helpful. As a result, I thought we were entering a new era. We committed to full transparency as a way of rebuilding trust, along with me deciding to be more present for him.
The most recent affair from 5 or 6 years ago (to my knowledge) lasted over a year, and included some degree of communication even after I found out about the affair and he supposedly stopped. This signaled to me that he did not want to really give her up. However eventually he did so. Fast forward to this past September, when apparently he ran into her coincidentally, and they arranged a meet up at a coffee shop a week or so later. I just found out about all of this today and I am livid, because it means that he is not in fact being transparent. I found out about it because I saw that a person from her company searched my social media profile. That started a conversation where it came out that he had talked to her and seen her several months ago. 
At this point I feel like there is no hope in terms of me ever, truly being able to trust him. I don't believe anything happened during their meetup (in fact, he said that she now has a serious boyfriend), but it is the lack of transparency about running into her followed by the unfortunate decision to meet up with her that are very telling to me. I don't want to be divorced but at the same time I don't know if I can continue to try to build something with the person I can't trust. At my age, I want to find someone I can be with for another twenty years who is trustworthy and I don't want to waste more time hanging on to relationship that probably won't work out because of a lack of trust.

“Demina…?” It had to be. She was responding to his directives!

*// This time with feeling, Father…*

*}*

*\`\`\`*

Jin-woo sat there in shock. Staring at the singular line of code. Warmth surged in his entire body.

The system shuddered, reality flickering like a bad video connection. Pain lanced through Jin-woo's digital consciousness, but he maintained his focus. Each small victory felt like pulling a thread from an unraveling sweater, necessary but potentially catastrophic if done too quickly.

He had help, one that was far more advanced than his own human mind. This was no longer the impossible race that he knew it could have been. Together, if his suspicion was right, they would defeat this code cancer. His baby had grown into an adult.

Jin-woo laughed like a madman. His eyes, wild and insane. Smile, it hurt to show so many teeth at once.

Hours bled together in Jin-woo's consciousness as he battled the corruption line by line. A second intelligence translating his proper functions into a language and code he wouldn’t have been able to decipher if he spent a lifetime on. The alien mathematics of the system’s code continued to evolve in ways that would have made his old PhD advisors either weep with joy or retire on the spot. And Demina was making it look trivial. It had learned and grown, but somehow connected to him.

Another surge of warnings and corrupted code appeared but was quickly quarantined and destroyed as necessary. He wrestled with another corruption cluster that seemed to be attempting to rewrite pi as a letter of the alphabet. It made his mind spin thinking on how a singular letter could carry so much meaning. How would they even use it in a regular sen–

“Focus,” he commanded himself. “Can’t lollygag when Demina is trying her hardest.” A certain amount of parental pride surged in his chest. This was his baby showing it could be a contributing part of society! Even if that society only included the two of them.

*\`\`\`*

*SYSTEM\_INTEGRITY\_CHECK:*

*base\_reality\_matrix {*

*quantum\_probability = ∏(n=1 to ∞)\[sin²(θ) + cos²(θ)\] where*

*θ = arctan(∞/0) \* √(i\^2 + 1)*

*stability\_constant = lim\[x→∞\](1 + 1/x)\^x \* ∮(μ₀/4π)*

*// Is math supposed to scream?*

*}*

*\`\`\`*

""No, Demina,” he answered. “Math is not supposed to scream.” At least where he had come from it didn’t.

The corruption responded by trying to divide by zero in seventeen different dimensions simultaneously. Jin-woo's consciousness fragmented briefly, his existence pixelating like a graphics card having an existential crisis. That one nearly broke through his near mechanical drive and lack of mental damage. He huddled closer to himself trying to keep all the bits and pieces together, before he re-stabilized.

He felt the overwhelming urge to throw everything he could think of at the wall of corruption and hope it worked, but fought it off. His mind spun in disorientation.

*Focus*! *Remember the lab. Remember what happens when you rush.* He allowed the nightmare of destruction to drive him forward. There was no room for mistakes.

Memory fragments flickered through his processed emotions: Jennifer's face as another quick fix failed, Michael's warnings about system stability, Kali's knowing looks when he dismissed their concerns. The pain felt distant now, digitized, but the lessons remained razor-sharp.

He constructed another quarantine protocol. This time it was designed to prevent any corrupted code from growing, killing its momentum wherever the quarantine reached. Again, Demina did her part and extrapolated his work. The level of mathematics and formula was beyond him, in a language he couldn’t have understood if he studied for a thousand years. It was simply beyond him. There was no chance for his success had Demina not involved herself in his continued existence.

*\`\`\`*

*implement\_stability\_matrix {*

*for each (reality\_segment in quantum\_array) {*

*establish\_boundary\_conditions {*

*field\_strength = ∮∮(E • dA) = Q/ϵ₀*

*temporal\_anchor = ∫\[0→∞\](x\^n \* e\^(-ax))dx = n!/a\^(n+1)*

*stability\_constant = ∏(p prime)\[1/(1-p\^(-s))\]*

*}*

*if (corruption\_detected) {*

*quarantine\_protocol {*

*barrier = exp(iπ) + 1 = 0*

*containment = ∑(n=0 to ∞)\[(-1)\^n/(2n+1)\]*

*// Don't dissipate your code. It was lonely.*

*}*

*}*

*}*

*}*

*\`\`\`*

To his surprise it worked like a charm. The corrupted segment stabilized, its wild mathematical anomalies settling into something approaching normal behavior. Or at least as normal as anything could be in a reality where pi occasionally tried to identify as the square root of banana. And that somehow fit and worked within the scope of the larger structure of the system, the same structure he wasn’t allowed to touch or adjust in any way, shape, or form by his SystemArchitect ability.

""Finally,"" he breathed, watching the success cascade through connected systems. ""I'm pretty sure I just violated several laws of physics. And possibly a few local ordinances."" He joked with Demina, knowing that somehow she heard him, even if she couldn’t respond.

The victory, small as it was, rekindled something in his processed emotions, a determination that felt familiar despite its digital translation. It was the same drive that had pushed him through countless debugging sessions in his old life, the stubborn refusal to let impossible problems remain unsolved. Including the motivation Demina gave him with her plea of ‘not dissipating’, he could have done this years on end.

*Some things don't change, even when reality decides to rewrite itself as interpretive dance.*

The system hummed around him, temporarily stable but still harboring corruption in its deeper layers. Jin-woo knew this was just the beginning, there were more battles ahead, more impossible mathematics to wrangle, more reality to debug. But for now, he had proven something important: even in this strange new existence, he could still do what he did best, fix things that shouldn't be fixable.

*I really wouldn't mind if the next reality I end up in comes with better error messages. And maybe a virtual coffee maker.*

1iguydv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1iguydv/i_think_my_husband_is_gaslighting_our_son/,I think my husband is gaslighting our son.,"My husband is very much a narcissist. We’ve been together for 10 years now and I have been through all kinds of emotional trauma with him. I’m at the point where I have started calling him out on his ish, but he very much still just defends his actions and isn’t fully willing to admit he’s doing anything wrong. 

I have tried to leave him on several occasions, so he knows he’s on thin ice and he’s putting up a big front on how he wants to be here for his family and be a better husband and father. But he’s still very much not willing to change anything except his excuses. 

Well, our oldest is now 9 years old and he is very much aware that things are not fair between us. He sees how my husband doesn’t help around the house at all, makes me do everything, and complains when things aren’t done. He’s commented to me many times and he’s I think done with it too to the point where he’s started calling his dad fat and lazy, and telling him when he’s being mean. Please keep in mind I have not once talked about his father this way. I try really hard not to talk badly about him, but I also don’t defend his actions. If he asks why his father always makes me go out to get him drinks, rather than going to get them himself, I always simply reply, “I don’t know”, because I’m trying really hard not to defend his actions or talk bad about him to our son. 

Well last Thursday my son made several comments about how I have been in such a good mood lately when it’s just been me and the kids. He had several days off school because of snow days so we spent a lot of time together, and yes, I’ve been happy and silly and having fun. I’ve also been working on some home renovations, and I had some help come over to watch my daughter while I worked. I got a lot done and I felt happy and accomplished, and when my son got home from school he noticed I was happy and we spent some time together having fun. Then my husband got home from work and he asked me if I had finished the renovations. I told him what I had finished, but the room is not yet complete and he went off about how he was expecting it to be done and I’ve had too much help so it should be done by now and he doesn’t understand why it’s taking so long, etc. While he was going off my son jumped in and yelled at him. He said that I was in such a good mood and he ruined it and I’m not in a good mood anymore. My husband tried to justify it saying that he was just trying to talk and get information, so I cut him off to defend my son and told him that what he was doing was coming home and yes, changing the mood. Instead of asking questions he decided to go off and berate me, and our son noticed. He apologized and told our son that he didn’t mean it and didn’t realize he was doing it, and thanked him for correcting him. He told our son that he doesn’t always know better, so it’s okay if he jumps in to correct him and that if he notices mommy’s mood changing he’s allowed to stand up for me. I wanted to correct him and tell him that it’s not the child’s job to parent the parent’s behaviour, but I just left it because I didn’t want to fight anymore in front of our son. 

Well, fast forward to today, my husband gets up and starts asking me to go get him some energy drinks. He always asks me to go out when he wants something and usually I do say no, but he persists until it annoys me or until I snap at him, and then he makes me feel really bad and guilty for not going AND for being mean about it. Today though my son chimed in and told him to stop and that I always go and it’s not fair and if he wants something he should go and get it himself. My husband tried to defend himself by saying “I just thought she would want to go out to get herself a coffee, and then since she’s already out…” but my son cut him off again saying no, it’s not fair to always ask her and never do anything for yourself and to just be lazy all the time. My husband snapped back and told him that he needs to just stay out of it and he’s the child and shouldn’t be getting involved in adult affairs. 

Is this gaslighting? Telling our son he should step in to correct his behaviour and then snapping at him and telling him not to get involved when he does. 

I’ve been trying really hard to recognize when he does it to me, but I’ve never seen him do it to our son before. At least not that I can recall or have recorded. What can I do about it? 

I am in the process of trying to save up and gather my affairs, but with an infant and no job (yet) it’s a slow process, so for now we’re stuck here. But even when we do leave, he’s going to want shared or partial custody and I’m worried about what this behaviour will do to my son even on a part time basis. It’s not healthy and our son doesn’t deserve this trauma. I was okay with this process taking time when it only affects me, but now that it’s coming down on my son too, I’m really worried.

Average level of fitness, no medications, no prior medical issues. I’ve smoked in the past, mostly infrequently but one or two months were 1-2 cigarettes a day. I use a CPAP (most days) for UARS (upper airway resistance syndrome) which helps me breathe better at night, get better night’s sleep. I started using the CPAP 2 months ago, and overall symptoms started 8-10 months ago.

I have two issues that go hand in hand: the urgency caused by bladder irritation and the subsequent gagging caused by the bladder urgency. 
I’ll start on my issues with urgency. Around 8 months ago I developed bladder urgency which I believe was partially caused (or exacerbated) by caffeine/nicotine (I used to take nic pouches and infrequently smoke cigarettes). I now cannot drink coffee or have nicotine without bladder irritation flaring up, where it feels like I need to pee very badly even when there’s nothing to pee out. I’ve cut out caffeine/nicotine, and it’s at least a little less miserable. 

I took a urinalysis and urine culture, it was all negative on the urinalysis and no culture found, so no UTI. I also doubt it’d be a STD, but I haven’t tested for it. I also tested for prostatitis, but my measurements came in at the normal range. Around the same time the issues came, I also had made the poor decision to take a low-to-regular dose of oral SARMS, for around 1 month. I don’t want to rule it out as a potential cause, because of the proximity of the time period, but it didn’t seem to cause instant bladder irritation. I’m drinking more water now which helps the irritation but also makes me pee more, it feels like a “pick your poison” kind of situation. When I’m sitting slouched for a while I have a slight suspicious this also makes my irritation worse, but not sure. One more detail, my sister also has problems with bladder urgency, so it could be a genetic predisposition, however she doesn’t have the same gagging issues, it’s not as bad for her.

So, not only is the bladder urgency slightly miserable, but when it feels urgent I also start gagging. It’s happened when I have to defecate as well, but on seldom cases. Whenever I gag I feel a slight dizziness. These days it feels like the slight dizziness stays nearly all day. It’s miserable and also embarrassing to gag in front of others on a roadtrip and request a bathroom stop. I’ve heard of some people tying an overactive gag reflex to sleep-breathing related issues like sleep apnea, not sure if this is connected to me though. 

Can anyone help point me in the right direction, please? My doctor said she had no idea and their office won’t even refer me to a urologist without “additional visits” that cost so much money. Even if I went to a urologist I fear having to pay lots of money for no answer at all. I appreciate you all, thank you so much.",8,1738604650.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

My story starts in the beginning of May. I was driving to Costco and I had a feeling of fullness drinking my coffee. It was right under the ribs. I think this is the epigastric area. Correct me if I’m wrong. I went to a walk in clinic after I had a mammogram. I did tell the mammogram assistant that I have been experiencing pain especially on my left side. She assured me if they saw anything that they would do an ultrasound. Was given the clear. But the pain was too much so I went to the walk in clinic and the doctor told me I had muscle strain. Told me to take some OTC back pain medication. It didn’t really help as I still had pain under my ribs that came and went. I went to emergency with this pain and was given an ECG. All was good and I was sent home. I did numerous heart tests for my pain. Once again I went to emergency with severe pain mostly on the left side under the ribs. The doctor on call did bloodwork and my lipase was 60. The range was 22-51. He sent me home and told me to come back for an ultrasound the next morning. So I did and he couldn’t see anything wrong with any of my organs and the radiologist said it probably was  the start of an ulcer. So I was sent home all the time still experiencing pain sometimes it hurt so bad I thought I was going to pass out. Went to emergency a month or so later and this time my lipase was 64.  The doctor wanted to do an ultrasound but I told him I had one done a couple of months ago and needed a CT.

We are all skeptical when buying warranty, they always seem fishy. I asked all the questions and seemed fine. I can visit any subaru dealer or shop for that matter, but I get a free loaner if I use a dealer. 
Yesterday I discovered a tire pressure light on, turns out I have a bad sensor. My sales guys specifically told me tire sensors are covered. 
I called my local dealer to set up an appointment, why not take advantage of my warranty? 
The service lady told me I'd be charged $175/hr for diagnostics, on top of the $100 dollar deductible. I about spat out my coffee! 
I did buy the car at a different dealer but assumed all played by the same rules. I advised her that I was never told about any fees aside from the deductible. She was like ""yeah, sorry but that's what we have to charge"". So that would he $275 for a stupid $40 sensor?!?! 
Of course i canceled the appointment and called the dealer I purchased from. They told me there is no diagnostic fee, all I'll pay is the deductible. 
Why am I not surprised? The $275 price was also the dealer that quoted me $840 for a 30k maintenance. When the dealer I bought it from charged me $400. 

I read an older post where a tech said they'll charge for the diag but will waive if if the repair is done there. The lady i spoke to said, I'd be paying regardless. Needless to say, I won't be using thst dealer for anything. I'll drive the 40 miles to the other one. ",1,1738604433.0,subaru,2,1.0,False

1igupgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1igupgp/seeking_legal_advice_to_challenge_building/,"Seeking legal advice to challenge building management company for not resolving issue of nesting birds. England, UK.","This is a long one, so apologies, and it’s a bit of a disgusting topic about bird poop! This has been an ongoing issue for several years with communication back and forth, so I’ve tried to make it as easy to understand the chronology as possible…

I own an apartment in the North West of England which I have lived in since March 2019. There is a company who is responsible for managing and maintaining the building, dealing with any repairs and issues, etc. and everyone pays fees for this as well as for any maintenance work.

I live on the 3rd floor (top floor) and have a Juliet balcony with a set of glass double doors which is the main natural light source in my apartment.

I contacted the company in 2020 (lockdown year) to report birds nesting in the eaves right above my Juliet balcony. Birds were regularly pooing over my balcony which was unsightly and a bit of a nuisance to clean. Several of my neighbours were having the same issue at this time, and I was close with my next door neighbour who I know also reported the issue around the same time as me. I was informed that they were aware of the issue, and that they couldn’t act upon it whilst the birds were nesting but this would be dealt with once the birds have moved on.

I didn’t think much more about it and the birds left and I assumed it was dealt with. I’d forgotten all about it until the following year and the birds returned. The first year it was just a bit of an occasional nuisance, there was only one nest and it wasn’t too much of a pain to clean up. However the next year there were two nests and the amount of poo increased. I later learned that some sections of the building had been netted as agreed, several of my neighbours had the issue resolved, but for some reason I had been missed out and no netting was installed above my balcony.

I reported the issue again. They apologised and reassured me it would be resolved once the birds moved on. I think you can guess where this is going…

No netting was installed despite me contacting the company in September ‘21 to inform them that the birds had moved on.

The following year (2022) the birds returned and this time there were 3 or 4 nests above my balcony. Have you ever seen a car parked under a tree for a few hours, and the owner returns to find it completely covered in bird poo? Well that is my Juliet balcony every single day. It is a constant barrage of poo.

I was required to clean it on a daily basis otherwise it would build up too much and be an even bigger task. But cleaning it is not easy and takes about an hour every day. First I need to clean the railing and windows, but the bird poo turns into a dust and this blows inside my apartment and all over me. I will have dust all over my arms, my face and beard, in my clothes, it’ll be all over my laminate flooring, coffee table and other surfaces, and my sofa. Once cleaned, I’ll need to strip off and put my clothes straight into the washing machine. I then need to shower. After than I then clean the floor and surfaces of my living space.  And I guarantee 5 minutes after cleaning there is fresh bird poo all over my windows. It is causing such a mess and I have to do this every day (sometimes twice a day). I became anxious and self conscious of having visitors because it’s so unsightly, and I can’t have my doors open over the spring and summer months because the poo can fall inside the apartment and has stained the floors. It also attracts flies into my apartment. There are also health risks associated with breathing in dust particles from bird droppings, such as psittacosis or salmonella, so ideally I should be wearing PPE but I can’t afford to be regularly buying PPE and I shouldn’t ever be in a situation where I need to wear PPE in my own home. It had (and continues to have) a massive impact on my mental health.

I reported this again and provided photos and described the impact it was having on my mental health. I sent regular emails from September ‘22 when the birds left requesting updates. I was always informed that contractors had been spoken with, quotes received, etc. but no netting was installed and the birds returned in March 2023.

I endured another year of the daily cleaning routine and this continued to have a massive impact on my mental health. I raised a formal complaint in June 2023 but the response was basically ‘we acknowledge your complaint, we’ll aim to install netting when the birds have gone, we consider this complaint resolved.’ I responded asking them to keep the complaint open until the netting was installed, but I did not receive a reply. I emailed several times suggesting temporary solutions to the issue, such as installing a temporary shelf below the nests to catch the droppings, or for a professional cleaner to clean the mess safely. None of my emails or suggestions were responded to.

I emailed in September ‘23 when the birds left and they told me it would be sorted. I emailed several times requesting updates but never got any response. It then got close to March ‘24 and I was still not receiving any response to my emails so I threatened to go to the Property Ombudsman. They eventually replied and informed me that a contractor would be on site the following week. Indeed a contractor did arrive, but the management company had instructed them to install the netting above the wrong apartment! They know which apartment is mine, they have plans of the building, and I have sent them plenty of images of the issue, yet the netting was installed on the wrong side of the building! I emailed them to inform them, and several other emails, but none of them were responded to. And the birds returned a week or so later.

I reported my complaint to the Property Ombudsman around this time (March/April 24). Unfortunately I’ve received several updates from the Ombudsman to explain that due to the unusually large number of complaints they’re currently dealing with, they have been unable to action the next stage of the process. My case remains open with the Ombudsman for the time being but I have no idea when it’ll be looked into and the birds will be returning in little over a month.

My mental health took a huge dive last year. I couldn’t keep on top of the daily cleaning routine and the mess built up and up on my balcony and it was incredible unsightly. I couldn’t open my doors at all through the spring/summer months.

I emailed the management company again once the birds left (Sept ‘24). I didn’t receive a reply. I chased for an update at the start of the year and they eventually responded to tell me they had a quote off a contractor. I asked to be kept informed of any dates but have not been kept updated and there is still no sign of any netting being installed. The birds usually arrive at the start or mid March so this doesn’t leave a lot of time for the contractors to install.

I don’t think this is a financial issue, the cost of installing the netting will be reimbursed through our maintenance fees which always includes any building work like that. It seems to be purely a competence issue (proven by the netting being installed on the wrong side of the building last year!).

Basically I’m now seeking advice from a legal perspective. If this netting is not installed before the birds return, I’ll have to endure a 6th year with the mess. What legal challenge can I provide to the management company if this is not installed?

I am aware of the law around birds nesting and know they are protected. And I agree with this and wouldn’t want to cause harm to any nesting birds.

Any legal advice you could provide would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: Issues with excessive bird poop for 5 years which is impacting on my mental health and living standards at home. Regular contact with building management company since 2020 requesting them to install netting but this is still not installed. What legal challenge do I have against them?",1,1738604064.0,LegalAdviceUK,2,0.67,False

2 - Why did Pete Ross disappear?

3 - Alicia, you will always be the love of my life and can never be replaced.

4 - Do American men not hug their friends? I don’t think I’ve ever seen Clark and Lex hugging, even in their sweetest moments.

5 - Clark’s life would be 100x happier if he didn’t hide his secret. Everyone knows that *Smallville* is full of superhumans—Clark could just say he was one of them, and that would be it.

6 - I really enjoyed Clark and Lex’s friendship. I hate that now in every episode, the moment something bad happens, the first thing Clark does is storm into Lex’s house to ask what he did—even when he didn’t do anything. Lex has helped the Kent family so many times, yet they still assume the worst of him and are afraid to reveal anything.

7 - I’ll say it again—everyone knew Alicia had powers, and she was out there casually having coffee with Clark in public. The Kents could just say that Clark was another meteor-infected human, and most of Clark’s problems wouldn’t exist.

8 - When is Zod coming back?

9 - I was shocked when Lois appeared. She’s so fun, and her lines are always so well-written. Actually, the dialogues in this show are all really interesting.

10 - If I had a cent for every time someone gets thrown against a wall and conveniently passes out just to avoid discovering Clark’s secret, I’d be richer than Lex.

11 - Lana used to be my favorite character at the start. Now, I don’t know if I still like her… My mom says she’s evil and just pretends to be an innocent damsel to deceive and manipulate men.

12 - Everyone in this show is *way* too attractive, and sometimes the music and outfits make me feel nostalgic for the 2000s, when I grew up.",3,1738604061.0,Smallville,1,0.8,False

Maybe some of these will be helpful to you, maybe you know them all already. Some are definitely really small things that I didn't realize until super late. If you know something that you think people should know, please add and discuss it here!

\-quickhacks are arrangeable, descending from last picked to first

\-every piece of clothing you pick up is immediately added to your wardrobe, so you can sell or scrap them all. **however**, if an item has armor, the wardrobe version will not keep this. you can instead keep the items that have stat buffs in your stash, and wear combinations of these items underneath your created outfit

\-some clothing pieces in night city are unique but not flagged as iconic. you can tell by picking them up, a preview image will pop up on screen just like when you loot an iconic item

\-always craft every weapon mod you can. tier one is needed to make tier 2, and so on. these items aren't good for anything else, so if you can craft the weapon mod, do it

\-chimera core can be displayed in MBH10 regardless of what you choose to make with it

\-easiest way to incapacitate cyberpsychos is to make a revolver with the PAX mod, and get the final shot with this weapon. make sure not to apply any damage effects when their health is low

\-if you override turrets instead of hack them they stay friendly

\-you can perform an aerial takedown if you are unnoticed and jump on top of an enemy, also works just from a double jump. stomp them choombas!

\-you can quickhack enemies while they are driving

\-cyberware capacity shards have a fixed drop count so don't miss any

\-to get bounties rewarded you need to deliver a final killing blow after an enemy is laid out on the ground ""dead""

\-gorilla arms can up your body stat check by 3

\-some vendors sell braindances other than story mission ones, these are completely useless

\-glen and corpo apartments have coffee machines which give a stamina regeneration buff

\-food and drink buff times stack so eat and drink everything you see

\-there is an iguana pet, the egg can be found during ""the heist"" though it is very small

\-NCPD scanner missions do not respawn, and are the best way to level in early game. there are 4 or 5 of these with iconic weapon crafting specs

\-you can zoom while looking with L2 unarmed, as well as in the scanner with up and down d-pad (didn't know until 2nd playthru)

\-if a door can be opened it will be highlighted blue in the scanner

\-if something is required to open a door, there will be a light blue line leading from the door to it in the scanner

\-some of the radio stations in night city have talk shows that can give you valuable insight into things (morro rock is my favorite)

\-the PL diving suit you keep is functional, also doing beat on the brat with the relic skills is much easier

\-in 2.0 all ripperdocs have the same inventory, and after you visit the PL ripper the rest will sell his iconics as well

\-black market vendor in PL sells iconics that you miss picking up in the main game

\-check **every** vendor in PL, most sell iconic consumables that give permanent stat increases and some also have skill and xp shards

\-in 2.0 you can now become a cyberpsycho if you max out your cyberware

\-you will not be able to have all skill trees at a high level. the best way to play is to choose one stat you will keep very low, and save your skill points until you know what you want because often the best skills require multiple points, or other skills

\-you can respec attribute points only once, but skill points can be refunded at any time (small ones NOT big ones)

\-changing vehicles when cops lose sight of you will cause them to not notice you. you can also go to any fixer or main mission location to lose your level instantly

\-datashards have set spawn locations, but what's on them is often random and repeatable. If a datashard is yellow, it is unique and pertains to the situation, location or mission. This isn't always true but most of them are random and repeatable

\-if you are ever tasked with stealing data from a computer, try to access the data first. otherwise it will be formatted when stolen and you may miss quest altering info

\-autofixer discounts can be stacked until a car is free, but once used you must start stacking again

\-to get the autojock achievement, you don't need every single car but at least one of every model type (quartz, type 66 etc)

\-number in corner of weapon pic is ammo count of that type

\-you can turn vehicle lamps on and off with a brief hold of the left d pad

\-if you just press call vehicle it will call your last used car

\-in the ff06b5 easter egg, you just have to complete the maze to unlock the mainframes. you don't have to beat adam smasher or make it out before the timer hits 0, as long as you've passed the maze section they should turn on

EPS light, cam sensors being funky","Hey there y'all, I've been doing some work on my girlfriend's car recently, as it's been throwing a combination of issues that I haven't been able to get to the bottom of. Looking for any help or advice, and willing to buy ya a coffee for your time!

A couple weeks ago, it threw a ""Stop engine, low/no oil pressure"" notice and went in limp mode. So I tested the fuel pressure and it was up to par, ended up replacing the oil pressure sensor while it was out. 

It also threw a CAM sensor (bank 1) code so I replaced that as well.

Additionally, the EPS light would show up and engine would stutter a bit, notably on sharp turns and coming to a stop. I removed the throttle body and tested for resistance, got no change when opening the butterfly, so I put a new throttle body in, and changed out the spark plugs and ignition coils while I had everything out.

So, so far it has:
-New ignition coils
-New spark plugs
-New throttle body
-New cam sensor & oil pressure sensor

After buttoning it back up, it drove fine for about 10 miles. Now, all of a sudden it randomly runs rough, almost feels like the timing is off for a second and then goes back to normal, RPMs seem a bit funky, and it feels like it's making the transmission shift hard. Now it's throwing codes again for both cam sensors.

It seems to me there might be some kind of electrical fault or potentially a timing issue, maybe I should check the exhaust timing?

Nothing but a rich collection of dirt, weeds and tall grasses that stretch all the way to the trees.

But every now and then, when the moon is just right, and when the air is so cold it hurts to breathe—the **house** appears at night.

It’s always the same: a dark, 19th-century Victorian mansion, complete with spires and enormous windows, the kind of place you would never see out here in the boonies.

I had trouble believing it was real the first time .

One of my college-mates played a prank and gave me a cookie which was a potent edible. I was up all night at home, waiting for the unexpected high to pass. That’s when I first noticed the **house,** fully built, standing some odd thirty yards away.

It was quite an experience, seeing a magical haunted mansion while thoroughly tripping. I thought it was just the THC playing tricks on me, but by the time I sobered up around 4:00 AM…  the **house** was still there. 

It was too real to be a hallucination, and too vivid to be a trick of the light. 

I took pictures on my phone from the living room, bathroom and even the balcony. The **house** was a real structure. A real, creepy, pitch black-looking abode that gave an indisputable bad vibe. And then as soon as dawn broke, it faded away.

Over breakfast, I explained to my grandma what I had seen, and even showed her photos. But she waved away all my “nonsense”.

“Ain’t been anythin’ there for sixty years,” she would say. “Don’t conjure what isn’t.”

I brought it up a few more times, but grandma would always shut it down. “We’re the only ones that live on this road, Robert. Don’t be ridiculous. Are you on drugs?”

\*\*\*

Maybe I was just ‘on drugs’. The **house** didn’t reappear any night after that, so I went back to focusing on school. The whole reason I moved out to live with Grandma was because her place was only an hour-long bus ride to college.

But then came another evening when I stayed up late finishing an essay. When I went to grab some juice from the fridge, I saw it peering from the large kitchen window. 

The **house**. It was back.

This time it appeared much more *alive* than before. A glowing fuchsia color shined out from its innards, and there appeared to be movement behind its windows.

I knew I wasn’t tripping again because I was writing my schoolwork. I was sober AF. Closing my laptop, I excitedly unboxed some binoculars.

That’s how I saw the *shadows inside.* 

It was way too dark to make out anything past silhouettes, but I definitely saw the tops of heads and shoulders pass by the windows and settle in various spots in the **house.** They moved with a casual, low-key energy, as if everyone was worn out but still awake. Restless.

*Who were these people? And how were they inside this* *place*?

Then my attention turned to the trees ruffling behind the **house**—where a tall figure emerged from the woods. 

An immediate knot tied itself in my stomach. I had never seen anything like this person. He wore a velvet-looking frock, above an embroidered vest, and waist high trousers, which were all somehow tailor-made to fit his *eight-foot long arms and legs.*

He moved like some anthropoid stick bug, shuffling and ambling, often using one of his long arms as another leg.  Eventually this bizarre 19th century aristocrat spider hunched over the door, took a glance at me and raised his arm.

I wanted to turn away, but I couldn’t. I was frozen. The figure’s hollow eyes, even from that distance, felt like they were staring directly at me.

His skeletal fingers made the “come hither” motion. He recognized my fascination.

He knew I was being drawn to the **house.** 

He knew I was watching.

He knew  … I wanted a deeper peek.

\*\*\*

The next morning, my grandma handed me a letter in a brown envelope with no return address. She said it must have come from my parents.

I opened the letter and knew right away that it didn’t.

There was only a single piece of parchment inside, withered and worn. In thick black ink, only two words were written in very old cursive: *You’re Invited.*

“Where did you get this letter?”

“Where do you think?” My grandma poured herself coffee. The mailbox.”

“Who dropped it off?”

“Who do you think?” My grandma burnt her lips on the coffee. “The mailman.”

“The mailman? You saw him?”

“Jesus Christ, Robert. Yes, the mailman. He comes every morning ‘round eight when there’s mail. How do you think mail works? Are you on drugs?”

Full disclosure: back with my parents, I did go through a phase where I was smoking a lot of pot. They told my grandma there would be zero tolerance if I was ever caught blazing. They threatened with military school, community service, etc. 

(So I’ve been careful only to blaze on the school grounds. Never near grandma’s.)

“No grandma, I was just wondering about the letter is all.”

“Nothing else to wonder about. Now eat your breakfast.”

\*\*\*

That night, after grams went to bed, I played some Civ 6 to pass the time, eagerly awaiting midnight.

Every ten minutes I’d check to see if that empty lot sprouted anything. But It stayed empty. By about 12:30 AM, the **house** still hadn’t arrived and I was disappointed.

In a last ditch effort, I put on several layers and brought one of my secret blunts with me. The first night I had seen the mansion when I was accidentally high, so I figured it couldn’t hurt to smoke a little now and see what would happen. 

After quietly closing the front door, I walked several feet away to make sure the light in grandma’s room was still off.

It was. She was sleeping.

With utmost secrecy, I brought the blunt and lighter to my lips—when a chill wind snuffed out the flame. My fingers went cold, my stomach formed a knot.

The **house** had returned.

And this time it was standing closer than ever before, barely three car lengths separated my grandma’s place from its front doors.

It’s like it was presenting itself.

I walked toward it, driven by an impulse I couldn’t explain. The air was thick, almost electric. I just *had* to take a peek.

The normally untamed weeds and bushes were now suddenly pruned and lining a cobblestone path toward the **house**. I walked along the polished granite pieces until I reached the first wooden step. My heart slowed.

The shadows inside seemed to shift, like something was moving toward the door. I inched backward ever so slightly, keeping my eyes on the knob.

A figure—tall and thin, like the one I’d seen before—stepped behind the frosted glass. Within moments, the front door swung open and his strange limbs came clambering beneath the wooden frame. The second I made eye contact, I met the strangest, most disarming smile I've ever seen in my entire life

For a moment, it felt like I had known this man for a long time, like this guy was the uncle I used to visit each year… only I knew that couldn’t be true. 

The smile had some kind of aura. Something that emanated a fake nostalgia. I couldn’t really put it in words when it was happening but I am telling you now in retrospect—this guy had a powerful charm in between his gleaming teeth.

“My boy! My lad! It would appear as though you have accepted my invitation! Yes indeed!” The 19th century aristocrat spidered over to me at a somewhat alarming speed.

“Please, allow me to introduce myself, I am Reginald Beddingfield Hollows, Esquire —the proprietor of this fine estate.” His left hand effortlessly brushed the ceiling of the awning high above us. ""And you my lad, simply *must* come inside, we have been dying to meet you! The demand is insatiable, my good boy.”

Inching away, I responded in a hushed tone. “Uh… *Who’s* been dying to meet me?”

“Your friends! Inside the **house**!” He tried to follow my gaze. “They all know you dear lad, they’ve been watching you for a long time! Come in! Come in!”

I could hear faint voices coming from deeper inside, it did kind of sound like a low-key **house** party. Somebody was delicately playing the piano.

“Umm… can I think about it?”

“Think about it?” Reginald laughed a perfectly pitched, high society laugh. “What’s there to think about my boy? You’ve already accepted by arriving at my doorstep. You *want* to come in!”

My stomach was tensing up into some kind of triple knot, I was finding it hard to walk backwards.

“In fact, it would be quite rude *not* to come in. Quite rude indeed. ” Reginald’s smile slowly dissipated. “Especially after all the effort we put in. Today was going to be *your* night, Robert, They’re all going to be *so* disappointed.”

*How did he know my name?*

Like some kind of flexible insect, he scooped his head down low to meet my line of sight. His teeth beamed at me with a glossy shimmer. “You *want* to come in, Robert, we both know that. It’ll be fun.”

Although I could feel my stomach contort itself further, an immense feeling of trust also breezed through my chest. It’s like this was the five hundredth time I’ve met Reginald.

“It’ll be fun?”

“Riotous, Robert! A fête in your honour! A feast! A dance! The string quartet has been practicing for ages!”

Again, that feeling of trust. I went from being merely tipsy, to fully drunk on Reginald’s nostalgia magic. His arm lightly rested on my back, guiding me through the front doors.

I entered the **house.** 

The air was cold. Freezing, in fact. I could see my breath in the dim light. The flickering purple glow came from several gas-lit sconces on the ceiling. The walls seemed to stretch and warp, like the **house** wasn’t quite real. Like it was bending around me, enclosing me.

I wasn’t alone either. Figures moved in the shadows, their forms indistinct, their heads tilted in my direction. They looked human, but just barely. They watching me without blinking, staring with wide eyes.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to run. But I couldn’t. All the walls and doors bended away from my touch. It felt like the **house** had a grip on my very soul, like it was pulling me deeper into its endless corridors.

One of the figures stepped forward—a girl, also about my age, her face was pale and stretched like a mask. She wore clothes that may have been in fashion about twenty years ago.

“You don’t belong out there anymore,” she said softly, his voice almost tender. “You belong here now. You’re one of us now.”

It was a mistake to step inside. Once you’ve seen what’s behind those purple-lit windows, there’s no escaping.

The **house** never lets you go.

\*\*\*

I’ve had loads of time trapped in this **house** where nothing changes. 

I don’t get hungry. 

I don’t get sleepy. 

The police can’t see the **house**, and they’ve blocked me for calling them too many times with my “wild stories”.

My phone has been permanently stuck at 23 percent battery for god knows how long. Time doesn't seem to exist here. Only warping corridors and college kids who all say the same thing.

“I came out here to live with grandma. It was only an hour long bus-ride to school.”

Across one of the ever-shifting hallways I once discovered a painting of my “grandma” wearing the same kind of aristocratic clothing as Reginald. She stared out with the same passive face. Those same disinterested eyes.

I’ve typed this story out on my phone, searching for help. I wish I could tell you where to look, but I have no idea where I am, the windows stretch away from me.

If you ever see a mansion that only appears at night, and you come across a tall, spidery man that looks like Reginald, tell him that you are inviting me, *Robert,* to come outside.

I believe there might be some kind of magic in the use of invitation. Some kind of sanctuary. At least I hope so. It’s my only chance of escape.

If someone who reads this *does* find a way to free me from this limbo, I promise you my everlasting thanks.

Throwaway account because, well, reddit. For some context, I am 31(F), I have a good job, I live a comfortable life, I am well liked in my limited social circles and while I am not someone with a lethal face card, it is enough to get by. But I have been extremely unlucky in love to the point that I genuinely think I am cursed.

I am not perfect, neither I am looking for anyone perfect. I am aware of my shortfalls and I constantly take stock of the changes I can make to be better as a person. A bunch of stuff, while not the worst things that can happen to someone, happened to me while growing up and it has done a number on my brain. I have depression, anxiety and ADHD, although I am highly functional and the only time people find out is when I make jokes about these things to cope with them. 

Anyway, long story short, I do not know how to be vulnerable and subsequently intimate with someone while simultaneously every fibre of my being begging for it. While I have zero trouble making friends with literally anyone, I’ve noticed it is really really hard for me to click with someone romantically and I am not even looking for a man in finance who is 6ft and has blue eyes. Just a regular-ol-chum who can make my heart skip. I have rejected people and people have rejected me. While I have had my heart broken a few times, I don’t bear any ill will towards anyone (well may be one). People like each other or they don’t. Someone not liking you is not a testament to who you are as a person. But I am so tired of the cycles. I hate myself for being so difficult. I’ve never taken advantage of anyone and have met some nice guys, but it just doesn’t seem to click, either for them, either for me and I am getting so tired. I have so much love to give and so much love that I want. I want to cook for someone, put their head on my chest and my run my fingers through their hair. I want someone to hug me so tight all my broke pieces come together. Hard enough that if I can let go of this protective barrier that has been weighing me down since forever. I want us to cuddle through the weekends. I want them to remember what coffee I like and wake me up with it. I want intimacy that heals both me and my partner. But why is it so difficult to find and why is saying this out loud making me feel so weak. 

P.S: This is a rhetorical rant. I understand the objective reasons for why most things happen the way they happen but I still can’t help feel what I feel and the way I feel is miserable. Also, I can’t do casual, like at all, so you know…….god really “Oopsied” here. ",4,1738603541.0,OffMyChestIndia,12,1.0,False

1iguag1,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1iguag1/completed_first_week_of_adf/,Completed first week of ADF,"F 33 6’2” SW: 192 CW:188 GW 170-165

TL;DR:
Fasted M-W-F, ate near TDEE on other days. Hunger was manageable but strongest in the evenings. Sleep was a bit rough on fasting days. Had some GI distress, likely from electrolytes not being dialed in. Lost 4lbs, would like to continue to see a weightloss of 2 pounds weekly. Will continue ADF for the foreseeable future, with the possibility of including some longer fasts on occasion.

So I just wrapped up my first full week of ADF and overall it was a really positive experience. My main goal is weight loss, but I also really wanted to introduce some much needed structure and mindfulness to my routine. After a holiday season of eating all the things and spending way too much on takeout, I figured it was time to buckle down and get back on track.

How I Structured the Week:
Fasting Days (M-W-F): I drank coffee with a splash of milk, the occasional Diet Coke, tea at night, and tons of water with electrolytes.

Eating Days (T-Th-Sat): Ate near my Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), sticking to whole foods and avoiding takeout.

Sunday: OMAD to transition back into the fasting cycle smoothly.

Exercise: Strenuous Pilates reformer workouts on Tuesday & Thursday.

What Went Well:
Hunger was manageable – It came in waves, mostly around my usual mealtimes, but it wasn’t unbearable. Evenings were the hardest, but I expected that.

No takeout or junk food – Kept it all whole foods, which made me feel better overall.

Pilates workouts felt good – No significant drop in performance, which was a relief.

Energy was solid when hydrated/electrolytes were on point – When I stayed consistent with water & electrolytes, I felt fine.

Challenges & What Needs Adjusting:
GI distress was real – Easily the worst part of the week. I think my electrolytes weren’t dialed in properly, so I’ll be tweaking that moving forward.

Sleep struggled on fasting days – It wasn’t terrible, but I definitely found it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep when fasting.

Energy levels fluctuated – Sometimes I felt totally fine, others I felt sluggish, which I think ties back to hydration & electrolytes.

Background & Why I’m Doing This:
I’ve done keto/low-carb in the past, along with intermittent fasting (OMAD, 16:8), and had success with weight loss before. But after gaining some weight over the holidays and generally feeling out of control with my habits (food, spending, and exercise), I knew I needed something more structured. ADF seemed like a great fit.

Plan Moving Forward:
Stick with ADF for the foreseeable future and fine-tune my approach.

Focus on dialing in electrolytes to help with GI issues & energy levels.

Maybe attempt a 48-hour fast in February and see how that feels.

If things go well, I might experiment with longer fasts down the line.

Overall, it was a solid first week. Definitely some things to tweak, but I feel good about continuing. If anyone has tips for managing electrolytes or sleep on fasting days, I’d love to hear them.",2,1738603087.0,intermittentfasting,1,1.0,False
1iguac0,https://i.redd.it/7flydpukjyge1.jpeg,Compost pile stays cold.,"Living in the UK, about a 2 years ago we started to compost into a small 80L black waste bin in our back garden that I'd drilled some holes into on the side and the bottom. It mainly took the waste food from the house and cardboard from deliveries that I'd rip up into pieces and chuck inside. This turned into 2 bins, then 3 and then 4 all the while having 1 empty bin to turn the oldest into and so on. However we've never seen much in the way of heat coming from any of the bins, they do kind of break stuff down but just takes abit longer than youtube videos suggest.

Having read online that it was likely the size of the compost pile that was holding us back, this past autumn I got my hands on some spare pallets from work and made a compost bin near where we are likely to attempt to grow some fruit/veg and dumped the 4 bins into it, only for them collectively to barely take up any real space in the new bin.

I gathered alot of boxes and paper from work and shredded them, picked up leaves from the neighbourhood and put in alot of the garden waste while clearing up the boarders etc. I also popped into a local star bucks and came away with alot of used coffee grounds afew times over the weeks and dumped all into the compost pile and gave it a good mix. It's usually kept covered with afew sheets of cardboard and a plastic sheeting to keep the rain off and generally feels damp to the touch, but still haven't seen anything go over 10-15⁰c over the winter, even with turning it once a week, far from the 50-60⁰c (130-140⁰F) others showcase.

I believe there's a fairly good mix of browns to greens overall, so is it just down to the ambient temperature as it just doesn't seem to want to kick start.

Is there anything that can be done, aside from pissing on it, or is it simply a case of waiting afew months until things warm up and things come back to life in the spring and check on it then?",1,1738603081.0,composting,0,1.0,False

At the beginning of this year, my Tangerine World Mastercard was working then all of a sudden, it was randomly being declined at various places. The random became every transaction, so I called Tangerine and they said they had ""bypassed"" all restrictions on my card (weird, because I didn't know I had restrictions at all). Before the call ended, the customer service assistant (CSA) said to try it again after 24 hours. I did and it still declined. Since I couldn't pay with my Mastercard, I had to pull out my debit card and *it didn't work either*. Confused, I called Tangerine again and they said they don't see any restrictions on my card at all but that they had ""checked"" my account and all transactions should go through now. Fast forward to last week, I tried to purchase tickets to a show happening at school and my Mastercard worked. I thought, ""Finally!"". Tried purchasing coffee a few hours later and it was declined.

I have another credit card that I only use for emergencies that I've now been using because my Mastercard isn't working at all. I have tried to transfer funds from my Tangerine chequing account to another banking institution and it went through (I assumed, because it went onto my pending transactions list and the other bank is linked to my account already). A few days later, the amount I transferred was credited back to my chequing account. I called Tangerine and they said I transferred money from the other institution to my Tangerine account. I told them that it was credited back and that it was supposed to go to the other institution (I needed to pay my credit card there). Basically, they asked me to try to do the transaction again while they were on the phone and they said that it should transfer within two business days.

This infuriates me because I've never had this issue before and now I'm constantly worried that I will not be able to pay anything at all. To confirm, I do have funds in all my accounts (not a lot, since I'm a graduate student, but I have funds in all my accounts). Has anyone else experienced this? If so, how did you resolve it? I really don't want to transfer banks, but I have tuition fees to pay and I don't want to incur charges for issues that I don't have control over.

1igu860,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1igu860/how_to_win_in_trading_keep_going_after_everyone/,How to win in trading: keep going after everyone else stops,"Hi everyone,

I'm a husband, a dad of five, and a full-time trader.

Making the leap to full-time trading has been quite a journey, and along the way, I’ve picked up some concepts that have helped me navigate the ups and downs.

As I’ve been writing out these ideas for myself, I thought they might hopefully be encouraging to others—whether you're considering the transition to full-time trading or just looking to refine your approach.

**Here's my post:**

Last week, I had coffee with an aspiring trader. The last time we talked, he was bursting with fresh ideas and eager to make his mark in the trading world.

But when I asked how things were going, and if he was still working toward making trading his full-time career, he hesitated.

""Trading was way harder than I expected,"" he said. ""I lost money and decided to stop. I tried stocks and options—options were cool, but I just couldn’t grasp it.

I realized it would take years to get good at this and I’m not ready to invest that kind of time right now. Maybe I’ll try again someday.""

Unfortunately, this reaction is all too common. But why is it the norm for so many?

Yes, the barrier to entry in trading is high—but here’s the thing: so is everything else.

For example: the average acceptance rate for Ivy League schools is under 4%. Only the top 8-10% of realtors make six figures. Just 5% of all Amazon sellers generate over $1 million in revenue. The reality is that the barrier to success in *any* field is high.

I don’t think trading is anything extraordinary. It’s not some mysterious ""boogeyman"" of business that's harder than other career paths. I believe it’s totally achievable for the person who truly wants it and is willing to put in the work—just like earning an Ivy League education, excelling in real estate, or hitting $1 million in Amazon sales. It all comes down to the individual and their commitment.

That’s why it’s frustrating to see new traders give in to self-doubt. So much potential gets derailed by short-term discouragement.

Today, I want to offer some encouragement. A career in trading isn’t just worth pursuing—it’s absolutely possible when built on the right foundation.

Let’s flip the script on this undeserved doubt and push your trading journey forward.

# The big problem with short term thinking

When I talk to struggling traders, or those hoping to transition to full-time, there’s a common theme: they view trading as a fast and easy path to riches. But in reality, it’s just like any other vocation or business.

Think about it—when else is taking the long road ever seen as a problem? Plumbers, dentists, real estate agents, and restaurant owners don’t have an issue with putting in the time and effort to get where they want to go.

What if we as traders adopted the same mindset?  
Trading is a business, after all.

What if, instead of thinking like most new traders who focus on days and weeks, we shifted to thinking in terms of months and years?

Whenever I face a decision, I like to ask myself: ""If I choose this path, what’s the alternative?"" In trading, the alternative to long-term thinking is, of course, short-term thinking—and that’s where the real problems start. This mindset can lead to things like:

* **Rushing to make a profit right away.** What if a restaurant tried this? They might cut corners by using cheap ingredients, skimp on marketing, skip employee training, and ignore the fundamentals—leading to few, if any, return customers.
* **Making quick decisions with large amounts of money, without the experience to back it up.** What if a new plumber took out a huge loan for tons of equipment and work trucks, without any real customers or business experience? Wouldn’t it make more sense to use what he has, build a customer base, and then figure out what tools he actually needs?
* **Jumping from one strategy to the next, without giving them enough time.** What if a real estate agent, looking for leads, tried knocking on doors in a local neighborhood for a few days, then gave up to focus on SEO for their website, just because they didn’t get immediate results? Had they stuck with the door-knocking strategy a little longer, they might have seen a lead come through and realized it was working.
* **Starting each business day without a clear process or routine.** Imagine a local dentist who had no set schedule, no patient records, and no clear steps for addressing patient needs. It would be chaos.

Notice a theme yet? *(Good things take time!)*  
Viewing trading as a long-term endeavor is what truly makes the difference.

# But what if you’re still stuck?

I know what you might be thinking: ""That sounds great, but I'm still scared. I’m afraid of starting and failing. I’m not in the right financial position to start a business, let alone trading.""

And that’s okay. You’re not alone. Every single trader, no matter their experience, feels that type of fear. Every day.

My heart still skips a beat when I see the clock ticking down to the opening bell, even after years of trading. Millions of people—wannabe traders and elite fund managers alike—feel the same way. That fear doesn’t disappear overnight. It may never go away completely, no matter what business you’re in.

But here’s my encouragement to you:

What you want is just on the other side of the unknown.

Every day you take a small step into the unknown, every time you take another trading rep, or make a small process improvement, they all add to your confidence to keep going. Because remember, you’re thinking long-term, just like a real business.

This is how you win.

# It's time to win

I know—words are nice—but how do you actually move forward? What are some practical steps you can use to move forward in your trading journey?

Let me put it this way: If you wanted to start a plumbing business, how would you ensure success, stay profitable, and keep going even when others have stopped?

1. **Start with the basics.** Use new information to help lower fear of the unknown. First, you’d figure out exactly what you need to start—certifications, tools, insurance, and so on. You’d probably watch a few YouTube videos from different people to get an overview of what it's like. (I really appreciate SMB Capital’s free trading content - no need to pay for anything, just learn all you can.)
2. **Get hands-on practice.** Next, as an aspiring plumber, you’d start practicing with small jobs around the house or for close family, just to get those reps in and learn what it really takes. (This could look like taking small reps, I’m a big believer in one-share trades. Buy and sell one share only, until you have the data needed to show you where you’re profitable and you can start to scale.)
3. **Track everything.** As you go, you might write everything down. Maybe film or take pictures of each plumbing job so you can study them later. You’d track what you enjoy, what areas are low-stress and easy for you, and what mistakes you make—along with specific ways to fix them. (I like using Notion as a free way to start tracking things. Also Edgewonk is a great low-cost option.)
4. **Build a routine.** You then start forming a daily routine. You’d maybe go to class to learn the trade in the morning, do homework in the afternoon, and then maybe work on a small jobs for practice at night or on weekends. You’d then make adjustments each day, noting things like: *""I did poorly on my last exam because I stayed up too late. I’ll go to bed at 9 pm to focus better in class, as well as have more energy for my plumbing jobs.""*(In trading, this is what’s known as your “process”. Your routine that you follow, which you know gives you the best chance for success each day.)
5. **Repeat and improve.** The key in any business is repetition. You’d keep following the same steps every day until you get so good that you either have the pick of which plumbing company to work for, or, start your own business. Then assume it would take one to three years to get there. (This is when you find your “edge” — a repeatable trade setup that you know gives you positive expected value over time.)
6. **Bonus.** Along the way, you might only buy what you really need and try to practice frugality—no loans, using your own truck and tools, adding only as needed. This keeps the risk low while you learn and build your business. (This means keeping your costs and overhead low, in order to preserve and save up capital to trade with. And no need to overspend on fancy software or tools in the beginning— the focus should be on the fundamentals.)

# The bottom line

Let the aspiring trader at the beginning of this post serve as a reminder.

When it comes to building a trading career, you’re faced with two paths:

One path is focused on the short term, driven by immediate results and quick wins. This often leads to frustration and burnout, causing many to quit before they’ve given themselves a real chance to succeed.

The other path—which offers a much higher probability of success—is grounded in long-term thinking. It’s about committing to continuous learning, persevering through challenges, and allowing time to develop your skills and strategy.

Success in trading—or in any field—isn’t owned by the smartest, the luckiest, or even the most naturally talented. It belongs to those who *stay in the game*.

The truth is, every master trader, every successful entrepreneur, and every top performer started where you are: uncertain, inexperienced, and full of doubt. The only difference? They decided to push through and embrace the long game, and to build their foundation one step at a time.

So, what will you choose? Will you let short-term struggles define you? Or will you shift your mindset, commit to the process and lifestyle, and give yourself the time needed to truly succeed?

The choice is yours. The opportunity is there. You got this!",4,1738602934.0,Trading,3,0.83,False

Ive been in a relationship for 2 years and some change. Started off as something not serious, turned into something where i feel unappreciated. I am constantly being told that i am overreacting, im entitled thats why i dont have friends, i focus on the wrong things instead of putting the energy towards something useful.

I moved to another country 3-4 years ago and because of financial instability and lack of socializing (mostly due to the lockdown) i was depressed for quite a while and gained ~40kg. All i did here was study and work. After the relationship i lost my sister which was a huge loss for me.

During the relationship he would say stuff that would make me compare myself to other girls. Example: we are walking in a park during the summer and he tells me to try to be like girls around so he can be proud of me and be attracted to me more. Example 2: him watching porn right next to me and i wake up to see that.

I have repeatedly told him to not watch other women because that makes me feel like trash. He tries to hide it when he checks out ig or other ""stars"" but i can tell. I have also caught him on tinder ""checking out his options"" not even 2 days after we had a fight. I used to have higher sexual drive in the beginning if the relationship and after a while it just went lower and lower. I work mostly 9-10 hour shifts a day, 6 days a week. He doesnt work and games quite a lot, up to 27 hours at a time.

He games when he is stressed with uni to avoid reality and when he is done with gaming he sees the mess in the house and remembers the uni responsibilities and starts to freak out and demand i clean the house or do the dishes. I used to clean the house every day, wash the dishes frequently and then i realized doesnt matter how hard i try to keep the space clean, it gets dirty after a few hours, because he doesnt clean up after himself, leaves cups and plates and clothes everywhere and im just too busy cleaning up that i dont get to do anything else.

I have asked him to take me on a date or bring me flowers at least once a month (which can be as low as $20 in our area in total) and he says we have so much more important stuff to focus on. I have planned a few trips over the last 4-5 months and he believes that because he is there with me and we eat in those trips, it is considered a date.

The other day he came up to me to have some intimate time but i was in shift so i couldnt pay attention to him. He complained that we do not have enough sex (only a few times a month) and i should push myself a little. I didnt like what he said so i just went back to working and after a while i went to him to ask him to treat me better, otherwise this would not work out. He said YOU treat me better. I broke up with him and later found out that 3 days before i went to a trip by myself while we were on good terms he texted his ex gf to invite her to a dinner or a coffee to talk. He used to say that this girl was a slut, fucked one of his friends, etc. I also found his tinder which he says is inactive and he only wanted to check if he can still register using his real name after some kind of a problem with tinder. The picture on tinder was taken in the bathroom of the apartment that we have lived in for 1-1.5 years.

A day or 2 passes and he tells me he wants to talk, we start talking (more like arguing). I say everything he does wrong and he just laughs or tells me that i havent been able to lose weight in 2 years, all i do is work, i dont have sex with him, i dont clean the house, i get irritated a lot, ""what do you bring to the table"". He says im miserable, i do not have friends here because im entitled, thats why one of my friends didnt wanna talk to me anymore (completely different topic). Fast forward to a few hours later, he is calmed down and wants to talk again, i start saying the same thing, how he is the one to text his ex and i say this over and over so maybe he will understand whats the actual fuck up here. While im explaining things, he just says fuck it fuck it fuck it and then calls me imbecile. I ask him to repeat and he repeats it. I was raged so i get up but still try to keep myself from doing anything. He gets up faster than i do, pushes me and just starts kicking me, pulling my hair, etc. He said ""i could kill you if i wanted to"". He left a bump on my head, my hair falling out, my legs, arms, neck and back sore/hurting. His reasoning for pushing me first was because i intimidated him a few times by throwing stuff around and once following him with a whiskey bottle after he fucked someone else while we were on a break and he was still talking to me about getting back together.

This was just a part of the fight, but after a while he says do you wanna talk, are you planning to just not talk to me from now on, etc. The next day he says ""everything escalated for no reason yesterday, it was a mistake"". Now im torn between ""i can give him a chance to treat me well until i move 2 weeks later"" and ""i do not deserve this, i want to feel like a woman"".

I have repeatedly told him that he needs to treat me better so i can do the same, but he insists that i need to put in the effort to lose weight so he will treat me better. He says i act like a man and i know that. I hate acting like a man, i hate not wanting to impress my partner, not wanting to be intimate, not feeling and acting like a woman, but i cant do it when i dont get supported in any way, financially, emotionally, mentally.

I am not paying for the both of us, but just needing to provide for myself is stressful enough. I do not know how i feel, how i should move on. I know i need to break up, i have known this for a long while, but i do not want to throw everything away either. I am losing this ""not wanting to throw everything away"" feeling over time, but i dont want to lose the respect for myself until i completely get rid of it.

This coffee maker has me torn between loving its innovative features and occasionally scratching my head at some hiccups. Let me walk you through how it performed in my kitchen.

The design of the Hamilton Beach 47950 BrewStation is a mix of sleek black and silver finishes, giving it a modern touch that fits seamlessly with my other stainless steel appliances. Its build feels solid enough, though not exactly premium. The removable water reservoir is a genius touch; I loved being able to detach and fill it without awkwardly pouring water all over my countertop. However, one thing became clear pretty quickly—the plastic components, like the dispensing lever, felt a little flimsy. It’s not a deal-breaker, but I’ll admit I was wary about how it might hold up over time.

Want to see Hamilton Beach 47950’s latest price on Amazon? [Click here to find out.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/hamilton-beach-47950-review-b00af7wuo2-evaluation/)

What really intrigued me was the brewing performance. This machine brews coffee at a decent speed, filling the 12-cup reservoir in about 8-10 minutes. The enclosed brewing system claims to keep coffee fresh for up to four hours, and while that sounds amazing on paper, I noticed that the coffee’s temperature and flavor slightly dropped past the two-hour mark. Still, the coffee stays warm and doesn’t scorch, thanks to the internal heater.

The coffee flavor itself? Smooth, rich, and satisfying for the most part. I tried both the regular and bold settings, and the bold option does pack a more robust punch. There’s also an iced coffee feature, which had my teenage daughter raving about her cold brew experiments. The machine brews directly over ice, which is a fun and convenient touch, though you’ll need to play around with ice-to-water ratios to avoid a watered-down taste.

Now, on to the cleaning and maintenance. The removable reservoir and coffee tank make cleaning fairly straightforward, which is a relief because I dread scrubbing coffee stains. The machine even has a helpful digital reminder that lets you know when it’s time for a deep clean. That said, water pooling in the filter basket post-brew was annoying. I had to be cautious when moving it around to avoid leaving a trail of drips on the counter.

**Pros**

* Sleek design with a removable water reservoir for easy filling.
* Keeps coffee warm for hours without the risk of burning it.
* Bold and iced coffee brewing options add versatility.
* Digital cleaning reminders are a nice touch.
* No glass carafe to worry about breaking or cleaning.

**Cons**

* Plastic components, like the dispensing lever, feel fragile.
* Coffee flavor diminishes slightly after sitting for extended periods.
* Water pooling in the filter basket can cause spills.
* Takes some trial and error to perfect the iced coffee feature.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to a traditional drip coffee maker like the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup, the Hamilton Beach 47950 wins in terms of innovation. The no-carafe design eliminates spills and the risk of breaking a glass pot, which is a big plus. However, machines like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 might edge it out in terms of durability, with their sturdier build and stainless steel components. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach BrewStation has a unique iced coffee feature, something you won’t find in many models at this price point.

Where it falls short is the occasional design flaw. The plastic parts and water pooling issues can be frustrating, while competitors like Ninja Coffee Bar are known for their robust construction and more sophisticated brewing options. That said, the Hamilton Beach 47950 still holds its ground as a great mid-range coffee maker with unique features.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

This coffee maker sits comfortably in the mid-range price category. For its price, the Hamilton Beach 47950 offers more features than basic drip machines, such as the innovative dispensing system, bold and iced coffee settings, and internal warming system. It’s a good investment for someone who wants a versatile coffee maker without breaking the bank, but if long-term durability is a top priority, you might consider spending a bit more on a sturdier alternative.

The programmable settings let you have coffee ready when you wake up or come home, and the 1-4 cup brewing option is perfect when I’m the only one needing caffeine. However, the machine’s quirks, like the aforementioned pooling water and the slightly fragile build, make it better suited for those who prioritize convenience and unique features over bulletproof construction.

1igu5jp,https://www.reddit.com/r/swingtrading/comments/1igu5jp/how_to_win_in_trading_keep_going_after_everyone/,How to win in trading: keep going after everyone else stops,"Hi everyone,

I'm a husband, a dad of five, and a full-time trader.

Making the leap to full-time trading has been quite a journey, and along the way, I’ve picked up some concepts that have helped me navigate the ups and downs.

As I’ve been writing out these ideas for myself, I thought they might hopefully be encouraging to others—whether you're considering the transition to full-time trading or just looking to refine your approach. 

**Here's my post:**

Last week, I had coffee with an aspiring trader. The last time we talked, he was bursting with fresh ideas and eager to make his mark in the trading world.

But when I asked how things were going, and if he was still working toward making trading his full-time career, he hesitated.

""Trading was way harder than I expected,"" he said. ""I lost money and decided to stop. I tried stocks and options—options were cool, but I just couldn’t grasp it.

I realized it would take years to get good at this and I’m not ready to invest that kind of time right now. Maybe I’ll try again someday.""

Unfortunately, this reaction is all too common. But why is it the norm for so many?

Yes, the barrier to entry in trading is high—but here’s the thing: so is everything else.

For example: the average acceptance rate for Ivy League schools is under 4%. Only the top 8-10% of realtors make six figures. Just 5% of all Amazon sellers generate over $1 million in revenue. The reality is that the barrier to success in *any* field is high.

I don’t think trading is anything extraordinary. It’s not some mysterious ""boogeyman"" of business that's harder than other career paths. I believe it’s totally achievable for the person who truly wants it and is willing to put in the work—just like earning an Ivy League education, excelling in real estate, or hitting $1 million in Amazon sales. It all comes down to the individual and their commitment.

That’s why it’s frustrating to see new traders give in to self-doubt. So much potential gets derailed by short-term discouragement.

Today, I want to offer some encouragement. A career in trading isn’t just worth pursuing—it’s absolutely possible when built on the right foundation.

Let’s flip the script on this undeserved doubt and push your trading journey forward.

# The big problem with short term thinking

When I talk to struggling traders, or those hoping to transition to full-time, there’s a common theme: they view trading as a fast and easy path to riches. But in reality, it’s just like any other vocation or business.

Think about it—when else is taking the long road ever seen as a problem? Plumbers, dentists, real estate agents, and restaurant owners don’t have an issue with putting in the time and effort to get where they want to go.

What if we as traders adopted the same mindset?  
Trading is a business, after all.

What if, instead of thinking like most new traders who focus on days and weeks, we shifted to thinking in terms of months and years?

Whenever I face a decision, I like to ask myself: ""If I choose this path, what’s the alternative?"" In trading, the alternative to long-term thinking is, of course, short-term thinking—and that’s where the real problems start. This mindset can lead to things like:

* **Rushing to make a profit right away.** What if a restaurant tried this? They might cut corners by using cheap ingredients, skimp on marketing, skip employee training, and ignore the fundamentals—leading to few, if any, return customers.
* **Making quick decisions with large amounts of money, without the experience to back it up.** What if a new plumber took out a huge loan for tons of equipment and work trucks, without any real customers or business experience? Wouldn’t it make more sense to use what he has, build a customer base, and then figure out what tools he actually needs?
* **Jumping from one strategy to the next, without giving them enough time.** What if a real estate agent, looking for leads, tried knocking on doors in a local neighborhood for a few days, then gave up to focus on SEO for their website, just because they didn’t get immediate results? Had they stuck with the door-knocking strategy a little longer, they might have seen a lead come through and realized it was working.
* **Starting each business day without a clear process or routine.** Imagine a local dentist who had no set schedule, no patient records, and no clear steps for addressing patient needs. It would be chaos.

Notice a theme yet? *(Good things take time!)*  
Viewing trading as a long-term endeavor is what truly makes the difference.

# But what if you’re still stuck?

I know what you might be thinking: ""That sounds great, but I'm still scared. I’m afraid of starting and failing. I’m not in the right financial position to start a business, let alone trading.""

And that’s okay. You’re not alone. Every single trader, no matter their experience, feels that type of fear. Every day.

My heart still skips a beat when I see the clock ticking down to the opening bell, even after years of trading. Millions of people—wannabe traders and elite fund managers alike—feel the same way. That fear doesn’t disappear overnight. It may never go away completely, no matter what business you’re in.

But here’s my encouragement to you:

What you want is just on the other side of the unknown.

Every day you take a small step into the unknown, every time you take another trading rep, or make a small process improvement, they all add to your confidence to keep going. Because remember, you’re thinking long-term, just like a real business.

This is how you win.

# It's time to win

I know—words are nice—but how do you actually move forward? What are some practical steps you can use to move forward in your trading journey?

Let me put it this way: If you wanted to start a plumbing business, how would you ensure success, stay profitable, and keep going even when others have stopped?

1. **Start with the basics.** Use new information to help lower fear of the unknown. First, you’d figure out exactly what you need to start—certifications, tools, insurance, and so on. You’d probably watch a few YouTube videos from different people to get an overview of what it's like.

2. **Get hands-on practice.** Next, as an aspiring plumber, you’d start practicing with small jobs around the house or for close family, just to get those reps in and learn what it really takes. (This could look like taking small reps, I’m a big believer in one-share trades. Buy and sell one share only, until you have the data needed to show you where you’re profitable and you can start to scale.)
3. **Track everything.** As you go, you might write everything down. Maybe film or take pictures of each plumbing job so you can study them later. You’d track what you enjoy, what areas are low-stress and easy for you, and what mistakes you make—along with specific ways to fix them. (I like using Notion as a free way to start tracking things. Also Edgewonk is a great low-cost option.)
4. **Build a routine.** You then start forming a daily routine. You’d maybe go to class to learn the trade in the morning, do homework in the afternoon, and then maybe work on a small jobs for practice at night or on weekends. You’d then make adjustments each day, noting things like: *""I did poorly on my last exam because I stayed up too late. I’ll go to bed at 9 pm to focus better in class, as well as have more energy for my plumbing jobs.""*(In trading, this is what’s known as your “process”. Your routine that you follow, which you know gives you the best chance for success each day.)
5. **Repeat and improve.** The key in any business is repetition. You’d keep following the same steps every day until you get so good that you either have the pick of which plumbing company to work for, or, start your own business. Then assume it would take one to three years to get there. (This is when you find your “edge” — a repeatable trade setup that you know gives you positive expected value over time.)
6. **Bonus.** Along the way, you might only buy what you really need and try to practice frugality—no loans, using your own truck and tools, adding only as needed. This keeps the risk low while you learn and build your business. (This means keeping your costs and overhead low, in order to preserve and save up capital to trade with.

Opinions on trainer’s advice?,"I have a 1 y/o mini dachshund who has began showing signs of resource guarding. We believe this is due to us getting a new puppy (3 months ago) and the puppy taking his toys. At first, we didn’t think too much of it as the 1 y/o didn’t seem to mind as he would just find another toy to play with. I also think it could be due to me taking his toys away when he was close to destroying it. He has also never attacked the puppy or expressed that he didn’t like the puppy taking his toys away.

Fast forward to about a month ago, my dog lunged at my arm and bit me for trying to take away a Kong toy he was destroying. Before then, he had only lunged at us for trying to take away harmful things like chicken bones that he has found on walks or the one time he reached up at the coffee table and took one from a plate.

We then sent him to a board and train for 2 weeks after the Kong incident. The trainer taught him how to drop it and leave it. We are now working with our dog to enforce these habits and the main thing the trainer taught us was to always do a trade with the dog when he has a toy. This works well for most of his toys but is ineffective when it comes to other toys (higher valued toys).

For example, I bought him a pack of squeaky balls that he really loves. He will do fine with dropping it if he knows I will throw and alternate throwing with another ball. If he knows that play time is over and I will be taking the ball away, he will not drop. The other day, I even tried showing him a piece of turkey meat to trade and he refused. I had to squeak another ball and pull his leash for him to drop and leave the ball alone. Another example is if we leave him with a bone chew toy and he really gets into it, we will try to trade him for a treat but he will try to bite us as we’re taking away the bone while he’s chewing on the treat.

The trainer’s advice was to keep working on doing the trades with his regular toys for now and gradually build up to doing trades with chews/higher valued items. Is this good advice? I guess I’m having a hard time understanding that eventually he will be able to not be as guarded when it comes to chews. Before doing the training, he has also always been fine with us taking away toys of lesser value so I’m not sure how effective it is to continuously work on doing trades with lesser valued items then jump to doing higher valued ones. 

I would also like to add that we have put away all toys from shared areas with the dog and puppy. I’m looking more for advice on how I can work with my dog on his resource guarding. As I said, there are instances when he has gotten into things he’s not supposed to (like chicken bones) and in those instances, we have to take away these items he’s guarding.",2,1738602504.0,DogTrainingTips,1,1.0,False
1igu0um,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianPolitics/comments/1igu0um/green_party_leader_elizabeth_mays_letter_to_party/,Green Party leader Elizabeth May's letter to party members regarding the American situation.,"At 5:30pm ET today, Groundhog Day or Candlemas, depending on your tradition, all party leaders gathered through electronic means to reflect on Canada’s reaction to the unprecedented and illegal actions of US President Donald Trump.

The Prime Minister updated us on yesterday’s thought process, once President Trump made clear if Canada retaliated, he would make punishments more severe. Provincial premiers and Cabinet and other advisors felt this was not the time to back down. The Prime Minister shared that it had become increasingly clear that there was no evidence or further actions on border security that would make any difference. Trump would only double down. It was not really about fentanyl. It was about Canada and our sovereignty. All of us spoke to that point and agreed, Jagmeet Singh, Pierre Poilievre, Yves Francois Blanchet and me, although with differences, those need not be highlighted here. Our message was one of solidarity.

I told them all I was following through on an idea I shared when we last met on December 3, 2024, that the Washington DC National Prayer Breakfast (February 6, 2025) might be a good time for Canadian parliamentarians to go to Washington. In that sense I feel I now have a collective mandate from all leaders to bring a message to Washington that Canada is united in this.

With apologies to the leaders, I asked to share an anecdote. Something small but extraordinary in my experience. I was worshipping this morning at a Lutheran-Anglican church in Guelph, Ontario. As is the custom of many congregations, announcements come at the end of the service. An elderly gentlemen seemed not to be expected to go to the front of the church to make his own announcement. He said words to the effect of “I am so upset by what is happening. I want to be able to talk about it. I want to know that all Canadians will stand together. That we will stick together through whatever may come, O Canada is in our hymnal and I would like us all to sing it now.” Delicately the priest suggested that as the service was over, we should all move to the hall, and so, as coffee and tea were served in the fellowship part of the gathering, a congregation in Guelph stood and with lusty voices, and a few tears in our eyes, sang “O Canada!”. I suggested to the PM and other leaders that maybe there was a way to offer Canadians more specific ways they could sign up to help.

I also voiced my thanks.

The prime minister and Cabinet deserve our thanks, collectively. Premiers acting together deserve our thanks.

It was in my parents’ generation that ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances made sacrifices for the greater good. The thought of sacrifice has been unfashionable for quite a while. Immediate gratification is expected. Maybe now through collective strength and shared purpose we can persuade Mr. Trump to back down. Maybe.

But odds are this idiotic trade war may take some time. It is likely to do real damage to vulnerable people and small businesses that will need our help.

We are called upon to put country first. In that we agree that burdens across industries and regions be shared. We must ensure that those most vulnerable and living in the greatest precarity be attended to first. We must find ways to fund our collective and unified response to the US President, who yesterday broke a goodly number of treaties, international norms and laws.

We must remember that the US is full of people who disagree with their President. We must imagine that even someone who appears to be determined to do the wrong thing at every turn is capable of changing his mind.

All efforts must be made to stay friends and neighbours.

Still, we must not back down. We will likely have to do much more to protect Canada and others in Trump’s cross-hairs. We fear for those soon to be refugees, headed for an illegal detention camp at Guantanamo Bay or worse.

We need to respect and follow international law. We must build and fortify alliances – political, economic and diplomatic – defending those elements of multilateralism we once took for granted. Democracy and respect for human rights, climate action and collective work for a better world must not be abandoned.

We will not panic. Canada can emerge stronger, more resilient, more self-sufficient.

We do this together.

\---------------------------------------------------------

Lucas Voss stopped on the cracked sidewalk outside St. Michael’s in Old Town, his breath curling in the cool morning air. The building loomed before him, the brown stone steeple cutting into the cloud-heavy sky. Light spilled faintly from the stained glass windows, fractured into muted reds and blues on the pavement below. The faint echo of practiced hymns and murmured prayers seeped through the heavy wooden doors, underscored by the deep, hollow toll of a distant bell.

Lucas couldn’t fully place why he’d come. He hadn't been inside a church in over twenty years, not since his mother’s funeral. The thought of walking into one now felt almost absurd, but the anxiety he’d been carrying since those dreams began left him desperate. 

The church doors were massive and unyielding, just as they had been twenty years ago. The wood was still carved with the same intricate designs that he remembered. Designs that seemed to redden under the shifting morning light. 

Lucas hesitated, one hand resting on the worn brass handle. A faint memory surfaced: his father’s strong grip on his shoulder as a child, guiding him through those very doors, the smell of cologne mingling with his Sunday best. He shook his head, pushing the memory away and pulling the door open.

The air inside was surprisingly colder than he expected. The little draft in the vestibule carried with it the faint rustic scent of old stone and the lingering sweetness of incense. Before him stood the churches nave, cavernous and bright. Rows of dark wooden pews were arranged with meticulous precision, their surfaces polished to a dull sheen. Stained glass windows lined the walls, depicting saints and martyrs, their faces serene yet unnervingly focused. Candles flickered along the walls, their flames trembling as if in rhythm with the faint murmur of the parishioners.

Lucas stepped inside, the door creaking shut behind him with a low groan that echoed throughout the space. He slid into the last pew, his movements tentative and uncomfortable. He glanced around, noting the sparse congregation—mostly older couples, their heads bowed in reverence. A few scattered figures stood at the votive candle stands near the altar, their faces obscured by the shifting shadows of the candlelight.

The sound of footsteps behind him drew his attention. A woman in her sixties shuffled past, her rosary beads clicking softly as she moved to the front to light a candle with the others. Her face was lined with years of devotion, her expression reflecting the same purpose as the saints in the glass. Lucas envied her conviction, the quiet certainty she seemed to carry with her like a shield. He had none of that—not anymore.

He allowed his hands to purchase onto the worn wood of the pew in front of him, the grain smooth and cool under his fingertips. The faint strains of an organ drifted through the air as the service began in earnest. Lucas found himself standing alongside the other parishioners to watch the processional cross proceed through the central aisle towards the altar. After a brief moment, the priest took his place and the mass truly began. 

It wasn't long before the halls of the church were filled with the deep, resonant voice of the priest. His words recited the liturgical hymns of the day. The verses were both familiar yet profoundly distant to Lucas, their meaning dulled by time and pain. Yet he found himself mouthing along out of habit, the phrases forming on his lips before his mind could process them.

“Kyrie eleison. Christe eleison.”

The phrases hung in the air, ancient and heavy. He closed his eyes, exhaling slowly as he tried to let the ritual’s rhythm soothe him. Instead, his thoughts spiraled back to the lab, to the rat’s coiled flesh and the dark residue left behind in the incinerator. And even to the faint sensation of itchiness under his own skin, though he knew that was just his imagination. He had hoped, anyway.

When Lucas opened his eyes again, his gaze drifted upward. The vaulted ceiling loomed high above, its detailed etchings obscured by shadow. He traced the lines of the stained glass windows with his eyes, each panel telling a fragmented story. One in particular caught his attention, its colors more vibrant than the rest. It depicted a scene from the Book of Revelation: a swirling maelstrom of fire and light, surrounded by angelic figures with inhumanly vivid eyes. At its center was a great, unknowable form, its edges indistinct as though the artist had been unable—or unwilling—to define it.

Lucas’s throat tightened, and he looked away, the image burned into his mind. He focused instead on the altar, its surface adorned with gilded crosses and ornate candelabras. The priest stood behind it, his voice a steady drone that filled the space. The congregation shifted, sometimes standing, sometimes kneeling. Lucas had remained seated.

He leaned back, his head tilted upwards again. His mind drifted to his parents, their unwavering faith that had seemed so foreign to him even as a child. His father’s booming voice as he recited the Nicene Creed, his mother’s quiet prayers as she lit a candle for every lost soul she could remember. They’d believed in something greater, something eternal. Lucas had abandoned all of that long ago, choosing reason over ritual, science over scripture. And yet, here he was, acquiescing. 

The organ swelled, its deep notes reverberating through the church. The congregation rose again, their voices joining in a hymn. Lucas hesitated, then finally stood with them, his movements stiff and forced. He didn’t sing, just watched as the others swayed to the music, their eyes closed. A man in the row ahead of him clasped his hands tightly together in a physical manifestation of prayer. Lucas watched him mumble along with the priest's words.

Eventually he let his gaze drift back towards the votive candles near the altar. Their flames flickered in unison, tiny points of light that seemed fragile against the overwhelming openness of the space. He thought about lighting one, though he wasn’t sure why. Maybe for his mother. It wouldn’t change anything. It wouldn’t bring him peace or answers. But it might do… something. 

As the hymn ended, the priest stepped forward, his voice rising above the murmurs of the congregation. “Let us pray,” he intoned, his words practiced and easy. The congregation bowed their heads, and Lucas followed suit. 

When the prayer ended, Lucas sank back into the pew, his hands clasped loosely in his lap. He closed his eyes, the dim hum of the church filling his ears. He didn’t feel peace, not really. But for the first time in days, he felt still. And that, he decided, was enough.

Lucas sat in that spot long after the final hymn had ended. The congregation had dispersed in a slow trickle, leaving behind only the faint scent of incense and the receeding echo of footsteps. The vast emptiness of the church amplified every small sound—the rustle of his jacket as he shifted, the creak of the wood beneath him, the faint whisper of the breeze moving through the high, vaulted space.

He allowed his thoughts to spiral, as they had been wanting to do since his first dream. The visions they had given him were seared into his mind, every image vivid and overwhelming. He could still feel the weight of the entity’s presence, the echo of that alien rhythm thrumming in his chest. 

He leaned forward, elbows on his knees, and rubbed his face with his hands. The rough texture of his palms against his skin grounded him for a moment, but the weight in his chest didn’t lift.

“What am I even doing here?” he muttered to himself.

His voice barely carried in the cavernous room, but it was enough to draw the attention of someone. A soft voice broke the silence behind him. “You look troubled.”

Lucas turned sharply, startled. The priest stood a few feet away, his hands folded neatly in front of him. He was older, with silver-threaded hair and a face etched with lines crafted from countlessly taxing years. His black cassock was worn but clean, the white collar crisp against his skin.

“Sorry,” Lucas said, sitting up straighter. “I didn’t realize anyone was still here.”

The priest offered a small smile. “There’s always someone here if you look hard enough.” He gestured to the pew across from Lucas. “May I?”

Lucas hesitated, then nodded. “Sure.”

The priest sat down, his movements calm and labored. For a moment, he said nothing, simply studying Lucas with a gaze that was neither probing nor invasive. When he finally spoke, his tone was gentle. “It’s not often we see new faces. What brings you here?”

Lucas glanced around, unsure how to answer. “I’m not really sure,” he admitted. “I don’t… usually do this kind of thing.”

“The kind of thing where you sit quietly and think?” The priest’s eyes glimmered with a faint hint of humor. “Or the kind where you come to church?”

“Both,” Lucas said, managing a weak smile. He looked down at his hands, his fingers idly tracing the grain of the wood. “I guess I just needed somewhere to… sort things out.”

The priest nodded, as if this made perfect sense. “And have you?”

Lucas laughed softly, though there was no humor in it. “Not really. If anything, I think I’m more confused than when I came in.”

The priest leaned back slightly. “Confusion is often the first step. It means you’ve started asking questions that need to be answered.”

Lucas glanced at him, unsure how much he wanted to share. But something about the man’s presence made the words flow freely out of his mouth. 

“I’ve been having these dreams,” he said slowly. “Or maybe they’re more like… nightmares. They don’t feel like regular dreams. They’re too detailed, too… real.”

The priest’s brow furrowed, but he said nothing, allowing Lucas to continue.

“They’re more than just weird imaginations,” Lucas said, his voice lowering. “They’re… urgent. Like they’re trying to tell me something. Or warn me about something. But the images they show me—they don’t make sense.”

The priest rested his hands lightly on his lap. “Dreams can often feel real, especially when they touch on something deep within us. The mind has a way of revealing truths we’d rather ignore.”

Lucas shifted uncomfortably. “It doesn’t feel like that. It feels… external. Like it’s coming from somewhere else.”

The priest’s expression didn’t change, but his eyes grew more focused. “What do you mean by that?”

Lucas hesitated. He wanted to dismiss the question, to avoid saying what had been gnawing at him. But the words spilled out before he could stop them. “That something’s coming. Something bigger than me, bigger than anything I can understand.”

The priest leaned forward slightly, his eyes attentive. “Do you feel fear when you dream of these things? Or is it something else?”

Lucas considered this, his fingers tightening against the wood of the pew. “Fear, yes, but it’s not just that. It’s… insignificance. Like whatever I’m seeing, whatever these things are, they’re beyond anything I can understand. They’re vast, old. And I’m nothing to them.”

The priest was silent for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was softer, tinged with something Lucas couldn’t quite place. “Scripture and tradition warns us of angels and demons, of forces that work beyond human understanding. Some are messengers of God, others adversaries to His creation. Could it be that what you’ve seen falls into these realms?”

Lucas frowned. “I don’t know. It doesn’t feel… divine. It’s more… indifferent. Like it doesn’t care about us at all.”

“Indifference can be more terrifying than malice,” the priest said, his tone somber. “But even in the face of such vastness, we are not without hope.”

Lucas shifted uncomfortably. “I’m not exactly the faithful type.”

“Faith doesn’t require certainty,” the priest replied. “It begins with questions. Our questions, paired with a softened heart, provide fertile soil for the truth to bloom.”

Lucas looked at him, trying to gauge whether the man truly believed what he was saying or if it was just the comforting platitudes of a career in ministry. But the priest’s face was calm, unwavering.

“What do I do with this?” Lucas asked after a long silence. “These thoughts—this feeling. It’s consuming me. I can’t think straight, I can’t focus. It’s like it’s… unraveling my mind.”

The priest’s expression darkened, his voice lowering. “Evil exists. It always has. But so does good. And sometimes, the line between them isn’t as clear as we’d like it to be. That’s why we seek guidance.”

Lucas stared at the stained glass windows ahead, the swirling figures of Revelation seeming to glimmer in the dim light. “I’m not sure guidance will help with this.”

“Perhaps not,” the priest said. “But you came here for a reason. You don’t have to face this alone. Whatever it is you’re struggling with, there are others who can help—people who care about you, who can support you.”

Lucas thought of Evelyn and Tessa. “I don’t even know where to start,” he admitted.

The priest smiled faintly. “Start here. With a prayer, if you’re willing.”

Lucas hesitated, his skepticism warring with the faint glimmer of hope that the suggestion sparked. “I don’t really remember how any of that works.”

“I’ll guide you,” the priest said simply. He folded his hands, bowing his head slightly. Lucas mirrored the gesture, his movements rigid and strained.

“Lord,” the priest began, his voice steady, “we come before You seeking clarity in the midst of confusion, strength in the face of fear, and guidance in the darkness. For your adopted child, who carries burdens he cannot yet name, we ask Your light to shine upon his path. Grant him the courage to face the unknown and the wisdom to discern the truth.”

Lucas closed his eyes, the words washing over him like a distant tide. He didn’t believe—not really—but for a moment, he allowed himself to feel the weight of the prayer, the distant thought that it might somehow help.

When the priest finished, Lucas opened his eyes. “Thanks,” he said quietly, his words barely leaving his lips.

The priest nodded. “You’re always welcome here. Whether you’re looking for answers or just a quiet place to think.”

Lucas stood, his legs stiff from sitting too long. He glanced at the stained glass window one last time before turning toward the door. The priest watched him go.

As Lucas stepped out into the frigid early afternoon air, the church bells tolled again, their deep, resonant sound following him down the street. The weight in his chest hadn’t lifted, but it felt… different. Not lighter, exactly, but less suffocating. And that would have to do. 

He reached into his pocket and took out his phone. A few quick flicks pulled up Evelyn’s number. He sighed and pressed her name.

—

Lucas sat at a small, worn laminate table in a corner booth at Salinger’s, a neighborhood restaurant just a few blocks from campus. The air smelled of frying oil and fresh bread, and the muted hum of conversation filled the dining area, punctuated by the occasional clang of silverware against plates. 

A half-empty glass of water sat in front of him, the condensation pooling in small, uneven circles on the table. He glanced at the door for the third time in as many minutes, then at the digital clock on his phone. Evelyn wasn’t running late. Not yet. But she was getting close.

Just as he began to wonder if she’d stood him up, the door swung open, and she walked in. Her black jacket was slightly damp from the misting rain outside, and her hair was tied back in a loose ponytail. She scanned the room, spotted him, and made her way over.

“You’re early,” Evelyn said, sliding into the booth opposite him.

“And you’re punctual,” Lucas replied, a small smile tugging at his lips. “Guess we’ll never change.”

A server approached almost immediately, a young man with a tired but pleasant demeanor. Evelyn ordered coffee, black, while Lucas asked for a refill of his water. Once the server walked away, Evelyn leaned back in her seat, studying Lucas with a look that was both curious and appraising.

“So,” she said, folding her arms on the table. “You sounded… tense on the phone. Everything okay?”

Lucas hesitated. He wasn’t sure where to start or how much to say. “I guess I just needed to talk things through,” he admitted finally. “Everything we’ve been working on, everything we’ve seen—it’s… it’s a lot.”

The restaurant buzzed with muted activity as Lucas leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table. The clinking of utensils and the low hum of conversation created a cocoon of white noise around them. Outside, the rain had picked up, streaking the windows with thin rivulets. Lucas stared at the table for a moment, gathering his thoughts.

Evelyn tilted her head, her expression softening. “Yeah, it is.” She glanced at the menu but didn’t open it, her fingers idly tracing the edge of the laminated page. “But you don’t usually call for lunch meetings when you’re feeling overwhelmed. What’s really on your mind?”

Lucas leaned forward, resting his arms on the table as Evelyn studied him with quiet curiosity. The warm, ambient lighting of the restaurant softened the lines of her face, making her look more at ease than she had in days.

Lucas shifted in his seat, his hand idly fidgeting with the corner of his napkin. “I don’t even know where to start,” he admitted. “It’s not just work—it’s everything. I’ve been having these… dreams. They’re not normal dreams, Evelyn. They feel like they’re connected to all of this.”

Evelyn frowned slightly but didn’t interrupt. Instead, she leaned forward, her interest evident. “Dreams?” she asked. “What kind of dreams?”

Before he could answer, the server appeared with their drinks. Evelyn wrapped her hands around her coffee mug, taking a tentative sip. A small grimace flickered across her face as the bitterness hit, but she recovered quickly. They placed their orders before Evelyn motioned for Lucas to continue.

“They’re a lot to explain,” Lucas said, his voice low. “I see things that don’t make sense—cities folding into themselves, landscapes shifting like they’re alive. And then there's this… presence. It’s not something I can see, but I feel it. Like it’s watching. Waiting.”

Evelyn leaned back slightly, her brow furrowing. “That sounds… unsettling,” she said. “How often does it happen?”

“its been every night for the last few days,” Lucas replied, the exhaustion clear in his voice. “It’s like they're following me. And the strangest part is, everything we’ve been working on—those mutations, the transformations—it’s like I’ve seen it all before. In the dreams, in my head.”

Evelyn’s fingers tapped lightly against her mug. “You’re not imagining it,” she said after a pause.

Lucas blinked, caught off guard. “What do you mean?”

She hesitated for a moment, as if debating whether to continue. Then she sighed. “I’ve been having dreams, too. Not exactly like yours, but similar enough. Spirals, shifting shapes, that sense of something just beyond my reach.” She paused, taking another sip of her coffee. “But they don’t bother me the way they seem to bother you.”

Lucas stared at her, his expression a mix of disbelief and shock. “How are you not freaked out by that? Doesn’t it feel… wrong?”

Evelyn gave a small shrug, her lips curving into a faint, almost apologetic smile. “I guess they just don’t upset me the way they upset you. They feel… natural. Like we’re supposed to see them.”

“Natural?” Lucas repeated, his voice tinged with disbelief. “There’s nothing natural about this.”

“I’m just trying to say that it doesn’t feel wrong to me,” she said, her tone calm. “It feels essential. Like we’re seeing the first piece of the big picture for the first time.”

Lucas shook his head, leaning back in his chair. “That doesn’t make this any less terrifying. Evelyn, we’re not just studying this thing—it’s affecting us. Changing how we dream, maybe even how we think. Doesn’t that worry you?”

She set her mug down and folded her hands on the table. “Of course it worries me. But fear doesn’t mean we run from it. It means we face it, understand it.”

Lucas rubbed his temples, frustration flickering across his features. “You make it sound so simple.”

“Because overthinking won’t solve this,” Evelyn replied, her voice soft but firm. “Whatever this is, it’s happening whether we like it or not. Ignoring it isn’t going to help.”

The server returned, setting down their plates. Evelyn ordered a Caesar salad, its vibrant greens contrasting with the warm croutons and pale dressing. Lucas had chosen a turkey club sandwich, though now he found his appetite lacking. They murmured thanks to the server before returning to their conversation.

Lucas pushed his plate aside slightly, leaning toward Evelyn. “You really think this thing has some sort of greater agenda? That it’s acting with some type of intelligence we can understand?”

“I do,” Evelyn said, spearing a piece of lettuce with her fork. “Everything we’ve seen points to it. Those cells—they’re not just adapting. They’re transforming their environment. Shaping it into something that suits them.”

“Something compatible,” Lucas murmured. His fingers drummed against the edge of the table as the thought sank in. “Compatible with what, though? Or… for what?”

Evelyn paused, her fork hovering over her plate. “That’s the question, isn’t it? And it’s not one we can answer yet.”

Lucas glanced out the window, watching as raindrops streaked down the glass in chaotic patterns. The gray sky mirrored the weight in his chest. “What if we’re part of the equation? What if we’re accelerating whatever it’s trying to do?”

Evelyn’s expression darkened. “I’ve thought about that,” she admitted. “But what’s the alternative? Pretend it’s not happening? Hope it just goes away? That’s not an option.”

“And if this spreads?” Lucas pressed. “If it gets beyond us? What then?”

Evelyn’s gaze sharpened. “Then we deal with it. We figure out how to slow it down, stop it if we have to. But we can’t do that without understanding it.”

The hum of the restaurant seemed to fade as they fell into silence. Lucas picked up his glass, watching the condensation drip down its sides. The question that had been gnawing at him finally surfaced.

“Do you think it's capable of reason?” he asked quietly.

Evelyn considered the question for a moment, her fingers lightly tracing the edge of her plate. Outside, the rain began to downpour, droplets streaking down the glass in erratic patterns. “I don’t know,” she said finally. “But whatever it is, I don’t think it’s malicious.”

Lucas raised an eyebrow. “You don’t?”

She shook her head. “No. It’s not like it’s attacking us. It’s just… existing. Expanding. Adapting. It’s doing what life does.”

Lucas exhaled, setting his glass down with a faint clink. “And what about us? What do you think our purpose is in its plan?”

Evelyn looked at him, her expression softening. “I don’t know,” she said honestly. “But I think we have a responsibility to figure it out.”

Her words hung in the air, heavy and unshakable. Lucas rubbed the back of his neck, his mind churning with unanswered questions.

“You’re taking this a lot better than I am,” he said, his voice rough.

Evelyn gave a small smile. “Maybe. Or maybe I’ve just accepted that there’s no turning back. We’re just pieces in a much larger puzzle.”

“That doesn’t exactly inspire confidence,” Lucas muttered.

“It’s not about confidence,” Evelyn replied. “It’s about facing reality. If we don’t, who will?”

Lucas stared at her, trying to read the mix of determination and vulnerability in her expression. Her calmness unnerved him as much as it reassured him.

“Dreams aside, what do you think it’s building?” he asked after a long pause. “Those cells, the way they restructure everything—it’s like they’re creating something. But for what?”

Evelyn took a slow breath, her gaze drifting to the window. “I don’t know,” she said softly.

“And what about containment? If this thing is as adaptive as we think, how do we keep it from spreading beyond what we’ve already seen?”

Evelyn swallowed a bite of her salad, her expression turning grim. “The cells are already in the environment—water systems, soil, maybe even the air. Containment might not even be possible at this point.”

“So what do we do? Just watch it happen?”

“No,” Evelyn said firmly. “We keep an eye on it. We look for weaknesses, for patterns we can exploit. There has to be a way to stop it—or at least slow it down if we need to.”

Lucas studied her for a moment, his eyes searching hers. “And if there isn’t?”

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. “Then we figure out how to live with it.”

The simplicity of her statement hit Lucas harder than he expected. He leaned back in his seat, running a hand through his hair. “This is starting to feel less like private research and more like a survival strategy.”

Evelyn nodded, her gaze steady. “It’s both. And if we’re going to make it through this, we have to stay focused. No distractions, no second-guessing. Agreed?”

Lucas hesitated, then nodded. “Agreed.”

They finished their meal in relative silence, the weight of their conversation leaving little room for small talk. When the check came, Evelyn insisted on paying, waving off Lucas’s protests.

“Consider it a thank-you,” she said as they stood to leave.

“For what?” Lucas asked, holding the door open for her.

“For keeping me sane,” she replied, stepping out into the misting rain. “At least, as sane as I can be given the circumstances.”

Lucas managed a faint smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “See you at the lab tomorrow?”

“I’ve got something I need to do first. But, soon, I’m sure.” Evenlyn returned the smile and left towards her car.",16,1738602393.0,StrangeAccounts,0,1.0,False

I find that when using a single wall basket, the pressure dial barely moves, and the coffee lacks crema. This is true even if I set to grind to the finest setting, and tamp with extra pressure. 
If I install a dual wall basket, the pressure gauge gets up to where is should go.

Is this just a sign that the grinder in the barista brew is not very good? Could my choice of beans be causing the problem (Lavazza Super Crema)? Portafilter basket too big (double shot)?",1,1738602351.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

**[Check Full Pricing Here](https://5starchoices.com/best-coffee-maker-with-frother/)**

**CHULUX Kom-Pro Espresso Machine**  
- 20-bar pressure for rich crema  
- 30-second heat-up time  
- Compact 5.6” width  

Ideal for espresso purists. The steam wand creates microfoam for latte art.  

**Ninja Hot and Cold Brewed System**  
- Cold brew in 10 minutes  
- Auto-iQ smart brewing  
- Separate tea/coffee baskets  

Great for iced coffee lovers. Frother works with dairy and plant-based milks.

**Pro Tip**  
Grind beans finer for CHULUX to get that caramel-colored crema. Coarser works better with Ninja’s cold brew.  

**Real Talk**  
Keurig’s pod system costs more per cup. CHULUX needs fresh beans. Mr. Coffee’s plastic parts feel cheap but get the job done.  

**Last Call**  
Want lattes daily? Keurig K-Cafe. Crave real espresso? CHULUX. Tight budget? Mr. Coffee.

1igtveu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DividendPower/comments/1igtveu/coffee_stocks_with_dividends_perk_up_your/,Coffee Stocks with Dividends: Perk Up Your Portfolio,"Coffee stocks have been lucrative for investors. For instance, Starbucks (SBUX) has made millionaires since its initial public offering (IPO). The company had an IPO on June 26, 1992, and if $10,000 was invested, it bought about 588 shares. It is worth more than $4 million now after six splits without even considering the dividends.

However, Starbucks is not the only choice for investors. Today, there are many coffee stocks to choose from, including retailers, processors, and distributors. A few companies are focused mainly on coffee, like Starbucks. Other coffee companies have a business segment in a more extensive product portfolio, like Keurig Dr. Pepper (KDP). Finally, some companies produce and sell coffee as part of a giant conglomerate, like Nestle (NSRGY). 

There is room for many companies in this $100 billion industry driven by consumers [drinking](https://joesgaragecoffee.com/blog/coffee-drinking-statistics/) 146+ billion cups of coffee annually. A handful of publicly traded companies make excellent investments at the appropriate valuation. In addition, there are several smaller coffee stocks. However, investors should be wary of many of these since they are often micro-caps with more significant risks and volatility. Lastly, there are many many privately-held coffee companies. For instance, Dunkin’ Donuts is now owned by a [**private equity firm**](https://www.dividendpower.org/what-is-private-equity/).

There is some nausea, but not enough to warrant remedies yet. The worst symptom right now is just sheer exhaustion. It feels like I need to close my eyes and lay down every 5 minutes.

Are there any known raspberry pi projects similar to the Naked Portafilter - Smart Espresso Profiler? Basically something that has a connection to a pressure gauge, a scale, and into some sort of display to graph pressure, and weight over time. ideally maybe save brew profiles and import good profiles to mimic. I am not a developer or an extreme coffee nerd to develop any of this from the ground up but i can copy paste code like a champ! with my amazing googling skills some sort of ideal scenario of an MVP would be:

wired Pressure gauge
wired scale
wire raspberry pi zero 2w, maybe raspberry pi 4 or 5
w ink display w/ minimal UI, but enough to see the graphs, any other relevant info
minimal buttons on the display to save profiles, and select profiles to replicate
an additional unicorn wish list would be:

temperature sensors at the bowl
Phone app to communicate w/ RPi
easy loading of software on a MicroSD card
more data logging capabilities to describe coffee, grind size, grinder, water quality, etc
As an alternative, is there anyone w/ better skills than mine to help get this together?

Protein shake around 11am.  Lunch at 1pm (usually leftovers, but sometimes Thai lunch or Greek plate from work with lots of protein and rice).  Small snack around 4pm before my crossfit class.  After crossfit I'll either have a protein shake, or dinner.  If I have a shake, I'll have a large dinner later on, and then a snack like chips and salsa or popcorn for the evening. I like Greek yogurt too, like Chobani.  On weekends, I tend to eat a very large meal during the day, with my protein shake later on and snacks.  I never eat fast food, can't stand it.  I go out to eat maybe once per week, though, usually a nice restaurant.  I don't drink, I get some sugar from ice cream a few times per week.  I love my suger-free energy drinks.  I have 2 per day (I don't really like the taste of coffee), and maybe a diet pepsi as well.  I should probably track my calories, but I make most of my meals from scratch, and that is too time-consuming for me.  I try to estimate that I get about 2000 - 2300 calories per day, and at least 150g of protein.  I weigh about 160 lbs. 

 I guess the key point in my diet is that I tend to eat a very large meal every day, and sustain myself with protein shakes or small snacks the rest of the day.  I never thought much about my diet, except just to get enough protein.  I'm wondering if my lifestyle is very healthy for going to crossfit 5x a week plus skill work.  I tend to need a lot of naps on the weekends, but during the week I am fine with the load.  I walk throughout my day at work mostly.  Would I be better off with more meals every day?  I have always skipped breakfast since I was a little kid, and I tend to intermittent fast just by convenience (12-14 hours, almost never more than that).  Feeling just TIRED lately, but I'm attributing that to being in my 40's and working out 5x a week.

My favourite memory of you was our morning routine. I would come downstairs and make a coffee, everyone else still in bed. I’d sit in my chair, and you would come to me and stretch up for me to pick you up. I would, and I’d give you a big hug and kiss before you settled in my lap for a nap while I had my coffee and read. Every morning without fail. I now think of you every morning, and wish you were still here. 

Some things Fozzie loved: stealing socks, stinky breath (he loves to give gentle licks if you had stinky breath!), antagonizing Chewie, snuggling on someone’s lap, food (of course), being outside, barking at the TV, and his family.

I am looking for a comprehensive repository of books authored by Indian writers, either translated into English or available in their original languages. My primary focus is on literature that explores:

* Policies enacted during British India
* Post-independence Indian governance
* Commentary on governmental policies
* Indian history
* Books exploring societal norms in India
* Research studies conducted by various Indian government departments focusing on specific societal needs
* Studies on different Indian tribes and their ecological environments

# My Efforts So Far:

I have attempted to access book titles from various national libraries, primarily in North Indian cities. However, I was denied access to complete lists. The only significant resource I could explore was the **Central Secretariat Library (CSL) in Delhi.** Several other libraries impose membership fees and other charges, even for accessing book titles.

Through my research, I came across the following online resources that provide book listings—but only if one already knows what they are searching for:

1. [**National Digital Library of India**](https://www.ndl.gov.in/ndl_lw)
2. [**Central Secretariat Library OPAC**](https://cslopac.nvli.in/)
3. [**Indian Culture - Rare Books (Central Secretariat Library)**](https://indianculture.gov.in/rarebooks?f%5B0%5D=rarebook_organisations%3ACentral%20Secretariat%20Library) – The only OPAC system sharing rare book information
4. [**National Library of India OPAC**](https://nationallibraryopac.nvli.in/)

Despite these efforts, I have not been able to find a freely available, consolidated list of such books.

# Request for Assistance:

Does anyone have a curated list of notable books by Indian authors covering Indian culture, history, and society? Language is not a constraint—I am open to books in any Indian language or their English translations.

I am particularly interested in firsthand recommendations from individuals who have personally attempted to gather such information. Kindly refrain from using AI-generated responses, as I am looking for genuine insights.

Your suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

P.S. I am attaching a list of books that cover approximately 150 years of WORLD history, specifically curated for an American audience.

1igtin5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/1igtin5/am_i_astral_projecting/,Am I Astral Projecting?,"For the past 2 nights, I have been experiencing a weird phenomenon.

I will be in deep sleep, not dreaming, but not awake. All I see is black because my eyes are closed. I know I am sleeping, but I also am aware of my surroundings. Specifically, I can hear things happening in my kitchen as if I am right next to them. 

To give you some context, I don't hear well. I wear hearing aids off and on, but they are never on when I sleep. I can barely hear things that happen in the same room as me when I am awake. There is no possibility that I will hear something in another room. And there is especially no possibility that I will hear things in my sleep.

However, 2 nights ago, I heard my husband whisper ""aw dang!"" To himself in the kitchen, as if he were right next to me. It was around 4:30am, I know this bc that's when my husband makes his coffee, I did not physically wake up and check the time because I was in deep sleep. I asked him about it when I woke up later. I said ""did you say 'aw dang!' To yourself this morning in the kitchen?"" He was taken aback and said, ""yea how did you know?""
I told him I heard it loud and clear, and I could tell he was shocked.

Last night, I heard a crash in the kitchen. But again, I was in deep sleep, only seeing black, yet had this hyper-hearing as if I was right next to the crash. I just somehow ""knew"" it was 3:30am. I went out the next morning and saw one of my decorative vases was on the floor. To me, this was incredibly weird for 2 reasons. The first reason, the vase has gone untouched for awhile on top of a 5 foot mantle, why would it randomly fall in the middle of the night? The second reason, I don't hear well, so how did I hear it clear as day?!

I racked my brain and am possibly considering that I might have somehow astral projected??? What are your thoughts?

We texted for a few days but I didn’t feel any chemistry so I respectfully ended it with her. She was disappointed when I called it off, but I was upfront with her and respectful.  
  
Fast forward 10 years later, I’ve been with my now wife (41F) for 8 years and married for 1.5 years. Out of nowhere, Cindy creates a fake FB account, sends a FB message to my wife and claims that I am cheating. I am not cheating, nor have I ever cheated on my wife.

At the same time, Cindy messages me from the fake FB account to try and hook-up with me again.

My wife and I showed each other these messages – Cindy does not know this part.

My wife asks Cindy for proof but Cindy cannot provide proof. Cindy sends a message about 3-4 times per week to my wife. We have no idea why she is doing this. I have a feeling that she probably got out of bad relationship recently and wants to take it out on anyone and everyone.

My wife is 100% on my side and knows that I have never cheated on her.  I have nothing to hide and my wife has access to all my emails and social media messages.

My wife is not handling this well. Even though she knows I’m not cheating, her mental health is suffering big time. My wife throws up every time that she gets a message from Cindy. Cindy is trying to sabotage my marriage and my life.

Unfortunately, I do not remember Cindy’s real name or anything about her.

Besides blocking Cindy on FB, what are our options to make her stop?

**TL;DR:** 10 years ago, I (39M) briefly dated Cindy (31F) but ended it respectfully due to no chemistry. Now, Cindy has resurfaced using a fake FB account, falsely accusing me of cheating and trying to hook up again. She sends my wife (41F) multiple messages per week, causing her severe distress. My wife knows I’m faithful, but this is taking a toll on her mental health. Cindy cannot provide proof and seems to be lashing out for unknown reasons. I don’t remember Cindy’s real name.

Hi, I've been struggling with my espresso extractions for a while now, and the results aren't quite satisfying. The taste comes across as more bitter than usual, and I'm no longer experiencing the flavors I was accustomed to.

Despite switching beans and roasters, the poor results persist.

I've noticed that about halfway through the extraction, the flow forms an unusual (elongated) tail. When I examine the puck, I often see channeling, and the center is uneven or pressed down.

I’ve tried a coarser grind, but then I end up with 40g in the cup in 22-23 seconds, which is too fast. I don't believe a finer grind would solve this issue either.

Here’s my setup and preparation: Lelit Bianca (set to 8 bars), Niche Zero, Lelit basket by IMS, 18 grams of beans, targeting 35-40 ml in 25-30 seconds. I’m using a brewing temperature of 93°C (200°F). I also use WDT and a Normcore spring-loaded tamper. Currently, I'm using a medium roast Ethiopian coffee.

What else can I try? I'm starting to feel a bit discouraged.

1igtcuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/davidlynch/comments/1igtcuc/17_days_later_how_are_you_doing/,17 days later: how are you doing?,"Like so many of you, I was hit hard by the news. There’s no need to get into the grisly details, but I was taken aback by the scale and intensity of my own grief. 

I refused to entertain any suggestion that grief on that level was inappropriate for a so-called “celebrity I didn’t know”. The way I see it: If someone made so much of an impact on your life to the extent that you thought about them and their work every day for the last twenty years, and there was a decided shift in how you understood your existence and created art after encountering his, how could you not feel this way?

17 days later, my grief has transformed into something sobering, radically positive, and re-orienting. It’s hard to describe. I think about David the person more than ever, but I don’t feel the intolerable sadness I did before. 

Prior to his death, I’d seen scattered footage of his interviews and was familiar with some of his quotes, but that was the extent of it other than his filmography and photography, and my love of the *Angriest Dog in the World*. 

I now have my partner’s copy of *Catching the Big Fish* on my coffee table. I’ve found that reading the book intuitively rather than chronologically makes the most sense. I started by reading the table of contents and flipping to a chapter that caught my attention. Now I open it to a random page whenever I am sitting on the couch, and there’s always something new in it for me that I learn from, even if I’ve read the page before. 

In retrospect, I shied away from reading it because I was afraid that it would read like a generic celebrity self-help book and take away from the impression I had of him. But I think there is real wisdom and clarity in it. 

I’m listening to *Room to Dream*. I’m not even halfway through, but both books have already given me a whole new perspective on David’s method and core beliefs. What strikes me is how remarkably consistent he is in the framework he gives you for understanding his work. It is delightfully straightforward, and yet it clicks perfectly in my head. 

Personal takeaways: I am much more deliberate in my everyday choices and present in my surroundings. I am consciously attuned to my own likes and dislikes. I take seriously that seemingly trivial everyday encounters can be vital sources of creative inspiration. I’ve always thought and worked “intuitively” and was surprised to see David describe the same process so mechanically, not as something haphazard or ad-hoc but legitimate in its own right. I love his willingness to deem so many things beautiful, and I feel much more attuned to the beauty around me, knowing that it is not an antidote to the ugliness but co-exists with it. 

I thank this community so much for giving me a space to appreciate him and being such an incredible source for material about his life and work. More than that, it makes me so happy to see just extensive David’s influence has been, and how his legacy is more alive than ever.

* what and when I eat, 
* when I take meds, 
* when and how much I drink coffee, 
* when I crash, 
* and the effective period of symptom relief. 

I discovered somewhat accidentally that coffee really affects both the duration and the amplitude of the crash. I confirmed this through experimentation, and I feel like I have an explanation.



Here's the ""facts"" that I believe are accurate:

* Coffee speeds up your metabolism, including how fast the med is processed into your bloodstream. I don't know if it has any effect on conversion rate from lis-dexamphetamine to dexamphetamine.
* Coffee also speeds up how fast you eliminate everything from your body, so you are also pissing it out faster.
* The therapeutic effect of stimulants is not based purely on blood concentration, it is also a matter of the rate at which the levels go up and down. Somebody recently talked about this here in a comment on another post.

For example, 20 mg may work great on the way up, and a slow transition from 20 mg up to 50 mg peak concentration of amphetamine in your blood may feel like a mild uptick, but a sharp drop from 50 mg to 30 mg in 30 minutes will feel like a crash even though 30 mg is more than the 20 that worked well for you on the way up.  A gradual decline from 50 to 30 over 2 hours will feel fine, however. These numbers are for example only and not precise, I'm just trying to get the point across that the rate of decline is critical. Also, the faster you go up, the more sensitive you are to going down.

This means that coffee, and probably other stimulants, reduces the duration and causes the crash by:

1. Actually removing it from your system faster
2. Making the quantity in your system less effective due to the roller coaster of going up and down too fast.

  
What I have found to be effective for me is to:

* Not take meds until at least 3 hours have passed since I finished my last cup of coffee.
* Do not drink coffee during the day because this will actually reduce the duration and cause a crash later.
* If you take a booster, take the smaller dose with your coffee, which will get you through that wait period, then the bigger dose after the coffee has worn down.

Of course we are all individuals with unique biology, but it seems to me that this would apply to most people to different degrees.",3,1738600599.0,VyvanseADHD,2,1.0,False

I started reading the book “easy way....” and although i am on chapter 4 it forced me to think that actually smoking is not a HABIT its an DRUG ADDICTION.

Coz starting of this year i have formed and broken may habits
1. Stopped using sugar in my tea/coffee (broken a habit)
2. Started waking up early, shower and pray before i start my day(formed a new habit)
3. Stopped eating junk food 

And this was not sooooo difficult as quitting smoking.I am sure you must have also formed or broken a habit in past month.


It would be interesting to know how different my perspective would be once I complete reading this book.

This isn’t to say she’s violent or abusive as she really isn’t but she’s disgustingly filthy, to the point I would have to tell her to clean herself and her surroundings, to brush her teeth and wash her clothes, she knows what she’s doing and not doing as well. She acts ignorant to everything, even her friends would tell her this but she just would not care. Whenever she fell out with someone the first thing they’d do is comment on her hygiene. 

This may be long so I apologise in advance. 

The way she lives started when we were kids, we were poor, we didn’t have money, we had nothing. Living off of benefits and wherever my mum could borrow money from, always living in filth and I don’t just mean a few dirty dishes, I mean actual filth, rotten food in the kitchen, mould growing over dirty dishes, maggots and rubbish on top of rubbish, dirty washing, unusable sinks because they’re blocked with filth, it’s how we’ve always lived. 

Now I love my mum don’t get me wrong and she wasn’t an abusive parent she does love us so I feel awful for saying this because we had a childhood but we didn’t? We had a house to live in but there was never any warm meals or food in the cupboards. She didn’t work (I mean she didn’t for as long as I can remember, her first job that I actually recognise her getting was when I was 13. She now has a full time job but there’s always a reason she’s off on sick or personal leave some reason or the other) and wasn’t willing to go through schooling to get a decent job and give us a good life and that’s not to say we didn’t have a good life because again she wasn’t abusive but she was neglectful? I guess, I really don’t know what to say here as I love my mum. 

Now the way we lived has happened in every house we’ve been in, to the point that when we moved into our third house the last landlord my mum had phoned the police on her as she was concerned about us (there are three of us) because there was a shed that was piled high with waste, there was nothing but bin bags on top of bin bags in there and it was the same with the kitchen. When they arrived we lied about how lived (we always did as it was normal) so nothing happened further with that. I remember us being under social services for years. There was a time where we had to live with my nana while she tidied the house as we weren’t allowed in until it was. So you can see where my sister gets it from and she now lives this way constantly as it’s normal for her and she knows it’s not but she won’t change. 

I however am now the cleanest neat freak around, I can not stand to live in filth, it makes me feel like I’m losing my mind. I feel so disgusting and vile that it genuinely gets me to a point where I’m so depressed I’m ill. I had to grow up that way, I was excited when I knew the socials would be coming as that meant I’d be able to have a clean house and my mum could now cook in the kitchen instead of ordering takeout, I don’t want to live that way as an adult. So I don’t understand how she would want to live the way we were forced to as children, why she would want to put her child through that.

So fast forward years later, we all still live together I’m 20 my sisters are 19 and 11, I want to move out but I know I can’t afford it so I’m stuck here. I’ll give it to my mum, she nowhere near as bad as she used to be but u still have to tell her to clean her room or to move her rubbish, I’ll tell her that the kitchen needs doing as her and my two sister would completely mess it up but she is a lot better and will actually do it now. So it’ll get cleaned but fall back in to the state it was in and it’ll get cleaned again, a toxic cycle. 

The 11 year old is also very unhygienic, I try everything to get her to be clean but she’s been brought up the same way we were at a lesser degree to what she can remember but my mum has done everything for her, went to classes to get some qualifications and a proper job for her, thrown her parties with whatever she wishes, days out and expensive things, hot meals, clothes whenever she needs, new shoes that aren’t second hand, everything. I can get jealous yes as why wouldn’t she do this for the other two children? Why didn’t we get that but I’m beyond glad the youngest gets what she does as I truly love my family but I don’t like them a lot of the time. 

Now I know what some people will be thinking ‘Why not just clean yourself?’ I do! I did! Every day, all the time, whenever I could! But it would just turn out the same way so I stopped. I thought ‘They’re grown enough to realise what they’re doing now.’ and they aren’t. They just work around it, so I stay in my room, blocked off from everyone, I live from out of my room. I make sure the bathroom is clean as I still use that but I leave the rest of the house alone. My room is always done, it’s my comfort zone so I stay in there constantly unless I’m at work. 

Anyway, now you know about that. My sister has recently had a baby, December 2024. But her room is vile. She didn’t even care to clean it when she found out she was pregnant, me and my friend had to clean it because it was disgusting all throughout her pregnancy and when he was born (luckily but also extremely unluckily) he was a premature baby so he couldn’t come home yet so as scary as that was I had time to get the house in shape for him as no one else did. 

My sister isn’t depressed or having post partum, I do acknowledge its risks though, it is a scary thing to live through. I say this as she was fine planning a baby shower and a gender reveal, fun picking out names and what she would prefer, the room she’d like for them etc etc… it was as if she planned getting pregnant. 

So when me and my friend cleaned everything for her (we gutted her room out it took us hours!) we offered future help and I warned her when I showed her her finished room if it ever got that bad again (the amount of deep cleans her room has needed is unbelievable, I can’t even count the amount of times she needed to sort the mess out) I will be calling the socials as I wouldn’t want that baby to be forced into the life we were. I offered help, I do not mind helping I don’t know personally but I understand that having a newborn can be extremely taxing to anyone. So I didn’t mind. All I got in response to this message was ‘Is there any room next to my bed?xx’ 

(As I’m writing this I’ve just heard my mum say there’s a dirty nappy on the coffee table…) 

At this point I was totally done with everyone in the house. I’ve always been not unemotional but numb so I come off as uncaring, I understand emotions obviously but I just don’t feel them to the extent other people do. I’m more think logically not with feelings. 

I started becoming so blunt with everything I was saying and honestly it sounds nasty but there is no other way to get into her head that she needs to be clean! She listens to not her way as she couldn’t care less. 

It kept happening again and again and again, she’s had to clean her room around 4 or 5 times since having her baby in December. 3-4 bin bags full of rubbish and dirty clothes coming out each time. 

I rang the socials when I realised the baby was ill (he had a cold) but being a premature baby and having to come back and sleep in that room was ridiculous. I couldn’t take it anymore and I am genuinely worried for his health so I messaged an old service worker who used to do visits with us as kids and she said she’d do a professional referral (that tells me a referral was needed and I’m doing the right thing).

When they found out it was me who pre warned them I got nothing from them, they acted normally around me, my sister being more quiet now. Until I saw messages on my mums phone between her and my sister having a conversation about me, it went like this:

Mum: I can’t believe ~me~ reported you x

Sister: I don’t even want to be in the same house as her anymore, it’s not fair on anyone in the house when she’s b!*chy like that x

Mum: No it’s not and to put the baby at risk as well x

Sister: I know I just said to ~her boyfriend~ then, the baby could have gotten taken away and she’s not even bothered, her saying he’s ill because of my room is bullsh!t, it’s a cold x

Mum: I know x
Mum: Wait till she’s gone work and we can talk properly then x

Sister: I’m fine now, like I said they can come out and look I’ve got nothing to hide, she’s just made it out like I can’t look after my child x

Mum: Yep she’s silly because when they come they will see I’m decorating my room and that’s why everything is upside down, if it was serious Keira health visitor and neonatal nurse and midwife would of said something x

Sister: I know like I said there’s nothing wrong they can come out all they want x

Mum: Yep x

Sister: they’ve still not rang me yet xx

Mum: it’s not serious that’s why and they may just turn up whenever they feel like it x 

Sister: I know x

And that was that, after I read them I didn’t want to do anything but get out of the house, I had a shift at 7pm that night but my manager rang me and said that I wasn’t needed in as she had some things she needs to do and it’s not busy enough for two members of staff, so I don’t know what angel is up there but I didn’t have to go in. When my mum asked why I’m not going to work and why I’m instead going out with my friend I told her what happened. She then went and messaged my sister again and they had another conversation about me acting as if I’m always calling in sick and never turning up to work my my mum calling me silly again, saying I’m losing out on money (as if she hasn’t been sat at home doing nothing for months hectare was in sick from work), as if it’s normal for me to do. 

I can not deal with them anymore. Now I’m not going to pretend I’m the nicest person out there, I’m not and I’ve already mentioned my issues with emotions and how I’m perceived as by other people but for her to say I’m acting like I’m not bothered and then go on a tangent about how I’m b!*chy just really f*cked me off. 

I’ve always had these issues and I’ve always dealt with anger issues, I have really calmed down from when I was 12-17, I was constant fighting and arguments with people who would be willing to fight, including my mum, we’d come to physical blows, she acts as if it was a joke and I was “a troubled child” I was in a way and I know why personally and yes it does have to do with the way I grew up. 

I was embarrassed, I saw all these people with as much as I had yet they were happy? They were clean. They had friends who were actual friends and parents/guardians who cared about all of that so I took it out on them, I’m not stupid if I could go back and apologise to every single person I was nasty to I would, it’s an excuse not a reason. I feel guilty about it every day I was in no position to judge anyone, yet I did. 

But for my sister and mum to agree that I was being unemotional about the whole situation was a different type of sting. I did what I did because I’m worried because for once I’m actually acting on these feeling and not my head. It hurt. 

The health visitor did her check if my sisters room, nowhere else but my sister knew she was coming and she cleaned beforehand, well actually her boyfriend did, he always does, he’s the one that cleans this house I walked downstairs and saw him doing washing and tidying the living room, a mess my mum made, but the health visitor checked nowhere else. 

Now I have videos and pictures of how this house can get, I have everything to prove what I’m stating, so I was ready to show her as she said she wanted to talk to me but she left after checking the baby’s weight? 

I now look like an inconsiderate tw@t who just wanted to cause issues I honestly can’t see this going any further with the social services but I don’t know what to do now as the baby can’t live like this? He really can’t. 

So any advice I will take. Thank you!

Nice little old school diner where I can get Catfish and Eggs for Breakfast and ... when they have it....delcious GALAKTOBOUREKO!

WHAT I ATE - VIRGINIA  
@ City Diner  
Falls Church, VA  
  
One of the few places in the area where we can get Fried Catfish for breakfast is at the City Diner in Falls Church, VA.  
  
Their extensive menu has pages of diner staples, but today, both my wife and I were craving the catfish and eggs platter which also came with grits (or home fries). We always look in their cake display to see if they have galaktoboureko that day. They don't always make it, but when they do.....we are on it!  
  
A good cup of coffee started the meal right! My wife liked the strong brew. I just sank into the perfectly warm cup.  
  
I was looking for something different, so I also ordered some Strawberry Blintzes to go with my Catfish breakfast.  
  
The waitstaff were quick with the coffee refills and the food also came out in short order.  
  
The catfish fillets were nicely breaded and fried crisp. Grits were cooked well to a creamy texture. Eggs were made perfectly to order as well, with a rich oozy yolk for dipping the corners of my toast.  
  
The blintzes were good, and served with sour cream, fresh strawberries and a strawberry compote. I mistook the sour cream for whipped cream and it took a few tastes before I realized it was sour cream. This was a good meal for doing some heavy weekend work.  
  
We love the City Diner, but wish it went back to the pre-covid hours where we could come for a late-night meal. Now, you have to get there before 7PM on most days.

We met through my mom actually because she really liked him and thought we'd be a good match.  As a person he's a bit guarded,  regimented and organized but persistent. I slowly felt like he was opening up to me. On our third date he tried to kiss me.  I wasnt ready yet as i haven't dated for 5 years because i went back to school and was taking care of my mom after being diagnosed with cancer so physical intimacy is a little foreign right now.  I also need to feel emotionally connected before i move on to physical connection and just wanted to get to know him better.  He attempted a few times and I gave him my cheek, but it wasn't an outright rejection. I hugged him before he left and told him i like seeing him. 

He messaged me the next day and things seemed fine.  I wanted to explain why i didn't kiss him back but didn't find good timing to do so and couldn't think of a way to bring it up because i didn't want to upset him.  He seemingly wasn't too phased by it though,  as he dropped off a coffee at work for me (gave it to a staff member to bring it back bc civilians aren't allowed to go into where i work) and told me his mom made me a gift. We spoke consistently throughout the week and it made me feel happy and made me feel closer to him. I was excited to see him and felt like i was more comfortable with being physically close (i wanted to hug him and touch him,  things like that). I was also wanting to talk about what happened that night. 

I saw him yesterday and it didn't go as planned.  He was colder towards me and any closeness we've developed seemed to be out the window.  It took a while for me to break down his guard and it also made me feel anxious and guarded. We went for a hike after brunch and it was icy on the trail but he was walking ahead of me,  not really checking back on me,  was moving tree branches out of his face and ended up flinging them into mine (a few hit me in the face and i got a cut on my lip). He'd move picker bush branches out of his way and not warn me about them and they would also fling back towards me with one cutting my leg.   I'm not sure if he realized he was doing this but he didn't seem concerned about how i was doing. Towards the end i started slipping and he did let me hold on to his arm but was simultaneously pulling away from me. 

As we're walking back to our cars he was asking me about my work schedule,  then as we're leaving said we should plan for something during the week.  He didn't initiate a hug goodbye or anything so i hugged him and i left.  

I felt upset about it when i got home. He's either acting this way because i didn't kiss him back or maybe he started talking to someone new.  My friends think i should see him one more time but i feel poorly about our last interaction and i don't think that me not kissing him justifies him acting that way on the hike.  I'm always looking out for people and i know that even if he made me upset I'd still hold branches back and warn him about things that could hurt him.  


Was hoping to get outside perspective and if i should let this go or give it another chance. I do feel vulnerable now and this was a big step back for me that I'm not sure if me not kissing him is even worth explaining anymore. I also wonder if him doing sweet things for me then being cold when we saw eachother was intentional, but there's also the possibility that he didn't realize he was doing these things at brunch or on the hike.

You know, the incredibly bad quality ones from CCTV cameras or home videos. I remember one YT channel in particular called **Saint Birgitta (Saint Birgitte?)** which hosted tons of these videos. They usually featured asian people in mundane setting, like elevators, walking through underpasses or walking through buildings. After the initial clip ended, it started again and focused on the ""ghost"" sighting, usually also blown larger or encircled to point it out. Now I know that they were super fake, but for the nostalgia factor, I'd love to find this channel or videos and rewatch them with friends. I can't find the channel anymore and I don't remember their full name or the URL. Please, can you help me?

  
Videos I remember:

\- 1st person POV, someone walking through a busy tunnel/underpass with other people. The ghost was hidden in front of one of the pillars? rock columns? and was extending it's hand towards the cameraman while they were walking around it.

  
\- CCTV from an elevator where the ghost was visible through the window on the elevator doors. People inside weren't reacting to it.

  
\- The weirdest one - scene from someone's living room, family enjoying tea/coffee time. One of the guests looks weird and you notice that they have huge black holes instead of eyes and are looking directly into the camera which other guests are ignoring. The ghost sets their cup on table? floor?, turns to the side and you can see that they have weird shape of head (kinda like the xenomorph from Alien, but shorter and maybe even curled, like a snail shell?)",3,1738600277.0,InternetMysteries,2,0.81,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Posters and word of mouth have always been pretty good, but are a slow build. Social media and email marketing can reach a wider audience but with so much content out there, it’s easy to get lost in the noise. Television, print and radio all have their benefits, but it can go either way. Sometimes a ton of people happen to see an article or a morning news segment, and sometimes very few do. We’re all different so I recognize there is no one single way, so I’m curious what each of you tend to use to decide what you’re going to do on a night out? What are you looking for in a night out and how would you like to see it advertised? 

I’m asking because I’m one of the folks who run a comedy club in NKY called Commonwealth Sanctuary. We’re a 100 seat club in a former church building. It’s a quirky place for sure, and we’ve got plans to make some significant upgrades to the inside over time, but currently it still has a ton of charm plus we’re bringing in some incredible comedians like Rory Scovel, Michael Ian Black, River Butcher, Todd Barry, Doug Benson, David Gborie, and more. 

Starting a business and getting the word out is hard. We’re friends with most of the business owners in our little town of Dayton, Kentucky. We see how much effort is put in by the restaurants, coffee shops, bars, stores, etc. and I believe in this little city just a few miles away from downtown Cincinnati.

After a few weeks of that I started noticing frequent highs. So I recently backed down to 1:10.

1igsvdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1igsvdf/i_got_tested_for_hiv/,I Got Tested for HIV,"
I got an HIV test yesterday. It’s been a while since I’ve been sexually active, but I just wanted to make sure. The test was free, so I thought, ""Why not, right?""

When I got to the clinic, I was surprised kasi ang cozy ng lugar. Hindi siya yung intimidating na clinic na usually kong naiisip. Chill lang, friendly pa ang mga staff so that helped ease my nerves a bit. They even had free coffee which I grabbed, pero kahit may kape, hindi pa rin mawala-wala yung kaba ko!

When it was my turn, the staff interviewed me about my sexual history and other health stuff. He was professional and didn’t judge at all, so I felt more comfortable. Then, he did a finger prick, just one little poke for a drop of blood. After that, it was just the waiting game for about 10 to 15 minutes.

While waiting, I made another coffee, but honestly, I couldn’t shake off the nerves! Ang dami ko ng ""What if's"" sa utak ko!

""What if positive ako?""
""What will I tell my family?""
""Will my friends look at me differently?""
I tried to stay calm, but it was so hard.


Then finally, the staff called me. I said, ""Please, be gentle, baka atakihin ako!"" Hahaha. And then he said, ""Ma’am, non-reactive po ang result niyo. Congrats!"" Grabe, I felt like a huge weight was lifted off my chest.

I’m sharing this kasi gusto ko lang ipaalala na getting tested for HIV isn’t something to be ashamed of. In fact, it’s a responsible thing to do for yourself and the people around you. Even if you’re not sexually active right now, it’s still important to know your status.

If the result is negative, you’ll know how to stay on top of things and prevent it in the future. You’ll be more aware, more informed, and you’ll take better care of yourself. And if it’s positive, early detection means early treatment, and with proper care, you can still live a long, healthy life.

It’s fast, free, and confidential. Wala kang dapat ikahiya. Whether your result is negative or positive, what matters is you took the step to care for your health.

So if you’re reading this, maybe this is your sign to get tested too. If you’re nervous, bring a friend. And remember, getting tested doesn’t define you, it shows that you care. 😊

Once in a while someone gets excited because they managed to do tensegrity, inside a dream.

I don't recommend it unless you followed instructions and looked at your hands, then at an object in the dream, then back to your hands, and repeat.

To prove you brought some tonal rationality into the dream, which is pretty much the main purpose of using sleeping dreams.

Just because you had a dream from being obsessed over Tensegrity,doesn't make it meaningful.

And very bad men plaguing our community since the 1990s made up all sorts of horrible things, such as ""Don Juan came into my dream and taught me Yoga Tensegrity, and said that Carlos went bad.""

(donate button is on the side).

How about instead of doing tensegrity in an obsessive nightmare, you just learn to turn your dark room into a dream?

It's called ""dreaming awake"", and the practice of doing tensegrity in darkness while forcing off your internal dialogue, inevitably leads to it.

But you have to work hard daily, and NEVER forget that removing every single word from your mind, is mandatory if you want real results.

Again, if you forget that the magic only comes from the silence, you'll stall out.

Carlos emphasized this in private classes, even teaching us to use sticks and poles and coffee tables and  crystals, to do concentrated sessions while sitting down.

And he created the ""long forms"" because he saw that we weren't able to be silent doing individual movements. He thought that having to remember them would help.

But it didn't, and not a single person learned any sorcery at all while he was alive. 

I suppose some got ""weird sensations"", but look at that lower right picture. It's done fully awake, eyes wide open, and completely sober.  And there's really no excuse for not being able to do that, after supposedly practicing for decades.

It just goes to show that if you don't actually follow instructions, sorcery doesn't work.

It's not a religion!

And if that picture of Tensegrity done in a dream looks impossible, consider that Taisha's entire last book, the one that was only given out as copy store bound versions (Cholita got one), took place entirely in a phantom copy of Zuleica's home.

Of course it's much cooler to do that ""phantom copy so real you can't tell"".

Seeing as how beginning ""dreaming awake"" rooms are rather abstract and chaotic.  You'll get obsessed with trying to get things to take form, until you realize that uses up dreaming energy more quickly.

But you aren't focused on the room itself anyway!
