I’m so glad I quit ,I still crave it and want it but so far I’m not giving up . It was so hard the first few days . You know I have been smoking all my life . I’m almost 50 . I quit couple of times before . Quitting cigarettes is hard but for me it’s so much easier than Vaping . Vaping is just so addictive. The idea of vaping all the time , when I wake up with coffee , in the car , when I’m drinking , in the bathroom anywhere you can vape .im so glad I quit smoking. I don’t think I will ever vape again . If you vape , you can quit . I never thought I could but I did it . Good luck everyone ",2,1735186242.0,QuitVaping,0,1.0,False
1hmgi6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1hmgi6s/is_it_possible_to_be_a_sober_ally/,Is it possible to be a sober ally?,"After a Christmas Eve hang with an acquaintance that went horribly wrong (I'm still emotionally drained), I finally realized that I just don't feel comfortable around very drunk people. I've never been an alcoholic, though my mother is and I'm sure I'm a tad traumatized by that. I can count the number of times I've been drunk in my life on one hand, and I tend to just nurse the same beer all night at parties unless I'm very familiar with the people I'm around. I've always said that I prefer quieter events, but dealing with a fall-down drunk last night kind of confirmed it: I hate drinking. I hate being in bars, and I hate dealing with people who have more than a few drinks.

No judgement. You can do whatever you'd like, I'd just rather see you another time.

Is it okay for non-alcoholics to attend sober events? Not AA meetings obviously, but sometimes there are fun outings like picnics or game nights for sober people, and I think it would be so fun to hang out with people without having the *expectation* that drinking is involved. I'd just as soon have a soda or coffee, frankly.

If you're a recovering alcoholic, would this be okay with you? I don't want to intrude on such a space if it's uncomfortable for y'all to have people who haven't been through it there. Thanks in advance! ",0,1735186208.0,NoStupidQuestions,0,0.5,False

One day I was talking to each other during coffee hour, and I was wearing St. Benedictus crucifix, which is widely used in Latin church. A very respected person (a close relative of the clergies) came to tell me they don't wear cross with our Lord on it, because Christ had already resurrected, so they only wore simple crosses. This makes me very worried, as it sounds like the most usual Protestant's criticism to Latin church that we crucify him on the cross everyday in divine liturgy, as we believe it is a sacrifice, the same sacrifice as in Golgotha but without blood. Protestants usually argue that Christ has already risen so he should be removed from the cross. I believe that the Orthodox Church should not hold this view, as it still believes that the divine liturgy is a sacrifice. My question is what is the position regarding using crucifix of the Orthodox Church. Did the person who talked to me misunderstand the doctrines? I do see the cross that bishops and priests in Orthodox Church wear have our Lord on it (in Latin church, the pectoral cross usually does not have our Lord on it, but it contains relics).",1,1735185377.0,OrthodoxChristianity,4,1.0,False

Our priorities:

1. Proximity to ""stuff"" - no more than 30 mins to downtown Raleigh, Durham, or Chapel Hill, and ideally with a nice small town, restaurants, coffee shops, grocers, and parks etc in under 10 minutes. Ruralish feel is ok as long as it is convenient to daily amenities (like a major grocery store).

2. Decent sized plots of land with greenery and houses widely spaced from one another (ie none of those developments with houses in jam packed rows)

3. House sizes of 3750+ SQ feet with higher end finishes - ideally in developments where builders will work with you to customize a new build. 

4. We're coming from Austin and we appreciate local businesses and an open mind. We don't frequent chain restaurants and prefer a funky/artsy vibe (ie downtown Asheville lol). 

Based on the above two areas that seem like a potential fit are Wake Forest and Pittsboro (the Ryan's Crossing Development is close to what we want), but I'm very curious to hear thoughts from this sub!

There are multiple ""floors"" (apartment levels), hidden passages (like the window Ross climbs through), and dynamic factions constantly clashing—Roommate Wars, Ross vs. Everyone, and the eternal Monica vs. Chandler Cleaning Rivalry.  

The ""dungeon"" spans several locations—two apartments, a coffee shop, and occasionally the hallway or a beach house—but it's enough to keep millions engaged for 10 seasons.  

Honestly, it made me question if I’ve been over-complicating dungeon design. Maybe all I need is some snarky dialogue, secret turkey sandwiches, and a pivot strategy.

1hmfvyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverthinking/comments/1hmfvyl/friend_or_situationship/,Friend or Situationship?,"Hi, this is my first time posting here, but would like some advice on if I'm just overthinking.

I (26 yo F) have a friend/coworker (32 yo M) and we have known each other for about 5 years. We both met at work. For context, my company is completely remote and we both live in different states. When I got  hired on he helped trained me but it was mainly over Zoom, but eventually he moved up in management in the company so now we don't work in the same department. In the beginning it was mainly professional and we only messaged each other for work related things. However, over the last 3-3.5 years we both have gotten to known each pretty well and we text about lots of random things and we also get along with each other pretty well whenever we have met in person (probably about 10-15 times).

Earlier this year, I went to visit him and stayed at his place for about a month since he invited knowing that I don't like the winter and he lives in a warmer place and I didn't have any reason to say no (I have previously stayed at his place before, but usually it was 1-2 days with another of our coworkers/friend). During the time I was there it felt a bit like we were dating (?) or just really good friends. He would make my coffee in the morning, cook meals, watch movies, and he even planned places to take me to on our day off. I have met some of his friends and later found out from him that his friends thought we were dating. The last week I was there, we did have the conversation (he brought it up, but it was also after an incident that made him mad and we had talked about that too) about how we felt about each other, because a lot of his friends were asking questions and he didn't want me to misunderstand. To put is simply, I told him I just think of him as a really good friend/coworker and he told me the same thing.

Things got a bit awkward between us the day before I got home, so we didn't talk/text the week I got back and I had an international trip with my family a week after I got back so we didn't message while I was gone. After I got back from my family trip, we started texting again, but it wasn't the same as before (i.e just sending random memes). He would ask me how my day was, update me about his day (i.e when he goes to gym, go grocery shopping, hanging out with his friends, opinions on personal matter) etc. So for awhile it felt like I had a bf, even though I didn't and he at some point had asked where I am in dating, whether I would consider moving, etc. I also get mix signals because other times I don't hear from him for 7-10 days. This has been going on for a while now and I don't know what to think of my situation. The people around me says that we both should just start dating each other. Am I just overthinking that he might like me?",2,1735183930.0,AmIOverthinking,1,1.0,False

I had been on YouTube for 9 years before this and never saw much success. But the past few months, somethings have changed. I started getting a little more money. And went on to earn more than one of my parents. Christmas was coming around this year and it's no secret that he like Jesus, since he works in a church and has spent his whole life worshiping God. So this year I bought him a miniature statue that reads ""Jesus is always watching"". I thought it was a cool gift to show that I pay attention to the fact that he likes religion. And my other parent is not secretive about liking money and more flashy things. So I got them a long rug that looks like a 100 dollar bill. I also included. 2 gift cards for them each to go to their favorite restaurants. Each card had 50 dollars on it...I sent them an additional 100 dollars so that they could buy something nice for themselves too. In addition I bought my younger siblings a gift that I'm sure they would like. In total I spent around 700 dollars I couldnt make it back home for Christmas unfortunately because I was sick and the previous day I had been suffering from a sinus infection. Ya know fever and nosebleeds. So I wrote their names on the gifts and called my little sister to have her store them in the basement. Come the day of Christmas I called them to say merry Christmas. Expecting much joy and appreciation or even just a hello. But I was instead met with my father saying he didn't like the gifts and I could have done better. He ended up yelling at the top of his lungs at my younger brother and it sounded like he was going to get physical. Before I could ask any questions he hung up. I then ran to my car and drove 40 minutes to see what was wrong. And help if I could. My dad has a history of being violent and making some serious threats when he feels angry enough. No matter how small the situation is. If it's a big deal to him, then he will make it a big deal to you. When I arrived at the house my younger brother was crying on the couch while my mom was holding him. My mother isn't any better of a person than my dad. I would argue that she is manipulative and worse actually. So seeing my brother in her clutches didn't give me a sense of ease. My dad was in his office so I had to walk past my mother to get to him. She notices me there. She widens her eyes and yells at me. Saying ""What kinds of gifts are these!?"".. I was confused as I thought I was doing something nice and I don't usually want to hurt anyone but the house seemed to be in complete shambles as if they had witnessed a crime happen. I walk into my father's office. And I see him push out a chair for me to sit down in. I'm already uncomfortable at this point because I was pretty sure I tried my best with the gifts and gave them extra money just incase they wanted something else. So I wasn't sure why the theatrics were necessary. I sit down and ask him what's going on. He replies: theses gifts didn't seem to come from the heart. And it's like you don't know is at all. He was upset that his gift was money themed. And he thought I could have done better is she short of it. I'm out of my parents house so I didn't see a need to hold back my own feelings. I told him I tried my best and I didn't understand why he and ma were acting so rude, ungrateful, and sensitive. Me saying that opened up the flood gates. He started yelling louder claiming that I didn't try. And since I make more money than my mom and almost as much money as him that I should have tried harder. It didn't take a genius to know that he was implying that I spent more on them. Which was odd because. There were plenty Christmases where I got almost nothing and the gifts I did get made it clear that they didn't know me all that well. But being the oldest child I never complained. As long as my brother's were happy then I didn't see a problem with it. So it was very dissapointing to see two grown adults acting entitled to my money while I'm trying my best to live in my own place and work to stay afloat in this economy. He then says that I also always undermine him and act like a 3rd patent to make him look bad in front of my siblings. Little backstory... I'm adopted. I was adopted at the age of 15 and they always made it seem like I was a dog in the streets that no one wanted. And that they were the god sent angels that saved me. Because of this, they've always been extremely entitled about my time, energy, money, and silence. So in the middle of him yelling at me he brings up my birth mom and starts insulting her. I asked him politely to stop because it's a sensitive topic for me. And he continues to bash her. I ask him 2 more times to stop. and he refuses. I stood up in my chair and asked him what he wanted from me and asked if the whole point was that he wanted me to cry. He does this a lot. He likes to yell at you and make you cry. Then my mom usually enters the room to make it seem like she's the kind lover of the family. It's a sick good cop bad cop game they love to play. My father veered of topic and started yelling about the fact that I'm outspoken when I see them hit my siblings. Or when I hear the say something like calling the. Retarded or an aspole. I had enough. I asked him why he has a problem with my willingness to fallout the behavior but not the behavior itself. I didn't understand why he was angry about me not wanting to have my siblings be raised in negative and damaging words. He scoffs and laughs at me. He states how no matter how wrong he is. That it is never my business to defend or protect my loved ones from him or from anyone else. Which as an older sibling gets under my skin because of how insane it sounds. But I stay calm and ask him a hypothetical. I say if "" I see my younger brother walking towards fire, you're saying I shouldn't tell him to walk in the other direction? He doubles down and this time he starts swearing at me telling me "" it would be none of my business. So I just outright tell him. You are being Insane. He then tells me that I was being disrespectful and gets even closer to my face. I can fell his spit and the heat of his coffee stained breath. So I move away and ask him another question. Are you saying you can disrespect me and my effort and I can't disrespect you? He then yells at me . ""Saying you're trying to get even and that's not right"". Sensing that I couldn't have a logical conversation with him I stand up and walk away. Another second in that room with him and I'm sure I would have pulled the scissors out of my pocket and stabbed him in the throat. I figured if I gave it a while he would realize that he didn't make any sense and he would be grateful for the gifts and money I gave him for Christmas. Keep in mind I didn't see a single gift and I wasn't complaining. But what he did next was much worse.",15,1735183783.0,raisedbynarcissists,5,0.95,False

Today is Christmas and we were washing dishes and I told him hey don’t put the coffee grounds in the sink I threw away the catcher! (It was really gross). He said why? And I said it was really gross and needed to be replaced he said no you just wash it bc the rim is stainless steel. But I said it looked like the silicon portion had mold on it. He said you just wash it and that it was really stupid to throw it away and that it was $30. This upset me so I took a second to sit on the couch before I told him that I’m sorry I that I threw it away and that I planned to buy the next one and that I didn’t know it was that expensive and that I’d ask if I could throw things away that he buys.

 I can’t imagine it being that expensive so out of curiosity I checked our Amazon that showed it was a third of that price which I noted to him because it seemed like a way to make me feel guilty to exaggerate the price and that he hurt my feelings to call me stupid. He said he didn’t and I clarified that he said it was a stupid action of mine to throw away that item. He noted that I’m upset because he is no longer able to attend a double date I planned a while ago. I was sad but that’s not what this conversation was about at all and I understand he is busy so I really don’t mind, plans fall through its not like we can never go out again. What I did want was an apology for hurting my feelings so I said that I’d like that from him as I was feeling bad and he said no that he did not care and I should not have thrown it away and that he was the one that was upset. I said just bc u were upset initially does not mean you are right or that you did not hurt my feelings. He often gets upset that I drag the conversation on and that I am taking up too much time. All that I’m hearing is what he’s saying and it just hits me like a truck word for word that he does not care how I feel and inferred by the last part is that resolving issues and explaining my feelings is not worth his time. He left to the gas station and came back in a few minutes, I called bc I had no idea where he went as he left mid conversation noting that I create my own problems. 

He’s now back and talking to me like I wasn’t almost in tears as he left and like everything is fine. I’m beyond confused and I’m just scared that if he doesn’t care about these simple hurts that he won’t care about hurting me in any other way. We moved and I now live states away from my family, I didn’t go home for Xmas bc he works and I am committed to creating a life here which means to me that I create and celebrate here with my partner.

She is very attractive and we met for coffee. We get along well, she says I make her ""safe"" and listened to and we emotionally and mentally connect. We decide that due to age differences (she doesn't want kids nor marriage), we can't really commit to anything more than friends. So we decide to be friends.

The next time she comes to my place and we are talking on the couch. She is doing lots of touching (she is VERY touchy as its her ""primary love language"") and we started cuddling. We end up hooking up. We both realized we didn't really want to....afterwards.

Honestly, I felt seduced.... and the escalation (her touchy touchy, putting her foot on my body, and accidently brushing me down there, and heavy petting in my crotch area) was made me be weak in the moment.

To be honest, she did stop and talk when things escalated (while we were hooking up), and I told her we can discuss it afterwards. She pulled me closer And we continued.

Afterwards, we had a talk and both acknowledged we got carried away. She claims, ""I thought that maybe you had made the decision to be more than friends"". I never did that, even when we had the discussion. So, we both acknowledge that we got carried away in the moment and we promised to continue only being **friends** and not let things get out of hand.

We hung out again. This time I came to her place. We spoke for hours. and we spoke about deep things again, emotional and psychological stuff. No sex happened. and we kept a ""safe"" distance on the couch. Though we were very close.

This time she was wearing a green loose gown. I could see her bra...easily. And honestly, that bra might have been the only thing she was wearing underneath the grown. The grown had long slits on the sides of either leg. So, on the couch, she was very comfortable and she would sit cross legged facing me, and stretch her legs out and cross her legs, revealing much of her thighs..... She was touchy but just to pet my hand or hold my hand.

We are going to continue our friendship. Lol, no sex. She made a long speech stating this.

What is the best way to proceed with this new friend, given that we connect well, she is very attractive and honestly... I think I will get weak again.. but also consider that she doesn't want marriage or kids.. and I want that. 

 TL;DR  
I am 33 She slightly older than 40. We decided to only be friends (she doesn't want more kids or marriage). She comes to my place, She is very touchy it turns me on. One thing leads to another we hook up. We agreed we got carried away decided to continue being friends. She invites me to her place, we keep talking and shes slightly touchy but very seductively dressed. Can't figure out what she really wants as she doesn't want to get married or have kids, so I can't date her. We both agreed to be friends.",0,1735183579.0,relationships,4,0.14,False
1hmfruu,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngelesTrips/comments/1hmfruu/can_i_bring_food_into_the_aquarium_of_the_pacific/,Can I bring food into the Aquarium of the Pacific?,"Hey there fellow ocean enthusiasts! 

I recently visited the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, and I noticed a lot of people asking about their food policy. So, I thought I'd share my experience and clear things up for anyone planning to visit.

The short answer is: No, you can't bring outside food or drinks into the Aquarium of the Pacific. However, don't let this discourage you! There are some exceptions and plenty of great dining options available.

Here's what you need to know:

Exceptions to the Food Policy:
- Baby food and formula are allowed
- Medical necessity items (like snacks for diabetics)
- Water bottles (must be sealed when you enter)

I spent about 3 hours exploring the aquarium last week, and honestly, the food options inside are pretty solid. The Café Scuba offers everything from sandwiches and salads to kid-friendly meals. There's also the Blue Whale Café if you're just looking for a quick snack or coffee.

Pro tip: If you're trying to save money, you can get your hand stamped and have lunch at one of the many restaurants at Rainbow Harbor, right outside the aquarium. Then just head back in to continue your adventure!

Speaking of adventures, let me tell you about the incredible exhibits I saw. From playful sea otters to mesmerizing jellyfish, this place is packed with amazing marine life. I booked my tickets through this link: https://athometouch.com/Aquarium and got to skip the lines (totally worth it, especially on weekends).

Some quick money-saving tips:
- Pack snacks in your car for before/after
- Bring a refillable water bottle
- Look for combo deals if you're planning to eat at Café Scuba
- Visit during off-peak hours (weekday mornings are best)

Parking tip: The aquarium parking structure charges $8 with validation (much cheaper than nearby options).

The new food policy might seem strict, but after experiencing the cleanliness of the exhibits and understanding how it helps protect the marine life, it makes total sense. Plus, the dining options inside are reasonably priced compared to other attractions in LA.

I've visited several aquariums across the country, and the Aquarium of the Pacific really stands out. The exhibits are fantastic (don't miss the sea otters!), and the staff is super knowledgeable. If you're planning to visit, I'd really recommend booking ahead through the link I mentioned above - it saved me a lot of time and hassle.

Just remember, while you can't bring in a picnic lunch, you're in for an amazing experience that's well worth planning around meal times. The focus here is really on the incredible marine life and conservation efforts, which is what makes this place so special.

I have a long term partner, we have a running company together, we own a house, we have assets together, and a seemingly nice life.

What people don't see is how exhausted and lonely I am. I miss having friends to go out with, having girls nights, or just going for a coffee. I used to have a very social life, but after a few years of entrepreneurship, living in a coty far away from my friends and family, and also constantly being at work, I lost my social life. I could still hit my old friends up to go out, but most of the time I'm so darn exhausted that I can barely walk myself to bed. I feel like I'm suffocating in all the work I have to do, I'm basically 24/7/365 tied to my work and to my company. And of course it's hard to explain to someone who's not having their own company, that I can't just leave the work undone. If I would, that would mean loss of income for me as well. The field that me and my partner have the company in is very hectic and really demands your constant attention and ability to react to constantly changing situations. I know that I have chosen this, but working constantly with little no none time to wind it down and just rest, it's hard to maintain all the other aspects of my life. 

My family is also super proud of me, I'm one of the few of our family that have ""made something of themselves"". It feels nice that they're proud, but at the same time it creates huge pressure for me. I have the feeling that if I fail, I'll let my family down. That they'd be so disappointed in me that they'd think badly of me. It might not be the case, but I still feel the pressure to succeed as they wish for me. Even if I'm not very sure that it will happen.

To be honest, I've had the thought of just ending it all. And I don't mean harming myself, I mean just taking all the cash I can and disappearing completely. Starting a new life somewhere else, creating everything from the scratch and getting a second try at life. It sounds crazy even to me, but I just cannot end this endless circle I have gotten myself into otherwise.

Years after graduating from high school, I returned to my hometown after dropping out of my second attempt at higher education. I had work to keep me busy, a cat to keep me company, and a family supporting me no matter what I decided for myself. All I was missing was a friend. I reached out to someone who I hadn't spoken to since my senior year. I have always deeply admired her, and I find her to be easy to talk to and comfortable to be around. Kind, intelligent, strong, and truly amazing. We met up for coffee and a movie to catch up with one another. This led to growth in one of the most amazing friendships I have ever had. We worked together on a musical our old high school was running. Outside of the show, we spent a lot of time together as well, mostly in her room watching anime, music videos, or just talking. One day, I got into an argument with my mother shortly before I took a trip out of town. In the time before my flight, I went to her house to avoid my family and cool off. We did the same thing as usual, watching TV. But, at one point, I felt her hands in my hair. She began to unconsciously play with my hair and it deeply soothed me. It was then that I realized that I have very strong feelings for her. Now, I knew she didn't share those feelings. I was fully aware of this. But I also believed that it wasn't something i could keep to myself. I know that when I suppress this type of feeling, my behavior changes. I didn't want this to happen. So, on New Years of that year, I told her. I explained that I didn't want things to change. All i wanted was her friendship. A relationship wasn't something i could pursue at the time, but I also didn't want to hide my feelings. While she told me that she wouldn't ghost or avoid me, I haven't seen her since. We haven't spoken more than a sentence to each other since that day. I eventually gave up on reaching out. I didn't want to push her further. It's been over a year since we last spoke and I still feel exactly the same as I did back then. I don't see my feelings ever changing. But, more than anything, I just wish i could have my best friend back.",1,1735181903.0,venting,2,1.0,False

Advice? ,"Hi Reddit, I matched with this guy on Tinder on 12/11 he’s a total dream boat. He’s Swedish, takes great care of himself and if I’m being honest he’s totally out of my league. He’s also a bit older than me, 8 years. I’m 27F he’s 35M 

Anyways, I didn’t send him an initial message back until Saturday the 14th. We talked really briefly, he sent me his number then I got busy with life and work and stopped replying. Well Monday the 16th he sent me another message and that’s when I actually saw the message with his number. So I texted him. We had a really good flow of conversation with a couple hour breaks between messages, he knows I have other obligations and was just happy to get really in depth responses back when I could reply. He asked me to send him a selfie and I did. He called me wifey material. And then got really flirty. I asked him what he’s looking for and he told me: 

“I'm looking for a meaningful, consistent connection. Communication, and a relationship that develops naturally.

I would like something long term, but am open to other possibilities as long as there is mutual understanding about it.”

We had a super impromptu date Christmas Eve because I happened to be free on that day. It was amazing. We walked this nature trail area together and talked about life and our histories and just all kinds of topics. It was so cute everything was flowing so well. We went back to my car after our walk and listened to music for a couple hours. And then I had to leave. He was already talking a next date, and telling me how excited he is to get to know me. 

Well I texted him not long after I left because turned out my other obligations fell through and he said “I’d love to see you some more tonight before you have to go to work” so I told him I could send my address and we could hang out longer. I was at the gas station at the time and I didn’t think to say hey it’s gonna take me a min to get back home. I got home, and let my dog out to use the bathroom. It took about 20 mins. And then he texted me and asked if I was having 2nd thoughts. I said no and sent my address and explained what I had been doing. And then he sent me this: 

“I feel bad, but I'm getting a weird vibe. Just about coming over tonight.

Nothing against you, I like you and want to continue pursuing you. Coming over for an hour or so isn't sitting right with me.

What are your thoughts?”

I was like oh shit. And I called him, we talked on the phone he explained that while he was really excited to see me again for a little while that while he was waiting to get my address he started overthinking things and basically felt like maybe it was an overstep or I might have regretted inviting him over. We talked for probably 15 mins about it, I told him that wasn’t the case at all and he was right I probably should have said hey I’m leaving the gas station and I need to let my dog out when I get back home. I’ll send my address asap. He told me not to worry about it, I didn’t do anything wrong. He’s still into me, he’s just doubting hanging out tonight again. 

I told him I don’t want to push anything and if he’s uncomfortable with coming over that’s fine. But I really want to see him again and it’s gonna be at least 2 weeks before we could hang out in person after tonight. So he said what if I pick you up and we drive around and listen to music before you have to work? I was down. 

We did that, had an awesome time hanging out once again. We were holding hands and talking and just having a great time. I don’t think we even put music on we were just talking so much. 

He drops me back off at home and I’ve got about 30 mins before I need to leave to go to work. And I invite him inside for a few mins if he wants to no pressure at all. He agrees comes inside we’re hanging out in my living room and listening to music on the tv. We start kissing and it gets pretty hot n heavy. We didn’t do anything he didn’t even touch me aside from my neck, and holding my waist. In the heat of the moment I ended up in his lap making out. 

I’m still keeping an eye on time so I’m not late to work. And eventually I gotta kick him out so I can go to work. But we left in a great spot. He kissed me goodbye and said he’ll text me when he gets home. I told him I’d text him when I got to work. 

We talked for hours while I was at work until he fell asleep. (I work overnights) the conversation was really sexual but I kept being like hey remember I’m not looking for a hookup. I want something meaningful. I asked him how he felt about me as a person and he said: 

“The 4 hours that I know about you I like. Super cute, affectionate, able to speak your mind. I want to have dinner with you, get comfy cozy and watch a movie together. I want to know all your ins and outs” I told him I want the same. And then the conversation got sexual again I ended my last message by suggesting we should play pool on our next date. 

This morning at 11 he texted me back to my last message before he fell asleep and said: 

“Good morning cutie. I wonder how long we're going to last playing pool before we want to go home and get more hands on 💋

Time for me to make some coffee and get ready to hang out with my family for a bit.

Tell me about your day, how are you feeling?”

I was asleep at this point and texted him back when I woke up and after doing Christmas morning with my kids. It was about 3:30pm. I said: 

“Good Afternoon (morning for me) handsome. ❤️ haha I'm not sure but I plan on trying to be good. 😉

How was your coffee? And how is your family?

I'm feeling really good 😊 I just opened presents with my kiddos. And I got to watch my work kids open their presents this morning. I hope you've had a nice Christmas. Did your family get you anything?”

And then half an hour later I sent: “I took some selfies this morning if you might be interested? ☺️”

It’s now almost 6pm and I haven’t gotten a word back. I realize I’m probably just being anxious but I’m really worried that he might be still second guessing from last night. Or maybe he’s losing interest and I’m not sure what to do. Typically he doesn’t go longer than 20 mins without replying. I’m also concerned that despite all of his reassurance he may just want sex. Because all the times sex have come up in texting or in person it was him steering the conversation there. 

Should I just leave it alone and see what happens? Should I maybe try to call later? He told me at the end of our date the first time that he’s monogamous, and that he already wasn’t pursuing anyone else but if he had been after meeting me there was no way. And he asked that I would do the same if I felt like we had a strong spark. Which I definitely feel that we do. 

I’m worried I might have fucked it all up by having him over that second time and then not texting back until the afternoon. I’m worried he might think that I’m not as interested because it took a while for me to reply. 

I don’t want to kill this before it even really starts but I’m also not going to put out right away no matter how into him I am. It’s just a boundary for me. I want him to like me for my mind and personality and pursue that and something long term, not just my body. But idk I just have this really anxious bad feeling about his silence.  

And if you’re going to suggest that maybe he’s drunk or something because Christmas, he doesn’t drink or smoke or anything like that. In fact I was really nervous to disclose that I vape because I didn’t want that to be a huge turn off for him since he’s one of those fitness gym health conscious types. 

I don’t wanna be that annoying needy person and I don’t want to come across like I’m desperate so I’m trying to play it cool and wait for his reply but at the same time I want to reach out. 😩😔 help. ",0,1735180920.0,dating_advice,8,0.33,False

Because we are close in age compared to others in our group we were always compared but I would always shut that down along with any shit talk because I believe that she is a truly brilliant and hard working person, but I am learning she feeds into it. 

Situation: We typically catch up once or twice a year when I visit my home state, but our most recent interaction left me feeling hurt. We grabbed coffee and shared life updates. She rightfully takes pride in her job and the financial benefits it provides,  and while I also am blessed to live the life I want comfortably, I don’t feel comfortable talking about financials the way she does and usually phrase things as “I’m loving the work that I do and the people I work with”. I recently got a new job and when I told this to her she immediately tried digging into what the financial situation was, asking about benefits, rent, the employer, and the positions level, which I would briefly answer then try to change to talk about personal life, but she kept on going back to interrogating me. Not once did she smile or ask about my personal life, it was very clear that she only wanted to meet to figure out how well I was doing in life in a non-supportive way, and it left me feeling like I’m just a benchmark to her. While I plan to keep her at arms length, I do not want to cut her off and would like advice on how to respond to this secret competitiveness. 


Some ideas/questions:
- continue to phrase things in terms of personal fulfillment
- when she tries to be competitive, congratulate her on living the life she wants
- how do I stop her from asking personal financial questions? 
-when she asks them, how do I answer without sharing details?

Except Nespresso has phased out some of my fave pods, and they’ve increased prices a LOT. And, I originally bought the vertuo thinking I would use the coffee feature more than I do (I pretty much solely brew double espressos, whether double espresso dolce pods, using 2 altissimo pods, or doing the double tap trick on the seasonal coffee pods). 

For Christmas Costco had the pixie on a special, and I decided to get it. My vertuo machine is getting old and I’ve noticed some inconsistency with volume of shots sometimes. Plus, Costco and Sam’s club sell original line pods for cheap, not to mention there’s more variety/exclusives available. I tried the pixie today, and I HATE it. The output of the espresso is nearly nonexistent (it’s soooo piddly, there’s nearly nothing there) and it’s quite loud and I’m admittedly less familiar with the pods/functions. Brewing two “espresso” shots gives me a MUCH smaller volume than my vertuo does, and I’m not sure if I need to be using the lungo button, different pods, or if they’re just not comparable machines/shots.

Should I keep trying brewing methods/pods? Or should I return? Has anyone else had similar experiences switching from vertuo to original line?? Thanks!!

Edit: I used the scuro pods today (I’ve had the double espresso scuro a bit with vertuo so I thought it would be a good comparison) and it also did not taste the same",1,1735179871.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

I (40f) made christmas plans with my parents (66f) (68m)for them to come over for both Christmas eve and Christmas day. Christmas day they would stay until 3 pm because they had a 3 and a half hour ride home.  

A few days before christmas eve my sister (33f) (we haven't been on best terms) asked my mother what her plans were. My mother told me, so despite our strained relationship (figured it's time to let things go and make peace) I said I would invite her for christmas day and did. She said yes and the plans were made. 

We were originally going to do Chinese for dinner on christmas day but changed it once my sister was coming over because my parents said they would treat but changed it to me going half. (not my sister) We ended up buying a bunch of food to cook instead since that would be nicer. Christmas eve went smooth and my parents stayed in a hotel because that is what they like to do. 

The following day is where the disaster began. My parents were suppose to come at 9 am as the kids (19f,11m,8f,7f,) were waiting for them to open their presents under the tree and my mom loves watching and being involved. At 10 am i called my mom and this is where it all really started I informed my mother that my sister would not be making it over because her partner was ill throwing up since 4 am. I thought it was best since she was also nauseous (though not throwing up) she stay home and we make plans for another day when they aren't feeling ill. Mind you at this point it's been an hour and my mom had not even reached out to me about being late or anything.  

My mother totally lost it and flipped out on me. She went off the handle screaming on the phone how she was just going to go home. I ended the call here. A few minutes later she kept repeatedly calling me, my husbasnd and daughter, we didn't answer because we were trying to enjoy christmas with the kids. Like 15 min later i called my father because I felt at this point she was out of line and I had every right to inform my sister it's best since their sick that they stay home.  I hear my mother immediately yelling again. 

My father tells me they have to come to my house because after driving around all morning no restaurants were open and my mom needed to eat. It's a routine for them they always get breakfast out before coming to our house when they stay a night. My mother just likes eating out and uses any reason to do so even though I'm perfectly capable and willing to make food. So I agree and let her come. Apparently they stopped at 7 11 to get eggs as if I didn't have any... I really don't know why she does these things it feels insulting. So they both eat and she was upset the kids already opened the gifts when she said she wasnt coming and was already over an hour past 9 am, and then rushes to leave so they can get home by 4 for my sister to instead come to their house. 

Basically just blowing me and my family off leaving us with no christmas plans. They left in such a rush my oldest didn't even get to give her her christmas gift.  My oldest whose 19 was upset my younger kids were upset too. I felt this was extremely disrespectful and rude. I feel like they just came to eat and take thier chicken back that was going to be cooked today and take left over ham for my sister. And all of this because I didn't want someone knowingly sick in my house. So instead of staying until 3 on christmas day and arriving at 9 am they rushed to leave and left by 11ish am and first arrived 10 30 ish. She also had already celebrated the holidays with my sister a few weeks proir leaving us with no plans. We could have had my fil over for christmas day but didn't because they were suppose to be here and my mother doesn't really like him and my husband doesn't think he's really comfortable around them. Edit to add i should have said we could have invited my fil over for christmas day but it's highly unlikely he actually would have came because he's taking care of the aunt who can't travel at all and lives far away. He actually didn't even call today to wish the kids a merry Christmas he's very busy with what's going on in his life and I try to be understanding of it. 

2 hours after she leaves she messages me saying the hot chocolate and other coffees she brought to my home and told my oldest daughter were for her, were for my sister. 

AIW for feeling my mother disrespected my family and myself with her actions?

I have owned this grinder for several months now, and many kg of coffee has gone through it, and every day I need to change the grind settings because my first espresso, or two, either flows too fast, or too slow. I put in 20g of beans each time.

I know this can happen if the type of bean changes, eg, PNG to Brazil, and I accept that, but for the same bean roasted a week earlier?

Is this typical of all grinders, because the bean characteristics changes day to day, and that's just how it is? Or is this how larger capacity grinders work, and I should buy a single dose grinder?

I have a Lelit Bianca V3, if that matters. And I do use the paddle if the flow is too fast.",1,1735179566.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

1hmem3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Subliminal/comments/1hmem3m/since_2024_is_ending_everything_ive_manifested/,"Since 2024 is ending, everything I've manifested this year ","Aka my manifestation recap

  
Okay I don't remember the specific months where I manifested all this so bear with me as this won't be in order.

  
1. Glowup--I had the most amazing glowup  this year(a  continuation from my 2023  manifestation and will continue as I want to manifest being even prettier) like legit heard I was hot, sexy and gorgeous way too many times, had me kicking my feets and twirling my hair. One girl (her first words when we actually talked together) said that every time she saw me walking, she wanted to talk to me because i'm such a baddie, you don't know how that brought such a smile to my face and one time I was being fake cocky with my friend going like 'i'm so gorgeous blah blah' and she was like 'you are tho'. Also more: So, when I was younger I use to have a weird obsession with kind of plucking my lashes, when I use to have very long thick lashes and this year I wasn't really manifested long lashes that much but my lashes grew so much still. 

  
2. Metabolism--I really fixed my metabolism thanks to manifestation this year. Like no matter how much I binge I never gain weight, I just maintain, and I don't get constipated the same way I used to get last year.

  
3. Fashion-- Now I am not yet done manifesting my dream closet, but I'm close enough. This year has been a huge fashion game changer for me and I mean this by a LOTT, I went to dressing like Idgaf about life to giving 90s-2010s sitcom it girl fits. Someone told me I always keep serving, and they want my closet and I get complimented on my outfits a lot like. When I went out with my friends yesterday and they saw a cute fit, they were like 'omg this is so you'  Honestly getting complimented on my fits is a never ending experience. (also got my dream white sweater  for christmas today)

  
4. Friends--Okay, so I came new to this place a year ago and I didn't have much of a stable friendgroup where we actually go out and hang out together and text often, but I've manifested a really close group of friends and being a floater. Me and my friends now hang out often, go to the malls, each other houses, grab a cup of coffee, send each other random memes.

  
5. Personality change-- I use to be a lot more introverted (I'm still a  little bit like that) before but now my introvert side kinda dying out and I'm becoming more outgoing, fun, and free spirited.

  
6. Money-- something weird keeps happening to me when it comes to money but that's probably my fault, but anyways I'm never broke. Like I always have money with me even when I use it all,  money comes and goes easily for me.

  
7. Already shared this one but grades--lately, i've been giving rory gilmore, annabeth chase, hermione Granger etc when it comes to good grades, like I've been doing so well academically and get rewarded for it. Lowest grade rn a 95 and the rest 99s-100s.

  
8. Jewelry: I didn't have that much jewelry before but now I have a lot of jewerly (especially earrings and necklaces/pendants. Also got more of them for Christmas) (Also off topic but not really, so as I'm writing this i'm scrolling through my pinterest board and I just realize the necklace I got for christmas looks almost exactly to the one I have pinned on my board, it's this one https://www.pinterest.com/pin/1010635972626892024/)

  
9.Okay this one was a stupid one, but I manifested seeing bright car colors--I wanted to test my skills and all that, so I just told myself I'll see unusual/bright car colors and I kept seeing very bright red and bright blue cars.

  
10. Travel--i grew up travelling a lot and don't really do it anymore, so  I manifested travelling again and I got news I'll travel next year.

  
11. Vision--I didn't manifest perfect vision, because though I do want 20/20 vision I'm kind of attached to my glasses (i like wearing my glasses to compliment my makeup I fear) but anyways when I saw that my vision was worsening, I quickly manifested it to get better and guess what happened, it got better!!

  
my 2025 goals: Glow up even more, height (the hardest to manifest💔 I want to grow taller so badly), awards, becoming very rich, continue with grades, all of my pinterest boards desires.

  
Anyways, would like to see everyone's recaps

1hmelqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hmelqf/my_38f_partner_42f_is_destroying_my_life_i_think/,"My (38F) partner (42F) is destroying my life I think, what can I do? ","What do you think the best course of action would be to either fix (if fixable) this relationship or to safely leave it with the least amount of damage for both of us?

We’ve been together 6 years. To put it bluntly I’ve never been so miserable in my entire life and I’ve been in extremely physically and mentally abusive relationships in the past. I feel like I’ve lost my complete sense of self through the course of this relationship but to be fair other things have happened in the course of it as well (Covid, and the suicide of my long time best friend). 

My mental health has been declining rapidly. I don’t know if I’m being gaslit or if I’m gaslighting her or if we’re both just equally toxic or if it at all matters. 

We are both diagnosed with PTSD, borderline (mine is mostly in remission), depression, anxiety and she has really bad ADHD that significantly impacts her daily functioning (she doesn’t take her meds as prescribed because she sells some of them to make money). She has been unemployed for a couple years now and has been living off of an inheritance she got in 2020 but is down to about $6,000 and has been very nonchalant about taking action to find a job/income. I am truly afraid we will lose our housing. She pays her half of the rent and utilities. But aside from that, I am taking the brunt of other bills (gas, groceries, household items, everything our cats need, etc). 

One of my biggest frustrations and the cause of fights for years now is the imbalance in our relationship. I cook, I do the dishes, I clean, I wake up before her every morning to feed the cats/get them water/clean their boxes/give them their medicine, she won’t even get out of bed until I bring her coffee. I do all the grocery shopping. I keep track of what we’re running low on and make lists of what we need (groceries, cat food, litters, their meds, etc). I deep clean the cat boxes once a week. I change the trash. I break down the recycling and bring it to the basement. Etc. 
the whole six years I’ve known her she’s cooked for me less than 5 times. She’s woken up before me less than 5 times. In the last two months she’s washed dishes maybe a few times. If I ask her she might bring the trash out. A lot of her not doing chores/forgetting is blamed on her ADHD. I am aware that this is a factor. I’ve tried to be understanding of this but after awhile it feels like an excuse and cop out when I’m dealing with the worst treatment resistant depression of my life for about 5 years straight now to the point where I’m seeking alternative treatments (things aside from therapy and meds). 
When I was in the very beginning stages of grieving by best friends death she wouldn’t even wake up before me to help me with the cats. She wouldn’t cook me dinner. She wouldn’t wash the dishes. I could barely get out of bed but I HAD to because I love my cats and they’re dependent on us. She’d just lay in bed next to me. I asked her over and over to please help me in the ways I needed. She wouldn’t. 

I used to commute to work which turned my days into 12-13 hour days/5 days a week. The amount of work she’d put in around the house (mind you she still wasn’t working at this point) didn’t change. 

She is the most codependent person I’ve ever met. I used to be independent. I loved (needed and still need as I’m a true introvert) my alone time. I used to love taking myself out on dates. Or just going to get my hair done alone. Some of the best times in my life were simple, solo weekend getaways for a night or two - just me. 

In this relationship, that sense of self is completely obliterated. She’s gotten to the point of crying when I’ve told her I want to go to the store alone. I can’t even go to doctors appointments or hair appointments alone. To be fair, within the last couple months she’s been a little better and I have been able to do grocery shopping by myself which is my one escape from her aside from work. 
When I do have plans with just me and my sister (rare) it causes a huge emotional reaction in her. She becomes afraid and that fright turns into … I don’t know if you’d call it control or manipulation or guilting? Basically she tells me she’s afraid I’ll die in a car accident or get roofied. The second I leave the house she starts texting me (while I’m driving - the irony) usually saying something to make me worried/feel bad, such as she thinks one of our cats is sick or acting off or that she’s really depressed, etc. she’ll text me throughout the night.

She twists my words a lot. Or plays with my memories of events until I question everything that’s happened. Timelines, words, people involved, etc. I don’t know if she does it on purpose or not but I’ve started taking notes on my phone so I can remember things she’s said/did so I don’t feel so crazy all the damn time. 

Our sex life has become nonexistent and I’ll take the blame for this. I have no sexual interest in her. Even kissing or hugging her feels like I’m being assaulted. To be clear, she’d NEVER make me do anything I didn’t want to do. I just force myself to kiss her because I truly feel bad. But my body recoils and I have this trauma response. The idea of being sexual with her makes me feel physically ill. I’m attracted to her. We’ve had great chemistry in the past. It’s not that. It’s just our relationship as a whole. It doesn’t make me want to be intimate with her. 
I see that this kills her and I feel horrible but I don’t know what do. 

I know this is A LOT. I apologize. I don’t have a lot of outlets. I do see a therapist. Sometimes I talk to my sister but she just wants me to up and leave her and it’s not that easy. 

My partner has basically told me she’d die without me and that our cats would too. 

I could really use some advice. Is there anything healthy or salvageable here. Anything I can improve upon. 

I’m considering couples counseling but I’m afraid the therapist will just read me like a book instantly and see I’m done. At this point I feel such disdain. Such anger. I’m irritable all the time. I’m mean to her. My words cut. I very rarely smile. I’m not innocent either. But I’m not who I used to be. I’m someone I’ve never been in any other relationship. I feel like a shell. Leaving isn’t simple because neither of us could afford to live alone. Our cats are covid cats and unsocialized outside of me and her (and have health concerns) they’re both extremely attached to us both. I couldn’t rip them apart. And it would break my heart to ever take them from her. I don’t know what to do. ",0,1735179347.0,relationship_advice,3,0.25,False

1hmelb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausadhd/comments/1hmelb4/new_to_vyvanse_and_need_advice/,New to vyvanse and need advice ,"Hi all.  I am in need of some advice about vyvanse. 

I was recently diagnosed with inattentive ADHD and put on 30mg of vyvanse.  My psychiatrist scheduled me for a follow-up appointment 3 months later in mid January, due to closure over the holidays. 

When I first started taking vyvanse it worked well and had no side effects.  Then it seemed like it wasn't working enough, so I started taking 1x 80mg caffeine tablet in the mornings to help keep my energy up, and then would take vyvanse around midday. 

I would also drink approximately 500ml of Coca-Cola  throughout the evening, which has approximately 50mg of caffeine.  So all up I was having the equivalent of 2 cups of coffee per day. 

I should explain that I work nights (until 12:30pm) and my psychiatrist advised me to take vyvanse around lunchtime, so I didn't crash halfway through my work shift. 

I recently started taking iron and vitamin b supplements on the advice of my GP because I am deficient. 

Last week, I suddenly started feeling off.  My vyvanse crash was more intense, and it made me feel really strug out and anxious.  Then, the stomach symptoms happened. 

I started getting indigestion and felt really sick, like I was going to vomit all the time.  My head was spinning, I had no appetite, and I got hot flashes. I stopped the iron and caffeine and kept talking the vyvanse. 

Yesterday, I tried not taking vyvanse, but I still felt sick and then felt really tired and got a headache.

I have also lost about 7kg since starting the medication about 5 weeks ago. 

I know I should visit a doctor, but they are closed for the holidays. 

I just wanted to know if anyone else experienced similar symptoms on vyvanse and how you overcame them.  Or if you think it might have been the caffeine.
