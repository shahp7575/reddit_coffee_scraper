1puqy6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoShillReviews/comments/1puqy6s/review_of_hp_14_laptop_intel_celeron_n4020_4_gb/,"Review of HP 14 Laptop, Intel Celeron N4020, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB Storage, 14-inch Micro-edge HD Display, Windows 11 Home, Thin & Portable, 4K Graphics, One Year of Microsoft 365 (14-dq0040nr, Snowflake White)","Fourteen-inch laptops priced like MacBook Pros usually offer more than a Celeron and 64 GB of eMMC.

The listing swears this thing will stream 4K, but the Intel UHD 600 in the N4020 can barely push 1080p without stuttering. Calling it ""4K ready"" feels like calling a bicycle ""Autobahn ready"" because it could theoretically roll onto the on-ramp.

Four gigs of RAM and 64 GB of storage land squarely in 2015 Chromebook territory. Pair that with Windows 11 S and you get a machine that panics when Chrome, Spotify, and Word all open at once. Cloud storage becomes mandatory, not optional.

HP did nail the travel angle-1.5 kg and a tiny bezel make it painless to sling into a backpack. The Snowflake White shell also hides fingerprints better than basic black plastic. Still, good portability does not justify the price.

4,564 happy reviewers paid around $200-$250 on Amazon US, where this model normally lives. The $1,575 tag on this page screams marketplace scalping or a fat finger error. At fifteen hundred bucks you could buy three faster Ryzen laptops and still have change for coffee.

If someone absolutely needs the cheapest possible Windows box for email and Google Docs, hunting down the real Amazon listing makes sense. Paying premium prices for bargain-bin specs only benefits whoever listed this before their coffee kicked in.

I had really really crooked teeth and 4 years ago, my dentist suggested crowns on the top front 6. Within 6 months, I noticed what looked like staining. He told me to avoid smoking, coffee etc. which I don’t do. I brush regularly and don’t have a lot of trouble with other teeth. 

He wants $5k to fix them. I just had to get a root canal on one and I’m having a lot of discomfort on another. I have a different dentist checking into this next week. My dentist says this is my fault. What are your thoughts? I would have never done this if I knew they would look like this and cause me this much pain.

\-you’re not too much

\-your needs are just as valid and as important as NT ones

\-if you’ve forgotten or messed anything up, it’s okay. 

Take your meds, do something that feels good to you and rest/recuperate when you can. 

——-

Choose your own expression of care/comfort/being seen. I’ve got enough solid and tight parent-hugs, joking high-fives, and knowing head nods for everybody. 

First off, take a breath, shake it all off, unclench, sip some water, scream profanities into a pillow, or whatever you need to feel yourself. 

Next is a bit about how I see the holidays from my AuDHD perspective, skip to the \*\*\* if you don’t need that and just want the feeling better part:

The holidays are a shitshow of sensory stimulation, social situations, and emotional arousal of all kinds, while also disrupting any kind of routines we manage to cobble together normally. 

And as if that wasn’t enough, we’re also supposed to be with family having the most wonderful magical time of the year - so we get hit twice with the potential to get caught up in literal thinking with binary self-judgement of pass/fail over impossible expectations (especially as women/AFABs socially conditioned to see these things as our responsibilities). 

AND are supposed to put aside any complex feelings about families with whom we’re very likely to have complex histories (to say the least).

Fuck, I’m tired and overwhelmed just writing that. 

But it’s ok, because knowing is half the battle. And this season of chaos will pass. 

\*\*\*

Naming our real feelings and what’s happening to our nervous systems and bodies helps and is often a new thing for those of not diagnosed until later on. 

So feel free to drop a comment about the truth of how you’re doing, in full-blown AUDHD style: ramble, info dump, curse, the brutal truth you’d never say out loud IRL, let it all hangout folks! 

Give it all to us:

\-your honest thoughts about the abomination of nature that is Aunt Nancy’s cooking that everyone raves over

\-that you love your kids but wish they’d all shut the f\*ck up and decide to spend an hour doing krampus-knows-what in their rooms so you can breathe and actually finish a single thought in your own head

\-why Elf is a terrible movie and EVERYTHING you love about the extended versions of the LOTR trilogy

\-what you wanted to scream at your \[older family member\] when they commented on your \[diagnoses/weight/love life/kids’ behaviour/orientation/gender/political perspective/how you drink your frickin’ coffee\] - I know you lot could come up with some good profanity combinations ;)

\-your screaming roar of pain and rage into the void of hellfire that is our current timeline

AND/OR, tell me what makes your little ASD-goblin side cackle with glee?

That song on repeat, a hoodie that sits just right, flicking at the corner of the pillow on the couch, a specific brand of pickles eaten from the jar standing over the sink and staring blankly out the window…

And for the rest of the holidays, do the weird thing that feels like home and who you really are…

…and do your best to find moments of actual rest that help your system let go and unwind when you can.

1puqt7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1puqt7g/2_years_postop_raw_stomachaches/,"2 years post-op, raw stomachaches","Curious if this happens to anyone else and what to do about it. 

I had my gallbladder out \~2 years ago. Surgery went well, recovery was super smooth, no issues. I can eat normally. I was able to stop thinking about it. Some things, like coffee, go right through me but what else is new. 

Lately -- as in, past three months or so -- something's different. I've been getting stomachaches that feel slightly similar to pre-op days. Not like gallbladder attacks, those are completely gone and done. But more like a raw, burning pain and I can't ever truly figure out how to deal with it. Eating sometimes helps, but also that's tricky because when I feel gross I don't want to eat. I also don't like/want the solution to be ""lol keep snacking all day long."" 

The go-to foods that used to help (carbs, shredded wheat) aren't impacting it. I had frosted miniwheats this morning, same as always. I am in pain now again. It's been maybe 3 hours. 

I feel like it's bile related because that just... makes sense. Like it FEELS like that. The burning/raw sensation. Also I feel like I get a bad taste in my mouth (this is new, this has never happened before). Like I feel compelled to eat something (tired of this) or brush my teeth to make it go away, and then an hour or so later I feel the same thing again. 

It's been years since surgery. I never had these issues before. 

It's ANNOYING and uncomfortable.

1puqs6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1puqs6r/my_pre_op_prep_and_first_week_journey/,My pre op prep and first week journey,"TL;dr there’s a shopping list at end!

Pre-op - I was honestly really excited and looking forward to it then a couple days before I realized, whoa this is major surgery and that’s just gonna suck! Along with all over the place recovery times and trying to figure out time off/work schedule. I have unlimited time off but my boss is a bitch. It’s me. I’m self employed. We deep cleaned house and did all the laundry. I didn’t take stool softener bc my stools are too soft anyway but 2 days before, I did a senna & epsom salt tea to really clear out.

I also got a massage which I HIGHLY recommend. I work out a lot and I regret not prioritizing yoga, stretching & rolling out instead I decided to lift heavy right before bc I wouldn’t be able to for months and I was super sore. I didn’t have much anxiety/nervousness since I’m not prone to that anyway and bc I knew this would be best. I was able to talk to friends who had hystos, and so many people sharing on Reddit/tiktok. 

Day of surgery 

Pre surgery drink that’s like liquid IV

No BM before surgery - drats! Too early and off my reg schedule 

My surgery was about an hour - surgeon told me it was done sooner than expected and generally means quicker recovery 

Woke up extremely hoarse but already hungry. I probably whispered, Taco.  I immediately had to pee.  Peed twice before I left.  This is normal for me. Was absolutely shoved out of recovery and was in and out of consciousness. I had my gf or best friend with me but the discharge nurse is going to get a formal complaint bc among other things didn’t lock the door when I was in the bathroom and someone ELSE came in. PLEASE talk to your doctor and trusted pick up person about what the discharge should look like and make sure your carer can advocate for you. 

I had my usual smoothie (Vega protein, almond milk, almond butter, greens & half a banana). Then my usual breakfast of coffee, farro, egg & pesto. 

Went for a 20m slow walk on flat ground. 

Ordered a ton of veggie Vietnamese take out so we didn’t have to cook, pho was soothing for throat and fresh greens/herbs especially mint would help me. 

Pro tip - having takeout the first week was SO helpful for both me & my partner to just reheat something. We always make quick meals anyway but just being able to reheat to save time & energy was great. 

Had gas but bearable, kinda in shoulders but tbh way less pain & discomfort than my usual gas/bloating pre surgery issues. Pretty lucid and in pain/tenderness but feeling pretty good. UNTIL I tried to lay down on my wedge pillow with other pillows and gas pains shot thru my shoulders and made me wide awake. I took oxy at night and unfortunately it had little effect on me. I woke up a few hours later and took cbd/thc edibles to relax, ease pain and get me to sleep. So much for taking time off cannabis.  I got a rx for ambien to ensure rest 

Pro tip: bc the Rx’s were take as needed, I wrote down what I took & time I took it to keep track with dry erase markers on my bathroom mirror. 

Post op Day 1

Brekkie of oatmeal, apple, chia seeds; coffee, green juice & prunes. 

POOP SUCCESS. I sent engraved invites to poop positive households. Since my symptoms were extremely loose stools, this was my first well formed success in I dunno how long. But I concur it was SCARY. 

20m walk and 10m of stretching. Like what I was able to safely and comfortably do. Not whatever the peloton instructor said. 

Usual smoothie, shower, rest. Typical lunch, rest. Typical dinner, 20m walk, edibles, Zootopia.  I took an ambien and magnesium citrate and got 10 solid hours

Day 2 - feeling more fatigued today like a delayed reaction from anasthesia like delayed muscle soreness. Ate usual, walk & stretch, rest.  Mint tea. Took edibles. Took ambien & magnesium. Didn’t sleep as well, my throat was dry.  The throat pain has been unreal wtf did I deep throat in surgery? A spiked club? I was only there for an hour and it’s the worst throat pain I can recall.  

Day 3 - feeling fatigued & nausea. Taking edibles. Otherwise typical meals, rest and 2 20m walks again. 

Day 4 -  not feeling quite as nauseous & fatigued. Moved into the cozy Christmas phase and ordered a bunch of random peppermint & chocolate.  Somewhat from the edibles but I find myself ravenous and bodies needs a lot of calories to heal. Still having typical meals and 2 20m walks 

—first self orgasm wahoo!

Day 5- I couldn’t take my overdue mani pedi anymore and got fresh nails but had my gf drive me and carry everything.  Still feeling slightly nauseous/fatigue but continuing to walk & eat normally. Right now this would be a couple days before my period would start so I’m paying attention to my body with that in mind. 

Day 6 - went to outdoor food market bc it’s usually chill, was more crowded/intense than I expected. I wish I brought a cane to signify to others to make space. Screaming, PROTECT THE ANTI WOMB yielded mixed results. Ate as usual but didn’t do anymore walking bc I did enough.  

Day 7 - more energy but still resting. I told my gf, “it kills me that I can’t help with housekeeping” but that’s a fckn lie 🤣🤣🤣 usual meals and walk.  About now is the typical start of my period. My dr said I could take naproxen so trying that bc it seemed to really help the one period cycle I took it with. 

—truly maginificent self orgasm, I almost squirted

Day 8 - I think I mildly annoyed my innards with last night’s hitachi session. Will cool my jets. 

I’m kinda bored? Like I can’t quite work yet but physically I can’t do much.  I’m trying less edibles but still ravenous.  I’ve always been a good eater but I’m surprised how hungry I am despite laying around more than I’ve ever done in years.

if any of you are looking to support other booktubers that actually care about their videos and have genuine passion towards their content id really really suggest looking up **sarah hafidh** on youtube. i only accidently came across her channel earlier today but was immedietly hooked and was so suprised when i saw she didnt have more engagement across her videos. shes in her late 20s and has only been posting for a year but already has over 200 videos, book reccomendations and challenges, reading vlogs, book hauls and shopping alongside vlogish content were she shows her life in not just 'aesthetic' montage clips but realistic days that include her love for reading and overall you can tell her heart is really in it. this authentic lifstyle portrayal that includes book content is soemthing ive been missing from steph for a long time; not to keep on comparing the two, however ive seen many posts on here of people searching for new people to watch that dont have this oversaturated persona and id really reccomend her videos. theres an element of realness to it all which i think is so hard to find within creators these days as also unfortunately highlighted by this subreddit. its so dishertening to see the youtubers that really try with their content get not even half as much views as 3 back to back 'cosy day at home' vidoes of a girl painting her wall and complaining about editing once every two weeks lol. 

ive already watched a few of sarah hafidhs videos some book related some less and have to say she has very similair interests to steph and bases her content around things i used to love hearing her talk about, but more authentically and entertainingly. she has moments with her friends, days in the life as a girl in her 20s, even a coffee addict and talked about the summer i turned pretty if ur really searching for specifics and care about that stuff. her book taste is a bit different but i find that really interesting and overall if you are looking for new videos to substitude id 100% reccomend hers.

as someone who used to really love steph and enjoy her videos its such a shame to see her channel become so lackluster and have no heart in it, however theres so much good content in this realm still out there that i think we should start engaging with instead of nitpicking on stephs choices we know arent going to change!!!!

1puqkeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/sidehustle/comments/1puqkeo/started_doing_promo_posters_for_local_shops_on/,Started doing promo posters for local shops on weekends. Found a way to speed up the design part without losing quality.,"I've been doing graphic design work for local coffee shops and small restaurants on the side for about 2 months now. Nothing huge, just weekend gigs—$75-120 per poster depending on how many revisions they want.

Started with one client (a friend's coffee shop), then got 2-3 more through word of mouth and our local Facebook business group.

The problem was time. Each poster used to take me 2-3 hours because I'd either:

* Start from scratch in Photoshop (slow, but custom)
* Use Canva templates that break when I change text or images (fast, but frustrating)

Most weeks I could only handle 2 clients because of my day job. That's about $150-240 per weekend.

Three weeks ago, a bakery owner showed me a poster she found on Pinterest and asked if I could make something ""with that vibe"" for her holiday sale.

I was procrastinating on YouTube (as you do) and came across one of those ""AI tools for designers"" videos. One tool they showed was X-Design, basically copies the layout from a reference image but uses your own stuff. Figured I'd test it instead of spending 2 hours trying to recreate that Pinterest poster manually.

Here's what happened:

**First try:** Logo came out squished, text was all wrong. Took me like 10 minutes to figure out the aspect ratio settings, then ran it again.

**Second try:** Way better. Client changed her mind halfway through (from ""Holiday Special - $12.99"" to ""New Year Sale - $14.99""), and I just swapped the text. Layout stayed intact. Would've been annoying to redo that in Photoshop.

**Third client (last weekend):** Used the same layout structure for a different coffee shop. Just swapped branding, colors, text. Done in 40 minutes instead of 2+ hours.

One client tried to lowball me to $50 because ""it's just AI though, right?"" Had to explain that the design thinking, matching their brand, and polishing everything still takes work—the tool just handles the boring layout part. We settled on $90.

**Time saved:** 

* Before: 2-3 hours per poster
* Now: 45-60 minutes (still tweaking fonts, colors, spacing manually)

**Money impact:**  Since I'm finishing faster, I've been reaching out to more local shops. Now doing 3 clients most weekends instead of 2. That's an extra $75-120 per weekend, roughly $300-480/month.

Not gonna lie, the tool isn't perfect. I still fix spacing, adjust font weights, tweak colors, and sometimes redo sections that look off. But it saves me from staring at a blank canvas trying to figure out the layout from scratch.

This works best if:

* Your clients need repeatable stuff (weekly promos, seasonal menus, event posters)
* You're okay using AI but still want control over the final result
* You're time-limited, not client-limited

Doesn't work well for clients wanting something super unique or artistic. This is more for functional promo stuff.

One more thing—be upfront if clients ask. I don't advertise ""I use AI,"" but if they ask about my process, I tell them I use tools to speed up layout work. Most don't care as long as the final result looks good and matches their brand.

Let me dissect this:

**You create a cause in your mind. According to the degree and quality of that cause, you produce an effect in 3D reality.**

So, for example let's say you're manifesting $100k in your bank account. If can be challenging to picture yourself in such a situation if you've never experienced it compared to someone who already had rich parents and have witnessed abundance of money since they were born.

So the ""quality"" of the cause (imagination) is not great. But you're still moving the needle, you're reality is still changing and is still producing effects in the 3D according to the quality of the cause (your imagination).

***Cause -> Effects to the degree and quality of the cause -> the potential for the cause increases -> the potential of the effect also increases -> the potential/quality of your cause greatly increases -> potential of effect increases tenfold -> -> -> -> $100k in your bank account.***

How does this apply in the real world?

Let's assume you've never experienced financial freedom and you want to manifest $100k:

You imagine having $100k in your bank account (cause)  
Nothing happens (effect)  
You imagine having $100k in your bank account (cause)  
You found a penny while you were walking down the road (effect)  
You feel grateful for it and thank the universe for giving you a sign for the abundance to come (cause)  
Your friend paid for your coffee (effect)  
You thank the universe, you imagine your wife reacting to you having $100k in your account (cause)  
You get discounts, offers that you wouldn't usually get (effect)  
You imagine a scene of you having $100k & carry that state throughout (cause)  
You got a job promotion increasing your income 10x (effect)  
You imagine a scene of you having $100k & carry that state throughout (cause)  
You automatically develop spending habits of someone who has $100k (effect)  
You imagine having $100k in your bank account (cause)  
You get an idea of starting a business, you start it (effect)  
....  
......  
.........  
.............  
................  
You have $100k in your bank account (EFFECT)

Notice how the bridge of events unfolds. You'll never know how your manifestation will occur so there's no point in trying to figure out the ""how"". You'll receive the answer to your ""how"" from the universe.

And notice this: you'll get ideas, mental nudges, compulsion to take certain actions. **YOU MUST TAKE THEM.** They are from your intuition which is your inner tuition / inner guidance. These actions will lead you to your bridge of events, and those events will take you to your desire. All you need to do is flow with your intuition.

And notice one more thing: in the above example, you keep using your imagination/any practice you do. **CONSISTENCY IS IMPORTANT AT ALL COSTS** (especially in the state you carry throughout the day), **IT IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.**

And notice one last thing (i know i'll stop): in the above example, for all small manifesations you get, **you THANK the universe, you feel GRATEFUL for it**, you NOTICE these small manifestations, the small abundance that is coming your way. The universe doesn't know the concepts of ""small"" or ""big"" from it's infinite perspective. SO be sure to be AWARE of all the good that is coming your way and be thankful instead of whining and complaining like a spoiled pretentious entitled little brat because daddy didn't get you what you wanted.

And the bridge of events I've described in the above example, it is an EXAMPLE and there's no time period that what will manifest when. I intentionally didn't include the time period on when the person will get the $100k because no one but god knows it and it's futile trying to manifest something with a strict timeframe (unless you can go into ABSOLUTE KNOWING that you already have your desire)

Hope this helps.

i'mi a very private person, been through some emotional trauma so i don't trust people much... i just liked talking to him a lot and i knew he liked sports, and i watch a little so i would always talk to him about basketball, and he liked football so i'd ask how his team is doing...

yesterday when this manager girl on a power trip told me to go home and that i'm fired in the middle of a lunch rush, this guy stepped in and tried to talk her out of it... he saw me crying a bit and i told him what's going on, and he said ""hold on, let me go talk to her""

she still decided to fire me because for a couple minutes i ran out of something, ridiculous.

anyways, when i left he said, ""i'm really sorry mike"" and it felt so sincere.

i got his number from a coworker after i got home, and sent him a text thanking him for being so down to earth and kind, and that i hope he has a good holidays.

a few hours later at night he texted me back and said 'no problem!"" and how he hopes things go well, and how he's very sorry, and that he hopes things go well in the future and that i have a good holiday and new years.

i was thinking of texting him in a few days after the holidays, to see if he wants to hang out... would that be appropriate? maybe we could just get some coffee as friends or something... would this be weird?

The few 72hr fasts I’ve done so far, I’ve had rice as my main carb (eaten with fish and greek yogurt), but since I switched to chickpeas (a more complex carbs) I’ve noticed a bit of smoother transition from glucose/fat burning into ketosis. 

I’m currently 54hrs in and about to go to sleep. The only negative effects I’ve had were a bit of drowsiness (noticed during the 30-54h mark), and a bit of cold chills (around the same time).

Surprisingly, the strongest hunger pangs I’ve had so far were between the 18-30h mark, but they were not extreme and easily subdued. I think the comblex carbs form chickpeas made the transition from a normal omad fast to an extended one easier compared to fasts I did with rice as my main carb.

In terms of non-water liquids, I had one coffee with a pinch of pink salt around 20h mark (helped me poop), the rest of the fast I did have occasional watered down electrolyte drink that I sipped throughout, and one capsule of magnesium citrate. 

For refeeding, I’ve already meal-prepped (helps prevent a “in the moment” binge when refeeding). I’m planing on a veggie soup with a splash of lemon first, 15-30mins later I’ll have two boiled eggs, one sliced tomato, one sliced avocado (all salted with pink salt).

So, in the meantime, my wife went down to the local third-wave coffee shop and bought a bag to do us in the meantime.

The thing is, she brought it back and the roast date was middle of September. Given the generally accepted wisdom of beans going stale roughly around 6-weeks post roasting, I was a bit annoyed.

But then, I went to the DAK website because I remembered that they sell second chance coffee beans like the following:

  
[https://secondchancedakcoffeeroasters.com/products/strawberry-jelly-espresso-bensa-ethiopia-heirloom-anaerobic-natural-well-rested-batch-1kg-copy](https://secondchancedakcoffeeroasters.com/products/strawberry-jelly-espresso-bensa-ethiopia-heirloom-anaerobic-natural-well-rested-batch-1kg-copy)

which was roasted in October.

Now, I know the beans are discounted (whereas the ones my wife bought were not), but it just got me thinking... the people who buy from DAK are typically going to be on the snobby end of coffee drinkers and would likely baulk at the idea of buying stale beans. And DAK themselves are clearly quite a serious roaster who I presume care about their reputation. Yet, they sell these second chance beans and people clearly buy them (otherwise they wouldn't sell them).

So, it just got me thinking...

Who is buying these beans? And what for?

Is there still a decent bit of life left in these beans that my wife bought presuming that we store them well? ",1,1766591174.0,espresso,13,0.67,False

The scans show basic brainwave patterns, just how busy or strained the brain looks during focus.

After coffee, my brain stayed in a pretty strong high-alert mode. I felt focused, but also a bit tense and more fatigued afterward. It worked, but it felt effortful.

With matcha, the focus looked calmer. Less of the tight, wired feeling, and less fatigue. I still felt alert, but without that sense of pushing.

This is just one person, one day, and not advice. I mostly found it interesting how different the quality of focus felt between the two.",4,1766591167.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

I was going to do our first Christmas, maybe tomorrow. I penned this over coffee this morning using her journal as a reference. Thank you for following along in our journey.

For Ashley and little A

October 25, 2008

One week after the Thai-food-marathon first date and we were already acting like we’d been together for years - or maybe a thousand lifetimes. I picked her up at 6:00 sharp. She answered the door in jeans and a fitted emerald-green top that made me forget how to form sentences.

One look and I just pulled her in and kissed her hello like I’d been doing it forever. She laughed against my mouth and said, “Hi to you too, gentleman.”

We headed back to downtown Savannah. On the ride, her hand found mine like it belonged there. There was something about the way her skin felt against mine that felt right. Conversation never lagged. As I said, it’s like we’ve known each other our entire lives. 

Since we always had fun in whatever we did, I decided to try something a little different - a “fun” date, one I called a trifecta. I called it this because it was a series of three games in which the loser buys drinks - or whatever. With both of us being extremely competitive, it made for a very fun - and entertaining - night. 

My plan was the games, then pizza, music, and whatever else we could find.

Game One 

We stopped at a little underground bar in City Market that has a small stage for live music. I let her pick the first game. She chose foosball and proceeded to completely destroy me. I will admit, I suck at the game. Every time she scored, she’d smile and give me a consolation kiss. Maybe it wasn’t a loss after all. I paid for round one - St. Pauli’s Girl for us. 

Game Two 

Darts at McDonough’s. I finally won something. She claimed I “cheated by breathing on her neck” during her last throw and popped me on the arm quite hard. Was sore for while after. She bought round two while laughing about how she’d get me the next one. 


Game Three 

Shuffleboard at Bay Street Blues. Closest match of the night. She edged me out on the very last puck. I was a bit distracted by her ‘form,’ but that’s no excuse. I bought round three, plus shots because she declared “we’re celebrating anyway.” By this point we were feeling good, laughing too loud, and holding hands across every table like teenagers.

We stopped Vinnie Van GoGo’s in City Market for the best pizza in Savannah, hands down. We split a pizza on the patio even though it was chilly and sat side-by-side so we could keep touching. A killer blues band was playing nearby. She kept stealing my crusts and feeding me bites and every piece was like a reminder that the best things in life are simple, hot, and meant to be shared with the person who feels like home.

After eating we made our way, walking hand in hand, to Lulu’s Chocolate Bar for dessert. 
We ordered two chocolate martinis and sat in the plush red booth in the back. She licked the chocolate off the rim of her glass, looked me dead in the eye, and said “You’re in trouble.“ I believed her.

In one of our many conversations while she was in Iraq she talked about ghosts in Savannah - she loved that sort of thing. So, I took her to Moon River Brewery, supposedly one of the most haunted buildings in Savannah. This is the part that we laughed about for a long time, as it was one of the few times I’ve seen Ashley truly scared. We’d heard the basement was haunted, so of course we had to go investigate. The basement was sort of a pool hall, for lack of better description, as it had several tables. On that particular night, no one was playing so it was empty. We were warned.  Even though it was lighted, it was still darker than the other rooms and the brick walls and old barrels added to the whole creepy vibe.

We were at the bottom of the stairs, giggling, when she suddenly froze, grabbed my arm hard enough to leave marks, and whispered: “Eric. Something just moved. I’m not kidding.” While I didn’t see it, she claimed a shadow figure moved in one of the corners. 

I started to tease her (because tough-girl Ashley afraid of ghosts was hilarious), but she was pale as hell and actually shaking. Wrapped her up and kissed the top of her head. She hid her face in my chest the entire walk back upstairs.

The second we hit fresh air she started laughing at herself, but still wouldn’t let go of my hand until we were back in the truck. It wasn’t until then that told me she was going to get me for laughing. And she did. 

This date - while different and not the romantic type of the first - was every bit as amazing as it sounded while writing it. Every single thing we did together was like that. Amazing.

1puqapz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolanaLeveling/comments/1puqapz/tuyo_crypto_card_airdrop_points_referral_and/,"TUYO CRYPTO CARD: AIRDROP, POINTS + Referral And Invite Code","https://preview.redd.it/sv7s8lu8a69g1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=d607f02b7cd971943a838a8727eb774b0a1cd3b8

I know how frustrating it is to juggle three different apps just to pay for a coffee with your digital assets. One app for the wallet, another for the exchange, and a third for the card itself. That is why I have been spending a lot of time diving into the **Tuyo crypto card** and its ecosystem. It is refreshing to see a platform that actually understands the self-custodial dream while still giving us the convenience of a traditional bank.

# Tuyo Referral Code 

***If Your Looking For Tuyo Referral Code Use Referral code: “*****BOOST*****” To Boost Your Airdrop Points.***  
***Download:*** [https://get.tuyo.com/](https://get.tuyo.com/)

If you are looking for a way to spend your USDC natively on the Base network without giving up your private keys, you are in the right place. In this deep dive, I will break down how the **Tuyo card** works, the juicy details on the **points system**, and how you can position yourself for the potential **airdrop**.

# What Exactly Is the Tuyo Crypto Card?

https://preview.redd.it/hzuo2w4u969g1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbb5cfd84b8c38a220534b03e09bdfea04258c7b

The **Tuyo crypto card** is a self-custodial debit card that connects directly to the Tuyo finance app. Unlike traditional crypto cards where you have to top up a custodial account (essentially handing your money over to the company), Tuyo lets you keep control.

When you swipe the card at one of the 140 million plus merchants worldwide, the transaction happens natively. It uses USDC on the Base network and settles in local currency instantly. It is basically the bridge between your on-chain life and your off-chain expenses.

**Key Features at a Glance:**

* **Self-Custody First:** Your private keys stay on your device. No middlemen are holding your funds.
* **Base Network Integration:** Leveraging the speed and low cost of the Base L2.
* **Real Banking Features:** You get actual USD, EUR, and MXN account numbers in your name.
* **Global Reach:** Works anywhere Apple Pay or physical cards are accepted.

# Tuyo Card Review: The User Experience

From what I have gathered through community feedback and personal testing, the interface is where Tuyo really shines. Most crypto apps feel like they were designed by engineers for engineers. Tuyo feels like a high-end neobank.

The Setup Process

Getting started is surprisingly smooth. You download the app, set up your self-custodial wallet, and you can instantly generate a virtual card. This is a game changer for anyone who hates waiting two weeks for a piece of plastic to arrive in the mail. You can add it to Apple Pay and start spending within minutes.

Yield and Savings

One thing I love is the Earn feature. While your USDC sits in your account waiting to be spent, you can park it in vaults or staking protocols. Some users are reporting significantly higher yields than traditional savings accounts, which makes the card even more valuable. You aren't just spending; you are growing your capital until the moment of purchase.

# Understanding the Tuyo Points System

Now, let’s talk about the part everyone is excited about: **Tuyo Points**. In the current market, points are the currency of the future, often acting as a precursor to a token launch.

Tuyo has implemented a points-based loyalty program to reward active users. Instead of a flat cashback percentage in a random token, you accumulate points based on your activity within the app.

# How to Earn Tuyo Points

1. **Card Spending:** Every time you use your **Tuyo crypto card** for daily purchases, you earn points.
2. **Global Transfers:** Sending USDC to friends or family (which is free between Tuyo users) also contributes to your point tally.
3. **Yield Participation:** Utilizing the built-in staking and DeFi vaults helps you climb the leaderboard.
4. **Referrals:** Bringing new users into the borderless finance ecosystem is one of the fastest ways to boost your score.

The strategy here is simple: use Tuyo as your primary spending hub. The more volume you move through the card and the app, the more points you stack.

# The Tuyo Airdrop: Is It Coming?

The big question on everyone's mind is the **Tuyo airdrop**. While there is no official token contract live yet, the signs are all there. The crypto world has moved toward a Points to Tokens model, and Tuyo’s focus on account abstraction and mass adoption suggests a decentralized future.

How to Maximize Your Airdrop Eligibility

If you want to be ready for a potential drop, here is the path I am following:

* **Be an Early Adopter:** Get on the waitlist or download the app early. Early users are almost always rewarded more heavily.
* **Maintain On-Chain Activity:** Don't just let the app sit there. Make regular transactions, even small ones.
* **Use the Card Natively:** Since the card is a core product, spending via the **Tuyo crypto card** is likely a primary weight for any future distribution.
* **Hold a Balance:** Keeping a certain amount of USDC in your self-custodial vaults shows you are a long-term participant, not just a sybil looking for a quick buck.

# Fees and Limits: What Is the Catch?

No review is complete without looking at the costs. Tuyo is surprisingly aggressive with its fee structure.

|**Feature**|**Fee**|
|:-|:-|
|**Account Maintenance**|Free|
|**Virtual Card Issuance**|Free|
|**Transfers Between Users**|Free|
|**On-Chain Fees**|Minimal (Base Network Gas)|
|**FX Conversion**|Competitive Market Rates|

The main cost is the small gas fee required for on-chain transactions on the Base network, but since Base is an L2, these are usually just a few cents. This is a massive improvement over the high fees we used to see on Ethereum mainnet.

# Final Thoughts: Is Tuyo Worth It?

The **Tuyo crypto card** is perfect for the person who wants to be their own bank without the headache of manual bridging and complex DeFi interfaces. It bridges the gap between high-yield crypto savings and everyday real-world spending.

With the added incentive of the **Tuyo points** system, the risk to reward ratio looks very attractive. You get a top-tier financial tool and a potential ticket for a future airdrop just by doing your normal shopping.

Details regarding how he smoked in jail:
Police Interviews: While held in the Milwaukee County Jail, which had a no-smoking policy, Dahmer was allowed to smoke as many cigarettes as he liked during interviews with detectives at the Milwaukee Police Department administration building. One judge noted that Dahmer used his desire to ""talk some more"" as leverage to get cigarettes.
Special Privileges: News reports from the time indicated that Dahmer was at one point ""allowed to smoke"" in the jail, a privilege that other inmates were likely to protest. A sheriff's deputy noted that a judge had eased the jail's no-smoking rules specifically for Dahmer.
During Counsel Meetings: Dahmer also chain-smoked and drank coffee while meeting with his defense team, including lawyer Wendy Patrickus, in a small room to construct his defense strategy. 
After his sentencing and transfer to Columbia Correctional Institution, smoking rules likely varied by prison regulations at that time. Prison smoking policies were different in the early 1990s than they are today, often allowing smoking in certain areas or with specific rules.

I've been theorizing my next ginder setup as my current grinder is slowly degrading. I mostly make pour over coffee but I also have an flair 58 which I love to use from time to time. The big issue for me right now is the choice whether to buy 2 seperate grinders, one for filter and one for espresso, or to invest a little more into a single grinder. 
Contenders for the seperate grinders would be a fellow ode+ Eureka mignon totalling about 800 euro. The other option would be something like a 900euro varia vs6 which should be able to do both.

How are your experiences with single/dual grinder setups in these price ranges? Is the high end versitile grinder the obvious choice or am i better of buying 2 specialized grinders? Any grinder suggestions?

3. I use Mavuika to brute force Dire Stygian clears so even small gains are sometimes needed esp going for sub 180s on shilled bosses. 

4. I have C6 Iansan and SoS but currently have Iansan on overload team and SoS on Coffee for invested Skirk team. 

5. And finally the biggest one, ER tradeoffs. Given everything I mentioned above, bursting more consistently with Benny/Citlali is of course important but how much so if they both are at around 180-200ER. Don’t Nightsoul points do most of the work for Mav?

This guy would has driven everyone on the team insane. This is in a location of a well known coffee shop company(not starbucks, but almost as big, mentioning it bc there is an HR that is part of the story). This dude a massive loser with a gambling addiction, to the point of losing his apartment, car, even the electric scooter he got to replace the car. As result he was forced to move in with ex/mother of his child with the 3yo they share split custody. Even after all of that he lost even more money by betting on Jake Paul in the recent boxing match he was in. He’s been even worse since, probably because he bragged about betting on JP and everyone knows he lost all his money 

Listen - if he were remotely good at his job, I wouldn’t give a crap about his personal life or issues, not my problem. But he’s not even decent at his job. This guy makes a ridiculous amount of mistakes that never get fixed. Anytime anyone follows common procedure, “friendly reminders” in the groupchat, followed by photos, because he thinks anytime anyone points out his repetitive (and very stupid) mistakes, if theres no photos - that means we’re lying about him. He’s left a plastic containers on top of a rotating toaster multiple times, he said he’s incapable to handing separate tickets to the food and drink stations at the same time(they’re a foot apart), he’s no showed, he’s called out an hour before his shift and made up obvious lies, even yelled at other co workers IN FRONT of customers because they attempted to speak out against him.
Yet in over 5 years he has been there, no one will fire him. The one time an ex manager really tried he just said “No”, got the manager to flip out on him, recorded it on video and went to HR. As a result - no one will fire him, even though there are dozens of reasons he shouldn’t work here. 
What most recently ticked me off is him giving everyone COVID the past week, during the holidays, and only today on the 24th telling everyone thats what he’s had this entire time. Also REFUSED to wear a mask because he “can’t breathe”. 

This guy needs to get fired. Please guys I need help. Manager just wants us to accept his behavior, I just refuse. He’s a leech that takes up hours others could have and do thousands of times better. ",0,1766590881.0,UnethicalLifeProTips,0,0.25,False
1puq7by,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1puq7by/affair_with_subordinate/,Affair with subordinate,"My wife of 26 years is having an affair with a subordinate of her family business. She is a co-owner and he is a tech and her family run business. Her and her sisters own and run the business. She is almost 48, and he is 34 or 35.

I confronted her and she denied it at first. Then it shifted to ""it's none of your business"", to finally yes, I am ""talking to someone"", but it doesn't matter because in my head I am no longer married.

For clarity, maybe they have not been intimate yet, but they are texting and phoning each other for hours a day, having secret meetups, and obviously have the workplace to interact.  
  
I have photo and video evidence of him in my car with her; I caught them in a Cracker Barrel parking lot. 

We have not told the kids, or anyone, about this or the separation/divorce that is on deck.

She is stressed about the holidays since it's an emotional trigger, her dad died by suicide in December, and her mom from cancer. She is also experiencing conflict in her business over what she thinks is significant embezzlement by the other co-owners. Not excuses, just context.  


She is warm and cold with me, some days we kind of reconnect on small levels. For isnstance, she just callled me to tell me she was swing home on her way to the store (from breakfast with her sisters and my daughter) with coffee and bagels for me because she knew I was hungry. I don't get that... It confuses me.  


There were some issues 15 years ago that we dealt with, and about 3 months ago, we had a repeat of during a night of excessive drinking on vacation. 

She is framing that as a justification and reason. But then she pulls me aside and asks ne to sit down with her and tell her the details of my last therapy session, why should she care?

She did know that I had asked my therapist to focus on steps to ensure things like that don't repeat, but again, if she is done with the marriage and is actively cheating, why care? 

For the record, she refuses to acknowledge it as cheating and always comes back to ""We are just talking!""

Also, we had just scheduled a very expensive ($20k+) Disney trip for July, and even bought a ticket for one of my daughters friends to bring along. We also just (last week) purchased a new couch ($7k) and a new table and chairs ($6k).

Also, my 12 year od daughter has been having a lot of problems at public school, she is the victim in a title IX investigation, so we finally got her into a private school, which we won't be able to afford if we divorce.

My Daughter will be devasted by the seperation and loss of family, the lost Disney trip and the loss of the transition to private school next year.

I floated the idea of seperation instead, which she liked, but she wants me to live in the garage, while she gets the house. That seems unbalanced to me.

I wax and wane from wanting to try to salvage the marriage to wanting to blow up her spot at work and with her family. If I expose the photos/videos, he will be fired and she could be too.

If she would stop the interaction, things would be easier, even we divorce, but she is getting huge dopamine hits from this thing.

She told me that she likes him and he ""makes her feel good"" at a time when she hasn't for a long time.

She is also on the shot, and has dropped a bunch of weight and is looking great, not sure if that has anything to do with any of this.

What would you do?

Since so many gaslighters have been arguing recently that ""you are just bad converts wo never lived the True Faith (TM)"" I was thinking of sharing with you what authentic Orthodoxy looks like.

As a warning, I am a cynic, who likes to point out flaws around me.

1) After receiving the Eucharist, many parishioners bolt out of the church, making sure to make 3 large crosses as they exit the building to seal in their salvation. No reason to stick around the sinners still in the Communion line, their sins might be contagious.

Forget about coffee hour (there is no such concept in an authentic Orthodox church) or companionship, maybe just a short gossip in the courtyard as one is leaving the church.

2) Ran across some peculiar art on the walls of an Orthodox church. Faces of prominent Orthodox figures with tan (not golden) halos around the head.

Some of the recently canonized names had the halo repainted to gold. I am assuming that this is the short-list of people the priest is hoping to be canonized soon.

An important figure in this list was the former patriarch, who publicly supported the violent reaction of the Communist regime against the protesters in 1989 (which included shooting protesters with live ammo). 

Because against all the propaganda, Orthodoxy bishops in the 1980s (at least in some countries like Romania) enjoyed the fruits of Communism and preferred it over the ""filthy western secular democracy"". And even murder was appropriate to keep those priviledges.

3) In the days before Christmas, the priests visit the houses in the parish to announce Christmas and to give a quick blessing. But as laity, the most important part is to make sure to have the right amount of change at home because blessings don't come for free. The priest will not openly ask about the money, but people act like a generational curse will come down on the family if one doesn't pay the toll.

By my estimate, in urban areas the priest should make about a months worth of salary in one afternoon of blessings.

4) Now that it is the 24th, carol singers have been banging on the door once an hour, since the morning. It should be a joyous moment, but there is no such thing as a free carol, joy is only for those who pay.

So you end up locking the door and acting dead for the whole day to avoid the ""Christmas tax"".",5,1766590828.0,exorthodox,1,1.0,False

I've tried soooo many supplements (yes even the Mag), stool softeners , laxatives, 30g+ daily fiber from real food, fiber gummies, increased water intake, increased movement, coffee then HomeGoods, etc. I've had to do suppositories, enemas and a colonoscopy (just to be labeled with IBS, the constipation version lol) I was lucky if I had a bowel movement once a week, and even then it was pebbles. 

So I gave this combo a try and it worked within 24 hours. I even waited a few weeks to see if it was a fluke but it's not. I've had a bowel movement every day for the last 3 weeks 🙌 

Breakfast: 1 cup Plain Fiber One cereal topped with 1/2 cup of (ready to drink) Vanilla Muscle Milk protein as the milk - and I sprinkle cinnamon on top. 

I still walk about 10k steps a day and get my water in, but I had ALWAYS done that. Introducing that cereal combo as my breakfast has been a complete game changer for me. I know it's easy to be skeptical when you feel like you've tried it all but give it a try!

I know there is a lot to do in life, travel, explore, etc. But it doesnt seem like enough. I overthink a lot, and when I think sometimes about travelling, finding new people, and all of that, it seems like fun but something ill get bored of quickly. And no, I'm not saying it in the sense of ""I want to settle down"", thats the LAST thing I wanna do. I just think like, why isnt there more? More that I can look forward to? 

I genuinely dont know if this makes sense, because even as I am writing it, it doesnt feel like I'm saying exactly how i feel, but I dont know how. It just feels so small, everything feels too small. I don't know. I just feel like I want to KEEP doing things. Not just do something for a while, get the experience, then go to a monotone life. I want to keep having new experiences. But it just seems like there isnt that much to experience. 

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm just speaking from a place of inexperience and confusion.

I just want to do so much in my life. I want to get on a ship and sail through rocky waters. I want to climb a mountain and scale down the other side. I want to go to balls and parties and find people who have different outlooks on life. I want to be part of play that keeps travelling every week to be on new stages and entertain. I want to open a cafe that is also library on the upper floor, and when me and my best friend closes it in the evening we go to the terrace and drink coffee while looking out into city.

I have a broken espresso machine. My kiddo broke the carafe one more time than I was willing to replace. So I figured out my way to make coffee and have it brew directly into the cup. It’s not rocket science; it’s espresso. 

My wonderful, thoughtful and generous kiddo got me a new espresso machine for Christmas- basically the same one but not broken. 

The thought that horrified me was that I wanted to reject his gift (!!). What I have is not only good enough but that I prefer it because I have it brew into my hydroflask cup that stays warm and now I’ll dirty three dishes because I can’t put my favorite cup into the microwave. 

I will be very gracious about the gift and I will use it. I’ll bring my old machine to work. 

On one hand, I see that I don’t need stuff to be happy. I don’t need a new machine and the oneI have is perfect for my needs. On the other hand, I don’t want to be an ungrateful jerk to my kiddo who gave me a thoughtful gift. Pre-perimenopause I don’t think that thought would have even formed. I would have only focused on the kindness and finding a happy home for the older machine would have been second nature. 

My older relatives were like this and would be angry at the thought of change. That’s my new instinct and yuck, I don’t like it. I don’t want to be hurtful like they were. 

Anyone else?

I will be changing the lamp to a fenton glass lamp when I find one I like. I have one I love but keep it in my room. It is too priceless to me to have out and at risk to be broken. 

TV is too high but this is what works best for the furniture I have. It keeps the space the most open, and navigable to get in/ out without being cramped or blocking someone's view/ making them have to move. 

I tried 2 other lay outs prior to this. I wanted to set my TV up on the large wall to take up that space but both layouts I tried this way just made no sense. 

I may add some smaller end tables later, im currently shopping for a set of throw blankets that I like, I have a nice hand carved center piece coming in for my coffee table. (I may end up using it as a fruit bowl and picking something else for the center piece). 

The house is already wired to have a ceiling fan. So I will be swapping out the center light at some point. 

The kitchen counter space I have a photo on which is out of view. I will likely be putting the fruit bowl there as well. And maybe 1-2 more photos and then adding some bar stools

I would love suggestions on more than just decorating ideas. Stuff like comforter sets, bathroom sets, cleaning products, or anything you have in your home that you really enjoy.

1pupwf1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pupwf1,Cempedak Private Island,"Cempedak Private Island is a small adults-only eco-luxe resort located off the coast of Bintan Island, a large Indonesian island just to the south of Singapore. My wife and I visited after spending a few days in Singapore prior.

Clientele seemed mostly to be Singaporean or British couples, and most stayed for a few days, though we stayed for 8 and we got a few minor benefits for a longer stay, though none were advertised when we booked.

After booking, the resort sent us a “before you go” guide which was very helpful in knowing what/how much to pack, the best way to get an Indonesian visa, and some information about their charitable foundation educating local children.

**Getting There**
Most guests arrive at Cempedak via the Tanah Merah ferry terminal in Singapore, though it’s also reachable by ferry from Malaysia, or flight from Jakarta.

The full travel to the resort consists of the 1 hour public ferry to Bintan island, expedited immigration into Indonesia, a 30 minute drive to Cempedak’s jetty and a short speedboat trip to the hotel.

Upon arrival we were taken immediately to the restaurant for lunch, and checked in while we waited for our food.

**Food and Drink**
Cempedak charges $100SGD (c. $78USD) per person per day, for three meals, drinking water, tea and coffee. Food is largely local, Indonesian cuisine and designed in alignment with The Long Run, an organisation promoting sustainable tourism, and as such is a set menu, using mostly local ingredients, many of which are grown on the hotel’s farm.

The set menu is posted in the restaurant each morning - if you don’t like what’s scheduled for lunch or dinner the team are happy to accommodate and will suggest alternatives .

If you like Indonesian food, you’ll find much to enjoy, though I didn’t go too far “off menu” so I’m not certain how well they accommodate any real “out there” suggestions.

Food was always tasty and enjoyable. Well presented, flavourful, but not necessarily memorably good. But for the daily cost, it seemed very reasonable.

Aside from the restaurant, the resort also has a pretty great bar that makes good cocktails and beautiful sunsets, though at certain times we found ourselves assailed by tiny flies.

**The Rooms**
Cempedak offers two categories of room - beach villas with direct access to the beach, and sea view villas with great views of the sea and nearby islands. Both come with sizeable pools, large sun-decks and a lot of space - around 150sqm across two floors.

Villas are designed sympathetically to the local environment and are built primarily from bamboo. They look incredible, they’re super private, and everything faces the sea, encouraging you to enjoy the views at all times while never being overlooked.

One thing to be aware of though - the villas are fully open to the elements, and that means (1) no air conditioning and (2) bugs. 

**No air con**
This is part of the eco mission of the hotel, but it means you rarely get respite from the tropical heat. As a result, we used our private pool to cool off.

Many of the reviews of this place we’ve seen said that sea breezes meant air conditioning simply wasn’t needed. In our experience this wasn’t the case. We were told by staff that breezes can be seasonal and while we were there (March) it was very still. The rooms have ceiling fans which help a little, but not much!

Because of this, we were particularly hot at night. The hotel gladly supplied us with a pedestal fan each, but at high humidity and temperatures around 32 celsius (91 Fahrenheit), sleeping wasn’t always the easiest. This was a pity because the bed was huge and comfy.

**Bugs**
You’re staying in an ancient rainforest in a room with no wall or windows. While you’re secure from people (the only access to the room is your locked door), flying insects can and do enter the room. Once it’s dark I recommend switching off all your lights to avoid bugs zeroing in on the light. Your bed comes with a mosquito net so you’re safe from them while you sleep - you just have to accept that you’re genuinely a part of nature while you’re here.

**Service**
Cempedak only hires locals for its staff, but they do a full training program for every staff member. While you don’t get truly elite service, every single member of staff seemed proud of their jobs, happy, friendly and competent. We were always warmly greeted whenever encountering staff, and we were recognised by face and name after the first day or so. It’s a small resort (20 rooms), and because we had a relatively long stay we felt really welcome as we chatted to people day by day.

We were provided with an IPad for our villa where we were given information about upcoming activities and could also make requests which were acted upon promptly. 

**Things to do**
It’s a small resort, so there aren’t a ton of activities, but Cempedak definitely offers a good selection. We kayaked round the island, played tennis on the beautiful lawn tennis court, enjoyed a guided nature walk on the island, and of course spent a lot of time in the sea and pools. The spa is in a beautiful location on rocks by the sea, and we enjoyed our very peaceful treatments there. The island offers some snorkelling from the jetty but better coral as part of a paid boat trip. We don’t sail or windsurf, but sail boats/windsurfing equipment are hireable.

**Summing up**
Cempedak was a truly memorable stay, but my feelings are a little split. I truly felt charmed by the place - the magical views, the expansive room, pool and terrace, the immersion into nature, the local cuisine and friendly staff.

But would I go back? I’m not sure. Genuinely, the heat at night meant I was just never comfortable sleeping, and that’s a big thing for me. If you can sleep just fine in the heat, I don’t think you’d be bothered, but from someone used to cold weather it was tough!

she still decided to fire me because for a couple minutes i ran out of something, ridiculous.

anyways, when i left he said, ""i'm really sorry mike"" and it felt so sincere.

My suggestion of increasing our wages is usually met with an annoyed glare from my boss.

Management's latest innovative idea was to force everyone to bring in their ugliest Christmas sweaters and the winner would get a free coffee.

Unsurprisingly this event was on a weekend and made it clear that attendance was mandatory and we wouldn't get paid for our time.

I showed up with the cheapest sweater I could find which was just a picture of a nutcracker with the words “deez nuts” emblazoned on it. My manager told me to take it off as it was inappropriate, and I happily obliged.

I was sitting in a corner drinking a beer and trying not to be noticed when I heard the first scream.

My attention was drawn to an intern who was wearing a snowman sweater. She was letting out a shriek as her feet were turning to ice. We all stood in shock as inch by inch the ice crept up her body.

My manager Doug rushed over to help but tripped over his own feet and collided with her. Her screams were cut off as her body fell to the floor and shattered into dozens of tiny pieces. 

Pandemonium ensued as everyone rushed to the doors to find them barred shut. 

Doug desperately tried to calm everyone down, but his efforts lasted less than a minute. I was the first to notice the first piece of flesh that slid off his body and sank to the floor. He was so engrossed in speaking that he didn't realise until half his arm was gone, leaving nothing but his bone behind.

He began panicking and trying to pick up his flesh and force it back onto his arm but it was no use. I winced as his eyeballs dropped from his skull, and almost vomited when he unintentionally crushed them beneath his feet.

He mumbled the words “shit on it”, moments before his internal organs dropped from beneath his Jack Skellington sweater and he sank dead to the floor.

Two of my coworkers who were wearing matching sweaters, began convulsing as branches began emerging from every orifice. Their eyeballs and organs soon decorated what can only be described as the most macabre Christmas trees I had ever seen.

Within five minutes it was only me and another coworker Emily left alive. We were surrounded by the bloodied remains of the people we used to spend most of our day with. 

Emily turned to me with a relieved look and said “I think it is over”. The words had barely left her mouth before steam before emanating from her ears.

I rushed over and grabbed the punch bowl and flung it over her, but it was of no use.

She was opening her mouth to speak but no words came out, while I could see flames slowly crawling up her throat.

She gave me a weary smile before dropping to her knees, and turning into a pile of ash that lay atop a sweater showing a fireplace.

I gazed over at the sweater that I had been forced to remove and checked that my testicles were still in one piece.

1pupuos,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1pupuos/thoughts_on_purpose/,Thoughts on Purpose,"I suspect many of us have an instrumental way of thinking. We view everything systematically, as inputs to a process producing desired outputs. In other words, as a means to an end. This approach is broadly useful, but it can lead to an existential problem.

When applied rigorously, it strips away delusion, eliminating religion, ideology, and passive acceptance of societal values. This creates a void  you can't rationally fill, and it diminishes motivation. You're left with a constant dull ache of irritation and melancholy, interspersed with occasional flashes of intensity. But you refuse to engage in self-delusion, so the feeling persists.

Consider the root cause again: our instrumental way of thinking. ""Everything serves a purpose."" Is it delusional to view something as valuable for its own sake? Does rationality require that it be useful, or is that view no less arbitrary? In other words, does life need a purpose?

I stopped taking testosterone for a couple of years because of it, though my symptoms remained manageable but certainly noticeable. I recently in the last two months re-started testosterone but this time I have a couple year’s worth of figuring out what impacts the severity of my symptoms, and I’ve been having an easier time this go around.

I thought I would share in case it could help anyone or if anyone relates:

The biggest things that impact the severity of my stiffness are: sleep, hydration, and eating.

Secondary things that seem to have a noticeable affect: stress, caffeine, workouts(when I do a full workout my muscles are “warmed up” during it but I become a stone statue after)

If I can get a full nights sleep, stay hydrated, and remember to eat regularly, my symptoms are dramatically better. If I sleep poorly I am the tin man. If I sleep poorly, rely on caffeine, and forget to eat most of the day, there’s no hope for me.

I’ve seen many people on here mention potassium impacting their symptoms, but for me I haven’t found this to be true. I often drink coconut water to help hydrate and this has only ever helped ease my stiffness. 

I recently had a couple weeks of bad stiffness, but the last few days I’ve avoided coffee and opted for lower caffeine tea and have noticed a big difference. Sometimes I’ll notice a change in stiffness within ten minutes of drinking coffee, it’s crazy. ",2,1766589839.0,MyotoniaCongenita,3,1.0,False

Bit of a Christmas-season question.

I’m (24 M) in Bangalore right now and most of my close friends have gone home to Kerala, so the city’s feeling unusually quiet. I’ve been wanting to watch Sarvam Maaya, and I figured I’d ask here instead of just going alone and doom-scrolling after 😅

If anyone in Bangalore was already planning to watch it, or is in the same boat this Christmas and doesn’t mind some company, let me know. Totally casual. No pressure. Just a movie and maybe a coffee after if the vibe’s right.

Sometimes the best plans come from asking strangers on Reddit, right?

We stayed in contact, since, but everytime I mentioned meeting up, there was always a reason she couldn’t meet up. Two weeks ago, we had plans to meet up. She said she couldn’t wait to see me. Literally the day of, she canceled on me. She said she had to help out her cousin. I called her later that night at 7 and sent a text……no response. She then messaged me at midnight saying she was asleep. We have literally been in contact via text only, since September. I called her out and told her to just tell me if she seeing other guys or dating someone new. When I did that she got upset and annoyed and said she’s not seeing any other guys and that she’s just focused on her daughter and wants to be alone. Sidenote, I’ve also noticed, since September, she stopped going to the coffee shop both of us would go to. I feel she stopped going because she doesn’t want to see me. 

What do you suppose is going on? Why does she continue to text me and show interest by flirting and claim she wants me….but never meets?

I’d like to stay in the $1000 budget, but expect to have this a while and don’t want to be too penny wise.

Expected usage / needs

\- 1-2lbs per week (ideally 1/2-1+ pound per batch)

\- primarily medium-darker espresso roasts

\- relatively easy to use

\- relatively easy to move/store for the week

\- high consistency of roast (once dialed in, easy to get the same output. Eg not doing a ton of different coffee once I find something I enjoy)

\- electric, not 220V

No online shopping.

No snacks outside.

No unnecessary expenses.

First win: I walked to work instead of taking an auto. Saved ₹60. Felt like Warren Buffett.

On the way, I saw a sign: “Tea – ₹10”

I thought, One tea won’t ruin my budget.

It did not.

Then came the biscuit. ₹10.

Then another tea because “the first one was just warming up.” ₹10.

Then samosa. ₹20.

Then another samosa because eating one alone feels emotionally incomplete. ₹20.

At this point I had spent ₹70 but mentally I was still “saving money”.

Later, my phone slipped from my pocket.

Not dramatically.

Not in slow motion.

Just a soft tap on the ground.

Screen went black.

Repair guy looked at the phone, looked at me, and said,

“Brother… better you didn’t save money today.

₹1,200.

While waiting, I bought a coffee because I was stressed. ₹120.

On the way home, I finally took an auto. ₹60.

Total expenses while trying to save money: ₹1,450

Lesson learned:

When I don’t try to save money, my phone survives.

When I do try to save money, the universe notices and charges interest.

Tomorrow I will try to save time instead.

If I disappear, you know why.

I had actually known him from Tinder before that, but it didn't go anywhere because I was out of the country for a few weeks. When I got back in July, we matched again and everything seemed to go smoothly—or so I thought. He texted me every day and we talked constantly. When we finally met up at his house, we were having a glass of wine and he suddenly started saying how he’s not looking for anything serious. I was so confused because we met on a dating app where he specifically said he was not looking for hookups. I didn't say anything in the moment, and some things happened that night. I stayed over and it was honestly one of the most romantic nights of my life to date.

We met again a few days later and the same thing happened, but I started noticing a major shift in his attitude. He wouldn’t even ask if I got home safe. I would be leaving his place at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning in a part of town that isn't safe, and he couldn't be bothered to check in. To me, even if it's just FWB, shouldn't there be some ""friendship"" and basic care involved? After that, a few weeks went by without a single text. I knew it was done because the last few times I was the one initiating everything. We eventually talked again after he replied to one of my stories, and I confronted him about the ghosting and leaving me on read. He just claimed he was ""working"" and told me it was all in my head. I want to note that, because every single time I voiced a concern or told him something was bothering me, he would try to psychoanalyze it and tell me I was imagining things.

Another week goes by and he hits me up to meet again. I don't know why I did it, but I’ve been feeling so lonely since I moved to this new city away from everyone I know, and I think that influenced my decision. He was very kind to me this time, almost like a puppy—he doesn't think of me when I'm not there, but he's happy when I am. He always claims to be working, but then I see his stories and he's constantly out drinking wine and coffee with friends. Later on, while we were talking, he actually ""called me out"" for not wanting to go all the way with penetration. I told him straight up that I don’t do that unless I’m somewhat emotionally connected to someone. He already knew this because he had literally asked me in the middle of making out previously and I told him then, too.

I defended myself by saying I didn't feel safe doing that because I didn't think I was the only person he was seeing. I had seen him on Tinder updating his pictures and bio often, even while we were together. He claimed he was only on there ""to talk,"" which felt like a lie since he barely even talks to me when I text him. I told him I wanted to stop seeing each other if he was seeing other people because I didn't feel safe health-wise not knowing who else he was with. He promised he would tell me if he saw someone else, so I stopped worrying for a moment. But then, we went an entire month without talking—no texts, no story replies, just complete silence. I was getting so annoyed and confused that I decided to see who he was following. He had followed about 20 new people from Tinder and Grindr in our local community. How can he convince me I’m the only one he sees when he’s following that many new guys right after we met? There is no way they haven't met up. I feel like he's been lying to my face and making me feel crazy for having basic intuition.

TL;DR: I’ve been seeing a guy who tells me my concerns are ""all in my head"" and insists he isn't seeing anyone else, even though he's constantly active on Tinder. After a month of silence, I found out he followed 20+ new local guys from dating apps. I’m struggling with the gaslighting",1,1766589158.0,relationships,10,0.67,False

I was hoping I’d have another idea by now but unfortunately I do not. I’d like it to be something I can pick up in a store today so her bag doesn’t seem so sad (since the makeup items are small). For reference, here’s a little bit about her:

- does pilates and yoga classes frequently
- likes to make matcha and coffee at home
- is on the crunchier side 
- is a photographer 
- is a dancer and dance teacher 
- she loves to read, especially young adult or fantasy books that are NOT spicy

when we hang out, its usually one one one. sometimes we hang out in a group (usually with my friends, not with their friends as much) but the majority of our hangouts are just us and we often go out to a cafe, diner, or hang out outside

they often try to pay for my stuff and have and for it several times like my coffee or food

we talk about a lot of personal stuff, and our conversations last for ours on end without running out of things to talk about. we advise each other about our problems, its usually been me who goes to them for advice but recently they asked me for advice about stuff they were dealing with too 

they also talk to me about their interests a lot even though i know that they are kind of embarrassed to tell people about their interests sometimes

when they went on vacation, they got me a souvenir, and they also got me a gift for my birthday and wrote a card with it, and then they got me a christmas gift as well 

they have offered to do favors for me like sending me an uber, helping me move my stuff, or helping me write an essay

i noticed that one time when i had an issue that they didn't know much about, they talked to their sister about it and came back to me with advice. also i briefly met their mom once, and she said she had heard about me 

one negative sign is that there is not a lot of physical contact. we often hug goodbye after we hang out, but its just a brief hug, and i hug all of my friends and have honestly more physical contact with some of my other friends than them. that being said they often avoid physical contact with people in general. once one of our other friends asked for a hug and they said ""how about a pat on the shoulder instead"" and in group hangouts they avoid sitting on the couch and choose a chair instead, presumably to avoid physical contact with others on the couch. recently i was hanging out with them and i initiated physical contact by having my knee kind of touch their knee while we were on the couch and they did not move it but that also could have just been bc it can be seen as rude to move it.

And it came out way better but I’m wondering if I should adjust my grind courser to make my base recipe. I plan on trying it for my next brew and going maybe 55-60 clicks.

Now at work negligible women colleagues, dating apps don't work. So in short I never had even considerable women around me who could notice me and maybe I can approach them.

There are other offices around my office where girls are there I mean they roam around in common open area, is it a good thing to randomly strike a hello Convo and introduce myself politely, but then since I never talked what should be the way to stay in touch, no it's not possible to see the same girl again because people don't roam at fixed times, it's monotonous, so should I approach them directly and ask for a coffee or ask for their number and what to talk about?, is it considered creep if I do this being non pushy and politely?

Also apart from it I don't think I got an option, dear ladies please tell where else can I approach politely and in a respectful manner and ask for a date maybe.

Always asking for pictures of me, what I was wearing, saying he wanted to see it all, that he couldn’t get enough.

I did start to notice a slowdown maybe in the morning texts and his initiating the week after Thanksgiving. I asked him if anything was wrong and he assured me it was not, just busy at work since he just returned. He always said he doesn’t play games, what a straight shooter he is, etc.

We slept together on a Thursday for the first time. We had a date planned for that Saturday. And that’s when it all fell apart. We bickered all through dinner. It was weird. Neither of us could pinpoint what the problem was. I kept telling him I never argue with people, so I didn’t want to argue. We kept trying to right the dinner back into place but it kept going off track and over nothing. I at one point asked him if he was doing it on purpose. At the end of dinner he said it was best if he both went back to our own homes and talked in the morning. I was stunned.

He called me on my way home to ask if I had gotten home safely and I was snappy with him. I said it was absurd that he would let a dumb argument get in the way of us having sleeping together, or something along those lines. The cab driver assured me it would be fine since we were sleeping together (thank you cab driver).

The next day when I didn’t hear from him, I texted him. Asked him for coffee. He said he had work but maybe mid week or we could talk later. I could tell something was off. I called and texted later. I got silence from him for the first time ever. I texted the next morning. He didn’t respond to lunch. Apologized said he would call me that night. I texted him that evening and he said he was still in the office. It went on like that for a week. Kept saying he would call and didn’t. I finally got him on the phone around midnight on Sunday. He was defensive, on guard. I asked him if he still wanted to be with me and he kept saying “I don’t know” “I haven’t had time to process the dinner yet” because he had worked a 100 hour work week. He said he wasn’t sure if we were compatible long term, that I seem to want more than he can give, and thought we might have slept together too soon. When I asked about the not speaking to me, not even texting me throughout the week he got defensive: “make me the bad guy the villain. I fucked up okay?” But let me be very clear here: he did not end things on this call.

At this point I had been very calm up until the last few days when my texts started to escalate. After this call he said he would text me the next day (Monday) bc I made it very clear like: where do we go from here? and I said he could wait a couple days till things cleared up at work.

Wednesday afternoon I sent him an easy going text asking how the deal went and if he wanted to grab a drink or coffee before we left for the holidays. Thursday evening he responded normally, asking me how I was doing twice and saying he was out of gas and he just got home. I texted him a couple hours later with some pictures from a party I went to and some condolences and to let me know if he wanted to grab a drink on Friday. Friday morning he hearted the pictures and the text. Nothing else came.

I believe he was traveling Saturday but I couldn’t be sure. Saturday I sent him a text asking if he still wanted to put his energy towards this and if I should. That that’s the most important thing and we’ll just go from there. I said I didn’t want to presume where his head was at. That I know he prides himself on being a straight shooter.

No response. I sent him a text Saturday night asking him if he was slow ghosting me, and if he would prefer if I just stopped contacting him. No response.

I have texted him Sunday, Monday and today in hopes of getting some response from him and I am officially getting ghosted.

How can a middle-aged man with children and a high-powered job ghost a woman with a high-powered job who he spoke to everyday? And is he really planning on never speaking to me again? We could easily run into each other. Why doesn’t he just send me one sentence that it’s over. I have sent him so many opportunities to.",4,1766588693.0,BreakUps,16,0.83,False

# Ayla was in the hospital when the doctor spoke to her in a flat voice. 



# “Ms. Keaton, this miscarriage caused serious damage. Your chances of having children again are very low. You need to mentally prepare yourself.” 



# Her mind buzzed. 



# She had worked for three years to get pregnant. Finally, two months ago, she had succeeded. 



# And now, this afternoon, a car had darted out of nowhere, knocking her down. 



# The doctor frowned. “Ms. Keaton?” 



# “Alright, I understand. Thank you, Doctor.” 



# Ayla didn’t like showing weakness in front of others. She blinked quickly, forcing back her tears, then stood up and walked out. 



# Behind her, she caught the whispers of two nurses. “Something this serious happened to her, and her husband never showed up?” 



# “Don’t even mention it. Right after her procedure, she cried so hard she almost passed out and begged him to come. He never showed.” 



# “Oh my gosh. If that isn’t a sign he doesn’t love her, then what is? If this doesn’t end in divorce, I’ll be shocked.” 



# Ayla walked farther away and missed the rest of their conversation. 



# The truth was, not only did Troy refuse to come, but he had also snapped at her over the phone. “The baby’s gone, so what? Stop crying about it. I’m busy. Stop bothering me.” 



# After that, every call she made went unanswered. 



# For three years, Troy had always treated her this way–cold and distant. 



# The truth was she had grown used to it.

# The marriage had only happened because three years ago Ayla had accidentally saved Troy’s grandfather, Martin Winston’s life. Martin liked her and pushed for the match. Without him, she would have never married Troy. 



# From the start, Troy never wanted her. 



# Still, today she kept calling him, hoping he might care for the sake of their unborn child. 



# Clearly, she had hoped for too much. 



# Shaking off the thought, Ayla pulled out her phone to call a cab. Just then, a message popped 



# up. 

# It was from Max Bennett, Troy’s best friend. He had sent her a video. 



# She clicked on it. 



# The first shot was of an enormous bouquet of roses–at least 999 of them. There were so many flowers, the frame couldn’t hold them all. 



# Then the camera shifted left. Troy appeared, standing beside a woman. 



# Skyla Summer. 



# Ayla’s pupils tightened. Her fingers gripped hard around her phone. 



# In the video, voices rose with excitement. “Skyla, Troy knew you were coming back to the country today. He’s been planning this welcome party for weeks! He really went all out. 



# “Come on, give him a hug to thank him!” 



# “A hug? Please, just kiss already. It’s not like you two haven’t done it before. I still have that video of your three–minute intense kiss.” 



# Skyla shook her head with a smile. “Not anymore; it’s not appropriate.” 



# Before she could finish, Troy pulled her into his arms. “Skyla, welcome back.” 



# He held her so naturally, so gently, it made the whole crowd scream. 



# The crowd screamed and cheered. “See? He doesn’t care one bit!” 



# “Kiss! Kiss!”

# When Ayla got home, she started to pack her suitcase. 



# Over the years, her life had been simple–work, routine, nothing fancy. She rarely bought anything for herself. Other than clothes and important documents, there wasn’t much to take. A single 26–inch suitcase was enough. 



# In less than 30 minutes, everything was ready. 



# Then she waited for Troy to come home. 



# It was two in the morning when the front door was pushed open. 



# Troy walked through the living room and met her eyes.

# “I was waiting for you.”

# Troy’s gaze shifted to the suitcase by her side. He seemed to understand immediately. “You saw Max’s video, didn’t you?”

# Troy frowned. “Stay tonight.” 



# “No.” Ayla grabbed her luggage and walked out.

# Then the front door shut.

# Max was shocked. “What? Divorced? Over a video? No way! Ayla wouldn’t leave you. If she really did, I’ll eat my hat!” 



# “I’m the one who brought that up,” Troy said. 



# Max went quiet. 



# Everyone knew when Troy brought up divorce, it didn’t mean much. Ayla was famous for clinging to him like glue–he could never shake her off.

I'm still a new EHS and I just took over a cafe that has a lot of...well, interesting ingredients. The Operator is really into tendy health fads. Everything on the menu is a tonic, potion, or elixir, if that gives you any idea of what kind of place this is. 

I'm trying to figure out how much, if any, of his business model is actually safe/within regs, because I don't think the person before me looked at it too hard. 

He has a variety of mushroom extracts (lion's mane) from local producers, mushroom tea/coffee, supplements (ashwaganda, etc), etc. which I know are no-goes.  He used to have CBD stuff but that was shut down, and now he wants to get into terpene beverages. 

I've been digging through 21 CFR 170 (and other sections) and the GRAS notices but it's honestly hard to parse. Plus I don't actually understand the rules for supplements in food. Is a supplement ok in food if it's GRAS (like whey protein)? Is it only GRAS if the FDA letter has no questions? Does it matter if it has a nutrition label vs a supplement label? Is there an easier way to do all this? ",4,1766588590.0,healthinspector,7,1.0,False

I always thought memories were linear. From yesterday, to today, to tomorrow—lined up like people waiting for a bus.

It wasn’t until that moment that I understood—

Some memories fall on you *backwards*.

From a “very long time ago’s tomorrow,” smashing down all at once.

When Silent Man said that line, the store was very quiet.

“...It’s something you and I failed to finish, a thousand years ago.”

His voice wasn’t loud, but it felt like someone fired a gun right next to my ear.

I stood there in a daze.

My throat was so dry I couldn’t speak.

A thousand years ago. Together. Something unfinished.

Those three fragments nailed themselves into my skull, and the next second, it felt like the color drained one step out of the world.

The sound of the AC moved into the distance. The hum of the fridge sounded like it was in another room.

I stared at him and suddenly felt—

The person in front of me wasn’t just “Silent Man.”

“Are you… *sure*…” I forced my voice out. “This isn’t some… really screwed-up joke?”

He pressed his lips together and didn’t answer. He only reached out and grabbed the edge of the counter, like that old piece of wood was the only thing keeping him upright.

His knuckles turned white. His fingernails dug into the scratches in the wood.

That wasn’t the posture of someone about to lie. It was the posture of someone about to be sentenced.

I drew in a breath, but my chest felt tighter.

My heart was beating too fast.

“...Fine,” I said quietly. “Then explain. What do you mean, ‘a thousand years ago’?”

The second that question left my mouth, I knew I’d regret it.

Because what flashed through his eyes wasn’t a desire to talk—

It was the desire to *run*.

“I…” His Adam’s apple bobbed. “I don’t remember everything either.”

“Then you—”

Before I could finish, a sharp pain exploded between my brows.

Like someone slammed a blunt object into the back of my head.

The world tilted.

The shelves, the register, the fridges, his face—all of it stretched into a single line and got sucked into some black hole.

I didn’t have time to grab anything. My vision went white.

Not light-white. Colder than that.

And then—

The memories came crashing down.

**\[Memory Fragment I: Land of Wei Flowers\]**

The first thing I feel is the wind.

It’s freezing.

It rushes in from every direction, cold enough to strip skin. It carries ash, blood, tree sap, and a smell I can’t place—half flower, half rot.

My vision slowly focuses.

There’s a field of Wei flowers under me—

Thicker and crazier than the ones I saw in the Rose Court.

Their petals aren’t dark purple, but almost pure white, their edges tinged with the thinnest red.

When the wind blows, the mass of Wei flowers bow and rise again, like they’re nodding to someone, or seeing someone off.

The ground is wet.

Not from rain.

From blood.

I’m lying in it.

My back is pressed into the cold soil. With every breath, my body feels like it’s tearing open a new wound.

There’s a sweetness in my throat.

The kind that makes your body want to retch.

I try to lift my hand.

My wrist feels numb, like it doesn’t belong to me.

But when my fingertips touch the air, the familiarity comes back all at once—

This isn’t the first time.

…No.

This time is the last time.

Someone is calling me.

A voice that’s far away and right beside me at the same time.

“...Don’t sleep.”

“...Look at me.”

His voice is shaking, like he’s just been thrown into ice water.

I blink hard. The world pulls itself together.

A face fills my vision.

Not entirely clear, as if covered in fog—

But the outline is familiar.

A straight nose. Deep-set eyes. Wet lashes, I don’t know whether from rain or tears.

His long hair is sticky with blood, plastered against his face and collarbone.

He’s kneeling in the Wei flowers, holding me.

Both his knees are buried deep in blood and mud. Below the knees I can’t even tell what color anything used to be.

His arms are shaking from how tightly he’s clutching me, like he’s afraid that if he loosens his grip even a little, I’ll spill through his fingers like sand.

“Look at me.”

He presses his forehead to mine, his voice forced low.

“Don’t close your eyes.”

He’s crying.

Not the heaving sobs kind of crying, but the kind where the tears are being held back so hard they break through anyway.

I can feel how uneven his breathing is. His chest rises and falls violently. His heartbeat is slamming against my bones.

“...Why are you crying?” I hear myself say.

My voice is very soft—soft like someone else is speaking for me.

“Shut up,” he chokes out.

“Don’t talk.”

I take a breath. The sweetness in my throat thickens.

It feels like someone is scraping the inside of my lungs with a knife, slowly.

“It’s fine.” I force a tiny smile.

“Anyway…”

He suddenly shakes his head, hard, like a child refusing something.

“No.”

His fingers dig deeper into my shoulder, as if he can keep me from being taken away just by holding tighter.

“Don’t use the Mark again…” His voice is trembling. “I’m begging you…”

He breaks off halfway, like he’s swallowed something down.

I drag my gaze past his shoulder.

In the distance, the light is still burning.

There is only one color in the whole sky—white, burned-out gray.

That’s the Rose battlefield.

That’s what I tore open with my own hands.

“...It’s already too late,” I whisper.

He doesn’t reply.

His shoulders shake harder.

It’s still the same unsaid plea:

*Don’t.*

I feel tired.

My body and my head both have this weird weightless feeling, like in one more second the wind will carry me away completely.

Normally, people should be terrified right now, right?

Afraid of pain, afraid of death, afraid of disappearing.

But my emotions are… calm.

Much calmer than his.

“You’re crying,” I say, and lift my hand.

It feels like there’s water between me and my arm; the movement lags half a beat.

Blood is caked dry and fresh between my fingers and up my forearm.

But I still manage to raise it.

With that bloodstained hand, I touch his face.

He stiffens.

My fingertips brush his cheek.

It’s wet.

Not rain. Tears.

He closes his eyes for a second, like he’s been pierced.

“Don’t cry,” I murmur.

This time, I’m more serious than I’ve ever been, asking him for something:

“...I don’t want you to still be crying a thousand years from now.”

His lashes tremble. For a second, the light in his eyes shatters.

“A thousand…” His voice claws out of his throat. “Why are you saying—”

I don’t hear the rest.

Because my chest suddenly seizes.

Not the tightness of a heart cramp— but the weight of the whole world dropping onto my heart in one go.

I can feel something warm running out of the corner of my mouth.

He fumbles to wipe it away, then stops halfway, visibly shocked.

His hand is shaking.

His fingertips are coated in my blood.

Wei flowers snap around us, one by one. Their petals soak red.

Far away, the light rips through the tree line, like it’s going to swallow the entire world.

“Hey.” I really want to laugh, but no air comes up my throat. I can only use my eyes to look for his face.

“Look at me.”

He forces himself to lower his head.

With the last bit of strength I have, I lift my fingers to the space between his brows.

“Like this…” I mumble. “Even if you forget…”

My fingertips are ice. His skin is burning.

“...you’ll still know that you once cried for me.”

He shuts his eyes.

He can’t hold back anymore. Tears fall, one by one, onto the back of my hand.

“Don’t—”

His voice finally tears out of him, almost a scream.

“I don’t want this.”

I want to say something, but nothing comes out.

The world begins to lose focus.

His face stretches, distorts, pulls away—until all that’s left are those eyes, wet with light.

The last thing I see is—

He bites down on his own lips hard enough to draw blood.

His arms clamp around me. His whole body kneels in the sea of Wei flowers like a giant tree that’s been broken in half.

Then everything is swallowed by white.

**\[Reality\]**

“—Don’t cry.”

I hear myself say it.

By the time I realize it’s me talking, the words are already out of my mouth.

Not in the dream.

In the convenience store.

The hand I’ve reached out—

Is resting on Silent Man’s face.

His eyes widen.

The position we’re in is ridiculous and strange:

He’s half-crouched in front of me, one hand gripping the counter, the other bracing my shoulder that’s about to give out;

and I’m slumped forward, practically in his arms, fingers trembling against the side of his face.

For a heartbeat, the dream and reality overlap.

Wei flowers, blood, tears, and cold wind—

Collide with the white light of the store.

I gasp like I’ve just broken the surface of a lake.

“...Don’t cry.”

My voice is very soft, but clearer than in the dream.

He freezes, staring at me.

His eyes aren’t wet.

At least, not on the surface.

But I can feel his breathing is off.

His Adam’s apple moves hard, like he’s forcing something down.

“I’m not crying.” He forces his voice to stay calm. “What are you talking about?”

“...Sorry.” I slowly let my hand drop. My fingertips are numb. Once I loosen my arm, it feels like someone cut a string.

“I, I just…”

The aftershock of the memory fragment is still there.

My chest feels tight; there’s a faint sweetness in my throat.

I look down at my hand.

My palm is clean.

No Mark of Wei. No blood.

Just a slight tremor.

Silent Man stares at my hand for a few seconds, like he’s confirming something, before finally speaking:

“You… saw it again?”

I nod.

He’s quiet for a moment, then asks, “What did you see this time?”

I stare at the floor.

The broken glass has long been swept away. Only streaks of water remain where the mop passed.

The light hits them and flashes painfully.

“...You were kneeling on the ground, holding someone,” I say.

“Crying like hell.”

It sounds like I’m describing someone else’s story.

“Who was it?” His voice is very soft.

I look up at him.

The face looks similar. The eyes look similar. Even the way he holds his breath down is similar.

But the man in that memory… is “brighter” than the Silent Man in front of me.

So bright it hurts.

So bright it looks like he could shatter at any moment.

“I don’t know,” I answer honestly.

“I couldn’t see clearly.”

His shoulders loosen just a fraction, then tense again.

“That—” I swallow. “The person in his arms was probably me.”

That line sounds even more ridiculous than his “a thousand years ago.”

The second I say it out loud, I want to laugh at myself.

But I can’t.

Because my throat still hurts.

My body still remembers what it feels like when the blood seeps outward from the inside.

Silent Man doesn’t laugh.

He just stares at me, as if trying to read truth or lies in my face.

“There’s blood on your mouth,” he says suddenly.

I blink and instinctively wipe at it.

My fingertips come away faintly red.

It didn’t come back with me from the dream—

It’s real.

Cold spreads up from the soles of my feet.

“I–It’s just from before—”

“It’s the Mark reacting,” an unfamiliar yet familiar voice cuts in.

I jump and turn around.

Sethiel is leaning against the doorway. I have no idea when he arrived.

He isn’t wearing last night’s theatrical long coat. Today it’s just a shirt and light jacket. But that face isn’t ever going to turn into background decoration, no matter what you dress it in.

He looks a little tired, his brows slightly tensed, like a nobleman who stayed up too late.

“You’ve started remembering,” he says mildly.

“Earlier than I thought.”

Silent Man’s tone drops in temperature instantly.

“Who told you to come in?”

“The door wasn’t locked.” Sethiel gives him a lazy glance. “Besides, this place doesn’t count as a simple convenience store anymore.”

He looks at me. His gaze pauses a second at the smear of blood at my mouth, then falls to my hand.

“You saw the part where he was kneeling in the Wei flowers, didn’t you?”

One sentence nails itself straight through the dream I’ve just struggled my way out of.

I flinch. “You—”

“You’ve died once,” he says, his tone so flat it’s almost cruel.

“Don’t be too surprised.”

Silent Man grabs him by the collar, his whole body igniting.

“Shut up!” he roars.

It’s the first time I’ve seen him like this.

Not that usual restrained anger— but a fire that’s simply burst into open flame.

Sethiel, however, doesn’t panic at all. He only lowers his eyes to Silent Man’s hand on his clothes.

“You really don’t remember anything,” he says with a soft laugh.

“Last time *you* were the one kneeling down. Dying in her arms.”

Silent Man’s hand jolts.

The tremor doesn’t feel like fear of being exposed—it feels like something sealed too long inside him is starting to thrash.

“Enough,” he grits out.

“Sethiel, didn’t you say—”

“I’ve said a lot of things.” Sethiel cuts him off. “One of them was: ‘Memory comes with a price.’”

He shakes off the hand on his collar and straightens his clothes, like he’s wiping off something dirty.

Then he looks at me.

The way he looks at me is different now—not the mocking, toying look from before, but something… more serious.

“The Rose War isn’t some far-off legend,” he says.

“You used your death a thousand years ago to drag that war—barely—into the present.”

When he says “your death,” his tone doesn’t move at all, as if he’s saying “the coffee is hot.”

That coldness stings more than any exaggerated grief.

“Now your Mark is awake.” He taps his finger lightly against my chest.

“So the war has to continue.”

“Why does it *have* to be me?” I hear myself ask.

“Is the Rose that noble? Does the world really have to move forward by constant killing and fighting?”

The words come out sharp, but inside I’m rattled.

There’s still blood at my mouth. My throat still hurts. The scenes from the dream are still playing behind my eyes. It’s all too real.

Sethiel glances at me.

“You can choose not to believe,” he says.

“But you can’t choose not to be involved.”

“That’s not a choice. That’s bullshit.” I let out a short laugh.

“Sounds like you’re just rephrasing ‘I have no choice.’”

He doesn’t deny it.

Silent Man suddenly speaks up.

“She does.”

Sethiel narrows his eyes slightly. “And how are you planning to give her that?”

Silent Man turns to me. His gaze is heavy.

“You can keep pretending nothing happened,” he says slowly. “Tell yourself the dreams are just stress…”

“And then?” I cut him off.

“Then you’ll die on some night shift that looks a lot like this one,” Sethiel says, taking over smoothly.

“Blood at the corner of your mouth. Heart stopped. No one knows why.”

His voice is very calm as he says it.

That calm is more frightening than any threat.

“That’s what happens if you refuse to face the Mark,” he adds. “You get eaten alive by it and die pointlessly in the middle of your ‘ordinary life.’”

The picture is too specific.

So specific I can see it:

Me collapsed behind the counter, uniform stained with spilled coffee, phone on the floor, screen still lit, showing a message I never replied to.

That kind of death is more pathetic than being swallowed by light.

“...So if I ‘accept’ it?” I ask.

“If I stop pretending I’m just a convenience store clerk?”

Sethiel looks at me, the corner of his mouth curling with careless ease.

“Then at least you’ll die for something that matters,” he says.

Silent Man whips his head around. “Sethiel!”

“I’m just stating facts.” Sethiel shrugs.

“The Rose War isn’t a game. It won’t change its rules just because you don’t want her to die.”

He fixes his gaze on me. His eyes sharpen.

“What you’re carrying is the consequence of the choice you made a thousand years ago,” he says. “I’m not the one forcing it on you.”

A thousand years ago— Wei flowers, the battlefield, me saying “I don’t have a choice,” him kneeling and holding me.

The images flicker again.

My head throbs. I grab the counter to steady myself.

“So,” I take a breath, “you’re saying if I lie down and play dead, I really *will* die here. If I don’t lie down, and I face this so-called Rose War, I might still die, but… at least it won’t be for nothing.”

Sethiel thinks for a moment.

“That’s one way to put it,” he nods.

“You still have one more choice,” Silent Man says suddenly.

Both of us look at him.

His fists clench, like he’s trying to crush a thought before it fully forms and failing.

“You can choose not to forgive the me from a thousand years ago.”

That line is something I didn’t see coming at all.

I blink. “What do you mean?”

“The Rose War isn’t one-sided,” he says quietly. “It wasn’t just your choice that led to the ending.”

He lifts his eyes to look at Sethiel.

“What did I do?” he asks. “You’re not going to remind me?”

“You sure you want to know now?” Sethiel replies, expression unreadable.

Silent Man is silent for several seconds, then shakes his head.

“...No.” He says hoarsely. “Not before I’m qualified to hear it. I shouldn’t let her hear it either.”

He’s looking at me as he says that.

And suddenly I understand—

He’s more afraid of remembering than I am.

Because once he remembers, he might find out that he was not only the one holding me as I died—

He may also be the reason I died in his arms.

“All right.” I inhale slowly.

The metallic sweetness still lingers in my lungs; the taste of blood feels like some kind of reminder.

“I’m not going to start pointing fingers yet,” I say.

“Because I don’t remember anything.”

I look at the two men.

One in the light. One in the shadow.

One is held together by restraint about to break. The other is so cold it feels like he’s always been watching from outside.

“But there is one thing I’m sure of.”

They both wait.

“I can’t keep pretending I’m just some part-timer,” I say quietly.

“I can’t keep using ‘ordinary life’ as a line to comfort myself.”

The phrase sounds especially ironic right now.

Wei flowers. Marks. The Rose Court. War. A death from a thousand years ago—

Put those in front of me, and insisting “I’m just normal” becomes pure denial.

“So…” I lift my head. “What’s the first step of this Rose War?”

Sethiel looks at me and suddenly laughs.

This time the smile doesn’t look like he’s testing me. It carries a hint of *I knew it*.

“The first step is simple,” he says.

“You quit this job.”

“...That specific?”

“If you keep working here…” He shrugs. “You either die behind the counter or this store turns into a temporary exit for the battlefield. Neither is a great ending for a supposedly normal convenience store.”

It’s an annoyingly practical reason.

Practical enough to make me want to swear.

“I’ll resign tomorrow,” I say.

The words come out more cleanly than I expected.

Maybe because I know—

Even if I *don’t* resign, I’m going to get forcibly “discharged” soon anyway.

Sethiel nods.

“As for the real first step—” he continues.

“You’ll have to walk back to the Rose Court yourself.”

That’s where the Rose Duel is held.

The gate to war.

And the place where I died once, a thousand years ago.

“How?” I ask.

“You going to throw me in there like last time?”

“No one’s throwing you this time,” Sethiel says.

“You’ll walk in on your own.”

He looks at me, all trace of playfulness gone from his eyes.

“Because the Mark on your body will start leading the way.”

Right then, I suddenly feel heat in my chest.

Not on the skin—deeper.

The Mark isn’t in my palm. It isn’t on my forehead. It’s—

Near my heart.

Like something asleep in there has just turned over.

I suck in a breath and press my hand against that spot.

There’s no pulsing light. No movement.

Only that dull, simmering heat.

“...Fine,” I say.

“Whether you show the way or not, either way—”

I look at the streaked floor, the unstocked shelves, and the screen that’s been playing the same late-night infomercials forever.

“I’m not going back to what I used to call ‘a normal life.’”

When I say it out loud, my chest actually feels—lighter.

Like a decision that’s been dragging too long has finally been hit with “confirm.”

Silent Man closes his eyes briefly.

“I’ll stay by your side,” he says quietly.

It doesn’t sound like a promise. It sounds like a sentence he’s passing on himself:

Whatever he did a thousand years ago, he doesn’t plan to run this time.

Sethiel lets out a soft laugh. “Let’s hope you don’t end up kneeling in the Wei flowers holding her and crying again.”

Silent Man doesn’t answer.

But in that instant, the image flashes through my mind again—

Wei flowers. Blood. A man on his knees, holding me as his tears fall one by one onto my face.

I brush my fingers across the corner of my mouth.

Nothing’s officially started yet, but the war quietly moves one step forward.

The Rose War—

Begins the moment I stop using “ordinary” as an excuse.",1,1766588291.0,u_RedRoseScribe,0,1.0,False

# “Ms. Keaton, this miscarriage caused serious damage. Your chances of having children again are very low. You need to mentally prepare yourself.”

# Her mind buzzed.

# She had worked for three years to get pregnant. Finally, two months ago, she had succeeded.

# And now, this afternoon, a car had darted out of nowhere, knocking her down.

# The doctor frowned. “Ms. Keaton?”

# “Alright, I understand. Thank you, Doctor.”

# Ayla didn’t like showing weakness in front of others. She blinked quickly, forcing back her tears, then stood up and walked out.

# Behind her, she caught the whispers of two nurses. “Something this serious happened to her, and her husband never showed up?”

# “Don’t even mention it. Right after her procedure, she cried so hard she almost passed out and begged him to come. He never showed.”

# “Oh my gosh. If that isn’t a sign he doesn’t love her, then what is? If this doesn’t end in divorce, I’ll be shocked.”

# Ayla walked farther away and missed the rest of their conversation.

# The truth was, not only did Troy refuse to come, but he had also snapped at her over the phone. “The baby’s gone, so what? Stop crying about it. I’m busy. Stop bothering me.”

# After that, every call she made went unanswered.

# From the start, Troy never wanted her.

# Still, today she kept calling him, hoping he might care for the sake of their unborn child.

# Clearly, she had hoped for too much.

# Shaking off the thought, Ayla pulled out her phone to call a cab. Just then, a message popped

# up.

# It was from Max Bennett, Troy’s best friend. He had sent her a video.

# She clicked on it.

# The first shot was of an enormous bouquet of roses–at least 999 of them. There were so many flowers, the frame couldn’t hold them all.

# Then the camera shifted left. Troy appeared, standing beside a woman.

# Skyla Summer.

# Ayla’s pupils tightened. Her fingers gripped hard around her phone.

# In the video, voices rose with excitement. “Skyla, Troy knew you were coming back to the country today. He’s been planning this welcome party for weeks! He really went all out.

# “Come on, give him a hug to thank him!”

# “A hug? Please, just kiss already. It’s not like you two haven’t done it before. I still have that video of your three–minute intense kiss.”

# Skyla shook her head with a smile. “Not anymore; it’s not appropriate.”

# Before she could finish, Troy pulled her into his arms. “Skyla, welcome back.”

# Then she waited for Troy to come home.

# Many late nights after business dinners, Ayla often waited up for him,

# “You had surgery today. Shouldn’t you be resting?” His tone was flat, without the slightest care.

# All she ever got was his cold back.

# Troy’s gaze shifted to the suitcase by her side. He seemed to understand immediately. “You saw Max’s video, didn’t you?”

# “Yes, I saw it.”

# Up close, Ayla could smell the alcohol on him–mixed with heavy perfume that made her stomach turn.

# “We’re getting-” She didn’t get to finish before Troy cut her off.

# “Since you have found out, let’s just divorce. You knew from the start–if Skyla hadn’t gone overseas, I never would’ve married you.”

# At this point, Ayla couldn’t argue. “Fine.”

# “It’s late. Get some rest. You can move out tomorrow-

# “It’s fine. I’ve signed the divorce papers.”

# She pointed to the coffee table.

# On their wedding night, Troy had handed her the divorce papers. Only today did Ayla finally find the determination to sign them.

# This time, Troy was the one who looked surprised.

# He frowned, as if doubting whether she was serious.

# “I know you’ve been drinking. I made some lemon tea. It’s in the kitchen,” Ayla said after a

My dream begins without warning.

No sound. No picture. Just a huge, dim patch of light.

In the middle of the light stands a blurred figure— like a man, like a shadow.

He raises his hand. His fingertip brushes the center of my forehead.

The moment the warmth seeps through my skin, the dream starts to crack.

Then I see the first fragment.

**(Memory Fragment One)**

Full moon. Treetops. Cold wind.

White *Wei* flowers spread beneath my feet, like a sea kissed by frost.

I’m kneeling in the middle of the flower field, my dress soaked through as if I’ve been standing in the rain.

A man lies on the ground in front of me.

There is a wound in his chest—so deep I can’t see the bottom. Blood is surging out of it like a tide.

But what hurts me most isn’t the blood.

It’s the words he said before he fell— torn apart by the wind until they are almost impossible to hear:

“...Don’t… be… afraid.”

“Don’t be afraid—”

I jolt awake, my throat blocked by something I can’t name.

Cold sweat soaks the side of my neck.

The ceiling of the convenience store comes into focus. The fluorescent lights are painfully bright.

There’s a still-steaming cup of coffee on the counter in front of me.

Silent Man is sitting not far away, back against the wall, like he’s been keeping watch all night.

“You’re awake?”

His voice is soft, like he’s afraid of startling me.

I try to answer, but my throat is too dry. No sound comes out.

He immediately passes me a bottle of water. His fingers tremble slightly, like he’s holding something back.

“You were out for over an hour.”

He watches me. “Does anything hurt?”

I shake my head, but my heart is beating out of control.

That wasn’t a normal dream.

Something has been… pried open.

“Silent…” I look up at him. “Last night, what did we actually—”

Before I can finish, the door sensor chimes.

It’s not the sound it makes for customers. It’s deeper, sharper— not quite like a human stepping into the store at all.

Cold air pours in along the floor.

Instinctively, I shrink back.

Silent Man stands up and moves in front of me.

There are three figures standing outside the door.

None of them are “human.”

(1) Messengers of the Rose War

The one in the middle wears a dark gray robe with the hood pulled low to hide his face.

The two on either side look like guards. Their eyes are nothing but cold white.

The moment they step into the store, every bag of snacks on the shelves dents inward at once, like an invisible pressure has grabbed them by the throat.

“You’re awake.”

It’s the hooded man who speaks.

His voice isn’t loud, but every word lands like a knock on bone.

“Someone chosen by the Rose Mark would never sleep for long.”

Silent Man shifts even further in front of me, his body so tense it looks like it might crack.

“She has nothing to do with you,” he says in a low voice. “The Rose Duel has already begun. You can’t—”

“The duel is only the prologue,” the hooded man cuts in. “The Rose War is the true beginning.”

*The Rose War.*

The phrase hits my chest like a hammer.

No logic. No memory. Just a violent twist in my gut, like I’m about to throw something up.

The two guards turn their eyes on me— no emotion, no curiosity, just the way someone checks whether an item arrived intact.

The hooded man raises his hand.

A faint red light blooms at his fingertip, like a drop of blood frozen in the dark.

“The Mark of Wei… awakened faster than expected.”

I take a step back without meaning to.

“Wait—who *are* you?” I force my voice to stay steady, but the tail of it still shakes. “What do you want?”

He doesn’t answer me. He just speaks as if stating a law of nature:

“Those who awaken the Wei must return to the battlefield of the Wei.”

When Silent Man hears that, something in him snaps tight— like a beast recognizing a trap.

“She’s not going anywhere.”

His voice is a low growl, carrying open, unhidden killing intent for the first time.

The hooded man lets out a quiet sigh.

“You’ve forgotten too much, Silent. If Sethiel hadn’t covered for you, you would’ve recognized her the instant you saw her.”

He lifts his gaze. His words ring like a bell in the wind.

“A thousand years ago, it was *you* who ended the light of the Rose Court with your own hands.”

My breath stops dead.

“What… did you say?”

Silent Man jerks his head around to stare at him. His expression isn’t shock.

It’s fear.

The hooded man gives us no time to react.

He points at me.

The red light reaches out like a thread, stretching toward the center of my forehead.

My blood freezes, as if ice has been injected straight into my arteries.

My soles burn with cold.

I don’t even have the strength to step back.

“Don’t touch her!!!”

Silent Man throws himself between us, slamming his palm into the red light.

The entire store shudders like it’s been hit by a blast—

Glass display shelves crack at once. Bottles roll off and clatter across the floor.

Silent Man’s hand looks like it’s been plunged into a fire.

The skin blackens and splits in seconds.

“You don’t even know what you are,” the hooded man says coldly. “You think you’re ‘undying’? You’re just something the Rose hasn’t taken back yet.”

Silent Man grits his teeth and forces the words out through the pain:

“Get. Out.”

The hooded man tilts his head slightly.

“The one touched by the Wei cannot hide, Silent. The moment she woke, the Rose War began again.”

He steps back, as if his task is done, and leaves us with one last line:

“Let her choose— whether she wants the ending from back then to repeat.”

As soon as he finishes, the three of them vanish.

No sound. Like someone erased them from the world.

The store returns to normal, but the air feels like it has a deep crack running through it.

Silent Man shakes his hand hard. The black, burnt skin rapidly fades, like rot played in reverse.

He looks up at me.

There is a fear in his eyes so tightly pressed down it looks ready to shatter.

“Hanna… don’t believe them,” he says quietly.

“You’re not the kind of person they say you are.”

But the stone in my chest is throbbing.

When the light flared, I saw another fragment— a memory from even deeper down.

**(Memory Fragment Two)**

Night. A forest burning.

Light torn into pieces by the wind.

A man is kneeling in front of me. I can’t see his face clearly.

He’s holding my hand, and his palm is soaked in blood.

“Don’t use that.”

His voice is trembling. “It’ll kill you.”

I raise my other hand.

On that hand is the same mark that vanished from my palm today in the convenience store—

The Mark of Wei.

It’s burning.

Like fire. Like blood. Like fate.

“I don’t have a choice.”

I hear my own voice— calm to the point of cruelty.

He tries to hold me back, but I push his hand away.

The last thing I see is myself turning and walking toward the light.

Each step grows brighter.

So bright the world splits.

And then—

The dream shatters.

**(Present)**

I jerk my head up, gasping on the store floor.

Silent Man rushes over to support me. There’s obvious panic at the corners of his eyes.

“You saw it again?”

I grab a fistful of his uniform. My fingers are so cold they don’t feel like mine.

“Silent… that war—did I…”

Something twists around my throat.

I almost don’t dare say it.

“…start it?”

Silent Man’s pupils contract.

“No—you’re not—you…”

He can’t finish.

Because he doesn’t know either.

Because he’s missing more memories than I am.

In that moment, I realize—

I remembered before he did.

Silent Man stares at my palm.

“There’s a mark… on your hand again.”

I look down—

My palm is clean.

Nothing there.

But under the skin, there’s a faint scorched feeling.

Branded in the blood, not the flesh.

Silent Man closes his hand around mine. His voice drops to a near-prayer:

“Hanna… don’t join them. Don’t go to the Rose Court. Don’t go near the Rose again…”

“If you go back to your life now, it’s not too late.”

I look up.

For the first time, I really look into his eyes.

There’s fear there. And pain. And a kind of despair that comes from trying to stop something you know you can’t.

My breathing turns slow and rough.

“…It’s already too late.”

“What?” He freezes.

My eyelids tremble.

“What I saw… those weren’t dreams.”

My chest feels like it’s being ripped open. “I… can’t keep pretending I’m just a convenience store clerk.”

Silent Man’s face drains of color.

I curl my fingers into my palm.

Forcing the words out one at a time:

“I’ve been running for too long.”

The store is so quiet the only sound is the hum of the fridges.

Silent Man swallows. “Hanna…”

I lift my head and look at him.

For the first time, I realize—

This man is more afraid of fate than I am.

He’s not afraid *for himself*. He’s afraid *for me*.

But the burning forest in my dreams tells me one thing:

Once fate starts, it doesn’t stop.

I take a long breath.

“Silent…”

“What exactly is the Rose War?”

He lowers his head.

It’s a long time before he answers, voice nearly broken:

“…It’s the thing you and I failed to finish—”

“—a thousand years ago.”",1,1766588218.0,u_RedRoseScribe,0,1.0,False

# Ayla was in the hospital when the doctor spoke to her in a flat voice. 



# “Ms. Keaton, this miscarriage caused serious damage. Your chances of having children again are very low. You need to mentally prepare yourself.” 



# Her mind buzzed. 



# She had worked for three years to get pregnant. Finally, two months ago, she had succeeded. 



# And now, this afternoon, a car had darted out of nowhere, knocking her down. 



# The doctor frowned. “Ms. Keaton?” 



# “Alright, I understand. Thank you, Doctor.” 



# Ayla didn’t like showing weakness in front of others. She blinked quickly, forcing back her tears, then stood up and walked out. 



# Behind her, she caught the whispers of two nurses. “Something this serious happened to her, and her husband never showed up?” 



# “Don’t even mention it. Right after her procedure, she cried so hard she almost passed out and begged him to come. He never showed.” 



# “Oh my gosh. If that isn’t a sign he doesn’t love her, then what is? If this doesn’t end in divorce, I’ll be shocked.” 



# Ayla walked farther away and missed the rest of their conversation. 



# The truth was, not only did Troy refuse to come, but he had also snapped at her over the phone. “The baby’s gone, so what? Stop crying about it. I’m busy. Stop bothering me.” 



# After that, every call she made went unanswered. 



# For three years, Troy had always treated her this way–cold and distant.

# From the start, Troy never wanted her. 



# Still, today she kept calling him, hoping he might care for the sake of their unborn child. 



# Clearly, she had hoped for too much. 



# Shaking off the thought, Ayla pulled out her phone to call a cab. Just then, a message popped

# It was from Max Bennett, Troy’s best friend. He had sent her a video. 



# She clicked on it. 



# The first shot was of an enormous bouquet of roses–at least 999 of them. There were so many flowers, the frame couldn’t hold them all. 



# Then the camera shifted left. Troy appeared, standing beside a woman. 



# Skyla Summer. 



# Ayla’s pupils tightened. Her fingers gripped hard around her phone. 



# In the video, voices rose with excitement. “Skyla, Troy knew you were coming back to the country today. He’s been planning this welcome party for weeks! He really went all out. 



# “Come on, give him a hug to thank him!” 



# “A hug? Please, just kiss already. It’s not like you two haven’t done it before. I still have that video of your three–minute intense kiss.” 



# Skyla shook her head with a smile. “Not anymore; it’s not appropriate.” 



# Before she could finish, Troy pulled her into his arms. “Skyla, welcome back.” 



# He held her so naturally, so gently, it made the whole crowd scream.

# “Kiss! Kiss!”

# When Ayla got home, she started to pack her suitcase. 



# Over the years, her life had been simple–work, routine, nothing fancy. She rarely bought anything for herself. Other than clothes and important documents, there wasn’t much to take. A single 26–inch suitcase was enough.

# Troy walked through the living room and met her eyes.

# Many late nights after business dinners, Ayla often waited up for him, 



# “You had surgery today. Shouldn’t you be resting?” His tone was flat, without the slightest care.

# Max was shocked. “What? Divorced? Over a video? No way! Ayla wouldn’t leave you. If she really did, I’ll eat my hat!” 



# “I’m the one who brought that up,” Troy said.

# Everyone knew when Troy brought up divorce, it didn’t mean much. Ayla was famous for clinging to him like glue–he could never shake her off.

Am I crazy?","Around July of this year, I met this guy. I had actually known him from Tinder before that, but it didn't go anywhere because I was out of the country for a few weeks. When I got back in July, we matched again and everything seemed to go smoothly—or so I thought. He texted me every day and we talked constantly. When we finally met up at his house, we were having a glass of wine and he suddenly started saying how he’s not looking for anything serious. I was so confused because we met on a dating app where he specifically said he was not looking for hookups. I didn't say anything in the moment, and some things happened that night. I stayed over and it was honestly one of the most romantic nights of my life to date.

We met again a few days later and the same thing happened, but I started noticing a major shift in his attitude. He wouldn’t even ask if I got home safe. I would be leaving his place at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning in a part of town that isn't safe, and he couldn't be bothered to check in. To me, even if it's just FWB, shouldn't there be some ""friendship"" and basic care involved? After that, a few weeks went by without a single text. I knew it was done because the last few times I was the one initiating everything. We eventually talked again after he replied to one of my stories, and I confronted him about the ghosting and leaving me on read. He just claimed he was ""working"" and told me it was all in my head. I want to note that, because every single time I voiced a concern or told him something was bothering me, he would try to psychoanalyze it and tell me I was imagining things.

Another week goes by and he hits me up to meet again. I don't know why I did it, but I’ve been feeling so lonely since I moved to this new city away from everyone I know, and I think that influenced my decision. He was very kind to me this time, almost like a puppy—he doesn't think of me when I'm not there, but he's happy when I am. He always claims to be working, but then I see his stories and he's constantly out drinking wine and coffee with friends. Later on, while we were talking, he actually ""called me out"" for not wanting to go all the way with penetration. I told him straight up that I don’t do that unless I’m somewhat emotionally connected to someone. He already knew this because he had literally asked me in the middle of making out previously and I told him then, too.

I defended myself by saying I didn't feel safe doing that because I didn't think I was the only person he was seeing. I had seen him on Tinder updating his pictures and bio often, even while we were together. He claimed he was only on there ""to talk,"" which felt like a lie since he barely even talks to me when I text him. I told him I wanted to stop seeing each other if he was seeing other people because I didn't feel safe health-wise not knowing who else he was with. He promised he would tell me if he saw someone else, so I stopped worrying for a moment. But then, we went an entire month without talking—no texts, no story replies, just complete silence. I was getting so annoyed and confused that I decided to see who he was following. He had followed about 20 new people from Tinder and Grindr in our local community. How can he convince me I’m the only one he sees when he’s following that many new guys right after we met? There is no way they haven't met up. I feel like he's been lying to my face and making me feel crazy for having basic intuition.",1,1766588010.0,Situationships,4,1.0,False

1pup3ml,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1pup3ml/how_i_finally_broke_free_from_8_years_of_bad/,How I Finally Broke Free From 8 Years of Bad Habits: A Complete Guide,"TLDR: After 8 years trapped in a cycle of poor habits, I transformed my life by implementing systematic behavior change, environment design, identity shifting, and accountability systems. This guide breaks down exactly what worked, what didn't, and how to apply these principles to your own habits.

 for nearly a decade I was the definition of self-sabotage. My rock bottom came last winter when I realized I hadn't gone a single day in years without binge eating, procrastinating important work until the last minute, and staying up until 3 AM doom scrolling. My health was deteriorating, my career was stagnating, and my relationships were suffering. I was trapped in a prison of my own making.

THE FAILED ATTEMPTS

Before I share what worked, let me tell you what didn't. I tried cold turkey quitting (lasted 2 days), using willpower (depleted by noon), and setting ambitious goals (abandoned within a week). I downloaded productivity apps that went unused and bought planners that gathered dust. Each failure reinforced my belief that I was just ""wired this way"" and would never change.

ENVIRONMENT DESIGN

The first breakthrough came when I realized willpower is finite, but environment design is forever. I completely restructured my physical spaces:

* Removed all junk food and replaced with pre-prepped healthy meals
* Created a designated workspace with no entertainment devices
* Set up charging stations for all devices outside the bedroom
* Pre-packed gym bags and placed them by the door
* Deleted social media apps and set up website blockers

At first, I felt ridiculous baby-proofing my life this way. But I learned that successful habit change isn't about strength it's about removing friction from good behaviors and adding friction to bad ones. James Clear's ""Atomic Habits"" was instrumental in helping me understand this concept.

IDENTITY SHIFT

The next phase was the hardest but most transformative. Instead of focusing on what I wanted to do, I focused on who I wanted to become. I started making statements like:

* ""I'm a person who reads before bed"" (not ""I should read more"")
* ""I'm someone who prioritizes sleep"" (not ""I need to stop staying up late"")
* ""I'm the kind of person who shows up early"" (not ""I should stop being late"")

This identity-based approach felt fake at first almost like I was lying to myself. But over time, as I took small actions aligned with these identities, they started feeling genuine. The shift from ""trying to change"" to ""becoming someone else"" was profound.

HABIT STACKING AND TRIGGERS

I learned to attach new habits to existing ones, creating automatic triggers:

* After brushing teeth → 1 minute meditation
* After pouring morning coffee → write three priorities for the day
* After arriving home → immediately change into workout clothes
* After dinner → 15-minute cleanup

By connecting new behaviors to established routines, I bypassed the decision-making process that often derailed me.

ACCOUNTABILITY AND MEASUREMENT

I created simple tracking systems:

* A habit tracker app with daily check-ins
* Weekly reviews with measurable data points
* Monthly check-ins with an accountability partner
* Quarterly ""habit audits"" to eliminate what wasn't working

Seeing my progress visually provided both motivation and feedback. I could identify patterns like how poor sleep predictably led to poor eating the next day and adjust accordingly.

THE TRANSFORMATION

The first two months felt like pushing a boulder uphill. Everything was forced, uncomfortable, and unnatural. But around month three, something shifted. New behaviors started feeling easier than old ones. My energy levels improved, which made good decisions easier, which improved my energy further.

Now, eight months in, what once seemed impossible feels like my default mode. I've maintained consistent sleep, nutrition, and productivity habits. I've developed a reading practice, regular exercise routine, and mindfulness habits that have completely transformed my mental clarity.

THE SCIENCE OF HABIT CHANGE

Understanding the neurological basis of habits helped immensely. I learned about the habit loop (cue, craving, response, reward) and how to manipulate each component. I realized my bad habits weren't character flaws but automated responses to specific triggers.

Books that helped me understand this included:

* ""The Power of Habit"" by Charles Duhigg
* ""Tiny Habits"" by BJ Fogg
* ""Why We Do What We Do"" by Edward Deci

HANDLING SETBACKS

Perhaps the most important lesson was learning how to handle inevitable failures. Instead of letting a single slip-up become a complete relapse (the ""what the hell effect""), I developed a ""recovery protocol"" specific steps to take after breaking a habit streak.

This mental framework prevented the all-or-nothing thinking that had sabotaged my previous attempts.

I've learned that lasting change isn't about perfection but about how quickly you get back on track after deviating.

FINAL THOUGHTS

The journey from being controlled by habits to controlling them has been the most meaningful transformation of my life. What started as an attempt to fix specific behaviors has evolved into a completely different relationship with myself.

If you're currently struggling with bad habits that feel impossible to break, remember that action precedes motivation, not the other way around. You won't ""feel like"" changing until after you've started changing.

A sponsored ad popped up for a PBS airing of English National Ballet’s Nutcracker so I watched it and it completely delighted me. Some details I want to share: 

\- Rather than having the party, the battle, and snow for the first act, much of the party music portrays daily life in Edwardian London (the party scene still happens but is a little shorter than usual). 

\- Some key people throughout act one come back in various ways in act two. Between a costume piece, prop, color scheme, etc. there are definite callbacks in act two to people we met in act one. I found this very endearing because it gave a Wizard of Oz vibe (“I had a dream and you were there, and you were there… and so were you!”). 

\- There’s a significant change up in the sweets and for some Nutcracker purists this might be a deal breaker. Though I was initially confused, I think they pulled it off. Spanish nougat instead of chocolate, the Arabian coffee were used to is Egyptian hot orchid root milk with cinnamon (so oddly specific but it was cute), Chinese was candied hawthorn berries, the trepak was Ukrainian poppyseed rolls, marzipan/mirlitons looked like candy canes, and Mother Ginger was replaced with liquorice allsorts (still a giant set piece with small children inside). 

\- Fair warning, they do switch Clara’s which I typically don’t love, but the way they did this one made sense. The set design blew me away. The dancing is of course top notch but the acting too was perfect. 

Here’s a link to the performance: https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/the-nutcracker-about/17329/?rdt\_cid=5491074985302871278&utm\_source=reddit

A few months ago had a really bad bout of PETD in one ear lasting half a year.  It was very annoying, any bending over would trigger my ear going into “hollow mode” with the ET stuck open, and it would randomly happen during the day.  I could always “fix” it by violently throwing my head down and forwards but obviously you look like a mental patient if you do that in public.

I saw a GP/PCP and they were useless, they didn’t even understand what I was talking about. I then saw a ENT and they prescribed me fluonase which did nothing.  (In fact I think that was a bad thing to prescribe, that’s for if the ET is blocked, not open.)

In the end what fixed it was massively cutting down (not out) my caffeine consumption. 

I was starting my work mornings by drinking two luongo espressos (which is a lot by any measure) and then later on in the morning I’d have a regular coffee.

I went on a two week holiday where I didn’t have access to the work espresso machine. Lo and behold, even though I was still drinking some regular American coffee at breakfast, the PETD completely stopped and has never come back since.  I never restarted the luongos.

Of course, it’s impossible to say that the heightened caffeine consumption was the cause but seems highly likely to me.

Back in the second half of high school and first half of undergrad, I was pretty depressed and unable to really figure out what I wanted out of life. I got into a good university, flunked a few classes because of the depression and the fact natural aptitude had meant I'd never needed to learn how to study until college, wound up transferring, and got my degree (ultimately in computer science instead of engineering) from a much less well known school. After that, I got a pretty good job where I'm still working, and got a master's degree on the side. This job was satisfying enough for a while, but became an increasingly toxic environment with little opportunity for progression. I recently was offered a new job with a substantial pay increase, and I took it. I haven't started yet, but the problem is, this kind of made me realize how much I've been in a more functioning depressive state. I make decent money, I live on my own, I travel, and I still feel totally rudderless. I may not be incapable of doing the necessary things, as was the case when I was eighteen, but I'm still very much lacking a purpose. I feel like I'm on a hamster wheel, going through the motions, but unable to feel happy or like anything I'm doing matters.

People always say to get a job for money, and find meaning or happiness outside of work, but I really don't think that's working for me because of how much I rely on external structure to force me to do something other than wallow. I don't care about the money. Work gives me a reason to get out of bed. Grad school gave me a reason to get out of the house. Now I'm tempted to do a post-bacc pre-med program or something because the last time I felt much of anything was grad school. I know I like school and learning, at least. Probably being a doctor wouldn't actually make me happy, but the prospect of having a big chunk of schooling and having something productive to focus on is the most appealing thing I can think of. I haven't been able to really find any hobby that isn't reading or watching stuff because I get bored and abandon so many. I have seven rows of knitting I haven't touched in weeks on my coffee table, dozens of half written code projects on my hard drive, a Raspberry Pi in a box that I completely forget why I bought.

​Waking up to a ""milestone"" day without acknowledgment is incredibly heavy. It’s not just about the missing text or call; it’s the feeling of being unseen during a time of year when the world loudly insists that everyone should be surrounded by family.

​Holding Space for How You Feel
​It is completely valid to feel hurt, lonely, or even angry right now. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you navigate the next few weeks:
​
Social Media Isn't Reality: This time of year creates a ""happiness tax."" You’ll see endless photos of ""perfect"" families, but many people are struggling with the same isolation or performing for the camera. You aren't ""failing"" at the holidays.

​Family is a Variable, Not a Constant: Sometimes family relationships are fractured, or people are simply thoughtless. Their silence is a reflection of their own limitations or the current state of those relationships—it is not a reflection of your worth as a person.

​Survival is a Win: If the next two weeks feel like a marathon you didn't train for, it's okay to just focus on getting through them. You don't have to be ""festive.""

​Taking Back the Day
​Since today is still your day, consider doing one small thing that belongs only to you. It doesn't have to be a grand gesture; it’s just a way to acknowledge yourself:

​Change the Scenery: If you can, go to a movie, a library, or a coffee shop. Being in the presence of people—even strangers—can sometimes take the edge off the silence at home.

​Mute the Noise: If seeing holiday posts or family updates hurts, stay off social media for 24 hours. Protect your peace.

​The ""Future You"" Gift: Buy yourself something you’ve wanted or order your favorite meal. Treat yourself with the kindness you wish they were showing you.

**2:20 AM December the 4th, 2025:**



I feel terrible.



I have been trembling for hours now, and I cannot control it. My limbs also feel really heavy, making moving quite expensive in terms of energy.



It´s getting absurdly colder and colder each hour, but the TV says it´s 40 degrees, which is not extremely cold.

I can´t stop trembling.



I would love to take a hot shower, but it would only make me feel sleepier.



On top of everything, my head aches like hell right now. Not even three aspirines at once made any difference. Actually, the only difference is that now my stomach aches too.



Maybe eating something would help, but the only things I have in the fridge right now is a jar of greek yogurt and a couple cans of tuna. If I dare to eat that, I will probably throw up instantly.



Rummaging through the things in my suitcase I found something that left me perplexed. Way at the bottom of it, there was an old photo of my late father.

I don't know why or how it ended up there, I didn't even remember that photo even existed. My memories about my father are scarce and blurred, and our relationship was not as good as to be carrying a photo of him.



Seeing that picture made me feel something difficult to explain, but it surely left a bad feeling in my guts.



I will just leave it there for now.



**3:54 AM**

  


I don't remember what I was about to write. Honestly, I have been sitting here, with pen in hand, trying to remember, but I just don´t.



Whatever it was, I think



(*There is nothing else written afterwards in that paragraph*).

  


**5:07 AM** 



I completely forgot what happened. Remembering recent actions is becoming harder and harder.



Sunrise is still a couple hours away, and the cold is getting unbearable.



I spent the last hour walking around the room, trying to keep my limbs warm and not falling asleep, but I have big gaps in my memory and everything feels chopped.



Right now, as I write this line, it is starting to rain, and it sounds like rocks hitting the roof (unless it is actually hailing, which would be funny).



This is getting exhausting, too exhausting. I don´t even know what I will do for the rest of the day, and it´s barely starting. 



**8:26 AM**



I opened the front door, just to find an ugly dog taking a dump right in front of it.



I opened the door and I chased it away with clicks and whistles. Of all the places he could have possibly used to take a shit, he did it right in front of my door, that is incredible.



I cleaned it up and went for a walk. It stopped raining a couple hours ago, and now it's sunny.



**10:50 AM**



I made a terrible mess.



I was making some eggs, when I realized I never called my wife back. So then I rushed to find my cellphone, only to find it had completely run out of battery.

After putting it to charge for some minutes and then turning it on, I found dozens of other missed calls from my wife.

My heart started racing and I tried to call her back for a few minutes. Finally, she took the call. She was really mad.

I felt like teenagers feel when they when they (*the repetition here is not a transcription mistake, this is how the subject wrote it originally*) are scolded by their parents for being absent too much and not answering calls.

I have to admit that I most likely gave too much importance to the situation and got extremely anxious.



Still, I managed to handle the situation well and told her I couldn´t find the charger for the phone. The last thing I need is that she thinks I am being unfaithful to her or something of the kind.



When everything was over, I found the hall completely covered in smoke. I had forgotten about the eggs and burned them completely. This forced me to open all the windows and wash the pan for several minutes.



All that smoke made me feel dizzy, so I will get outside for some clean air before I pass out.



**3:12 PM**



I lived something devastating.



When I got out to grab some air, Eric came to me to check if I was alright.

As we were chatting, a woman around my age came running towards us completely wildly and with a heartbreaking expression. She was desperately asking for help and guided us towards her home, where we saw the last thing one would like to see.

Her teenage son was hanging from a rope around his neck. 



Even though she was desperately screaming for us to get him down from there, it was clear there was nothing to do. He was cold, his skin had turned blueish and he had no pulse.



Some more neighbors came afterwards, and then so did the police and some other family members.



That image is still stuck in my mind and I don't think it will ever go away. Poor woman.

I wonder if we had gotten there some minutes before if it would have been different.



**6:30 PM**



I took a shower to see if it could help in any way, and then bought some beer to calm the stress.



I have been alcohol free for almost a year now, and I don't think this will do any good to the experiment, but I couldn't handle it anymore.

The vivid image of that boy, along with his mother's heartbreaking screams, is etched in my mind.



To make matters worse, I hear the rat sounds coming from the locked room again. This time is louder and more disgusting, like if they were more than they were before.

Either the poison did not work, or these are new rats.

I will put some more poison, which I will have to buy from the store, and if this doesn´t fix it I'll call the cabin owner to get a solution.



I didn´t pay for a cabin full of damn rats.



**8:02 PM**



I made some coffee, and then I went to the hardware store to buy some more poison, but it turns out they don't have any more. This really frustrated me.

I am a grown, reasonable man, and I was raised to respect people, but I have to admit I got a little agitated with the cashier. I got more agitated than the situation justified. Then I understood it wasn´t her fault, gave the corresponding apologies and left. 



After calling the cabin owner, he told me that a storm is coming, and that the maintenance won't be able to reach the area at least for a whole 24 hours.

I am considerably mad. I cannot understand why I can´t get a solution for something that basic.



Now I am waiting for a pizza. I am really, really hungry. I asked for two pizzas, actually.



**10:21 PM**



I devoured the pizzas as soon as they brought them. I should have not done that.

Now I feel sick, very sick.



The sound of the rain is mixing with the sound of the rats in the locked room and this must be the closest thing to what hell sounds like.

Moreover, my head feels about to explode. I took two aspirin and it only made me feel more sick in the stomach.



I really miss the comfort of my home right now as well as my wife and kids.



I still have seven full days ahead, and I don´t know what´s going to come out of this.



**11:00 PM**



I heard some noise in the backyard. When I went outside and turned the light on to see what it was, I saw a coyote. He noticed my presence, and we made direct eye contact. I couldn't move. I was scared.

But then I noticed it was hurt.

Its front right leg was bleeding, and he looked odd, malnourished.

I cannot explain it for the life of mine, but I felt the need to aid it. It was limping, and looked vulnerable, so I knew it couldn´t possibly hurt me. 

When I tried to approach it, it ran away, as fast as it could with its wounded leg.



I really wonder what could have possibly done that to it.



**11:23 PM**



I caught myself staring at the locked door longer than necessary.

  


Day 5



**2:58 AM December the 5th, 2025:**



I woke up suddenly, although I don´t remember falling asleep at any point. I don´t even know how much time passed since I sat on the couch. All I know is I found myself sitting in front of the TV. I don´t remember what was on, all I remember was sitting there with the room in a pitch dark, except for a single white light coming from the TV.



I have started to see dark figures through my peripheral vision, and this genuinely worries me. This is the kind of thing that tells you something is off.



All the lights on the cabin are turned on now, because I am genuinely unsettled. Every piece of furniture cracking, the hum of the fridge, the tick of the clock, everything combines to make the atmosphere feel dark, sinister, unfamiliar.



The rat noise coming from the locked room is becoming so loud and disgusting that it makes me want to throw up. I'm going to turn the television volume up as high as possible, and tomorrow I will try to get poison one way or the other.



**7:05 AM**



I am hungry, but I don't feel like making breakfast right now. I am progressively losing coordination and doing basic stuff is becoming more and more difficult and demanding.



I will microwave a couple leftover slices of pizza and make some coffee, and that will be it for this morning.

I am completely sure I am forgetting something, but I just can´t tell what it is.



PS: The cross is lying on the floor again. At this point this is becoming irrational. I will just leave it there.



**9:47 AM**



I got some rat poison from Eric.

I told him I hadn´t been able to get any from the store, and he gave me a bag he already had. It's good to have someone like him to rely on for this kind of situation.



I put some through the hole in the door and I will wait to see what happens.

I hope it works this time or I will go completely mad.



**10:49 AM**



I sat on the bed for a long while trying to remember what I was doing in the bedroom. I am having frequent gaps in my short term memory, and if it wasn´t for this journal, I wouldn´t know if I put the poison or not.



Now I am playing some Vivaldi compositions. His music makes me feel strong emotions, and it pulls me back when I feel like I’m drifting too far away.

There is something unsettling about how powerful music is. Just sound, arranged in a certain way, and it can change how you feel completely. It feels too precise to be accidental.

Sometimes I think music is the clearest proof that we were designed. That someone understood exactly how we work. That idea should be comforting, but right now I’m not sure it is.

Music is perfection within chaos.

**12:00 PM**

At some point I approached the locked door. A disgusting smell is coming from there. The noise won't go away either. I strongly considered forcing it, I need to go inside and see what is there. 

Then I discarded the idea.

I will make myself something to eat, and then I will figure out what to do the rest of the day.

By the way, dog feces are constantly appearing in my front door, and I am starting to grow fed up with this dog.



**4:12 PM**



I stood for a while in front of what would be my lunch. Completely burned chicken and some eggs. This is even becoming dangerous.



I tried to salvage anything edible from all of that, but now I am starving.



I am trying to remember what happened all through this afternoon. There is a big gap there that I can´t fill. 

Probably nothing important or worth of outlining, or I would have recorded it here, but it makes me considerably worried.



I am really, really considering taking a short nap, something around 20 or 30 minutes. But if I did, it would certainly count as cheating, I prefer not to take the risk.



**6:35 PM**



I made myself a strong coffee and then I went for a light jogging.



It seems it was too demanding for my body, because at some point I collapsed.

When I woke up utterly confused, disoriented and with a pulsating headache, a woman was next to me. She insisted on taking me to the hospital, but I kindly refused. 



I came back to the cabin slowly, breathing deeply and trying to recompose.



Now I know I shouldn´t do that kind of exercise for now. 



**7:20 PM**



I couldn't bear it any more.



After trying to call the cabin owner without response, I decided to grab the axe and smash the lock.



Then I stopped myself from doing it.



I have to wait, and avoid doing stupid stuff for things that do have a solution.



**10:50 PM**



I engulfed two pizzas that I ordered. Then I got terrible diarrhea.

I started feeling extremely sick. Then, after going to the toilet, I felt considerably better.



But now I feel weak, completely devoid of energy.

Also, I started feeling an annoying pain in my left eye. I don't know if it´s a product of having collapsed on the street, or if it´s something else.



I will wait before I take any action.



By moments, I also feel that putrid smell I felt earlier. I searched every corner of the house. I can smell it with the same intensity in every spot of the house, so I am not completely sure if it really comes from the locked room.



I will watch some TV and try to stand up and walk around every few minutes so I don't fall asleep by accident.



PS: I caught that ugly dog taking a dump in front of my door again.



I really considered doing something horrible, but then I quickly discarded it.

Now I feel terrible for even coming up with the idea.



PS 2: I am starting to see odd figures in the dark, like those you see when there's a pile of clothes on a chair. Also, I see movement in my peripheral vision.

This is not good.

We don't see each other often, maybe once a year, and we don't really keep in contact apart from that. When I returned home, I noticed that I was feeling very anxious, nauseous even, and I started thinking back to the conversations we had that afternoon. 

This is what happened: I told them that my little sister (13F) is growing really fast right now and is now taller than me (I'm 5'3""). He made a comment about her maybe having trouble finding a partner later if she gets too tall. I told him I don't think so and I wouldn't care if my partner was shorter than me. He then said that I would care and maybe wouldn't even be with my fiancé if he was shorter than me (he's not very tall btw, around 5'6""). I then said no, I wouldn't care about that but he kept insisting that I'm only saying that because it's easy for me to say as I'm short and I probably wouldn't have dated my fiancé in the first place if he'd been shorter. He then also said that my fiancé (38M) ""is doing the right thing by being with a younger woman"". In front of my aunt who is the same age as him! That felt very inappropriate to me, and my aunt even tried defending herself by saying that she is a few months younger than him. We also talked about parenting and he said that their parenting style is very modern without harsh punishment or blackmailing their kids. I said that's great, and he said something like ""I don't know about that, it depends on how you look at it"" and that he and my aunt disagree on that (making it seem like he wants to parent them with those outdated methods but my aunt doesn't?). 

For some context, I grew up with narcissistic parents, and so did my aunt (with my grandparents) but she has never gone to therapy or done anything else to try to heal. She doesn't even acknowledge that they are narcs and I can't use the word abuse around her because she gets uncomfortable.

This kept me up for hours last night, and I remembered a situation that happened when I was maybe 19 or 20. I wore a dress and tights for Christmas because it was cold and I wanted the extra warmth from the tights. Mark made a comment about the tights being ""maybe a bit too sexy"" or ""too hot"" to wear around family (they were nothing special, just tights with an argyle pattern). I didn't say anything at the time but looking back that seems really inappropriate.

I felt mansplained, misunderstood, gaslit and just downright uncomfortable with some of the things he said. I feel like I didn't make my views and opinions clear enough as I tend to try to keep the peace and don't want to make people uncomfortable. But I wish I had stood up for myself and my values more.

I decided to call my aunt today to try to talk about what happened yesterday and let her know that I don't want her husband to talk to me like that and make assumptions about me even though he hardly knows me. I'm crying now and I regret having called her as she immediately got very defensive. She never tried to heal from her own narcissistic upbringing and I'm starting to feel like she might not fully know what it's like to be truly respected and treated well?

I also felt gaslit/not taken seriously by her because she kept trying to defend her husband's comments by implying that I'm just too sensitive (favourite assumption about me in my whole family), saying things like ""you shouldn't take stuff like that so seriously"", ""don't let it affect you so much"", ""I'm sorry you feel that way"", ""he likes being a bit chauvinistic on the outside, but that's not how he really thinks"". I had suspected that he said the things about height preference in partners because it's a sensitive topic for him as he's not very tall (around 5'7""), and without voicing my suspicion to her my aunt said at one point ""I think you should consider that maybe he says those things because it's a sensitive topic for him"". I hate when people say those things because my narc mom used to use pretty much this exact phrasing in my native language to gaslight me and make me feel like I'm not reflecting enough and should think about things differently (as in I am the problem and I'm just too sensitive and keep misunderstanding things on purpose).

But my aunt also admitted that I'm not the only one who has a problem with how her husband presents himself, but ""those who know how to deal with it are okay with it"" . And she tried to explain to me that people can't be considerate and reflective in every second of life (as if I wasn't aware of that) and that he is overworked and overloaded and doesn't have the capacity to always say the right thing. That just feels like enabling to me. Of course I sometimes say things that I don't mean but then I apologise and talk about it and not try to make excuses and make the other person feel like they are being too sensitive. I would never be disrespectful to anyone and double down when they defend themselves like he did yesterday when I told him that I genuinely don't care about my partner's height.

I feel like I'm misunderstood and like my family thinks I'm just immature. There is much I still have to learn but it feels like they are the ones who haven't matured past the age of 5?!

About a month ago my ex (40M) ended things very suddenly and I am still struggling to make sense of it.
We met in June 2025 on a dating app. Texyed for about 10 days before we met. From that very start of texting, he pursued me very strongly. Constant messages from morning to night, affectionate language, pet names early on, checking in often. I was honest that I had trust issues from my previous long relationship, and he reassured me repeatedly that I could trust him and that he wanted something real. He said he only wanted to see me, and while we never officially defined things early on, I wasn’t seeing anyone else.
A few weeks in, he suggested a road trip. During that trip we had two misunderstandings. One was when he asked if I had checked my dating app. I told him I’d opened it because I received a message. He didn’t like that. The next day he became upset that I’d been in the shower too long while he picked up breakfast and the food got cold. He said I didn’t appreciate what he did, which honestly wasn’t true. I thanked him and it felt like a misinterpretation, but i feel maybe it stayed with him.

About two weeks into dating, he also got upset that I didn’t reach out sooner to help with putting together my niece’s toy car for her birthday. He asked me, “If I hadn’t messaged you, would you have?” and said he needed to see more effort from me. I said I also wanted to see effort from him that we were juat getting to know each other. I was going to end things the next day because it just felt off, but he told me it was a small misunderstanding and that he didn’t want to walk away from someone he thought was “rare.” a week later he asked if I was seeing anyone cause he noticed I changed what I was looking for on the apps and asked whether he should get tested"". I reassured him I haven't beeing seing anyone else and dont intend to. We still weren't official at this point. 
 
A few weeks later, before ankther trip we had planned to go on together (it was meant to be solo when I met him but he literally invited himself and I said yes), he sent me a message saying he couldn’t be the man for me and wanted to end things. This came after a week where I thought we had resolved some misunderstandings. We talked, and I was devastated because by then I really liked him. That night I sent him a message saying I didn’t want it to be over, that I hadn’t fully expressed how I felt, and that I wanted to try and work through things together if he would. He said he couldn’t do it but was open to talking.

I went to his house the following day and spent four hours trying to understand what the issue actually was. He said things like my “energy changes,” that he had trust issues, but couldn’t give clear examples or tell me what I’d done wrong. I left crushed. The next day he sent a final message saying he knew I’d been on dating apps and couldn’t get past that. I was devastated and confused because I wasn’t seeing anyone else and told him I only wanted to be with him and I wanted him to be my boyfriend.

A few days later, he messaged saying the last few months were great and that he didn’t want me to think he hadn’t cared and he had trust issues. But we never talked about that situation ever again. We ended up getting back together, and he asked if we could still go away on the trip we’d booked. I asked in what capacity because I couldn’t do “just friends.” He said, “No, my girlfriend.” I was ecstatic.
We went away and the trip was genuinely amazing. We bonded, laughed, relaxed, and connected deeply. But I did notice he referred to me as a “friend” to someone at one point, which I mentally noted but didn’t raise.
When we got back, everything shifted. He said it felt “weird” to text after spending 24 hours together, which confused me because previously he worried if we hadn’t texted for a few hours. He started pulling away emotionally. He stopped checking in about us, stopped expressing affection verbally, and felt distant. I tried to stay calm and understanding because I didn’t want to scare him off.

My luggage was lost after the trip, and I spent a whole night stressed dealing with the airline. He checked in briefly but didn’t come with me to the airport. That same day I found out he’d gone for beers with a female friend he “bumped into.” I was hurt he didnt join me and how emotionally dismissive he was but didn’t say anything at the time.

A week later, I asked what was going on. That night he said, “In my heart I feel like you’re my girlfriend, but I can’t call you that.” He said we didn’t know each other well enough, that girlfriend meant marriage, plus-one, and permanence to him, but that he wanted to stay exclusive. I was already emotionally attached and honestly falling in love. I should probably have walked away, but he said he still wanted to keep trying.
Around this time, he also criticised me for wanting to feel prioritised. He said he preferred last-minute plans and didn’t like feeling things were “scheduled,” while I said I just didn’t want to feel like an afterthought. He rarely planned actual dates and mostly just dropped by my area. When I once jokingly texted, “Are you going to make me an offer I can’t refuse?” about a date, he later told me he’d been upset because he felt like he had to perform. I had no idea he was upset at the time.

A few weeks later, a woman called him while we were together and he didn’t answer. Later that night I asked who it was. He said it was just a friend and that she’d likely been calling to ask him for drinks and would have said, “Are you with your girlfriend? Bring her.” I asked, “Girlfriend?” He said yes, quietly, and told me he’d said before the label would happen naturally and didn’t need a conversation. I found this confusing and unsettling, but went along with it.

He helped me find a new apartment and move into it, took a day off work, and even bought me a coffee machine as a housewarming gift. He then invited me to meet two of his best friends. They told me they’d heard so much about me and he admitted that I was the first person he’d introduced like this. That night he asked me, “Do you see me differently now that you’ve met them?” I didn’t understand the question. I told him I felt like he treated me more like a mate and that I was missing emotional intimacy. He told me he couldn’t give vulnerability and didn’t know how.

After that, he became even more withdrawn. He took me away for my birthday, which was lovely, but emotionally he felt distant. I went away to another city for a short trip soon after, and when I returned he picked me up but felt cold and reserved. The next day, Nov 24, at a cafe, he ended things.

He said his feelings hadn’t grown, that he knew what I was asking for emotionally and couldn’t give it, and that when I went away he missed me but didn’t “pine.” He brought up things like my tone, passive-aggressive text I sent while I was away, that I didnt seem happy about the birthday gift and said, “You wanted me to do this.” I was blindsided. I had wanted to talk and work through things, not end them.

We exchanged a few messages a week later where I reached out. I told him I had fallen in love with him, that I never wanted to hurt him, and that I understood he didn’t feel the same even though it broke my heart. He replied saying he knew it was the right path and that he wished he could return my feelings.

It’s been a month. I miss him deeply and want to talk to him... I feel hurt, confused, and like the ground disappeared under me. He still watched my stories until I deactivated Instagram because I wasn’t ready to remove him yet.
I keep replaying everything and wondering what I did wrong, why he couldn’t talk to me earlier, and how something that felt so intense and meaningful could end so abruptly. I don’t believe it was all fake, but I don’t understand how it ended this way. 

If anyone has insight into what might have been going on or can help me make sense of this, I would really appreciate it. Maybe he just needs some time.",0,1766586506.0,relationship_advice,12,0.5,False

Yes, that’s what happened, and even though there was no physical contact whatsoever I feel like I’ve now become something I’ve despised my whole life.

Or have I? Is this really cheating? 

Long story short, some time ago I started talking to an engaged coworker of mine, nothing serious. A few weeks in and we’ve ended up taking A LOT about literally everything, sharing some intimate details of our lives, meeting in secrecy just to have a coffee and talk. There was never any romantic thing going on whatsoever, but we both hid it from our partners, there’s no point in denying that, as well as admitting that I really like her and I suppose she likes me.

I love my girlfriend (together for 2 years), I do care about her and I feel like an absolute di\\\\\\\*khead for doing that. I was thinking on why am I doing this and I feel like I just don’t feel understood in my relationship when it comes to… life? My girlfriend has always avoided many topics, especially deep ones as they make her sad, cry and she just hates talking about them. I on the other hand mainly talk about such things, love theoretizing about everything, I just enjoy talking about something more that what I’d like to eat or where I’d like to go. This sh\\\\\\\*t sounds cruel but I did come to this realization after a long time - my girlfriend literally can’t talk about anything other than what she would like to do, have or eat. Anything else is too hard for her and makes her cry or starts a mood swing.

I knew my girlfriend is like that, it’s not her fault nor have I ever expected her to change. There’s absolutely nothing wrong about her other than being very, very sensitive and emotional which makes her everyday life hard - this is also what keeps her from being able to talk about anything serious as she starts breaking into tears, as “life’s too hard for her”. I talked to her about this many times for over a year, she refused going into therapy. I suggested going together, her and me, but her approach is (“I know it’s hard for me and you, but therapy requires work and I don’t want to put all my energy into something that scares me”). I sort of gave up after hearing that.

I don’t consider this an excuse, it’s simply the reason, not a way of justification. I had the same done to me twice in the past by girls. I would rather not know, to be honest. That’s why I want advice.

I guess I’ve reached a breaking point where… well I’m not even sure what the \\\\\\\* am I doing with my life and how to proceed from here. I’m meeting an engaged woman for late night drives and talks while mine nor her partner have any clue what’s going on.

I’m unsure on how to proceed and what to do about this entire situation.

tl;dr - I met and started talking with engaged coworker. This has turned into regular conversations and meetups that made me realize the issues I have in my current relationship aren’t as minor as I have thought. ",8,1766586379.0,relationships,23,0.68,False

I am thinking of maybe taking 10 bags. 

Little bit about me so it would help. I brew 80% on V60 and 20% on OXO brewer as a soup or Timemore B75. I like my coffee to be a bit sharp acidic, clean, good after taster and not much for body. So almost tea like, so I usually drink light roasts. The grinder I use is Pietro with Pro brew burrs. Regarding the coffee I prefer mine to be fruity and floral.

Here's what blew my mind: most guys are unknowingly sabotaging their attractiveness through terrible movement patterns. We're talking hunched shoulders, jerky movements, fidgeting, the whole disaster package. And here's the kicker: it's not entirely your fault. Modern life has literally rewired how we move. We sit for 8+ hours daily, stare at screens, and our biology is fighting against concrete jungles and office chairs. But the good news? Movement can be relearned. Your body is insanely adaptable.



Stop treating your body like a passenger vehicle



Your posture broadcasts your internal state before you even open your mouth. Research shows people form impressions within milliseconds based purely on how you carry yourself. Standing tall with shoulders back isn't about military rigidity. It's about occupying space confidently. Practice ""stacking"" your skeleton: feet under hips, hips under shoulders, head balanced on top. Not forced, just aligned. When you walk, lead with your chest, not your head. Most guys crane their necks forward like turtles. Brutal look.



Slow down your movements by 30%



High status individuals move deliberately. They're never in a rush. Next time you reach for your coffee or turn to talk to someone, consciously slow it down. Rushed, twitchy movements scream anxiety and low confidence. This applies everywhere: how you sit down, gesture while talking, even how you turn your head. Watch any James Bond film. Notice how economical his movements are. That's not acting, that's intentional physical presence.



The power of strategic stillness



Fidgeting destroys presence. Tapping feet, playing with phones, adjusting clothing constantly. These are nervous energy leaks. Train yourself to be comfortable with stillness. When sitting, plant both feet flat. Rest your hands visibly on the table or armrests. When standing, find a stable stance and hold it. This takes practice because our brains are wired to discharge nervous energy through movement. But mastering stillness creates magnetic presence.



Amy Cuddy's research at Harvard (yes, the TED talk that blew up) proved that holding expansive postures for just two minutes increases testosterone and decreases cortisol. Your body literally changes your brain chemistry. Her book ""Presence"" is ridiculous good. She's a social psychologist who broke down exactly how physicality shapes psychology. The book covers power posing, overcoming imposter syndrome, and why your grandmother was right about standing up straight. Read it before any important meeting or date. Seriously transforms how you show up.



Master the handshake and physical touch



Firm handshakes matter. Not bone crushing, but solid. Make palm to palm contact, two pumps, done. Weak handshakes kill first impressions instantly. Beyond handshakes, appropriate touch builds connection. A hand on the shoulder, brief contact on the arm while laughing. This requires calibration and reading social cues, but strategic touch (when welcomed) accelerates rapport dramatically.



Fix your walking pattern



Most guys shuffle or stomp. Your gait should be smooth, heel to toe, with natural arm swing. Imagine you're walking on a straight line. Keep your head level, not bobbing up and down. Your stride should match your height, don't overstep trying to look aggressive. Check out Alexander Technique resources on YouTube. This century old method teaches natural, efficient movement patterns. Insanely helpful for undoing years of tension and poor habits.



Train spatial awareness



Know where your body is in space at all times. Don't bump into things, invade personal space accidentally, or seem clumsy. This comes from being present in your body rather than lost in your head. Martial arts or dance classes accelerate this learning curve dramatically. Even basic boxing or salsa dancing teaches body control and awareness that transfers everywhere.



For tracking progress, the Posture Screen app uses your phone camera to analyze posture and provides corrective exercises. Takes two minutes, gives you objective feedback on shoulder alignment, head position, and spine curvature. Way better than guessing.



BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia University alumni and former Google experts that generates personalized audio content from books, research papers, and expert interviews. 



Type in something like ""improve body language and presence"" and it pulls from high-quality sources to create a custom podcast and adaptive learning plan tailored to your goals. The depth control is clutch, you can do a 10-minute overview or switch to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples and context when something clicks. The voice options are borderline addictive, there's this deep smoky tone that sounds like Samantha from Her, or you can go with something more energetic for gym sessions. 



It includes all the books mentioned here plus way more, and since most learning happens during commutes or workouts, having everything in audio format that adapts to what specifically matters changes the game. The cute AI coach Freedia lets you pause mid-session to ask questions or get clarifications, which beats rewinding podcasts trying to catch one point. Honestly replaced most of my doomscrolling time with it.



The gym as movement laboratory



Lifting weights isn't just about muscle. It's learning to move under load with perfect form. Deadlifts teach hip hinging. Overhead press demands core stability. Squats require ankle mobility and balance. These movement patterns transfer directly to daily life. You'll naturally move better carrying groceries, picking things up, everything. Find a coach initially to learn proper form. Bad movement patterns under weight just reinforces dysfunction.



Joe Rogan constantly talks about movement quality on his podcast. His episodes with Ido Portal (movement culture founder) and Kelly Starrett (mobility expert) are essential viewing. They break down why most people move like broken robots and how to fix it. Portal's philosophy is simple: move more, move better, move in varied ways. Your body isn't designed for repetitive patterns.



Breathing changes everything



Shallow chest breathing keeps you in fight or flight mode. Deep diaphragmatic breathing calms your nervous system and naturally improves posture. Most guys breathe backwards: chest expands on inhale. Should be the opposite. Belly expands first, then ribs, then chest. Practice this lying down initially. Five minutes daily of conscious breathing rewires your autonomic nervous system. Sounds basic but this alone transforms physical presence.



Your movement is your silent language. It communicates confidence, health, status, and intention without saying a word. Modern life has messed this up for most guys, but the hardware is still there. You just need to consciously reprogram the software. Start with one thing: slowing down your movements by 30%. Notice how differently people respond to you. Then build from there.",1,1766585850.0,Buildingmyfutureself,0,1.0,False
