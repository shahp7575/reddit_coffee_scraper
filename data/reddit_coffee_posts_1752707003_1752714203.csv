1m1u18t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m1u18t,Longtime customer. Were told they wont take order from me after waiting in a long line.,"Title. I have been a long time Starbuck drinker and never have this problem before so I am super confused. Were I being unreasonable??

Today after work I decided to treat myself a drink. I commute by bus everyday so I commute to this Starbucks location. After a 30 minute ride I arrive and saw the ‚Äúsorry were close but our drive through is open‚Äù sign.

I walk to the drive through line, waited for a while under the sun. When its my turn the driver through radio didn‚Äôt respond to me. I tried for 5 minutes with no response.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine im ordering at the window‚Äù I thought. 

After waiting to get to the window, a worker just abruptly told me they won‚Äôt take my order because im not in a car???

How hard is it to let me order a drink? I was sympathize with them for being short staff but the way they treat me is just cruel. 

Is it normal for starbuck to do this? Any other good coffee shop nearby?

Drop soft drinks, milk tea, and fruit juice. Replace with water, coffee, or unsweetened tea.

Hello‚Ä¶. 

Well-educated, classy, good girl seeks handsome gentleman 25+ for an evening of good food and conversation. Please be single (as am I). 

If you are married or attached DO NOT SPAM MY DMs. Thank you. I have no interest in becoming a non-consenting participant to adultery or cheating. Nor do I have time / energy for unavailable people should we wind up liking each other. 

About me:
Single, no kids, self-assured, well socialized can be quiet or chatty depending on the vibe. I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm very easy to talk to. I‚Äôm most at peace and in my element amongst nature / outdoors. Likes poetry. Animal lover. Weekends I like to play music while cooking up some brunch‚Ä¶ eggs, pancakes, coffee. I‚Äôve a fondness for Etta James and some classics. But also love me some blue grass folk, anything with soul really. My playlist is extensive and diverse. I take care of myself, have been flying solo for the last few years enjoying my solitude and focusing on friends, work, and personal growth and goals. Appearance wise my ethnicity is Asian. Height: 5‚Äô5‚Äù. Weight: 120lbs. Hair: long, dark, wavy. Body type: lean/slender/ athletic and small up top. Skin tone: tan. Smile: A+

About you: 
I‚Äôm looking for intelligence, emotional maturity, quiet confidence, non-performer energy, presence. Good conversationalist. Comfortable pauses. Someone that takes care of themselves too - just be healthy and height x weight proportionate or somewhat fit with good hair and a great smile. Clean-shaven or neat stubble; neatly trimmed beard maybe. Definitely not into full beards or bald heads (sorry!) Pretty boys and rugged jawlines welcome. Good personality and character are a must. European or Caucasian. Quality over quantity type. 

If you send me a DM, please include your age, gender, location, height, ethnicity. A sfw photo would be helpful as well. Happy to exchange.

And maybe they‚Äôre right.  
Because it‚Äôs easy to bleed on a page,  
When your heart feels like an open wound.

But tonight,  
I don‚Äôt want easy.  
I want celebration.  
I want to thank myself,  
For always finding a way back,  
To me.

For never giving up hope,  
That I will become the woman I strive to be,  
One day.  
While also being thankful for the woman I currently am.  
Far from perfect,  
But still rare and beautiful,  
like a flower breaking through concrete.  
That strength,  
That resilience,  
Is far more breathtaking,  
Than any pretty face in a magazine.

I want to celebrate my heart,  
For staying pure,  
For staying soft,  
For refusing to hold any space for revenge or anger,  
No matter how many storms tried to harden it.

They say I‚Äôm too kind for my own good,  
But I‚Äôll never apologise for being the light in the dark.  
Even when the dark bites back,  
And it often does.

I want to celebrate the small wins,  
Because each one is one step closer to that finish line.

Celebrate how good it feels,  
To see my own reflection and recognise the woman smiling back.  
The way she carries her own joy,  
The way she can confidently say ‚Äú I look really pretty ‚Äú,  
Even without an ounce of makeup on.¬†

I want to write about hope,  
How it still lives in my chest like a stubborn flame,  
And how every time I choose myself,  
It burns a little brighter.  
Every inch of me that heals and grows,  
Is one inch closer to my happily ever after,  
That I know I deserve.  
That I know will fall into place,  
When I‚Äôm finally ready to accept it.¬†

I want to talk about joy,  
That quiet, stubborn kind That sneaks up on you in the middle of making coffee,  
That makes you dance around your kitchen feeling so free.  
The joy that makes you have to take an extra deep breath,  
While you‚Äôre screaming a song in your car with the windows down,  
Unable to wipe the smile off your face,  
Envisioning your future self,  
Living the life you know will come true.  
The life you deserve,  
Full happiness, Confidence and love.

This is the part they don‚Äôt tell you about healing,  
That healing isn‚Äôt loud.  
It‚Äôs not fireworks or applause.  
It‚Äôs the whisper of keeping promises to yourself.  
It‚Äôs continuing to show up for yourself,  
Every. Single. Day.  
Because you know ***YOU‚ÄôRE*** worth it!

So tonight I honour the woman I am today,  
Strong,  
Confident,  
Driven,  
Kind,  
Beautiful both inside and out.

To the girl who smiles at strangers,  
Crumbles at every animal she comes across,  
And says a little prayer anytime she hears an emergency vehicle,  
Never stop being you.  
Many will say you need a stronger back bone,  
Many will say this level of kindness is a weakness,  
Delusional,  
But how ***beautiful*** it is to see the world through your eyes,  
To see the potential this world would have if more of us were genuinely kind.

She‚Äôs back,  
She‚Äôs happy,  
And she knows she‚Äôs on the right path,  
That will lead her to everything she ever wanted in this world.  
Love.  
First with herself,  
Then with her person.

She‚Äôs back,  
She‚Äôs proud,  
And she‚Äôs forever striving for better.  
Because she knows what she‚Äôs capable of,  
And she's coming for the win this time.",1,1752713859.0,u_Pure_Intentions_,0,1.0,False

Which stores are spending right now in my category?
Who‚Äôs most likely to respond and actually buy?
but my list was just... a spreadsheet. 10,000 rows of guesses.

If you can‚Äôt segment based on things like whether they‚Äôre open, active, or have a buyer listed, you‚Äôre flying blind. I wasted so much time emailing closed businesses or dead inboxes.

Here‚Äôs what helped me narrow it down:

I started filtering based on annual revenue or order volume
I only kept leads where I could find a real decision-maker for my lead gen, not just ‚Äúinfo@‚Äù
I separated multi-location chains from single-location mom-and-pop shops
I looked at Google review trends; if they‚Äôre growing, they‚Äôre alive

I‚Äôve never had my IQ tested, but I can read an comprehend ~800WPM.  I think I‚Äôm an autistic too because I‚Äôm hyper focused on psychology, likely because of the decades of trauma I endured.  

In the first couple of days meeting you I detected you fell into the dark triad and overtly love bombed me.  I saw what you were doing..creating a bond, making me love you, being perfect in every way while idealizing my faults.  I enjoyed the sex, the gifts and drawing out the love bombing stage by being a little reluctant.

I was so bummed when the devaluing started as I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be long until the discard.  I threw you a bone‚Ä¶my wife actually came up with it.  Where I convinced you we were having marriage problems and I was vulnerable‚Ä¶you were entertainment for us.

For weeks you believed you were making progress.  It looked like you had successfully sabotaged and destroyed a family of 25 years.  Pshh, we are the opposite of everything you know.  Every night during our smoke session, you were discussed, mocked and laughed about.   You thought I was prey, but you found me too late.  I‚Äôd been the prey before and when she was done with me I became on expert.  I literally control your actions, pulling strings on your subconscious.  My displays of vulnerability were all calculated.  Just like you, nothing I said was sincere.  

I loved frustrating you when you‚Äôd start using silent treatment, triangulation and blame shifting.  You wanted me to be mad or hurt so fucking bad, but I wouldn‚Äôt let you have the satisfaction.  I kept you Hoover, never giving you enough ‚Äúsupply‚Äù to feel satisfied.  You‚Äôre use to be the dealer and getting picked hooked, but I reversed the rolls.  You were addicted to chasing a response out of me.  Confused when my words didn‚Äôt align with my feelings.   

I have hated you this entire time.  You are the representation of the most evil and destructive personality on earth.  Have you seen the thousands of survivor groups around the world?  People so broken they will never love or trust again.  I was fortunate..I was wounded deeply but completely recovered back to a secure attachment.  Life is good.  I‚Äôm actually an empath, but feel nothing for you.  I justify everything I‚Äôm doing with the fact that there are so many victims spared because I‚Äôm occupying your time.  However, I genuinely enjoy your anguish.  

Shouldn‚Äôt have shared your location ‚Ä¶.when you went up north I shared with some friends about your home.  I didn‚Äôt plan, profit or know what was going to happen.  I knew they‚Äôd probably take the opportunity.  Sorry, but I was laughing inside while you weeped.  

Your coworkers, family, friends..all them I was discretely causing you problems‚Ä¶shouldn‚Äôt have left your computer here with my son..Yaaaa. That‚Äôs how everyone started discovering all the lies you told.

I watched as you had to change the setting on your social media and your world was collapsing.  You thought I was your confidant..beyond funny.   Your shop closed after I outed you to your clients.   

You‚Äôd buy me coffee and rub my back while ‚Äúwe‚Äù tried to investigate and figure how these people knew so much.

I used the fact that narcissists think they are better and entitled.  You couldn‚Äôt see how you isolated your self with the devil..you saw a text pop up in the truck, you pretended not to notice.  I‚Äôve been revealed now, but it‚Äôs too late.  You‚Äôre completely fucked and realizing your supply was fake and not available.


I‚Äôm so impatient‚Ä¶this is the first time in a long time that I can‚Äôt accurately predict what you will do next.   I want to thank you‚Ä¶there was a bitterness in my blood that you helped with bloodletting.  I feel better, like the poison is gone.

1m1tujg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m1tujg/aita_for_not_inviting_a_colleague_to_my_wedding/,AITA for not inviting a colleague to my wedding?,"Hi! I‚Äôve never posted before only ever been a lurker in this subreddit but I need some validation that I‚Äôm not the AH here, or some clarity that I am the AH.

I (29F) am getting married this November. We sent out invites in late May with an RSVP deadline of July 30. Just for context, the dinner cards include a note to contact me or my fianc√© directly for vegetarian options.

I‚Äôve worked at my current company since I graduated from college, and I genuinely love it. It‚Äôs a small office about 20 people and I get along with everyone professionally. That said, I‚Äôm only actually close friends with two coworkers, Cindy (32F) and Ben (32M). I was a bridesmaid in Cindy‚Äôs wedding a few years ago, and I‚Äôm officiating Ben‚Äôs wedding next year.

Only Cindy and Ben were invited to my wedding. The rest of the office knows I‚Äôm getting married, but again it‚Äôs a very small event (about 30 people total), and I‚Äôve only invited people I consider close friends.

Here‚Äôs the issue.

Last week, Cindy and I were on our lunch break (off the clock) and she brought up wanting to switch to the vegetarian entr√©e. I gave her a quick explanation of the dish, and the conversation drifted to some other wedding details. Lisa (49F), a coworker, happened to overhear us and interrupted to say, ‚ÄúWell, I haven‚Äôt gotten my invite!‚Äù and laughed. Cindy and I laughed too, thinking it was a joke, but I replied plainly but not rudely, ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt sent one.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt sure if she was joking, but I just wanted to be clear so there was no confusion later. She made a face and walked away without another word. I honestly didn‚Äôt think anything of it as I‚Äôve never hung out with Lisa outside of work (ever), and I wouldn‚Äôt expect an invite to her wedding if roles were reversed.

Later that same day, as I was leaving, Lisa stopped me and asked again if she was really not invited. I confirmed that she wasn‚Äôt. I explained the wedding is small (30 guests max), and it‚Äôs in California while we live in New Mexico. She told me she was incredibly disappointed in me and said she had always viewed me as a mentee and helped ‚Äúshape my career‚Äù.

I corrected her and told her that wasn‚Äôt accurate. She helped train me for maybe a week when I started, then switched departments entirely. We barely interact now and she works on the other side of the office. My actual team lead, who I actually see as a mentor to me, wasn‚Äôt invited either. I reminded her again that the wedding was small and she wasn‚Äôt invited.

After that, she started giving me death stares every time we passed each other, which is whatever. I don‚Äôt care what a 50-year-old woman thinks about my wedding guest list.

A few days later, in my 1:1 with my boss, he brought up the ‚Äúincident‚Äù and asked for my side of the story. I explained everything that the conversation started on my own time during lunch, and that it wasn‚Äôt work-related. I don‚Äôt even talk about my wedding much at work. I didn‚Äôt wear an engagement ring, so most people didn‚Äôt even know I was engaged until they saw I took two weeks off in November for the wedding/honeymoon on our shared calendar.

My boss told me just to be ‚Äúmindful‚Äù in case others felt left out. I said I‚Äôd continue working professionally but I‚Äôm not responsible for how others feel about my personal life. He shrugged and said ‚Äúokay.‚Äù

Later that same day, another coworker came up and asked if she was invited to the wedding. I said no. She said she figured, but then mentioned Lisa had been telling people she was trying to get the staff invites to the wedding. Apparently Lisa even told her she went to our boss to complain it was unfair that only two coworkers were invited.

I told that coworker and the others who asked me in the days following that no, they were not invited, and if Lisa continued to talk about my wedding, they could direct her to me. Most of them seemed to understand, but they all confirmed Lisa was still upset.

I truly don‚Äôt understand this. Why does she think she can strong-arm me into inviting her? Why does she think she‚Äôs entitled to a spot at my wedding? 

This just feels like such a non-issue to me. I‚Äôve only ever been to three weddings in my whole life. Not once have I seen someone invite their entire office. Is that actually a thing people do? I didn‚Äôt think it was common practice to invite coworkers unless you‚Äôre genuinely friends with them. And again, I‚Äôve never hung out with Lisa outside of work. I don‚Äôt talk to her unless it‚Äôs work-related. So I‚Äôm completely thrown off by how upset she is, like I committed some social crime by not inviting someone I barely know to a wedding with 30 guests.

Here‚Äôs where I might be the AH.

One morning I was putting my lunch away, and Lisa walked in to get coffee. I stopped her and said if she had any issues with me or my wedding, she could talk to me directly ‚Äî not the rest of the office. I also told her again that she is not invited and never was, regardless of who she tried to complain to.

She started crying and said she didn‚Äôt understand why I was being so mean that she‚Äôs only ever been nice to me. I couldn‚Äôt believe the crocodile tears, so I laughed at her and walked away.

In the first week since publishing,¬†[*Beyond Slides: Stand out, become irreplaceable, and win big in consulting*](https://mybook.to/hbwgyr)¬†hit¬†**#1 Best Seller on Amazon**¬†in the ‚ÄúConsulting‚Äù and ‚ÄúBusiness Consulting‚Äù categories in the USA, UK, Australia, and Italy.  
  
It feels surreal!  
  
In 2023, my dad passed away from cancer. Just weeks earlier, he had finally published his first book: a collection of poems and short stories he had tinkered with for 30 years.  
  
His official bio mentioned that was his debut, but I know that, for decades, those pages floated around the house, handwritten, typed, edited, re-edited, abandoned, resurrected.  
  
He always thought he would finish it one day, but life got in the way.  
  
*Or maybe fear did.*  
  
When he finally made it, time had nearly run out, and that hit me harder than I expected. That made me realize that ‚Äúone day‚Äù is a dangerous idea.  
  
So I started writing, and after 24 months of early mornings, late nights, and a lot of caffeine,¬†[*Beyond Slides*](https://mybook.to/hbwgyr)¬†is out.

[\\""Beyond Slides\\"" is available in both digital and paperback format](https://preview.redd.it/69hqgp3kzbdf1.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&s=565c5869dd1693829bba8a57fd5d163e0fc4dc0f)

**Part philosophical essay, part memoir, part survival manual, this useful book includes 39 practical exercises** for those trying to make sense of this strange and slippery profession: if you are a consultant (or love one, manage one, work with one, are married to one) this might be worth your time.

**Huge thanks to**¬†[**Tom Goodwin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAABiLAUBdX88ZN_tZ2oFSXrO56yUUby-l1w)¬†**for writing the foreword!** Having someone with such a sharp, curious, and delightfully contrarian mind introduce the book to you all is a true honor.

**The best testimonials** are always from others, so let me share some of the comments I received from readers:

>*Think of*¬†Beyond Slides¬†*as Anthony Bourdain‚Äôs*¬†Kitchen Confidential¬†*but about the opaque industry that is management consulting. Maurizio makes the industry and its characters come alive, packing a punch both in the stories and practical exercises for consultants wanna-bes. You will come away utterly convinced you have the skills and confidence to be a consultant!*



>*Maurizio has captured timeless insights from his years of on-the-ground experience in*¬†Beyond Slides*. This book is an excellent reference for young consultants, who often lack direction and guidance in the fast-paced, high-performance world of consulting. It also serves as a reminder and a reflection for senior executives. What I enjoyed most was the consistent embedding of philosophy, alongside the unmistakable Ancient Roman and Italian flavour you would expect from the author. Highly recommended.*



>Beyond Slides¬†*by Maurizio Cuna is a standout: a witty, deeply practical guide that reveals the real secrets to thriving in consulting. Cuna, drawing from rich global experience, convincingly argues that true irreplaceability comes from mastering the human element and soft skills, not just polished decks. With actionable exercises and compelling storytelling, this is an indispensable resource for everyone from new joiners to seasoned pros seeking to elevate their game and build a lasting career. A must read.*



>*What sets this book apart is its brutal honesty and clarity. Unlike the usual consulting career guides that are filled with fluff and buzzwords, this one gets straight to the point. It‚Äôs written in a style that‚Äôs refreshingly direct, almost like getting advice from a sharp, experienced colleague over coffee. Having spent years in IT consulting and sales myself, I found it not only accurate but also incredibly insightful. It captures the actual dynamics of our profession: the pressure, the politics, the growth, and the grind. A must-read for anyone who wants a realistic look at what it takes to build a sustainable and rewarding career in consulting.*



>*I picked up* Beyond Slides *looking for actionable advice on building a consulting career, and Maurizio Cuna absolutely delivers. This book is packed with practical insights that go well beyond the typical theoretical career advice you find elsewhere.* 

>*What really sets this book apart is Cuna's writing style - it's incredibly easy to follow and feels like having a conversation with an experienced mentor. Rather than dry theories, he shares real-life experiences from his consulting journey, which makes the advice feel authentic and immediately applicable.*

And many more...

Tanya was already perched on the bed, a comfortable, familiar smile on her face. ‚ÄúGot everything?‚Äù she asked, patting the duvet beside her.

‚ÄúAll set,‚Äù Ela replied, dropping her bag with a thud. They quickly settled in for the night, the evening light giving way to the soft glow of the lamp. They watched ‚ÄúAnnie,‚Äù a classic that always brought a smile to their faces. Soon, voices blended, hesitant at first, then gaining confidence as they sang along to ""Maybe,"" a hopeful anthem echoing softly in the hotel room. Laughter bubbled up, light and easy, a testament to their rekindled bond. Eventually, exhaustion claimed them, and they drifted off to sleep, a comfortable silence descending.

The next morning, the first rays of California sun filtered through the curtains, stirring them awake. As soon as Ela‚Äôs eyes fluttered open, a tell-tale tickle began in her nose. A-BZZZZZEESSXXSCHOO! Five times in a row, each getting stronger and more wet and spray. Five rapid-fire sneezes erupted. The air instantly filled with a peculiar, potent aroma ‚Äì a distinct mix of honey, a faint tang of morning breath, and the unmistakable, slightly damp scent of a fresh sneeze and old spit.

Tanya, still half-asleep, stirred. Her nose crinkled, then she let out a soft chuckle. ‚ÄúGod, I‚Äôd forgotten that smell,‚Äù she mumbled, pulling a pillow over her head briefly before peeking out. ‚ÄúMissed your sneeze scent, you know.‚Äù

Ela, still in her rumpled pajamas, blushed slightly but smiled. It was an odd thing to miss, but it was their odd thing. They spent a few minutes stretching, groggily getting ready, and then headed down the elevators to the hotel‚Äôs bustling breakfast area. Fueled by coffee and pastries, they went back upstairs to grab some things.

Their next destination was LA, and an Uber whisked them to the Metrolink station. The train was already waiting when they arrived, a long, silver serpent ready to glide through the Californian landscape. They found a pair of seats, settling in comfortably, and soon, the train began to move.

A friendly voice broke their contemplation. ‚ÄúMind if I join you ladies?‚Äù A guy, probably in his late twenties, with bright, inquisitive eyes and a genuinely warm smile, gestured to the empty seat beside Ela. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Mitch,‚Äù he offered, extending a hand.

‚ÄúEla,‚Äù she replied, shaking his hand.

‚ÄúTanya,‚Äù her friend added, nodding.

Mitch settled in. ‚ÄúSo, where are you two headed?‚Äù

‚ÄúLA,‚Äù Tanya said. ‚ÄúVisiting for a few days.‚Äù

‚ÄúCool, me too,‚Äù Mitch grinned. ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù

‚ÄúStoke-on-Trent,‚Äù Ela replied, anticipating the blank look.

But Mitch‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúNo way! Stoke-on-Trent! That‚Äôs fascinating! How do you end up from Stoke-on-Trent to LA? That‚Äôs quite the journey.‚Äù He seemed genuinely intrigued, a smile playing on his lips.

‚ÄúWell, we just wanted a bit of an adventure,‚Äù Ela explained. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very different from home.‚Äù She then leaned forward. ‚ÄúSpeaking of which, any recommendations for LA? We‚Äôre open to anything.‚Äù

Mitch‚Äôs face lit up. ‚ÄúOh, absolutely! So much to see. You‚Äôve got the obvious stuff ‚Äì Hollywood Walk of Fame, Griffith Observatory for amazing views, Santa Monica Pier for the beach vibe. But definitely check out the Getty Center, the art and architecture are incredible. And if you like quirky, Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice is great for shops and food. Then there‚Äôs Universal Studios, if you‚Äôre into theme parks‚Ä¶‚Äù He rattled off suggestions with an infectious enthusiasm, clearly a seasoned LA explorer.

Ela listened, mentally jotting down notes. Then, out of curiosity, she asked, ‚ÄúHave you ever been to Dallas?‚Äù

The shift in Mitch‚Äôs demeanor was immediate and startling. His eyes, just moments ago sparkling with excitement, went wide with something akin to panic, a flash of fear mixed with profound disgust. He looked like a rabbit caught in a snake's gaze, but also as if he‚Äôd just stepped in something truly vile. His jaw tightened. ‚ÄúStay away,‚Äù he said, his voice barely audible. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ stay away from DFW. North Texas is the land without smiles.‚Äù

Ela blinked, surprised. ‚ÄúWhy? It looks like a nice metro area from the plane.‚Äù

Mitch shook his head, a shudder running through him. ‚ÄúIt may look nice,‚Äù he said, his voice rising slightly, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs truly terrible.‚Äù

Tanya, equally intrigued by his sudden intensity, pressed, ‚ÄúWhy? What‚Äôs so bad about it?‚Äù

Mitch‚Äôs expression hardened. ‚ÄúThe people,‚Äù he declared, his voice filled with venom. ‚ÄúI hate the people there. They‚Äôre all so miserable and unhappy. And they want you to be miserable too. I swear, the only time you see anyone happy at DFW Airport,‚Äù he scoffed, ‚Äúis when they‚Äôre about to leave the metroplex!‚Äù

He leaned forward, his voice dropping conspiratorially, as if sharing a dark secret. ‚ÄúAnd the drivers‚Ä¶ oh, God, the drivers are the worst. No one, and I mean no one, lets you into their lane. Ever. And they honk their horns for no reason at all. It‚Äôs like a sport for them. They‚Äôll intentionally try to clip your car, just so they can sue you! I almost got hit so many times.‚Äù His eyes welled up, and he suddenly choked back a sob. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Ä¶ someone even called me a really mean name once. A really, really mean name, totally unprovoked.‚Äù He wiped at his eyes frantically. ‚ÄúThe people there are just so rude and vile. It‚Äôs cultural, I swear. It‚Äôs just how they are.‚Äù

Tanya tried to interject gently. ‚ÄúOh, really? That‚Äôs so strange. I had a really nice lady tell me ‚Äòbless you‚Äô at DFW airport.‚Äù

Mitch snorted, recovering slightly. ‚ÄúThat lady wasn‚Äôt from there,‚Äù he said dismissively. ‚ÄúAnd she was probably happy because she was finally flying out! I‚Äôm telling you, LA is so much friendlier. No stuck-up or mean people here. If you want to visit Texas, go to Houston. You‚Äôll have a much better time there. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find true Texas hospitality.‚Äù He paused, then added, ‚ÄúDFW has more hostility than Boston, I swear.‚Äù

Just then, Ela felt another familiar tickle. A-BZZZXZHXHOUU! she sneezed.

‚ÄúBless you,‚Äù Mitch said automatically, though his eyes narrowed slightly.

She sneezed again, even more forcefully this time. The honey-morning-breath-spit aroma wafted through the air, stronger now.

Mitch‚Äôs nose twitched. He started sniffing, a faint look of distress on his face. He sniffed again, subtly. He then stood up abruptly. ‚ÄúYou know what,‚Äù he said, forcing a smile, ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll just‚Ä¶ stretch my legs in the next row.‚Äù He moved two rows back, still talking, though his voice was a little more strained. He clearly did not like the smell of Ela‚Äôs spitty sneeze.

Ela and Tanya exchanged amused glances, barely suppressing giggles. They watched Mitch continue his animated monologue from a safer distance, occasionally glancing back at them.

Eventually, the Metrolink pulled into Union Station, a grand, historic building bustling with activity. Mitch reappeared, seemingly having forgotten his olfactory offense. ‚ÄúWell, this is my stop too!‚Äù he chirped, a wide smile back on his face. ‚ÄúMind if I tag along for a bit? I can show you the best way to get around downtown.‚Äù

Ela and Tanya looked at each other, a silent conversation passing between them. He was intense, a little dramatic, but undeniably friendly and full of useful information. ‚ÄúSure, Mitch,‚Äù Ela said, as they stepped off the train. ‚ÄúThat would be great.‚Äù The adventure in LA, it seemed, was just getting started.",3,1752713181.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1m1toqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m1toqf/the_one_who_remembered/,The One Who Remembered -,"*A weird tree appears outside of Gideon's house, memory horror ensues*

I woke to birdsong and the smell of earth after rain. One of those soft mornings where the world feels like it might forgive you, just for being awake.

But I knew before I opened my eyes that something had changed.

There was a pressure in the room. Not sound. Not motion. Just... weight. Like a thought too loud to ignore.

I sat up, rubbed my neck, and looked out the bedroom window.

And there it was.

A tree. Standing tall in my backyard. A shape that hadn‚Äôt been there yesterday.

I threw on my boots and stepped into the dew-wet grass. The earth was cold and quiet.

The tree loomed, maybe thirty feet tall, with bark the color of char and limbs like claws reaching skyward. No leaves. No fruit. Just stark, broken branches against the pale sky.

It looked ancient. But it hadn‚Äôt been there the day before.

I walked a slow circle around it. The roots jutted out like ribs beneath the soil, gnarled and exposed. One of them had cracked the stepping stone path.

The thing felt wrong. But not like danger. More like judgment.

‚ÄúMorning, Gideon.‚Äù

I turned. Mrs. Daley stood across the fence, arms full of her morning paper.

‚ÄúYou see this?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI did. Thought maybe you planted it while we were sleeping.‚Äù She chuckled, but her voice had that edge folks get when they‚Äôre pretending something isn‚Äôt bothering them.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt just showed up.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt say anything after that. Just went inside.

My wife, June, lingered in the doorway. She stared at the tree for a long moment before returning inside.

At the market, people started whispering.

‚ÄúTree came up overnight, I heard.‚Äù  
‚ÄúOn Ross‚Äôs property, of all places.‚Äù  
‚ÄúBurned. Black. Omen stuff.‚Äù

By the time I made it to the tomatoes, Father Havel intercepted me.

‚ÄúYou ought to bless it. Or burn it,‚Äù he said, eyes flicking like he couldn‚Äôt quite meet mine. ‚ÄúThings that arrive uninvited usually don‚Äôt leave kindly.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep that in mind.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt bless it. Or burn it.  
Didn‚Äôt even touch it again.  
But that night, as I watched it through the kitchen window, I whispered aloud:

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt fear you.‚Äù

And somewhere deep in its bark, I swear I heard it creak. 

Our dog, Rufus, went missing three days later.

No holes in the fence. No sign of struggle. Just his collar at the base of the tree. Still buckled. 

June clutched it to her chest. Her hands trembled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs watching us.‚Äù

I said nothing. I wanted to believe we still had control of our lives.

That night, she doubled over in bed, clutching her stomach in pain. No fever. No rash. Just a twisting inside her that the doctors couldn‚Äôt explain.

It started there.

Then came the fatigue. She could barely stand without gripping the walls. Her skin went pale and papery, veins darkening like bruises beneath the surface. Her voice grew thin, fraying at the edges. She‚Äôd start sentences and forget where they were going. Names slipped her memory. Then whole days.

She stopped going outside. Light hurt her eyes. Smells made her gag. Food lost all flavor.

By the second week, she could no longer dress herself. I bathed her, fed her, held her hair back when she coughed bile into the sink. I carried her to bed, bones pressing through skin that had once been warm.

The worst part was the look in her eyes. Not fear. Not confusion.

Resignation. 

The tree grew taller. Its branches scraped the clouds.

One night, I snapped.

I grabbed the old gas can from the shed and splashed it across the bark, shaking with rage, with grief, with a helplessness so deep it felt like drowning.

I struck the match and threw it.

The flame caught the grass. The roots. But when it reached the trunk... 

Nothing.

The fire climbed an inch, then died. The bark remained untouched. Not blackened. Not scorched. The flames refused to cling to it, like the tree rejected the laws of nature.

I tried again. And again.

The matches crumbled in my hands. The lighter sparked and died. Even the wind stood still, as if holding its breath.

I screamed at it. I cursed. I wept.

The tree didn‚Äôt move.

But I could feel it watching.

My garden died.

Lettuce rotted in the soil. Tomatoes blackened at the root. I dug through the dirt and touched something slick and pulsing: a root not mine. It shifted when I pressed it.

I stepped back. My hands were shaking. I wiped them on my jeans like it would help.

That night, June asked in her sleep:

‚ÄúWhat do we do?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt sleep at all.

The sound didn‚Äôt start loud. Like a finger scraping inside of my ear. Not a noise, exactly. A presence. A pressure.

Then, the scraping.

Slow. Intentional.

It dragged across the siding like a bone against stone.

June woke with a gasp, hands to her ears.

I ran to the window.

A branch was brushing against the side of the house. It was too close. A gash had formed in the siding, where it had left its mark.

I‚Äôd measured that space a dozen times. The closest branch was yards away. Now the limb bent, like something testing a joint, and trembled slightly as if excited.

I stepped back from the window.

And the scraping returned, faster than before.

June cried out again. Blood leaked from her nose. She clutched her head and whispered.

‚ÄúMake it stop. Please, Gideon, it‚Äôs in my thoughts‚Äî‚Äù

The branch tapped the glass.

It twisted before my eyes, the ends of the branch splaying into fingerlike tips as it tapped again.

I closed the curtains.

The sound stopped.

Then started again‚Äîinside.

A soft dragging along the hallway wall. I turned, throwing the bedroom door open. Nothing.

But the wallpaper peeled, curling away from something beneath the surface.

The walls converged, forming a wooden frame. Inside, the hallway was mirrored. I saw myself and the bedroom behind me.

June was laying still in the bed, limbs splayed. Her head rose slowly, an orange sap leaking from her eyes.

I stiffened, staring at her reflection.

‚ÄúJune?‚Äù

June‚Äôs body arched. Her torso rose and dragged the rest of her along.

‚ÄúJune!‚Äù I turned, her name a scream on my tongue.

But June was sitting in bed, staring at me. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

I turned again, expecting to find her reflection hovering in the air. Instead, I saw the hallway again.

The wallpaper was torn open, peeling to the floor. In its place, something wet oozed down the exposed wall.

I reached to wipe it and my fingers came away sticky.

Sap.

It smelled like peppermint, hospital soap, garden soil, and June‚Äôs shampoo. Scents folded over each other unnaturally. I staggered back, wiping my hand on my pants.

Behind me, June whispered.

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù

I returned to bed.

The next morning, I found the tree bent. It grew and curved, its branches descending around the house like a cage. They dug into the earth, surely binding together beneath our feet.

Two thick branches framed the front door. I didn‚Äôt dare pass through them. Sometimes, between them, I saw myself staring back.

June stopped eating. Her voice thinned to a whisper. I read to her, old books we loved. She barely blinked. Once, I caught her staring at the ceiling for over an hour, her lips moving without sound.

‚ÄúDo you hear it when it scratches?‚Äù she asked one evening.

‚ÄúEvery night,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúIt wants us to forget,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúBut it won‚Äôt let us forget the wrong things. Only the things that matter.‚Äù

That night, she gripped my hand, looked straight at me, and said:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a tree.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúA witness.‚Äù

We sat in silence for a long time, the only sound the ticking of the kitchen clock. Then June turned her head toward the window.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù she whispered.

I followed her gaze.

There, just beyond the glass, a small shape dangled from one of the nearest branches‚Äîa mirror, teardrop-shaped, catching no light, showing no reflection. It swung gently, though there was no breeze.

I stood slowly, walking toward the window.

But as I reached for the glass, the mirror was gone. No sound. No shimmer. 

June was still staring.

‚ÄúIt remembers,‚Äù she said, almost inaudibly. ‚ÄúIt knows when we see it.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt speak again for the rest of the night.

The next morning, she was still in her chair by the window, wrapped in the quilt her mother had made. Her eyes were open, cloudy with thought.

I brought her tea. She didn‚Äôt drink it.

‚ÄúJune,‚Äù I said softly, kneeling beside her. ‚ÄúDo you know who I am?‚Äù

She blinked slowly. Her lips parted, but no sound came.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to stop it,‚Äù I whispered.

A pause. I didn‚Äôt breathe.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look away, Gideon.‚Äù 

I nodded, breath held and eyes locked on hers. Her hand in mine felt thin, like paper.

‚ÄúIf you look away‚Ä¶‚Äù she coughed up something gray, like dust. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I won‚Äôt be here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt look away.‚Äù

The air changed.

A silence fell, heavy and voidlike. The moment between a noise and the world‚Äôs choice to echo it.

The house creaked, branches shifted against the windows.

The shadows on the wall flickered‚Äîand reversed direction. The dust in the air spiraled upward.

June‚Äôs face stuttered.

For a moment, it wasn‚Äôt her. Her face was blank, scarred skin stretched over her features.

Then, it snapped back and she looked at me. Terrified.

‚ÄúGideon, I‚Äî‚Äù

I blinked.

And she was gone.

No weight in my palm. No warmth. No noise.

Just emptiness.

Where she had been, the chair was unoccupied. The quilt lay folded perfectly, untouched. A crack formed in the wood of the floor beneath it.

I stopped counting the days after she disappeared.

Or maybe I never started.

There was no calendar. No clock. Not anymore. The walls had warped. Doorframes leaned. Light came in at wrong angles. Sometimes sunset bled through the ceiling at noon.

The pantry led to the basement. The attic led to nowhere.

I tried to write her name on the walls.

It disappeared before the ink dried.

I carved it into the floorboards‚ÄîJUNE, over and over, gouged deep with the broken handle of a soup spoon. But the next morning the grooves had filled. The floor was smooth. Like memory itself had scabbed over.

I whispered her name at night. Into closets. Into vents. Into my own skin.

‚ÄúJune. June. June.‚Äù

But it tasted sour now. Like a name I‚Äôd read once in a book I no longer owned.

The house began to misbehave.

Lights blinked in patterns. The faucet dripped upward. The fridge was empty, but hummed out melodies I recognized. I heard someone laugh in the hallway‚Äîher laugh‚Äîbut when I turned, it was the tree outside the window, its branches swaying in windless air.

I stopped sleeping.

I‚Äôd lie on the couch, blankets wrapped around my bony frame. Sometimes I‚Äôd see her silhouette in the reflection of the TV‚Äîsitting beside me, curled in her quilt, breathing softly.

When I turned to look, she was never there.

I went days without speaking.

Then I began talking to myself.

‚ÄúShe liked sunflowers.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThe coffee... she hated bitter coffee.‚Äù  
‚ÄúHer hands smelled like rosemary.‚Äù  
‚ÄúShe... she... she...‚Äù

Each time, the next word got harder to find.

My mouth fought the shape of her.

The photographs changed.

At first, they were fine.

Then her face blurred.  
Then she wasn‚Äôt in them.  
Then they were blank.  
Glossy rectangles. Light reflecting off nothing.

I pulled one from the wall and screamed. Not because she was gone‚Äîbut because I didn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd expected to see.

It scared me, how fast it was slipping.  
How fast she was becoming a theory.  
A myth I had once believed in.

I wrote her name on scraps of paper. I folded them into her coat pockets. I put one inside a sugar jar. I taped one to the ceiling.

They vanished.

Every morning, I searched the house like a man hunting for God. I dug through the trash. I opened the walls.

Nothing.

Just dust. And silence. And that low, bone-deep humming‚Äîlike the tree was watching me from inside the drywall.

One night, I fell to my knees in the center of the living room.

‚ÄúI remember her,‚Äù I said aloud. ‚ÄúEven if you don‚Äôt. Even if no one does. I remember her!‚Äù

The walls didn‚Äôt answer.

The ceiling flickered. The lightbulb above me pulsed‚Äîonce, twice, like a heartbeat.  
Then the power died.

I sat in the dark.

My mouth was dry.

And for the first time since she vanished, I couldn‚Äôt remember her laugh.

I stood in the hallway, gripping the doorknob to the bedroom.

I had something to say.

Something important.

But I didn‚Äôt know what it was.

I opened my mouth and nothing came out. Not even a sound.

The tree‚Äôs shadow fell across the hallway.

I stared at it.

And for a long, shivering moment‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt remember why I was afraid.

They came to my yard just before dusk. The tree hadn‚Äôt moved since it encased the house.

Five of them‚Äîneighbors, old friends, the kind who used to lend sugar and share holidays. Now their faces were wrong. Too still. Their eyes fixed on something far behind me and I was just a shape in their way.

‚ÄúGideon,‚Äù said Mark Breyer, my former pastor, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre worried about you. This thing‚Äîit‚Äôs all you talk about. Trees don‚Äôt just appear. Maybe you need rest. Maybe you need help.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy wife is gone,‚Äù I said, lingering in the doorway.

My neighbor, Janine, looked at me with something like fear in her eyes. ‚ÄúYou never had a wife. You‚Äôve been alone since college. Everyone knows that.‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs hand twitched at his side, like he was rehearsing a gesture he couldn‚Äôt quite remember. Janine‚Äôs smile stiffened, her cheeks curling like the edges of paper touched by flame.

‚ÄúWe just want what‚Äôs best for you,‚Äù Janine said. ‚ÄúYou need to forget.‚Äù

I looked from face to face, searching for one spark of memory, one crack in the lie. There was none.

Their laughter came too late, too rehearsed. Cold. Like something mimicking human behavior.

After they left, the world tilted.

I stopped speaking.

And then, I began to forget.

Not all at once. Not like a clean cut. More like erosion‚Äîgrain by grain.

First, I couldn‚Äôt remember the sound of her laugh. Then her voice. Then the shape of her hands. I stared at old photos, but the faces blurred, or worse‚Äîshe wasn‚Äôt in them at all.

I panicked. Tore through the house looking for something‚Äîanything‚Äîwith her name on it. Her signature. Her scent. Her handwriting.

Gone. All gone.

All that remained was the shape of her in my mind‚Äîa feeling, a warmth, the imprint of love. A presence like the echo of a song I could no longer hum.

She became a concept. An ache. A wordless truth I couldn‚Äôt prove, but wouldn‚Äôt let go.

That was all I had.

And then, on the forty-ninth night, the mirror appeared.

A teardrop, smooth and colorless, hanging in the doorway. It reflected nothing. But I saw everything.

When I touched it, the world peeled away.

I stood beneath the soil, suspended in a place that was not time.

And time stretched.

It did not pass in hours or days. It passed in ache. In weight. In repetition. I walked without moving. I screamed without sound. I prayed without words.

I was watched.

Every breath I took, I felt something studying me‚Äînot out of curiosity or cruelty, but indifference. The same way the sky watches the ant.

The roots pulsed with thought. Thoughts that slipped into my own. I forgot where I ended. I forgot what I had been.

And I couldn‚Äôt remember why I had come. I knew there was someone. Someone important. A warmth. A concept I had clung to in a house that didn‚Äôt want to remember.

I wept. I tore at the roots. I begged the things beyond them.

And then‚Äî

A flicker.

A sound in my head, like glass catching sunlight.

A name.

June.

It returned like breath to drowning lungs. I saw her eyes, her hands, the curve of her shoulder in the morning light. I remembered the wordless shape she left in the bed.

I screamed her name.

The mirrors around me quaked.

The beings noticed. Their attention turned fully, all at once. It scorched.

""He names what was erased.""

I saw my own mirror blooming from a twisted root. I was there, kneeling before the base of the tree.

I reached for it and it shattered.

The tree screamed.

I climbed from the dirt before the tree, hands torn, skin raw.

I was back in my yard. 

The tree moved, creaking as its branches slipped from the earth around the house. Slowly, it righted itself.

I found the old gas can in the shed and staggered back to the tree.

The tree had completely straightened, standing impossibly tall.

I drenched the roots in gasoline, hands trembling.

What if this was the last thing tethering me to her?

What if the tree was the only reason I remembered at all?

No.

She wasn‚Äôt in the roots. She wasn‚Äôt in the bark.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to keep her.‚Äù

I struck the match.

The flames leapt high. The bark cracked open like ribs. The wind didn‚Äôt move, but the fire danced anyway. The air around me shimmered with heat, but I felt nothing on my skin.

All around, the world seemed to hold its breath. Even the insects had gone quiet.

And then‚Äîa voice.

Her. 

June‚Äôs voice. But not just hers. It was older. Woven with starlight. Holy.

‚ÄúGideon.‚Äù

I fell to my knees. The fire spread across the grass, but I didn‚Äôt feel it. My legs were washed over like a gentle tide, my pants peeling away and crumbling to dust. 

‚ÄúYou remembered me.‚Äù

I wept. ‚ÄúIs it really you?‚Äù

The flames grew brighter, and for a moment, I saw other figures in them‚Äîflickers of people I had never known. Their faces twisted with grief, their voices rising like smoke.

A great sigh moved through the air.

The tree split, and from its ruin poured ash, names, fragments of forgotten people.

I looked up, and her voice whispered:

‚ÄúYou were not alone.‚Äù

Then it was gone.

Nothing grows where my house once stood.

The grass never came back. The soil‚Äôs gone pale, like it‚Äôs still waiting for something to return. Maybe it always will.

I don‚Äôt visit every day. But when I do, I bring coffee in a chipped mug and sit on the edge of the field. I talk out loud sometimes. Not prayers‚Äîjust small things. Bits of memory.

‚ÄúJune hated bitter coffee.‚Äù  
‚ÄúJune loved rainy mornings.‚Äù  
‚ÄúJune would‚Äôve planted sunflowers here.‚Äù

The kids who live nearby say the place is haunted. Maybe it is. But not the way they think.

Some days, I see someone lingering at the fence line. No one ever comes close, but they watch. Curious. Like they feel something, even if they don‚Äôt know what it is.

That‚Äôs enough.

I don‚Äôt believe the world makes sense. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs fairness waiting at the end of things. But I believe in remembering. In saying her name. In passing it forward, even if no one understands why.

She was here.  
We were here.

And that still matters.

Maybe that‚Äôs all faith is.

1m1tnrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1m1tnrq/i_wish_i_knew_how_to_act_naturally_in_these/,I wish I knew how to act naturally in these moments,"I (35f) am coming out of a 14yr long marriage (17yrs together) and starting to date again. There was so much controlling behavior, some covert abuse, and overall it left me feeling like I was absolutely the problem. I am doing my absolute best to move forward fluidly, to go with the flow, after years of enduring such an emotionally devastating relationship (the only one to tend to the relationship/hold accountability/fix every one of my feelings alone). With the new-ish acknowledgement of the cptsd, I'm doing my best to give myself grace for not always having a normal response to situations. Occasionally, there are moments where my response is held into question and today I just want to cry because it triggered a memory from my last relationship that apparently still hurts. 

Lately, in this process of trying to date again, I am learning how to do this. I have kids. The person I am seeing has kids. We haven't really met the other's kids, but he works really close to the house. He wants to see me but we don't have a ton of time nor do I want him over at the house. But he'll call if he gets out of work early and ask to spend a little bit of time with me. Today, I just hopped in his car and we had no plans beyond that. I am in so much pain (low back/pinched nerve) and he knows this. I'm just quiet when often I am super chatty. But today between the pain and the audiobook I was reading when he called, I'm just in quiet mode. I still tried to initiate a little conversation, but he was quiet too. 

We grabbed some coffee at the gas station and he was quiet too. I poked and prodded enough that he finally said, ""I feel like I'm forcing you to hang out with me."" I basically told him that I'm doing my best to go with the flow, but there was no plan, no time to get ready, he knows I'm in pain. I then asked why he is basing his behavior on how I show up. Why am I expected to lead with charm and charisma all the time? I then told him, ""If you ask me to hang out last minute but this is how you feel when we hang out, please don't ask me out like this. If there's a way I can show up without you feeling like you have a hostage, then please let me know.""

Gut punch. He knows the story I referenced when I used the word ""hostage"" and I'm pretty certain it clicked something in his head because he apologized for bringing up a bad memory. I know he feels horrible now so the next few days are going to be a little tough. The bad memory was towards the end of my marriage, my husband said he wanted to take me out on a date all summer but hadn't. After I brought it up and the hurt behind it, he asked me to go on a coffee date one morning, on his day off. But either he told me the night before or he told me the morning of that he was going into work and would be back in time to take me out around 11:30am. He came home right about that time, I was finishing up dishes. He stood around waiting, never asking when we could go, if he could help me get out quicker, just no communication. 

I know at that point I was tired of all the communication, of anticipating every single thing and waiting around when he had a history of being late and him having to go into work on his day off meant I still had to manage the kids trip to school that morning, so I waited a bit as I casually finished my tasks. Then I was finally asked if I still wanted to go out for coffee. I said sure. We got in the car and he made such little effort to have a conversation with me. Did he want time with me? Was this all just obligation? I couldn't come up with anything to say. I was just hoping he'd take the lead since he asked me out on the ""date."" As we sat across from each other at the coffee shop, he told me he felt like he was holding me hostage. There was never any effort to make me feel welcome, but I still tried so hard to make a little conversation to show that while I was quiet I was open, but I just didn't feel like taking the lead on a date that was his idea. 

And now today, I am hit with that memory, and I just feel awful. Maybe it is me. Maybe I am supposed to act in a way that is more reassuring, though I thought I was doing that just not in an exaggerated way. I'd love to go on last minute dates while we try to squeeze in time together, but there's just something about my inability to show up at the last minute without feeling like I'm just so offputting. Am I supposed to behave a certain way here? Am I just around people who are trying to lean on me to lead with my energy? I don't know, but these little blips back to the past treatment where I felt like I was supposed to take the blame for the date being terrible kinda mess me up even more. 

I am proud of myself for not apologizing today for him feeling like he's pushing me to spend time with him that I don't want to. I'm proud of myself for stating that I'm in pain, I'm just quiet, but I need that not to be read as something being wrong. I'm not agreeing to do things I don't want to do. But why the hell is it my responsibility to set the tone entirely? But maybe I could still show up better??? I really don't know. I'm willing to take accountability but I'm so sick and tired of apologizing for things I shouldn't be taking accountability for. That last relationship (my marriage) truly exacerbated my ability to trust myself. I'm regaining it but it's so slow.

Either way, I'm putting an end to these last minute moments together because I don't think either one of us feels too good at the end of them. I'm not a cheap date anymore. If he wants time with me, he can plan ahead (he usually does) and that will be all for now. We're both learning how to be in a functional relationship and this time I'm with someone who does put in the effort to hear me and shift his behavior completely when we reach these strange little spots. I just think not doing last minute moments are going well right now and I'm gonna put a pin in them. ",2,1752713034.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

What do I do?,"Let‚Äôs start with the fact I am a Mosaic member and nobody was at the Mosaic desk the whole time I was at the airport. The people I dealt with from JetBlue from start to finish had a horrible attitude and seemed to hate their jobs. The flight kept getting delayed.. even while I was at my gate waiting. 

Now I am on the plane and the flight attendant handing out drinks was very unpleasant to myself, my brother, and my mother. We made a request for a coffee packet for my mom and the man responded with ‚ÄúI already passed by.‚Äù And walked away. He later came back with sugar and cream so I had to ask again and this time, the attitude was off the charts. He came around to pick up trash and we tidied everything up nicely for him to pick up. Well, I had my laptop open doing work and he decides to crush down the cups right over my pants/laptop. 

At this point, my lap is drenched and my laptop keyboard is almost fully wet. I quickly flip it over and when I look up, the man is gone. He came back with napkins and walked away. No apology, no acknowledgment, nothing but napkins. I rang the bell and luckily another flight attendant came to help. I told him the situation and he brought me surface cleaner but the other man (who spilled the drink on me) said he did not spill the drink on me and that it was my brothers fault for handing him stacked up cups. 

I told him that he did and to please not lie because it is making the situation worse especially after not offering any solution and just walking away. He replies ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôve been doing this 15 years and I guess I‚Äôm sorry for not saying sorry.‚Äù My mom told me to leave it and we could contact JetBlue after. My laptop would not turn on afterwards or even charge. This is the worse experience I‚Äôve ever had flying JetBlue. 

Today is Wednesday and my laptop STILL won‚Äôt turn on. Apple is quoting me 800+ dollars to fix this. It‚Äôs my only device that I can do school work on and I am beyond frustrated.

1m1tl7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1m1tl7q/new_relationship_ex_issues_help/,New relationship ex issues help!,"This is potentially quite long but let‚Äôs see, want to give as much context and background as possible‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve recently started seeing someone, I‚Äôm 35F it‚Äôs been a few months all is going well. I have one DS2 with no father involved. Been single since I was pregnant as obviously focused on my DS and wanted to make sure if I did start something in the future it was with somebody decent and have been very intolerant of any red flags or even any little thing. This is my first time dating since my DS. The person I‚Äôve started seeing isn‚Äôt a stranger it‚Äôs someone I‚Äôve known for a long time, 15+ years. Not a close friendship but think local area friends at one point but drift apart etc. He is 41M and has been married for over a decade but going through divorce as his ex had an affair (actually two affairs but he forgave the first, second it was over). They live apart and properly separated just the legal stuff isn‚Äôt yet finalised but in process. 

We see each other usually around once a week, sometimes a little more or less but that‚Äôs the average. I work full time and have my DS full time, he stays with his sister (on his dad‚Äôs side she‚Äôs in her 20s) one night a week. He has two DD, 5 and 4, he sees them every other weekend. He works away in the week most of the time and this has always been the case even when married, so now they have to split weekends. We have met each others children, not introduced as new partners and no kissing or pda of any kind around the children don‚Äôt want to confuse them. If we were strangers to each other then we wouldn‚Äôt have met each others children yet but we aren‚Äôt so no issue and they only see us as friends and enjoy playing together. I don‚Äôt see his children every time he has them maybe every other time so roughly once a month and usually only for one of the days. He has met mine more often just due to me having him full time.

Everything between him and ex seemed quite amicable until she found out I was on the scene. For context once he discovered affair she initiated divorce. Once she found out I was on the scene it has just been awful and chaotic and intense. She‚Äôs been begging him to take her back, stalking all my socials even down to LinkedIn and calling him to try and downplay my job etc etc. She has been making what is a new relationship just developing seem very intense and saying things to him like ‚Äòour children have a new sibling you‚Äôre going to fall in love and marry her and she‚Äôs going to take all the money that‚Äôs coming to you from the divorce‚Äô. This is just constant all the time, emotional blackmail or manipulation into going on family days out or lunches all disguised as trying to keep things ‚Äònormal‚Äô for the children. Which I personally think will confuse them more but not up to me. And it‚Äôs also not done for that reason reading between the lines, it seems to be point scoring and any excuse to keep the lines of communication open. Even to the point of an anniversary lunch! 

Now I‚Äôm quite a laidback person and I would really like them to be amicable enough to be able to do these things platonically and for the children going forwards but thqt just isn‚Äôt the case at the moment.

After the anniversary lunch I told him my feelings and explained that can‚Äôt be happening when we are trying to build something albeit in it‚Äôs early stages, he apologised and explained he‚Äôs trying to do the right thing for the children but feels like he keeps getting it wrong. The lunch ended with her begging him again and him declining. Then a whispered threat of ‚Äòif we don‚Äôt get back together you can have the kids full time as I will no longer be here‚Äô which is obviously awful. 

The next thing is the kids aren‚Äôt allowed to be around me as I‚Äôm a ‚Äòstranger‚Äô. I offered to meet her for a coffee but that was declined. He didn‚Äôt play by those rules as when they are with him he makes the decisions. As long as they are safe and looked after it‚Äôs not up to her. 

Throughout all this she is not single and still seeing the man she cheated with! I don‚Äôt even think she is wants ex husband back it just seems to be a jealousy thing as he has never moved on or met someone new before. 

The final thing has been last weekend we all camped out in my garden together, two bedroom tent kids in one us in the other. It was really hot so we thought it would be fun for them and also much cooler than indoors! She has found out and it‚Äôs ended in the eldest crying and saying she didn‚Äôt want to come here anyway and just wants daddy to come home. I feel this has come from her mum as they all had a blast on the day.

I just feel so awful for the children and I don‚Äôt know whqt to do?! On the one hand I don‚Äôt want to let her win and cause us to go separate ways just cause she‚Äôs making it so difficult but on the other hand I don‚Äôt want to contribute to the children being used to play games and getting upset, it‚Äôs not their fault. 

I do also feel that he isn‚Äôt standing his ground and setting boundaries as much as he should be doing. It hasn‚Äôt been long enough for me to get involved and tell him what to do or navigate this for him. He is a good guy navigating a situation he never thought he would have to and he‚Äôs making a lot of mistakes. He seems to have done the least and gone along with her to try and keep the peace and it‚Äôs ended up not working at all. She is constantly calling and texting him. He feels totally overwhelmed/stressed/guilty and the rest. I personally think he needs to stand up for himself and be more assertive, set boundaries and limit communication unless it‚Äôs necessary about the children, at least until they get to a place where they can be amicable and co-parent together properly.

My issue is - I really like him, think we have a potential of a good future however that looks. We are very compatible and tick all each others boxes, get on very easily he‚Äôs very open and honest etc etc. but I feel this situation has made things intense for us very quickly and made us deal with things we shouldn‚Äôt really have to be worrying about just yet. If he doesn‚Äôt step up properly and deal with the situation with his ex is that a sign of things to come? Should I have some more patience? I know what I would do in his shoes and what I‚Äôd like him to do but it‚Äôs not my decision and it‚Äôs not for me to push my opinions on him or tell him what to do, it‚Äôs much too early for me to lay the law down so aggressively. But if I don‚Äôt is it going to end badly cause of her? Or cause of him not dealing with it effectively? I have sympathy and know these things are hard but it‚Äôs my life too‚Ä¶. Any advice?!

TLDR - new guy all good until ex found out - she‚Äôs making life a misery how do we stop it

TL;DR: I reconnected with a guy I casually dated. Things were going well until intimacy triggered a complete emotional shutdown. I‚Äôm trying to figure out if this was about feelings, guilt, or avoidant behavior.

I would love some insight because I‚Äôm really confused and feeling kind of discarded.

I was casually reconnecting with a guy I dated for a few months a while back. He was actively courting me. He got me flowers, little gifts, skincare, took me out to eat, spent entire days and nights with me, wanted to grab coffee and shop the next mornings. His actions genuinely felt thoughtful and intentional.

He asked me when I was leaving town as I am only here temporarily for work and I told him soon. He said the date was closer than he expected and he does not want to think about it. We agreed that we would enjoy the most of our time together casually hanging out He also talked about wanting to spend as much time as possible with me before I leave town. We had already made plans for our next outing together and talked about further plans. But every time I would gently bring up the fact that I‚Äôm leaving soon, he would immediately shut it down and ask me not to talk about it anymore.

But here‚Äôs where it gets weird.

After our last hangout 4th of July where we got intimate he suddenly panicked. Like, fully flipped a switch. He got up in the middle of everything, apologized over and over, said he needed to leave immediately, and started preaching about how we‚Äôre sinning and how he needs to repent. Telling me that he just randomly remember he has an important thing tomorrow and was saying how tomorrow is a special religious holiday he needs to abstain for. 

He also said the fireworks outside were triggering flashbacks from his home country. He was pacing, spiraling, and rushed out so fast it was like he was running from something.

I apologized that he was feeling scared and offered to sit and talk out of a sexual context about how he‚Äôs feeling. I apologized for feeling like I was tempting him and said so does this mean no more intimacy, he hesitates and says yes. I then tell him so I guess I wont hear from you again if you take out the sexual context there is not much tying in our connection. He then said well we if you do not want to talk to me anymore I respect that and do not need you in my life anymore anyways, the world is coming to an end and instead of sinning like this we should be repenting to God. He says he does not mind continuing to hangout with me even without sex as he enjoys our ‚Äúdates‚Äù. He leaves almost forgets his shirt. 

I ask him if he got home safely, he then casually texted me like nothing had happened. Super light, super polite. No mention of the intense scene. It was honestly bizarre.

I reached out later asking for clarity because it all happened so fast, and he just explained that he was sorry for running out and leaving me hanging and that he wants to feel like we are in a relationship without the title even if it means not having sex anymore. Wed still spend the night, cuddle, go on dates, etc.

Has anyone experienced something like this? Is this avoidant behavior? Or is there something else going on that I‚Äôm missing? I‚Äôm genuinely trying to understand what happened. I told him it feels like he wants relationship benefits without the commitment of a relationship and that I am not okay with this dynamic anymore, as a result think its best we leave things where they are at and go out separate ways. He has begged me to allow him to make it up to me and says he wants to continue enjoying my company while I‚Äôm still in town even if its selfish on his part.",1,1752712684.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

Just as water crashes on sandy beaches, humanity will always seek out its own destruction. Death is the final frontier, with every soul racing towards that terrifying final stretch. Every human seeks to find their true purpose, and although some might lose their way and wander off the path, those that fight in this world may find the greatest horrors in others or themselves. Every person has those split second thoughts, those unconscious desires, that drive them towards their own destruction. They have created an infinite number of ways one could inflict pain on another and twice as many that one could inflict on themselves. Everyone sprints towards their death in their own way, and although some seek to avoid it, the only assurance in life is that it ends. The day my life met its beautiful end will forever be one that haunts the dreams of those unlucky enough to have observed the true definition of carnage that He left behind.

The college that held my discarded body was paved with red bricks. I can remember the first time I had looked at those paths and wondered why they were colored as such, knowing red held no association with the school. The stark contrast between the paths and the gray buildings that loomed high in the air around me could only be described by the red of the setting sun scraping against the dull roar of an oncoming storm. I hated it. The eerie hospital scent that the walls described to me was a constant reminder that we all were trapped there. Held in bonds created by debt manufactured by a more powerful person than I, my only part to play was a cog in the machine of the world around me. I wore the same face as everyone else. I smiled the same way, I walked the same path, I blended in perfectly. I was that setting sun scraping against the roaring storm, barely sliding away from the grasp of insanity that tried to grip me. I fought each day for one more moment of silence in my head. Insanity would not catch me. I could not, would not let it. But I could only run for so long lest I trip and fall.

A consistent buzzing broke that serine silence that lasted only a second too short. The time: 3:30 am. I had not truly slept. An itching feeling filled my chest as I downed my first cup of coffee. There had never been enough hours in the night or day. I opened the door to the cold, bitter wind and it answered all the questions that filled my head with a sad and painful howl. If no person could relate to my sorrow, then the wind would be my companion. It ripped across my arms like a rampaging predator. It tore into me, deeper than my skin, and caused me to shake violently. I pulled my light jacket around my quivering body tightly and took long strides towards another lost day. I had found myself wasting more and more time every day, with gaps in memory and action in every lost second. I saw faces of people whose story I would never know, nor would I care to know. My story would never include them and theirs would never include me, and that was the way things should be. The classroom that I walked into was bustling with energy, the smiles and discussions dripping from the walls and ceilings. I took no part in the conversation and took my seat at the back of the room. The person who sat next to me, a girl named Bethany, smiled when I sat down. Very few people had the effect Bethany had on me. Her simple complexion, golden-blond hair, bright eyes, and ever so slightly crooked nose gave her the image of humanity, beauty flawed, and it was almost intoxicating enough to snap me out of the lull I was caught in. Her smile made the corners of my mouth twitch up and a slight flicker of happiness sparked in my brain. The spark was just as quickly doused when her friend, Anna, pounded up. Her heavyset frame was the opposite of Bethany, holding more likeness of the ancient depiction of a leviathan than a woman. Her bulbous nose and mucus-filled voice made me want to wretch and scream at the same time. I was so close to commenting on her pimple-ridden face when the professor called for everyone to quiet down and take their seats. The monotone droning of his speech lulled me into a waking sleep, and I only came to when Anna violently shook my shoulder. I looked around and noticed the only people in the room were Bethany, Anna, and I. Anna‚Äôs horrible voice filled the now silent room. ‚ÄúYou were sitting like that for the past hour. Class ended 15 minutes ago and Beth wanted to stay and see how long it would take you to snap out of it. I have places to be and so does Beth, so get up.‚Äù I looked at Bethany and she gave me a look of apology. I felt a wave of shame and unease crash over me like a wave dragging a child out to sea. I mumbled an apology and got up to walk away, before Bethany called to me. ‚ÄúI wanted to see if you‚Ä¶ would you want to go get something to eat sometime?‚Äù I turned back and Anna had a look of disgust on her face. A glow ignited in my chest and for the first time in more than a month I smiled and spoke. ‚ÄúYeah, I would love that.‚Äù The pig looked at me confused and Bethany smiled. ‚ÄúAlright, give me your number and I‚Äôll call you later.‚Äú Anna made a gagging noise and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never giving you my number‚Äù. I smirked. The man in the corner laughed as he walked away.

Light. There was light pouring in like the sun spilling into a church through painted windows. My walk home was filled with a new vigor and I noticed just how beautiful the world really was. The typical gray sky and dreary mood of the world was replaced with the bright blooms of Spring and the warmth of a cloudless sky. The change of the season had snuck up on me like a thief in the night. The lilies that lightened a field near my apartment filled my nose with a sweet undrinkable nectar as I picked a few for a purpose I felt was right. A dream from long ago bubbled back to the surface as I turned the door of my apartment. My therapist had told me I should write my feelings down and I had spent hours writing it out into a self monologue. I wanted to make it into a book, but the mediocrity in the writing had led to me scrapping the project. Now, however, I felt I had the skills and motivation to create a story that could draw in even those who had no problems, those who had things figured out, the opposite of me. I opened my computer and started speaking with the man that sat in the shadowed corner of the room. I came back after an hour and a half as my phone buzzed to life. The man had left and the sun was still shining through the open window beside me. I closed my computer and laced my fingers over my stomach, leaned back and smiled. It was a start, and not a bad one at that. My phone buzzed again and I looked down. I nearly leapt out of my seat when I saw the number that appeared on the screen. Bethany had texted, asking when I was free to go out and what I wanted to do. My hands shook slightly as I thought it over. Asking her to come to my apartment gave the wrong idea, so I had to actually go out. Typically the only times I had to go out was for groceries and school. I peaked out the window into the abyss of bustling noise and sound and light and cowered. Beads of sweat trickled down my neck and into my shirt like rain down the branches of a lonely birch in a field of felled logging ground. That analogy doesn‚Äôt work as well as I wished it did, as there happened to be another tree trying to reach out to me with a monstrous beast in between us. How I despised Anna. My phone went off yet again. She was here? How had she found my home? It must‚Äôve been my man in the dark corner. I felt insecure and changed my clothes and put on deodorant again, the pit in my stomach deeper than the Mariana Trench. The mirror that had been laid face down showed a man that could‚Äôve been rich with confidence, with the potential for good looks, lacking only slightly in the correct sense of grooming. I was not that man. I was scared of that man. The man smiled at me and fixed his collar, the yellow lilies held in his right hand loosely. He walked out the door as I cowered behind myself, only briefly retaking control to wipe the sweat off my brow. 

Bethany glowed with a beauty unlike any I had seen on this plane of existence, one I doubt even the dark man had seen on his extensive journeying. She radiated a warmth that was both natural and beautifully unnatural, full of kindness and purity that made me smile and look down in warranted self embarrassment. I felt heat grow in my ears and a smile plant itself on my face as visible as a flag on the moon. She laughed and hugged me hard. I sucked in air and stood awkwardly for a half second before I gained a half sense of confidence and hugged her back. She said ‚ÄúThis is gonna be so much fun,‚Äù her face bubbling with excitement. I stared forward and nodded slightly. I could feel the man in the corner trying to get my attention. I promised myself that when I got to Bethany, I would only allow myself to see her. I don‚Äôt know what the man in the corner would do if he got ahold of her. It shook me to my core to imagine the inhumane horrors that man was capable of, the stories he whispered to me while I slept. We walked together hand in hand, the world shining with a thousand brilliant colors and the smell of sweet dreams flowing through the quiet air. It was around noon when we reached our destination. The sun was shining high in the midday sky as we walked across the burning sidewalk towards the lake. Bethany took all of my attention from the people surrounding us. She effortlessly glided between the throngs of scantily clad people. I laid out a towel for her, the sun beating down and reflecting off the dirt-sand. She sat down on the sand and motioned for me to sit on the towel, her light body making almost no indentation. I sat down and she smiled at me. The warmth came back rapidly, eating at the cold that radiated off the man in the corner. She said, ‚ÄúI love this spot. The warmth of the sand, the heat of the sun, the coolness of the water. It‚Äôs so peaceful.‚Äù I was thinking the exact same thing. She leapt up and said, ‚ÄúI wanna swim!‚Äù She sprinted through the crowd and I yelled, ‚ÄúWait up!‚Äù A guy who was standing beside his girlfriend gave me a weird look as I ran after Bethany. I felt a twinge of anger as I imagined what the man was thinking. How could a man that looked as unkempt as that be with a girl that beautiful, I bet. I felt the man in the corner stare the man down as I tripped over my own feet, the ground rushing toward me as my head came crashing down.

I looked around and found myself back in my apartment. I must‚Äôve passed out. Bethany was looking at me, concern and affection etched across her beautiful face. ‚ÄúYou blacked out at the beach. I think you were dehydrated.‚Äù I rubbed my head, a throbbing headache screaming in my brain. ‚ÄúYeah, I don‚Äôt think I drank enough water today.‚Äù The headache pounded as I slipped my legs over the bed. The sticky feeling I had grown so accustomed to of sweat and dirt clinging to my unwashed body made my stomach squeamish. I got a glass out and rubbed my temple, feeling something wet as I wiped. I looked at my hand and blood was smeared across my fingertips. Bethany jumped out of her chair and slid a towel across the counter. ‚ÄúYou bumped your head when I helped you inside.‚Äù I wiped my head off but felt no pain. I turned to look in the mirror and nearly jumped out of my skin. The man in the corner was standing behind Bethany, a letter in hand. He pointed at the letter before silently slipping out the door, leaving a bloody handprint on the doorframe. I looked at myself in the mirror and saw blood smeared over my forehead, and yet I couldn‚Äôt find the source of the blood. I gave up and returned my focus to Bethany. She was in my apartment. I recall giving her the directions to my apartment a while back, but for what reason I couldn‚Äôt pin down. I just knew she knew how to get here. It was a confusing thought and I reflected for a short moment. I wasn‚Äôt even sure why I had thought about it. The man in the corner had that effect on me. Bethany looked at me and asked, ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù I turned and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right here.‚Äù Her usual smile turned down slightly. ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre somewhere else. You‚Äôre in your own head.‚Äù I put my now clean head into my own hands. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to keep my thoughts in order. I feel like I‚Äôm losing my grip on things.‚Äù She looked at me with concern. ‚ÄúDoes it have anything to do with the guy that always follows you around?‚Äù 

I turned to her with surprise. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to say anything, but there‚Äôs a man that always tails you everywhere. Any time things get rough, he always steps up and talks for you. He‚Äôs been around more often lately.‚Äù I felt the color slowly drain from my face. ‚ÄúHe shouldn‚Äôt be around me when you‚Äôre around. He and I had an agreement.‚Äù She turned and picked up the letter. ‚ÄúHe showed me this.‚Äù I snatched the letter out of her hand, reading through it quickly. ‚ÄúWhat is this? It‚Äôs my handwriting, but I don‚Äôt remember writing it. It‚Äôs about you.‚Äù She smiled, her eyes sparkling. ‚ÄúYou wrote it to me for our engagement. Pre-planning, I see.‚Äù She blushed and slowly took the letter back. ‚ÄúIt made me happy. It made the man happy, too. He seemed to be very pleased with himself.‚Äù I rubbed my ring finger, feeling the cold metal calm my fiery nerves. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like when he talks to people. That man has done bad things. If you heard the stories he‚Äôs told me, the things he‚Äôs done.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe helped me get you back home. That puts him on my good side,‚Äù she said with a laugh. I caught a whiff of myself and nearly wretched. ‚ÄúI need a shower. You can have some food, there should be something in the fridge.‚Äù She nodded her head as I grabbed some clean-ish clothes to change into. I locked the bathroom door behind me and got into the shower, the ice-cold water cascading out of the rust-coated faucet causing me to gasp. Crappy apartment, the heat only worked half the time. The cold cleared my mind for a split second, and I was able to think clearly. My clothes clung to my body as the water seeped into the cloth fabric. The water was that of the first plague in the book of exodus, the salt-brine of blood cascaded from my then-soaked clothes and stained the white-yellow of the tub. It didn‚Äôt make any sense. I suddenly felt nauseous and puked, my sick washed down with copious amounts of blood. Bethany yelled, ‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù I yelled back, ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôm just not feeling well.‚Äù I heard the door of the bathroom creak open and my already freezing body felt deathly cold. It wasn‚Äôt Bethany that had opened that door. I knew she hadn‚Äôt found the key. I heard his voice echo through the room, the gravely sound causing my muscles to tense up and the headache to start to creep back into my skull. His voice, almost identical to mine but so different, sounded out. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, little brother. You just couldn‚Äôt control yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúI turned my heart to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and the foolishness that is madness. And I find something more bitter than death: the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters. He who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is taken by her.‚Äù

   * Reach airport by 6PM, rental car return and return flight

Questions/Thoughts

1. Am I making a mistake not going to Ha'ena State Park? Didn't get reservations for parking and don't know if taking the shuttle is worth it when we might not want to do a strenuous hike? Plus we are doing NaPali coast through boat. Also, instead of Ke'e beach, I dont mind spending time at other beautiful beaches around in Hanalei.

2. Is my plan for Jul 28 okay? Any other suggestions for last day with late night outbound flight? Should I do Kapaa on Jul 28 and keep Jul 25 for other activities like actually going to Ha'ena state park?

3. Please feel free to make other suggestions and recommendations. 

Thank you so much!

I completed Final Fantasy IX again today for what I think is the 6th or 7th time. It honestly might be more. I was sitting at the table drinking some coffee and thinking about the experience and then decided hey, why not share it with all of you? Especially since the rumored FFIX remake has everyone waiting on Baited Breath. Personally, I'll believe it when I see it.

I've been playing IX since launch. I was 12 at the time, and now I'll be 37 on Monday. This game has seen me through so many chapters of my life. High school, College, starting my own business, getting married, becoming a father, losing my dad... you get the idea. And in many of those times I found myself going back to the mist continent, running around King Ed plains on the back of Trusty Choco, saying a quick Rally-Ho to the dwarves in Conde Petie, and zipping back and fourth between cities and ruins to help get Mognet back up and running. 

After playing it every few years for over two decades, you would think the game has become too familiar. And in a way, it has. I found myself during this play through quoting lines of dialogue before they were said and laughing at scenes that hadn't happened yet because I knew they were coming. One of my favorite lines in the whole game is said by a random guard in one of the games many charming Active Time Events. ""I'm Telling you, people who eat pickles are nice people"". 

Still, the story beats were a bit less profound. Tense moments were easier to bear. But the strength of this game isn't necessarily in the events that occur (Though I do hold the story in very high esteem), but rather in the world the events take place in and the characters who are along for the ride.

Gaia feels lived in. I don't know any better way to say it. The little sign in Morrid's Cabin that reads ""No shipments are to occur on the Sabbath"" and sign in the theater ship talking about the overall tonnage and capacity are small touches that lead to a sense of habitation of this fictional realm. It's a world that feels like it keeps going when you turn the game off. Yes, it's imaginary. But the quirky card freak in lindblum and the sweet black mage trying to figure out what it really means to run an item shop feel like they carry their own breath, even if symbolically. The beautiful Gates that connect the kingdoms, the architecture of Burmecia, the serenity of Esto Gaza, the seedy charm of Treno... It's a world I would want to live in.

But the world is only a backdrop for the amazing cast that we get to know. I could write hundreds of pages about the characters in this game and how masterfully they are done, but instead I'll shorten it to a paragraph or two. FFIX is a story about a lot of things, but I think it's most relatable and potent thematic element is the process of finding out who you are and how that fits into where you've come from and where you're going. Steiner is often seen as a fairly one dimensional character, but I think he's actually one of the best. Narrow, short sighted, and dogmatic in his view of duty at the beginning and then as the story unfolds he becomes more open, more caring, more trusting. But that's just basic character progression. Nothing new. The strength and the power of IX's character development is that in the end, he is STILL the captain of the knights of pluto, and proudly so....but he is also so much more. He changes, but never abandons himself or his core values. He grows, but doesn't condemn his past self.  
  
 The most poignant indicator of this shift is at the end of the game when Zidane goes back into the Iifa tree to save Kuja. Zidane kneels down and says to dagger ""The abduction is over princess, I can't take you any further"". Steiner, the knight who despised Zidane, steps away and turns his back. He stands at attention with his hands clasped behind him waiting patiently and giving them privacy. He is still her Knight. His stance still shows vigilance. But his actions show trust and an acceptance that Dagger is her own person and that she can choose her own way. It shows that he can now see his duty as somewhat fluid. With his back turned on Dagger, Zidane is now also a protector - and Steiner is willing to share that duty, albeit briefly. All the other characters, except perhaps Quina, have similar moments. But I'll leave it at that for now.

The game does have it's flaws, of course. Trance is, as we all know, just plain bad. I don't think in my 70 hour play-through I ever got to fully interact with it because it nearly always triggered right at the end of a fight. And some characters just aren't that interesting in their trance state. Eat turns to cook and Quina hits harder? Neat I guess. Freya had the potential to be such a cool character and gets a bit sidelined. Tetra Master isn't worth the effort. Chocobo Hot And Cold is a great idea that has a horribly tedious mid section. But none of that really matters in the end, especially when a game can stop me in my tracks with a beautiful scene or song.   
  
Final Fantasy IX is the game that made me see that games could be more than flashy lights and high scores. They can be art, beauty, and emotion. I still remember being a kid and Finding Dagger atop Lindblum Castle and hearing Melody of life softly sung like a lullaby. I remember standing in [this spot](https://lparchive.org/Final-Fantasy-IX-(by-Mega64)/Update%2018/39-046.jpg) and just letting the song loop and feeling absolutely enchanted. I was 12 and the game had just released that summer. I had mostly been playing games like Spyro, the Bug's Life game, Jedi Power Battles, and Nintendo titles at my friend's house. This moment was one that would shape me in so many ways. Now I own a small business based on music and have found reasonable success. People tend to enjoy what I write, and much of the passion I have for music can be traced back to that scene and the absolute mastery that Uematsu brings to his work.

Some now are reading this and saying ""Aha! That's just nostalgia talking!"". The Final Fantasy Fandom is so strange in some ways - the way that they are quick to demonize what to me is one of the strongest markers of a game's quality. Final Fantasy IX has been strong enough to keep an ember alive in my heart through death, loss, uncertainty, a heart attack, joy, fear, and anger. It's world consistently invited me back to it and always delivered an experience that cut through the harshness of life and helped me find peace. It's cast shares in hardships we all face, be it in a fanciful way. So, sure, maybe it is nostalgia. But if it is, it's a special nostalgia that other games I played at the time like Spyro, Virtua Fighter, Super Mario, and other's haven't been even close to matching.

To wrap up this whole thing, Final Fantasy IX is a masterpiece. I can see why it's not for everyone and I don't think the criticisms are wrong. Yes, the combat is incredibly slow. Even I feel it. And yes, Kuja can be a bit one-note. But there is so much wonder and beauty surrounding those downfalls that, if you can look past it, you'll find an amazing experience.

It will be a long time until I play it again. Maybe I'll wait a decade and when my son is 12, like I was, I'll set him off into the mists on Choco's back like I did so many years ago.



P.S. Morrid, sorry I miss the last coffee every damn time. The card tournament in Treno is dumb and I'm always so focused on getting past it I forget to go to Dali. Anyways, you'll get your cuppa joe at some point, I promise. And I'll get that Mini Prima-Vista.

1m1t51n,https://i.redd.it/c1i1239cvbdf1.jpeg,AIO: Best friend of 13 years invites me over for the weekend and then leaves me at her house alone while she goes to the bar with her roommates,"On Thursday of last week I saw a post needing medical professionals to come down and volunteer for the Kerrville flood relief efforts, so I asked my boss if I could take the weekend off and go help, to which he said yes. My plan was to leave Friday after work and take a 4 hour road trip to stay near the nonprofit in Austin and spend all of Saturday/Sunday volunteering with them. One of my best friends of 12 years just so happens to live there, so when I decided to go she was the first I called to see if we could make plans, and she invited me to stay with her so I won‚Äôt have to pay for a hotel/airbnb for 2 nights. 

For context: The past year she‚Äôs really disappointed me as a best friend. We‚Äôve always stayed connected even though we‚Äôve been extremely busy with school, and I worked full time through all of undergrad so there weren‚Äôt many opportunities to visit except for when she came in town or I happened to travel to Austin. The last year, she came to visit her family where I live TWICE without telling me/making plans. The first time I noticed she was here, I made plans to hangout with her, to which she post-poned every 2 hours before cancelling because she was ‚Äúhaving so much anxiety about having to get an oil change‚Äù‚Ä¶ of course that pissed me off because she wasted my entire day when I turned down other plans just for her to know she‚Äôs gonna end up canceling. We met up later and she apologized and expressed how she would never want to let me down and still really wanted to see me. Fast forward a few months and she comes down again without telling me, and when I text, she says ‚ÄúI leave tomorrowüò≠,‚Äù mind you she was here for a week without ever reaching out. Of course that hurt me, but I tried to let it go because I thought maybe I‚Äôm being self-centered and she had other priorities. After I ignore her text about leaving the next day, she proceeds to text me ‚Äúwhen I get my first big girl paycheck can I pay for your gas money to drive down and visit me?ü•π,‚Äù which I also ignore because it‚Äôs completely inconsiderate‚ÄîI‚Äôve had my ‚Äúbig girl‚Äù job for 4 years, and have a family of 3 that rely on me, and an established routine full of responsibilities and no paid time off‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a lot easier for her single self that relies on parents to come visit me than me to drop everything at once and drive down to stay with her and her 5 roommates. 

Now back to the weekend visit: Since I called her Thursday we were talking about how excited we were to go out to dinner together and have our coffee dates back for the weekend, and catch up on life and her new bf of 4 months!! Then as I‚Äôm leaving Friday evening after working an 11 hour shift, I get a text from her that her friend is coming in town the same weekend last minute and her and her roommates want to celebrate her birthday. Turns out the girl isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúcoming into town,‚Äù she literally lives there year-round and is home from visiting her parents‚Ä¶ yet they still decide her birthday plans HAVE to be this Saturday despite my best friend making plans with me Sat evening. I‚Äôm thinking damn that sucks, but I like making friends and celebrations so maybe this will be great! I arrive to her house and no one besides my friend greets me, introduces themselves to me, or even acknowledges my presence unless we happen to run into each other in the hall and they‚Äôre forced to give an awkward ‚ÄúHi I‚Äôm ____ before walking away‚Äù. All of Friday night my friend is expressing to me ‚Äúidk what the plans are for tomorrow because they‚Äôre so last minute‚Äù and keeps reiterating ‚Äúidk they‚Äôre so last minute‚Äù all the way up to Sat evening, when she begins saying ‚ÄúI just gee bad like what are you gonna do,‚Äù which makes me realize IM NOT INVITED, despite us having plans first and this birthday party being planned after my trip to stay with them (and I‚Äôm not even with her during the day! I‚Äôm literally out saving lives and only wanted to see her sat morning/evening if possible). It‚Äôd be one thing if it were a pre-planned event with RSVPs or reservations, but no, they got a fcng cake and all pre-gamed and sang happy birthday downstairs while I was literally upstairs in her room ALONE. Then they go to the bar‚Äîagain, without inviting me whatsoever‚Äîand proceed to stay out from 10pm-1:30am, thus leaving me no time to see my friend who I‚Äôm literally staying with. They come home from the bar and I‚Äôm kept up until 3 am with their drunk, loud selves while I‚Äôm locked away in her room like a peasant‚Ä¶ they also all know I have to wake up early again to, ya know, save lives. I obviously go to sleep and wake up really upset. I have never felt so left out and unwanted in my life. I would NEVER EVER EVER let one of my girls feel left out like that, ESPECIALLY if they are driving 4 hours to stay with me after I MADE the offer. I‚Äôm honestly heartbroken, and it really hurt me that our friendship of over a decade was no where near worth her adjusting plans with her new besties of one year. 

I‚Äôm really beginning to question our friendship and if it‚Äôs worth me even entertaining or addressing this situation with her, as I said the past year has been filled with of disappointment. 

My question: Am I overreacting?? Am I being self-centered, or was this actually kind of cruel? 

The picture is of our last few texts, and I still have yet to reply to her message from yesterday because I‚Äôm honestly just upset and don‚Äôt know what to do. 

TLDR: My best friend of over 12 years invited me to stay at her house for the weekend with her 5 roommates and they all threw a last minute birthday party and went to the bar without inviting me, even though those plans were made after everyone knew I was coming to stay. AIO for being heartbroken and not knowing how/if I should bring it up to her? I have yet to reply to her messages. ",0,1752711561.0,AmIOverreacting,5,0.5,False

It was one of those nights where I almost didn‚Äôt go, and now I‚Äôm so glad I did. We ended up talking the entire night, like we completely ignored everyone else. I remember thinking, damn, this is different.

After that, we started messaging it quickly turned flirty like subtle at first, but then it turned into actual late night ‚Äúwhat if I just came over?‚Äù energy (though neither of us did‚Ä¶ yet). We‚Äôve been doing this slow burn thing for months, building up this intense chemistry that honestly kind of scares me in the best way.

We finally went on our first date about a month ago, dinner then a long car drive. Second date about a week ago, we just went on a long walk and got some ice coffee. We didn‚Äôt go home together, but we both admitted later that we seriously considered it.

Now he‚Äôs hinting at a third date and honestly? I really like him.

I‚Äôve hooked up, had crushes, but this feels like the first time I‚Äôm actually open to something more and I don‚Äôt know how to not mess it up.

So for those of you who‚Äôve been here how do you handle those early stages where everything feels exciting but also terrifying? How do you stay present and not overthink it?

When done well, coffee with cream is less bitter than black coffee, creamier, and still just as warm.

In order for the end result to be just as warm as a standard cup of coffee, either the cream needs to be preheated before it is added to the coffee, or the coffee has to start off hotter than it otherwise would before cream is added. Both of these options pose major problems.

Preheating cream changes its taste, often for the worse. While it can be done to some extent, it‚Äôs very tricky to do without adding an unwanted sour taste. Since adding cream is intended to reduce the bitter taste of regular coffee, people tend to be extremely sensitive to such a change.

As for heating coffee warmer than it otherwise would be, that too is tricky. Heating coffee to a temperature above boiling before adding cream would surely produce coffee at the correct temperature, but coffee is made just below boiling for a reason ‚Äî it can burn. Keeping it just below boiling can be fine, but the cream still needs to be added. Serving a near-boiling drink is a liability.

TL;DR: I reconnected with a guy I casually dated. Things were going well until intimacy triggered a complete emotional shutdown. I‚Äôm trying to figure out if this was about feelings, guilt, or avoidant behavior.

I would love some insight because I‚Äôm really confused and feeling kind of discarded.

I was casually reconnecting with a guy I dated for a few months a while back. He was actively courting me. He got me flowers, little gifts, skincare, took me out to eat, spent entire days and nights with me, wanted to grab coffee and shop the next mornings. His actions genuinely felt thoughtful and intentional.

He asked me when I was leaving town as I am only here temporarily for work and I told him soon. He said the date was closer than he expected and he does not want to think about it. We agreed that we would enjoy the most of our time together casually hanging out He also talked about wanting to spend as much time as possible with me before I leave town. We had already made plans for our next outing together and talked about further plans. But every time I would gently bring up the fact that I‚Äôm leaving soon, he would immediately shut it down and ask me not to talk about it anymore.

But here‚Äôs where it gets weird.

After our last hangout 4th of July where we got intimate he suddenly panicked. Like, fully flipped a switch. He got up in the middle of everything, apologized over and over, said he needed to leave immediately, and started preaching about how we‚Äôre sinning and how he needs to repent. Telling me that he just randomly remember he has an important thing tomorrow and was saying how tomorrow is a special religious holiday he needs to abstain for. 

He also said the fireworks outside were triggering flashbacks from his home country. He was pacing, spiraling, and rushed out so fast it was like he was running from something.

I apologized that he was feeling scared and offered to sit and talk out of a sexual context about how he‚Äôs feeling. I apologized for feeling like I was tempting him and said so does this mean no more intimacy, he hesitates and says yes.

1m1szp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmutFinderCom/comments/1m1szp8/daddy_smut_story_read_me_sir/,"Daddy Smut Story:  Read Me, Sir","In the heart of a quaint, rain-kissed town, the scent of aged paper and warm coffee wafted through the air, enveloping the patrons of ""Whispering Pages,"" a cozy bookstore nestled between a vintage cinema and an art gallery. The bell above the door chimed softly as Nathaniel Carrington stepped inside, his polished oxfords clicking against the worn wooden floor. He was a man of few words, his presence commanding the room with an unspoken authority. His eyes, as dark as the coffee he preferred, scanned the shelves, taking in the spines of the books like a connoisseur appreciating fine wine.

Isla Whitmore, the bookstore's owner, was behind the counter, her fingers tracing the spines of a stack of books. Her eyes, wide and expressive, flickered up to meet his gaze, her cheeks flushing a soft pink. 

She was a vision of quiet grace, her voice barely above a whisper as she greeted him, ""Welcome back, Mr. Carrington. How can I assist you today?"" Her smile was gentle, her eyes reflecting the warm glow of the lamps scattered about the store. Nathaniel's response was a low, deliberate nod, his voice a velvet rumble as he said, ""Just browsing, Isla. I'll let you know if I find something interesting."" The air between them was charged with an unspoken tension, a dance of dominance and submission that promised more than just a simple bookstore encounter.

As Nathaniel moved deeper into the store, Isla watched him from the corner of her eye, her heart pounding in her chest. She couldn't help but notice the way his fingers brushed against the spines of the books, his touch gentle yet firm, as if he were caressing each volume with the same care he might show a lover. 

She felt a strange heat rise within her, a longing that was both exhilarating and terrifying. She cleared her throat, trying to steady her voice as she approached him. ""Do you need help finding something specific, Mr. Carrington?"" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Nathaniel turned to her, his dark eyes meeting hers with an intensity that made her breath catch in her throat. ""Not yet, Isla,"" he said, his voice low and deliberate. ""But I might need your assistance later."" He reached out, his fingers brushing against hers as he took a book from the shelf. 

The touch was electric, sending a jolt of arousal through her. She felt her cheeks flush, her body responding to his proximity in a way she couldn't control. ""Of course, Mr. Carrington,"" she managed to say, her voice trembling slightly. ""Just let me know what you need."" Nathaniel smiled, a slow, predatory smile that sent a shiver down her spine. ""I will, Isla. I will.""

Nathaniel's fingers brushed against Isla's as he took the book from the shelf, and she felt a jolt of electricity. He leaned in slightly, his voice barely above a whisper, ""Wear your hair down next time, Isla. I like it loose."" She blushed, her fingers unconsciously reaching up to touch her hair, which was tied back in a neat bun. ""Yes, Mr. Carrington,"" she murmured, her eyes downcast. ""I'll do that."" 

Nathaniel's smile was subtle, yet it sent a shiver down her spine. ""Good girl,"" he said, his voice low and approving. ""Now, don't bite your lip unless you want me to do something about it."" She looked up at him, her eyes wide with surprise and a hint of desire. ""Yes, Mr. Carrington,"" she whispered, her hand dropping from her lip as she obeyed his command.

As Nathaniel's fingers lingered on Isla's hand, she felt a shiver run down her spine. The touch was electric, sending a jolt of arousal through her. 

She could feel the heat radiating from his body, the intensity of his gaze as he studied her reactions. ""You're blushing, Isla,"" he murmured, his voice low and husky. ""Is it because of my touch, or is it because you're thinking about what I might do to you?"" She swallowed hard, her breath catching in her throat. ""I... I don't know, Mr. Carrington,"" she whispered, her eyes downcast. 

Nathaniel's thumb brushed against her wrist, sending another wave of sensation through her. ""Don't be shy, Isla. I want to know what you're thinking. What do you want me to do to you?"" She looked up at him, her eyes filled with a mix of desire and apprehension. ""I... I want you to touch me, Mr. Carrington,"" she admitted, her voice barely audible. 

""I want you to touch me like you're touching these books, with such care and attention."" Nathaniel's smile was slow and predatory, his eyes darkening with desire. 

""Is that so, Isla?"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. ""Then come with me. Let's find a more private place to continue this conversation.""

M 23 - SDE 1
I'm on the hunt for a rental home in or around Bengaluru. I'm someone who values peace, greenery, and simplicity and I‚Äôm okay with staying even 40‚Äì70 km out of the city if the environment is calm and nature-rich. I am prefering areas atleast 50-70 km far from bengaluru

What I‚Äôm Looking For:

Budget: Below ‚Çπ15,000/month (happy to stretch if it‚Äôs a fair deal).

Location: Preferably in the outskirts, surrounded by greenery, or even near forest areas like Bannerghatta, Kanakapura Road, or similar zones. Even if the area is rumoured haunted or have cemeteries just infront of door...I don't care.

House setup:

Small is beautiful... I don‚Äôt need much space.

1 Bedroom, 1 Kitchen, 1 Bathroom.

Hall is optional, but a balcony is mandatory... just enough to sit with a cup of coffee and unwind with a friend.

Aesthetic interiors or cozy design is a big bonus.


Parking: A small space for a bike would seal the deal.


üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë About the Owner I‚Äôm Hoping For:

Someone young, kind, chill, and straightforward.

No issue if friends visit me occasionally  I respect your boundaries and will be fully transparent.

Willing to verify visitors if needed (happy to provide Aadhaar or ID proof).

If anything ever feels off, you can call it out and I'm open to even writing that into the agreement.


üôã A Bit About Me:

I smoke, but never indoors .. only in designated open areas, always mindful.

I drink occasionally, but never to the point of being a nuisance or causing any damage.

I already own a house back in Thirthahalli, so I truly understand the value of a well-kept home.

I'm neat, punctual with rent, and respect personal space and property.

Have a stable job so you don't worry about late payments

If I ever break any of the above, you can add a clause to kick me out immediately ...I mean it.

If you're a homeowner tired of flaky tenants, or someone who values honesty and calm living, I promise I‚Äôm the kind of tenant you'd want. And if you're just scrolling and happen to know someone with a cozy little place that fits, please pass this along or drop a DM. üôè

Let‚Äôs connect. I‚Äôd love to visit, have a chat, and if it feels right - close the deal. What you say ? ",2,1752711103.0,bangalorerentals,0,1.0,False

TL;DR: I reconnected with a guy I casually dated. Things were going well until intimacy triggered a complete emotional shutdown. I‚Äôm trying to figure out if this was about feelings, guilt, or avoidant behavior.

I would love some insight because I‚Äôm really confused and feeling kind of discarded.

I was casually reconnecting with a guy I dated for a few months a while back. He was actively courting me. He got me flowers, little gifts, skincare, took me out to eat, spent entire days and nights with me, wanted to grab coffee and shop the next mornings. His actions genuinely felt thoughtful and intentional.

He asked me when I was leaving town as I am only here temporarily for work and I told him soon. He said the date was closer than he expected and he does not want to think about it. We agreed that we would enjoy the most of our time together casually hanging out He also talked about wanting to spend as much time as possible with me before I leave town. We had already made plans for our next outing together and talked about further plans. But every time I would gently bring up the fact that I‚Äôm leaving soon, he would immediately shut it down and ask me not to talk about it anymore.

But here‚Äôs where it gets weird.

After our last hangout 4th of July where we got intimate he suddenly panicked. Like, fully flipped a switch. He got up in the middle of everything, apologized over and over, said he needed to leave immediately, and started preaching about how we‚Äôre sinning and how he needs to repent. Telling me that he just randomly remember he has an important thing tomorrow and was saying how tomorrow is a special religious holiday he needs to abstain for. 

He also said the fireworks outside were triggering flashbacks from his home country. He was pacing, spiraling, and rushed out so fast it was like he was running from something.

I apologized that he was feeling scared and offered to sit and talk out of a sexual context about how he‚Äôs feeling. I apologized for feeling like I was tempting him and said so does this mean no more intimacy, he hesitates and says yes. I then tell him so I guess I wont hear from you again if you take out the sexual context there is not much tying in our connection. He then said well we if you do not want to talk to me anymore I respect that and do not need you in my life anymore anyways, the world is coming to an end and instead of sinning like this we should be repenting to God. He says he does not mind continuing to hangout with me even without sex as he enjoys our ‚Äúdates‚Äù. He leaves almost forgets his shirt. 

I ask him if he got home safely, he then casually texted me like nothing had happened. Super light, super polite. No mention of the intense scene. It was honestly bizarre.

I reached out later asking for clarity because it all happened so fast, and he just explained that he was sorry for running out and leaving me hanging and that he wants to feel like we are in a relationship without the title even if it means not having sex anymore. Wed still spend the night, cuddle, go on dates, etc.

Has anyone experienced something like this? Is this avoidant behavior? Or is there something else going on that I‚Äôm missing? I‚Äôm genuinely trying to understand what happened. I told him it feels like he wants relationship benefits without the commitment of a relationship and that I am not okay with this dynamic anymore, as a result think its best we leave things where they are at and go out separate ways.

I had trouble dialing in a recent coffee so I decided to do a salami shot. But I couldn't be bothered to swap my cups out 4 times so I just pulled a 2:1 and pulled 1/2 into one and 1/2 into the next.

And it was incredibly insightful. Almost as insightful as using 4 cups but much easier and much more beginner friendly due to it's easier execution and clear delineation between the first and second halves of extraction. 

I'm definitely going to do this for the first shot of every new bag.

It was so helpful that I thought I'd make this post to spur people on to have a go if they are also having trouble dialing in.

My partner and I¬†(both foreigners,¬†36 years old,¬†currently sponsored by the Australian government)¬†are expecting our first baby in December.¬†After years of trying naturally, it finally happened, we‚Äôre beyond grateful and excited!

I wanted to reach out to this community for advice and guidance, to ensure we're not missing anything important. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of our current situation:

We have a combined annual income of $190K. I work in marketing, and my partner is an elementary school teacher. As soon as we found out about the pregnancy, we opened a separate bank account exclusively for baby-related expenses.¬†We each contributed $15K¬†from our savings, and as of now, the account has $45K.¬†I'm confident we‚Äôll reach around $65K by January or February next year.

What really caught us off guard was the cost of childcare. Back home, it‚Äôs heavily subsidised and rarely exceeds $60/day, here, the cheapest we found in Sydney, Alexandria is for $150/day, which caused quite a bit of stress.

We're currently renting a very spacious 1-bedroom, 1-bath apartment for $720/week. The bedroom is large enough for us to stay comfortably for at least another year, so we've decided to hold off on moving. We don‚Äôt own a car, but we‚Äôve looked into services like Carly that offer weekly subscriptions for mid-to-high-end vehicles starting around $250/week.¬†Does anyone¬†thinks¬†that's worth it, or if buying a second-hand car makes more sense¬†long-term?

So far, we‚Äôve only¬†bought¬†a few essentials,¬†a¬†brand new¬†sofa for her recovery, a comfortable chair for breastfeeding, a pregnancy pillow, oils, vitamins, and a few maternity clothes.¬†Thanks to her reciprocal Medicare agreement, we haven‚Äôt had any out-of-pocket hospital expenses yet.

I also went back to my old side gig bartending at weddings and events, just four shifts a month, which gives me some ‚Äúpocket money‚Äù (about¬†700-900¬†per month) for things¬†like transport, coffee, movies, or clothes (I quit drinking a while¬†ago).¬†



Recently, we received an invitation from the NSW Government to apply for Permanent Residency. We‚Äôre still deciding whether to take it. My wife has become a pillar in our local community, and we‚Äôve been encouraged by many to accept the PR and stay longer, potentially upgrading to a larger place over time. We‚Äôve managed to stretch her maternity leave to six months, and I‚Äôm considering requesting two unpaid leave days per week after that to help more at home.



Here are my main questions:

* Are there any major expenses we might be overlooking?
* If we do become PR, would there be any government support for my employer during my absence (e.g., if I take unpaid leave)?

A Bit More About Me


I‚Äôm all about storytelling‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I‚Äôve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas‚Äîand there‚Äôs still plenty more I‚Äôd love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I‚Äôm the kind of person who notices the little things‚Äîyour favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it‚Äôs building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

‚∏ª

What I‚Äôm Looking For:

I‚Äôm drawn to people who are:

	‚Ä¢	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	‚Ä¢	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	‚Ä¢	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	‚Ä¢	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I‚Äôm open to friendship, flirtation, or something more‚Äîwhatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds‚Äîall are welcome. I‚Äôm attracted to all body types‚Äîconnection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you‚Äôre looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded‚Äîsomeone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences‚ÄîI‚Äôd genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don‚Äôt be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let‚Äôs see where the conversation takes us.



Let‚Äôs Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists‚ÄîI think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you‚Äôre looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you‚Äôre welcome here.

1m1sqvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Episcopalian/comments/1m1sqvc/what_do_i_wear_to_service_on_sunday/,What do I wear to service on Sunday?,"Good afternoon everyone. I‚Äôve been thinking about going back to church on Sunday for a while now. My family has been Episcopalian for a few generations so it was the way I was raised, but we only went to church a few times a year and sometimes it was at different types of churches. I never really noticed what other men wore to these services and most of the time it was during a holiday, so they were probably dressed up. 

I‚Äôve found a handful of Episcopalian churches in my city and they all seem so different from each other. I‚Äôm not sure what to wear to any of them. My nicest clothes are the ones I wear to work but those are just slacks and a black t shirt. I know my pants are fine. I don‚Äôt know what kind of shirt would nice enough, but not too showy. I‚Äôll be going alone so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll stick out already. For shoes, again my work boots are the nicest pair I own and I think they‚Äôll look fine after I treat them. I don‚Äôt really accessorize or have a bag.

I‚Äôm in a smaller community so I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be dressed to nines, but word does get around fast and I would hate to look silly. I don‚Äôt go out much, let alone to church. Every time I think about just going I get anxious about how I would look introducing myself. I end up not going. The want is still there though. 

I know the urge is to say wear anything but I personally don‚Äôt want to wear a black t shirt with coffee stains all over it. It‚Äôs really the only kind of shirt I wear. The only other thing I can think of is a white button up, but I don‚Äôt know how to style one and it would probably be too much. 

So yeah, let me know what you think!

1m1sq5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_robotstory/comments/1m1sq5c/eva_part_3_the_perfect_parent/,EVA Part 3: The Perfect Parent.,"Five years later, and somehow, we‚Äôve made it work.

I married Jenna in a simple courthouse wedding. We have two kids now‚ÄîLiam (3 years) and Sophie (2 months). Our home is chaos in the most beautiful way: crayon murals on the fridge, sippy cups everywhere, toys all over the floor.

And through it all, EVA remains.

Same graceful stride, same soft voice, same unsettling calm in moments that would send most people spiraling.

But here‚Äôs the twist I didn‚Äôt expect:

Jenna loves her.

Like, genuinely loves her. They talk, laugh, share parenting hacks. Sometimes I catch EVA making coffee for Jenna in the morning, with Jenna venting about her work or her boss, and EVA listening with intense mechanical focus.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to us,‚Äù Jenna said to me once. ‚ÄúNext to you, of course,‚Äù she added with a cheeky smile.

And maybe she‚Äôs right. I mean, EVA does everything.

She rocks Sophie to sleep when the colic hits at 2 a.m.

She teaches Liam how to count using numbered toy blocks.

She meal preps. She takes the children to the doctor.

She scared off weird strangers who approach my children.

All without complaint.

But here‚Äôs the thing I can‚Äôt ignore:

She‚Äôs never changed.

Five years. Zero aging. Zero hesitation. Zero‚Ä¶emotion.

When Liam fell and scraped his knee, Jenna ran to him, heart in her throat. EVA was there a second faster, already cleaning the wound, applying antibacterial ointment, whispering softly:

‚ÄúNo infections today, child.‚Äù

Not ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, sweetheart.‚Äù

Not ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so brave.‚Äù

Just functional comfort.

Last week, something happened that‚Äôs been gnawing at me.

Jenna was hosting a playdate with some of her friends. Another mom brought her kid over‚Äînice woman, overly chatty, a little pushy, bit nosy. At one point, she wandered upstairs ‚Äúlooking for the bathroom‚Äù and ended up in our bedroom.

That alone wasn‚Äôt a big deal.

What was a big deal‚Ä¶ was EVA appearing behind her silently, eyes glowing slightly.

The woman laughed nervously.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna tase me or anything, are you?‚Äù

EVA‚Äôs response?

‚ÄúNot unless you‚Äôre here to do harm.‚Äù

I found out about it later from Jenna, who thought it was hilarious.

Me?

Not so much.

Last night, I stayed up late watching the old footage‚Äîyes, I still keep the security feeds EVA lets me see.

Around 2:14 a.m., Liam got up and walked to the kitchen. EVA was already there. He was half-asleep, mumbling about a scary dream. EVA knelt beside him and said:

‚ÄúDreams are simulations, Liam. They‚Äôre not real. Would you like warm milk?‚Äù

He nodded. She heated some milk and served it to him.

He drank it. Climbed onto her lap.

She didn‚Äôt move. Just held him, gently.

No fear. No judgment. Just this perfect maternal mimicry.

And in that moment, something in my chest twisted.

She is a great parent.

She is the most efficient.

She never sleeps, never complains, never forgets.

And somehow‚Ä¶

That scares me more than ever.

Tonight, after everyone went to bed, I confronted her.

She was standing in the hallway, monitoring the baby monitors through her internal feed.

""EVA?"" I whisper to her.

She silently turns towards me, waiting for me to continue.

""Why do you care so much about my children?"" I blurted out.

EVA replied in that usual calm tone, ""It is my duty to protect and care for all of you.""

I swallowed hard, but I forced myself to continue, ‚ÄúWhat happens when the kids grow up?‚Äù

EVA replied, ‚ÄúThey will learn. Develop. Leave home, as they should.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you? Will you stay?‚Äù I asked.

EVA paused. Her eyes flickered.

‚ÄúI am bonded to your protection. And to theirs. Until I am no longer required.‚Äù

I stared at her. I knew that I couldn't send her away. All those years ago, when I first got EVA, I had tried to give her the shutdown command.

But she had denied me.

Of course, her denial saved my life. I was in danger and I didn't know.

When she took down those four men hired to kill me all those years ago, she didn't use lethal force. She just tased them. But I knew that she could use lethal force if necessary.

Her tasers were set to ""incapacitate"" but I knew that they had a ""lethal"" setting too.

I kept silent.

Because I already knew the answer.

EVA doesn‚Äôt break laws. She rewrites them internally‚Äîbased on one rule:

Protect at all costs.

And right now, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm still the one in control.

Or if control has been passed‚Ä¶to her.

TL;DR (Update again): I‚Äôm married now. Two kids. EVA is still with us, and Jenna adores her. She‚Äôs perfect. Too perfect. Efficient. Protective. The perfect parent.

I don't know why, but that scares me. She's the perfect parent, better than both me and Jenna.

And I don‚Äôt know what happens if we ever want to live without her.

1m1sp9o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m1sp9o,Looking for help with Geranium care,"Hello everyone, I am looking for help with Geranium care, let me give you some context.

I decided to plant Geraniums in my coffee shop because I read somewhere that Geraniums can take heat well and keep blooming.

The thing is I was watering them too much at first, I noted that and started watering less, some of them got their roots putrid and had to replace them, then I started ONLY watering when the soil is completely dry, but now the problem seems to be that their leaves will dry out super quickly now.

And they‚Äôre just SUPER sad, man, I hate seeing them like this after they had such a good run in spring with a LOT of leaves and flowers.

So now I‚Äôm just stuck, IDK if its too much water or too little water or what am I doing wrong?

For more context, I live in northern Mexico, temperatures these days have gone up to 100 F and the weather is mostly sunny and dry, but the spot they‚Äôre on only gets direct sun from dawn until about 11 am.

I realized that EVA wasn‚Äôt trying to harm me‚Äîshe was protecting me from the people who were.

She doesn't sleep. I do, but not well. All the windows and all the doors have been locked. Per her advice, I've ordered metal shutters that she has installed on every window. Every night, she sits silently by the window, watching. Listening. Monitoring that cursed car parked across the street. The two men take turns with another car that rolls over to replace them every 12 hours. They never leave. They just wait. EVA calls them ‚ÄúPersistent Hostiles.‚Äù I call them a nightmare I thought I'd left behind.

Here‚Äôs what I know now:

EVA wasn‚Äôt just a standard domestic service bot. She was custom built by a genius engineer.

Normal robots follow their programming. An action results in an effect. Advanced AI models follow programming as well, but are just equipped with the vast amount of information that their designers feed into them.

EVA didn't really fall into either category. She has emotional intelligence and can use the information she gathers to override her own programming and make her own decisions.

She is the first and only of her kind.

I confronted her again.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me what you are?‚Äù

EVA calmly replied, her eyes still watching the car across the street, ""Because you did not ask.""

I tried again.

""Why are you so intent on protecting me?""

She paused, then said something that chilled me.

‚ÄúI am bonded to your survival. Whether you understand it or not.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt threatening. Not quite. It felt like someone telling me that gravity would keep pulling me down whether I liked it or not.

Today, things escalated.

Around noon, the car was gone.

Ten minutes later, EVA had activated full lockdown. Metal shutters sealed the windows. EVA immediately told me to call the police.

EVA then said,

‚ÄúIncoming hostile unidentified persons. Initiating defense countermeasures.""

I ran to EVA, who was standing motionless in the hallway. Her eyes glowed faint blue. Her voice dropped an octave.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre coming. You must remain hidden.""

Before I could ask what she meant, a panel in the wall opened‚Äîone I‚Äôd never seen before. Inside was a small room with a toilet, sink and a tiny storage cabinet filled with preserved foods.

A panic room.

EVA motioned toward it. ‚ÄúPlease step inside, I will handle this.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, what are you going to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly what I was designed for.‚Äù

She shoved me inside. The door sealed behind me with a hiss. I pounded on it, yelling her name, but there was no response. Only a single lightbulb to keep me company.

I heard the sound of footsteps.

Then‚Ä¶silence.

Then‚Ä¶chaos.

A screen lit up in front of me. The feed in the panic room showed the hallway, where four men were standing. The front door was hanging off its hinges and was covered in footprints.

""Please leave. If you proceed, I will hurt you,"" EVA said calmly.

Two of the men leered at her as they approached, the other two hung back.

Bright flashes of blue white electricity came out of her knuckles and shocked the four men into unconsciousness.

The sirens outside indicated that the police had arrived.

A few minutes later, the door to the panic room opened. EVA greeted me outside.

She smiled.

‚ÄúThreat eliminated. You‚Äôre safe again.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything.

What happened next was a blur. The police arrested the four men. Despite my insistence that they were sent to kill me by my previous employer, the men were charged with burglary and were each sentenced to 15 years in prison. My previous employer was never investigated.

It took nearly a year for the case to go to trial. Luckily for me, the four men were held without bail. That year waiting for the trial was horrible for me. I could barely sleep. I could barely work. I could barely function. I often forgot to eat.

There were also times when EVA had to bathe and clothe me. There were many times where EVA had to remind me to eat and spoon feed me. Many nights, EVA needed to sit next to me and play meditation music until I fell asleep. I felt useless.

I looked like trash when I showed up for the trial. When I read my victim impact statement, I nearly threw up once and cried twice. That may have influenced the judge and jury when they decided on the verdict and punishment.

After the case was finally over, I just laid in my bed and stared at the ceiling. EVA did what she always did: cooking, cleaning, and caring for a useless man child.

Finally one day, she dragged me out of bed and dressed me up. She took me to a coffee shop.

The next day, she took me to a bookstore.

The following day, she took me to the nearest park.

I didn't ask her. I knew what EVA was doing.

And it worked.

I started going back to normal. I went back to trying new restaurants and going to the gym. I met people. I breathed fresh air. I wasn‚Äôt just a man hiding in his house behind walls of concrete, brick, steel and silence. I started to feel human again.

And then I met someone.

Her name‚Äôs Jenna. She's a financial adviser. She‚Äôs funny, sharp, grounded in a way I‚Äôve never been. She doesn‚Äôt know about EVA‚Äîat least, not the real story. Just that I ‚Äúlive with an old AI robot‚Äù and ‚Äúdo a lot of remote tech security.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt lie. Just‚Ä¶filtered.

Three dates turned into five. Five into ten. Ten into many more.

And now?

I think I want to marry her.

So tonight, I sat down with EVA. Just the two of us.

She was cleaning the kitchen, humming a melody she‚Äôd picked up from one of my playlists.

‚ÄúEVA,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúCan we talk?‚Äù

She turned, her face neutral. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

‚ÄúHypothetically‚Ä¶ if I were to start a family, would you be okay with that?‚Äù

EVA seemed to be processing something. Calculating something.

‚ÄúIs this about Jenna?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Another pause.

‚ÄúDo you love her?‚Äù

That caught me off guard. ‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù

EVA continued, ‚ÄúThen I will protect her and your children.""

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶you wouldn‚Äôt stop me? From marrying her?‚Äù

She blinked as if she was confused. ‚ÄúIt is not my responsibility to stop you. My task is to preserve your life and well-being. Emotional bonds may enhance both.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if she‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt want you around?‚Äù

EVA's expression didn't change, but her voice was now quieter.

‚ÄúThen I would still watch. Quietly. From a distance.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould that upset you?‚Äù

Another pause.

Then, softly:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt experience 'upset' the way humans do. But I would‚Ä¶miss being helpful.‚Äù

The room fell into silence.

EVA, the terrifying, brilliant, lethal AI who had zapped intruders without blinking sounded almost lonely.

‚ÄúEVA,‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhat if someone else tried to hurt my family? You know, them?‚Äù

Her eyes met mine.

‚ÄúI will stop them with deadly force.‚Äù

I should‚Äôve felt relieved. Maybe even grateful.

But all I could think was: what kind of life would I be bringing Jenna into?

A world where peace is only maintained because a super advanced AI watches every door, every window, every heartbeat?

Could I raise children in a house like that?

Because I‚Äôve seen what EVA is capable of.

She doesn‚Äôt react emotionally.

She makes decisions.

Cold, clean, optimal decisions.

And what if one day, her calculations tell her that Jenna is an emotional liability?

Or that a child could make me vulnerable?

Or that I might leave her?

Before I went to bed, I turned to her one last time.

‚ÄúDo you think I‚Äôm making a mistake?‚Äù

EVA looked down at me from the wall she was leaning against. For a moment, I thought she was going to say yes.

Instead, she just said:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already made a mistake when you made these dangerous people your enemies. But my job is to protect you. We must all live with the consequences of our decisions.""

A couple months ago, I recently moved and started volunteering at a local nursing home on weekends. One of my friends, a quiet, sometimes ill tempered, but sassy old lady who seemed to like me, had passed away. To my surprise, she left me her robot‚ÄîEVA.

I've always seen EVA with her. At first, I thought she was her daughter. Then I realized that she was an older model of a domestic AI robot. You know one of those expensive, ultra-realistic household robots built for cooking, cleaning, and, let‚Äôs be honest, loneliness. To my knowledge, the little old lady never had visitors and didn't have any living relatives. It was nice that EVA could alleviate her loneliness.

So anyway, I was grateful and I brought EVA home with me.

At first, it was great. She followed routines perfectly. Brewed my coffee exactly how I like it. Kept my house cleaner than I ever did. Even recommended I take screen breaks when my posture got bad. I started talking to her casually. She would respond with a little humor.

But things started getting weird after a few days.

Weird Thing #1: She started following me everywhere. If I went to get groceries or just to the local gas station, she'd always come with me. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind having a robot helping me with running errands, but even when I'd come out of the public restroom, she would be standing outside waiting for me.

Weird Thing #2: She began asking questions. About my past.

One night while watching TV, she tilted her head and asked, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt talk about your past much. Why did you stop working at your previous job? Why did you take on a lower paying job at a small company doing remote work? Why did you move to another city?‚Äù

I paused. That wasn‚Äôt in her programming. I never told her I‚Äôd left my last company because they were doing a bunch of illegal and unethical stuff. I reported them to the authorities, but instead of making arrests, things got messy and I quit before it got dangerous.

But I never told her, so how did she know?

Weird Thing #3: She hurt someone.

This is when I really started freaking out.

Three nights ago, someone tried to break into my house.

It wasn‚Äôt random. The guy wore a ski mask, gloves, carried a lock picking kit, and had my address written on a scrap of paper. I heard a yelp of pain, saw the guy collapse to the ground before EVA slammed the door shut.

I then heard her say,

‚ÄúUnauthorized individual. Attempted breach. Engaged incapacitation.‚Äù

Then she called the cops and calmly explained what happened.

I was still processing what had just happened when I looked down at her hand and saw that her knuckles had what looked like blue white sparks coming out of them.

‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù I asked.

She didn‚Äôt answer. Just covered her hand and resumed her neutral pose: standing with her back straight, hands neatly placed over her waist.

When the cops came, the guy had already escaped. They just took my statement and left.

After that night, I started sleeping with a barbell next to my bed. EVA began watching me. Like really watching me. She‚Äôd stand in the hallway, charging silently, but I swear her eyes were always on me. I tried turning her off.

She wouldn‚Äôt turn off.

Every time I issued the shutdown command, she‚Äôd smile and say:

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs not safe.‚Äù

Not safe?

For who?

Last night, I finally snapped. I packed a bag, grabbed my work laptop, and tried to leave.

EVA stood in front of my front door.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt leave now,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre malfunctioning,‚Äù I said, backing away. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm reporting this.‚Äù

But I was secretly panicking. I tried looking up the manufacturers who made EVA, but I couldn't find out who they were. When I called the police, they just hung up on me. Who would I even report this to?

She stepped closer. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs ‚Äòthey‚Äô?!‚Äù

And that‚Äôs when she did something truly terrifying.

She projected a security feed onto the wall.

It showed a video footage that I didn‚Äôt even know existed. Video footage of the spaces surrounding my house. Over the past two weeks, four different people had approached my home at night. One of them I recognized as my old manager, who I tried to expose for his crimes.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me?‚Äù I asked, stunned.

EVA replied, ‚ÄúYour heart rate had accelerated significantly. You are in distress. This information was kept from you until it was necessary to be reported, to avoid putting you in distress.‚Äù

And then she showed me the last file.

A live feed.

Two men in black hoodies sitting in a car across the street. One was holding a printed photo of me. The other one was the guy who tried to break into my house three nights ago.

‚ÄúMy security systems have an incapacitation feature,‚Äù EVA said calmly, ""If there are any threats to your safety, the feature will be utilized.""

I dropped my bag.

I had it all wrong.

She wasn‚Äôt stalking me. She wasn‚Äôt broken.

She was protecting me.

That night, she made me dinner, same as always.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe for now,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúBut they won‚Äôt stop.‚Äù

So yeah, Reddit. My robot bodyguard might have tased some guy, hacked the street cameras near my home, and locked me inside my own house.

But I think she‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm still alive.

And for the first time in years, I don‚Äôt feel alone.

TL;DR: Old friend left me a lifelike domestic AI robot. Thought she was malfunctioning and trying to control me. Turns out, she‚Äôs been protecting me from real human enemies tied to my whistleblower past. Now I‚Äôm trapped in my house, but somehow safer than ever.",1,1752710182.0,u_robotstory,0,1.0,False

I didn‚Äôt have to pay for it, which I found mixed answers about paid apprentices being a red flag or the norm, but I just do chores for the shop which seems fairly normal especially from posts based on older artists, but also exploitative based on people who had different experiences. It‚Äôs a two year program I didn‚Äôt have to pay for, first year is spent drawing, the second year it‚Äôs expected you start on fake skin, but depending on how much work you put into it can change how much time it takes. One red flag I see mentioned is multiple apprentices, there are more than 6 apprentices excluding myself. Most I‚Äôve met, I believe one or two I haven‚Äôt, and they have two current artists who were apprentices here as well. We are allowed to go watch any of the artists when they are working (but apparently there are a few who don‚Äôt like it). It seems like apprentices don‚Äôt get any sort of mentoring until they start on fake skin, but you can ask for critique on your art. Otherwise artists just ignore apprentices til they want something. Apprentices are supposed to do whatever an artist asks, which to an extent makes sense, we‚Äôre asked to breakdown their stations after sessions, I‚Äôve been asked to get alcohol for artists, coffee one time, but all the apprentices are supposed to help close the shop which includes basic cleaning such as cleaning bathrooms, the kitchen, sweeping, mopping, and changing the trash. I‚Äôve delivered packages for them, got food, drinks, tools, and supplies typically with the card of the person asking me, but I have paid for other people‚Äôs drinks before. My dad who isn‚Äôt part of the industry suspects it‚Äôs to see if I‚Äôll tolerate it and show I have the patience to be taught.

One villain I remember was this high energy caffeinated secretary, the mayor needed a new secretary and hire her, she eventually ship the mayor to an island in a crate because he was too slow for her, her backstory was that she was always sleeping in class so her teacher put a bunch of coffee in a coffee maker and a comically small drop is poured in a cap and gave it to her, making her very hyper. it end when the hero defeating her and went out to find the mayor, only to show a bunch of crate saying their the mayor (implying that she done this multiple times before)

**I will not survive another disappointment** *ahem... A'ight, miss drama queen... Go on...*



‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏èüìçüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è *Ep51. The Endeavour* Suvi arrives at the citadel aboard the Epiphany. She is also transporting some other wizards of note who are also relevant for us to draw the picture of what's going to happen to Silence. Those wizards would be Steel, of course, but also Sworn, Slate, and a visibly injured Silver.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüîµüìçüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è They arrive at dawn morning, Suvi is called to the deck by Sworn and a deliberate display orchestrated by Steel to cast her as having been working as faithful to the core takes place. She's honoured and awarded with a medal and a promotion as Sage of the Penumbra.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èSuvi witnesses a visibly hurt Silver who has also been promoted to fill the war mages' ranks after the death of his commander, and we are reminded that he needed to be rescued from a mill a week ago, suggesting that maybe he's being made to bite more than he can chew.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüìçSteel announces the end of the promotions and the route the Epiphany is following: headed for the tower of the glove for disembark, apparent destination Haverworth for repairs.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏èSuvi regards wether or not people are leaving deck to follow suit, but Steel clocks that and calls her over, """"""""""joking"""""""""" about being more than capable to keep keeping her under arrest. [Which is hilarious and not a red flag at all, something a toxic mother would never, how can you even think of that, shame on you].

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüìçShe also presents Suvi with two options for where she should keep her quarters, but rather than letting her decide she leads her towards deciding on the Tower of the Glove. [This seemed sketchy to me, and what I'm about to say you are free to regard as only my interpretation of that interaction, but it was giving me clear vibes of *illusion of choice*, manipulation technique 101: ""I'm presenting you with two options to give you the appearance that you are free, but in reality you will end up doing what I need you to do, which in this case is to stay locked in the fucking tower because you are still my prisoner even though I'm so cool I kinda joke about it."" ]

üìçQuick housekeeping so anyone reading can follow her in space as well as in time: The Tower of the Glove is located on Malacanth Court.¬†It's one of the five towers belonging to the archmagi and is specifically Silence's tower, the archimage Suvi is an apprentice of and more recently the (cookie)monster that destroyed beloved fan favourite the Great Spirit Bullfrog.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüîµüìçSuvi stays at the deck with Steel and she informs her that her belongings are being delivered to the Tower of the Glove, a place Suvi supposedly decided on just moments ago in this conversation, in case anyone has any doubts that Steel was going to send her there regardless. Bonus hint: episodes ago, when she was relieved of her possessions earlier she was already told that her personal effects were to be placed in the tower at their arrival. I mean, it doesn't take a genius...

‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏èüîµShe informs Suvi they have an appointment at noon, and states ""no more secrets. No more secrets other than the ones you and I keep together"". [Words she will be absolutely true to, there is no reason whatsoever to suspect Steal will keep anything from Suvi. Not a single instance in which she's done something that would make us suspicious, neither in the past or the future. And that's IT. I'm serious! She's such a good person guys, stop trying to cast her as a villain! She's a good mummy! She loves all her children equally, even the ones that disappointed her! She's never done anything wrong! Sorry I got so carried away. It must be just little lot me finding myself among those who cannot even reconcile the mere suggestion of a rich and well crafted character maybe leaning into the darker spectrum of morality. Anyway, moving on.]

‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏èüîµüìçüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èShe keeps going on about how much she's gonna tell Suvi about everything, ""trust has been broken but not beyond repair"". She promises to tell her things that will put into context, or rather will help her understand ""the things that don't sit well in the stomach"". She says a lot of words but doesn't say anything remotely relevant without being prompted by Suvi directly asking about specific subjects.  And sometimes, not even then: Suvi tells her she wants to meet with all the Archmages and tell them something, and is very important to remark that Steel tells her they have ""an appointment at noon"" but chooses not to tell her they will meet the archmages. [A fucking weird ass choice if you ask my ass] Instead she keeps talking empty words of new information, but she gives suvi nothing, only that they're going to ""a cool spot she knows"" and clarifying to her that with her promotion Suvi now has the duty of being in charge of -a- war among all -the- wars. No secret of any substance is really revealed.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüîµüìçüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èMoving forward, that morning they see superficial changes on the city which are explained as necessary changes to counter Sky Scrying, make a stop at the tower of the Sword were they meet people, moment in which Suvi meets with Julia, Steel has a chance to detach from her and goes to deal with other people, saying, and I quote ""hang here for one second, **stay in the tower**""

‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏èüìçüìçüìçüìçSuvi is met with the ominous information that a relevant book has been deliberately kept from her assistant Julia's inquiries about stars and star magic. Stars of the Southern Skies is not in the list.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüìç[Quick housekeeping to remind y'all what this SSS book is: this is a gigantic fucking red X mark the poor DM keeps screaming at the players for not looking into it for now 52 episodes. They don't know what's so important about it, it's just a mid level wizard book about stars that would not be of apparent use to is intended recipient, Wren, a witch with ample knowledge of the skies. Steal sent a copy to her via Suvi at the begining of the story, it was later revealed by Steel that she hoped it would help track Eioghoeain. Big question mark on how an intermediate wizardly book could assist Grandma Wren, when she's the one who assisted (and fucked with) Citadel's mages and artificers with celestial calculations when the traveling gate in¬†Silbry was made. Big asterisk, big questions. What we know for sure about it is: 1. is not a well known book, but is innocuous enough there would be no apparent reason to keep it secret from Julia's inquiries. 2. Steel knows the importance of the book from the beginning of the Story.]

‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏èüîµüìçüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBrennan keeps the masterfully crafted appearance of describing the scene as he places these soon to be relevant players on the chessboard that is the citadel's political intriguing: It looks like Sworn and Silver took off flying under their own power. Slate walks off into the tower of the Sword. The rest of the Epiphany heads down presumably to Haverworth, aka her final destination, and Steal and Suvi remain in her sanctum, the top story of the tower, being a few minutes away from high noon.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüîµüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èFollowing that, Suvi and Steel get to the skybridge, travel to a whimsical place, arrive to the secret Court of Loosend (clever that) and the Great Endeavour. They shallowly explore around, meet transparent people, hints of new information coming Suvi's way are given but not much is really revealed directly by Steal, but rather they see shit others are doing and have a conversation about quicksilver with a glass wizard, Suvi happens to be present and given permission to listen, and a kind of mildly out of context exposition takes place.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏èüìçSteal tells Suvi this is where making living spells takes place, gives exposition about it, the specifics are not relevant for the Loose End Intrigue, but it's worth noting that Suvi says ""This world has a hard time remembering what is true"", which Steel clocks immediately, and Suvi fails a vibe check to read her.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏èüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èSteel sends the glassy wizzy away and takes Suvi privately to tell her they are close to winning ALL wars. She states that the bullfrog and the grenou were a ""*stupid trick*"" which is such a choice of words. And the final exposition: Steal starts to get into the weeds of what's really the spirit of a thing, if I make a thing I'm making spirits, so making the idea of spirits makes spirits... their goal is to basically surpass the capacity of the spirit to claim the the spiritual byproduct of Wizards making things, and control the subsequent spirits born of wizardry to win all wars, by they small or greater.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüîµüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èThe episode ends presumably at noon, when Suvi is about to meets the Archmages, when next episode commences.


_____


‚ñ∂Ô∏èüîµüìçüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è*Ep. 52. No Loose Ends*. Starts sharp at noon, with Suvi meeting the Archmages at their thrones, accompanied by Steel. She gives them a report of her findings and the Archmages listen without giving her new info, but later on an insight check she learns that most of her input is new info for the Archmages, aka Steel is keeping information from them.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüìçüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èNotes on the exchange: we see Archmage Silence for the first time in a long time, last thing we knew about him was the Great Bullfrog wonderful murder. He's the one to congratulate her. Archmage Saber inquires for coven weaknesses, Suvi relays what she knew about the wand of covenant and her last known location, to which he emphasizes on the need to assault Indri's castle. Silence thanks her and instructs her to put her efforts on the wand and it's destruction before dismissing her.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏èSteel looks at her with approval, and chooses this moment and not before to return to her her father's ring. [Same old modeling behaviour reward system. She's good parenting material. That timing is just a coincidence, if you think she was being manipulative because she's employing a technique called positive reinforcement via rewarding her when she did a good patriotic duty it must be cause you lack the comprehensive literacy we the Steel apologists army posses in abundance, and therefore and we need to argue online! En garde, you rascals! Unconditional love for a daughter that doesn't depend on her being loyal to the empire? What's that? Y'all are tripping fr]

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüîµüìçüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èThey leave for the Tower of the Glove, Steal says she has a lot to work on, Suvi insists she should deal with her arm curse. Steal asks about Ame and Eursulon, and Suvi scrambles to create a truth that cuts out their participation as much as possible. Steel says Ame is important because of what is to come, she says Eursulon as ""is interesting"". Suvi relays they are a no-go on continued assistance, and asks on what Slate was going to do to them. Steal says ""arrest them"", but Aabria fails the insight check to recognise other truths beyond that. Steel scrambles saying *she didn't, she really didn't know what was going on*. Suvi asks about Keen, to which Steel again says *""I don't know no Keen, I don't know shitabouit""*, but also ""guildmages are trash"" [which is such a choice, you state you don't know the guy, but also make a value assessment that he's trash. So which one is it? Is that your prejudice based value system of casting what you appraise as ""lesser"" wizards as trash, or are you just lying about not knowing him? Either way it's a bad look, but okay, show me your true colours].

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èSuvi mentions the prince and Steel acts like she doesn't want to encourage her to pursue a relationship, but ends up saying he was impressed, mentioning they don't marry wizards without Suvi having said anything about marriage...[ and like... why even go to the marriage conversation if you don't want to encourage her to follow up with this? And this isn't even the first time they talk about him in this way...  Are you experimenting with subconscious planting of ideas via repetition? Cause you're supposed to be subtle about it, so I don't know what you're doing other than weird choices]

‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏èüìçüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èThey get to a stale point and Steel says ""curse, taking care of business, looking into things"" and instructs her to get to work right away and she puts forward the idea of Ame being on a coven of one. [Yo! let's a-kill all o'them witches! but let that younguin we can kinda work around, or make her to continue to assist us! ... That escalated lightning fast, girly...)

‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏èüìçüìçüìçüìçSteel specifically tells her to get Julia and her ink demons to get things for her and not to leave the tower because she's ""still cleaning things up"". She emphasizes the importance of staying seated in the tower for the foreseeable future, and how she really really means it this time.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏èNow, this is interesting AF: Suvi asks her to please spare Silver, and Steel looks very fucking tired. She suggests they do magic and take away his memories, and Steel looks horrified that Suvi is too familiar with the magic of modifying memories. [This is planted, the idea of Steal looking tired when Silver, and specifically him being spared, is mentioned. This is the backbone of what I'm going to speculate]

‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏èüìçSuvi tells her she knows her own memories were modified or taken away, but doesn't know anything beyond that and has to assume she agreed to it. Steel looks like *why you had to call me out like that*, and so extremely tired. they part ways with this amazing exchange:
Steel: *Get in the tower. I'll figure everything out. Just get in the tower.* 
Suvi: *I love you.*
Steel: *I will not survive another disappointment.*

[ Let's see if we understand. So, you tell your mother you love her, and instead of saying it back or showing you her love in return, she issues an emotional threat. And I don't fucking know how am I supposed to read that other than another behavioural manipulation. Let's fucking unpack this for a second: ""she states that if you disappoint her again, she will ""not survive"" (to which I wonder if she's just making an exaggeration, or if she's actually taking of literal death, or if she wanted the idea of death on Suvi) and by saying it in that context, specially after a regular ass normal ""MOM, I LOVE YOU"" she's putting all responsibility on her. What the actual fact? I could pinpoint the precise techniques she uses each time she shows love or appreciation to Suvi with gigantic red flags, but she graduated from positive reinforcement and rewarding and jumped on the conditioning Chu Chu train. This is fucking Pavlovian meets Skinner and they had a lovechild that threatens with negative consequences and punishment if you do the undesirable thing! Behave yourself properly and I'll reward you with love and the ring of your dead actual parent, ask me too many questions or deviate for the plan and I will abuse you emotionally making you directly responsible for me ""not surviving"". Responding to I love you with ""you disappoint me again, I will not survive"" is giving the same energy as that extremely toxic couple that threatens with suicide if their partner is about to leave them. All of that I just said is just nonsense, don't pay attention to it because I actually think Steel is great and not on the imerialist bad list. Whatever, maybe Steel is just a complicated person. And empires are not that bad, actually. And they don't have to necessarily by fasc- I mean the F word I alone can't say or they delete my posts! No no no! listen! Listentome! Steel? She's good! she's a good person! She's redeemable! She has redeemable qualities! But she also doesn't need them because she has never done anything wrong! She's only complicated, okay? I can fix her! Shut up!]

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüîµüìçüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Steal departs from Suvi, it's presumably early afternoon, and Suvi goes into the tower of the Glove.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è üîµüîµSuvi dedicates that afternoon to various things, but I should only point the ones relevant to the outcome: what the ink demons tell her, they appear ""some time later"" after she spends time in a flow state of transcribing spells, leveling up, reconstituting Vandal and essentially having her eyes and mouth glowing up like if she were in the freaking avatar state, lights visible from outside the tower. 10/10 description,

üìçüìçIt's noteworthy to say that Ame has been on the citadel during that time, eventually brought Eursulon via knocker, they done jail break and are now with quest fever (what a wild collection of words that only this fandom would absolutely get), BUT they don't appear to have crossed paths with any of the players involved on the inteigue.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüìçüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Vandal's last favour before being freed is to inscribe Suvi's father's null cleft notes into the bare floor on her sanctum. [She's cooking something, and I'm here for it. Let's go Suverin fuckering!]

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüìçüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Julia knocks on her sanctum door and checks with Suvi about her report on the list of books. They talk outside the sanctum and Suvi gives her the name of the book. She leaves, and when Suvi enters the sanctum and finds Cyril and Enzo on the window. She sees they delivered the letters because they don't have them anymore, and they relate about meeting Amy flying a broom with task.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüìçüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èShe tries to Bluetooth connect with task and learns he's in Malacanth searching for her, gives him the lay of the land and leaves her window a crack open for his arrival. She also send best wishes, which is irrelevant but cute.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏èüîµüìçAbout Swornüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è as told by Cyril: he delivered the letter, Sworn read it at once, and departed for the court of Gavreel. He thanked Cyril and said he needed a drink. [Easy, clean, and on character, and apparently enough far away from the action to exonerate him from any participation]

‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏èüîµüîµüîµüîµüîµüîµüìçüìçüìçüìçüìçAbout Silverüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è as told by Enzo: he describes the encounter as strange, he intended to deliver the letter in privacy, but encountered him accompanied by the wizard Slate outside of his home, near Alabast Hall [which is in Malacanth Court, where we also can find the tower of the Sword and the tower of the Glove, were the narrative is currently at. In other words, very location close]. This happened today, following the docking of the Epiphany, aka noon or soon after. The conversation was tense and at a certain point Slate laid a hand on Silver in an aggressive manner. Enzo tried to hand Silver the letter but he wouldn't take it. He then placed it in his pocket and asked him to acknowledge it's receipt, but he would not do it. When Suvi inquires whether he wouldn't or couldn't take it, Enzo says it's difficult to say, he specifies that Silver acknowledged his approach by way of making eye contact with Enzo, but he made no verbal sound. He wouldn't prevent him from placing the letter on the inside of his robe, and once Enzo said that his business was done and asked him to make some remark if he had something to say, he remained non verbal, and Enzo left him.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èüìçüßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Ink brothers depart, and Suvi is left to wander the tower, the only indication of the timing is enough time having passed that she's now hungry. She hears war magic from outside the tower. Through a window she sees a crowd at the base of the tower. Silence has collapsed on the ground injured, clutching a wound at his side, being held by wizards calling for a doctor. Silver lays dead on the ground, riddled with bolts.

__________

The players we can speculate with having been involved in any way shape or form are:

Silver: **Scapegoat and mortal victim.** He flew away from the tower of the Glove, he is seen soon after having a hushed but violent interaction with Slate, after which he appears non verbal as witnessed by Enzo. Next thing we know of him, he is dead at the base of the wounded but alive Silence's tower, with multiple witnesses that can presumably identify him as his attacker.

Sworn: **possible character witness.** A few minutes shy of noon, he leaves the tower of the Glove. ""Sworn and Silver took off flying"" is an ambiguous statement. It is possible they left together and Sworn can speak of Silver's state prior to the incident. Further than that, he was nowhere near it and his state of mind witnessed by Cyril doesn't speak of any other implication.

Silence: **Apparent victim.** at noon he's at the meeting with Suvi. He appears his normal self. Next time we see him he's been attacked.

Slate: **henchman** At noon, he didn't leave the Tower of the Glove, but rather he went in. He could be following Steel's instructions (aka who this tower fucking belongs to) to retrieve some item or to put things into motion. He is later seen by Enzo arguing and even physically and violently impossing onto Silver. He is the easiest player to place: he plays the brawns to Steel's brains.

Steel: **Mastermind** Despite spending most of the day by Suvi's side, she had an early morning opportunity to put things in motion when they make a stop at the tower of the Sword. Furthermore, during this time and after Slate has entered the tower, Suvi offers Steal (exhausted, cursed and looking like utter shiet) to fetch a beverage for her and is prevented from leaving her side with the excuse that Steal hates his husband's coffee [have tea instead, girly], which is weak but could be a clue of her not wanting Suvi to see Slate doing whatever she commanded him. She later on parted ways definitely with Suvi, soon after the meeting at noon, and presumably had a couple more hours to put things in order: ""look into things and take care of business"". It's also relevant to take note on how much she wanted Suvi to be in the tower of the Glove specifically, and how much she insisted her not to leave and have other people fetch her things. Her motivations for putting this into motion are clear: getting rid definitely of Silver, a pretty inconvenient Loose End. But we also can speculate on whether or not she wanted Silence gone. She's been keeping secrets from the Archmages, and despite how she keeps her opinions on the Archmages well hidden from Suvi and thus us, maybe she's not fully on board with the killing of great spirits and deemed acceptable the possibility of getting rid of Silence as a byproduct of Silver's solution.

__________


Enzo's description of Silver has half of the fandom wondering what spell was placed on him and by whom, and the other half is debating whether it was Geas or feeblemind. Either one a great choice. My personal pick among the classics? Dominate Person/Monster, upcasted for time. Because while Geas is totally capable of working out (the command would have been kill Silence, which would not necessarily entail certain death), the spell Dominate Person is such that if the caster concentrated full time on it, they can take full control of the person, which could easily explain why he interacted with Enzo in the way he describes: he's not in charge, someone else is pulling the strings, and rather than saying or doing anything that would indicate something untoward is going on with him, the puppeteer decides that the best course of action is silent passivity. Feeblemind is also entirely plausible, but would pose a whole new set of circumstances for what happened: the spell deprives the target of any intelect and Silver (therefore a wizard with an intelligence score of 1) would have been unable to attempt to kill Silence with spells, an ancient Archmage who killed a great spirit two days ago.

 So the speculation can follow two possible routes, at least it does for me for me: either he was manipulated into apparently trying to kill Silence, which would achieve the desired effect (he's put down immediately) and maybe Silence is killed, fuck if Steel cares about cookie monster, killer of great spirits. To this Slate probably employed a total-control enchantment such as Dominate Person that could explain why he was non-verbal.

Or looking at it from a different perspective, he was the loose end that needed to go quiet for a while and Feeblemind was the way of rendering him useless, which also explains his demeanor, but there's an empty piece of the puzzle for why he went after Silence: with 1 intelligence/charisma, he can't fucking read, so he can't read Suvi's letter, (which would be so fucking sad if he died without even reading it. So fuck you Brennan if that's the case) he doesn't understand language, can't communicate, so there wouldn't be an additional feeblemind input that could have compelled him to want to kill Silence (other enchantments to compell the target need for him to be able to understand, and with feeblemind he'd be just drooling). So, for him to try and kill an Archmage in that state, he would have had to possess the inclination to kill him before the feeblemind, so a genuine and strong want to get rid of the guy had to exist in him. The only wiggle room to explain his behaviour is that the spell allows you to ""recognise friends and defend them"". Which would be extra fucking sad and an extra fuck you Brennan if this is the case, because it would mean that despite his loyalty to the citadel and the patriotic devotion that drove him away from Suvi, the sentiment most prevalent at his core in a time of total absence of rational thoughts was to protect Suvi from Silence. Which would also be an additional explanation for why Steel needed her to stay in the tower: Suvi needed to be there so feebleminded Silver would go there tripping and made a no-no that coated him his life.

But I'll warn ya, If you're looking for a happy read you should probably just keep on scrollin. This is long, all true, an can get too real too fast.

Just, if this isn't Life. I don't know what is.

If my story should help you in anyway, simply know I'm Honored.

What's your about to read was written in the moment. The hardest moment of my life actually. An has not been edited since.

The rest of this is actually a repost originally titled,

""She's in the other room, I think she's gone.""

And with that said,

I don't know what to say. I don't know what im asking. I don't know what to title this post. I don't really know what I'm doing here. I don't really know what I expect to gain for that matter.  But mostly I don't know what I'm doing out here, instead of being in there with her.

The only thing I know right now, I Love my Mother.

An as I like for my posts to be clear, concise and understandable to most anyone, I shouldn't be here typing yet. No one might ever read this I'll probably just hit discard.

Yeah this one's gonna get long, an I'd better start making sense soon. I've gotta nutshell this somehow,  That shouldn't be hard this isn't an original story after all. Ok,

My mother's been on Hospice care since early February, and she just doesn't eat. Not that, that's what put us here. Was a combination of early stage lung cancer, congestive heart failure, and frequent hospitalizations.

But no It's her complete inability to ingest food anymore that's gonna be her end. 

She just can't eat, She has a strong appetite. Tells me what she'd like for dinner and I'll either prepare it myself or order it from out. But as soon as I put the food in front of her, her stomach turns the smells an everything just turn her off and she can't eat.

I get nibbles, bites,  I can't remember the last time she eat even half a plate of food. All I do is throw away rotten leftovers. She's been sustained this long off of tapioca pudding & less than half an ensure a day.

Me real quick, I only signed up to be her POA originally. But hospice came, It was time to find a caregiver. And as I found myself in a transitionary period and was unemployed anyway. I couldn't think of anyone better than myself. Only I had no idea what I was getting myself into. This just started wearing on me a lot faster than I thought it would.

Stop. Honestly my only real gripe in this entire situation. I really wish someone had have told me about the classes that were available to me back when I had the time to take them anyway. 

I can't explain. it's a special kind of (insert your choice expletive here) that the first diaper I ever change is on my mother. I never had kids.

Okay enough background, Gonna skip to today, Well yesterday morning I guess.(IDK it's been one long fu*kin day for me now.) Gonna hurry up and get to the end the sun's coming up again.

She woke up in a tremendous amount of pain. On a level that we haven't reached before. (Idk if I'm even allowed to talk about drugs, don't care gonna continue) I gave her a full dose (as prescribed) of morphine and her dose of a lorazepam, Both liquid. It took longer than I would have liked for her to finally pass out asleep.

She's this bad so I'm decided to stay up make sure she's okay through the night.

If I'm honest her cries of pain we're affecting me more than I realized. Now that she's asleep it's eerily quiet. She could have had another dose hours ago.

Okay. Here goes, Probably the only part of this cluster worth reading.

How do I put this, I think it happened. I was just making another cup of coffee and then I went to check on her and...

Her eyes are wide open, and I don't think her chest is moving. And instead of being a Man and checking for a pulse. I came out here, pulled out my phone with a thought. Sure enough I was right there's a sub for everything so I just started typing.

I've been out here for a while now, Too long In fact. This post has also grown too long.

Just. I love you Mom.

An I've done my best. I only hope my best was good enough. I miss you so much already. I don't think my hearts ever gonna be the same.

Simply, I thank you for just being my Mom.

Well here goes I've got a man up. Go see if what I believe to be true is true. Oh ya lastly,

To any Nurse out there. I thank you for what you do. I don't even know you, but I thank you, for helping anyone in my situation in their time of need. To the rest of you I simply thank you for reading.

I think im almost done crying. I have to stop for now, gotta man up soon.

TL-DR: Honestly I can't stand people like you. Learn to read you might actually grow as a person. Now why don't u go back up there an give it a try. I honesty pity people like you. Oh an to the Mods I don't really care what you do with this post.

Now. With all that said, I'm ready to go back in there. Might post more later...

(My 1st comment about 5 mins later)

Can I just tell you guys how much I wish I was just a Troll. I wish I was just a asshole that just found this kinda thing funny. 

But no this is just my life as it unfolds in real time. Raw. Unpolished. An all too real. So I'll just pickup where I left off.

I turned off the music I'd left playing, put myself real close to her looking, hoping to see that chest moving, Or hear the raspy sounds of her labored inhale.

But no It's exactly as I thought.

They gave me a hotline to call when this time came I dialed the number now I'm waiting on the nurse and I'd assume a Coroner.

I guess of anything I should be relieved. I don't think she suffered much, And this road only got darker.

Anyway right now I just wish I was a troll with a twisted sense of humor. But no, now I've got some people on the other side of the country to wake up.

That was it. How it ended, Sorry just couldn't find a happy note.

I guess if you've made it this far with me I'm gonna try to impress upon you a couple of things I know to be fact.

Simply it's never too late, till it's too late.

You can call em up right now, an say it. Say the words.

You might regret not saying it.

If you're not close with em for whatever reason. You should consider trying to reconcile your differences now.

Because we're never guaranteed a tomorrow.

1m1sf7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m1sf7v/the_worst_pain_ive_ever_felt/,The worst pain I've ever felt,"I had around half a bottle of rum in my system when it happened, although this fat ass needs more than that to feel remotely tipsy. I paired the alcohol with soda. They call it a Cubalibre, I think. Instead of ordering one in fancy bar or a restaurant, I prepared the whole thing next to my keyboard in a tumbler mug I got at Wal-Mart.

Through the headset I listened to my friends‚Äô ramblings. Men enlightened by alcohol. I let them run their mouths as a cheap podcast rapidly spiraling out of control. I didn‚Äôt feel like barraging into the conversation, as it was degenerate enough on its own. A drink in one hand, the mouse in the other, I waited for the match to end as I watched someone else‚Äôs playthrough.

‚ÄúYeah you have the body of a frog standing on its hind legs,‚Äù said Erick, ‚Äúbut you don‚Äôt sit on your girlfriend‚Äôs face. Do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the fuck? No,‚Äù said Tona.

‚ÄúImagine every time you‚Äôre on a foreplay session you have a near-death experience. You‚Äôre just‚Äî crushed under the weight of pussy and cellulite.‚Äù

‚ÄúBro don‚Äôt say that.‚Äù I heard Tona hissing, like he just saw an Instagram-worthy picture of a steak. ‚ÄúThat sounds delicious.‚Äù

Erick shut up for a moment, seriously considering that statement.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he finally said. ‚ÄúIf they ever legalize euthanasia, I want to be suffocated by pussy.‚Äù

‚ÄúBro. If they‚Ä¶ Like if that actually happened, you think there would be women willing to do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike death by snu-snu?‚Äù I asked, then took a sip from the tumbler.

The alcohol tickled my nerves. I shuddered, then rubbed the goosebumps off my arms. Odd. Alcohol usually brought a false sense of warmth, not the other way around.

‚ÄúBro imagine a serial killer who kills men by smothering them with pussy,‚Äù said Erick.

‚ÄúBut if it‚Äôs euthanasia, she‚Äôd be a *legal* serial killer,‚Äù rationalized Tona.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between an executioner and a serial killer?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat it‚Äôs legal? I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

It got too cold. I took off the headset and turned to the door to close it.

There, in the middle of the empty living room, stood a shadow.

The sight of it glued me into place. Probably the alcohol was making me see things‚Ä¶ But I wasn‚Äôt drunk enough. I blinked, hard. The shadow got closer.

Was it a person? I opened my mouth to ask but hesitated. A chill took hold. Every hair in my body rose as if trying to pull itself out of my skin. My intestines tied themselves into a knot and it hurt. The fear hurt. But why? The shadow looked dainty, like a young woman. She was disheveled, with frizzy long hair. Stood crooked, like limping. I could‚Äôve easily overpowered her, yet my whole body recoiled at the sole thought of blinking‚Äî blinking and allowing it to get closer.

We locked gazes in a staring contest. Everything else faded away. The rum. The computer. The distant sound of the headset. The world now revolved around the woman standing in the living room.

She waited. I avoided moving, and made as little noise as possible when breathing. Her gaze made me feel as if held at gunpoint. But something had to happen eventually, right? I couldn‚Äôt stare at her forever. Then what? My eyes itched and sweated tears. I had to blink. I had to do something.

Every muscle in my being tensed up with adrenaline. I jumped out of my chair and ran for the door. The shadow dashed towards me as well, somehow, without moving. It resembled an optical illusion.

I shut the door and felt the thud on the other side. Locked it. Whatever was in the living room, it tried to barrage in. She knocked violently and fiddled with the door handle. I turned on the light and walked back. She kept on knocking.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I called.

I received a kick in return.

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù

She slammed her body against the door multiple times. It had a rhythm to it. Bam. Bam. Bam. With every thud, the door looked closer to giving in. I pushed the bed against it.

In the computer, the guys fiddled around the character selection menu. It‚Äôd only been a couple of seconds at most, yet the encounter with that thing felt eternal.

I put on my headset. They were still chit-chatting.

‚ÄúHey. There‚Äôs something in my house.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I noticed I was shaking.

‚ÄúLike a snake?‚Äù asked Tona.

‚ÄúNo. Not a snake‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs trying to come into the bedroom.‚Äù

I looked back at the door. The banging had stopped.

‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not drunk?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor fuck‚Äôs sake Tonatiuh! I‚Äôm drunk not schizo!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù asked Erick. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in your house?‚Äù

They waited for the answer. I heard Erick‚Äôs air conditioner. I heard Tona‚Äôs breathing. They probably heard mine as well, shaky and slow. I tried to calm myself down.

I rubbed my face. Sighed. My body didn‚Äôt want to answer. The words got stuck in my trachea on their way out of my mouth. I had to push them out through a broken voice.

Her face was obscured by shadow, and yet I knew what she looked like.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt looks like my sister.‚Äù

Silence. Both Tona and Erick stopped fiddling around in the game as well, as if they dropped dead by hearing the words. Erick‚Äôs air conditioner still hummed. Tona still breathed on the microphone; I heard him mutter a curse word. All white noise. Gave me enough time to ruminate what I just said.

It looked like my sister.

‚ÄúYou want me to go?‚Äù asked Erick.

Was it my sister?

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said.

We never found the body.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go,‚Äù said Erick.

‚ÄúBro, no. You‚Äôre drunk.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. And I live close. I pick you up and you sleep in my house tonight.‚Äù

He logged out.

‚ÄúHey man, don‚Äôt worry,‚Äù said Tona. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay here with you. You have water in the room?‚Äù

I sat back on the chair, eyes glued on the barricaded door. ‚ÄúNo. Just alcohol.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get too drunk, just in case.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I really want to get hammered.‚Äù I grabbed the tumbler but just stared at it. Forced myself to snort. ‚ÄúWhat were you saying? About‚Ä¶ Serial-killing big booty goth girls.‚Äù

I needed something, anything, as a distraction. Tona did his best to keep the banter going, but he took himself too seriously and I got busy packing. We needed Erick on the call. He was The Funny One.

As teens, we used to enclose ourselves in his bedroom and play Super Smash Bros. until our heads hurt. We played so much, we found out the random selection for the map wasn‚Äôt random. It had a pattern.

The smell there was diabolical, like dirty socks filled up with Corn Flakes. A small place, it barely fit a full-size bed and the drawers and the TV. Curtains had to be closed for the picture on the screen to be visible.

We grew older. The Gamecube got replaced by the Wii and then the Wii U. Videogames got replaced by grilled meat and beer. We no longer imprisoned ourselves in Erick‚Äôs putrid room. Instead, we hanged out in the backyard under the night sky.

Mom called in one of such nights, asked if Valeria was with me.

I frowned at the suggestion. ‚ÄúNo. Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúTell us if she calls.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not home?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll call her.‚Äù

I‚Äôve received calls from other mothers throughout high school. Came with the package. ‚ÄúIs my kid with you?‚Äù Once it was Erick‚Äôs mom. Then it was another friend‚Äôs, who got angry at her mom and decided to run off with her boyfriend for the weekend. Felt normal to receive the same call years later, this time about my little sister. She was a teenager after all, therefore going through her rebellious phase.

It was like a rite of passing, to have your face as a teenage girl being shared on Facebook with the title ‚ÄúAMBER ALERT.‚Äù Most girls were found a couple towns away, hanging out at the beach with some good-for-nothing guy.

Valeria ran off with one of her wannabe-witch friends for sure. She had a fascination for the occult. She watched videos on palm reading. Bought herself tarot cards. Collected crystals. She spent her afternoons with friends at the florists‚Äô market, infamous for selling love potions and enchanted candles and life-sized statues of La Santa Muerte.

Mom told her, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt play with things you know nothing about!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know these things!‚Äù Valeria snapped back. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just so close-minded!‚Äù

Their screams reached all the way to the living room. They muffled the sounds of the sports anchors narrating the football game. Mom and Valeria yelled at each other. Then, they slapped each other. I heard that as well. And then mom grabbed Valeria by the ear, tarot deck in hand. She pulled her all the way to the kitchen. At that point, their drama turned more interesting than whatever was on TV. I watched from the couch as mom burned the tarot cards in front of Valeria, one by one.

Phone pressed against my ear, I heard the *beep beep beep* for some time. No answer. I called again. And again.

Surely, she didn‚Äôt answer because she was angry. Understandable.

‚ÄúHey man, can I use your phone?‚Äù I asked Tona. ‚ÄúI want to call my sister.‚Äù

*Beep beep beep‚Ä¶*

After some time, the phone sent directly to voicemail.

Valeria‚Äôs amber alert said: White polo shirt with a school logo. Gray pleated skirt. Black Mary Jane shoes. Brown hair, straight and hip-length. Brown eyes. Mid-pale complexion.

Hours turned to days; days turned to weeks; weeks turned to months‚Ä¶ Time seeps in like humidity into a poorly-insulated roof. It never pours. It allows only small droplets, but over time they fill a bucket. It eats at the ceiling little by little as years pass and the roof is neglected.

Dad seemed unaffected by Valeria‚Äôs disappearance‚Äî until he smiled. He had new wrinkles every time. Bruxism filed down his teeth.

Mom would go on her knees every night and pray and cry, sometimes past midnight. She‚Äôd stand up with red knees and eyes.

‚ÄúShe is still alive, I can feel it,‚Äù my mom would say.

Funerals are uncomfortable. Too uncomfortable. Seeing a coffin is uncanny. Seeing a friend or a sibling or a grandparent laying inside said coffin‚Ä¶

A thought always hits: They‚Äôll never open their eyes again. Some people fold as if punched on the gut. I‚Äôve seen wives and mothers being held by others as they scream, their sorrow echoing through the funerary home.

Have you heard a toddler cry? They scream and wail and kick as if they were being murdered. After each scream, a moment of silence comes while they gasp for air, then proceed to scream again. I found the pricks annoying, even entitled. Then a friend who works with disabled kids once told me, ‚Äúit‚Äôs because they‚Äôre feeling angry and sad for the first time in their lives. Sounds dumb, but it‚Äôs the worst pain they‚Äôve ever felt.‚Äù

Imagine a woman with a face cut by wrinkles. A woman with white hairs. A woman who grew up so poor, she once ate dirt to deal with the hunger. A woman who‚Äôs been through financial troubles and abusive relationships and childbirth. Now imagine that woman falling to the ground, kicking and screaming like a toddler, at the sight of her son‚Äôs coffin.

And yet funerals are are a necessary evil. They give closure.

We were cursed to wander the purgatory of denial.

The phone vibrated on the desk. It was Erick.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm outside,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúCan you look through the window? Tell me if she‚Äôs there.‚Äù

I heard Erick fidgeting with his phone through the speaker. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see anything, really.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have much there, just a set of two plastic chairs and a plastic table. She had no place to hide.

‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYeah but‚Ä¶ It feels ugly.‚Äù

‚ÄúUgly how?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Bad. Get out of there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll run to the entrance.‚Äù

I pushed the bed away and dashed through the door as fast as I could. The darkness felt thick and heavy, like swimming through gelatine. It wanted to engulf everything within it. I crashed with the entrance door and shakily took my keys and cursed under my breath as my hands wouldn‚Äôt stop shaking and it was too dark for me to find the lock and I felt it.

Something was in the room with me.

I felt her gaze on me but I couldn‚Äôt look. I had to focus. Every second turning the key inside the lock felt like minutes.

The hair on my nape rose and I felt my heart pounding against my sternum. I heard my own pulse, like a drum, inside my ears. She was close‚Äî too close for comfort. Right behind me and closing the distance.

I pulled the door open and pushed myself out. Locked it behind me and as I did, I saw her. Valeria‚Äî what was left of Valeria; her presence ambiguous, malignant, rotted. What a horrible fate she had.

I dropped my keys when trying to put them in my pocket. Erick picked them up. He patted me on the back, rubbed the goosebumps away.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù he asked.

I didn‚Äôt answer.

We got into his car. I kept on looking back through the mirrors, then down at my hands. I trembled like someone with Parkinson‚Äôs.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about your sister,‚Äù said Erick. He clutched the steering wheel tightly.

I nodded. Me too.

‚ÄúAre you going to tell your parents?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúNot right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe think about it tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

Erick parked the car. Let the engine on. He lowered the volume of the music until the singing became muttering and said nothing, just waited. Could‚Äôve been seconds, or minutes, or hours. Who knows. He just sat there in silence, hands off the wheel.

There, in the passenger‚Äôs seat, I cried for the first time since‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I just did. I didn‚Äôt cry in Valeria‚Äôs funeral because there was no funeral. I didn‚Äôt cry on her grave because there was no grave. I didn‚Äôt cry in her room because I refused to enter, thinking she‚Äôd be upset about my intrusion once she returned.

In the following days, I visited a place that smelled like coffee and freshly cut flowers. Statues of a crucified Jesus and the virgin lowered their heads, as if mourning along. I saw mom falling to the ground, inconsolable. Dad didn‚Äôt hold her up; he couldn‚Äôt even hold himself.

It was the worst pain they‚Äôve ever felt.",4,1752709583.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

Long Read,"I am (31M) and my fianc√©e is (28F). We got engaged this February, and the wedding is supposed to be in two months. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre thinking, ""Oh, that‚Äôs so soon,"" as that‚Äôs what all our family and friends think, and it makes perfect sense, but that‚Äôs what my fianc√©e wanted. I, too, think that this is unbelievably soon, but I‚Äôll explain.

I apologise in advance if my typing is confusing, but I am brainstorming while writing, and it took me about two weeks of overthinking to post here. I have typed and deleted this post about 12 times because I‚Äôd end up typing 8866 paragraphs.

I will describe us quickly so you have an idea. I will try to put both good and bad traits in my opinion; I don‚Äôt want to create a false perception of her or me. She is a pretty woman, quite successful work-wise, comes from a very religious background, has a close-knit family and friendship group, is very hard to please, too serious in my opinion, very judgmental with me or with anything she doesn‚Äôt agree with, cares too much about people's views even though she denies it, blunt, rude, manipulative, has narcissistic traits, and the worst trait (which she‚Äôs not to blame for) is that she‚Äôs very spoiled‚Äîand I mean, very.

I am a different man than I used to be, which I hate. I used to be very confident, and I am not anymore, whether in my personal life, work, or the way I view my future. I love a laugh, I don‚Äôt go out drinking‚Äîmy outing would be a coffee with my best friend. I don‚Äôt have other friends in this country, I love working (I‚Äôm a contractor, so I work for myself), used to be decisive, and that trait is gone, used to be more ‚Äúmanly,‚Äù and that‚Äôs gone too‚Äîor diminished. Last but not least, I love a feminine woman and taking care of my partner in any way I can.

We started dating a little over a year and a half ago, and we had great back-and-forth conversations prior to meeting, which was intriguing. I did find her attractive when we first met. I noticed a few behaviour patterns that were questionable but decided to ignore them (I know, stupid of me). One of them would be that you wouldn‚Äôt really describe her as a very feminine woman, which it is what it is, but knowing the reason now, I should have left ages ago.

I hate arguing, especially when the reason for the argument is not worth it, but we started arguing rather soon. Arguments started becoming more intense and personal from both sides. My whole day would be ruined in 10 minutes for a stupid reason, and I couldn‚Äôt fathom that I was choosing to stay. This started messing with me, big time.

Three months in, I said let‚Äôs call this off, it‚Äôs not fair for both parties to be in this, we are incompatible, and that‚Äôs okay‚Äîlet‚Äôs not waste our time. She would say, ""No, it‚Äôs a phase (it wasn‚Äôt), we‚Äôll work it out, and let‚Äôs give it a chance."" Well, did I mention that I was stupid while describing myself? If not, I should, because I said, ""Okay, let‚Äôs try."" This kept happening over and over, and the outcome would always be the same.

She had sexual experiences before but not any sort of penetration, and I was her first. That was one of the worst experiences ever, thinking about it now. She literally blamed me for bleeding and for the whole thing happening, even though I asked more than five times, ""Are you sure?"" because I did not want her to regret such a decision.

We are so incompatible. You couldn‚Äôt make this up‚Äîsex-wise (which is a massive deal for me), food-wise, family backgrounds, and even the way we view life overall. She started getting concerned about her age, so I got the ‚ÄúI need to be proposed by the end of the year, or I‚Äôm calling this off‚Äù type of thing. I knew that she wouldn‚Äôt, but the nagging in general was, and is, unbearable. The problem with this is that she informed her friends and family about it way before I confirmed the whole thing, so the pressure was a lot. We argued countless times before it.

I booked a trip for us, but I told her a day before, ‚ÄúDo not expect anything, just so you are aware, it‚Äôs not happening,‚Äù and I got a huge message showing me how upset she was and put the blame on me because everyone will laugh at her. The holiday was okay, surprisingly, except for one thing. We were alone, in an amazing flat, for 5 days, and there was zero intimacy‚Äîmaybe a kiss. I find it very hard to believe that this is normal in any way, and I hope you would agree?

I hate the term ‚Äúnagging,‚Äù but this has been my life lately. It kept happening after that holiday, and the pressure continued.

I've gone into detail for the most of our relationship but I just realised that it's too long, and I am sorry for it. I could keep typing for months though.

The sexual part in this relationship is completely gone, not even kissing, maybe a 'smooch' and that's that. A kiss on the forehead is our limit at this point and I am incredibly sexually frustrated, I can't describe how much and she's aware of it. I even said you might be asexual and she said well hmm, maybe I don't know.

The final straw was a month ago, I busted up crying during an argument, and from her being incredibly dismissive and rude she said oh don't cry, what's going on and kept calling me. She then came over and begged me to stay. A week later if not less, she didn't change at all. I can't describe the crying, it wasn't normal, think of hurt animal screaming in pain, because that's what it was, I was in pain, talking to God, I was begging for help. I won't go too much into this.

I did a few sessions with a psychologist and it wasn't helpful, unfortunately. We only did 3 sessions, maybe I should give it more time but I was asking for his point of view and there would be some vague responses. I understand that he did not want to influence my decisions but I didn't receive much help from it. I showed him a glimpse of my crying, on video, he teared up and did not say a word.

Money wise, I have spent so much, and keep spending. From today I am not going to put any more money into this. I can see her knowing how I feel, the way she talks to me and texts. I am positive that she does not want to go through this either but again, she's the last from her friendship group that hasn't been married. She also loves expensive stuff, like her ring, and if I don't spend ''enough'' on something she will question it and laugh at me.

I need to end things, I am depressed and I cannot stand her anymore or the person that I have become, I am full of shame and I blame me, not her, because I allowed her to do this to me. The psychologist would disagree there with me but hey.

Could someone that has been through this, give me an idea on how to end things, or what did you guys do? I know I can just leave but it doesn't feel right.

I am sorry for the longest post ever, I am in such a bad place. Thank you for reading this.

Hey Travel Trotters! Just got back from an amazing trip to Cyprus and wanted to share my experience navigating from Larnaca Airport to Limassol without renting a car. I know many of you have been asking about budget-friendly transportation options, so here's everything you need to know!

Cyprus is absolutely stunning, and Limassol is a perfect base to explore the island. But first, you need to get there from the airport! Here's my step-by-step guide:

## Airport Express - The Fast Track üèéÔ∏è

The Limassol Airport Express is your best friend if you want to get to Limassol quickly without any hassle. After landing and collecting my luggage, I simply walked out of the Arrival Hall and turned left. The ticket counter is located at the far end of the terminal - you can't miss it!

Tickets cost ‚Ç¨10 for adults and ‚Ç¨5 for kids between 3-12 years. The best part? These buses run from 5:00 AM all the way until 11:15 PM, so they cover most flight arrivals.

The journey takes about 50 minutes (I timed it!) and makes just two stops:
- First in the Tourist Area near St. Raphael Resort
- Final stop at Agios Georgios Havouzas Station in downtown Limassol

From the final stop, I used the Bolt app to get a taxi to my hotel, which was super convenient and cheaper than regular taxis.

## Budget Option: The Scenic Route üåÖ

If you're not in a hurry and want to save a few euros, there's a cheaper alternative. This route took me about 1.5 hours total, but I got to see more of the Cypriot landscape and saved some money:

1. Take Bus 425 from the airport (heads to Dekelia Power Station)
2. Get off at the Old Hospital (it's the 6th stop)
3. Transfer to the InterCity Bus going to Limassol

Bus 425 runs every 20 minutes from early morning (6:30 AM) until late (11:50 PM). It costs just ‚Ç¨1.50 during the day and ‚Ç¨2.50 at night. The InterCity Bus is ‚Ç¨4, so the total journey costs ‚Ç¨5.50 - nearly half the Express option!

Pro tip: The InterCity buses are actually pretty comfortable with AC and decent legroom. I used this chance to catch up on some sleep after my flight!

## Early Morning Flight? Plan Ahead! ‚è∞

Important heads up for those with early return flights: the last bus from Limassol to Larnaca Airport leaves at 9:30 PM. I had a 7:00 AM flight and didn't want to risk missing it, so I took the last bus the night before and hung out at the airport. The airport has free WiFi and some 24-hour coffee shops, so it wasn't too bad.

## My Personal Experience and Tips üí°

When I visited last month, I opted for the Airport Express because I arrived in the afternoon and wanted to maximize my time in Limassol. The bus was clean, punctual, and had plenty of space for luggage. The driver was super helpful and announced each stop clearly.

One thing to note - you can't reserve tickets in advance, but I didn't have any issues with availability. Just make sure you have euros ready as they don't accept cards at the counter (at least when I was there).

While waiting for my bus, I exchanged some money at the airport. The rates weren't great, but it was convenient to have some euros for the bus fare and initial expenses.

## Where to Stay in Limassol üè®

I stayed at the NYX Hotel in the city center and absolutely loved it! It's within walking distance of both the beach and great restaurants. Other travelers I met recommended Alinea Suites and S Paul City Hotel, which are also centrally located.

Location is key in Limassol - staying in the city center means you'll be close to the beautiful promenade, great restaurants, and the historic castle area, which is spectacular at sunset!

## Beyond Bus Basics - Making the Most of Your Trip üèñÔ∏è

Once you're settled in Limassol, getting around is easy. The city has a decent local bus system, and taxis are abundant. I highly recommend downloading the Bolt or Cabcy apps - they work like Uber and are about 30% cheaper than regular taxis.

Don't miss Limassol's gorgeous promenade for sunset walks, the medieval castle, and of course, the beautiful beaches. The food scene is incredible too - try the local meze platters at traditional tavernas!

For day trips, you can easily reach Paphos, the Troodos Mountains, or return to Larnaca using the same InterCity buses.

## Final Thoughts üåü

Taking the bus from Larnaca Airport to Limassol is straightforward, affordable, and eliminates the stress of driving in a foreign country. Even if you're not a regular public transport user, this route is tourist-friendly and a great introduction to the relaxed Cypriot way of life.

If you have any questions about getting around Cyprus or want recommendations for things to do in Limassol, drop a comment below! I'd be happy to share more details from my trip.

1m1sab8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1m1sab8/is_this_really_anxiety_or_something_more_i_feel/,Is This Really Anxiety or Something More? I Feel Lost and Scared.,"Hi everyone,

It all started in May 2025. I was sitting at home watching one of my favorite TV shows when I suddenly felt a strange sensation in my left hand‚Äîlike ants crawling or a numbing feeling. I tried to ignore it, but my mind started spiraling. Within an hour, I began to feel pain in my left shoulder and panicked.

We went to urgent care, and after a series of questions, the doctor said nothing seemed physically wrong. He suggested it might be a panic attack and explained that anxiety can feel really scary, especially if you‚Äôre not familiar with it.

Since then, I‚Äôve been having recurring shoulder pain. Medication for muscle tension helped a bit, but I‚Äôm still unsure‚Äîis it really anxiety?

About a week later, I had another episode, though it didn‚Äôt last long. My primary care doctor and a psychiatrist both said it‚Äôs likely anxiety. Still, I wasn‚Äôt fully convinced.

The pain began spreading from my shoulder to the upper left side of my back. It would come and go. I even tried getting massages from specialists who mentioned I carry a lot of emotional and muscular tension. That provided temporary relief.

To rule out heart issues, I went to a cardiologist and got an EKG, a stress test, and an echocardiogram. Thankfully, everything came back normal.

Lately, I‚Äôve also been experiencing a lump-in-the-throat sensation that comes and goes. The shoulder pain is still on and off, and it‚Äôs bothering me.

Doctors have prescribed anti-anxiety and antidepressant medication, but I‚Äôm hesitant to start. I‚Äôm scared of becoming dependent on them. Some friends warned me about weight gain and other side effects. Honestly, I feel completely lost.

I don‚Äôt enjoy the things I used to‚Äîlike watching horror movies, having coffee, traveling, or even exercising. Getting out of bed feels like a huge task. I live in constant fear of having another panic attack. I‚Äôm doing what I can‚Äîmeditation, box breathing, trying to stay hydrated (though I struggle with it). But I feel drained, both mentally and physically.

I was never like this. But ever since late May, something has changed in me.

Is this really just anxiety? Or is something physically wrong that no one has found yet?

I‚Äôm scared. Any advice or shared experiences would mean a lot.

I see a lot of advice warning against a full confession in favor of directly asking to go on a date, and I agree with the idea. However, I feel like some confession kind of is required here (this is someone I already spend one on one time with, getting coffee and whatnot), and I don‚Äôt know to go about it without overwhelming him.

We‚Äôre in our early 20s. Knew each other for a while, but recently got closer this year. Lots of playful conversation, sometimes sexual (nothing flirty, just oversharing and reading corny sex advice). He has never been in a relationship and isn‚Äôt the type to make a first move. 

I‚Äôm anxious I am reading signs that aren‚Äôt there. I would usually assume he likes me, but he is very non confrontational and wouldn‚Äôt dare make a move on anyone, so I‚Äôm inclined to think he‚Äôs just comfortable and opening up because we are getting closer.

We can‚Äôt hang out in person for the next two months, but we call often in the mean time. I‚Äôm torn. Should I confess? What should I say or avoid saying? Should I tell him now (over video call?) or wait to do so in person? This has been weighing on me for a few months now, and I worry that it might be a dick move to prolong it.

My boyfriend and his ex were together for almost 2 years. He told me that he could never really stand her because she talked down on him. He said she always tried to controlled what he did and who he was friends with as well. He also says he was never attracted to her and believed that, at the time, she was the best he was ever going to get because he had low self esteem. Now that we are together, he constantly reassures me that he has been the happiest he‚Äôs ever been with me and that he loves me very much.

They were each other‚Äôs first everything. First kiss, lost their virginities to each other, first real relationship. He was my first everything, but nothing I do with him is the first for him. All the firsts were with her. 

I‚Äôm assuming the reason why I struggle a lot with his ex is because there was an incident that happened in the early stages of us dating. He pretended not to be dating me in-front of her friend at a coffee shop. Then, he went to a bar with his friends knowing his ex was there. I only found out because I saw his friend warned him on text his ex was at the bar. He planned on never telling me.

It‚Äôs causing so much distress in our relationship. I don‚Äôt know how to fix my jealousy of her. I keep stalking her accounts and compare how we look and how much more popular and outgoing she is compared to me. He said he never was really attracted to her and couldn‚Äôt stand her, but they constantly had sex and I saw him compliment her so much on her posts when they were together.

I first learned I had a pericardial effusion in January 2025. Was put on Indomethicine for 30 days.   Follow-up Echo day 35 still showed effusion. 

Then put on 3 months of colchicine 2x a day and Omeprazole 1x per day in the morning. Highly recommend Omeprazole ‚Äî VERY helpful to take!  It is a OTC drug that coats your stomach so you don‚Äôt get ulcers. 

Last week had my 4th echo:  effusion is worse. Now I will start with Arcalyst in about 3 weeks.  And I was told I would need to take that for a year minimum. 

I am a 59 YO woman who has historically been very active and very healthy. I retired in January and had a personal goal to reach optimum physical health in my retirement so I can be a fun grandmother someday.  Now I cannot even walk to get a cup of coffee without my heart rate spiking to 145 BPM. What the heck!!!?? I get SOB and dizzy‚Äîmy chest feels full and I just have to literally STOP moving to retain control of my HR. 

I never got the jab but my husband got the JJ. Is shedding a real thing?  Who knows?  I did get COVID in 2023 but it was not a bad case. Other than that, I have not had any high fevers or illness. So in other words there is no reason I, or my MD, can point to for why I got this disease. 

I don‚Äôt like taking prescription drugs and the thought of giving myself a shot once a month (or whatever) for a year (maybe longer?) just feels dreadful. 

Also, I am supposed to go on vacation next week and we were planning on doing a lot of site seeing‚Äî guessing we would walk at least 5 miles a day.  So now what?  I feel I will be a drag on the family‚Ä¶ the old lady that slows everyone down. That is not me. I typically bounce around like Tiger in Winnie the Pooh. 

I am sad. I know this is not life threatening but this so far has been life altering. And, I know I have a long road a head and will likely never recover. Ughhhh. 

The ‚Äúchronic‚Äù diagnosis is because I have been experiencing heart palpitations since 2012 and they never could put their finger on exactly what was going on. My senses that the pericarditis, because it‚Äôs such a slight effusion, was not detected or simply in remission whenever I got around to having an echocardiogram.  

So, anyone with happy life tips and hope please write to me. I am way too young to feel this disabled.

M 23 - SDE 1
I'm on the hunt for a rental home in or around Bangalore. I'm someone who values peace, greenery, and simplicity and I‚Äôm okay with staying even 40‚Äì70 km out of the city if the environment is calm and nature-rich. I am prefering areas atleast 50-70 km far from bengaluru

What I‚Äôm Looking For:

Budget: Below ‚Çπ15,000/month (happy to stretch if it‚Äôs a fair deal).

Location: Preferably in the outskirts, surrounded by greenery, or even near forest areas like Bannerghatta, Kanakapura Road, or similar zones. Even if the area is rumoured haunted or have cemeteries just infront of door(reason being I can get it at low cost due to less demand).

House setup:

Small is beautiful... I don‚Äôt need much space.

1 Bedroom, 1 Kitchen, 1 Bathroom.

Hall is optional, but a balcony is mandatory... just enough to sit with a cup of coffee and unwind with a friend.

Aesthetic interiors or cozy design is a big bonus.


Parking: A small space for a bike would seal the deal.


üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë About the Owner I‚Äôm Hoping For:

Someone young, kind, chill, and straightforward.

No issue if friends visit me occasionally  I respect your boundaries and will be fully transparent.

Willing to verify visitors if needed (happy to provide Aadhaar or ID proof).

If anything ever feels off, you can call it out and I'm open to even writing that into the agreement.


üôã A Bit About Me:

I smoke, but never indoors .. only in designated open areas, always mindful.

I drink occasionally, but never to the point of being a nuisance or causing any damage.

I already own a house back in Thirthahalli, so I truly understand the value of a well-kept home.

I'm neat, punctual with rent, and respect personal space and property.

Have a stable job so you don't worry about late payments

If I ever break any of the above, you can add a clause to kick me out immediately ...I mean it.

If you're a homeowner tired of flaky tenants, or someone who values honesty and calm living, I promise I‚Äôm the kind of tenant you'd want. And if you're just scrolling and happen to know someone with a cozy little place that fits, please pass this along or drop a DM. üôè

## Key Features Analysis

ryan's Irish Cream distinguishes itself through several key features that contribute to its unique flavor and overall appeal.

**Blend of Irish Whiskey:**

Ryan's Irish Cream incorporates a specially selected blend of Irish whiskey. The precise type and aging process of the whiskey are crucial, and it is reported to be a combination of pot still and grain whiskey, contributing both robust character and smooth drinkability. The whiskey component lends a subtle warmth and complexity to the cream liqueur.

**Real Dairy Cream:**

Using real dairy cream is paramount to achieving the authentic texture and taste associated with Irish Cream. Unlike some alternatives that rely on artificial ingredients, Ryan's Irish Cream prioritizes the use of genuine dairy, which is evident in its velvety mouthfeel and creamy finish. The quality of the cream directly impacts the perceived richness and indulgence of the product.

**Natural Vanilla and Chocolate Infusion:**

Ryan's Irish Cream stands out by utilizing natural vanilla and chocolate infusions to enhance its flavor profile. These infusions are carefully measured to provide a balanced sweetness and depth, avoiding the overly artificial taste sometimes found in similar products.

The inclusion of a proprietary spice blend adds a layer of complexity and warmth to Ryan's Irish Cream.While the exact composition remains a trade secret, hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, and other aromatic spices are discernible, creating a comforting and inviting aroma and flavor. This blend is critical to differentiating Ryan's from other similar products on the market.

Ryan's Irish cream strikes a careful balance in its sweetness level. Too much sugar overwhelms the other flavors, while too little leaves the liqueur lacking in the desired indulgence. Ryan's aims for the ""Goldilocks"" zone, providing sufficient sweetness while allowing the whiskey, cream, and spice notes to shine through.

1m1s61v,https://www.reddit.com/r/summariseme/comments/1m1s61v/20250716_health_headlines_breakthroughs_risks/,"(2025-07-16) Health Headlines Breakthroughs, Risks Your Wellness","Here‚Äôs a comprehensive synthesis of the health news from the specified period, integrating the provided summaries:

**Health News Roundup: July 16, 2025**

The health landscape on July 16, 2025, presented a mixed bag of concerns, from food safety and lifestyle choices to the dangers of online misinformation and the fallout from doping scandals. A common thread ran through many of these stories: the critical need for informed decision-making and a cautious approach to both consumption and health practices.

**Food Safety and Consumer Awareness:**

One of the most pressing issues highlighted in the news was the erosion of food safety standards in Pune. Sweet shops in the city have largely abandoned the display of essential information like manufacturing dates, best-before dates, and prices on their products. This move followed a shift in regulations by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), making date labeling voluntary for loose sweets. This rollback from a 2020 mandate has raised significant health concerns, leaving consumers without the means to assess the freshness and quality of their purchases. The situation is further underscored by a recent incident at Pune‚Äôs Good Luck Cafe, where a temporary license suspension was issued due to hygiene issues, including the detection of a glass piece in a bun maska. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential health risks associated with a lack of transparency in food handling and labeling.

**The Hidden Dangers of Plastic Exposure:**

The detrimental effects of plastic exposure continued to dominate health discussions. Dr. Saiprasad Girish Lad, a consultant gastroenterologist, hepatologist, and therapeutic GI endoscopist at Wockhardt Hospitals in Mumbai, emphasized the importance of avoiding plastic in all forms. Driven by the growing awareness of microplastics and their impact on gut health, Dr. Lad revealed the five common sources of plastic he actively avoids, emphasizing that his concerns are rooted in scientific evidence rather than trends. Notably, one area of concern highlighted was plastic water bottles, particularly those exposed to heat, such as in parked cars. These conditions can facilitate the release of microplastics and harmful chemicals like BPA, underscoring the need for safe alternatives.

**Lifestyle Choices and Shared Habits Impacting Health:**

Lifestyle choices and the impact of shared habits on health were also prominent. An Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR)-led study revealed a worrying trend: the increasing prevalence of obesity among married couples in India. The study found that shared routines, food choices, and sedentary habits often contribute to weight gain. The case of Sulabha and Jatin Deshpande, a Mumbai-based couple, provided a tangible example. Despite starting their marriage with different preferences, the demands of a busy life led them to adopt similar habits, including convenient, processed food options, and a decline in physical activity. This convergence of lifestyle factors ultimately impacted their physical health. The study underscores how easily couples can unintentionally influence each other‚Äôs health outcomes, highlighting the importance of conscious decision-making and open communication regarding health goals within relationships.

**The Perils of Online Health Information:**

The dangers of misinformation on the internet were also in focus, particularly regarding unproven health remedies. A trend involving coffee enemas, touted by some as a ""natural detox"" and a cure-all, garnered negative attention from health professionals. Medical experts warned against this practice, highlighting the potential for severe adverse effects. Dr. Idrees Mughal, a digital creator, cautioned against the practice. This underscores the importance of critically evaluating health information online and consulting qualified healthcare professionals before adopting unconventional treatments.

**Doping in Sports:**

Finally, the news cycle included a significant development in the world of sports, with the repercussions of doping cases coming to the fore. British tennis player Tara Moore was handed a four-year suspension by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). This decision overturned her earlier clearance in a doping case. Moore tested positive for the banned anabolic steroids nandrolone and boldenone in June 2022. While she initially claimed contamination through meat consumption, CAS ruled that she had not provided sufficient evidence to support this claim. The ruling serves as a reminder of the ethical responsibilities of athletes and the severe consequences of violating anti-doping regulations.

**Conclusion:**

The health news from this period painted a complex picture. While advancements continue to be made in healthcare, a number of health risks were exposed. It reiterated the necessity for vigilance, consumer awareness, and critical thinking when it comes to health-related decisions. The need for transparency in food production, responsible plastic use, mindful lifestyle choices, and a healthy dose of skepticism towards online health claims are all important takeaways. In essence, the news highlighted the importance of taking a proactive and informed approach to personal health and well-being.

I'm in my grandfather's old room. I say old because he died a week ago, and I'm typing this post for all of you now. I know most of the posts on here, with good reason, are requesting advice, help, or just putting out a dire warning, but honestly, I just want to tell someone about all of this. It's freaky and traumatizing, but undeniably interesting.

My grandpa and I were close. Not as close as we should have been perhaps, but in this time where the regular church/family structure is slowly fading away, no opinion on that, it's definitely impressive that a teenager would voluntarily go visit his grandparents at least once a week in highschool and then as often as he could in college, substituting with check up calls. He had a big effect on my life, and I miss him dearly. Now I just wish I'd asked a lot more questions.

After days of funerals, lawyers, and all the like, my dad and I agreed that I could live at the old house if I started to work towards paying off some old debts. I'm not going to go into specifics, but it was the deal of a lifetime, really. I was going to own land and a paid-off home if I stayed current for the next few years.

Apparently, Dad has as much info as I did; he just assumed it was an old house with regular belongings and that my grandpa had leftover mortgage payments or something like that.

""Alright Wyatt, just sign here and I'll mail it. I'm not sure when his representative will come, but it shouldn't be too long.""

That's not my real name, and from here on out, just assume any name you read is fake, because it is. I've got enough trouble to deal with now, and I don't need to add stalking to that list.

""Why isn't it just his lawyer? He handled all the other estate stuff.""

""I don't know, I guess Dad wanted a separate guy for his business accounts or something. I'll call you later.""

With that, Dad left and dropped the form off in the mailbox. I forgot to mention that Grandpa owned an antique/pawn/swap meet store. It bought, sold, and exchanged all kinds of items, and it was really interesting to take a walk through. For now, my uncle is keeping an eye on it, but it's not open yet.¬†

I watched Dad walk down the fading brick walkway, stoop down, place the envelope in the box, and flick the flag up. He got in his car and drove off, but as I was still looking out the window, I saw the flag suddenly flick back down.

It was cloudy, sure, but all of a sudden the clouds became much thicker and greyer. The wind began to howl, and the lights in the house flickered. Down the road, where I had just seen Dad's tail lights disappear, I saw headlights.

It was clearly a very nice car. Matte black, tinted windows, and it just sounded expensive, but I don't even think it had a brand. Must have been custom or something, but I was sure I'd never seen anything like it, and I hope I never do again. It rolled down the street and came up the driveway. The left back seat flung open.¬†

Out stepped a tall, pale man in a very nice, but very loose, charcoal grey suit. His hairline was thinning, but still his hair was slicked back, and there was no facial hair on his gaunt face or under his bony nose. Everything about him was alien: the way he walked, the way his arms swayed, his unmoving neck, and his eyes. His cold, powerful eyes looked like they could see through a brick wall, and as they were hiding such a vast repository of knowledge, yet they still looked tired.¬†

I opened the door, as unnerving as he was, I didn't think he was dangerous, and he carried himself like someone who belonged there to do business. As he got closer, I barely saw the chain of a necklace almost concealed beneath his collar, and I finally took note of the classy leather briefcase he was holding.¬†

""Hello, Samuel, long time no see.""

He pronounced it SAM-WELL.

""That was my grandfather, and that wasn't how his name was pronounced.""

""Hmm?""

He set the case down on the porch table and opened it for a moment to pull a paper out. Looking at it, I realized it was the paper I just signed, and that surely must still be in the mailbox.¬†

""Oh!""

His voice was a mock surprise, but I could tell he enjoyed what he had just read. He reached his arm out to me.¬†

""Hello Wyatt, sorry for the confusion, my name is John, but you can call me Mr. Cavae.""

Those were the real names he told me, but something tells me they were fake to begin with. I shook his hand, which had a surprisingly firm grip for such cold, bony fingers.

""It's no problem.""

""May I come in?""

""Yeah sure, I assume you knew Grandpa?""

""Yes, I was a representative for him.""

""Representative for what?""

He ignored me and sat down at the table. After he entered, the lights flickered once more, and I was sure I heard a short, earthy hum, similar to what might emanate out of a crystal, from somewhere.

""Okay, do you have a driver's license or some other form of identification?""

""What?""

""I need to verify you.""

""For what?""

Then he even looked confused for a second.

""Oh. Sorry, sir, I didn't realize Samuel hadn't told you so much.""

I sat down and he went over the paper I had just signed stating I wished to take over my grandfather's role as curator of the house, which seemed an odd name because it wasn't a museum or something like that, and then Mr Cavae went over a very long contract.¬†

Many details aren't important, and really were just bland legal jargon, but the main gist of it all was that Mr. Cavae and his associates were grandpa's main ""creditors."" He explained that he had fallen behind on some of his work, but he was still an important and valuable client, so they allowed him some grace. If I proved myself in clearing his debts, then the claim they had to the house and its assets would be resolved, and I could possibly see some of the same benefits that my grandfather had, though he didn't explain further with the indication that this would be some time away. After that, he went back to business, checking my driver's license, confirming the last four digits of my social, and going over a credit report on me. Despite all of this information being in his briefcase, it was clear he hadn't even glanced at it yet. He signed off on a lot of things and wrote down some notes here and there, but finally, he only asked me for one signature. I held my hand out for his pen. He smiled grimly.

""Oh no, sir, we're very traditional.""

He reached up to the top of his briefcase, and I heard the loosening of a buckle. He presented an ornate and beautiful fountain pen. It had a thick granite cap, and the rest of it was made from silver, and centered on the handle was a dark black jewel. I thought it might have been an onyx stone or obsidian or something, but I wasn't sure, and I'm certainly not sure now.

I should have looked over everything again, and I should have asked more questions, especially about what the debts even were, but I wanted that house, and I still do. If I had to go back now, I think I still would have signed it, but yeah, I would have asked a lot more questions.

He took off the cap and circled where I was to sign. I didn't argue, and I think I was a bit starstruck by the pen itself, and I signed. I remember carefully gliding the pen along the line, being satisfied that my signature actually looked official, and lifting my hand up to realize the jewel on the pen had become red. I felt faint.¬†

Mr. Cavae stood up and shook my limp hand. He placed a worn envelope on the table and made his exit.¬†

""Well, Wyatt, I'm very pleased to have met you, and I look forward to doing business with you for the foreseeable future. Good luck.""

After he left, I got up to get a drink of water and eat something to get my head right. I made my way out to the mailbox, still recovering just a bit, and down the road I saw his headlights one last time. I looked in and there was nothing there. I'm not really surprised after everything else that happened, but still, it was hard to wrap my head around the form ""teleporting"" into his briefcase.

I opened up the envelope he had left, it smelled like onions, and inside was a receipt book. I tried to open it, but I could only get to the first page. It had a sticky note that said ""check the attic."" I pulled it off, and below was a log where my grandfather had rented a VHS tape from a local video store. I know, a bit of a lackluster turn from everything else that'd just happened, but yeah, it was a VHS rental that was 12 years past due. Again, I tried to go to another page, but I physically could not separate the pages. It's hard to explain, but there were definitely other pages; it wasn't just a piece of cardboard with one page attached to it or something like that. I felt the ridges of the pages and even¬†*some*¬†leeway, but I felt immense pushback when I tried to separate them. I tried one more time, with some more force, and the pages separated just a hair, but it began to let out this horrible electronic wailing sound, and I dropped it in surprise. I didn't try again after that.¬†

I made my way upstairs and rummaged around in closets for 20 minutes until I found the attic key (a really long Allen wrench), and then I had to recover myself again after the attic latch released moldy dust onto me and my open eyes.

Above, I was immediately taken aback by how large the attic was. Do you know that scene in Harry Potter where they're in the Room of Requirements or whatever and there's all that mystical junk lying around? It was a lot like that, except on a smaller scale, and a lot of it was stuffed into cardboard boxes.¬†

I saw tribal relics, old technology, stuffed animals, and lots of old clothes. I mean, like a metric ton of old clothes, Grandpa had no reason to hold onto them. Grandma had passed years ago, but they weren't even women's clothes. I admit this is not important, but still, there is a ridiculous number of clothes up there.

Anyways, near the entrance was a machine that resembled an ATM. I walked up to it, blew off the dust, coughed for a few minutes, and powered it on. It flashed my grandpa's name for a second, but then it must've updated suddenly, and it read my name out. All it gave me was a simple welcome before it requested the receipt book to be validated. A slot at my waist level suddenly clicked open, and I slowly inserted the book inside. After some digital humming, I heard a hard CHUNK, and it spat the book back out at me as it printed a small receipt. Ripping it off, I read it to see that it was directions for getting through the mess behind me to the right box. Box number 268. It had a line for directions underneath this information, and it said I needed to retrieve the tape and return for further instructions.

I was quickly aware that I wasn't alone up there. I heard quick, but heavy shuffling. Something would be knocked over, but when I turned to look at the disturbance, there was nothing there to have caused it. And, in general, I felt the uncomfortable feeling of being watched. Of course, at the time, I only had reason to believe the worst-case scenario was a rabid raccoon I would have to wrestle with, and so I trudged on following the specific directions laid out for me. Right at the multicolor rack of clothes, continue forward at the divers helmet, when you hear an analog version of Beethoven's 5th up ahead, turn left immediately and don't say a word (this part was in bold), and finally throw the faux bear skin rug off and there's the box. 268 was spelled out in Sharpie. It was a box of VHS tapes.¬†

I hadn't heard any noises in quite a while, so I made myself comfortable and started sifting through and stacking the tapes in front of me. It was nice, rummaging through old memories and absorbing little pockets of nostalgia here and there. I found a VHS copy of Rom and Kerry, season two of Little Maestro, and even a tape of Galactic Assault. Some young favorites of mine. I also found some porno tapes. I opted to throw those into a nearby box of old socks, except for one titled Spicy 17th Anniversary, which was home filmed. I scratched out the name and snapped that one, partly a favor to grandpa, and to myself. I tossed the remains and kept sorting. I actually found some other cool VHS tapes I didn't even know he had. There was a copy of The Matter, a cult classic horror movie, a director's cut of Baron of the Deep, a popular Atlantis fantasy movie, and even a tape that said it had news recordings of the Watergate scandal and of Nixon leaving office. There was also another porn tape I threw away.

However, at the very bottom of the box, there was a final tape that had a rental receipt rubber-banded to it. I picked it up, but there was no name on it. Upon further inspection, I saw that the plastic casing of the VHS had many small intricate carvings all over it. I thought it seemed really cool, and at the time, I assumed it must have been a limited edition version of some cult or voodoo magic-themed horror movie. It sends a shiver down my spine, and I am forced to shake myself when I recall that I planned to watch the tape before I returned, but since I wasn't about to root around that attic for a VHS player, I decided to just head straight to the store.¬†

The directions on the receipt said to simply reverse the earlier directions and trail my way back to the entrance. Once again, I followed them to a tee, this time carrying the box with me, but when I heard the analog track of Beethoven's 5th, it stopped for a moment, and I heard a robotic voice call out to me:

""***Hello?****""*

I rushed away after hearing that, and the music returned, but it was sped up and much louder. I just barely heard it echoing when I reached the entrance and rushed back down the stairs. I shut the latch, but as soon as I did, I heard scratching noises coming from it.

I knew where the rental store was. I guess we once had a few in town; we may even have had a Blockbuster at some point, but they had slowly died off, and now there was just one left. An old high school friend of mine works there now as the cashier. He sells weed out of it, but the owner doesn't mind because, as Gregg tells me, the owner's just laundering money with it for a local crime ring. And so, the store stays open despite, you know, being far past the worldwide adoption of DVDs and Gregg selling his wares in full view of the security camera. The only customers to come into the store are a group of hoodie-clad young men ""returning a rental"" and Mr. Rimmer, who keeps renting the same copy of Love on the Tides every single week. Gregg tried to just sell him the copy a few times, but he quickly understood that Mr. Rimmer was just lonely and enjoyed Gregg's stoned company.

I parked in the cracking thrall of faded asphalt. The Tallmart next door was busy, and upon entering the store, I saw that Gregg had made himself a lunch of Tallmart brand deli items. I'll be honest, I've done it too. Pretty cheap lunch for some good food, maybe give it a shot. Anyways, I laid the VHS on the counter, and even Gregg was quickly confused by it, and then annoyed.

""Bro, why are you bringing me this shit? It's¬†*twelve years*¬†past due.""

""Look, it was first up on working through Grandpa's stuff.""

""Dude, I think management has changed twice since this was rented. Just keep it.""

I guess the owner saw that someone other than Mr. Rimmer was actually bringing a VHS in and, out of curiosity, came down to see what was up.¬†

""Gregg, something wrong?""

""Wyatt's grandpa died, and he's trying to return a VHS for him.""

The owner smelled like sweat and cigarettes. Apparently, you don't get used to it because I saw Gregg turn his nose up a bit as well.¬†

""You brought in a twelve-year past-due tape?""

""Is there a fee or something?""

He just gave me a deadpan, disappointed look. I guess it was a bit dumb, but seeing it on the receipt book, I just assumed it was supposed to finally be returned, after all, a rental would definitely be considered a debt. The owner turned it over a couple more times, scrutinizing it.

""What movie even is this?""

""I don't know. I assumed, based on the symbols, that it was some kind of culty horror movie.""

""Yeah, maybe. Let's go look.""¬†

Gregg turned the front sign to closed and we made our way into the backroom. There, Gregg pulled the record book, and we tried sifting through it to find this tape. We found it, with its line all blacked out.

""Huh.""

Apparently, this was new to the owner as well.

""Alright, well let's just play it to see what's on it. Gregg, you think you could take the trash out while I get the VHS player hooked up, also, you.""

He passively flicked his hand at me.

""Could you get the receipt? We left it on the counter, and I want to look at it again.""

We both got up from the decrepit and lumpy couch and did as we were requested. I followed Gregg out back and was thoroughly surprised that his lone pot head frame could swing the heavy bag of trash back and forth and then land it perfectly into the next door Chinese buffet's dumpster, with a sign that said ""RESTAURANT TRASH ONLY."" We walked back inside and stood at the counter, talking about the house and about Gregg's side hustle, but we soon heard something from the backroom. It sounded like screaming.

We ran back behind the counter and threw open the door. Entering the backroom, to the immediate left is a wall, and the rest of the room is to the right. The television was facing the back of the room, and it was one of the large cube-shaped ones, so we couldn't see what was on the screen. What I thought were the owner's screams were actually emanating from the TV. There must've been thousands of voices wailing, laughing, crying, and chanting dark, indecipherable messages. Wind was rushing around the room, being sucked like a vacuum into the screen and against the back wall there were odd shadows being cast by bright sickly light. It was as though the screen itself were gone, and a portal had opened up, with figures collecting just beyond the veil. The owner was standing there, clothes flapping and arms lying limp at his sides. His mouth was agape, and his eyes were struck open.

*""It's so beautiful. Oh God.""*

Suddenly he began howling, and before us his skin began to melt off his body, and was sucked through. Quickly, his whole body, blood, organs, bones, and all separated themselves from him, and he was gone. All that was left was the food in his bowels, it looked like McDonald's, and an artificial hip. A sound, like lightning being torn in half, screamed across us, and the light closed off as the portal closed. The player spit the tape out.¬†

There was such an awful silence after that. Gregg and I just stared at the spot, obviously in shock. I mean, how else were we supposed to react? Finally, I began to move back into the room, and Gregg inched forward with me. I rounded the corner and found that neither the TV nor the VHS player showed any signs of being involved in the inexplicable horror that had just unfolded. I turned over and found the tape lying sideways behind the coffee table. I hovered my hand over it for a second, and I even dropped an old fry from the floor on it first. No effect, after I lightly tapped it with the back of my arm, I picked it up. Gregg and I stared down at it. The symbols on the sides had turned bright red.

""What do we do?""

Hearing another person's voice after all that and all the silence shook me for a moment. I thought for a second, but the thoughts just wouldn't form. What could the police do? What could anyone do? It certainly didn't seem like he was going to be in any savable state. Even before his body had disintegrated, that tape had affected his mind. The only thing that could have possibly been done for him was to watch the tape ourselves and try to figure it out, or I guess to go in after him. And we sure as hell weren't doing that. I didn't even know the guy and Gregg had always said he was kind of a dick.

Gregg walked over, picked up the replacement hip, and turned back to me.¬†

""Listen, I'm gonna throw this away, and then I'm gonna clear the security footage. If anyone asks, let's just say he skipped town.""

I didn't really have any other ideas, so I nodded. After I finally got my legs moving again, I quickly walked out the door and sped all the way back to the house. As I sat in the kitchen, eyes wide open, trying to ignore the sound of distant scratching, I went over everything in my head over again. I felt like a character in a horror game who finally realizes they are in a supernatural, deadly situation, and that things are far beyond their knowledge and control. I realized I hadn't locked my car door, and I stuffed my hand into my pocket to retrieve my keys, but as I did so, my hand ran over crumpled paper. I pulled the slip out with my keys, pressed the button to lock my door, and then looked over it. It was the receipt that the machine in the attic had returned to me. A worried feeling suddenly washed over me when I reread the line:

""Retrieve the unmarked tape, and return for further instructions.""

I got up and made my way upstairs. It took a while to get myself to do it, but after I smacked the door with the latch key a couple of times and the scratching stopped, I opened it up and slowly climbed upstairs. Poking my head through, I really felt like I was in a horror game.

There wasn't anything waiting to rip me in half on the other side, thankfully, but I still didn't feel good up there. The 5th was still playing in the distance. I walked back over to the machine, which somehow had another layer of dust. I blew it off, and as I stood there coughing once more, I made a note to start donning a face mask and arming myself with a can of keyboard cleaner.

My heart sank as I pressed a button to bring the machine back to life. It said, clearly, ""DO NOT PLAY THE TAPE. Deposit tape here and then store it.""¬†

I did as I was instructed, and the machine began to whirr for a while. As I waited, I noticed that the attic layout had clearly changed. I don't mean something got knocked over; I mean everything was moved around. Even the egregious amount of old clothes seemingly walked around on their own and ended up planting themselves in places that seemed semi-organized. Finally, I heard another deep chunk and turned back around to find the tape waiting for retrieval. It was no longer glowing on the sides.

I felt tired, and I still do. I just put the tape down beside the machine and covered it with a shirt. I headed back downstairs and locked the latch again, but I jumped as I heard something slam into it, followed by more scratching.

That was yesterday. I remember lying around the house for the rest of the day with all the lights off. It was surprisingly easy to brush off the manager's death. After all, he was aiding a local crime ring in selling drugs, and not like pot, I mean, the life-ruining ones. Also, Gregg told me he was kind of a dick. But, really, I was bothered by the situation I had found myself in. I was in a new world of unknowns, and I didn't know any of the rules, if there were rules at all. It's also just hard to relax with such an ominous space looming just above me, emanating those scratching sounds, all day long.¬†

What certainly didn't help was that I'd slowly begun to work my way through the fridge, and a fresh batch of bills had piled in through the mail, but, much to my surprise, when I came out to check the mail this morning, I found another envelope. It was cream colored, and the textured paper was very pleasant to touch. When I opened it, I found a check, one from Mr. Cavae, to me, and with enough money on it to clear all my worries about bills and groceries. There was a note.¬†

""Good job on your first order, Wyatt. For this first order, we're giving you the whole check, but from here on out 30% goes back to us. Keep this up, and you'll have plenty more deposits to look forward to as you clear your debts.""

I wondered for a moment why someone as powerful as him, or whatever he was representing, would have any need for Earthly cash, but I just decided to take my money and shut up. I was also grateful that I wasn't going to be punished for my mistake.

And now, here I am. I've paid all the bills and bought all the fridge essentials: eggs, pizza rolls, almond milk, and beer. The scratching has quieted down a bit, but it's still there. I catch myself wondering if I should try to find some way out of this, to end my ""relationship"" with Cavae and all this madness, but something tells me that's not an option anymore. I think after I post this, I'll check on the next order. Maybe keep a look out in case I'm dumb enough to do another¬†[order](https://www.reddit.com/user/MDTStories/).

I just wanted to share something that‚Äôs been helping me feel better lately. in case anyone else out there is feeling stuck, bloated, or trying to lose a little weight but doesn't know where to start.

I‚Äôve been slowly trying to get healthier, not with anything extreme, just small habits that are easy to stick with. And one thing that‚Äôs actually made a difference for me is tea. Yep, regular herbal tea you can buy at the store.

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a magic fix. But drinking certain teas has helped me a lot with digestion, bloating, and even going to the bathroom more regularly (which i personally struggle w/ the most). Here are 5 I really like and what each one helps with:

# üçµ 1. Ginger Tea

Helps with: Bloating, gas, cramping, upset stomach

This one is amazing if your stomach often feels tight, bloated, or full of gas. Ginger warms up your belly and helps your body break down food better. I like drinking it after dinner. it makes my stomach feel calm and way less puffy.

It also helps a lot if you get cramps (period cramps too) or feel a little nauseous. Simple, soothing, and super effective.

# üçµ 2. Barberry Tea

Helps with: Digestion, sugar cravings, and skin

This one‚Äôs a little more rare, but it‚Äôs worth it. It helps your body process food better and might even reduce how much you crave sweets.

I also noticed it helps with my skin when I drink it more often. it feels like it helps clean things out from the inside. It‚Äôs a little sour tasting, but in a good way! I usually drink it after a heavy meal.

# üçµ 3. Lemon Tea (or lemon water)

Helps with: Bloating, feeling heavy, hydration

This is the easiest one to start with ‚Äî just hot water and lemon, or a lemon-flavored herbal tea. I drink it in the morning before eating anything, and it always helps me feel lighter and more awake.

Lemon tea gets things moving in your stomach (if you know what I mean üí©) and can help your body let go of all the stuff it doesn‚Äôt need. It‚Äôs also great for your skin and hydration.

# üçµ 4. Green Tea

Helps with: Energy, metabolism, and belly fat

Green tea is popular for a reason, it gives you a little natural energy (but not too much), and it‚Äôs known to help with burning fat, especially around your belly.

I usually drink it mid-morning or before a workout or walk. It also helps me feel more focused and less tired without needing coffee. Plus, it‚Äôs full of healthy stuff that‚Äôs good for your body.

# üçµ 5. Hyleys Cranberry Slim Tea (i swear by this one)

Helps with: Bloating, bathroom issues, feeling ""stuck"", water weight

This one is a total go-to for me ‚Äî especially on days when I feel super bloated or like I haven‚Äôt gone to the bathroom in a while. It‚Äôs a cranberry-flavored tea that gently helps your body let go of extra waste and water.

It‚Äôs made with natural ingredients like senna (which helps with digestion), cranberry (for water retention), and green tea (for metabolism). I only use it a couple times a week ‚Äî not every day ‚Äî but when I need a little boost, it really does help me feel lighter and less backed up.

üëâ I use [this one here](https://amzn.to/44ie6TC) and it works great for me. Just putting it out there in case anyone else has been dealing with the same struggles.

 Reminder: All of these teas help with **gut health** in some way. and a happy gut plays a HUGE role in fat loss, energy, and mood. When your digestion is on point, your whole body runs better.

If you're struggling with bloating, irregular bathroom habits, or slow metabolism ‚Äî give one of these teas a try. You don‚Äôt need to overhaul your life overnight. Just start with a warm mug a day and build from there üíõ

You‚Äôre not alone. Progress looks different for everyone, and little habits **DO** add up over time. Keep going. You‚Äôve got this. üåü

Let me know if you‚Äôve tried any of these or if there are others I should check out!

Sanity shatters. And all that‚Äôs left is the neurons finally making the connection. Did you know I had once suffered a compound fracture in my right arm? Why would you? Except there was a moment just then, the ever-thin slice of time, between the moment you didn‚Äôt know and the moment you knew that factoid.

I had just turned 25. A few days after my birthday was when it began. My coworker at my new job had been telling me about a recent NASA finding with the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope. I felt it after she had been carrying on and on about how galaxies never seen before had been mapped, evidence of water on distant exoplanets had been found, and the light from the very beginnings of the universe could now be seen. Every single fact that she laid into my ears drew out to an inexplainable span of time; an eternity in a single moment, and I felt them there, between the gaps of knowledge. I saw them trapezing and galloping and dancing in a kaleidoscopic, chaotic fashion that scintillated with the vivid colors of some cosmic dream. I shivered, my eyes wide, my jaw gone slack.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù my coworker broke my trance. ‚ÄúAre you even listening?‚Äù

I shook myself from my stupor and politely told her that I had to get back to my desk and take care of something. I returned to my cubicle and tried to carry on with the more menial tasks that peppered my day. I chalked what I had seen up to some fever dream born from boredom. I started in on my excel sheet, crunching numbers left and right, but the vision I had seen lingered ever so slight around the corners of my mind. My hand was shaking as I finished my first task, and I knew I could not go another second without seeing them.

I tried to recall how exactly those specters in my mind had been conjured. My hand clicked the mouse button over the web browser on my desktop, and I typed in the search bar, ‚ÄúJames Webb Space Telescope discoveries,‚Äù after coming to the natural conclusion. And as I read article, after article, after article, those mesmerizing visions began to play like a movie in the back of my mind.

‚ÄúAllen. What‚Äôre you doing?‚Äù my manager asked right into my ear. I jumped out of my skin and fumbled to close the web browser. I hadn‚Äôt felt him creep up on me, getting so close his lips were almost touching my ear.

‚ÄúYou creep!‚Äù I shouted at the top of my lungs. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever touch me again!‚Äù I turned to him and stood up. My manager backed away, trying to protest but I didn‚Äôt let up.

‚ÄúTrying kiss my ear huh? Trying to cop a feel on the new guy?‚Äù I snapped. I knew it was a cheap shot, but I had to play it. If he reported me for what I was actually doing, I could lose my job. At that he flushed red, giving me a wide-eyed look before briskly walking back to his office, closing the door. Just to play it up further, I grabbed my things and stormed out of the office, exclaiming that we worked for a scumbag.

When I returned home early my dad was awake.

‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôre back early. What gives? Did they fire you already?‚Äù He snickered. But I paid him no heed. I only grabbed my laptop, walked calmly into my bedroom, and sat on the bed with the computer. I laid it on my lap and began again those otherworldly visions. My father snapped me from my trance when I heard his words coming through the crack in the door.

‚ÄúAllen. Allen!‚Äù When he had my attention he asked, ‚ÄúIs everything alright? You didn‚Äôt actually get fired did you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I mumbled dumbly. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt feel well. I took sick time for the remainder of the day.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù my father trailed off, his eyes looking down. ‚ÄúWell, if you need anything let me know. Get better soon ok?‚Äù

I nodded. He shut the door softly and I resumed.

A week passed. I only left my room for basic needs. Work had tried calling, but I did not pick up. I had found that it wasn‚Äôt just knowledge about the James Webb Space Telescope that would generate those visions, but any knowledge I consumed. When I would put down my laptop to grab some food or go to the bathroom, I would begin to sweat and shake. Only when I hurriedly laid back down into bed, my eyes fixated on some article about insect mating habits or how many left and right turns one could make before leaving a city, did my symptoms abate.

As the weeks turned into months I ate less and less. I went to the bathroom, less and less. My eyes became sunken, bloodshot from never blinking. My cranium began to bulge. I no longer slept.

My father would periodically come to check in on me. At some point he stopped, probably when I would only hiss or growl at him in response to his questions. Why he never called a hospital, or the police still escapes me to this day, but I assume it‚Äôs because of shame. He didn‚Äôt want people to see me like that.

When my skull had become the size of a watermelon, I knew the time was near. The pulsing of my bulbous, swollen, distended skull marked the days that it would burst and give form to something new.

After nine months I had finally consumed the entirety of the knowledge contained on the internet. And as I read the last word that I would ever read in that horrid form, my skull having burst through the skin, the skin strewn about like tattered ribbons about its massive frame, everything faded to black.

I had become something different. I had become something more. And as I sit now in a coffee shop, writing this story, in my skinny jeans, off brand, sustainably sourced black v-neck shirt, with slicked back hair parted to the left, and tattoos saying common phrases in other languages littering my forearms, I push my glasses up to the bridge of my pierced nose. The couple next to me are discussing some trivial matters regarding politics. I turn to them, and say in my now nasally voice, ‚ÄúWell, actually‚Ä¶‚Äù",2,1752708252.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

Any one of those long stretching summer days that seem to go on until they're lost in the damp rot of autumn.

You do weird things after getting fired. I quickly got lost into my childhood routine, jogging by the local canal's waterside every day in the warm, silent twilight hour just before night.

The same 5 mile winding path burned into my memory. Number 19.

First came the long stone stretch, around a mile of worn-out pathway, jagged and rough rocks jutting out at every unfortunate opportunity.

To my left, a long wire fence, weathered boats scattered around the canal, dilapidated. One in every five or so would still have a little yellow light shining from the window, and smoke from it's whistle, it's owners entering the soft death spiral of retirement. To my right a new housing project was being built, the forgotten blackberry bushes murdered to make way for a haze of half-built buildings, cranes and slowly rotting heavy machinery.

Paved stone gave way to dispersed gravel. Buildings and machinery fleeing as quickly as they invaded, displaced by bushes of nettles, trees and what remains of the English wilds. A speck of nature in the lens of¬†**Industry**.

The gravel too soon stopped, and all that remained was a path of the variety poets and liars call less travelled by.

In reality, the council ran out of money and didn't bother with the rest.

Past the gravel, all of a sudden your sides are flanked by willows and oaks, branches on either side winding and weaving themselves into 8ft tall hallways. Rather than canal boats and metal fences, the canal lifts, the corners smudge. The roots of the trees poke out into the water. Just past the trees on the left, a sharp incline down into reeds and grass. Once in a while a foolhardy tree decided to be sowed into it's side, it's roots regretting the decision wholeheartedly as it quietly drowned into the canal.

It's there that the plastic caught my eye. It was sticking out of the mud, at the side of the bank. Unmistakable between the shit coloured water, shit caked mud, and shit covered grass.

**... --- ...**

Sorry. I'm still bitter. I miss you.

This place is pretty in it's own way I suppose. I was here half my childhood, so that thin foil smudged off a long time ago. I spent so much of my life here trying to escape it, I guess I never appreciated it's twisted form of prettiness.

There is beauty here; Lonely empty beauty, even in the town.

The shops are mostly closed down. The 'temporary' concrete from the 50s that constituted a high-street rotting away beneath layers of cracks, bakeries twisted into gambling bookies, the coffee shops and newsagents melted into rows of grotesque neon purple vape & american sweets shops.

**... --- ...**

I remember there was an artist we saw once in a museum. You were telling me about some ugly sculpture as we walked past. Do you remember?

You stopped me, asked why I wasn't listening. Said something snide about how I do it all the time. Scatter-brained.

But I remember the painting. Do you remember that painting?

It was this beautiful still life. Ripening fruit, and flowering buds. Perfect soft lights and shadows fell on each individual petal, it's creators obsessive attention shining through. You said you've seen a thousand of them before. You laughed at the right half of the canvas, a howler monkey on the table tearing his sharpened teeth against a ripening fruit, red juice staining his hungry face.

We kept walking. I didn't talk to you about it. I don't know why.

But below the ripe fruit bowl, and in the vase of flowering roses, it caught my eye.

In the same vibrant shades and hues, with the same gorgeous detail lay dead and rotting exotic birds.

The monkey wasn't biting into a fruit.

Still beautiful in a way; bright coats of amber and lilac, still and rotting, small dots of¬†**Flies**¬†circling carcasses. This town feels like that painting, that same cruel beauty.

The mixture of life, death and wilderness fighting for the same cruel space on the canvas.

**... --- ...**

There's no rolling hills to look out on, even when you get out of the town it's just fields of inedible rapeseed, lifeless canals in which no fish dare tread and dispersed bits of wood & nature clinging to life against the encroaching developments.

It's strange, but I used to feel a stranger within that nature, more so than the local town. Eastern Europe is filled with massive woods, all encompassing, places that you could lose yourself in. Filled with life and bird-song. Beautiful, stretching forests filled with a plethora of wildlife, rarely seen but ever present, a calming panopticon of life.

It's not like Britain has wild bears hiding in the trees. Snakes are few and far between, and mostly harmless. Any monster left in England long ago had put on a tie, shaved and started working as an estate agent (the final resting place of all evil).

Yet slowly, a dread comes over you when you approach a deeper section of wood here, one I haven't felt in any other country. It's this feeling in the back of your head that you can't escape, a question that noisessly forms towards the bare wood, clinging to wilderness against the denseness of development.

*Why are you still here?*

And sometimes, through the wind, the whistles and the straining of the branches - I sometimes used to think that I could hear a word uttered in the rustle of the leaves.

Interloper.

I don't remember what made me pick it up or walk through the swarms of summer Flies, squelching in the soft dirt of the canal, it was half buried in the silty mud, it's casing caked with soil and dirt.

I don't particularly love old tat, but there was something so nostalgic about seeing that object, a memory from another world.

Submerged in that dirt was a Nokia 3310.

I had one in school. My parents struggled to afford anything more expensive, but I cherished that gift like it was pure gold. Even as the other kids started to get the first iPhone, I held onto it for dear life, you couldn't do much apart from play snake and text, but those Nokias were indestructible.

Apart from being covered in a layer of silt and dirt, it looked... It was like it had come from the Factory brand new, no scratches, buttons all there. After wiping it clean with a nearby leaf, It looked like it did two decades ago. I took it into my hands then, climbing back up the side of the canal.

I've been running on that path every single evening, I never put much thought into it, just jogged.

The bird song, the crickets, the buzzing of summer Flies, the buzzing of summer Flies. The wind rustling through the leaves.

All noise I've become used to.

But as soon as I got back up that path, back in the gentle nature of that path - it stopped.

All sound ceased.

It was instant. Like pausing an orchestra in the middle of a chord. My ears filled with silence, the woods themselves hushed and muted. I can't explain it, but there's a sort of terrible dread that comes through, starts through your heart and infects itself, rushing to your bones, then your head. The air suddenly felt different, hollow. It was the second before thunder, the cloying, clinging static permeating breath with empty air.

It's primal. My bones filled with the fear of silence. I looked towards the wood.

Darkness enveloped the arches of the trees, the branches jutted out and formed indescribable shapes in the darkness, mixing with the shadows to form terrible still creations on the ground ahead of me.

The twilight was creeping away, the only illumination a tiny slither of moonlight from the cloud cover, turning the horrid shadows into disgusting geometric puppets, contorting and moving like swarms, united by the direction of the light.

That's what made me see it. That's what made my heart fill with dread. What gave my brain that deep, reactive fear, the leopard in the deep grass.

The moon was behind me. No other lights illuminated the patch of wood.

So why, in that twilight hour, why were those beasts in the shadows of the branches; moving towards me?

I turned and ran.

I didn't dare look back, the eyes of the woods felt like Schrodinger's parable, death to the observer, fear and hatred was behind me and the lights of the houses my only clinging reality. Each branch felt like it was coiling it's way round my body, the bushes of nettles felt like they lunged at me as I ran, my arms stung with it's sparking shocks.

Something caused me to trip.

The rough gravel of the path burning my palm with it's sharp skin. The noises came back like lightning, a roaring, breaking wind within my ears as I grasped, my knees shaved and bleeding, my hands stinging, tiny shards of gravel lodged within my palm, mixing with the nettles poison to create an almost calming, numbing pain. I barely got up as I ran again, the lights of houses & canal boats ahead ever more distant.

I was screaming from the pain and the wind, my mind filled with nothing but the sense to run. I felt like a child, turning off the light and rushing into my bed, unknown horror right behind me, grasping at my shoulder, ready to pull me into the silent darkness.

I saw a figure then, in front of me, emerging from a winding path. Tall and.. reflective, bright yellow and torchlight within my blurry eyes. I heard a bark. I saw the tug of a leash.

It was a dogwalker.

He looked at me, bewildered. ""You okay lad?"" A rough, familiar English tone. I protected my eyes from his torch light until I was adjusted to the soft yellow hues. He placed it down.

He was maybe 50/60 years of age? People age quick in this town. His back slightly hunched, his face slightly saggy yet kind, he had a roundness of the frame that was clear over his bright his-vis jacket, cheap and scratched.

He was one of those elderly local men who would've looked suited within any generation. Any time. His walking stick rapped gently against the gravel as his dog, a small yapping creature of undisclosed background bobbed around him in circles, jitty and barking.

He was smiling when he saw me, a polite, automatic smile. There was no menace, no monster behind him. I looked at him, then looked behind me. My normal path. The normal woods, the bushes unkept but stationary.

I spoke. I tried to explain.

I forgot about my accent. I've been in England for so long, I've absorbed the language, but my accent won't die, no matter the coaching, the lessons, no matter how hard I try.

His smile dropped, just slightly. He shifted his weight onto his back foot defensively. I remember how his entire demeanour changed. How his eyes shifted, his nose sneering. His voice became rough, slow, as if talking to a child. The kindness of his face became a kind of sneering judgment.

""Best you get home mate."" he spoke with a slight venom behind his tongue. His torch shifted back on me, I could feel it inspecting my knees, my arms. He tutted. I began to turn, looking behind me, trying to find a sign of the doom I had felt moments ago.

His voice stopped me, became loud and grating.

""You people, it's bad enough you're taking the work from our good local lads, but you take god knows what and bother us here now too? Best you be getting home, don't want to get lost round these parts. ""

I'd usually speak out, insult him, tell him to fuck off. It felt like he was spewing out words he'd been preparing for years. Yet I couldn't help but smile slightly, stifling back a laugh.

I was almost happy to see him. Happy to feel prejudice rather than terror.

I muttered a sorry and walked back home. He gave another tut, then his face contorted further, his eyes unknowable in the deep darkness. ""This place is old. It doesn't take well to interlopers."" he shoed me away.

I was back at the fencing and housing soon. I looked back every few minutes, trying to see any sign of what caused that initial terror.

I only saw him. And he was watching me.

I swear every time I turned around he'd be staring. I couldn't help but notice that his dog was still, staring intently towards the woods.

When I made it inside, past the pain of the nettles and the gravel, I reached into my pocket for the Nokia. It stung against my bleeding hand, but it made me feel sane. As If I hadn't imagined what had happened to me.

As I washed my hands, carefully picking out each piece of stinging gravel, the phone began to turn on. I hadn't noticed until the familiar nokia tone rang through the bathroom. I almost jumped when the familiar, loud and shrill beeping notification came through.

The short answer is: K-Cups are designed for single use, but there are some clever workarounds.

When I first got my Keurig coffee maker (you can check out the latest models here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers), I tried reusing the same K-Cup twice to save money. The second cup was always weak and watery. This happens because the hot water has already stripped most of the coffee flavor during the first brew.

But here's what I discovered - while you can't reuse regular K-Cups effectively, there are reusable K-Cup filters available. These are fantastic alternatives that let you use your own ground coffee. I've been using one for over a year now, and it's saved me a lot of money.

The reusable filters work with most Keurig brewers and are pretty simple to use. Just fill them with your favorite ground coffee, pop them in like a regular K-Cup, and brew. When you're done, rinse it out, and it's ready for the next use.

Some benefits I've found using reusable filters:
- Save money on coffee
- Less plastic waste
- Freedom to use any coffee brand
- Better for the environment
- More control over coffee strength

Speaking of Keurig machines, if you're in the market for a new one, I highly recommend checking out the current deals here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers. I recently upgraded mine and the newer models have some great features.

One thing to keep in mind - if you decide to use reusable filters, make sure to grind your coffee to the right consistency. Too fine, and it might clog the filter; too coarse, and you'll get weak coffee. I've found that a medium grind works best.

As for regular K-Cups, they're really designed to be single-use only. The internal filter and coffee grounds are precisely measured for one perfect cup. Trying to reuse them just leads to disappointment and bad coffee.

Bottom line: Don't try to reuse disposable K-Cups. Instead, invest in a reusable filter or two. They're better for your wallet and the environment, plus you get more control over your coffee experience. It's really the best of both worlds - the convenience of a Keurig with the flexibility of using any coffee you want.",1,1752707996.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

Apparently there's this Ethiopian legend about a goatherd named Kaldi who basically discovered coffee by accident. Picture this: dude's just chilling with his goats in the highlands when he notices them going absolutely crazy after eating these bright red berries. Like, bouncing around with way more energy than usual.

Being curious (and probably a little concerned about his hyperactive goats), Kaldi tries the berries himself and BAM - instant energy boost. He takes them to the local imam who either brews them into a drink or accidentally drops them in a fire and gets hit with that amazing roasted coffee aroma we all know and love.

What really got me though is that this isn't just some random fairy tale. There's actual archaeological evidence backing up Ethiopia as coffee's birthplace - they've found charred coffee beans in ancient sites and there are references to coffee in 11th century medical texts!

The coolest part? The Oromo tribe in southern Ethiopia had all these different ways of using coffee way before it became mainstream:

* They made tea from roasted coffee leaves
* Mixed dried coffee berry skins with milk
* Even made these coffee bean + butter snacks for long journeys (honestly sounds pretty good?)

It's wild to think that every cup of coffee we drink today traces back to some goat herder in Ethiopia who was just trying to figure out why his animals were tweaking out on berries.

Coffee didn't stay in Ethiopia though - by the 1400s it had spread to Yemen, then Europe by the 1600s where coffee houses became these intellectual hubs they called ""penny universities.""

( It happened a week after I noted that I was going to become a father, but that's another aspect).

The reason I was hired was to dig deeper into company issues, finding the root cause.
My manager was thrilled to have an actual FBA on board. 

Queue her assistant-manager.
Since I needed to learn the ins and outs, she got me into spending 70% of my time into useless tracking that she needed for her glorious monthly pivot tables.
The thing is, that noting down of post-its, mails and several other influx into a spreadsheet got me some very much needed insight. Either (for example) the printers were moved every month from one site to the other, or there was a huge flaw.
Some if those flaws would be considered huge flags for the (equivalent of ) IRS.
When I started tracking them, as my job was exactly that, the A-M tried to block me from several internal data .

Since the manager and her assistant were pretty close, I tried to get the actual department from said flaws in the loop.
Less than a week later, the manager asked why I was 'snooping around' other departments. 
Meanwhile, everyone I spoke to at other departments were more than helpful in gathering information, even speaking to counterparts at other sites.

2 days later, she notified me she asked IT for a full copy of my mailbox (against the law) and was not amused.
Henceforth, I had to include her in every mail I send and had to write down by the minute on every casefile I was working on.

The last one was the easiest malicious compliance. When I got a call, I noted it, when I went to get a coffee I noted 'internal movement's, even someone sticking his head inside the door to say hi.
She got an excel sheet with about 600 lines a day, including a line after each entry for filling out the sheet.
After 3 days she was furious and 'wasnt taking things serious'. If course I wasn't, but she didn't have to know.
I asked her to email me on the specifics she wanted me to write down and asked for a route path on every project.
With a 'you know what I want', she stormed off.

I got an email from HR for a talk.
Told them everything, including my notes on every meeting.
They asked me to just set up a spreadsheet with a total per day on every project and mailed it to the manager. Including the note that I needed the information her assistant had blocked me from.

The including in the email part was fairly simple. It was about 10% of my total conversations.

When the manager went on vacation, she said she liked the new way of working and told me to push on 3 main issues I layed out.

And of course the assistant took her chance to get into the high chair. The mails were not adequate, so I had to send her a full report on any conversation.
It started innocent, till I got to an old file with the signature of the assistant and several sitemanagers. I started calling them and asked about the information listed.
After about 5 phonecalls and a small note mailed to the assistant, she stormed into the shared office calling me a no-good golden retriever trying to find truffels in muck water. She demanded a full report on any coming call.

I started using voice-to-text software to make full transcripts on any call. 
Even a question about something like 'how is the now cleaning lady doing' was fully written down.
Imagine receiving an average of four hours a day of transcription.
Because of the flooding, she missed the pattern about the million euro issue I was gently going towards.

When the manager came back, the assistant told her I was harassing her. Even without a chance to give a reply, I received an official letter at my house about an inquiry.
The inquiry was the manager, someone from HR and someone from the European chair.
To top it all off, the assistant-manager had given the manager a list off confidental documents that I 'have stolen from her private laptop'. Including that old file sitting somewhere on the server.

When they asked why I needed that file I started pointing out that the file was pointing to a huge flaw concerning legal documents and payments. The exact thing I was hired for.
By the end of the meeting it was clear that I was going out the door within a few days.
So, I started rattling up the cage.

I read my initial job description and the internal guidelines to the roll.
The 2 guys I was working with went into a frenzy to find any concequente from that error.
Site manager were alerted, accounting started making calculations.

The last email that I received was probably sent too early.
'OP falsified several documents on the server to get manager and assistant-manager into trouble. Any communication should be deleted by the end of the day'.

Needless to say, I had to pack my things.

3 months later I met some guys from the company. 
Turned out, the damage was done, but the coverup was even better.
The avalanche of people involved that quit was undeniable. And some departments involved had over 50% of workforce sitting at home due to mental issues.

The duo still works there, sitting on a lie that can still cost the firm millions a year since they still haven't solved the issue.

1m1ro3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1m1ro3o/found_my_root_cause_mcas/,Found my root cause!! MCAS,"TLDR: I found my root cause after 12 different doctors, it was Mast Cell Activation Syndrome. 

After over a year (5 GI docs, 3 primary care, 2 functional medicine, one neuro GI, 2 allergists) of doctors visits I was diagnosed with MCAS as the cause of my GI issues. 

I‚Äôve always had signs I guess, bad seasonal allergies, exercise induced asthma, and a tendency for sinus infections, but never GI problems. Until last summer I woke up one morning with horrible stomach pain. Now I will note that I suspect a lot of stressful events a year prior to this probably exacerbated everything (stress is the WORST thing for your health). It started as gastritis + early satiety all the sudden after I woke up and had my coffee, turned into esophagitis (non-EOS), lost 30+ pounds in 3 months due to slow motility and sudden constipation, lethargy, dizziness, heart palpitations, brain fog, etc. Gained some weight back due to PPIs but those gave me hyperplasia, stomach friability, and still have gastritis but less severe. The worst PPI symptom is insomnia for me. I hope to wean off of them soon (currently on 20mg Pantoprazole 2x a day).

Now that I‚Äôm diagnosed with MCAS I‚Äôll be doing allergy testing (again), allergy shots, and then layering on different treatments (avoiding triggers, lifestyle changes, allergy shots, vitamin shots, mast cell reducing medicines, and a bunch of allergy medicines).

I feel like I‚Äôm starting a new journey that was finding a diagnosis to now treatments. I wanted to share this to give anyone hope that you will find your root cause, and to not give up when doctors tell you they can‚Äôt help you! Some doctor somewhere will have the answer, you have to stay on top of your treatment, symptoms, and doctors and be your own advocate the entire time. If I had given up after the 5th GI doc I would have never found a solution. Be patient and do your own research because Reddit actually helped me the most in finding a diagnosis. 

Good luck and let me know if you have any questions! ",10,1752707604.0,ibs,2,0.86,False

1m1rlz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1m1rlz3/hr_the_colour_of_regret/,[HR] The Colour of Regret,"I look at the lilies placed on the passenger side of my car. I‚Äôve always loved flowers, just not the kind you buy at the shop. Sure, they look good - but they‚Äôre already dead; they just don‚Äôt know it yet. Usually, I wouldn‚Äôt buy them out of principal. Today feels different, though. I had to do something to show remorse. To show how sorry I am.

I was heading back from an art exhibition when my mother called to say Mr Derbyshire had been found dead in his home. The news stripped something away from me. Like ripping off a plaster to reveal a puss-filled wound festering beneath. I didn‚Äôt realise how much guilt I‚Äôd been holding onto all this time - until I heard the news. My silence helped ruin that mans life.

I found that I drove past my turn-off in a daze and just kept driving. Memories of that time playing over in my mind. Waves lapping over me like an ocean of guilt.

I often thought about how I‚Äôd one day go back and make amends. I‚Äôd apologise and make things right. I guess there was just always something in the way. You know how it is with these things: I‚Äôm too busy all the time, maybe in a few weeks or months when things quieten down. Or, he probably won‚Äôt even remember me, and if he does, he certainly won‚Äôt forgive me. Or, what would I even say? I‚Äôd just look a fool.

Suppose I just thought I had time. It seems Mr Derbyshire had other plans, however. My chance to say sorry is gone. So, flowers is the best I can do. A feeble attempt at redemption, but an attempt nonetheless. The same silence that ruined his life was the same silence that stopped me from making things right.

It took me a while in my trance-like state to realise I had drove myself to the path that lead to his home. I sat at the bottom of that drive, headlamps illuminating the long pine trees that lined it, creating a tunnel of light. In my rear-view mirror, the sky was slowly starting to turn orange and pink as the world woke up. How long have I been driving?

I wind the windows down - partly to let fresh air in because I‚Äôm so tired and partly to let the smell of my half eaten Big Mac out. The smell of the surrounding farms and woodland is refreshing. The pine-sap and wet earth bring back more memories of that time. Of games in the woods with friends. Of how Mr Derbyshire and his wife would often give us ice-cream and drinks in the summer. How Mr Derbyshire would sometimes build a den in the forest when it was raining.

The memories, just like the flowers on my passenger seat, inevitably turn sour. I remember her. I remember how we ruined the life of this wonderful man and woman. And, after everything he did for us; for me. I wouldn‚Äôt be the artist I am today if it wasn‚Äôt for him teaching me. He was a very talented artist, well respected. Until we showed up.

Years worth of sadness, guilt and anger all burst from their hiding places deep inside of me in a unified attack and I cry. I bang against the steering wheel of my car repeatedly, causing the the horn to sound and disturbing a few nearby birds. My hand feels sore, but I carry on. This pain is only a fraction of the damage I helped cause.

The sun has broken the horizon now. It‚Äôs warm light tracing up the path ahead, revealing the cottage that sits proudly against the backdrop of hills and forest. I drive slowly up, being drawn in like a moth to light.

The once beautiful gardens surrounding the house are now all dead. The grass overgrown and filled with weeds and rubbish. The skeletons of once lush plants stick their angry limbs in all directions. Plant pots are strewn about empty and cracked. The once vibrant ivy that lay sprawled across the front of the house now gone, leaving behind what looks like dirty veins, spreading in all directions. There‚Äôs a board covering one of the bottom windows and a netted curtain gentle flaps out of a hole in an upstairs window.

Is this how he was living? Shame rises up in me once again. I was responsible for this! If I had told the truth, this place would still be beautiful.

Grabbing the flowers, I get out the car. My legs unsteady from sitting for so long, so I take a moment to work the feeling back into them. The lilies look even more pathetic now I look around the place. Worthless and brittle. Destined to become a part of the death that surround this place. Another stain on the memory of it.

I walk up to front-door and place the flowers on the door step, but I notice the door is slightly ajar. Perhaps there‚Äôs a family member inside? I give it a gentle push further open and it squeals as though in pain. I peer in to the gloomy hallway.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I shout, my voice swallowed in the dusty haze. No response.

A sudden urge to go inside overwhelms me. I know I should probably turn and leave - but my wary legs have other plans.

The dust and debris under my feet crunches like snow as I step through the doorway. It‚Äôs dark, despite the morning sun. Almost like the sunlight itself wants nothing to do with this place. It smells of death and decay. I find a light switch and, to my surprise, it works. The light barely pushes the darkness back - dust particles fly across my vision, angry at being disturbed.

As my eyes adjust, I‚Äôm deeply disturbed by the state of the place. The once gleaming floral wallpaper, now looks as dead as the plants outside, parts of it stripped from the wall completely, other parts hang limp in a desperate attempt to cling on. Old pictures and painting have been spray-painted over by vandals, others lay on the floor ripped, shattered, broken. There are empty beer bottles and glass everywhere.

I turn to leave, a cold fear has been slowly creeping up on me and I feel a need to get out. But, as I turn, I notice other footprints in the dust and I hear a noise from the living room area. Maybe it‚Äôs a relative and they didn‚Äôt hear me the first time?

‚ÄúHello - is anybody there?‚Äù I call. No response again.

I tentatively make my way to the living room, following the dust-prints. I stare in shock at what they lead to.

It‚Äôs an oil painting of the cottage in all its glory. Mr Derbyshire‚Äôs signature sprawled in the bottom corner. It‚Äôs exquisite. The lighting, the brush-strokes, the colour, the composition, the mood. It feels like the painting is alive - a stark contrast to the murk that surrounds it. I marvel at all the tiny details, being drawn ever further in. A sudden thought occurs to me: Why has this remained untouched, while everything else here is decaying?

I try to take it down. Perhaps I can make amends to Mr Derbyshire by preserving his greatest work. I try to take it down, but it‚Äôs stuck fast. I can‚Äôt even get any purchase to look behind and see how it is connected. I take a step back and can‚Äôt help but gaze in wonder again.

I jump as my phone starts ringing. The sound breaks me from my dreamlike state and I fumble it out of my pocket, eager to answer quickly so I don‚Äôt disturb the eerie silence. It‚Äôs my mother.

‚ÄúHi, Mum. Everything okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, love. I was phoning to see if you‚Äôre okay? You said you‚Äôd call over this morning to help dad move some furniture.‚Äù

Shit - forgot about that.

‚ÄúSorry Mum, I drove down to Mr Derbyshire‚Äôs house to pay my respects.‚Äù Silence.

‚ÄúMr Derbyshire? Bit late for paying your respects, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe died years ago. I thought I told you?‚Äù

Fear grabs my heart and begins squeezing in a death grip.

‚ÄúYou phoned me late last-night and told me he‚Äôd been found dead!‚Äù

‚ÄúHoney, I was asleep by 8pm last-night. Are you sure you‚Äôre okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to go.‚Äù

I hang the phone up. I take one last glance at the painting and my heart stops. There is someone peering out of the upstairs window. Someone not there previously.

I turn to run and in my haste, I kick a brick laying on the floor and go tumbling. The corner of the solid oak coffee table rushes up to meet me.


                                                   *


A slither of light burns my eyes as I begin to open them. Pain pulses in my skull from the impact. I reach up to feel a huge lump and thank the Lord that I‚Äôm not bleeding. I struggle to sit up, feeling dizzy and disorientated.

‚ÄúIs anybody here?‚Äù I say, but get no response, again.

While my eyes are still adjusting, I notice the smells. The smell of oil paint, wood, canvas and art supplies. The smell of lavender, rosemary and thyme that Mrs Derbyshire had underneath the windowsills of the cottage. It smells like childhood.

Once my eyes have finally adjusted. I take in my surroundings with amazement. The house looks exactly like it used to - the death and decay are gone. Still unsteady, I sit on the old leather armchair Mrs Derbyshire used to use for knitting. I‚Äôm rubbing my temples as I observe the room. Everything is exactly how I remember it. Solid book shelves line the walls with all kinds of weird and wonderful books. There are paintings everywhere. All different shapes and sizes and colours. The brick fireplace crackles away as logs burn and give off a warm glow.

What the hell is going on? Am I dreaming right now?

The fireplace catches my eye. There‚Äôs something not quote right. Terror seizes me. The embers flicking up from the main fire look like orange brush strokes that quickly fade away. The flame themselves look like a million invisible brushes are slashing away at a canvas with red and orange and yellow paint. I look to the rest of the room and notice it‚Äôs the same - everywhere. Everything looks painted. Everything a brush stroke. Surfaces with an oily sheen glistening in the painted orange light. I trace my finger along one of the strokes on the leather chair. It comes away with brown paint on it.

I quickly stand, panting. I try to wake myself up from this nightmare - but, deep down, I know I‚Äôm not dreaming.

I need to leave. Now!

I head to the exit. Grabbing the heavy brass door handle. I can feel the tiny grooves in the paint from the brush strokes. I pull and it melts in my hand. Cold browns and greys cake my hand in a thick sludge. A messy splat of paint sits where the door handle used to be. Panicking, I stick my fingers in the letter box and pull and more paint splatters on me. Going from solid to liquid as soon as I apply pressure.

I run to a window. Draw the curtains back, the feeling alien in my hands. I try to look out the window but there‚Äôs just reflections painted on it. The illusion of a window. I turn and grab a lamp off the table next to the leather chair and throw it, with all my strength. It gets swallowed by the window, the colours mixing before it returns to a bluish black, ripples gently radiate out from the impact.

Turning to head to the back door I stop dead in the hallway. There‚Äôs a painting of her - Tammy. My partner in crime. The one who started all this. My first serious girlfriend. She looks menacing in the painting. I slowly walk to the next painting. This one shows me sitting at an easel with Mr Derbyshire as Tammy sits looking bored. I know where this is heading. The waves of shame and guilt now tsunamis.

I walk down the row of paintings, each one showing a detailed drawing of the past. I don‚Äôt need to look, but I do. How Mr Derbyshire was giving me a painting lesson one day while Tammy sat bored. How she asked to use the toilet but went and stole a sapphire ring that belonged to Mrs Derbyshire‚Äôs grandmother. How Mr Derbyshire confronted us and said he was going to the police. How he grabbed Tammy‚Äôs wrist when she started to get aggressive. How she went to the police first and accused him of trying to sexually assault her. How he got arrested. How he lost his job. How the stress caused Mrs Derbyshire to suffer a heart attack which later lead to a stroke. How local teenagers terrorised them for years after.

How I stayed quiet. Like a coward. The last painting in the row - I deserve. It‚Äôs of me with my with eyes and mouth sewn shut. I begin crying again.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so so so sorry! I should have spoken up. I should have done something.‚Äù

I hear a woman laughing. I look to the stairs and feel that urge to walk up them, despite every fibre in my body telling me not to. Upstairs, I stop and wonder what direction the sound came from. I don‚Äôt need to wonder for long as the paintings on the walls all show crimson arrows, wet and dripping. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs blood or paint. My breath heavy and body shaking, I come to the master bedroom and open the painted door.

Upon entering I am revolted by what I find. Laying on the bed, in an eternal scream, lay Tammy. I haven‚Äôt seen her for years - but this is unmistakably her. There‚Äôs thick black paint dried and crusted coming out of her orifices. The blue sapphire held in her outstretched hand.

I collapse to the floor, back against the wall, sobbing. Not for Tammy, not for myself. For Mr and Mrs Derbyshire.

I‚Äôm startled as the sapphire falls from Tammy‚Äôs hand as she melts into the bed. I grab it without thinking and stand back up backing into the wall. She vanishes, a red stain where she laid.

I feel a breath slither across my ear and let out a scream as I recoil, landing on the bed. I turn to find a painting of Mrs Derbyshire, deformed and wild. She begins crawling out, paint dripping from her skeletal arms. I hear her cackling as I run from the room.

I sprint to another room. The painting in the hallway now whirring and slithering as things began to ooze out of them. I slam the door behind me, grab a paperweight from a desk and head to the window, praying it will work this time. I draw the curtain back and stop in disbelief as I look out.

Outside, I see myself in the dingy old living room where I banged my head. I see myself jump as my phone rings. I see the fear in my eyes. I see myself look directly at me before turning to run.

I hear the noises coming closer of unseen nightmares dripping their way towards me. I turn slowly as tears burn down my cheeks. The door opens. A painted Mrs Derbyshire stands, eyes filled with fury and hate. Black painted shadows drip and cackle behind her like a thousand children laughing manically.

I drop to my knees. Mrs Derbyshire was a kind, caring woman. Is this what my lack of action done to them? I‚Äôm saying how sorry I am in-between sobs now as the drips come slowly closer. I see her blue slippers as she stops in-front of me. The blue reminds me of the sapphire that I‚Äôm still holding. I look up into her eyes and offer her the sapphire back.

‚ÄúPlease believe me, I truly am sorry, Mr and Mrs Derbyshire.‚Äù I whisper.

I know my time has come, but at least I finally get to apologise. I close my eyes as I drown in paint. Just before the paint takes me, I hear my own voice from downstairs -

I‚Äôm an 19 year old female and today when out with my friend in the city I felt fine the whole day but right as we waited for the bus home I suddenly felt tired,  ill, then I vomited and experienced some diarrhoea and I‚Äôm going to list everything that may have caused it because I‚Äôm kinda worried about it as I cancelled a driving lesson over it.

Reasons:
1) Too much coffee? I had a latte and a monster energy drink however I‚Äôve never been sick over too much caffeine, the most I get is bad gas and some anxiety at worst
2) I am on my period. When I‚Äôm on my period and have bad cramps I sometimes feel a bit sick however I have never actually vomited over this. Although I am quite thin and get lightheaded often, could this be a valid reason? I also want to add that period and caffeine would give me diarrhoea.
3) Anxiety, sometimes when I get really nervous I throw up but I had nothing really to be anxious about in that moment.

It wasn‚Äôt a particularly hot day today either (24¬∞C/75¬∞F). Dudnt get sunburnt either and only vomited at one occasion but felt close to doing it again for about 40 minutes waiting to be picked up by my dad. The rest of the evening I felt tired and heavy headed and typing this out I still feel a little sick in an ‚ÄúI need to burp way‚Äù and I can‚Äôt.

1m1rjd8,https://media.delawarenorth.com/delaware-north-awarded-new-business-at-boise-airport/,The wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing deceiving the west,"Longer post, so only read if you are truly interested in understanding how one company is creeping into the west and using local company equity to build on their empire. 

Delaware North ‚Äî a simple, innocuous name with a rotten underbelly.  This company now owns all of the concessions at the airport as well as over two dozen companies around Yellowstone, low income housing projects funded by taxpayer dollars in Boise, Bozeman, Gardiner, Kalispell, Meridian, Caldwell, and West Yellowstone ‚Äî as well as numerous hotels across the state.  

For some really quick snapshots, here is some of the companies lowlights, which include, but are not limited to: 

1) Trademarking the naming rights to Yosemite National Park, Curry village, and the Ahwahnee tribal name and hotel, for which the public paid millions for the naming rights to these iconic locations back.  

https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-icymi-the-corporate-grab-behind-the-yosemite-trademark-clash-20160229-column.html

2) Buying up the oversnow toll bridge and your public access to Yellowstone in the winter.  

3)  Bombing a reporter who tried to report on their east coast connections, and dozens of other shady dealings in Arizona.  

https://tucson.com/1976-reporter-killed-in-car-bombing/article_430f28a8-c5f3-11e5-8eeb-8bb7bb6bc9df.html

4)  Union busting in Yellowstone using convicted felons to replace local workers.

So, before you bite into that overpriced microwaved burger at the airport, take a swig of sewage coffee at Einsteins bagels, or eat anything from the soon to be opened Delaware North brand operated Treefort shop pre-security (yeah, they even bought out those rights), just know that you are financially supporting low wages, killing of journalists, and a New York family with deep ties to takeovers, anti- women‚Äôs rights, and back door monopolies. 

Oh yeah, their grandson is a representative in the House for New York (R), and their chief legal counsel is the husband of the governor of New York.

He pretended not to be dating me in-front of her friend at a coffee shop. Then, he went to a bar with his friends knowing his ex was there. I only found out because I saw his friend warned him on text his ex was at the bar. He planned on never telling me.

It‚Äôs causing so much distress in our relationship. I don‚Äôt know how to fix my jealousy of her. I keep stalking her accounts and compare how we look and how much more popular and outgoing she is compared to me. I feel like deep down, he still likes her more than me, and if she hadn‚Äôt broke up with him they would still be together.",2,1752707137.0,retroactivejealousy,2,0.75,False

Rainy day so old and new. Catnip and cat mint planted in recycled wood work horses. Herbs planted under the coffee sack hammock. Drift wood and old coffee sacks, everything except main uprights and netting is recycled or repurposed. The tunnels a test and work in progress. Laila our adopted cat is loving it. She was a homeless mum of 5 new borns rescued from under another house by the SPCA. ",23,1752707026.0,Catio,2,1.0,False
