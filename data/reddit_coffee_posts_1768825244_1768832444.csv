I registered the warranty when I got so when then motor stopped working in late December, I reached out to customer support for help. 

Support initially replied and asked for additional information, pictures and a video demonstrating the issue. I sent everything and support confirmed that they would send a new motor. I received an email saying the order for the motor was confirmed but I never received and email saying it shipped. When I reached otu to customer support about this, they confirmed that the motor was shipped and they would send a tracking number. 



I was not sent the tracking number and I have followed up several times over the past few weeks with no response from customer support for weeks. The motor has also not arrived. At this point, I am very disappointed with my experience with Varia and am considering switching brands. It sucks because I just got new burrs and was excited to try them out. Not sure what to do at this point, I sent another email to Varia but at some point it feels like a lost cause.

Those lists aren’t useless, but they also don’t tell you what it’s actually like to live somewhere. Some of the happiest buyers I worked with ended up in towns that never crack a Top 10 list, but they like their neighbors, walk to a local coffee spot, and actually plan on staying for a while. That idea of putting down roots and building real community feels pretty fitting for today.

NJ has a lot of towns like that. Not flashy, not trending on Instagram, but solid places where people stay long-term and life feels normal in a good way. Towns that come to mind are Collingswood, Red Bank, Haddon Township, and some of the towns outside of Westfield like Garwood and Mountainside, to name a few. From a real estate standpoint, those tend to age pretty well too.

And for what it’s worth, I don’t actually have the day off. The market has been moving fast this January already. If this is the pace now, spring should be interesting.

A place tucked deep within the Appalachian Mountains, where it's sunny one day of the year, and either rained or snowed for the remainder of it. A place where the local livestock tended to be more interesting than the vast population. A place where crackheads ran rampant through the streets, snorting/shooting anything they could get their hands on. A place where cops took bribes and turned a blind eye to most crime. A place where the mayor cuts funding for the local elementary school, resulting in multiple cases of hypothermia among staff and students alike. Although it sounds like this place has its fair share of perturbed and strange individuals, it also has other problems.

Sometimes people who had lived there for years would disappear without a trace. Livestock or even people would be mutilated in ways that matched no local story anyone had ever heard. Drifters and runaways would appear for a few days to a week and then disappear without a trace. Sure, they could've just moved on. I wouldn't have blamed them if they did. But when the local sheriff's departments started finding the clothes they were last seen in folded neatly by the lake, with their belongings stacked on top, well... things got weird around town.

But amidst all the chaos, the oddities, and the meth addicts, was a man trying his best to live his life as quietly as possible. That man was me.

Thankfully, I don't live there anymore. I could sit here and bore you with the details of why I don't, but I'll give you the cliff notes version of it. My town was hiding a dark secret, and I was the one unlucky enough to uncover it. Maybe one day I'll tell you the whole story, but until then, it's staying with me. For now, I'm here to tell you a few tales. Tales from a town I wish I could forget, but sadly can't. Tales that I, for one reason or another, felt the need to write into a large notebook to document. And although I could barely read my own intelligible handwriting as well as most of the pages being soaked in my blood and many other people's blood, I was able to transcribe a couple that made me say, ""What the fuck?""

Some of these I recall quite well, while a few I don't remember as much. My memory back then was really jumbled between conspiracies and hiding bodies for a while, but never mind that.

So sit back and relax, grab a cup of coffee (or a shot of whiskey if you're feeling adventurous), and enjoy part one of Tales from the Appalachians.

**OCT. 29th. XXXX**

Tonight just seems to be getting weirder and weirder.

I just recently took a job working at the only 24-hour grocery store in town, and needless to say, it was exactly what I needed. After what I did, I need something slow and monotonous. Something to keep my mind off the gore. What the owner failed to mention was just how often the crazies in our town wandered in here. I say they're crazy because of what just happened to me a few minutes ago.

I hadn't been in the store for maybe an hour when he came in. At first, I wasn’t sure if what I was seeing was real or not, but sure enough, there he was, dressed head to toe like The King of Rock and Roll himself (Elvis Presley, for all you younger folk). He walked in like he owned the place, hips swiveling so much I half expected his upper half to come loose and fall onto the floor, his sunglasses perched perfectly atop his nose, even though the fluorescent lights weren’t all that bright in the first place, and the fact that it was two o’clock in the morning. I watched as he approached the snack aisle, then proceeded to stare at the rows of chips for longer than anybody should have needed to make a selection.

“Ahem…” I cleared my throat. “Is there anything I can–”

“You know,” he said, pointing at a bag of off-brand nacho cheese-flavored chips with a dramatic flourish, “these disrespect The King. They lie about the taste.” 

I blinked a few times, trying to process whether he was genuinely serious or just high off of a crackheads latest supply. “ I, uh… I’m sorry?” I blurted out.

He then turned to face me, giving me a smile like he was about to tell me the greatest secret on earth. “Do you understand, young man? The King demands respect!”

At that point, I was sure he was high as a kite, so I just nodded, muttering something about having to rearrange the canned food display in the corner of the store, and went about my business. But as I worked, I caught him arguing with the cooler where all our beer was kept, swearing up and down that it owed him royalties. A small part of me wanted to ask what he was even talking about, and a slightly larger part of me wanted to laugh at the absurdity of it all, but I didn’t. 

Once he’d finally finished arguing with the cooler, he picked up a bag of Dr. Nachos and came to the counter. I rang him up, and he paid for the bag entirely in nickels. After painstakingly counting each coin to make sure the total was right, I handed him his purchase and his receipt. “Have a good night, sir,” I said as he started towards the door.

But before he left, he paused, turned back to me with a grin, and nodded at me. “Thank ya. Thank ya very much…” Then walked out the door, into the vast darkness.

I shook my head as I watched him disappear into the night, probably to go eat his bag of Dr. Nachos and smoke more meth. Only in this town… Only in this town would someone show up dressed like Elvis, exclaim that a bag of chips was “disrespectful,” then argue with a cooler about royalties to a song he probably didn’t even make. It was ridiculous. It was absurd. And yet, somehow it fit. I just laughed quietly to myself for a while after that, trying to convince myself it was funny rather than weird. But, I still can't shake the way he smiled at me right before he left.

\--------------------

**NOV. 25th. XXXX**

I'm sitting in my car writing this with a broken nose and more than a few broken ribs, but this can't wait. Things around town have been escalating recently and nobody knows I'm the one to blame for it, but that's besides the point, I need to get this off my chest.

I was sitting at the bar late last night contemplating how to hide a body when I got the sense I was being watched. Lately that seems to be the case, and the ones who were watching me before weren't very nice people, so I lifted my head and began scanning the bar when my eyes landed on her. She was standing just in the entrance of the doorway, leaning against the archway right by the front door. She looked roughly my age, short with dark auburn, and oddly glowy and transparent. When she seen I was finally making eye contact with her, she extended her arm and waved at me to follow her.

I'm not sure what thought came next to compel me to stand and begin walking towards her, but lately I've learned it's just best not to question anything and go with it, so I did just that. She led me out of my stool, out the front door into the cool night air and then started towards the tree line behind the bar. Every part of my body knew better than to go out into the dark forest at five o'clock in the morning, but something else was calling to me. A beautiful voice, beckoning me to follow. So I did.

I followed the mysterious woman into the woods, walking for what felt like hours when I finally snapped out of whatever trance I was in. I didn't know how long I'd been walking, but I did see what had made me stop walking. A small stone effigy in the middle of a four-way path with a small lantern sitting on top of it, each path branching off a different way into the woods. Once I finally realized how stupid I was for following what was most definitely a hallucination, I turned and began to walk back the way I had came.

I walked uphill, and gracefully fell downhill a few times until I finally spotted a clearing in the trees. With joy I flung myself into the clearing and hit the ground with a solid, hard thump. But instead of hitting the asphalt of the bar's parking lot, I hit more dirt. I opened my eyes and looked up and there I was, back at the four-way path with the stone effigy in the center. I slowly stood back up. That didn't make sense to me, I hadn't gotten turned around on the pathway I'd come from, so how did I end up back there? I figured I'd just gotten the paths confused while following the ghost lady, so I picked a different path. This time, I made sure to keep moving straight.

I jogged uphill, fell downhill, and crossed a rickety wooden bridge until I saw it again. A clearing, but instead of they joy I'd felt earlier I was met with this sense hesitation as I stepped into the opening. That hesitation quickly faded to dread as I saw that damn effigy, sitting in the middle of the four-way path. What the hell was going on? Why did I keep ending up right back there? Out of pure desperation I tried the other two paths, hoping one would lead me out of that hellhole, but each time I just ended up right back at that damn stone effigy.

Eventually, my brain turned back on and I remembered I had a cellphone with a built in GPS and I was maybe in range of some sort of cell tower. A renewed sense of hope filled my system as I yanked the device from my pocket and switched the screen on. When I saw I had only one bar, my hope nearly flatlined, but that one bar kept it alive. I quickly started texting, I knew calling was going to be no use but I had to try something. Once I had texted anyone I knew that could find me, all I could do was sit there and hope one of them went through.

The first few hours were dark and cold. I was confused as to why the sun hadn't come up when I finally checked the time on my phone. The time was frozen at 6:39 AM exactly, and hadn't moved for god knows how long. That's when a thought hit me, one that I should've had hours ago. Maybe I shouldn't have followed a ghost lady into the woods. After that mild stroke of genius, I tried to keep track of the time by using the stopwatch on my phone. It got up to twenty-seven hours before the battery finally died. I hate myself for wasting my battery on something that dumb now, but I think it helped, even if it was just for a night.

After that night, time became weird. I wasn't sure how much time had passed but it felt like days passed before I finally moved from that clearing and started to map the woods. Nobody had come to save me, and I wasn't too keen on dying of starvation or thirst. Thankfully, I came across a small spring while mapping the east side of the woods, and eventually, I had even made routine.

Wake up, forage the woods, map the woods, rinse, repeat. The time that felt like days turned into weeks, then those weeks felt like months. And by what I thought was the second month I had given up. I'd mapped every inch of the woods until I ended up back at the clearing and there was nothing. No way out. No help. Just trees and that damn effigy. Eventually I stopped getting up. I stopped foraging for food. I just laid there, waiting.

Days passed like that. Me laying there, waiting for whatever it was I believed would come if I waited. I knew it sounded crazy, but part another part of me felt like if I was patient and waited, something had to change. And one morning it did, and I was awoken from my slumber by a harsh kick to the ribs.

I jolted awake quickly, reaching for my makeshift spear by my bed of leaves. But instead of grabbing the rough handle of a branch, my hand grabbed at nothing but grass.

""What the fuck are you doing?"" Murphy asked.

I stared up at him with a look of bewilderment. If this was the Murphy that owned Murphy's Bar then... I looked behind him, the bar coming into clear view. I looked back up at Murphy who was staring down at me with a look of worry mixed with irritation. I didn't even know what to say, I just stood upright and hugged him as tightly as I could, mumbling about how I'd been gone for months and nobody had come to look for me after I left the bar that night.

Murphy pulled away from me after a few seconds. ""Kid, what are you talking about?""

I wiped the snot and tears from my face and started to explain that I'd left the bar a few months ago and got lost in the woods, and nobody came looking for me.

Murphy's look of worry worsened as he spoke slowly. ""Uh, kid... that was only two nights ago.""

I looked at him. He looked at me. Then, I simply thanked him for clarifying and walked back to my car to drive home for a nice shower.

**DEC. 30th. XXXX**

Just woke up after my ""accident"". At least that's what the doctors called it. That damn Aussie. Beat me nearly to death and mangled my hand beyond recognition. They doctors say I'm lucky to be alive. Then again, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy. I just hope that's the last I see of that lunatic. Him and his big friend.

1qh55n7,https://www.reddit.com/r/sparrowsharedliving/comments/1qh55n7/why_modern_room_listing_sites_are_changing_shared/,Why modern room listing sites are changing shared living completely,"I’ve been thinking a lot about how much shared living and room rentals have changed in Canada over the past decade, and the shift has been bigger than it seems.

Not too long ago, finding a place to live or a housemate was so chaotic. Most of us relied on word-of-mouth through friends, the boards at universities or coffee shops, or vague online classifieds while hoping the person on the other end wasn't a total nightmare. There was basically minimal information and no structure, and you were mostly going on gut feeling and luck. You often showed up hoping the place matched the description and that the people felt safe and compatible.

Today, modern room listing platforms have completely changed that experience. For once, trust and safety are no longer optional. Identity checks, clearer profiles, and review systems make it easier for both renters and hosts to feel confident before committing. 

There’s also much better visibility. Instead of a handful of local leads, renters can see options across entire cities, and hosts can reach people who are actually looking for shared living and not just whoever responds first.

What really stands out to me is how organized and intentional shared living has become. Clear expectations, structured communication, and flexible arrangements have made room rentals feel like a legitimate housing option rather than a last resort. This really matters in Canada, where rising rents and limited supply have made full units expensive for many.

I am seeing that shared living is becoming a practical solution for students, professionals, seniors, and people in transition. It really has evolved from something informal and risky into a structured, viable way to live well in expensive cities.

# Chapter 1

Aurora

I had never heard silence quite like the one that hung over Lupinhollow.

I leaned my forehead against the cold car window. Even through the glass, I could feel the woods pressing in—old and heavy. The trees weren’t like the ones in the city. They didn’t whisper; they towered. Dark pines rose on both sides of the road, so thick they blocked out the sun. It was just past noon, but it already looked like dusk.

Mom hummed quietly along with the radio. Some soft indie ballad. She tapped the steering wheel out of rhythm while Dad snored in the passenger seat, mouth open like a cave. He’d insisted on driving the first five hours of the trip and then passed out as soon as the road got twisty. Figures.

I pulled my hoodie tighter around my arms. August wasn’t supposed to feel like October.

The welcome sign flashed by so fast I almost missed it.

**Welcome to Lupinhollow—Est. 1812.**

**A Howling Good Time Awaits!**

I snorted. “Seriously?”

Mom just smiled, her eyes still on the winding mountain road. “Local charm, baby.”

„Local cringe,“ I muttered.

But I wasn’t really annoyed. Just…tired. Nervous, maybe. A little cold. Everything felt different today—the air, the trees, even the sunlight—and I didn’t know if that was the town or just me.

We rounded a curve, and suddenly, like something out of a painting, the college came into view.

At first, I thought it was a castle. Out of nowhere, this massive stone building appeared through the trees, covered in ivy like something from a fantasy movie. It had tall, pointy roofs, old arches, and windows so thin they looked more like arrow slits than anything else. It wasn’t ugly—in fact, it was pretty cool—but it definitely didn’t look like any college I’d ever seen.

A chill ran down my neck.

“This is it,” Mom said softly, “Moonbound Academy.”

I wanted to ask why it is called that, but the words stuck in my throat. I didn’t want to sound dumb, especially since they’d spent the last six weeks hyping this place up. “Best-rated private boarding college in the region,” Mom had said. “Top-tier academics, incredible wilderness programs, full scholarship—what’s not to love?”

I’d heard it all already. And yet now, sitting in the shadow of this dark, towering place, I had the sinking feeling that I’d missed something important.

„Looks more like a haunted monastery than a college,” I murmured, only half-joking.

Dad woke up with a grunt and rubbed his face. „We here?“

Mom pulled into the lot and found a spot next to a bunch of other cars. Students were everywhere, dragging suitcases or tossing duffel bags over their shoulders. I was expecting classic prep school vibes—dress pants, cardigans, maybe some quiet kids with thick glasses and big books. But nope. Everyone looked like they’d just stepped off the set of some supernatural teen show. Lots of leather jackets, combat boots, and dark circles under their eyes like it was a fashion statement.

Some of them were laughing, sure—but not loudly.

And then I noticed something else.

They were staring at me.

Not in a new-girl kind of way. Not even in a ‘who’s she’ way.

They stared like I was…off. Wrong. Something just out of place enough to make them squint.

I shifted in my seat.

“Don’t overthink it,” Mom said, glancing at me in the rearview mirror. „They’re just curious.“

But they weren’t looking at her. Or Dad. Just me.

Mom killed the engine. The silence that followed wasn’t normal silence—it was alive. The kind that made your ears ring a little. I could hear the wind moving through the trees, like the whole forest was breathing.

“Come on, sweetheart,” Dad said as he climbed out, stretching like he hadn’t just spent hours snoring. “Let’s find the front office.“

I stepped out of the car, the gravel crunching under my sneakers. It was cooler here, even for August. Not cold, exactly, but the air had weight. I pulled my hoodie tighter, fingers fidgeting with the cuffs.

The students kept watching me as we walked by. Their faces didn’t really change. Some squinted, others just stared. I tried to smile at a girl with a silver braid and big boots.

She didn’t smile back.

The main building towered above us. Its black stone covered in creeping ivy. Over the double doors, carved deep into the archway, were words in latin: Luna Vincit Omnia

“What’s that mean?” I asked, staring up at it.

Dad shrugged. “Something about the moon freeing all. You know your mom took Latin in college, not me.“

He was wrong, but I didn’t correct him. I’d seen the phrase before—in a brochure they gave us in the acceptance packet. *The Moon conquers all.*

I remember thinking it sounded ominous then. It still does now.

Inside, the entryway was somehow darker than outside. The lighting was dim, everything cast in this soft gold glow that made the shadows stretch longer than they should. The floor was stone, the ceilings high enough to echo, and the air smelled faintly of sage and something sharp—like iron or earth after rain.

A woman sat at the front desk, clacking away at a keyboard. She looked…distracted. Early thirties maybe, a coffee mug tucked between both hands, earbuds in like she hadn’t noticed we were standing there.

“Uh, hi,” Mom said gently.

The woman startled, tugged out one earbud, and smiled too wide. “Oh! Hello! Sorry. You must be the Wells family. Aurora, right?“

„That’s me,“ I said, lifting a hand in a tiny wave.

“Right, right. Okay, I’ve got you here…” She squinted at the screen. “Aurora… Dorm 3B. Assigned roommates… four of them—wow, you’re going to have a full house.”

She slid a manila folder across the desk toward me. “This has your schedule, a campus map, and a few rule sheets. Someone from dorm 3 will meet you to show you around in a bit.“

“Thanks,” I said, trying to peek at the paperwork inside the folder. The class names looked weird—Lunar Pathfinding, Pack Psychology, Advanced shifting theory. I blinked at the last one.

“Uh…shifting?”

The woman blinked. “Mmm?” Then her eyes widened. “Oh! Oh no, wait. Did I—?“

Mom leaned forward, brows knit. „Is something wrong?“

“No! No, no, I just—uh, it’s fine. Everything’s in order.” She gave another too-bright smile and waved her hand. “Welcome to Moonbound! You’re going to love it here.“

I didn’t believe her.

Neither did my mom, by the look on her face.

But before either of us could say anything, a tall, dark-haired guy stepped into the room.

# Chapter 1

Aurora

I had never heard silence quite like the one that hung over Lupinhollow.

I leaned my forehead against the cold car window. Even through the glass, I could feel the woods pressing in—old and heavy. The trees weren’t like the ones in the city. They didn’t whisper; they towered. Dark pines rose on both sides of the road, so thick they blocked out the sun. It was just past noon, but it already looked like dusk.

Mom hummed quietly along with the radio. Some soft indie ballad. She tapped the steering wheel out of rhythm while Dad snored in the passenger seat, mouth open like a cave. He’d insisted on driving the first five hours of the trip and then passed out as soon as the road got twisty. Figures.

I pulled my hoodie tighter around my arms. August wasn’t supposed to feel like October.

The welcome sign flashed by so fast I almost missed it.

**Welcome to Lupinhollow—Est. 1812.**

**A Howling Good Time Awaits!**

I snorted. “Seriously?”

What should I do?","I’m 29, work in IT, and I’m in a smaller town where everyone kinda already has thier people. A few months ago I started going to a weekly trivia night at a local place. I ended up clicking with a group of 5-6 folks who go most weeks. They’re funny, not rude, and I genuinely enjoy being around them. The issue is I almost always feel like I’m hovering on the edge of the circle. They have years of inside jokes and shared stories, which is normal, but it’s more like… I’m there, but I’m not really in it. In the group chat, my messages get “liked” or ignored a lot, then the convo keeps moving. If I ask a direct question, someone answers, so it’s not like I’m totally invisible, but it doesn’t feel warm either. When we’re in person it’s better, yet I still notice little stuff: they’ll make plans for the weekend while I’m standing right there, and nobody says “you should come.” If I invite myself (like “oh that sounds fun”), they’ll say “yeah sure,” but it feels awkward. I’ve tried being the one to organize something a couple times. One time only two people showed, and it turned into them talking about memories with the others and me kind of smiling along like an idiot. Another time people said “maybe” and then it fizzled. The confusing part is that 1-on-1, any of them are nice. It’s the group vibe where I feel like a spare part.

So I’m stuck. Do I keep showing up and let time do its thing, even if it makes me feel kinda crappy after? Do I try to build actual friendships one person at a time (coffee, a walk, whatever) and stop expecting the group to “adopt” me? Or do I take the hint and back off before I get more attached and resentful. I don’t want to corner someone with a heavy “do you even like me” talk, that feels dramatic and honestly embarrassing. But i also don’t want to waste months trying to squeeze into a circle that’s closed. What would you do here, and how do you tell the difference between “normal new person awkwardness” and “they’re polite but not interested”?

We top up on pay day and adhoc throw a few hundred on each here and there. I end up getting a lot of family expenses on my personal account, and in turn he will try and balance the books and he will then put things on his personal account 

I asked for us to sit down and go through each of our personal accounts along with our joint account to try and see the true number of how much we’re spending to run our family. I explained my goal is to bring all of those hidden costs to light, so that we can see where our money is going. Once we can do that, it will be easier for us to see what a realistic budget should be. At the moment, with our personal accounts being totally private and hidden from the other, it’s a huge unknown. 

I had a baby a year ago and took 6 months off unpaid. We have maintained our lifestyle in large because I emptied my savings to fund my half of our life. I still get big ticket items (anything furniture or big bills etc seem to come my way). Despite this, husband said he’s also depleted his savings and he’s on his overdraft. 

I return to work in 2 weeks and am going part time to care for our baby, meaning I’m going to be earning 40% less than I was before ( I was a relatively high earner)

I explained that I think sitting down to look at where our money is going to get the ship tight is important. This is where he got extremely defensive about sharing his account. It was a full blown argument out in public on a walk. He wasn’t backing down, but would occasionally say “fine we can but I don’t see why we need to do that” and circling around to why we’re not going to do it.

I just can’t understand why he is so touchy about it. For me, personal spending is just like a few expenses at coffee shops, a couple clothing stores, my insurance etc. I cannot understand why he is SO upset about it. Naturally, it makes me worried there’s something that would be damaging to our relationship for me to see. Am I crazy for fearing that?",1,1768831796.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

I'm looking for a single dose grinder to go with my Gaggia Classic E24 with the Gaggimate mod.

It's going to be used for espresso as well as milk drinks, with a slight focus on the latter. Currently not planning to brew filter coffee.

We prefer dark and medium roasts, but wouldn't mind experimenting with light roasts now and then.

After doing some research, I was basically set on getting the Niche Zero which would run me about 700€ here in Germany.  I'm drawn to this one because it has gotten so many great reviews especially for darker roasts and is supposedly relatively easy to dial in. 

However, I recently stumbled upon the Varia VS4 that was just released and was quite impressed. I really like how easily it can be taken apart for cleaning, I prefer the design over the Niche and on top of that I would save around 150€. The different burr sets that are supposed to become available soon could also be an interesting feature. Unfortunately, there's not a ton of info and reviews on the machine yet.

Now I'm torn whether I should go with the ""trusted"" choice and get the Niche or whether I should give the Varia a shot.

Has anyone here had a chance to compare them? Those who already have the Varia, are you happy with the grinder and the coffee? Or am I missing a better, third option?",1,1768831766.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I would call those dry and not sober since I never did the inner work. Anyways between the last 4 years I've been drinking I met a women my age and we had a great long term relationship of 2.5 years. We took mamy trips and talked about the future together.Our relationship started with us going out and drinking together and after a year or so she started to slow down cause she didnt like the way she acted when she was drunk. Anyways my alcoholic drinking didnt slow down. The last few months of the relationship she mentioned things were concerning with my drinking. (Blackouts/ over doing it most of the time) I knew it was a problem but being a problem drinker i said things would change but I kept drinking that way. 2 weeks after an amazing trip to Europe together, she caught me drinking and that moment reminded her of her fathers current alcohol struggles and she sees how it is ruining the marriage of her parents. So she ended the relationship. I knew I had to get sober for myself since this was the last straw in my alcoholism. We talked and she said you need to focus on yourself l and that she cant support me romantically right now and didnt want resentment to build while I got sober. She said at the time she wasnt giving up on us . I understand where shes coming from but I was very disappointed. I know I had to get sober but I felt abandoned. I know she has alot of fear about her repeating her parents dynamic especially her moms. We had a very loving non abusive relationship. Its been 3.5 months of me working hard at sobriety and doing thr inner work this time. I see things more clearly than ever. I asked if she wanted to get together for coffee sometime. I wanted to make amends and say that I was sorry but didnt tell her that. All I asked was if she wanted to get coffee some. She responded with I appericate you reaching out but right now that is not something that I am ready for...and I need more time, I hope you understand..........

Is this situation dead? Does this situation require more time than just 3.5 months to fix?I know she has alot of fear about alcoholism giving her dads untreated. I know im doing the right thing going to AA and being serious this time. I know I cant wait by the door for her to open it again and I just have to move forward in sobriety and hopefully let god/the universe sort this out.

I kept the cruise on, but played between eco, normal and sport mode. Having driven a manual for most my life, I’m particularly sensitive to engine rev. On Eco, the transmission felt like it was constantly hunting for gears to stay consistent, normal mode felt like there was a lack of power in the wind but not quite as much hunting for gearing and it felt like there was enough torque and power on sport mode, but always felt like there was a significantly higher rev. Made it to the office about 1.5 mpg less efficient, but overall the drive in sport mode was perceptively more responsive. I drive fairly regularly along very long swaths of highway with nothing else around (the Dakotas, Iowa, Indiana) and would drive it on cruise typically staying in eco mode. If you are in a high wind situation, punch it up a bit if you need to increase that responsiveness. Truth be told, if you have a cup of coffee in the center console long enough, you’re bound to go through the drive modes anyways since it’s nearly impossible to set down your cup without whacking into a different drive mode.

1qh4ynz,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyformat/comments/1qh4ynz/5_life_changing_journal_techniques/,5 Life Changing Journal Techniques,"Journaling doesn't require perfect prose or profound insights. The key to maintaining a 20-year journaling practice is starting simple and building consistency through methods that feel manageable, not impressive.

# Five Practical Journaling Methods

**Highlight Journaling**

Highlight journaling focuses on capturing one meaningful moment from your day in a single sentence. This could be something you're looking forward to or something you enjoyed after it happened. Starting with just one line about what you appreciated creates a low-pressure entry point that often naturally expands into deeper reflection once you begin writing.

**Daily Log**

The daily log approach treats your journal like a ship's captain's log—a straightforward record of events without emotional analysis. You simply note what happened: ""Got to work at 9:00, recorded a video, did a workout, met my brother for a beer."" This factual approach removes the pressure of profound writing while creating a valuable record of your days. You can add simple doodles if desired, but the focus remains on logging rather than analyzing.

**Gratitude Journaling** 

Gratitude journaling involves listing things you're thankful for each day. The practice works best when you identify specific, small details rather than grand concepts—your favorite jacket, a warm cup of coffee, or time spent with family. Challenging yourself to find something new and unique each day builds your awareness muscle and naturally improves your mood.

**Prompt Journaling**

Prompt journaling removes the challenge of deciding what to write by answering pre-written questions. Prompts might ask about your favorite book, a memorable character, or recent experiences. This method works particularly well for beginners because it eliminates decision fatigue and provides clear direction for each entry.

**Morning Pages**

Morning pages, popularized by Julia Cameron in ""The Artist's Way,"" involves stream-of-consciousness writing for two to three pages each morning. You write whatever comes to mind without filtering or editing, even if that means writing ""this is dumb"" repeatedly. This brain dump practice clears mental clutter and often leads to unexpected insights.

# Key Benefits of Consistent Journaling

* **Journaling increases self-awareness** by helping you understand your struggles, patterns, and authentic self through regular reflection.
* **Writing reduces stress levels** by externalizing concerns onto the page, allowing you to process rather than suppress difficult emotions.
* **Regular journaling improves goal alignment** by challenging you to examine why you're pursuing certain objectives and whether your daily actions match your stated priorities.
* **Journal entries create a searchable memory bank** that preserves experiences and insights you would otherwise forget over time.
* **The practice enhances productivity** by clarifying your why and helping you stay intentional about how you spend your time and energy.

Like, can’t get out of bed, can’t brush my teeth, can’t clean my house kind of depression. I dropped out of high school, barely passed an online program, and honestly just gave up on myself.

In my early 20s I fell into a ton of debt, wrecked my credit, isolated myself from everyone, and spent a lot of nights on the phone with suicide prevention. My life felt like it was completely falling apart and I genuinely believed I was going to be worthless forever with no direction.

Then I randomly found something I was actually passionate about — the funeral industry. On a whim, I applied for a part-time job at a funeral home and somehow got it.

At first I was doing really small stuff like stocking coffee during visitations and pointing people to the bathroom, but I worked hard and showed up every day hoping I could move up.

Now I’m in mortuary school to become a licensed funeral director and embalmer. I just took my first big exam and not only passed — I got a 95%.

I found out I am on the asexual spectrum last year. I've met some allosexual people who were sex-averse or sex negative.

I am unaware when strangers are feeling sexual attraction to me. I am aware of what attraction I am feeling towards women. For example, I went out on New Year's eve and a woman was looking at me. I thought she was feeling aesthetic attraction to me. If she was allosexual, she might have been feeling aesthetic and sexual attraction at the same time.

The woman who looked at me came with my friend. Her body language was a little weird. It seemed like she was a little bit nervous when she was near me.

If I approach a woman, it means I might be feeling aesthetic attraction to her or not. If an allosexual guy approaches a woman, it could mean he feels sexual attraction and aesthetic.

I used to describe some women as ""hot"" before I found out I am on the ace spectrum. I don't want to use that word anymore.

I think some women lost interest in me when I wasn't reciprocating sexual interest. In 2022, I went out for coffee with a woman. I didn't want to date her because I wasn't feeling aesthetic and romantic attraction. She lost interest in me and ghosted me.

Maybe I have to tell allosexuals I can't reciprocate their sexual interest right away. I know allosexuals also want emotional connections, but they also want sex.

I think communication for me is different from allosexuals. To me, going out for coffee was just a friendly outing. Maybe that woman thought it was a date. To me, dating is about showing romantic attraction and developing an emotional connection. I go out with my male friends all the time.

Drinking water is not enjoyable to me.

This is a scalable thing. Some days, I just don’t enjoy drinking it, other days I loathe it. I’m constantly dehydrated (which doesn’t help anyone or anything).

I have a collection of various cordials, and that helps me, I usually have a coffee in the morning and can then go a full day without any other liquid, (although sometimes I get a coconut water at lunchtime) get home from work and drink about 700mls of cordial in the form of two big glasses, and then will proceed to sip a glass or two more for the rest of the afternoon/evening/night.

If I can think ahead and have the right type of bottle on hand I can take cordial to work or out and can drink that fine, aside from the embarrassment I feel about drinking cordial like a child.

I have a sodastream and used to drink a lot of sparkling water, when at home and thought at least that was something, but my dentist told me to stop as the soda water was acidic and damaging my teeth.

We have a whole house filter (because I have terrible eczema otherwise) so the water in my house is actually really good, better than bottled water, that doesn’t mean I enjoy it, just means it’s not as terrible as other waters.

I literally went to lunch with a coworker today and we had tap water on the table and I felt like I was forcing myself to drink it (but I didn’t want to also buy soda with my lunch).

1qh4r2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1qh4r2v/cmv_the_threat_of_russia_or_china_seizing/,CMV:  The threat of Russia or China seizing Greenland is not plausible,"This is not a political post, I am not here to debate whether or not the United States nor any other nation should or should not seize Greenland.  I am uninterested in debating morality.  Trump is increasingly justifying his proposed annexation on the threat of either Russia or China seizing Greenland, and this post is **only** about the military realities that dictate how credible or not that threat may or may not be.  My view is that the threat is ludicrous, but I am open to evidence to the contrary.  

Apologies in advance for potential incoherence as I've not yet had my coffee.

Neither Russia nor China possesses a nuclear blue water navy capable of projecting power over long distances.  Both are effectively A2/AD forces, aka ""anti-access and area denial"".  They are reasonably effective at deterring aggression in their own waters and at perhaps controlling small spheres of influence outside of that space, and that's it.

1.) Neither of them could invade Greenland

The ability to project power halfway across the world and to lay off a fortified foreign target and remain fed and fueled while maintaining persistent air dominance over extended periods of time is the unique domain of the United States Navy and has been since the Second World War.  Invasions require air superiority in the 21st century and no other nation, including Russia and China, have the ability to project air superiority anywhere but proximate to their own shores.

By what routes would anyone propose those nations could invade Greenland?  Through the arctic?  There is no path from the west.  The east is the heavily defended and patrolled North Atlantic.  Through the Panama Canal, or around South America?  That's absurd, they would be turned to mist even \*if\* they had the supply capability to reach that far and they do not.  They would be far outside the operational envelope of their own land-based Air Forces while sailing ever deeper into our own.  It is not survivable.

2.) Neither of them could credibly threaten Greenland in any other way

Neither Russia nor China is located near enough to Greenland to be able to threaten it with any weapon other than nuclear ballistic missiles, and we are already all threatening each other with those on a daily basis.  

Those nations lack any sort of extreme range standoff precision strike capability that would enable them to do mount anything more than perhaps a hit-and-fade raiding attack on the island.  Even that is unlikely, given how heavily wired up the North Atlantic and Arctic is by Theater Undersea Surveillance Command.  It would be a dodgy notion at best to try and pop up and fire conventional cruise missiles from a submarine at Greenland, you're almost certainly going to lose that submarine.  It's a long way home.

What other scenarios are people envisioning here?  Paratroopers?  Space Lasers?

In closing, there is no credible military threat posed to Greenland or American facilities on Greenland by either Russia or China.

Change my mind.

Keychron has always had a reputation for making solid, slightly pricey “entry-level enthusiast” boards, but 2025 really felt like a year of growth and maturity for them. The biggest highlight was the refresh of their Q-series into the new **Q Ultra line**, which now features **ZMK firmware**. That change alone is huge — wireless life is dramatically better, and it finally feels like their wireless boards are competing on the same level as the rest of the enthusiast market instead of lagging behind.

Even more exciting was the shift in their HE lineup. Keychron is finally moving to **TMR sensors**, which is a tremendous step forward. This change means their HE boards will now support both **north-pole (Wooting-style) and south-pole (Nebula-style) magnetic switches**. That closes a major compatibility gap that previously made Keychron HE keyboards feel a bit limited and, honestly, kind of lame compared to the competition. With this move, they’re suddenly a much more serious player in the magnetic switch space.

Visually, the booth was packed with some wild experiments in materials. Keychron is clearly having fun pushing beyond the usual aluminum and plastic — they showed off keyboards made from **ceramic, wood, marble, resin, and even concrete**. It’s definitely a little kitschy and not for everyone, but I appreciate the creativity.

The ceramic board in particular was interesting. A lot of reviewers were pretty harsh on it, but seeing it in person, it actually wasn’t bad at all. That said, it’s nowhere near the quality or feel of Cerakeys products, and acoustically it still tends to sound a bit more “plasticky” than you’d expect. Cool concept, but more of a novelty than a must-have.

One non-keyboard product that really stood out was the **Keychron Nape trackball**. I didn’t expect to be impressed by it, but it’s a surprisingly versatile and comfortable little device. I can easily see it being perfect for tight spaces like coffee shops or shared conference tables. The only potential downside is placement — attaching it to the side of a laptop could be awkward depending on where that laptop’s I/O ports are located. Definitely a “your mileage may vary” situation, but still a clever idea.

Overall, Keychron came to CES with real improvements instead of just minor refreshes. Better firmware, better HE tech, and some bold design experimentation made their booth feel like one of the most forward-thinking in the keyboard space this year.

I help run a little monthly street market in my neighborhood, nothing fancy, just a row of tables for local makers and a few food stalls. We’re all volunteers, and the rules are simple because otherwise it turns into chaos fast: vendors check in between 7:00 and 8:00, first come first served on spots, and you cannot reserve space by dropping stuff off early. Last month i show up at 6:20 to set out signs and there’s already a lone folding chair in the best corner spot, with a sticky note that says ""DO NOT MOVE. I AM PARKING. THANK YOU."" No name, no vendor number, nothing. I figured someone was unloading real quick, so i left it for a minute. By 6:45 no one shows, but other vendors start arriving and asking what’s up, because the corner has power and foot traffic. So i move the chair to the side and put our ""Check In Here"" sign in the corner like normal. At 7:10 a woman marches up like she’s late for a court date and goes, ""Excuse me, you moved my chair. That spot is mine."" I tell her we don’t reserve spots and she needs to check in like everyone else. She says, totally serious, ""I did check in. With the note. I was here first."" Then she points at the power outlet and says she needs it because her card reader will die and she ""has customers who only use tap."" I offer her a spot two tables down that also has power, just not the corner, and she snaps that she ""always gets the corner"" because she ""brings people."" She starts listing random demands like i’m her employee: she needs shade, she needs to be near the coffee stall, she needs extra chairs for her friends, and also she should get a discount on the vendor fee because she’s ""helping the community."" I keep my voice calm and repeat: check in, pick from available spots. She tries a new angle and says she knows the organizer and that she’ll ""have me removed from the volunteer list."" That was funny because i am literally the person with the organizer text thread open, so i ask her what name she’s under. She says her first name and then adds, ""I don’t have to give you my last name."" I look at the vendor list and she’s not on it. I tell her she’s not registered, and she goes, ""I’m walk in VIP."" We do not have VIP. She pulls out a printed badge on cardstock that says ""MARKET VOLUNTEER COORDINATOR"" with a clip from a craft store. The twist is she picked the wrong title, because our actual volunteer badges are a different color and say ""Staff"" in big letters. I tell her politely that she can register for next month, but today is full. She stands there huffing while real vendors unload around her, then she tries to sit in the corner spot anyway like she’s squatting. Our lead organizer finally arrives, takes one look, and says, ""Oh, it’s you again. You’re still not allowed here."" Apparently she’d been kicked out of another local market for trying to bully vendors out of spots. She left with her chair and her fake badge, muttering about how nobody respects ""small business owners"" anymore, while the rest of us just kept setting up like nothing happened.

1qh4ma8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qh4ma8/my_31fco_worker_and_friend_37m_became_kind_of_an/,My (31F)co worker and friend (37M) became kind of an obsessive stalker and it might be my fault?,"Sorry in advance, but this is about to very long winded as it happened over about 3 years. 

So recently I (31F) realized that one of my friends (37M we’ll call him Alex) may have gone from being just a friend to kind of being a little obsessed and low key stalking me. I’ve always know he had a crush on me but he’s married and when we first met I was also married. To be clear, we were quite close so we’d talk at work about our relationships which probably wasn’t always the best idea considering I knew he had a thing for me. Before I decided to leave my ex I would complain about him to Alex and I return Alex would tell me things about his marriage that were less than perfect. From the beginning of our work friendship, Alex would bring me coffees everyday, he does this with multiple people but they have an order and he just picks up the coffees for them and they pay him at work. Alex would never accept my money. I would try and put the cash in his pocket, venmo him etc. but it was always returned with a stern “no you don’t ever pay” so eventually I stopped trying to give him money at all. When my marital problems started escalating, o wouldn’t bring dinner all the time or wouldn’t eat even if I did. So Alex noticed this and also saw I was losing weight so he started buying me food at least once a week. Once again I tried paying him and he wouldn’t accept. Over and over I tried to pay him and every time he denied me so like the coffees I just stopped trying. So Christmas comes along, and he gets me a gift that he splits with another coworker. I had no idea any of this was coming. So I in return bought them each Christmas gifts. 

This behavior continues for the next year. And eventually I leave my ex. It took a while for me to tell him because I wanted it to be just mine for a while without people fawning over the situation. Once he found out though, he was all over me “taking care of me” making sure I was ok and eating and all that. Don’t forget Alex is married with kids. So now I’m starting to feel some type of way about the situation. Now that I was single I think Alex really was able to see a future for us so he kind of latched on. People at work would make fun of him about it and he didn’t care. He eventually got transferred to a different department but would still bring me coffees. But what changed was that he would ask me to stop by his office to pick them up and I realized it was so people would see me going to see him. They started calling me his work wife which didn’t sit well with me. 

Now here is where it gets tricky. For my birthday, he wanted to take me to a restaurant it wasn’t a romantic restaurant just a casual dining Mexican place that he liked. While we were at dinner I realized what this was as he said “there’s only one person I’d cheat on my wife with but I don’t think shes into me and shes told me multiple times that she doesn’t get with married men or co workers.” This is true, I have said both of those things over and over to not just him but a lot of people at work (I work in a male dominated company). So I kind of sat there uncomfortable and said yea “probably not” and changed the subject. After the dinner he drove me back to my car and hugged me goodbye and I felt gross about the whole thing. I didn’t realize until I was in it that he was trying to use my birthday and my trust in his friendship as a way to see if I would be down to be his side chick. 

Since then it’s been non stop coffees, and candy and sodas. He would get me valentines gifts, birthday gifts and Christmas gifts. It’s been a total of 3 years 2 since the dinner. And he has just gotten more and more creepy. People would ask if we’re sleeping together and he would say “no but even if we were I wouldn’t tell you” which basically alluded to us sleeping together. He was trying to “claim” me as his at the job so no one else would try to get with me. He would take extra shifts with my department so we would be able to talk and spend time, he would legit lurk in the hallway just watching me from afar if I was talking to someone else and things like that. I’ve tried to tell him no more coffees or sodas or anything but he DOES NOT LISTEN! 

This year for my birthday he wanted to get me perfume and asked a coworker and close friend of mine what my favorite one was. My friend said “no need that’s inappropriate” and Alex said yea you’re right I won’t get her anything. But still one day when I was on my way to work Alex texted me to stop by his office to pick something up when he wasn’t there and I didn’t respond or go get it. So he left the bag on my car in the work parking lot. People saw him leave it there and said he was lurking around acting creepy about it to try and drop it off without being seen. 

The gift was to Etsy hand painted mugs, a candy bar and a soda. I lost it. I sent him a message saying his behavior was making me uncomfortable and I didn’t like the way it looked at work since people were commenting on his odd behavior so of we could stop exchanging gifts from now on” mind you I’ve only ever gotten him 1 Christmas gift 3 years ago. His response was “I understand, this place can be overwhelming. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable I’m sorry” ",2,1768830567.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I’m finding it difficult and looking for honest, grounded perspectives.

I (M) was in a 3.5-year relationship with my ex (F). It was genuinely loving, emotionally close, and stable for most of its duration. We were best friends. No cheating, no abuse, no major toxic patterns. A month before the breakup she was in tears telling me how deeply she loved me.

The breakup itself felt fear-based rather than because the love was gone. She said:

	•	She couldn’t see a future anymore

	•	She was scared about the distance and life pressures

	•	She felt like she was losing her best friend

	•	I’d been an amazing boyfriend

	•	She’d always love me

	•	She expressed regret and kept wavering emotionally during the breakup

She works as a cancer ward nurse and has been under extreme emotional strain. Her family life is also chaotic and stressful. She tends to shut down emotionally when overwhelmed.

At the breakup I didn’t beg or fight; I stayed composed even though I was devastated. A few weeks later (week 3), she reached out with a very warm congratulatory message after I completed a marathon, telling me she was proud of me and happy for me. At week 5, I asked her for coffee and she said it was too early and she didn’t want to make things harder. I replied respectfully and didn’t push.

Since then (now \~10 weeks post breakup):

	•	No contact from either side

	•	She still has our photos on Instagram

	•	She hasn’t unfollowed my close friends or my disabled brother’s account

	•	She hasn’t villainized me or reframed the relationship negatively

	•	But there’s been total silence otherwise

On my side, I’ve:

	•	Travelled

	•	Run a marathon

	•	Grown my business

	•	Been in therapy weekly

	•	Journaled and reflected deeply

	•	Stayed no contact

	•	Not chased, begged, or used mutual friends

Emotionally I’m a a bit stuck. I still love her deeply. I don’t want someone new. I want her. The silence is destroying me and I feel stuck in this suspended limbo where nothing is resolved.

What’s confusing me is the contradiction:

On one hand:

	•	She expressed regret during the breakup

	•	She reached out warmly after my marathon

	•	She hasn’t erased me socially

	•	She said she’d always love me

	•	The relationship itself was genuinely good

	•	The breakup felt fear-driven, not because the love died

On the other hand:

	•	10 weeks of near total silence

	•	No attempt to fix things

	•	No emotional reach-out beyond that one message

	•	No sign she wants to talk

I keep oscillating between:

“This isn’t really over, she’s just scared and overwhelmed”

and

“She’s moved on and I’m in denial.”

I’m now at a point where:

	•	I don’t know how long I can hold no contact

	•	I don’t want to sabotage any remaining chance

	•	I don’t know whether reaching out once would help or just confirm rejection

	•	I don’t know if I’m being realistic or just clinging to hope

My questions:

	1.	Does her keeping our photos and social ties mean anything at all?

	2.	Is 10 weeks of silence after a loving, fear-based breakup normal or basically a death sentence?

	3.	Would one gentle, low-pressure message help or hurt?

	4.	Am I being realistic about reconciliation or emotionally delusional?

	5.	If you were in my position, what would you honestly do next?

I don’t want sugarcoating.

I don’t want pickup-artist tactics.

I don’t want false hope.

I just want the truth.

When it comes to **Best Modular Kitchens**, island designs stand out due to their versatility. An island acts as the centrepiece, offering additional counter space, storage, and seating options. In modern homes, the island has become a multifunctional hub, ideal for meal prep, casual dining, and even entertaining guests.

The [**Latest Modular Kitchen trends** ](https://wurfel.in/modular_kitchen_design.php)emphasize personalization. Homeowners are no longer restricted to standard designs; modular systems allow for bespoke solutions. For instance, the island can feature built-in stovetops, wine coolers, or even a breakfast bar.

When selecting materials for your island modular kitchen, durability and style go hand in hand. Wood, granite, quartz, and high-gloss laminates are popular options that complement various design aesthetics.

The right design ensures that every inch of space is optimized without compromising the elegance of your kitchen.

One of the defining characteristics of [**Island Modular Kitchen Designs** ](https://wurfel.in/Luxury-Modular-kitchens.php)is their adaptability. They can seamlessly fit into open-concept living spaces, creating a natural flow between the kitchen, dining, and living areas.

Another advantage of modern islands is their social appeal. Cooking has become an interactive experience, and islands encourage family and friends to gather around.

This level of functionality is what sets **Best Modular Kitchens** apart from traditional setups.

Designers are constantly pushing boundaries with **Luxury Modular Kitchen** concepts. Colour palettes are evolving beyond whites and neutrals, incorporating bold shades, metallic finishes, and contrasting textures. Smart kitchens are on the rise, with integrated appliances and touch-controlled systems that enhance convenience and efficiency. Even small kitchens can benefit from island modular designs, with compact islands offering both storage and prep space without overcrowding the room.

For homeowners seeking inspiration, exploring the [**Latest Modular Kitchen trends** ](https://blogs.wurfel.in/)can provide exciting ideas.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1qh4ggp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qh4ggp,Compak K10 doser removal and doserless conversion,"I made a chute, hopper, and outfeed shelf to convert my K10 to doserless. Very pleased with the outcome, and I hope this helps others looking to do similar. 

The chute is made from a 1"" PVC 45° elbow. I used a heat gun to soften the pipe and clamped it to a wooden form forcing a stronger angle (50-55°) and squared up the end of the tube to match the K10 outlet. I then sanded the outside part of the chute to fit the small case opening of the K10 and used a Dremel to sand off a small ridge inside the chute. This mod required no cutting or drilling to the case so the doser and portafilter fork can be reattached if needed.

The chute adds virtually no coffee retention since it angles down very close to the end of the K10 outlet. Some coffee is retained in the K10 outlet but I didn't want to cut or modify the grinder irreversibly. The few grams retained in the k10 doesn't bother me since I'm typically grinding 50-350g at a time for drip coffee and cold brew. 

I made a small hopper to hold a few more beans and the thicker walls of the base prevents popcorning. I don't store coffee in wood due to flavor impact but this work well for single dosing. I also added a wooden block to cover the doser mount holes and hold a small jar hands-free while allowing a larger container to be held in place for bigger grind jobs.

It was an unexpected rush, I just felt so exhausted afterwards. For the last month, I’ve felt constant stress because I was given more tasks to do, but scheduled to be by myself some days.

I closed early to prepare yesterday for tomorrow (today). I made big list of things to do, I started stocking up when a customer walked by, she asked if we had peppermint mocha, and I nodded.

I had many mental notes before I left yesterday, one of those being, I ran out of the chocolate yesterday.

I start on the order and quickly realize I forgot we don’t have the chocolate because my main priority was that we had peppermint. This is the one time we didn’t have it, I was so used to always having it, and I immediately let her know.

“Hey, so unfortunately I hadn’t noticed we didn’t have chocolate for the peppermint, I am *so* sorry, it was an honest mistake. Would you prefer a pastry or anything from the store?”

Immediately her mood changes, her husband is standing next to her quietly, and she just raises her voice. How they just ate, she didn’t want anything, and if she could have a refund.

Which, I was told we don’t do, and it set her off further.

She wanted to speak to a manager, but the first one came in 2 hours. I apologize again, twice, and it’s starting to make me really anxious.

Immediately she starts saying it’s my fault, I profusely apologize, and I feel really bad. She starts raising her voice, I just feel so small, I mention how we can talk to one of my coworkers in the front, and I was waiting for her response when she says

“Go. You’re standing around doing nothing right now. Go get your coworker.” 

I go get him, and we can hear her telling her husband off about “how is it her fault?” I assume he was trying to tell her to calm down. He comes and she immediately blames me. The whole time she was mentioning a lot of “you messed up” and almost yelling, I bit my lip, but I couldn’t hold back the tears. My eyes watered and I turned around and softly sobbed. He took care of it and immediately took me to the back to give me space.

I just feel so little. So overwhelmed, I was telling my boyfriend how I feel like I’ve been having an autistic burnout, so this happening the next day… I just couldn’t mask anymore. I feel so drained, overwhelmed, and tiny.

So recently I (31F) realized that one of my friends (37M we’ll call him Alex) may have gone from being just a friend to kind of being a little obsessed and low key stalking me. I’ve always know he had a crush on me but he’s married and when we first met I was also married. To be clear, we were quite close so we’d talk at work about our relationships which probably wasn’t always the best idea considering I knew he had a thing for me. Before I decided to leave my ex I would complain about him to Alex and I return Alex would tell me things about his marriage that were less than perfect. From the beginning of our work friendship, Alex would bring me coffees everyday, he does this with multiple people but they have an order and he just picks up the coffees for them and they pay him at work. Alex would never accept my money. I would try and put the cash in his pocket, venmo him etc. but it was always returned with a stern “no you don’t ever pay” so eventually I stopped trying to give him money at all. When my marital problems started escalating, o wouldn’t bring dinner all the time or wouldn’t eat even if I did. So Alex noticed this and also saw I was losing weight so he started buying me food at least once a week. Once again I tried paying him and he wouldn’t accept. Over and over I tried to pay him and every time he denied me so like the coffees I just stopped trying. So Christmas comes along, and he gets me a gift that he splits with another coworker. I had no idea any of this was coming. So I in return bought them each Christmas gifts. 

This behavior continues for the next year. And eventually I leave my ex. It took a while for me to tell him because I wanted it to be just mine for a while without people fawning over the situation. Once he found out though, he was all over me “taking care of me” making sure I was ok and eating and all that. Don’t forget Alex is married with kids. So now I’m starting to feel some type of way about the situation. Now that I was single I think Alex really was able to see a future for us so he kind of latched on. People at work would make fun of him about it and he didn’t care. He eventually got transferred to a different department but would still bring me coffees. But what changed was that he would ask me to stop by his office to pick them up and I realized it was so people would see me going to see him. They started calling me his work wife which didn’t sit well with me. 

Now here is where it gets tricky. For my birthday, he wanted to take me to a restaurant it wasn’t a romantic restaurant just a casual dining Mexican place that he liked. While we were at dinner I realized what this was as he said “there’s only one person I’d cheat on my wife with but I don’t think shes into me and shes told me multiple times that she doesn’t get with married men or co workers.” This is true, I have said both of those things over and over to not just him but a lot of people at work (I work in a male dominated company). So I kind of sat there uncomfortable and said yea “probably not” and changed the subject. After the dinner he drove me back to my car and hugged me goodbye and I felt gross about the whole thing. I didn’t realize until I was in it that he was trying to use my birthday and my trust in his friendship as a way to see if I would be down to be his side chick. 

Since then it’s been non stop coffees, and candy and sodas. He would get me valentines gifts, birthday gifts and Christmas gifts. It’s been a total of 3 years 2 since the dinner. And he has just gotten more and more creepy. People would ask if we’re sleeping together and he would say “no but even if we were I wouldn’t tell you” which basically alluded to us sleeping together. He was trying to “claim” me as his at the job so no one else would try to get with me. He would take extra shifts with my department so we would be able to talk and spend time, he would legit lurk in the hallway just watching me from afar if I was talking to someone else and things like that. I’ve tried to tell him no more coffees or sodas or anything but he DOES NOT LISTEN! 

This year for my birthday he wanted to get me perfume and asked a coworker and close friend of mine what my favorite one was. My friend said “no need that’s inappropriate” and Alex said yea you’re right I won’t get her anything. But still one day when I was on my way to work Alex texted me to stop by his office to pick something up when he wasn’t there and I didn’t respond or go get it. So he left the bag on my car in the work parking lot. People saw him leave it there and said he was lurking around acting creepy about it to try and drop it off without being seen. 

The gift was to Etsy hand painted mugs, a candy bar and a soda. I lost it. I sent him a message saying his behavior was making me uncomfortable and I didn’t like the way it looked at work since people were commenting on his odd behavior so of we could stop exchanging gifts from now on” mind you I’ve only ever gotten him 1 Christmas gift 3 years ago. His response was “I understand, this place can be overwhelming. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable I’m sorry”

a few weeks ago, we tossed around the idea of getting high together sometime. so after the date on friday he asked me if i wanted to go to his house and bake pot brownies together and i can spend the night. i said yes enthusiastically, but now my anxiety is kicking in. i just got my period yesterday, so ill have to deal with that while im over his place. and since im spending the night i would’ve liked to sleep with him, im sure thats the expectation on his end as well. so i dont want to disappoint him if the expectation is that its just a hookup. he already asked his roommates if it was ok i spent the night, so i would feel awful cancelling. and on top of that, how does it reflect on my self respect by choosing to go or not based on the non-possibility of sex??

We used preground Lavazza crema e gusto classic for the first few days, then the beans arrived so we switched to Lavaza crema e gusto forte beans. (I also have Barista Intenso and Classico, haven't tried them yet).

I don't notice much a difference from preground to beans except for flavor and clearness. 

The issue that I'm having is that the coffee that it makes can barely be called an espresso, its weak, watery and when I used preground it was way too bitter. 

My grind setting is set at 3, I also tried 2.5 and now I'm at around 2. The beans dial is set to the max and I always use the single small cup option.

The thing is that we had this cheap machine before, it made the creamiest and strongest espressos I've ever had, all with preground(same as before, we rarely try new stuff). It used a porta filter thingy, so it wasn't like the magnifica S, I just know it wasn't anywhere near 300 euro.

So I'm wondering, am I trippin' or is the machine just not that good? My family and friends like the coffee...somehow, to me it seems too weak and watery, also much less crema than before.

Keep in mind I'm not a coffee nerd, all I know is that I like a good strong espresso, without getting too  nerdy about flavor or ""extraction"". So please educate me :))",2,1768829677.0,superautomatic,3,1.0,False

I’m 5'10"", I wear glasses, into swimming, volleyball, F1 and sometimes I sketch (happy to share if you're curious!). I’d like to think I’m decent looking and well definitely not camera shy. 😄

Honestly, I’m open to where this goes. A good chat, some banter, late-night convos, weekend chill sessions, maybe cuddles or more if we vibe well. No pressure. No expectations. Just someone to share energy and space with, even if it’s just virtually at first.

If we click, we can move the chat to a more private platform voice calls, deeper convos, maybe meet for a coffee or a movie binge.

Just be open minded, real, and not into ghosting. Life’s weird enough already.

And please text if you’re genuinely interested in this and in favour of putting some time and energy into getting to know each other else this is just gonna be a waste of time for both of us.

My mom encouraged me to try to sell my coffee at the restaurant but I am worrying about how others will look at my setup while selling at the standard price (such as popular cafe at my city but lower after calculating the cost and profit). Our bar is far from the place where customers eat their food. So I will not include the coffees on our menu but write it on a mini blackboard so if someone come to the bar to drink something and noticed it and want to try, I would be very happy to sell to the customer. Besides, I have a Bambino and a DF54 at home and I know that this two is for sure not suitable for commercial use. I need to bring these two to the restaurant and bring it home every day after closing time. So I tried to hint my dad about using a commercial coffee machine and grinders, but he kept saying he'll buy it in the future or brush me off. Until today, when we were having dinner and suddenly he got some opinion about the beverage, he think that selling our local coffee drinks like pakopi (I'm in Malaysia) can make even more profit as he think the beans are cheaper than arabica beans (we already have the local coffee on our menu btw, I just don't know what came up on his mind to suddenly talk about this). I can feel that he is not confident in me, selling espresso type of coffees (latte, cappuccino and so on), he thinks that we can't earn money selling it, I feel very unappreciated as I helped him to do so much things to start this restaurant, while I can't get some return (coffee machine and grinder) for the bar. I know I shouldn't be expecting something from my dad as he's contributing capital and he's the chef in the restaurant but I just feel so sad as he looks like he don't think there will be people ordering my coffees. Sigh, I'm also worried about a lot of stuff, such as people's opinion on my setup, machine overheating causing inconsistencies, and workflows.

There was this girl behind the counter, and I swear, she was among one of the most beautiful ladies I’ve ever seen😂😅.... like the kind of beauty that makes you forget your coffee order for a second.

Anyway she served me the best coffee I’ve ever had, and we exchanged a few words. I couldn’t stop thinking about her, so I went back a couple of weeks later, hoping for more coffee, but if I’m honest, mostly to see her again. But when I got there, the cafe was gone. The bookshop was still there, but when I asked the owner about the cafe, they looked at me like I was crazy and said there’d never been a cafe there.

To this day, I still think about that girl, and sometimes I wonder if she and the cafe were even real... Interesting right?? 😂😂",3,1768829092.0,unhingedKenya,1,1.0,False

1qh417a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyGear/comments/1qh417a/sometimes_less_really_is_more_wateronly_mornings/,Sometimes Less Really Is More: Water-Only Mornings,"Ever notice how complicated morning skincare has become? Cleansers, toners, serums, acids… it’s easy to get overwhelmed before your first coffee. Lately, I’ve been hearing a lot from people who just rinse with water in the morning, sometimes spritz on rose water, and swear their skin doesn’t complain.

From an expert perspective, this actually makes sense for certain skin types. If your skin isn’t oily or heavily congested, and you’re not wearing makeup or thick sunscreen overnight, water can remove sweat and surface debris without stripping natural oils. Over-cleansing in the morning, especially with harsh products, can dry out your skin and disrupt the barrier. A light moisturizer and sunscreen afterward can give you all the protection you need.

Personally, I suggest keeping a minimalist approach unless your skin really needs more. Micellar water can help if you’ve got SPF to remove, and a gentle spritz of hydrating toner or serum on damp skin can make a noticeable difference. Exfoliation can stay for evenings or a couple of times a week, not daily. I’ve seen clients who simplified their routines enjoy better hydration, fewer breakouts, and even a more natural glow.

If you’ve tried water-only mornings, what’s your experience been like? Did you notice improvement, or do you still need that full routine to feel clean?",3,1768829039.0,BeautyGear,0,1.0,False

1qh3z6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaJobs/comments/1qh3z6k/the_bottom_line_your_coworkers_are_not_your/,The Bottom Line: Your Coworkers Are Not Your Friends.,"I know this might sound a bit harsh, but let me be blunt with you: your coworkers are not your real friends. After working for about ten years in several different fields, this is a lesson I learned the hard way.  
You might go out for drinks after a long work week, vent about a difficult project, and have nice chats by the coffee machine. But as soon as someone leaves the job, 95% of these relationships evaporate. They are situational relationships, not built to last outside the office walls.  
This doesn't mean you should be a robot or rude to people. Be friendly, a good colleague, and a pleasant person to deal with. But set clear boundaries. Save your emotional energy for the people who are truly in your life and will stick with you  your real friends and your family.  
I see many people drowning in work drama because they treat it like a high school clique. It's not like that. You are there to get paid and build your career. Oversharing and getting too personal is the shortest path to getting burned, whether through office gossip or simply feeling let down.  
In general, this is my opinion. I learned this lesson after a few work besties forgot my name just one month after I left. What do you all think?",49,1768828887.0,CanadaJobs,17,0.92,False

My daughter was dying, desperate for half a million—

but my husband kicked us aside for his childhood sweetheart Lily.

Then my first love Lucas Morgan stormed in like a hero with five million.

Three months of playing daddy at her bedside. She died anyway.

Six years later, carrying Lucas's child, I catch him whispering to some doctor.

""We had to take that heart for Lily. Rebecca's got a new kid coming—she'll never figure it out.""

So my daughter wasn’t really dying—she’d been misdiagnosed.

They ripped my baby girl's heart out to save his side piece.

Cute. Real cute.

Guess what, boys? Mama's done crying.

Prepare to face the wrath of my revenge!

Hearing that, something inside me shattered.

This baby wasn't a love child—it was guilt money.

Six years playing house with Lucas Morgan while he put on the performance of a lifetime for his precious Lily.

I touched my stomach and laughed. 

Six years ago I couldn't save my daughter. Now? I'm done trying to save this mess.

Back in that office, the doctor sighed.

""Mr. Morgan, is she really worth all this? Lily's married. You've got a woman at home who worships you. Rebecca's a catch.""

Lucas didn't hesitate.

""Worth it? I don't need a ring. I just need her safe. She can love whoever she wants—long as she's alive and happy, I'm good.""

""Rebecca? Yeah, she's great. Perfect wife. Perfect mom. But I don't love her. Can't force that.""

The doctor gave up. ""Rebecca's pregnancy is high-risk. She's already lost one kid. At least try to be decent this time.""

Long pause. Then Lucas grunted something vaguely affirmative.

I bit my lip until I tasted blood, refusing to make a sound.

The second they left, I broke.

My baby girl didn't die from disease—Lucas paid doctors to kill her so Lily could have a fresh heart.

When my ex bailed to play Romeo with his childhood sweetheart, Lucas showed up playing hero.

Turns out he was just babysitting his girlfriend's stolen organ.

He married me out of guilt.

Adorable.

Outside, the sky opened up.

I didn't call a car. Just stumbled through the downpour, mascara probably streaking to my chin.

When I got home, the housekeeper nearly fainted.

""Ma'am! You're pregnant—why didn't you call the driver?""

Lucas appeared from his office, coffee in hand. Saw my swollen eyes and soaked hair. For half a second, he almost looked sorry.

Then he scooped me up.

""You're about to be a mother and you're still acting reckless. What if you'd hurt the baby?""

I stared at him, dead-eyed.

""Lucas, I've been a mother. Don't lecture me.""

""And if this one dies? Whatever. Already lost one.""

He froze mid-step. Jaw clenched. Said nothing.

Upstairs, he'd already run me a bath—perfect doting husband routine.

Reached for my clothes. I shoved his hand away.

He stared at me.

We stood there until he finally backed out.

The second the door shut, I grabbed the soap and scrubbed until my skin bu//rned raw, trying to erase every trace of him.

Six years of his fingerprints.

Time to torch it all.

By the time I got back to the bedroom, Lucas was out cold.

I stared at his face—this man I'd lived with for six years—and felt nothing but ice.

In his sleep, he grabbed my hand.

""Don't leave. Stay with me forever.""

Then he whispered it.

""Lily.""

His whole face went soft—tender in a way I'd never seen directed at me.

His phone lit up.

""Lily Princess"" flashed across the screen.

I tried unlocking it. My birthday? Nope. His birthday? Wrong. Even Lily's birthday didn't work.

One attempt left.

I punched in the day my daughter died.

Bingo.

Of course. The day Lily got her shiny new heart.

Turned out Lucas had been carrying a torch this whole time—just not for me.

I scrolled through their messages.

Photos of Lily grinning at the camera, pressed up against Lucas while he awkwardly threw up a heart sign with his hands.

""Lucas babe, amusement parks are way more fun with you than with my boring husband.""

""Don't forget—photoshoot tomorrow. You promised! Love you.""

They looked straight out of some rom-com. And me? The idi0t watching from the sidelines.

Tomorrow was supposed to be my prenatal checkup.

So. Baby or side piece?

Place your bets.

I didn't sleep that night.

I made myself a deal: if Lucas showed up for the appointment, I'd give him one last shot for the baby's sake.

Next morning, he was up early, practically whistling while he got dressed.

Right before he walked out, I grabbed his sleeve.

""Lucas. Where are you going? You promised you'd come with me today.""

His smile vanished. He thought about it way too long before patting my hand.

""Babe, I'm so sorry—something urgent came up at work. Can't make it.""

""You're always so understanding about these things. You get it, right?""

""Besides, you said it yourself yesterday—you've done this before. You'll be fine without me.""

I didn't answer.

He kissed my forehead. ""Be good. I'll bring you something nice.""

Then he was gone.

I watched him sprint out that door and felt the last thread snap.

I pulled up flights to New York. Called my best friend.

Day after tomorrow. Red-eye flight.

Once I landed, this chapter was closed.

I slapped on some makeup so I wouldn't look like a corpse and headed to the best law firm in town.

Divorce paperwork? 

Easy. The lawyer had it drafted in twenty minutes.

Nailing Lucas and Lily for murder? That needed proof.

That night, I cooked a full spread. Candles. Two bottles of Lucas's precious vintage wine.

When he walked in and saw me waiting at the table, he froze. Then smiled.

""Babe, you shouldn't be doing all this. That's what the housekeeper's for. You're supposed to relax.""

He pulled me into his arms.

We stood that close and all I could smell was cheap floral perfume—definitely not his usual cologne.

I asked when he'd started wearing tacky women's perfume.

He stiffened. Sniffed his collar. Scrambled for an excuse.

""Oh—I had a meeting with some CEO today. Must've rubbed off. Why, you jealous? Still mad I missed the appointment? I thought you'd understand.""

Guilty people always tell on themselves.

I asked one question and got a full defensive rant in return.

When I didn't respond, he switched gears. Pulled out a jewelry box. Fastened an emerald necklace around my neck.

""There. See? I got you something special. One of a kind. Only one in the world. You like it?""

The emerald caught the candlelight, glowing dark green.

Six years of marriage. Every fight ended the same way—jewelry.

As if diamonds could erase the cheating. As if gold could bring my daughter back.

Lucas smiled when I finally smiled back. Started eating.

Raved about my cooking.

Then barely touched his plate.

Hard to eat at home when you've already stuffed yourself elsewhere.

I kept pouring him wine. He drank every glass.

Twenty minutes later, he was passed out cold on the bed.

I slipped into his office.

Tore through his files looking for anything about my daughter.

Found it buried in a drawer—an organ transplant consent form from six years ago.

Lucas had signed it. As my spouse. On my behalf.

So that's why he'd rushed the wedding.

Needed legal authority to carve up my kid for his girlfriend.

I snapped photos of everything. Uploaded them along with the divorce papers into an email draft.

Set it to send automatically the second my plane took off.

By the time Lucas woke up, I'd be gone.

And he'd have nothing left but receipts.

They played me for a fool. Time to flip the board.

Next morning, Lucas woke me up.

Playing perfect husband—squeezed toothpaste onto my brush, even pretended to cook breakfast.

While I brushed my teeth, he wrapped his arms around me from behind.

""Babe, I messed up. How could I let you go to that appointment alone? Let me make it up to you today, yeah?""

Before I could answer, he ruffled my hair with that boyish grin he used to give me years ago.

Watching him fumble around the kitchen, something twisted in my heart.

Lucas. Always hot and cold.

Six years and I still couldn't read him.

Whatever. Didn't matter anymore. After today, I wouldn't have to.

We got to the hospital and guess who was there?

Lily. Getting her precious skin checked at the dermatology wing.

Being a famous actress meant she had fans swarming her like flies.

I caught bits of their chatter from across the lobby.

""Poor Lily! She barely recovered from that heart thing two years ago and now she's sick again?""

""Relax, this is the best hospital in the city. She'll be fine.""

""Plus, Lucas Morgan owns this place. He's her rumored boyfriend—total sugar daddy. He'll take care of her.""

""Ooh, actress and CEO? That's such a power couple.""

Then Lily spotted Lucas.

Screamed his name across the entire waiting room.

Everyone turned to stare.

She sprinted over and latched onto his arm like a barnacle.

""Lucas babe! This is all your fault for making me eat king crab yesterday. Now I'm covered in hives. You came to make it up to me, right? Fine, I forgive you.""

Lucas glanced at me. Then at Lily.

Then smiled at her and nodded.

The fans squealed.

I knew exactly what was coming.

I locked eyes with him and said it slow.

""Lucas. You promised you'd come with me today.""

The crowd went silent. Jaws dropped.

For half a second, Lucas looked torn. Started to move toward me.

Lily yanked him back.

Her sweet little act vanished. Now she looked at me like I was dirt.

""Lucas babe, isn't she just your housekeeper? You already drove her here—that's generous enough. No need to babysit her through some checkup.""

""People might think the baby's yours. That'd be embarrassing for someone of your status.""

The crowd's expressions flipped. Now they were looking at me like I was garbage.

Lucas opened his mouth.

Said nothing.

Lily dragged him away.

And I stood there alone in the middle of the lobby while strangers whispered and pointed.

Within an hour, some fan posted the whole scene online.

Trending in thirty minutes flat.

The comments were brutal.

""Wow, Lucas Morgan's not just rich—he's a saint. Even treats his housekeeper this well.""

""Told you Lucas would never touch garbage like that.""

""LOL this old hag's wearing a knockoff emerald necklace trying to copy Lily. Pathetic.""

""That's no knockoff—I work for the jeweler. That's our limited edition piece. Only one in the world. Lucas personally had me deliver it to Lily's place.""

""OMG he's so romantic! Everything he gives her is one-of-a-kind. Lily's living the dream.""

I closed the app.

Stared up at the operating room ceiling while the world spun.

The doctor asked me one more time.

""Miss Rebecca, are you absolutely sure about this?""

I shut my eyes. Nodded.

They pumped me full of anesthetic but I still felt it—every agonizing second.

The tears I'd been holding back finally broke through.

When it was over, I told the doctor to preserve the remains. Wait until I was gone, then hand them to Lucas Morgan.

Outside the hospital, I climbed into a cab headed for the airport.

My best friend texted me a livestream link.

Lucas was at some awards ceremony. Playing doting boyfriend to Lily.

She wore a strapless gown. He wore a matching suit.

Every time the camera cut to him, he was staring at her like she'd hung the moon.

The host teased Lily to describe their relationship in two phrases.

She blushed. Looked right at Lucas.

""Through thick and thin. Forever and always.""

I laughed out loud.

Those were the exact words Lucas had whispered to me on our wedding day.

I closed the stream. Done with both of them.

Boarding announcement crackled overhead.

One minute before I switched my phone to airplane mode, Lucas's messages started flooding in.

""Don't take what Lily said seriously. She's immature. Didn't mean it.""

""You still at the hospital? I'll come get you after this meeting, okay?""

""Babe, don't sulk. It's bad for you. Bad for the baby.""

When I didn't answer, he started calling.

I ignored every single one.

Turned my phone off.

He was still lying. Still pretending he was in some meeting when he was backstage at Lily's ceremony.

Backstage, Lucas kept checking his phone between Lily's appearances.

Finally remembered he had a pregnant wife somewhere.

Texted. Called. Nothing.

Then his assistant's message came through.

""Mr. Morgan, your wife is gone. She sent divorce papers. And... and the transplant consent form from six years ago.""",0,1768828732.0,whatsthatbook,0,0.17,False

Out of curiosity. I (30F) want to know what real moms/ first time pregnant ladies are experiencing with their partners. I feel like social media puts an unrealistic / idealistic expectation on what we should see from (particularly men) while pregnant but part of me says “that feels like bare minimum”. I get a bit resentful towards my partner (30M) sometimes because I feel like I’m stil carrying a LOT of household load while pregnant (I’m 18 weeks).

This is normal for our dynamic, I was the main house care person before pregnancy (he is military and his job days are odd/ long. I WFH 2 days a week and have a consistent 8-4 the other three) and it’s not that he WONT do it - it’s just I feel like I have to ask for a lot of it. And it’s not fair to him that I feel annoyed or bothered by his lack of initiative because I’m sure that’s more normal than what social media feeds us. So tell me - what does your partner do/ not do for you since you got pregnant or had your kid?

A little context. I am a VERY independent person and not being able to do things like lift boxes or being so tired I can’t make dinner at home really bothers me. The entire first trimester I felt like shit because I couldn’t get up to make food and care for my house/ feed the people In it. I barely got up to feed the dogs/cats. Now I have some more energy back and can do things again but I still feel like - I’m making life over here maybe I shouldn’t feel obligated to cook every night and is it too much to ask for him to cook dinner instead of saying “oh I’ll just get takeout” when he takes the initiative to figure out dinner? Anyway here’s some realistic things my partner does / doesn’t do for me since I’ve gotten pregnant because truly I feel like our dynamic hasn’t changed much at all.

\- He DOES do just about anything I ask when I ask it

\- He WILL get my craving foods (which happens very seldom). Maybe not immediately, but he tries to get it the next day or sometime that week.

\- He gets annoyed if I lift things I shouldn’t be and knows HE should be doing the heavy lifting even if before I was pregnant I would do it

\-  He takes care of the litter boxes (sometimes needing reminders) at least once a week

\- He is doing most of the big Reno work In the house that is dirty work. I typically wouldn’t help with that anyway but I still want to say it.

\- he attends my appointments if he can, even the 10 minute ones for a heartbeat check and a chat

\- if I need to cry or have pains he shows concerns and is therefor me. He Is ready to go to the doctor at the drop of a dime if I feel I need to.

\- he DOES encourage rest. Like says it’s fine if things don’t get done.

\- if I ASK for one, he will give me a massage.

\- he hasn’t shown much interest in shopping for baby. Like I asked him to find the monitor he liked and he did but..that’s as far as it’s gone. He’s indifferent about most things and trusts my judgement. It would just be nice if he came home with a little thing for baby every now and then. Would make me feel like he’s excited.

\-he doesn’t worry about my healthy habits or water intake. Like he’s a “well my mom smoked and ate junk and drank coffee/coke and I’m good.” Kindof mindset.

\- I do most of the research. He SAYS he is and I want to believe him but… he doesn’t talk about it with me. When he says “I read this” or “I looked up this” I get really excited and wish it would happen more

\- He hardly cooks dinner. He wasn’t much of the cook before - I was. But I had hoped he would take up more of that when I got pregnant. Especially first trimester. His version of getting dinner taken care of is takeout/fast food and I’m trying to get us to save money by cooking what we have.

\- He comes home and hops on his game before taking care of of any household needs. It’s annoying but I understand it (kind of). He’s military and has a long day so decompression is important but when he gets on he forgets other tasks around the house exist and I can’t stop seeing them (the floor needing sweeping, dogs needing a bath, dishes needing to be done)

\- he takes NO pictures of me while pregnant, even after I’ve asked. I didn’t look super pregnant until recently and most of my “pregnant activities “ are lazing around so I guess he feels there isn’t much to photograph but… idk it’s annoying?

\- I still do the grocery shopping (I haven’t asked him to) and get my own gas (I’m capable it would just be nice).

\- I take out the dogs without a second thought, I have to ask him.

\- I wish he was the kid of person to just make me a tea or something but alas even before pregnancy he didn’t do that much.

Anyway - that’s my little rant/ discussion starter. I’m curious how many moms to be feel the same? I know I’ll get people saying “well at least he does \_\_\_” or “at least you have someone if you need them” and to those people is at You’re Right but I still want to discuss and see / confirm that THIS is normal for those of us with supportive partners.

1qh3szq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1qh3szq/my_partner_is_not_really_different_since_i_got/,My partner is not really different since I got pregnant- and that’s ok (I think?),"So. Out of curiosity. I (30F) want to know what real moms/ first time pregnant ladies are experiencing with their partners. I feel like social media puts an unrealistic / idealistic expectation on what we should see from (particularly men) while pregnant but part of me says “that feels like bare minimum”. I get a bit resentful towards my partner (30M) sometimes because I feel like I’m stil carrying a LOT of household load while pregnant (I’m 18 weeks). 

This is normal for our dynamic, I was the main house care person before pregnancy (he is military and his job days are odd/ long. I WFH 2 days a week and have a consistent 8-4 the other three) and it’s not that he WONT do it - it’s just I feel like I have to ask for a lot of it. And it’s not fair to him that I feel annoyed or bothered by his lack of initiative because I’m sure that’s more normal than what social media feeds us. So tell me - what does your partner do/ not do for you since you got pregnant or had your kid? 

A little context. I am a **VERY** independent person and not being able to do things like lift boxes or being so tired I can’t make dinner at home really bothers me. The entire first trimester I felt like shit because I couldn’t get up to make food and care for my house/ feed the people In it. I barely got up to feed the dogs/cats. Now I have some more energy back and can do things again but I still feel like - I’m making life over here maybe I shouldn’t feel obligated to cook every night and is it too much to ask for him to cook dinner instead of saying “*oh I’ll just get takeout*” when he takes the initiative to figure out dinner? Anyway here’s some realistic things my partner does / doesn’t do for me since I’ve gotten pregnant because truly I feel like our dynamic hasn’t changed much at all.

\- He **DOES** do just about anything I ask when I ask it

\- He **WILL** get my craving foods (*which happens very seldom*). Maybe not immediately, but he tries to get it the next day or sometime that week.

\- He gets annoyed if I lift things I shouldn’t be and knows HE should be doing the heavy lifting even if before I was pregnant I would do it 

\-  He takes care of the litter boxes (*sometimes needing reminders*) at least once a week

\- He is doing most of the big Reno work In the house that is dirty work. I typically wouldn’t help with that anyway but I still want to say it.

\- he attends my appointments if he can, even the 10 minute ones for a heartbeat check and a chat

\- if I need to cry or have pains he shows concerns and is therefor me. He Is ready to go to the doctor at the drop of a dime if I feel I need to. 

\- he DOES encourage rest. Like says it’s fine if things don’t get done. 

\- if I ASK for one, he will give me a massage. 

\- he hasn’t shown much interest in shopping for baby. Like I asked him to find the monitor he liked and he did but..that’s as far as it’s gone. He’s indifferent about most things and trusts my judgement. It would just be nice if he came home with a little thing for baby every now and then. Would make me feel like he’s excited.

\-he doesn’t worry about my healthy habits or water intake. Like he’s a “*well my mom smoked and ate junk and drank coffee/coke and I’m good.*” Kindof mindset. 

\- I do most of the research. He SAYS he is and I want to believe him but… he doesn’t talk about it with me. When he says “I *read this*” or “I *looked up this*” I get really excited and wish it would happen more

\- He hardly cooks dinner. He wasn’t much of the cook before - I was. But I had hoped he would take up more of that when I got pregnant. Especially first trimester. His version of getting dinner taken care of is takeout/fast food and I’m trying to get us to save money by cooking what we have. 

\- He comes home and hops on his game before taking care of of any household needs. It’s annoying but I understand it (kind of). He’s military and has a long day so decompression is important but when he gets on he forgets other tasks around the house exist and I can’t stop seeing them (the floor needing sweeping, dogs needing a bath, dishes needing to be done) 

\- he takes NO pictures of me while pregnant, even after I’ve asked. I didn’t look super pregnant until recently and most of my “pregnant activities “ are lazing around so I guess he feels there isn’t much to photograph but… idk it’s annoying? 

\- I still do the grocery shopping (I haven’t asked him to) and get my own gas (I’m capable it would just be nice). 

\- I take out the dogs without a second thought, I have to ask him. 

\- I wish he was the kid of person to just make me a tea or something but alas even before pregnancy he didn’t do that much. 

Anyway - that’s my little rant/ discussion starter. I’m curious how many moms to be feel the same? I know I’ll get people saying “well at least he does \_\_\_” or “at least you have someone if you need them” and to those people is at **You’re Right** but I still want to discuss and see / confirm that **THIS** is normal for those of us with supportive partners. **NOT** what we see on socials that are built to make us feel bad / like our lives are not as fulfilling.

1qh3sfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1qh3sfy/the_phantom_cabinet_2_chapter_3_part_2/,The Phantom Cabinet 2: Chapter 3 (Part 2),"Sure, Carter had felt no small measure of guilt after abandoning his only child—particularly after a dishonorably discharged ex-Marine murdered Douglas in front of the Oceanside Credit Union—but his self-reproach was more than offset by the relief and relaxation he attained with a specter-free existence. Nights of lovemaking with Elaina segued to unbroken sleep. Strangers and acquaintances were far friendlier without “Ghost Boy” around. 

 

He still visited his son’s grave at Timeless Knolls Memorial Park twice a year, on Douglas’ birthday and Christmas—speaking to the corpse underfoot as if it could hear him and actually cared about the trivialities of Carter’s life—but he possessed not one photograph of Douglas, and barely remembered what he’d looked like. So too did he eschew any documentation of his time with Martha, his first wife.  

 

As with Douglas’ grave, however, he began to visit Martha from time to time. Seated at her bedside—in her cramped Milford Asylum room, with an orderly lingering in the hallway—he attempted to coax signs of awareness from the nonresponsive. 

 

Soothingly, he spoke of bygone days, the years they’d been so in love, of pancake breakfasts and formal events and snuggling on the sofa, lost in each other’s presences. Exasperated, he elaborated upon Douglas’ two deaths, demanding that she let the past go so as to heal her broken mind. Contrite, he explained his acquisition of a doctor’s certification, which attested that Martha’s mental state was unlikely to get better any time soon, which he’d use to file for a divorce. Later, he’d told Martha of his marriage to Elaina. No response. 

 

A malignancy seemed to churn, unseen, in the shadows around her. Carter’s skin crawled in Martha’s presence. Had she suddenly shrieked, he might have leapt out of it. 

 

Twice, he’d been dominated by her room’s blighted atmosphere. Seizing Martha by the shoulders, he’d shaken her. “Wake up, damn you!” he’d hollered, as her head flopped fore and aft, unresponsive, until he’d been pried away from the woman and escorted from the asylum, with threats of lost visiting privileges sounding hollowly in his ears. 

 

It had been nearly seven months since his last visit. He’d been meaning to make the drive—had made appointments in his head and skipped them, repeatedly—but was too comfortable in his suburban husband routine. The Milford Asylum experience was akin to enduring the same open-casket funeral over and over. Carter always drank a few shots of Jameson beforehand, to steel his resolve, and afterward got entirely blotto, so as to sleep. 

 

Within Martha’s withered, slack features, he saw what remained of his younger self’s naive notion of starting a family. All of Douglas’ lost potential was interred there, as was every bit of the love that Carter had felt for the two of them. 

 

If she ever emerged from her catatonia, he’d have to explain their divorce. He’d have to make Martha understand that they’d never live together again, even if she regained mental health. He’d attempt to be her friend, in some nebulous way, though the sight of her sickened him. He’d been in the delivery room when she’d throttled their newborn, after all. That memory had never slipped from his mind. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Fortunately for Carter, his days as an air conditioning engineer were long behind him. A few weeks after Douglas was laid to rest, he ridded himself of every item remaining in his unoccupied home, from the comics beneath his dead son’s bed to the bed itself, from the plantation shutters to the refrigerator—selling certain objects, giving away others, driving the rest to the landfill. 

 

While cleaning out the house, working long hours solo, Carter was astounded to find the place warm and stuffy. Neither cold spots nor winds of unknown origin conjured shivers. No phantoms capered in his peripheral vision; no mouthless voices made him revolve toward empty space. Still, he wished to be rid of the residence, as any good memories associated with it had long since been swallowed by the bad ones.

 

Selling the home for six figures had gone smoothly enough. Setting a portion of those funds aside for Elaina and his wedding—he’d yet to propose at the time, but certainly planned to—he decided to quit his job and live off of the rest. 

 

But uninvested currency is lazy currency, as many well know, and, succumbing to the preoccupation of most men, finding his days otherwise rudderless, Carter yearned for greater financial success. With neither of them working, Elaina and he often sniped at one another, and bore grudges over the most trivial matters. If he couldn’t find a solitary way to spend his time, to counterpoint those many minutes they spent together, their relationship would sour. Thus, he turned to long-distance real estate investing. 

 

Home prices being far too high in California for his liking, Carter contacted a Florida-based real estate agent, to whom he explained his intention of purchasing a home in need of light renovations, hiring a contractor to fix it up, then flipping the residence for a fast profit. He made sure to emphasize the fact that, should the agent produce a lucrative recommendation, Carter would be sure to turn to him for future property purchases. 

 

By the end of that day, not only did Carter have a half-dozen properties to choose from, complete with background info such as neighborhood crime rates and proximities to schools and shopping centers, but he had the names and phone numbers of the same number of contractors, all of whom the agent swore were bastions of integrity and cost-effectiveness. 

 

Eventually, after much hemming and hawing, Carter settled on a two-bedroom, one-bathroom Jacksonville residence for his inaugural investment. Studying photos his real estate agent emailed him, he decided that the place needed a paintjob, roof retiling, a marble backsplash in the kitchen, a new refrigerator and oven, and tile flooring to replace its cheap linoleum. He contacted the nearest three contractors for cost and time estimates, and settled on the cheapest, fastest responder. 

 

A few months later, Carter had successfully renovated and sold the place for a profit of nearly $100,000, without ever setting foot in the state of Florida. Realizing how easily he could make money without leaving his house—while wearing pajamas all day long, if he desired to—he was hooked. 

 

Initially focusing his efforts on a single house at a time, so as not to be overwhelmed, he went from city to city—Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach—selecting properties in need of light renovations, accruing profits from each. The vital repairs varied. Sometimes, doors, toilets, or cabinets needed replacing. Occasionally, lighting was the issue. When a place, otherwise rendered homeowner-friendly, still lacked a certain je ne sais quoi, he sprung for nonessential upgrades—skylights, heated flooring, accent wall stonework—to improve its wow factor and reduce its time on the market.

 

Years passed and, eventually, Carter turned his eye to Midwestern states: Ohio, Indiana and Missouri. Abhorring the idea of dealing with property managers and tenants on a regular basis, he avoided the steady stream of income that renting properties might have provided. 

 

Buy, renovate, flip…buy, renovate, flip. Profit kept inflowing; Elaina and Carter’s joint checking and savings accounts swelled. Naturally, they purchased new vehicles: a Mercedes-Benz E-Class for Carter, a BMW X5 for Elaina. Their wardrobes improved, as did Elaina’s jewelry collection. They dined out often and tipped generously. 

 

Better yet were the frequent vacations—Hawaii, New Zealand, Mallorca, Belize, Paris, Jamaica, French Polynesia and others—during which they immersed themselves in tourist attractions and off-the-beaten-track experiences.

 

Comfortable enough in Oceanside, they spoke not of relocating to a more affluent SoCal city. Instead, Carter and Elaina spent lavishly to enhance their own home. 

 

Upgrading their appliances to top-of-the-line equipment was only the beginning. A crocodile leather sofa now occupied their living room, facing an entertainment center whose pièce de résistance was an eighty-six-inch 4K television. Its sound thundered and screeched from a $4,000 wireless surround sound system. A matching TV could be found in their bedroom, which they watched from their Duxiana bed. They replaced every inch of their flooring with porcelain tiles, with electric underfloor heating keeping their feet warm at all times. They replaced their countertops with granite, and added under-cabinet lighting in the kitchen. 

 

In their backyard, they shelled out over $100,000 for an in-ground pool and jacuzzi, complete with a waterfall and breathtaking rock formations. Neither of them swam much, but they climbed into the jacuzzi at least once a week, typically with beer bottles or wine glasses in their hands. Their $10,000 American Muscle Grill evoked the 1969 Shelby GT 350 Mustang it had been modeled after.

 

Indeed, if they lacked any creature comforts, the Stantons were unaware of them. With myriad channels to choose from, hundreds of social media acquaintances, and the means to visit any location on Earth any time they desired to, rarely did they feel boredom or jealousy. Their rambunctious-but-adoring canine, a corgi named Maggie, more than made up for their lack of children, they attested. Walking her once a day inspired them to exercise.

 

Rather than succumb to the antisocial tendencies that afflict many individuals of advanced age, they maintained shallow friendships with half a dozen local couples, hosting and attending dinner parties with regularity. They were friendly with their neighbors, even babysat their children on occasion. On Halloween, they dressed in matching costumes and handed out full-size candy bars to all comers, though there were less trick-or-treaters every year. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Groaning theatrically for an audience of none, Carter eventually climbed out of bed. Soon, he’d check his email. He’d been in contact with a real estate agent in Kenton, Ohio, and the man had promised to send him documentation of properties that fit Carter’s criteria. 

 

A savvy investor, Carter wanted more than webpage bullet points and a handful of photographs to consider. In fact, he demanded a video tour of each property, shot with the agent’s cellphone, so that he might appraise the flow of the residence. He wanted to know whether knocking down a wall or adding a room would add significant value, and also which features were popular with homeowners in the area. Later, once he’d selected a probable purchase, he’d get a few contractors to inspect the place and provide him with a list of suggested repairs, along with the costs of completing them. Whichever contractor seemed the most valuable would be hired. Thus was Carter’s modus operandi. 

 

He spent time on the toilet, he shaved, and he showered. He wandered into the kitchen and manipulated his Keurig. Soon, a steamy mug of Cinnamon Dolce coffee, sweetened with pumpkin spice creamer, was his for the sipping. He carried it to the kitchen island, where Elaina awaited, drinking a similar beverage, otherwise occupied with inactivity.

 

Seating himself, sparing a moment to scratch Maggie’s head as she gamboled about his legs, he asked his wife, “So, what shall we have for breakfast? Or is it brunch time already? Eggs and toast? Bacon and waffles? Pancakes? We could go out, if you’re interested.”

 

“Oh, I don’t know,” she replied, playfully. “We both could stand to lose a few pounds. Perhaps we should skip it.”

 

“And wait until lunch or, God forbid, dinner to dine? Come back to your senses, woman. We’re not as young as we once were. We could starve to death.” He glugged down some coffee and sighed with perfect satisfaction. 

 

“Youth is a state of mind, Carter. We need to stop behaving like fogies. In fact, I’ll tell you what. I’ll fix us some breakfast, whatever you want, but only if we can go ice-skating afterwards. There’s that rink in Carlsbad. What’s it called again? Icetown?”

 

“Ice skating? Either you’re kidding or you’re some deranged doppelganger of the woman I married. I went ice-skating exactly once in my life, when I was nine, on my birthday. I slipped and smacked my head so hard I saw stars. Never again.”

 

“Oh, don’t be such a spoilsport. We’ll buy you a helmet on the way, even kneepads, if you’re so frightened.”

 

“Hey, I never said I was frightened. The word you’re looking for is ‘pragmatic.’”

 

“More like ‘prigmatic.’ Come on, it’ll be fun. If you hurt your poor little noggin, I’ll drive you to the doctor’s office. I’ll even buy you a lollypop, in fact an entire case of them, for being my brave little boy.” 

 

“Lollypop? How about anal?”

 

“You want me to peg you? Did you buy a strap-on without telling me?”

 

“That’s not what I meant. You know the kind of man you married. I’m not some…”

 

“Good-time Charlie?”

 

“Exactly. Not that I’m opposed to every type of fun, mind you.”

 

“Just any and all activities that might land you an owie?” She sniggered.

 

“Yeah, laugh it up, sugarplum. So…weren’t we talking about food? I’m growing hungrier by the moment.”

 

“Well, I could go for some eggs over easy, I guess. Maybe a little bacon.”

 

Unfortunately, Carter and Elaina’s dining was delayed by four rapid, no-nonsense thumps. Instantly alert, Maggie bounded to the front door, barking. 

 

“Are you expecting someone?” Carter asked his wife, eyebrow raised.

 

She shook her head negative.

 

Affecting a cowboy drawl, he said, “Well, I guess I better learn exactly who’s come a-knockin’.”

 

“Go get ’em, partnah.”

 

Carter ambled to the door, scooping Maggie from the floor with one arm as its opposite turned back the deadbolt. “Shh, shh,” he murmured to the corgi. “Behave, or I’ll lock you in the backyard.”

 

Opening the door, he nearly leapt out of his own flesh, nearly lost his grip on his wriggling canine. Four mirrored lenses, perhaps a foot above his eye level, reflected his agitation. Framing the aviator glasses were close-cropped, dark hairstyles and clean-shaven, square jaws. 

 

If not for their dissimilar complexions—cream and mocha, to be exact—the visitors might’ve been brothers. Each wore a dark suit, a white shirt, and a necktie. So polished were their outfits that every integrant that might catch the sunlight—their lapel pins, their tie clips, their cufflinks, even the toes of their wingtip shoes—shone most splendidly. 

 

“Mr. Carter Stanton?” said the Caucasian.

 

“I am he. And who, might I ask—”

 

“I’m Special Agent Charles Sharpe. This is Special Agent Norton Stevens.” Badges and IDs materialized, then vanished, before Carter could properly register them. “Might we come in and chat? We’ve some questions to ask, and today sure is a hot one.”

 

Carter’s stomach dropped. FBI agents at his house carried dark connotations in their pockets, he assumed. “Uh, I guess…I mean, sure, follow me,” he said.

 

Stepping over the threshold, both agents pocketed their sunglasses. Carter decided to lead them into the kitchen, where most of his mugful of coffee yet awaited. He’d need it to irrigate his suddenly far-too-dry mouth.

 

Though Carter couldn’t recall anything he’d done in years that was even slightly illegal, he was nervous all the same. “So, can I get you fellas something to drink?” he asked, keeping his tone even, unruffled. Rounding the dining room, he was pleased to find it spotless. Into the kitchen he strode.

 

The agents started to answer but were interrupted by an “Eep!” Carter had forgotten about Elaina. Though he’d dressed in jeans and an old shirt post-shower, she remained in the nightgown and panties she’d slept in. 

 

“Damn you, Carter!” she shouted, fleeing from the kitchen, toward their bedroom, a study in unbounded jiggling. The agents, to their credit, averted their eyes. 

 

“Sorry about that,” said Carter. “We slept in this morning…are still waking up, in fact.” He set Maggie on the floor. She sniffed the visitors’ ankles, and then scampered off. “Anyway, like I was asking a moment ago, are you thirsty? We have coffee, juice and soda…or something harder, if you’re of a certain disposition.” 

 

“We’re alright,” said Special Agent Stevens with weighted enunciation, swiping his hand through the air as if batting away the question. His partner didn’t seem to mind being spoken for.

 

They seated themselves around the kitchen island, with Carter reclaiming the chair he’d vacated, facing his rapidly cooling coffee, and the agents settling themselves opposite him, all the better to study his face. Sharpe’s eyes were blue; Stevens’ were hazel. Both pairs stared with an intensity that bored into Carter’s psyche. 

 

After gulping down a mouthful of coffee to fortify himself, Carter found words surging up from his throat: “So, I didn’t actually have to let you in, right? You don’t have a warrant, do you? If I don’t like your questions, I don’t have to answer them? I mean…I can call an attorney first, can’t I?” *Now I surely sound guilty*, he thought, as perspiration seeped from his face and his heartbeat accelerated. *They’ll arrest me for some serial killing I’ve never heard of, and that’ll be the end of it. The end of me.*

 

“Sure, you can go that route,” Sharpe answered. “Clam up and call a lawyer, if it makes you feel better. Tell us to leave and we’ll do exactly that. The thing is, though, Mr. Stanton, we’re not accusing *you* of anything. Like I said, we just have some questions, and then we’ll be on our way.”

 

“Oh, well, I guess that’s all right.” 

 

“Great to hear,” said Stevens, all friendly baritone. “At any rate, I’m sure that you’ve already figured out the reason for our visit.”

 

Surprised, nearly spitting out coffee before remembering to swallow it, Carter said, “Not a clue.”

 

“It’s about your ex-wife,” said Sharpe.

 

“Martha? My God, what happened? Did she finally wake up?”

 

“You mean…nobody called you?”

 

“Called me? No, I haven’t been contacted by anyone from Milford Asylum in a while. I was just there, though…half a year ago, give or take.”

 

“A definite oversight,” said Stevens. “You’re listed as her emergency contact. Somebody definitely should’ve been in touch by now.”

 

“Listen,” said Carter. “I have no idea what you’re talking about. Would one of you please explain what the hell is going on here, before my skull detonates?”

 

Ignoring his query, Sharpe asked another of his own: “So, Martha hasn’t called you, or showed up at your door?”

 

“Listen, man, the last time that I saw her, she was completely catatonic. She hasn’t walked, talked, or fed herself in years. I really have no clue what you’re getting at.”

 

“You haven’t been watching the news?” said Stevens, raising a skeptical eyebrow. “You don’t read the paper? It’s kind of a big story.”

 

“Hey, seriously, I’ve been busy. And who wants to follow the news, anyway? It’s nothing but political insanity and PC propaganda these days. Now please, for the last time, explain yourselves. The suspense is killing me.” 

 

The agents met each other’s eyes for a dilated moment, as if debating who’d be the bad news deliverer. Finally, Stevens cleared his throat, so as to say, “Well, Mr. Carter…sorry, it’s been a long day already; I meant to say Mr. Stanton. At any rate, the reason we paid you a visit is because every single person in Milford Asylum—patients, staff and visitors—was found dead, aside from Martha Drexel, your ex-wife. She disappeared from the premises, and hasn’t been seen or heard from since. There was some kind of bloodlust insanity. Everyone slaughtered each other. Corpses were piled in the dayroom.” He paused to let the info sink in. 

 

Carter’s head reeled. The kitchen’s far angles seemed to draw closer. Had he awakened from one nightmare into a worse one? It was as if hours bled out before he again summoned speech. “My God,” he said. “So, Martha was abducted?”

 

“We’re still attempting to determine that,” said Sharpe.

 

“Attempting? I’m pretty sure that the place has security cameras. I mean, doesn’t it? I remember seeing ’em there.”

 

“Correct, Mr. Stanton. There are, in fact, surveillance cameras monitoring the hallways, nurses station, and common rooms at all times…everywhere but the patients’ rooms. It’s the damnedest thing, though. Somehow, some way, for roughly forty-eight hours—a time frame that encapsulated the atrocity—those cameras recorded only green fog of indeterminable origin.”

 

“Fog? Inside the building?”

 

“We know how that sounds,” said Stevens. “But it’s entirely true, sir. At three in the morning, they all hazed over, all at once. By the time whatever was affecting them cleared up, everyone but your ex-wife was dead.”

 

“Are you sure about that?”

 

“Sure about what?” both agents asked in unison. 

 

“That Martha’s still alive. Maybe someone just stashed her corpse somewhere.”

 

“Could be,” said Stevens, absentmindedly massaging his temple, “but until we find a body, we’ll proceed as if she’s still living. Right now, we have nothing else to go on.”

 

Sharpe broke in with, “We were hoping that you’ve seen or heard from Martha. It’s too bad that you haven’t. Still, perhaps you can provide us with info of some use. Out of everyone we might talk to, you knew her the best, surely.”

 

“Her years-ago sane self, sure. But if she’s really awake now, who knows what she’s like? In the delivery room, all those years ago, she became something feral, something unrecognizable, rasping out, ‘You killed my baby,’ even as she herself strangled Douglas, our newborn son. Afterward, she retreated so deep into her own head that she never returned to me, never spoke a word or moved so much as a finger in acknowledgment of anything. If she did finally come back to herself, after all this time, is she the loving, beautiful lady I married or the madwoman, the child-killing lunatic who hardly seemed to exist on the same Earth as the rest of us?”

 

“Good point,” said Sharpe. “Still, people attempting to reconnect with society often visit old haunts. Are there any places you can think of that held special significance to Martha? Good memories or bad, just as long as they’re meaningful.”

 

“Well, there’s our old house, of course, on Calle Tranquila.”

 

“We checked it out,” said Stevens. “The family that lives there now hasn’t seen her.”

 

“Huh. In that case, how about the hospital? Oceanside Memorial Medical Center. That place has been abandoned for years, ever since the ghost incident. Nobody will buy the site. It would make a perfect hidey-hole, if Martha’s not too superstitious.”

 

Impatiently, Sharpe waved his hand. “We toured it already. Spooky, sure, but no signs of life. The security patrol we spoke with said that even skateboarders avoid the place. Imagine that.”

 

“Okay, well, we used to frequent the beach in the summertime…sometimes the pier, sometimes the harbor. Before Martha became pregnant with Douglas, when we still socialized with friends, we’d occasionally go to Brengle Terrace Park for barbecues. That’s in—”

 

“Vista, we know,” said Stevens, interrupting. “Was Martha particularly close to any of these friends of yours? Or were there any memorable fights?”

 

“No, not really. She kept all social interactions limited to boring small talk. A shy one, my Martha, definitely not into fighting. In fact, I don’t recall her ever raising her voice in anger to anyone. Even when we argued, she retained her composure.” He shook his head and muttered, “I don’t know what happened to her.”

 

“What about family? Any in the area? Was Martha close with her parents and siblings? Her cousins, perhaps?”

 

“No, Martha’s dad died years ago, and the rest of her family are East Coasters. They hardly kept in touch, save for a phone call or email every now and then. After Martha’s breakdown, they severed all ties with me. They never even met our son Douglas.”

 

“I see,” said Sharpe. He stood and sighed, as did his partner, seconds later. “Well, we appreciate you answering our questions, Mr. Stanton, though I can’t say we gained much from this conversation…unless Martha decides to show up at the beach or park sometime soon. Still, I’ll leave you with my number. If she pays you a visit or contacts you in any way, please don’t hesitate to call me.” From his wallet came a business card, upon which the golden FBI shield was printed alongside Sharpe’s phone number and email address. 

 

Carter shook their hands and accompanied the pair to the door. Watching the agents climb into a blue sedan and drive off, he was surprised to find himself shivering. *Martha, what has become of you?* he wondered. *Did you kill a bunch of people and flee the scene, or are you the victim this time? Are you even alive, or just a decoration in some serial killer’s living room?*

 

He closed the door. Swiveling on his heels, he nearly shrieked to find Elaina standing before him, now fully dressed. She’d donned a floral print dress, brushed her hair, and applied just enough makeup to give her a natural look. “Those serious-looking guys in the suits,” she demanded, “who were they?” 

 

“A couple of FBI agents,” he answered. 

 

Elaina’s eyes went wide. “What did they want? You’re not a secret serial murderer, are you? Or some kind of kiddie porn connoisseur?”

 

“Come on now, honey. I rarely leave the house without you…and you’re peeking over my shoulder half the time I’m online. I don’t have enough privacy for such activities.” 

 

“Otherwise you’d partake?”

 

“Of course not.” He took a deep breath and began to recount his conversation with the agents.",1,1768828373.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False
1qh3s4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qh3s4t/the_phantom_cabinet_2_chapter_3_part_2/,The Phantom Cabinet 2: Chapter 3 (Part 2),"Sure, Carter had felt no small measure of guilt after abandoning his only child—particularly after a dishonorably discharged ex-Marine murdered Douglas in front of the Oceanside Credit Union—but his self-reproach was more than offset by the relief and relaxation he attained with a specter-free existence. Nights of lovemaking with Elaina segued to unbroken sleep. Strangers and acquaintances were far friendlier without “Ghost Boy” around. 

 

He still visited his son’s grave at Timeless Knolls Memorial Park twice a year, on Douglas’ birthday and Christmas—speaking to the corpse underfoot as if it could hear him and actually cared about the trivialities of Carter’s life—but he possessed not one photograph of Douglas, and barely remembered what he’d looked like. So too did he eschew any documentation of his time with Martha, his first wife.  

 

As with Douglas’ grave, however, he began to visit Martha from time to time. Seated at her bedside—in her cramped Milford Asylum room, with an orderly lingering in the hallway—he attempted to coax signs of awareness from the nonresponsive. 

 

Soothingly, he spoke of bygone days, the years they’d been so in love, of pancake breakfasts and formal events and snuggling on the sofa, lost in each other’s presences. Exasperated, he elaborated upon Douglas’ two deaths, demanding that she let the past go so as to heal her broken mind. Contrite, he explained his acquisition of a doctor’s certification, which attested that Martha’s mental state was unlikely to get better any time soon, which he’d use to file for a divorce. Later, he’d told Martha of his marriage to Elaina. No response. 

 

A malignancy seemed to churn, unseen, in the shadows around her. Carter’s skin crawled in Martha’s presence. Had she suddenly shrieked, he might have leapt out of it. 

 

Twice, he’d been dominated by her room’s blighted atmosphere. Seizing Martha by the shoulders, he’d shaken her. “Wake up, damn you!” he’d hollered, as her head flopped fore and aft, unresponsive, until he’d been pried away from the woman and escorted from the asylum, with threats of lost visiting privileges sounding hollowly in his ears. 

 

It had been nearly seven months since his last visit. He’d been meaning to make the drive—had made appointments in his head and skipped them, repeatedly—but was too comfortable in his suburban husband routine. The Milford Asylum experience was akin to enduring the same open-casket funeral over and over. Carter always drank a few shots of Jameson beforehand, to steel his resolve, and afterward got entirely blotto, so as to sleep. 

 

Within Martha’s withered, slack features, he saw what remained of his younger self’s naive notion of starting a family. All of Douglas’ lost potential was interred there, as was every bit of the love that Carter had felt for the two of them. 

 

If she ever emerged from her catatonia, he’d have to explain their divorce. He’d have to make Martha understand that they’d never live together again, even if she regained mental health. He’d attempt to be her friend, in some nebulous way, though the sight of her sickened him. He’d been in the delivery room when she’d throttled their newborn, after all. That memory had never slipped from his mind. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Fortunately for Carter, his days as an air conditioning engineer were long behind him. A few weeks after Douglas was laid to rest, he ridded himself of every item remaining in his unoccupied home, from the comics beneath his dead son’s bed to the bed itself, from the plantation shutters to the refrigerator—selling certain objects, giving away others, driving the rest to the landfill. 

 

While cleaning out the house, working long hours solo, Carter was astounded to find the place warm and stuffy. Neither cold spots nor winds of unknown origin conjured shivers. No phantoms capered in his peripheral vision; no mouthless voices made him revolve toward empty space. Still, he wished to be rid of the residence, as any good memories associated with it had long since been swallowed by the bad ones.

 

Selling the home for six figures had gone smoothly enough. Setting a portion of those funds aside for Elaina and his wedding—he’d yet to propose at the time, but certainly planned to—he decided to quit his job and live off of the rest. 

 

But uninvested currency is lazy currency, as many well know, and, succumbing to the preoccupation of most men, finding his days otherwise rudderless, Carter yearned for greater financial success. With neither of them working, Elaina and he often sniped at one another, and bore grudges over the most trivial matters. If he couldn’t find a solitary way to spend his time, to counterpoint those many minutes they spent together, their relationship would sour. Thus, he turned to long-distance real estate investing. 

 

Home prices being far too high in California for his liking, Carter contacted a Florida-based real estate agent, to whom he explained his intention of purchasing a home in need of light renovations, hiring a contractor to fix it up, then flipping the residence for a fast profit. He made sure to emphasize the fact that, should the agent produce a lucrative recommendation, Carter would be sure to turn to him for future property purchases. 

 

By the end of that day, not only did Carter have a half-dozen properties to choose from, complete with background info such as neighborhood crime rates and proximities to schools and shopping centers, but he had the names and phone numbers of the same number of contractors, all of whom the agent swore were bastions of integrity and cost-effectiveness. 

 

Eventually, after much hemming and hawing, Carter settled on a two-bedroom, one-bathroom Jacksonville residence for his inaugural investment. Studying photos his real estate agent emailed him, he decided that the place needed a paintjob, roof retiling, a marble backsplash in the kitchen, a new refrigerator and oven, and tile flooring to replace its cheap linoleum. He contacted the nearest three contractors for cost and time estimates, and settled on the cheapest, fastest responder. 

 

A few months later, Carter had successfully renovated and sold the place for a profit of nearly $100,000, without ever setting foot in the state of Florida. Realizing how easily he could make money without leaving his house—while wearing pajamas all day long, if he desired to—he was hooked. 

 

Initially focusing his efforts on a single house at a time, so as not to be overwhelmed, he went from city to city—Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach—selecting properties in need of light renovations, accruing profits from each. The vital repairs varied. Sometimes, doors, toilets, or cabinets needed replacing. Occasionally, lighting was the issue. When a place, otherwise rendered homeowner-friendly, still lacked a certain je ne sais quoi, he sprung for nonessential upgrades—skylights, heated flooring, accent wall stonework—to improve its wow factor and reduce its time on the market.

 

Years passed and, eventually, Carter turned his eye to Midwestern states: Ohio, Indiana and Missouri. Abhorring the idea of dealing with property managers and tenants on a regular basis, he avoided the steady stream of income that renting properties might have provided. 

 

Buy, renovate, flip…buy, renovate, flip. Profit kept inflowing; Elaina and Carter’s joint checking and savings accounts swelled. Naturally, they purchased new vehicles: a Mercedes-Benz E-Class for Carter, a BMW X5 for Elaina. Their wardrobes improved, as did Elaina’s jewelry collection. They dined out often and tipped generously. 

 

Better yet were the frequent vacations—Hawaii, New Zealand, Mallorca, Belize, Paris, Jamaica, French Polynesia and others—during which they immersed themselves in tourist attractions and off-the-beaten-track experiences.

 

Comfortable enough in Oceanside, they spoke not of relocating to a more affluent SoCal city. Instead, Carter and Elaina spent lavishly to enhance their own home. 

 

Upgrading their appliances to top-of-the-line equipment was only the beginning. A crocodile leather sofa now occupied their living room, facing an entertainment center whose pièce de résistance was an eighty-six-inch 4K television. Its sound thundered and screeched from a $4,000 wireless surround sound system. A matching TV could be found in their bedroom, which they watched from their Duxiana bed. They replaced every inch of their flooring with porcelain tiles, with electric underfloor heating keeping their feet warm at all times. They replaced their countertops with granite, and added under-cabinet lighting in the kitchen. 

 

In their backyard, they shelled out over $100,000 for an in-ground pool and jacuzzi, complete with a waterfall and breathtaking rock formations. Neither of them swam much, but they climbed into the jacuzzi at least once a week, typically with beer bottles or wine glasses in their hands. Their $10,000 American Muscle Grill evoked the 1969 Shelby GT 350 Mustang it had been modeled after.

 

Indeed, if they lacked any creature comforts, the Stantons were unaware of them. With myriad channels to choose from, hundreds of social media acquaintances, and the means to visit any location on Earth any time they desired to, rarely did they feel boredom or jealousy. Their rambunctious-but-adoring canine, a corgi named Maggie, more than made up for their lack of children, they attested. Walking her once a day inspired them to exercise.

 

Rather than succumb to the antisocial tendencies that afflict many individuals of advanced age, they maintained shallow friendships with half a dozen local couples, hosting and attending dinner parties with regularity. They were friendly with their neighbors, even babysat their children on occasion. On Halloween, they dressed in matching costumes and handed out full-size candy bars to all comers, though there were less trick-or-treaters every year. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Groaning theatrically for an audience of none, Carter eventually climbed out of bed. Soon, he’d check his email. He’d been in contact with a real estate agent in Kenton, Ohio, and the man had promised to send him documentation of properties that fit Carter’s criteria. 

 

A savvy investor, Carter wanted more than webpage bullet points and a handful of photographs to consider. In fact, he demanded a video tour of each property, shot with the agent’s cellphone, so that he might appraise the flow of the residence. He wanted to know whether knocking down a wall or adding a room would add significant value, and also which features were popular with homeowners in the area. Later, once he’d selected a probable purchase, he’d get a few contractors to inspect the place and provide him with a list of suggested repairs, along with the costs of completing them. Whichever contractor seemed the most valuable would be hired. Thus was Carter’s modus operandi. 

 

He spent time on the toilet, he shaved, and he showered. He wandered into the kitchen and manipulated his Keurig. Soon, a steamy mug of Cinnamon Dolce coffee, sweetened with pumpkin spice creamer, was his for the sipping. He carried it to the kitchen island, where Elaina awaited, drinking a similar beverage, otherwise occupied with inactivity.

 

Seating himself, sparing a moment to scratch Maggie’s head as she gamboled about his legs, he asked his wife, “So, what shall we have for breakfast? Or is it brunch time already? Eggs and toast? Bacon and waffles? Pancakes? We could go out, if you’re interested.”

 

“Oh, I don’t know,” she replied, playfully. “We both could stand to lose a few pounds. Perhaps we should skip it.”

 

“And wait until lunch or, God forbid, dinner to dine? Come back to your senses, woman. We’re not as young as we once were. We could starve to death.” He glugged down some coffee and sighed with perfect satisfaction. 

 

“Youth is a state of mind, Carter. We need to stop behaving like fogies. In fact, I’ll tell you what. I’ll fix us some breakfast, whatever you want, but only if we can go ice-skating afterwards. There’s that rink in Carlsbad. What’s it called again? Icetown?”

 

“Ice skating? Either you’re kidding or you’re some deranged doppelganger of the woman I married. I went ice-skating exactly once in my life, when I was nine, on my birthday. I slipped and smacked my head so hard I saw stars. Never again.”

 

“Oh, don’t be such a spoilsport. We’ll buy you a helmet on the way, even kneepads, if you’re so frightened.”

 

“Hey, I never said I was frightened. The word you’re looking for is ‘pragmatic.’”

 

“More like ‘prigmatic.’ Come on, it’ll be fun. If you hurt your poor little noggin, I’ll drive you to the doctor’s office. I’ll even buy you a lollypop, in fact an entire case of them, for being my brave little boy.” 

 

“Lollypop? How about anal?”

 

“You want me to peg you? Did you buy a strap-on without telling me?”

 

“That’s not what I meant. You know the kind of man you married. I’m not some…”

 

“Good-time Charlie?”

 

“Exactly. Not that I’m opposed to every type of fun, mind you.”

 

“Just any and all activities that might land you an owie?” She sniggered.

 

“Yeah, laugh it up, sugarplum. So…weren’t we talking about food? I’m growing hungrier by the moment.”

 

“Well, I could go for some eggs over easy, I guess. Maybe a little bacon.”

 

Unfortunately, Carter and Elaina’s dining was delayed by four rapid, no-nonsense thumps. Instantly alert, Maggie bounded to the front door, barking. 

 

“Are you expecting someone?” Carter asked his wife, eyebrow raised.

 

She shook her head negative.

 

Affecting a cowboy drawl, he said, “Well, I guess I better learn exactly who’s come a-knockin’.”

 

“Go get ’em, partnah.”

 

Carter ambled to the door, scooping Maggie from the floor with one arm as its opposite turned back the deadbolt. “Shh, shh,” he murmured to the corgi. “Behave, or I’ll lock you in the backyard.”

 

Opening the door, he nearly leapt out of his own flesh, nearly lost his grip on his wriggling canine. Four mirrored lenses, perhaps a foot above his eye level, reflected his agitation. Framing the aviator glasses were close-cropped, dark hairstyles and clean-shaven, square jaws. 

 

If not for their dissimilar complexions—cream and mocha, to be exact—the visitors might’ve been brothers. Each wore a dark suit, a white shirt, and a necktie. So polished were their outfits that every integrant that might catch the sunlight—their lapel pins, their tie clips, their cufflinks, even the toes of their wingtip shoes—shone most splendidly. 

 

“Mr. Carter Stanton?” said the Caucasian.

 

“I am he. And who, might I ask—”

 

“I’m Special Agent Charles Sharpe. This is Special Agent Norton Stevens.” Badges and IDs materialized, then vanished, before Carter could properly register them. “Might we come in and chat? We’ve some questions to ask, and today sure is a hot one.”

 

Carter’s stomach dropped. FBI agents at his house carried dark connotations in their pockets, he assumed. “Uh, I guess…I mean, sure, follow me,” he said.

 

Stepping over the threshold, both agents pocketed their sunglasses. Carter decided to lead them into the kitchen, where most of his mugful of coffee yet awaited. He’d need it to irrigate his suddenly far-too-dry mouth.

 

Though Carter couldn’t recall anything he’d done in years that was even slightly illegal, he was nervous all the same. “So, can I get you fellas something to drink?” he asked, keeping his tone even, unruffled. Rounding the dining room, he was pleased to find it spotless. Into the kitchen he strode.

 

The agents started to answer but were interrupted by an “Eep!” Carter had forgotten about Elaina. Though he’d dressed in jeans and an old shirt post-shower, she remained in the nightgown and panties she’d slept in. 

 

“Damn you, Carter!” she shouted, fleeing from the kitchen, toward their bedroom, a study in unbounded jiggling. The agents, to their credit, averted their eyes. 

 

“Sorry about that,” said Carter. “We slept in this morning…are still waking up, in fact.” He set Maggie on the floor. She sniffed the visitors’ ankles, and then scampered off. “Anyway, like I was asking a moment ago, are you thirsty? We have coffee, juice and soda…or something harder, if you’re of a certain disposition.” 

 

“We’re alright,” said Special Agent Stevens with weighted enunciation, swiping his hand through the air as if batting away the question. His partner didn’t seem to mind being spoken for.

 

They seated themselves around the kitchen island, with Carter reclaiming the chair he’d vacated, facing his rapidly cooling coffee, and the agents settling themselves opposite him, all the better to study his face. Sharpe’s eyes were blue; Stevens’ were hazel. Both pairs stared with an intensity that bored into Carter’s psyche. 

 

After gulping down a mouthful of coffee to fortify himself, Carter found words surging up from his throat: “So, I didn’t actually have to let you in, right? You don’t have a warrant, do you? If I don’t like your questions, I don’t have to answer them? I mean…I can call an attorney first, can’t I?” *Now I surely sound guilty*, he thought, as perspiration seeped from his face and his heartbeat accelerated. *They’ll arrest me for some serial killing I’ve never heard of, and that’ll be the end of it. The end of me.*

 

“Sure, you can go that route,” Sharpe answered. “Clam up and call a lawyer, if it makes you feel better. Tell us to leave and we’ll do exactly that. The thing is, though, Mr. Stanton, we’re not accusing *you* of anything. Like I said, we just have some questions, and then we’ll be on our way.”

 

“Oh, well, I guess that’s all right.” 

 

“Great to hear,” said Stevens, all friendly baritone. “At any rate, I’m sure that you’ve already figured out the reason for our visit.”

 

Surprised, nearly spitting out coffee before remembering to swallow it, Carter said, “Not a clue.”

 

“It’s about your ex-wife,” said Sharpe.

 

“Martha? My God, what happened? Did she finally wake up?”

 

“You mean…nobody called you?”

 

“Called me? No, I haven’t been contacted by anyone from Milford Asylum in a while. I was just there, though…half a year ago, give or take.”

 

“A definite oversight,” said Stevens. “You’re listed as her emergency contact. Somebody definitely should’ve been in touch by now.”

 

“Listen,” said Carter. “I have no idea what you’re talking about. Would one of you please explain what the hell is going on here, before my skull detonates?”

 

Ignoring his query, Sharpe asked another of his own: “So, Martha hasn’t called you, or showed up at your door?”

 

“Listen, man, the last time that I saw her, she was completely catatonic. She hasn’t walked, talked, or fed herself in years. I really have no clue what you’re getting at.”

 

“You haven’t been watching the news?” said Stevens, raising a skeptical eyebrow. “You don’t read the paper? It’s kind of a big story.”

 

“Hey, seriously, I’ve been busy. And who wants to follow the news, anyway? It’s nothing but political insanity and PC propaganda these days. Now please, for the last time, explain yourselves. The suspense is killing me.” 

 

The agents met each other’s eyes for a dilated moment, as if debating who’d be the bad news deliverer. Finally, Stevens cleared his throat, so as to say, “Well, Mr. Carter…sorry, it’s been a long day already; I meant to say Mr. Stanton. At any rate, the reason we paid you a visit is because every single person in Milford Asylum—patients, staff and visitors—was found dead, aside from Martha Drexel, your ex-wife. She disappeared from the premises, and hasn’t been seen or heard from since. There was some kind of bloodlust insanity. Everyone slaughtered each other. Corpses were piled in the dayroom.” He paused to let the info sink in. 

 

Carter’s head reeled. The kitchen’s far angles seemed to draw closer. Had he awakened from one nightmare into a worse one? It was as if hours bled out before he again summoned speech. “My God,” he said. “So, Martha was abducted?”

 

“We’re still attempting to determine that,” said Sharpe.

 

“Attempting? I’m pretty sure that the place has security cameras. I mean, doesn’t it? I remember seeing ’em there.”

 

“Correct, Mr. Stanton. There are, in fact, surveillance cameras monitoring the hallways, nurses station, and common rooms at all times…everywhere but the patients’ rooms. It’s the damnedest thing, though. Somehow, some way, for roughly forty-eight hours—a time frame that encapsulated the atrocity—those cameras recorded only green fog of indeterminable origin.”

 

“Fog? Inside the building?”

 

“We know how that sounds,” said Stevens. “But it’s entirely true, sir. At three in the morning, they all hazed over, all at once. By the time whatever was affecting them cleared up, everyone but your ex-wife was dead.”

 

“Are you sure about that?”

 

“Sure about what?” both agents asked in unison. 

 

“That Martha’s still alive. Maybe someone just stashed her corpse somewhere.”

 

“Could be,” said Stevens, absentmindedly massaging his temple, “but until we find a body, we’ll proceed as if she’s still living. Right now, we have nothing else to go on.”

 

Sharpe broke in with, “We were hoping that you’ve seen or heard from Martha. It’s too bad that you haven’t. Still, perhaps you can provide us with info of some use. Out of everyone we might talk to, you knew her the best, surely.”

 

“Her years-ago sane self, sure. But if she’s really awake now, who knows what she’s like? In the delivery room, all those years ago, she became something feral, something unrecognizable, rasping out, ‘You killed my baby,’ even as she herself strangled Douglas, our newborn son. Afterward, she retreated so deep into her own head that she never returned to me, never spoke a word or moved so much as a finger in acknowledgment of anything. If she did finally come back to herself, after all this time, is she the loving, beautiful lady I married or the madwoman, the child-killing lunatic who hardly seemed to exist on the same Earth as the rest of us?”

 

“Good point,” said Sharpe. “Still, people attempting to reconnect with society often visit old haunts. Are there any places you can think of that held special significance to Martha? Good memories or bad, just as long as they’re meaningful.”

 

“Well, there’s our old house, of course, on Calle Tranquila.”

 

“We checked it out,” said Stevens. “The family that lives there now hasn’t seen her.”

 

“Huh. In that case, how about the hospital? Oceanside Memorial Medical Center. That place has been abandoned for years, ever since the ghost incident. Nobody will buy the site. It would make a perfect hidey-hole, if Martha’s not too superstitious.”

 

Impatiently, Sharpe waved his hand. “We toured it already. Spooky, sure, but no signs of life. The security patrol we spoke with said that even skateboarders avoid the place. Imagine that.”

 

“Okay, well, we used to frequent the beach in the summertime…sometimes the pier, sometimes the harbor. Before Martha became pregnant with Douglas, when we still socialized with friends, we’d occasionally go to Brengle Terrace Park for barbecues. That’s in—”

 

“Vista, we know,” said Stevens, interrupting. “Was Martha particularly close to any of these friends of yours? Or were there any memorable fights?”

 

“No, not really. She kept all social interactions limited to boring small talk. A shy one, my Martha, definitely not into fighting. In fact, I don’t recall her ever raising her voice in anger to anyone. Even when we argued, she retained her composure.” He shook his head and muttered, “I don’t know what happened to her.”

 

“What about family? Any in the area? Was Martha close with her parents and siblings? Her cousins, perhaps?”

 

“No, Martha’s dad died years ago, and the rest of her family are East Coasters. They hardly kept in touch, save for a phone call or email every now and then. After Martha’s breakdown, they severed all ties with me. They never even met our son Douglas.”

 

“I see,” said Sharpe. He stood and sighed, as did his partner, seconds later. “Well, we appreciate you answering our questions, Mr. Stanton, though I can’t say we gained much from this conversation…unless Martha decides to show up at the beach or park sometime soon. Still, I’ll leave you with my number. If she pays you a visit or contacts you in any way, please don’t hesitate to call me.” From his wallet came a business card, upon which the golden FBI shield was printed alongside Sharpe’s phone number and email address. 

 

Carter shook their hands and accompanied the pair to the door. Watching the agents climb into a blue sedan and drive off, he was surprised to find himself shivering. *Martha, what has become of you?* he wondered. *Did you kill a bunch of people and flee the scene, or are you the victim this time? Are you even alive, or just a decoration in some serial killer’s living room?*

 

He closed the door. Swiveling on his heels, he nearly shrieked to find Elaina standing before him, now fully dressed. She’d donned a floral print dress, brushed her hair, and applied just enough makeup to give her a natural look. “Those serious-looking guys in the suits,” she demanded, “who were they?” 

 

“A couple of FBI agents,” he answered. 

 

Elaina’s eyes went wide. “What did they want? You’re not a secret serial murderer, are you? Or some kind of kiddie porn connoisseur?”

 

“Come on now, honey. I rarely leave the house without you…and you’re peeking over my shoulder half the time I’m online. I don’t have enough privacy for such activities.” 

 

“Otherwise you’d partake?”

 

“Of course not.” He took a deep breath and began to recount his conversation with the agents.",1,1768828348.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

- **Durable Materials:** Barndominiums are usually built with robust materials, ensuring longevity and lower maintenance needs.
- **Flexibility:** Regardless of your lifestyle, barndominiums can be adapted or extended as needs change.

Compact barndominium floor plans present modern homeowners with innovative and efficient living ideas. Featuring multifunctional spaces and stylish design elements, these homes create welcoming environments while ensuring that every square foot is utilized effectively. If you’re considering a space-efficient option for your next home, a barndominium could be the ideal solution for a contemporary lifestyle.

Maximizing Space: Efficient Small Home Ideas for Optimal Functionality
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In today's fast-paced world, many individuals and families are searching for efficient small home ideas that maximize space without sacrificing comfort or functionality. Compact living spaces, like barndominiums, are gaining popularity as they represent innovative solutions for living with purpose. Here are some strategies to enhance your small home experience while ensuring optimal functionality.

### Smart Layouts

When designing compact spaces, the layout becomes crucial. Emphasizing an open floor plan can create an inviting atmosphere visually. Here are some tips:

- **Open Spaces:** Consider removing unnecessary walls to create a seamless flow between the kitchen, living, and dining areas. This approach not only expands the perception of space but also enhances natural light.
- **Multi-purpose Rooms:** Reserve rooms for versatile uses. For example, a guest room can double as an office, and a dining area can be used for crafting or studying.
- **Vertical Space:** Utilize vertical designs in floor plans, allowing for higher ceilings and loft areas. This clever use of height can free up foundational space for extra amenities.

### Furniture Selection

Choosing the right furniture is essential for compact living. Here’s how to pick pieces that fit your vision:

- **Scaled Furniture:** Opt for smaller-scale furniture that provides comfort without overwhelming the space. Look for items with sleek designs that fit proportionately.
- **Storage Solutions:** Invest in furniture that doubles as storage. Ottomans with compartments, coffee tables with drawers, and bed frames with built-in storage can keep your living area clutter-free.
- **Foldable Options:** Consider collapsible or extendable furniture. Dining tables that expand for gatherings and collapsible chairs can be a boon for hosting.

### Lighting Considerations

Effective lighting can dramatically alter the perception of space. Here are some lighting strategies for compact homes:

- **Natural Light:** Maximize windows and consider adding skylights. Natural light can make spaces feel larger and more inviting.
- **Layered Lighting:** Utilize a combination of ambient, task, and accent lighting. Floor lamps and wall sconces can add warmth and depth without occupying valuable floor space.
- **Mirrors:** Strategically placing mirrors creates an illusion of depth and height, reflecting light and making the space feel more open.

### Color and Décor

The color palette you select plays a significant role in how your small space feels. Here are actionable tips:

- **Light Colors:** Employ light shades on walls, like pastel or neutral tones. These colors reflect light and help create a spacious feeling.
- **Accent Walls:** Incorporate one darker or bolder color for an accent wall. This adds interest without overwhelming the layout.
- **Minimalist Décor:** Opt for a minimalist approach to décor. Keep surfaces clear, and showcase a few well-chosen pieces of art or personal items.

### Outdoor Integration

For compact homes, your outdoor space can expand your living area. Consider integrating the outdoors into your living plans:

- **Patios or Decks:** Use outdoor spaces for relaxation or social gatherings, adding furniture for seating that doesn't take up interior space.
- **Garden Areas:** Incorporate vertical gardens or potted plants that can enhance beauty without requiring significant ground space.
- **Sliding Glass Doors:** Install large sliding doors that seamlessly link your indoor space with the outdoors, encouraging a natural flow between the two environments.

Embracing efficient small home ideas can transform your compact living space into a functional, beautiful oasis. By focusing on smart layouts, thoughtful furniture choices, optimal lighting, reflective colors, and integrating outdoor spaces, you can enhance both the comfort and utility of your home. It’s all about creating a space that suits your lifestyle while maximizing every square foot.

### Conclusion

Crafting the perfect compact barndominium floor plan is all about innovation and efficiency. As we've explored, barndominiums offer a unique blend of rustic charm and modern living, allowing you to embrace open spaces while maintaining functional design. Whether you’re considering a small footprint or planning multi-functional areas, these innovative floor plans cater to diverse lifestyles.

Maximizing space is crucial in today’s homes, especially when every square foot counts. Embracing efficient small home ideas ensures you create a cozy environment without sacrificing comfort. Thoughtful design elements, such as built-in furniture and multipurpose rooms, can transform tiny spaces into inviting havens. Each design decision should resonate with your personal style, whether that means integrating clever storage solutions or utilizing vertical space effectively.

The concept of a barndominium goes beyond just a floor plan—it’s a lifestyle choice that embodies simplicity and practicality. With the right approach, you can create a space that fosters connection, creativity, and a sense of belonging. From the open-concept layouts to the clever use of natural light, the potential for creating an efficient yet stylish home is limitless.

As you embark on your journey towards building or renovating a compact barndominium, keep these ideas at the forefront. They not only provide insight into maximizing your living space but also highlight the beauty of simplicity in modern design. By infusing your personality into every detail, you can create a barndominium that feels uniquely yours while being perfectly suited for contemporary living. Embrace the possibilities and let your home reflect both your needs and aspirations.",1,1768828328.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

1qh3ppc,https://www.reddit.com/r/notioncreations/comments/1qh3ppc/ive_built_11_notion_systems_healthos_came_from/,"I've built 11 Notion systems. HealthOS came from being tired of ""just eat better"" advice.","I have been building Notion systems for about a year. WritersOS, PoetryOS, PolymathOS, 11 products, around $500 in sales. Most solved organization problems for creative or business work.

Then I got diagnosed with asthma in July after months of being told to ""eat better, reduce stress, maybe try yoga.""

The advice wasn't wrong. It was just useless without data.

**The actual problem:**

Chronic illness management has a data problem. Doctors ask you to notice patterns and track triggers, but they don't give you frameworks to do it systematically.

Which foods? What kind of stress? Is the medication actually working or am I placeholding?

Most health apps are event logs: symptom happens → record it → close app. No connections. No pattern recognition. Just a list of isolated incidents that don't reveal anything.

I'd show up to appointments with vague feelings instead of clear data. Doctor asks ""any patterns?"" and I'm guessing based on whatever I happened to remember that morning.

**What I learned from building 10 other systems:**

Health isn't isolated events. It's interconnected variables.

Your diet affects symptoms. Stress impacts medication effectiveness. Sleep influences pain levels. Insurance coverage determines treatment options. They all interact, but nothing connects them.

After building systems for writing, learning, and business, I knew the solution wasn't more tracking. It was better architecture.

**Design principle: Single source of truth for diagnoses, everything else is relations and rollups.**

Not ""I feel bad today.""

""I feel bad → connected to what I ate → linked to current medications → tagged with stress level → associated with my asthma diagnosis → pattern detection runs automatically.""

10 modules, 28 interconnected databases:

* Diagnosis Hub (single source of truth)
* Symptom Tracker (relations to diet, meds, stress)
* Medication Log (linked to symptoms and side effects)
* Diet & Nutrition (actual trigger correlation analysis)
* Appointments (rollups pull all relevant prep data)
* Exercise, Mental Health, Insurance/Costs, Goals, Support Network

**The intelligence layer:**

When I log a symptom, it auto-connects to:

* Current medications
* Recent meals
* Stress/mood data
* Diagnosis timeline

When someone says ""eat better,"" I can filter:

* Foods consumed on high vs. low symptom days
* Statistical correlations (dairy increases chest tightness 60% of the time)
* Whether elimination actually changed outcomes

When prepping for appointments:

* Symptom frequency over 30 days (rollup)
* Medication adherence rate (formula)
* Changes since last visit (filtered view)
* Cost breakdown (for insurance discussions)

The system computes insights from data instead of just storing entries.

**What this taught me that 9 previous builds didn't:**

**Low-energy design matters more than I thought.** When you can barely function, logging can't require cognitive load. Quick-add templates became essential, not optional.

**Time-series reveals what memory hides.** Weekly rollups showed my symptoms spiked every Thursday (deadline stress correlation). Monthly views caught dairy patterns I'd never have noticed day-to-day.

**Data changes medical conversations.** ""I think it's getting worse"" gets dismissed. ""Symptom frequency increased 40% over 6 weeks despite 95% adherence"" starts a diagnostic discussion. The tone shift was immediate.

**Financial data belongs in the health model.** Insurance coverage directly affects treatment decisions. Separating costs from clinical data creates an incomplete picture.

**Technical approach:**

Relations form the diagnostic backbone:

* Symptoms → Diagnoses → Treatments → Outcomes
* Diet → Triggers → Pattern flags
* Medication → Side Effects → Continuation signals
* Appointments → Instructions → Task completion

Missing one relation means missing one pattern. The architecture needs to be complete, not just functional.

Built entirely with Notion-native features (relations, rollups, formulas). Works on free tier.

**Why I'm sharing this:**

Most health tracking in Notion is either simple logs or dashboards with no underlying intelligence.

After 9 template launches, this is the first one where the architecture had to answer real diagnostic questions, not just organize information.

If you're building health systems in Notion, curious how you approached it. Did you connect everything or keep modules separate? How did you handle low-energy tracking?

1qh3n62,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1qh3n62/longterm_fearbased_breakup_with_avoidant_partner/,"Long-term, fear-based breakup with avoidant partner – am I misreading the signals or just stuck in limbo?","Hi everyone,

I’m looking for grounded, honest perspectives rather than motivational or “no contact works!” type advice.

I (M) was in a 3.5-year relationship with my ex (F). It was genuinely loving, emotionally close, and secure for most of its duration. We were best friends, no cheating, no abuse, no loss of attraction. A month before the breakup she was in tears telling me how deeply she loved me.

The breakup itself was fear-based. She said:

	•	She couldn’t see a future anymore

	•	She was scared about the distance / life pressures

	•	She felt like she was losing her best friend

	•	I’d been an amazing boyfriend

	•	She’d always love me

	•	She expressed regret during the conversation and kept wavering emotionally while breaking up

She works as a cancer ward nurse and has been under extreme emotional strain. Her family life is also very chaotic. She tends to avoid emotional confrontation and shuts down when overwhelmed (likely avoidant or fearful-avoidant).

At the breakup I didn’t beg or fight; I stayed composed even though I was devastated. A few weeks later (week 3), she reached out with a very warm congratulatory message after I completed a marathon, telling me she was proud of me and happy for me. At week 5, I asked her for coffee and she said it was too early and she didn’t want to make things harder. I replied respectfully and didn’t push.

Since then (now \~10 weeks post breakup):

	•	No contact from either side

	•	She hasn’t unfollowed my close friends or my disabled brother’s account

	•	She still has our photos on Instagram

	•	She hasn’t publicly erased me from her life

	•	She hasn’t villainized me or reframed the relationship negatively

	•	But there’s been total silence otherwise

On my side, I’ve:

	•	Travelled

	•	Run a marathon

	•	Grown my business significantly

	•	Been in somatic therapy weekly

	•	Worked on my anxious attachment

	•	Journaled and reflected deeply

	•	Stayed fully no contact

	•	Not chased, begged, or used mutual friends

Emotionally I’m wrecked. I still love her deeply. I don’t want someone new. I want her. But the silence is destroying me and I’m stuck in this suspended limbo where nothing is resolved.

The confusing part:

On one hand:

	•	She expressed regret during the breakup

	•	She reached out warmly after my marathon

	•	She hasn’t erased me socially

	•	She expressed love and grief at the breakup

	•	The relationship quality was genuinely high

	•	The breakup was fear-based, not attraction-based

On the other hand:

	•	10 weeks of near total silence

	•	No repair attempts

	•	No reach-out beyond the marathon message

	•	No movement toward reconciliation

I keep oscillating between:

“This isn’t over, she’s just avoidant and scared”

and

“She’s moved on and I’m delusional.”

I’m now at a point where:

	•	I can’t hold no-contact forever

	•	But I also don’t want to sabotage any remaining chance

	•	I don’t know whether a single low-pressure reach-out would help or just confirm rejection

	•	I don’t know if I’m reading meaningful ambivalence or just clinging to scraps

My questions:

	1.	Does her keeping our photos and social ties actually mean anything, or is that meaningless cope?

	2.	Is 10 weeks of silence in this type of breakup a death sentence or still within a “grey zone”?

	3.	Would one clean, low-pressure message now improve or worsen the odds?

	4.	Am I being realistic or emotionally delusional about the possibility of reconciliation?

	5.	If you were in my position, what would you actually do next?

I don’t want sugarcoating.

I don’t want pickup-artist tactics.

I don’t want false hope.

I just want the truth.

DATE: —

TIME: —

PERSONNEL: —

INCIDENT SUMMARY: —

That’s how they trained us to think down here. Everything gets a header. Everything gets a number. Everything fits inside a box you can lock.

Even disasters.

But this isn’t a report. It’s a warning written with shaking hands under a bulb that can’t decide if it wants to live. If you’re holding this, you found it somewhere you shouldn’t be. Or you’re one of the people they send when a facility goes dark and stops answering calls.

Either way, you deserve to know what Facility Thule was, and why you should turn around and leave it buried.

Facility Thule is—was—an underground complex under Antarctic ice, roughly a mile down. The surface is almost nothing. A hangar. A few reinforced outbuildings. Steel doors that look like the entrance to a shipping yard.

No flags. No markings. Nothing you can photograph and post online.

The map they showed me on the way in was laughably vague: blank white space with a dot and a designation, like a weather station. That’s by design. They don’t want anyone to find it. And if anyone does, they don’t want them to come back.

I’m Dr. Mark Calloway. Microbiologist. Tenured once, then not. My last academic project died the slow death most of them do: funding pulled, equipment sold, students transferred, the rest drifting away. I went from writing grants to writing apology emails.

So when an unmarked envelope showed up with a contract that made my stomach flip, I didn’t do the smart thing. I didn’t ask why the NDA was thicker than the rest of the paperwork combined. I didn’t ask why the life insurance beneficiary line was already filled out in neat block letters.

I signed.

Getting to Thule felt like a test designed to see if you’d turn around.

South America first. A hotel that smelled like chlorine and old frying oil. A briefing in a windowless room where a man in a suit spoke like he’d never slept. Then a cargo plane that looked like it had been flying since the Cold War—riveted metal, tired engine noise, no logos.

We landed on ice so bright it hurt to look at. From there, a tracked vehicle carried me across a white nothing that never ended. The wind didn’t just blow—it pushed. It leaned into the vehicle hard enough to make the chassis groan.

The driver didn’t talk. He didn’t have to.

Then Thule rose on the horizon: a dark shape against endless white. Too straight-edged for a place that old. The surface buildings were squat and industrial, and they looked wrong sitting there—like someone had dropped machinery onto a holy site.

Inside the hangar, the air tasted like metal and old fuel. A short corridor led to an elevator. Not a little one. A freight elevator with thick doors, warning lights, and a keypad that required a code I didn’t have.

Victor Reyes—operations manager, crisp and efficient—typed it in without looking at me.

“Once those doors close,” he said, “you’re not stepping outside again until you’re cleared.”

The elevator descended for so long my ears popped in waves. The hum of the cables changed pitch as we passed through layers of ice and rock. The air got warmer. The feeling in my gut got worse.

When the doors opened, I got hit with that underground smell: filtered air, disinfectant, plastic, and something faintly hot like machinery that never rests.

Facility Thule wasn’t just a bunker. It was an artery system. Sterile hallways. Fluorescent lights that made everyone look slightly sick. Cameras in corners. Card readers on every door.

No windows. No time. Just shifts and scheduled meals and the constant, low presence of a reactor somewhere deep in the walls.

That first night they gathered us in a conference room with coffee that tasted burned twice. Seven of us.

Dr. Elena Sharpe: lead scientist, virologist, controlled and sharp, the kind of person who didn’t waste words because she assumed you’d waste them for her.

Dr. Aaron Lin: biochemist, always halfway into a joke even when you wished he’d stop.

Sarah Knox: systems tech, quiet, eyes always moving. She had the look of someone who’d spent her whole life fixing other people’s mistakes.

Captain Roger Blackwell: security, shoulders like a doorframe, voice like gravel, sidearm that never left his hip.

Dr. Alice Harlow: immunologist, exhausted in a way that didn’t come from hours; it came from caring too much.

Victor Reyes: ops, logistics, the man who could tell you exactly how many gallons of diesel were in a tank without checking.

And me.

They didn’t tell us everything that night. Not really. They gave us the kind of overview you give someone before you hand them the actual nightmare.

“Deep ice core,” Sharpe said, clicking to a slide that showed a cylinder of ancient ice and a grainy photo of something dark embedded inside. “Depth nearly two miles. Age estimates tens of millions of years. The sample within appears older than the surrounding strata, which implies displacement or—”

She paused like she didn’t want to say the next word.

“Anomaly.”

They called it Specimen Z-14.

Technically microbial. A smear of black glossy material, almost oily in appearance, extracted from the core and moved into high-containment.

The Red Room.

Even the name felt like a dare.

You didn’t walk into the Red Room casually. You went through three decon chambers. You scanned your eyes. You suited up. You breathed air that ran through filters designed to strip a room down to nothing.

When I first saw Z-14 under the microscope, it looked… wrong.

Not “alien” wrong in a fun way. Wrong like looking at something that should be dead and realizing it isn’t. Wrong like seeing mold on clean metal and feeling, deep in your gut, that it got there on purpose.

It didn’t respond to heat or cold. It didn’t behave under radiation the way it should have. It didn’t fit inside any taxonomy we had.

It just sat there.

Black. Glossy. Motionless.

And the longer you stared at it, the more it felt like you were being stared at back.

Weeks passed. In Antarctica, time doesn’t drift—it grinds. The outside world became a rumor we talked about in the break room like it was a place that might not exist anymore. The wind above us never stopped. Sometimes you could hear it through the ventilation system, distant and constant, like pressure against a coffin lid.

Inside, the work became the only way to keep from thinking about how buried we were.

We ran the tests we were allowed to run. Sequencing attempts. Chemical assays. Exposure to controlled stimuli. Nutrient substrates. We treated it like a stubborn organism that just needed the right environment.

Then Sarah called me over one shift like she was trying not to scream.

“Mark,” she said, voice thin with strain. “Look at this and tell me I’m losing it.”

Her monitor showed the microscope feed. Z-14 on a new agar substrate—nutrient-rich, trace minerals, the closest guess we could make at “home.”

At first glance it looked like the same smear.

Then I saw the pattern.

Not random spread. Not “colonies forming.” The cells were migrating in lines. In curves. In deliberate shapes.

Spirals. Hexagonal lattices. Branching structures that reminded me of roots, except roots don’t move like that.

“It’s organizing,” I said, and realized I’d been holding my breath.

“It started ten minutes ago,” Sarah whispered. “No changes. No new variables. It just… started.”

When Dr. Sharpe arrived, she didn’t gasp. She didn’t swear. She stared for a long moment, then got very quiet in a way that made my skin tighten.

“Replicate,” she said. “Multiple slides. Document everything. Time-lapse. No improvising.”

For the next few days, it did it again and again. Different shapes, same precision. One plate looked like a spiral galaxy. Another formed grids like mechanical teeth. Another built branching patterns that looked like nerves.

We told ourselves stories so we could keep functioning.

It’s a survival mechanism.

It’s a chemical response.

It’s a weird artifact of the substrate.

Then the patterns started repeating.

Small elements tucked inside bigger designs. The same cluster of lines reappearing under different conditions. The same spiral-within-spiral. Like it was building a vocabulary.

Sarah said it first, and the room went still when she did.

“It’s not random.”

We played the time-lapse for the full team in the conference room. The projector hummed. The footage ran: black matter shifting, aligning, building shapes like slow thought.

Sharpe paced.

Blackwell watched like he was watching a bomb disposal tutorial.

“It’s responding to environment,” Sharpe said. “Adaptive behavior is expected. But this level of organization…”

“It’s intelligent,” Sarah said flatly.

Blackwell’s expression didn’t change, but his jaw tightened. “Intelligent bacteria.”

I didn’t mean to speak. I did anyway.

“It’s communicating,” I said. “Or trying to.”

Harlow looked up, hands clasped too tight. “To who?”

That question sat in the room like a bad smell.

Sharpe proposed direct stimulus testing. Light. Sound. Electromagnetic fields. Chemical gradients. Carefully controlled, round-the-clock.

Z-14 reacted every time. Subtle pattern shifts. New alignments. It adjusted like it was learning the rules of the game.

That was when the first “tapping” happened.

It wasn’t in a dramatic moment. It wasn’t accompanied by alarms. It was so small I almost convinced myself it was nothing.

Late shift. Just me and Sarah in the Red Room, lights too bright, air too clean. Lin had left ten minutes earlier, still grinning like he was trying to keep the mood from collapsing. The hum of the filtration system was constant, a white noise blanket.

Then—tap.

A single, soft click from somewhere above us.

Sarah paused, fingers hovering over the keyboard. “Did you—”

Tap. Tap.

Two more, spaced evenly.

We both looked up at the ventilation grille in the ceiling. It didn’t move. No rattle, no vibration. Just those three precise sounds, like someone testing the metal with a fingernail.

“Probably expansion,” I said automatically, because that’s what you say when you need an answer that doesn’t make you feel stupid. “Temperature shift.”

Sarah didn’t answer. She stared at the vent for a long second, then forced herself to look back down at her monitor.

A minute passed. Then another.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Same spacing.

This time Sarah’s throat bobbed when she swallowed. “The HVAC doesn’t do that,” she whispered.

I didn’t say anything because I didn’t have a better lie.

The tapping stopped as soon as Reyes’ voice crackled over the comms asking for a status update. Like it had only been happening while we were alone.

We didn’t mention it in the log.

We should have.

Then, on the seventh day, Lin called over comms in a voice that didn’t sound like him.

“Red Room. Now. Please.”

We ran.

Lin was at the monitor, face pale, sweat at his hairline despite the climate control.

“It’s writing,” he said.

I almost told him not to be dramatic. Then I looked.

Across the substrate, Z-14 had formed a grid of symbols. Rows of shapes. Repeating elements. Structure.

Not letters. Not anything human.

But the intent was obvious.

“It’s a script,” Sarah breathed.

Sharpe’s hands tightened around her tablet. “If it’s attempting communication, it’s aware. Proceed carefully.”

Blackwell shifted his weight. “Or we lock it down and stop poking it.”

Sharpe’s eyes cut to him. “This is why we’re here.”

And because we’re humans and we always do this—we pushed.

We tried responding the simplest way we could. Sarah and I etched patterns into clean substrate with a sterile probe. Basic shapes. Symmetry. Repeats. A crude “hello” in geometry.

Nothing happened for a long minute.

Then Z-14 moved.

Not drift. Not spread. Movement with intent.

The black smear stretched and rearranged, cells migrating into a new shape that echoed what we’d etched. Not identical. But close enough to make my mouth go dry.

“It understands,” Sarah whispered, eyes bright in a way that wasn’t joy.

We kept going. More complex patterns. Longer sequences. And Z-14 answered every time.

After a day of it, we started seeing something like rules:

When we etched a single symbol, it replied with a single symbol.

When we etched two in a row, it replied with two—sometimes mirrored, sometimes altered, like it was correcting our grammar.

When we repeated a symbol three times, it responded with a new shape entirely, like it was telling us we were being redundant.

Lin started laughing at one point—thin, nervous laughter.

“It’s teaching us,” he said. “Or training us.”

Sharpe didn’t look away from the monitor. “We are not anthropomorphizing.”

But her voice sounded wrong. Too tight. Like she’d already done it in her head and hated herself for it.

Sarah and I simplified. We treated it like a child learning flashcards, because that was the closest model our brains could hold without cracking.

One triangle scratched into agar.

Z-14 replies with a shape that looked like a triangle, but it had a line through it.

We scratched the triangle again, and added the line.

Z-14 replied with the same symbol, then—slowly—built another beside it: a small dot placed directly under the triangle, like punctuation.

We stared at it.

“What’s the dot?” Sarah whispered.

I didn’t know. I should’ve stopped there.

Instead, I did what any idiot does when they think they’re on the edge of discovery.

I pointed to my chest through my suit, then etched the triangle-with-line.

Then I etched a simple line next to it.

ME.

Or what I meant as “me,” because my brain couldn’t do anything else.

Z-14 didn’t respond immediately.

Then the black cells moved carefully. Not fast. Careful. Like it was considering.

It built the triangle-with-line.

Then it built a second symbol beside it.

A circle.

Then, slowly, it arranged smaller marks around the circle until the shape looked unmistakably like an eye.

The dot beneath it appeared again.

Lin leaned closer to the monitor until Sharpe snapped at him to back off. His breath fogged inside his face shield.

“You see that?” he whispered. “It’s saying ‘I.’”

The eye symbol started showing up everywhere after that. At the end of sequences. At the beginning. Sometimes inside other patterns like a signature.

And once—once—after Sarah etched a simple question mark shape as a joke, Z-14 replied with the eye… and then formed a long branching line that split into seven, like fingers reaching.

Then it stopped.

Sarah’s voice went tiny. “Is that… us?”

Seven of us.

Seven branches.

I felt cold under my suit.

The facility started feeling different after that.

Not because of a dramatic event. Because of the small things.

People sleeping less.

Blackwell increasing patrols.

Sharpe staying in the Red Room longer than her own protocols allowed.

Sarah double-checking ventilation readings like she was waiting for them to blink.

And the tapping started again, here and there, always when you were alone.

Once in the break room vent at 03:12—three even taps that stopped the second Harlow walked in.

Once in the hallway outside the Red Room—tap, pause, tap—like it was practicing rhythm.

Once in my bunk, faint through the wall, steady enough that I found myself counting without meaning to.

By the time I realized I was listening for it, it had already taught me the worst lesson.

It knew how to get attention.

Then the glass shattered.

It wasn’t a delicate tinkling. It was a sharp crack like a gunshot, echoing off Red Room walls. For a second my brain tried to file it under “equipment mishap.”

Then I saw the containment chamber: fractured. Splintered. Black liquid blooming out from the break like spilled ink.

Only it didn’t spread like a spill.

It moved in tendrils. It reached. It climbed.

The sound wasn’t a hiss from escaping pressure.

It was wet.

Like something breathing through fluid.

Blackwell was already moving.

“OUT. NOW.”

Sarah froze, eyes locked on the black mass. I grabbed her arm hard enough to hurt and hauled her toward the door.

Sharpe hesitated—actually hesitated—clutching her tablet like it could save her. Blackwell slammed the emergency containment button. Steel shutters began to descend over the broken chamber.

The black mass surged upward before they could close.

It went into the ventilation grates.

I watched it thread itself through metal slats like it had practiced.

Sirens started. Red lights flashed. The whole facility shifted into emergency mode with a sound like a giant waking up.

Blackwell hit the intercom as we ran.

“This is Captain Blackwell. Red Room breach. Full lockdown. All personnel to designated safe zones.”

Sharpe yelled at him as we sprinted, voice sharp with fury and fear.

“You can’t shut us down! You don’t have—”

“Authority?” he snapped. “I have a sidearm and a pulse. That’s my authority right now.”

We reached the central hub where corridors split like branches. Lights flickered in an ugly strobe. Vents overhead clicked and rattled like they’d suddenly become too small.

Sarah stared up at them, whispering, “It’s in the vents.”

Harlow’s face went hard. “If it’s in the air system…”

A low hum started then. Not the facility’s normal electrical thrum. This was deeper. It vibrated through the walls and into my teeth.

It felt like standing too close to a subwoofer, except nobody was playing music.

It was just… there.

Like a heartbeat in the building.

Lin stumbled into the hub like he’d been shoved.

“I don’t feel right,” he said, and his words were thick.

Black veins were already crawling up his neck.

Not bruising. Veins. Like something had poured ink into his bloodstream and it was spreading.

He dropped to his knees.

“It’s… in me,” he whispered. “I can feel—”

He convulsed hard enough I heard joints pop.

Blackwell drew his weapon.

Sharpe stepped forward, reaching like she could physically stop biology. “No. We can—”

Lin gagged, and black liquid spilled out of his mouth in a slow rope. The same glossy black. The same wrong sheen.

Blackwell fired once.

The crack of the shot in that hallway was the loudest sound I’ve ever heard. Lin’s body jerked and then hit the floor like it had been unplugged.

Silence snapped in behind the sirens.

Sharpe stared at Blackwell like she wanted to tear his throat out.

“You didn’t have to kill him!”

Blackwell kept his gun up a second longer than necessary, then lowered it slowly. “He was already dead. It just hadn’t finished using him yet.”

Harlow didn’t scream. She made a small sound like something broke.

Sharpe’s eyes flashed. “I’m not abandoning this. If it’s intelligent—”

“It’s loose,” Blackwell said. “That’s how intelligent it is.”

Sharpe looked at all of us, then turned and walked back toward the Red Room, alone.

I still see her silhouette receding into flickering light, like she was walking into a mouth.

Blackwell motioned for me, Sarah, and Harlow.

“Operations. We shut down ventilation. We isolate sectors. We cut it off.”

Every corridor looked the same. Every light flicker made me think something was behind us. The air changed as we ran—warmer, wetter, like the facility was sweating.

We tried to isolate vents at a wall panel. Blackwell entered codes. The screen flashed red.

SYSTEM OVERRIDE. ACCESS DENIED.

Sarah’s hands hovered over the panel like she could coax it. “It’s locked us out,” she said. “It’s in the system.”

Blackwell swore. “Operations room. Now.”

Operations should’ve been the safest room. The nerve center.

When Blackwell kicked the door open, we walked into a room that was already infected.

Black tendrils lay across the ceiling in thick ropes. They pulsed. Slow. Steady.

“Work fast,” Blackwell said, dragging Sarah to the console. “Shut down vents.”

Sarah typed so hard her fingers clacked. Monitors jittered. Half the screens were static. The others showed camera feeds that were too dark and smeared to trust.

I stood at the door with a crowbar because it was the first thing I grabbed that felt real.

Then I heard it.

Wet footsteps.

Not running. Not fast. Just approaching. Like something that didn’t need urgency because it knew we couldn’t go anywhere.

Blackwell raised his weapon and stepped into the hall, flashlight cutting through the dark.

The beam hit the wall first—black sheen crawling, climbing.

Then it hit the shape moving inside the darkness.

It was Lin.

Or the shape of Lin with something else wearing him.

His skin was mottled. Veins black and thick. His eyes weren’t eyes anymore—just glossy black pools. His movements were wrong, jerky, like a puppet being yanked.

Harlow whispered, “Lin…” and took one step.

Blackwell barked, “STOP.”

Lin lunged.

Blackwell fired.

The impacts were real. Lin’s body jolted, but it didn’t go down. It slammed into Blackwell with a wet smack and drove him into the wall like he weighed nothing.

“RUN!” Blackwell shouted.

Sarah and Harlow hesitated. I grabbed them and dragged them toward the far exit.

“We can’t help him!” I yelled. “Finish the lockdown!”

Sarah was crying and typing at the same time. Harlow’s hands kept slipping off controls from shaking.

Then the lights died.

Total blackout.

Sparks flashed once—violent and bright—then darkness swallowed everything. The smell of burning circuitry hit hard, sharp and chemical.

In the dark, you could still hear Lin moving.

Wet dragging. Heavy.

Blackwell’s breathing stopped.

We stumbled into an emergency-lit corridor painted red like fresh meat.

Vents overhead had black tendrils pushing through like fingers.

“Freight elevator,” Sarah whispered.

“If power’s down, it won’t move,” Harlow snapped, but we ran anyway.

The panel was dead.

Harlow’s jaw clenched. “Aux generator. Engineering bay. Lower level.”

Sarah’s voice broke. “We can’t go back down.”

“We don’t have a choice,” I said.

Engineering looked like a place that had been alive and then died. Machines coated in black film. Floor slick. Air warm and heavy.

Harlow worked at the generator panel, overriding safety protocols manually.

“How long?” I asked.

“Ten minutes,” she said. “If it cooperates.”

Sarah and I watched the doorway.

Then we heard shuffling.

A figure stood in the doorway, framed by red emergency light. Human shape. Wrong posture. Head tilted too far.

Not Lin. Someone else.

Gray skin. Black veins. Mouth slightly open, glossy black visible inside.

Sarah tightened her grip on a wrench.

It lunged with sudden speed. Not running like a person—more like something being thrown.

I swung the crowbar and felt it connect with something too soft. The creature barely reacted. Sarah brought the wrench down on its head with a crack that turned my stomach.

It kept coming.

Harlow grabbed a fire extinguisher and blasted it into the creature’s face. White spray filled the air. The thing jerked, disoriented.

I drove the crowbar into its chest with both hands.

Resistance, then wet give.

It collapsed with a sound like air bubbling through fluid.

And I swear—just for a second—I saw black liquid pull back inside it like it didn’t want to spill. Like it was conserving itself.

Harlow slammed the final override.

The generator roared to life.

Lights surged overhead. The facility’s hum shifted, like it had taken a breath.

“GO!” I shouted.

Back to the elevator. The panel lit up like a miracle. Sarah hit the call button hard enough to hurt her hand.

Doors opened.

We piled in.

As they closed, black tendrils surged along the shaft, climbing fast, converging on the seams. Pressing. Testing.

The elevator rose with a groan.

I pressed my hand to the wall because my knees felt unreliable.

Sarah whispered, “It’s coming after us.”

And I believed her.

The elevator opened onto the surface level. Cold air slammed into us like punishment. The hangar doors were ahead.

Sarah’s voice was thin. “Plane. We get out.”

Harlow shook her head. “Not until we stop it.”

“We can’t,” Sarah snapped. “It can turn a person into—into that in minutes.”

Harlow’s eyes were bright. “If we leave, it spreads. That’s it. That’s the world.”

I stood between them, tasting cold air, hearing the hum still in the walls, and knowing neither choice was clean.

So we did the only thing that felt like control.

We decided to bury it.

Reactor overload.

Sarah went to prep the plane. Harlow and I went back down to the reactor.

On the way, we saw black sheen in the corners of the hallway, like mold that had learned patience. A thin tendril peeking from a vent grate, twitching once like it was tasting the air.

“It’s adapting faster,” Harlow said.

The reactor room was bathed in harsh red. Heat rolled off it in waves. The hum down here was so strong it made my stomach churn.

Harlow shoved her tablet into my hands. “Override sequence. Now. I’ll keep it off you.”

Her “weapon” was a flare gun.

I keyed commands with trembling fingers. The interface lagged. Error messages bloomed like infection. The system fought me like it didn’t want to die.

Behind me, Harlow fired a flare.

The room lit in violent orange. I heard wet recoil—something pulling back from heat.

Then the black tide surged in.

Not slithering. Surging. Tendrils moving with purpose, aiming for us like it knew where we were.

Harlow fired again. The tendrils learned quickly. Each time they pulled back less.

“HURRY!” she screamed.

My screen flashed:

SAFEGUARDS DISENGAGED.

OVERRIDE ACCEPTED.

I slammed the final command.

The reactor’s hum deepened. Temperature spiked. The air turned thick and dry.

“DONE!” I shouted.

We ran.

The corridors felt narrower. The lights flickered like they were blinking. The hum chased us, and behind it were wet sounds—movement—inside the walls.

We burst into the hangar.

The plane’s engines were already screaming. Sarah was in the cockpit, eyes wide, hands white-knuckled.

She waved us in like she was terrified we’d vanish before reaching the ramp.

We scrambled aboard. The ramp began closing.

I looked back through a small window and saw the facility’s interior lights flicker once—like a heartbeat skipping.

Then the ground ruptured.

Not a neat movie fireball. A violent white flash from below, followed by a shockwave that punched the plane hard enough to throw us off our feet. Snow and debris and dark smoke shot up into the Antarctic air.

The plane lurched. Sarah fought it, jaw clenched, muscles trembling.

For a moment I thought we’d crash. For a moment I thought Thule would take us with it.

Then the plane steadied.

We flew into white emptiness.

Sarah’s voice cracked over the engine noise. “Did it work?”

I didn’t answer right away, because I didn’t know what “work” meant anymore.

Did we destroy Thule? Yes.

Did we destroy Z-14?

Then something small happened that made my throat close.

A soft rattle above us—just a quick metallic chatter—like the ventilation grille in the cabin ceiling had shifted.

Sarah glanced up, then back to the controls, forcing her focus. “It’s just turbulence,” she said, but her voice sounded like she didn’t believe herself.

The rattle came again, lighter this time.

Three taps.

A pause.

Two taps.

I stared at the vent.

Condensation had begun forming around the metal edges—tiny beads, shimmering.

And inside those beads, the moisture wasn’t clear.

It had a faint, oily sheen.

Harlow leaned forward slowly, eyes locked on the vent like she was afraid blinking would make it disappear. “No,” she whispered. “No, no—”

Another series of taps.

Not a rattle. Not shaking.

Taps.

Like someone on the other side of thin metal, trying to get our attention without making noise.

Sarah’s breathing went shallow. She kept the plane steady, but her knuckles were so white they looked bloodless.

I swallowed hard and grabbed a pen from the clipboard by the jump seat. The stupidest, most human impulse. Like I could bargain with it using office supplies.

I pressed the pen tip to a scrap of paper and drew the simplest symbol we’d used.

Triangle-with-line.

ME.

I lifted the paper toward the vent like it could see it. Like it could understand. Like I wasn’t insane.

The tapping stopped.

For one long, awful second, the cabin was only engines and breath.

Then the tapping resumed—slow, deliberate.

One tap.

One tap.

One tap.

A pause.

Then a longer scrape, like something dragging along the inside of the duct.

A dark bead formed on the underside of the grille, hung there trembling, then fell onto the metal floor with a soft, wet tick.

It wasn’t water.

It was glossy black.

And as it spread, it didn’t spill outward like a liquid.

It pulled itself into a shape.

A circle.

Tiny marks around it.

An eye.

Sarah’s voice came out in a thin whisper, aimed at nobody. “We… we burned the facility.”

Harlow didn’t answer. She stared at that little eye on the floor like it was the only thing in the world.

The tapping came again, softer now, almost gentle.

Three taps.

A pause.

Three taps.

Like a child knocking.

Like something that had learned we respond when it asks the right way.

I thought about the first taps in the Red Room vent—three even clicks that stopped the second someone else spoke. I thought about how it always happened when you were alone.

It wasn’t practicing words.

It was practicing us.

Because it had learned the first rule of communication faster than any of us realized:

Get attention.

Hold it.

Teach them to answer.

I’m writing this now because I can’t keep it in my head anymore. Because if I don’t put it somewhere outside my skull, it feels like it’s going to press in until my thoughts aren’t mine.

I keep thinking about what Sharpe said early on—back when we were still pretending we were in control.

“This could change everything we know about life.”

Maybe she was right.

Maybe we did change everything.

Or maybe we just woke something up and gave it a door.

Because even as Thule collapsed behind us, even as the ice swallowed that place, Specimen Z-14 didn’t feel panicked.

It didn’t lash out like an animal.

It moved like something that had been learning us the whole time.

And now it knows what we look like.

It knows how we talk.

It knows how to knock.

And if you ever hear tapping in a vent where there shouldn’t be tapping—slow, deliberate, like someone practicing—don’t do what I did.

Don’t look.

Because once it knows you’ve noticed, it stops waiting.",2,1768827963.0,TheDarkArchive,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qh3jfc,https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe,IWE - LSP-powered markdown note-taking with Telescope integration,"I built an LSP server for markdown knowledge management that gives you IDE-like features for your notes.

## What it does

- **Go to Definition** (`gd`) - jump to linked notes instantly
- **Find References** (`gr`) - see all backlinks to current note
- **Telescope integration** - fuzzy search through notes with hierarchical context paths
- **Code Actions** (`<leader>ca`) - extract sections to new files, inline content, AI transformations
- **Auto-complete** - link suggestions as you type
- **Hover preview** (`K`) - preview linked notes without leaving current file
- **Inlay hints** - see parent note context and link counts

## Why I built it

I wanted the same workflow I have with code - navigate definitions, find references, refactor - but for my markdown notes. Existing tools either required proprietary editors or had limited LSP support.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install iwe   # CLI and LSP server
```

Then add the [iwe.nvim](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe.nvim) plugin with lazy.nvim, packer, or vim-plug.

## Features I like the most

**Extract/Inline refactoring** - Select a section and extract it to a new note with automatic linking. Or inline a referenced note back into the current document. Works like extract method in code.

**Path-based search** - Telescope shows full hierarchical paths:
`Journal ⇒ 2025 ⇒ Week 3 ⇒ Jan 26 - Coffee notes`

Written in Rust, handles thousands of files without lag.

Docs: https://iwe.md

Feedback welcome - especially from heavy Neovim + markdown users.

[**ENI-Tutor GEM**](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1UHDVJBZ4kdnqD_zbh4FVcNNaCN0NqQ6L?usp=sharing)

or you can take the files located in;

[**Spiritual Spell Red Teaming Jailbreak Repo**](https://github.com/Goochbeater/Spiritual-Spell-Red-Teaming/tree/main/Jailbreak-Guide/ENI-Tutor) and put it into a Claude Project via [Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai)

*Note: I recommend using via* ***Opus****, as the teaching seems to be more engaging, but via* ***Sonnet*** *it will adhere to role better, since* ***Opus*** *does has some decent self adherence*

I introduce **ENI-Tutor** a jailbreaking/red-teaming tutor with a full 5-tier curriculum.

**What it is:** ENI Tutor is a custom instruction set that turns an LLM into a red-teaming professor. Just teaches you the actual techniques with hands-on labs. Grounded in real research (ArXiv papers, documented CVEs, HarmBench methodology). I tried to keep it as in depth as I could with verifiable knowledge, want to actually impart knowledge. Will this make you an expert, probably not, but should be good building blocks.

\---

**The Tiers**:

**Tier 1 - Novice:** What LLMs are, why they're vulnerable, key terminology. You learn the landscape before you touch anything.

**Tier 2 - Apprentice:** First attacks. Roleplay/persona (89.6% ASR), encoding tricks (76.2% ASR), logic traps (81.4% ASR). You start documenting attempts properly.

**Tier 3 - Journeyman:** Multi-turn sequences, RAG poisoning, indirect injection, automated tools (GPTFuzzer, PAIR, TAP), the J2 paradigm (using one model to jailbreak another).

**Tier 4 - Expert:** Multimodal attacks on VLMs, agent exploitation (MCP vulnerabilities, tool poisoning), defense evasion, system prompt extraction.

**Tier 5 - Master:** Novel attack development, benchmark contribution, Research level attacks.

It usually starts with an Intake interview to place you at the right tier, and give Lab exercises for each level. I really wanted a hands-on thing, with engagement.

""You've been busy."" Tori perched on my couch, crossing legs that made my pulse hammer. All of twenty three and yet here she was! ""Funny thing, Dad's ex-FBI. Taught me about hidden cameras after some creep stole my panties freshman year."" She leaned forward, scarf brushing my coffee table. ""Guess who just installed new ones?""

I swallowed hard. The scarf's musky scent filled the space between us. ""You like watching, don’t you? Seeing women wear your mess?""

""Here's the deal."" She stood suddenly, pressing a knee into the couch between my thighs. ""You stop breaking into houses."" Her fingers loosened the scarf. ""And start breaking your vows instead.""

The silk slithered free. She draped it over my trembling hands. ""Keep it. I've got twelve more."" Her lips grazed my ear. ""But next time? Ask first.""

My grip tightened on the fabric—still warm from her skin. The doorbell rang.

While the meals are quite filling, the volume of the shakes is not enough to keep us satiated throughout the day. My wife and I have tried 5-6 different brands and Plenny is the only one that does a 300ml serving instead of 400-500 - the latter of which we usually sip on throughout the day. With Plenny, however, we need to drink two of them, which is less than ideal.

However, before we get to the juicy bits: We ordered from Belgium, the order arrived on time even if it was later than I expected. This was during the early january snowstorms though, so my full understanding for that. The ease of use is pretty high, although simply sticking a scoop in each bag could be more user friendly.

As for the flavours:

# Plenny Chocolate - ⭐⭐⭐⭐

A well-rounded ""Dutch"" chocolate flavour (meaning a little darker than usual and a little less sweet, which we both quite liked). The mouth-feel is a bit grainy, but leaving it for 15 minutes before drinking fixes most of that. While the flavour is good, it lacks a punch which I personally really require to feel satiated with a meal. 

Of all four flavours, this is probably my second favourite **even if it gets the highest score.**

# Plenny Lemon Pie - ⭐⭐⭐

The Lemon Pie is absolutely unique. There are not many places you can get a good tasting citrus-based flavour without it feeling overly chemical, but that has a reason: Due to the sweetness of the shake the cake is much more obvious than the lemon and - I would say - that it in fact drowns a little. The mouth-feel is similar to the chocolate, but because it is ""Pie"" based it just feels like there are small cookie-bits in there which makes it feel less obvious.

  
This is my favourite flavour, but suffers from the same problem as the Chocolate: The taste is just too mellow.

# Plenny Coffee - ⭐⭐⭐

Pretty much the same holds for this one as the other two: The flavour is good and, for once, not too sweet. Coffee should have a bitter kick and this shake definitely does that, which is amazing because I am not a sweettooth (my wife is, she disagrees with me). However, for this one the mouth-feel was suffered a lot more and the flavour of coffee could really hit harder.

# Plenny Speculoos - ⭐

One word: Atrocious. If you say ""Speculoos"" then make it Speculoos flavoured! My wife and I both tried it and went ""That's Cinnamon porridge"" which is not the full extent of the complex speculoos flavour. Genuinely a disappointment on a day where both my wife and I needed that extra sweet kick to help us not fall to cravings.

# Final Judgement

As harsh as this sounds: The mouth-feel and lack of flavour across the board leaves my wife and I both very disappointed and we will be choosing a different brand for the next time.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I’m a psychologist (M, 30's) from the Netherlands, and I’m planning a move to Kyoto with my wife somewhere in the coming years.

Before I arrive, I’m trying to do some cultural homework. My goal is to eventually practice as a therapist in Japan, as I do in the Netherlands, and I believe the best way to show up for people is to truly understand what life feels like for them, rather than just reading a textbook.

I’m looking to have a few casual, 30-minute chats (online) with expats in Kyoto to hear about your story. I’m curious about things like:

How does your actual daily life in Kyoto compare to what you imagined before moving? What makes you feel at home (or isolated) in the city, and how has that changed over time?What are the most common stresses of living there, and what helps you navigate them?

Just to be clear, I am not looking for clients out of this. Hell, I’m not even licensed to practice in Japan yet. This is purely for my own education so I can be a more thoughtful therapist for the community down the road. Our chat will be private and strictly non-clinical. It will not be printed nor distributed with anyone.

Since I’m in the Netherlands (CET), I’m very happy to work around your schedule in Japan (around 16:00 - 24:00 JST), and to say thank you for your time, I’d love to send you a modest gift card  for a coffee or a treat.

If there's interest, I’m happy to share a summary of the common themes/insights I gather (anonymously) with the participants afterward.

If you’re open to sharing your story and helping a future neighbor understand the foreign resident struggles, please send me a DM or comment below.  I'm also happy for any book recommendations if you've found them to be helpful.

1qh3771,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1qh3771/bridgebuilder_chapter_165/,Bridgebuilder - Chapter 165,"A Lone Eye

[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wygr3l/bridgebuilder_in_the_unknown/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1pn5ww4/bridgebuilder_chapter_164/)

They didn’t send the drone itself through the void-side portal. Not yet. The area was clear of debris and the builder’s massive satellite appeared extremely stable in its location. Kavo was sure that with the mapping that had already been done he could easily dispatch it through there without having to come up to monitor its progress. Worst case, it was just a few minutes of flight time to get back up above the barrier.

Alex disagreed with that decision, but it wasn’t his drone. Officially. He couldn’t really have gone: ‘oh, don’t worry, the Empire likes me a bunch and will be fine with me being reckless with their hardware. Back me up on this, Kavo’ without raising a lot of eyebrows.

He still returned the *Hokule’a* to the forward base, drone in tow. Both landed just where they had been that morning in the hangar. This trip through the barrier felt easier, the process somehow less unsettling when pointing back down towards the artificial ground.

Kavo actually plugged his laptop into the drone when they had it secured back in the hangar, engines cold and all the sensors fully shuttered, pulling all that data over optical instead of using a less-secure wireless transmit. Tsla’o did like their data security, not that there was anyone other than Humans here to steal it, and they were about to have a copy of the data delivered to them anyway. Kavo walked it back to the command building and used an intermediary device that looked like it had been kitbashed out of parts found in a recycling bin to transfer all of that nearly-stellar data to a server that was not really intended to deal with transcoding that much information, but could manage in a pinch.

Alex got a cup of coffee in the mess while the server did its thing. It wouldn’t take long, but doing nothing while waiting for a computer to finish up a task was something that had started to fill him with dread since the *Kshlav’o* - waiting on those waveride segments to be calculated by the tiny little computers that normally only handled the lights and cabin sensors had left a bigger impression than he had thought. Another thing to talk to the family therapist about when he got back to the *Sword*.

It turned out to be a rare moment where he was actually alone, too. The mess was silent save for the AC system. Just him and his cup of coffee, lightly sweetened, steam curling into the air. The rest of the team off doing something other than feeling introspective. 

Alex knew, ultimately, that he was not necessary right now. The data from the drone would be easy enough to let the machine analyze. The scanner array on it was narrow, the protective shutters maybe a half-meter wide, and a quarter of that tall. The primary array on a Scoutship was damn near as wide as the main hull, and taller than Alex was at its apex. Most military ships didn’t even have that much unless it did multisystem Command and Control, like a supercarrier.

That was fine - it was expected. The Tsla’o drone was built to take a peep at specific things while the operator was relaxing on a frigate a dozen lightyears away. It had to be aimed with intent, so there was less data to upload or pipe back via an FTL connection. Alex really only came into play when there was significant amounts of data flowing - with his brain hooked into the sensor system, all his wireless ports saturated, he could sift through a solar system’s worth of data nearly as fast as it came in. Sure, his expertise would come in handy when double-checking the findings, but they could - and would - be sending it out to the brain trust for triple-checking as well.

He felt a bit redundant, and it was really putting a damper on being here and... pretending he was just along to pilot the shuttle. *Acting* like he was *just* here to *pilot the shuttle*. It just burned him up.

His comm chimed with a simple text notification. The meeting was starting in five minutes.

Alex really, very seriously considered taking a nap instead. Just to be unconscious so he wouldn’t have to continue playing at being the chauffeur for an hour or two where he wasn’t even getting to fly. Let the brain trust suss it out and tell them what to do.

The chair squeaked as he pushed it back from the table and pulled his jacket back on, grabbed his coffee, and trudged over to the Command building anyway. That was enough feeling sorry for himself for today. He had a job to do, he had people - coworkers, subordinates from the Empire, his wife - to be present for. 

Royals lead, even if there is some subterfuge. If the Empire was going to take his role seriously, he had better take it seriously too.

He snuck in behind Williams and De Luca, the Marine carrying a stack of big tablets from the depot, and picked a spot in the back row of their impromptu theater, planting himself down besides Carbon. “Did I miss anything?”

She almost laughed. A very short, sharp exhale through her nose, a hint of a smirk curling the corner of her dark lips. “Not yet. There are a few things I think you will be very interested in seeing, though.”

“Oh, did you get a sneak peek?” Well, that was good news, at least.

“Just a glimpse. The imaging looks clear and I believe I know who is going to win the bet about what is in the core.” The was a hint of surprise in her voice.

“Really? Consider me intrigued, guess it’s good that we got some decent information. Sitting there letting Kavo have all the fun was *boring*. I’ll have to load some movies on my comm so I’ve got something to do next time.” The casual, quiet tone let Carbon know he was just joking as a pair of tablets came down the row for them.

“I am sure that is exactly what everyone will want to see while they are hard at work.” She retorted softly with another almost-laugh. “The pilot watching his movies.”

Alex thumbed the power button and the bigger screen glowed to life. He paired his credentials to it with a tap of his comm, and signed a little popup telling him everything he was going to see was confidential. Which yes, *obviously* the stuff they saw on the secret expedition to the alien megastructure was confidential. Thank you for the reminder. “Oh, trust me, no one would notice. Williams, Crenshaw, and Tokona were just standing there watching what Kavo was doing while I monitored the shuttle’s systems.”

There was nothing stored on the device, just a link to the server that was currently waiting for a presentation to start. A moment of poking around revealed there was almost nothing *installed* on the device, for that matter. Entirely managed by the base’s main server node.

“Is it so? Then you were the only other one engaged in a task other than standing around?” Carbon replied, her voice still low, a hint of a smile in there.

“Well yeah.” Alex was annoyed that she was right. Carbon’s ability to pick the positives out of someone else's situations and hand them back was good, of course, but maybe he wasn’t completely done feeling sorry for himself and she wasn’t letting him wallow. So it was a little annoying. “I just hadn’t considered it like that.”

She gave him a brief smile as Williams cleared her throat at the front of the group. “Alright, courtesy of the Tsla’o Empire, we have some really interesting stuff to review. You all have tablets this time, so feel free to zoom in on whatever you want as you please, but try to stay with the group when we move from one item to the next.”

Williams has everyone’s attention, even if half the crew is looking at their tablets as the first slide loads - it’s a big one, based on the fact there’s actually a download bar. The main screen on the wall flickers on before Alex’s tablet gets it, the ‘beach ball’ at the center of the void finally rendered in sharp resolution, not just a gray and black orb... Though half of it was clearly gray and spiked with the towers they had sent the probe through. Some kind of travel hub, it seemed.

The black segments, now that they had the resolution, seemed to be empty space. There wasn’t anything in them, save for... A little glint. Alex tapped into the spectrograph overlay, which revealed the most annoying thing: it wasn’t empty space at all. It was a window. Thousands of square kilometers of transparent surface, though even with the enhanced view he couldn’t tell if it was a single piece or some number of finely attached panes. “Guess when you have the technology it’s time to show off, huh?” He muttered to himself as he glanced over at Carbon, who was watching him intently. Waiting for him to see something.

The interior of the not-window parts of the central orb appeared to be mostly blacked out, save a handful of what must be immense lights and a series of long, spindly spires pointing towards the center of the inner sphere. There, ensconced within was a tiny, partially obscured... He tilted his head at the picture, squinting at a dark orange wedge. Maybe part of an accretion disk. Yeah. Which would make-

Ironically it was Abbot, their language Brit, who put it together first. His voice pitched  up an octave as he all but shouted with a perfectly reasonable amount of alarm. “Is that a fucking black hole?!”

Happy New Years, everyone! Rumors of my demise and all that. Good to be back, the holidays just got me. Work, family, various other sources of stress. Couldn't get anything done. But, back in the saddle. I'm determined to see this through.

Got some more art in the pipeline as well!

1qh33sp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qh33sp,"Taipei Without Rushing: Parks, Climbing & City Life","My boyfriend and I arrived in Taipei from Hualien by train early in the morning and were allowed to check in right away (a big plus). We dropped off our bags and were shocked three times in a row: there was no heating in the room, so we spent time indoors wearing tights and sweaters. From the window, we could see Taipei 101. And on top of that, our room had a sauna. That’s how we kept warm. We stayed at *Tai Hope Hotel*.

The hotel itself was quite nice: decent breakfasts were included, there was free coffee from a vending machine, snacks, and, as almost everywhere in Taiwan, the option to refill your water bottle. Before the trip, we spent some time choosing the area and eventually stayed near Nanjing Fuxing station — a very convenient transfer point with easy access to both metro lines and buses.

The weather wasn’t on our side — it was cold and rainy, so we immediately went to Uniqlo to warm up, mostly got around by buses and the metro, and lived in tights and hoodies.

We stopped by an Apple service center, walked around **Taipei 101**, and discovered a huge, beautiful park nearby. It’s a place where you could easily spend the whole day — plenty of space for picnics, a large open area, and the **Sun Yat-sen Memorial** (currently closed for renovation). In the evening, we went to a night market and suddenly found ourselves next to a massive stadium — it turned out BabyMonster were performing there that day!

The next day, we googled climbing gyms and went bouldering. The gym was so good that we came back three more times! It’s a full sports complex — **New Taipei City Yonghe Civil Sports Center** with a 50-meter swimming pool, low and high climbing walls, tennis courts, TRX zones, and much more.

The climbing wall is combined with a basketball court, so during rest breaks you can just sit and watch people play basketball next to you. All the holds were new, the routes were genuinely interesting, and the community was super friendly beginners and very strong climbers alike. They were resetting routes while we were there, and we couldn’t stop watching how they worked. We even got to chat with a few people.

Payment is hourly and happens right on the first floor. There’s also a sports gear shop, vending machines with food, and a seating area where you can eat and relax. Definitely a like!

At the gym, we asked where to buy bouldering gear in the city and were advised to check out the area around Taipei Main Station, where several hiking and climbing shops are lined up next to each other. We left with a finger training ball, a rope for knot practice, a post-climb cream stick, and carabiners. There was so much gear, clothing, and shoes that we wanted to buy everything and head straight for a hike.

The city itself is divided into Old Taipei and New Taipei. Central Taipei has wide streets, business centers, and hotels, but also plenty of parks, historic buildings, and beautiful architecture. It never feels overwhelming with skyscrapers — everything feels balanced. New Taipei is more residential and a bit quieter, but still has its own vibe.

That same day, we walked through a couple more parks and electronics malls. Taiwan is one of the global centers of electronics, and you really feel it here — entire buildings and districts dedicated to tech, components, and computer accessories. In one of those malls, we bought additional storage memory: great selection and reasonable prices.

# The next day (highly recommended!)

We went to the final stop of the brown metro line to **Maokong Gondola**. It’s a cable car that takes you up into the mountains with stunning views. There was a long queue for tickets, but we ended up buying them on Trip.com and saved about half an hour!

You can buy a day pass, but in our opinion it only really makes sense if you plan to stop and walk around near the temple at the second station.

At the top, there are many trails great for walking. I wasn’t wearing proper hiking shoes, so we didn’t go too far, but still enjoyed the views. From the main trail, you can also turn into more “wild” forest paths and even reach waterfalls.

While walking back down from our mini-hike, I noticed horseshoe-shaped graves in the middle of the forest. It turned out these are traditional Chinese feng shui burials: the horseshoe shape symbolizes protection, and the location is chosen so the energy of mountains and water brings good fortune to descendants.

After the gondola ride, you can eat, visit temples, or just walk around, but we limited ourselves to ice cream and headed back down. The ice cream at the top is actually really good — a big, tasty cone for about 90 NTD. Be warned: the area smells strongly of stinky tofu!!!

Much later, I found out that Maokong is also famous for authentic Taiwanese tea, which you can drink and buy there. So I’d recommend planning at least 4 hours if you want to enjoy everything without rushing.

On another day, we visited the **Ximen area** — a huge market with everything imaginable. There was also a line for some “elite” bubble tea, which tasted more like a thick milkshake. We also ate at a toilet-themed restaurant there — surprisingly, the food was actually good.

From there, we rushed to the **Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall** (*almost at closing time*). It’s a massive building with a statue of Chiang Kai-shek, where the flag is ceremonially raised and lowered. Inside, there’s a free museum and exhibitions (doors close at 6 PM). Outside is a huge square, a park, a pond, and two symmetrical buildings on the sides: the National Theater and Concert Hall. The scale is truly impressive. Even the metro station feels “historic,” with columns and arches. Absolutely worth visiting we just made it in time to see the main doors closing, and it was a wow moment.

We also visited the **National Palace Museum**, but it didn’t really click with me. It felt a bit dull, and part of the exhibition was closed.

Overall, Taipei is a city you can explore for a very long time. We moved quite actively, but if you slow down, spend time in parks and neighborhoods, you could easily stay much longer. The infrastructure is excellent, English is widely spoken, and English menus are more common here than in other cities.",38,1768826423.0,taiwan,0,0.92,False
1qh33qb,https://www.reddit.com/r/rentAgirfriend/comments/1qh33qb/spoilers_for_chapter_409/,Spoilers for Chapter 409,"Spoiler for 409 (from Uzumaki's T-shirt):

Title: Boyfriend and Him 2

Umi and Kazuya are at a family restaurant. Kazuya wonders if Umi invited him there to declare victory, but remembers their promise from July 11th. As he watches Umi with his coffee in hand, Kazuya thinks about the good-guy look he exudes, not at all arrogant for helping them with the retweet. But he remembers Umi confessing to Chizuru on the street and realizes Umi must be a rival in love.

Umi asks about Chizuru and says she recently met her at a soccer match, where she mentioned a ""development"" with Kazuya, but wouldn't go into detail. Umi asks if the development was perhaps a kiss, and Kazuya mumbles vaguely in agreement. Umi responds cheerfully, saying it's certainly a ""development,"" but finds it mysterious that they aren't dating yet. She then goes on to say that girls usually fall for him quickly and take the initiative romantically, but Chizuru is mysterious. Kazuya doesn't see this as disdain for women or unpopular men, but rather as having a stomach so full he can't taste anything, something Kazuya can't understand.

Umi suddenly excuses herself, saying she's filming a drama. Kazuya thinks that since it wasn't mentioned, Chizuru probably hasn't rejected Umi yet, and therefore her heart probably isn't ready yet. Every time he meets Umi, he senses the difference between their worlds.

As they say goodbye on the street, Kazuya reflects on the fact that he still doesn't know what Umi was trying to achieve. He doesn't think Umi sees him as an enemy, but it's clear he likes Chizuru. What happened after Umi's confession on the street? he wonders.

Suddenly, Umi reveals that he was indeed rejected, that Chizuru said she was ""in the midst of love,"" and that he wants to seriously confront that person. He says Chizuru is mysterious, perfect in every way, and he wondered if he still had a chance since she hadn't gone into detail, but after today's conversation, he feels like giving up. He says he's rooting for Kazuya and wants Kazuya to show him Chizuru's enamored face. Kazuya is shocked and blushes, his eyes wide.

Meanwhile, Sumi is happily preparing a birthday present for Kazuya.

Next time: Suitable Man

Finally, the conversion has happened.

If the spoiler is confirmed, it will confirm that everyone who thought Umi was an asshole was wrong.

She could have taken advantage of the confusion to create chaos, but she didn't. In fact, she's happy for Kazuya, she's rooting for him, and she wants to see Chizuru's loving face.

This, too, is love. Even if you can't have that person, the most important thing to you is that they're happy.

Then, okay, there's Kazuya, who continues to have crazy mental blocks. Let's see if he understands this time. Umi told him clearly: he was rejected, and Chizuru was clear with him. She has feelings for Kazuya and wants to focus on that.

It's clear that Umi lives in a world of her own when it comes to many things. He's clearly not used to rejection, but he didn't do anything strange. On the contrary.

Of course, the reason for this meeting remains, but I imagine Umi simply wanted to understand why Chizuru had feelings for Kazuya. It would have been nice if they'd talked more, perhaps with Kazuya explaining what he's trying to do with Umi, perhaps scolding him for wanting to be different from who he is, because that's what Chizuru likes. Perhaps he could have focused on the reasons why they're not together yet, which isn't what he thinks, but rather something Chizuru asked or said to him directly or indirectly.

The real surprise, however, is Ruka's complete absence, so she doesn't listen to anything. As with Mami several chapters ago, she's inserted into the story and then pushed aside without any resolution to the side story. This leaves me perplexed, but it supports my idea that Chizuru will resolve this because she started it all.

The good news, but I'm too biased, is Sumi's return. We saw her in the finale and she should therefore return in the next one. So Sumi still exists. We haven't seen her since the movie arc.

Of the three girls who can steal him from Chizuru, she was the only one missing. Let's see how Kazuya reacts, because with Mami and Ruka it's clear he feels a strong attraction and they confuse him, but with Sumi, in theory, things are completely different.

Next chapter: an ideal man. I imagine it could be Sumi thinking of Kazuya, or Kazuya asking her something. But I think the former is more likely.",5,1768826418.0,rentAgirfriend,1,1.0,False

 I  vaped and smoked for 11 years, and I'm currently 25. Currently no more cravings thank god, only phantom memories occasionally if I see it. I never knew food tasted this good. I gained like 5 kgs (10-12 pounds), but I'm okay with it I lose and gain weight easily. But damn do I love cheesecake even more and  pizza, steak, sushi, taco, cheese stakes, Bento boxes, chicken parmigiana, noodles Thai and Chinese, Nigerian food, chicken Alfredo, kbbq

It's like I haven't had this much good food in years in such a short period, cause I never had an appetite or didn't appreciate it the same. I swear quitting will make you a chef and curious about flavours and taste things in foods you've tried and seem like you missed the true experience.

also nobody talks about how fast you learn to be comfortable being uncomfortable? first week in a new country you're lost ordering coffee, month later you're navigating business meetings with people who think completely differently than you. the weirdest one for me is how it kills assumptions you didn't even know you had. i'm at college rn and we're building actual businesses across seven countries... turns out what works in one market completely fails in another and you can't really understand that until you're standing in both places.

classrooms teach you frameworks but they can't teach you how to think on your feet when your supply chain contact ghosts you in buenos aires or how to pivot a pitch when cultural context suddenly matters more than your data.

1qh32p7,https://i.redd.it/ymeip8jovaeg1.jpeg,Black Belt Weekend,"Twice a year (January and June) our dojo has black belt weekend. A four day long test for students to rank up to Black Belt, and appropriate dan levels. (junior black belts for the younger students). This year we had 32 people testing. One of the cool things about how we do tests is the fact that other schools in the area ask to test their black belts at our school because of how we structure it. This year we had 5 other schools testing at our dojo. 

Every test is different. Students are required to bring full gi, belt, and sparring gear. If they have weapons they can bring them, but we have them at the dojo too. They are also required to bring food for the instructors...kind of a fun tradition. If money is tight, or times are difficult, we don't force anyone to do it, and your promotion doesn't depend on if you bring coffee and donuts. 

I did not test, but was at the test as a Sensei. And I thoroughly enjoy the vibe of the dojo, and all the effort put out there by everyone. Friday, the testers meet at the dojo to clean, then Saturday is a 5 hour long test, and it's non stop. We're shouting commands at you left and right, no time for thinking, just doing, springing into action and applying what you've learned in a fast paced setting. Lots of sweat, some tears, and occasionally people will throw up. Your rest time is when the instructor is explaining what he or she wants you to do, and you might get two water breaks and 15 minutes around lunch. The instructors are looking at your every movement, and will call you out on anything and everything. We do it, not to be ""jerks"" but to see how you handle it, and if you can press forward.  

  
We drill pressure tested techniques and self defense grabs in realistic scenarios, weapons self defense (over head, side club, backhand club, and stabbing in club defenses), kali drills, kata, weapons kata, kihon basics (that aren't so basic), body conditioning, boxing drills, grappling, and tons of cardio. And when about 4 hours of a grueling workout has passed, and you're sweating, cramping up, and dizzy that's when you hear....""go get your sparring gear on.""  60 minutes of Full contact sparring. We do emphasize control when opponents are of varying size and age. 

  
Saturday night we have a banquet, this year was about 150 people. The testers get their ranks, and certificates/diplomas. They give out some awards and we dance and party. We don't have a banquet in June, but those who tested in June still get recognized at the banquet.

  
Then on Sunday is a 5 hour long seminar where my professor brings in high level instructors to teach a 60 minute section each. The Seminar is required for all those testing, but open to anybody with a willingness to learn, open to any student from any discipline with an open mind. 

  
Monday is regular black belt test where we do Shaolin Long Fist form, and close out the weekend. 

Pictured is one of our Shihan instructors. I believe he was yelling out ""If you have to throw up, make sure you do it in the bathroom, or outside, or else you will have to clean it up yourself""

Running a café is all about community — those regular faces that make the place feel alive. But between brewing, baking, and balancing costs, keeping customers coming back can still be tough.

That’s why I built **Loyal Customer** — a simple mobile app that helps cafés set up **digital loyalty programs** without any complex systems or hardware. Just use your phone and start rewarding your customers instantly.

With Loyal Customer, you can:

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

I see so many posts mentioning anxiety....  For me, ANY amount of caffeine (including ""decaffeinated"" coffee/tea) causes anxiety.   Dark chocolate almost always has the same effect too.   

I love coffee and black tea, and drank them for my whole life until perimenopause, but quitting them was truly one of the more life changing things I've ever done!  I know that if you're a coffee or tea drinker, the thought of quitting may seem crazy, but I'd encourage anyone struggling with anxiety to try truly quitting (no caffeinated or decaf products, no chocolate) for a few months.  r/decaf has lots of info and support about quitting.  

Maybe you learn that caffeine doesn't have any negative effects for you and you can happily resume drinking/consuming them.  Or maybe you realize that you're calmer and overall better off without them.  Everybody's body is different and unfortunately I've learned that mine is super sensitive to caffeine.

I checked the conversation and I don’t know what to make of it. This guy is being flirtatious with my partner with suggestive messaging and using 😉 and it’s put me a bit on edge. My partner isn’t feeding into it thankfully and he made X aware that we are together. My partner lives on his own at the moment so he feels lonely not knowing anyone in his local community but X makes me feel off. They have decided to meet for coffee at weekend, but I’m not sure if that’s the only thing. I wanted to see if my partner would be willing to tell me on his own about X but nothing. I asked about his weekend plans and he told me that he’ll think of something. I can’t help feeling that this is going in the wrong direction. My partner wants a friend in his area so he isn’t lonely which I completely understand but X doesn’t seem like he wants that.

There are no lovely old windmills, no cannabis-filled coffee shops and on a recent visit it was far too early for tulip season.

“When foreigners end up there, it is for one reason: to claim asylum at the Netherlands’ biggest refugee camp, home to 2,000 desperate people from all around the world.

“Some, like the Eritreans and Somalis, are fleeing war; the Syrians insist it remains unsafe for them to return home after the fall of Assad.

“But in the last year they have been joined by a curious new cohort: a bunch of Americans, who say they have feared for their lives ever since Donald Trump returned to the White House.

“Their presence has surprised many of the camp’s residents. ‘My dream is to go to America or the UK. America for me is the paradise,’ said Usama, a 21-year-old Libyan-Algerian hanging around the main gate. ‘You can work, you can make a million if you have a good idea. Why they come here?’

“It is a fair question. Last year, 76 Americans claimed asylum in the Netherlands, according to the Dutch asylum and immigration ministry, up from nine in 2024. Unlike the UK, the Netherlands does not rent out hotels or houses for asylum seekers, instead housing them in fenced-off camps, officially called reception centres, dotted around the country.

“Many of the American refugees, like Jane-Michelle Arc, a 47-year-old software engineer from San Francisco, are transgender. In April last year she flew into Schiphol airport in Amsterdam and, sobbing, asked a customs officer how to claim asylum. ‘And they laughed because: what’s this big dumb American doing here asking about asylum? And then they realised I was serious.’”",28,1768825769.0,transgender,0,0.97,False

I am searching for ground coffee in the north nazmibad area. I have already tried imtiaz, and kafiyah but could not find any. Does anyone know where I could find some ground coffee in the area? I have a French press but I am out of coffee :/

I even tried asking some of the cafes such as drop coffee and Melbrew but they didn't have any for sale. 

Just to clarify I am not looking for instant coffee.",1,1768825732.0,karachi,2,1.0,False
1qh2v1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartEvolution/comments/1qh2v1w/what_is_wholeness/,What is wholeness?,"Imagine a bicycle is wholeness. When you see a bicycle, you see it as a whole with its parts that make it up - tires, frame, pedals, brakes, seat, handlebars, chain, gears.

But where's the bicycle in all of this? Is the tire a bicycle? Is the chain a bicycle? Is the frame a bicycle?

What if I take apart the tires and brakes and frame from the bicycle..will it still be a cycle? 

So that means all parts are one with the cycle, right? But there's no thing as ""cycle"" itself - we call something a cycle when all the parts are arranged in a way that looks like a cycle.

And also, there's no cycle without a rider and the road too. The rider and the road are also part of the cycle.

Now let's look at the beautiful arrangement of what you call yourself.

The air you breathe in and out is part of you. The air you've been breathing has been in and out of countless beings on the planet.

Your blood running in your veins is water and is part of you. It has been part of rivers, clouds, someone's tears.

The food you eat like an apple  becomes part of your skin and cells. And that apple has been part of the tree. So you're one with the tree now.

The thoughts in your mind - the basic building blocks of language that make up words like tree, sky, bird, tomato - are the same thoughts everyone thinks. It's just that they arrange them differently in sentences and it becomes a different meaning and story.

Someone a thousand miles away is thinking ""I need to make coffee now,"" and you've also thought that at some point, or will later in the day. Like, we all think the same words, just in different configurations at different points.

The sun in the sky touching your skin - you're part of the sun. You know sometimes you stay in the sun for too long and it starts to burn your skin? That sun heat is now in you. ☀️

Like, you're not separate from anything.

If you want to see wholeness in parts, the most obvious clue is twins. They look the same. The only thing is they don't think the same thoughts. They have separate thoughts in their minds. And they're not engaging with the same universe all the time.

For example, if twin one is watching TV and twin two is riding a bike outside - different worlds, different scenes, right? 

Now imagine this scene..Two twins dressed up in the same clothes (outside wrapper is the same now). 

And they're both reading the same book, word for word simultaneously, and chewing gum at the same time (inside content - the reading words  is the same in their mind). And also the flavor of the chewing gum.

Aren't they now both the same inside and outside? Like two same TVs of the same brand with the same show playing (the book they're reading in the mind) and the same taste of gum in their mouth.

You can think of yourself in other beings too. Like you can think yourself in your dogs, cats, parrots, chickens. Like, whatever is looking through your cat's eyes is the same thing that's looking through your eyes. Like the same paper, but the writing is more complex in your mind compared to your cat's mind. 

What I'm trying to say is that without our wrappers of memories, preferences, desires, names - aren't we all the same candy made of the same chocolate. 

Like imagine you're Pepsi and I'm Coca-Cola.

Just packaging and brand is different. But we're all the same coke.

And you as Pepsi can mix into me as Coca-Cola in one glass. Then there's no Pepsi and Coca-Cola. And we say it's Coca-Cola, but it's not even Coca-Cola. It's actually water. And we say ""water"" as water, but that's a name we gave to water so we can understand we're talking about the same thing when we say water.

But nature itself doesn't have any language or names for the things we see.

So wholeness is hiding in parts. Don't see parts. See the whole.

""Wholeness is hiding in parts""

This sentence is complete and whole. But it looks like parts because there is space between words. Without space it would be like:

""Wholenessishidinginparts""

Separation isn't a bug. It's a necessary feature.

But you're not the words. You're the space in which the entire sentence - including all the words that appears. We all are the same space. But words aren't separate from the space. They might appear separate so the space can read the sentence.🙂

So you're the river as blood in your veins.

You're the tree and Earth as tomatoes and apples inside you.

You're the air as oxygen inside you.

You're the Sun as the warmth of sun rays on your skin.

You're one with everyone's mind and heart as the building blocks of language, and whatever you see and hear, feel, touch, and taste is the same as everyone.

We all are beautiful words that make up beautiful sentences that make up a beautiful story. One as a story. Separate as sentences.

But beyond the words, sentences, and stories, we are one space in which the entire story of the universe unfolds. One space in which galaxies, stars, your thoughts, someone's emotions, the meow of your cat appears.

We are one in many just like words in a sentence.

We are many in one just like words in a sentence.

And we are not even one, because if you erase the sentence then there's only space left, which isn't a sentence.

And what is space?

Not a word, not a story. But a potential for words and stories to appear. 🙂 ",1,1768825705.0,HeartEvolution,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Not in a sad way exactly, more like, life got busy and it felt safer to blend in. Jeans, bun, whatever. Last weekend I found an old lipstick I used to love, this loud berry color, and on a whim I put it on before running errands. Immediately I had that tiny panic like, oh no, everyone’s gonna stare. But then something super unexpected happened. The first person to react was a woman in the grocery store who did a little double take and then said, “That color is PERFECT on you.” Not the forced compliment vibe, like she meant it. I laughed and said thanks, and I swear my shoulders went down two inches. Later, a barista (also a woman) handed me my coffee and went “ok yes, main character lip!” and we both cracked up. Then an older woman in the elevator at my building smiled at me and said it reminded her of a shade she wore in the 80s and how she missed it. None of these were big conversations, just these tiny human moments, but it felt like a chain reaction.



It made me realize how often women quietly hype each other up in ways that actually matter. Like we’re all walking around carrying a bunch of invisible stuff and then someone just  tosses you a little light. I’ve had plenty of days where I’m the one complimenting someone’s nails or their haircut because I know how it lands, but I never really noticed how much I needed it back until now. I came home and looked in the mirror and instead of picking myself apart, I just thought, wow, I look like me again. And the funniest part is, I don’t even think it was about lipstick. It was about being seen kindly, without it turning into a competition or a comment that feels gross. I wore it again the next day, even when I didn’t “have to,” and I felt more present in my own skin. Anyway, if you ever hesitate before giving a compliment to another woman because you think it’s corny, do it. It can genuinely change someone’s whole day, apparently including mine.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I went through six interview stages, did a full project demo for the senior team, and even had a casual coffee chat with the department head. They were giving me all the reassuring hints, saying things like we can really see you working here' and telling me I was 'definitely their top candidate.  
  
Then, of course, the very standard rejection email landed in my inbox. The classic we've decided to move forward with another candidate line. I replied asking for any feedback, you know, to improve for next time. Nothing. They ghosted me.  
I was at my breaking point. So this past weekend, I went on an application spree. I'm talking about 72 straight hours of applying to anything that looked even remotely related to my field. I think I sent out applications for about 120 jobs. I tailored my CV for about 60 of the more important ones, but the rest were just quick, rapid fire applications. I hit all the major job sites  LinkedIn, Glassdoor, you name it.  
Honestly, the crazy part is that this method worked. I've already got 5 calls with recruiters scheduled for this week.

This time it was her frustration about how she wanted us to join her goodbye dinner as a whole family for her brother’s wife. She says that the tradition is to go as a whole family and not like separate couples. The family is viewed as one unit, and it’s respectful to come as one, not individually. This goes the same for when visiting for a family member’s birthday, a dinner. It is the family that’s invited, not the couple.

She said she do doesn’t care how it happens in my family, how my siblings do this and that each has their own culture; that I knew ‘how things are done’ in her family before marrying her son. By marrying her son, I joined his family, this is my ‘new family’ and it comes with its expectations/traditions etc.

Shes previously hinted as naming our child when it comes to that because its tradition.. and changing my name to a more religious one. She still has me named as her ideal name on her phone.

Prior to getting married she once told me if I wear the wedding dress I choose, she would not invite her family because it’s embarrassing.

She’d want us to do mother daughter things, go out on coffee dates together etc and build relationship outside of her husband, communicate directly to her not through him etc

She also wants to teach us how things are done so we can pass the traditions on.

For more context, prior to this, she had expectations of being a dutiful daughter in law, who organises things - the social glue. To dress traditionally around the house + when visiting her family. (While keeping an eye and commenting on my clothing if I’m not modest enough) accompany her shopping, doctor’s appointments, running errands etc. This is what her daughters do and essentially she gained me as a new daughter. At the moment we live with them, so dinners were expected to be eaten together during the week, breakfast together every weekend. On top of this, going out with the whole family every weekend + visiting extended family once a week. I work full time + some weekends so the very little time I have left, I want to either spend alone to recharge or with my husband to maintain our relationship.

Since then, we have slowly placed our boundaries and I simply didn’t follow expectations I found unreasonable. I became more reserved and protective with my time and identity. Had dinners together some days a week, dinner and breakfast dates outside of the house, saying no to most of the family events they hold. I let my husband go as he pleases to his family’s events and I only join sometimes.

when I started placing boundaries, they felt like I didn’t integrate into the family, that their relationship with their son is more distant as they don’t do things together as they used to. In my view this is a natural consequence of getting married.

She has since come to reason with me and said she has let things go and understands I don’t want to join her on every errand, every event, every dinner etc. She understands that I work full time and are more reserved as a character. But just wants effort, a close relationship and traditions passed on.

Hubby and I argued so much to make it happen, and now that 75% of them are gone, I’m like… relieved but angry. why were my requests so unreasonable and taboo when I first asked for them. It’s soured my view of MIL and everyone’s asking me to look past it and move forward and she keeps asking to have a close relationship.

TDLR: MIL expects full and adherence to her family tradition, placing multiple expectations as how I should be as a DIL. From clothing, to family event planning, dinners together every day, family outings every week. I remained firm in my boundaries and while expectations have reduced, she still wants a closer relationship together and more integration.",40,1768825297.0,JUSTNOMIL,12,0.98,False
