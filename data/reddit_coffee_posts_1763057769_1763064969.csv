Every visit to the ER with an ekg has resulted in sinus arrhythmia, and holter monitors never showed much either. I started wearing a fitbit charge 5, an old one my brother had from 4 years ago to see if the ecg function would help. Drank some coffee today and was sitting an hour after on the carpet where I noticed the Fitbit showed my HR was 105. I felt my pulse in my wrist and it definitely felt more like 65. I was confused since I wasn't feeling symptoms, so I ran the ecg function and low and behold, it said afib with a 56 BPM HR. I got scared, so I sat up and ran the ecg again 4 more times after. All came back normal sinus rhythm, and my HR showed 65. Now I'm a little worried and wondering if I should attribute this to a watch error or the possibility that maybe I did just have a very brief paroxysmal afib episode.

Which do you guys think is more likely? Technical error, or afib? Do these watches have history of giving false positives? \[Side note, I have a kardia being delivered this Monday. Hoping for the best\]",1,1763064802.0,AFIB,0,1.0,False

My partner wants to be part of my hobbies, but I resent his presence there","Hey, need an opinion. I'm a menopausal woman and haven't been feeling 100% even keeled emotionally, so just putting that out there before I start my rant... 

I've been ballroom dancing for close to 20 years, since before I met my now partner of 17 years. When we met, he wanted to come to classes but quickly lost interest. I carried on, and since about 10 years ago, I've slowly formed a really nice, solid group of friends in my dance class who I see mainly in class and also occasionally at weekends when there's a social dancing evening. My partner is not jealous and he's always encouraged me to go, knowing it makes me happy, which is great. I've also always encouraged his hobbies and social life, but therein lies the problem: he has slowly just stopped having any friends or staying in touch with anyone, or going to football or doing anything.

He now has one friend he meets about 3 times for a year for coffee. He has a big family who we both meet around once a month, they're lovely people, and he sometimes goes to see them on his own. 

That's his social life, and I've gently asked him sometimes whether he thinks he should try to be better at maintaining friendships, and he says he should, but then doesn't.

My social life is full, I've always made a lot of effort with girl friends (outside the dancing circles), plus dancing other hobbies like art classes etc. We recently adopted a dog and I've joined a dog training class and we do occasional treks to nature at weekends.

Then 2 months ago, my partner has suddenly expressed interest in joining me dancing, so he joined my dance class. He remembers a bit of dancing from all those years ago when he went with me for a year or so, so he was ok to join the mixed level class I go to. And I was so happy for him to, 8 felt it was sweet he wanted to do something with me.

Then, he said he wanted to come to the social dances - and that's where the problems started for me. 

He won't dance with anyone else except me, saying he's not good enough, and he also doesn't make any effort to chat to anyone. I nudged him about it after a couple of weekends, first nicely and subtly, then a directly, but he keeps laughing saying he's really shy and he just joined so he could dance with me. 

Last weekend he insisted on joining me at a dance workshop that was for advanced level. I questioned his a few times, saying I wasn't sure he'd enjoy it, but he insisted. Then, on the day, he found it hard, and then afterwards was literally was glued to me, wanting to chat or dance with me all the time  - the etiquette of social dancing is that everyone dances with everyone but again he brushed off asking other people to dance saying just he's so bad at it. Aaaaaargh!!!! Even when I'm describing it, it's driving me insane.

I guess what's making me so angry is that I've spent 20 years cultivating my skills, and 10 years forming my lovely friend group. This hobby is a major vent for me, to really relax and forget everything for a bit. Dance is something I'm wildly passionate about. I feel like he's just missing the point, trampling all over my territory, taking away something I love and generally just being very lazy with not making any effort with dancing with others or talking with others. So all the pressure of his presence is on me, when I'm doing the one hobby I enjoy so much.

Am I selfish? I literally don't know right now if I'm just being incredibly self centred and mean, or does anyone else see this as problematic?

The last straw was that he recently told me he wants to join my dog walking class too and ""drop in occasionally"" or come to the weekend walks. I don't want him to as I know he'll isolate me from others by clinging to my arms nd only taking to me, and I'm too kind to just walk off and leave him on his own with him not having anyone to talk to.

Like I said in the beginning, I'm menopausal and I am noticing myself being less accommodating with people. How do I handle this with grace, not say something that hurts? How do i place clear boundaries? Or am I just going to have to tell him nicely but clearly that I don't want him there?

I guess I feel that it's not fair he's just walking into my ""ready set up"" of friends. Like, I went through all that effort of getting to know people, and the discomfort of being the new person in the group (I'm shy with new people too), but I wanted to create those new friendships because I feel it's worth it. I feel like he wants me to pave the way, and then just waltz in (pardon the  pun) and reap all the benefits of being ""out"" and socialising, but not actually taking any emotional risks himself or putting in any effort. 

Sorry the long post. Please help. I feel like I'm suffocating. But maybe I'm just a bitch who won't support my partner? Let me know.",1,1763064133.0,AITAH,11,0.67,False

My husband and I are lifelong Southerners (Georgia and NC, but live in TN now) who are moving to Vermont for his job (medical provider). Most of my family is from the Boston area, and I grew up in PA as a kid, so I have very minimal experience with the NE - but have never as an adult experienced the worst parts of winter here. Unfortunately, my husband will be moving to the greater Burlington area about 5 months before me (I have to finish my last semester of school and get the house ready to be sold) and will be experiencing the worst of the winter by himself. We’ve already been doing tons of research to make sure we winterize his car, get him snow tires, and he’s going to hit up Lenny’s (or somewhere similar) to get a heavier coat and snow boots before he starts his job.

While thinking about Christmas, I want to get him some things that will be of great use to him while he’s experiencing his first Vermont winter. I’m thinking about grabbing him a pair of Darn Tough socks and a nice BIFL coffee maker, but I want to see if there are any things that people on this sub have purchased that turned out to be more useful or helpful than you would have expected, or little things you use every day that make your life easier. Again, we’re both Southerners. We have zero experience with this type of severe winter (our snows in TN amount to no more than 3-7 inches at a time). So even something you think is basic or obvious probably wouldn’t even occur to us.

**Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams (One with Injuries, the Other with Confidence)**  
The Los Angeles Kings (-118) are the chalk here, and for good reason: they’re healthy, have a balanced attack, and aren’t dealing with the Maple Leafs’ injury crisis. But let’s not let logic ruin the fun. The Maple Leafs (-102) are underdogs, yet their 3.6 goals per game (third in the NHL) and a power play that’s as reliable as a Netflix password make them dangerous. Meanwhile, the Kings’ 2.9 goals per game? That’s the NHL equivalent of a slow drip—present but forgettable.

The over/under is set at 6 goals, but the math screams “OVER 6.7 GOALS” like a sleep-deprived analyst. Toronto has exceeded 6 goals in *every* game this season, while the Kings have done so in 9 of 13. Their combined average? 6.5 goals per game—0.5 above the line. If this game were a popcorn machine, it’d be the one that explodes.

**Digest the News: The Maple Leafs Are Playing with House Money (and a House Fire)**  
The Leafs are currently fielding a roster that looks like a “Where’s Waldo?” for healthy players. Key absences include **Christopher Tanev** (out with an upper-body injury—probably not a vampire bite) and **Auston Matthews** (day-to-day, likely practicing yoga to stay flexible). Anthony Stolarz is day-to-day too, which means Darcy Kuemper gets the start. Kuemper’s 2.4 GAA is solid, but the Leafs’ defense? Well, they allow 3.8 goals per game. It’s like a sieve that’s also on fire.

The Kings, meanwhile, are as healthy as a vegan at a salad bar. No injuries, no drama, just a team that’s 6-2-2 in their last 10 games. Their top line of Adrian Kempe, Quinton Byfield, and Anze Kopitar is as reliable as your morning coffee—

Unfortunately, my husband will be moving to the greater Burlington area about 5 months before me (I have to finish my last semester of school and get the house ready to be sold) and will be experiencing the worst of the winter by himself. We’ve already been doing tons of research to make sure we winterize his car, get him snow tires, and he’s going to hit up Lenny’s (or somewhere similar) to get a heavier coat and snow boots before he starts his job. 

While thinking about Christmas, I want to get him some things that will be of great use to him while he’s experiencing his first Vermont winter. I’m thinking about grabbing him a pair of Darn Tough socks and a nice BIFL coffee maker, but I want to see if there are any things that people on this sub have purchased that turned out to be more useful or helpful than you would have expected, or little things you use every day that make your life easier. Again, we’re both Southerners. We have zero experience with this type of severe winter (our snows in TN amount to no more than 3-7 inches at a time). So even something you think is basic or obvious probably wouldn’t even occur to us. 

For budget, i would say no single item over $100.

1owb0tg,https://www.reddit.com/r/gastricsleeve/comments/1owb0tg/1_year_anniversary/,1 Year Anniversary,"Hello all! 

Today is my one year anniversary since my gastric sleeve, so I thought I'd give a snapshot of the journey since there are a lot of lurkers questioning if they want to do it as well.

As of today, I'm down 90lbs

\- Eating about 70g protein a day

\- I'm not tracking calories closely, I weigh my food. I can handle about 3.5-4 oz 

I will say that I've had a pretty breezy year.

\- Recovery was pretty smooth, not a lot of pain (but plenty tired)

\- No issues with water intake, even while in the hospital

\- I've never thrown up or experienced dumping syndrome 

\- I've been able to tolerate everything I've eaten, including the not-so-approved options

\- I had a period of increased hair shedding but no major hair loss (I really focused on my protein and vitamins) 

\- Cold - I've always been cold natured so no changes there 

\- Downsides: Occasional minor heartburn, butt and boobs gone, I can no longer play ""dead weight"" with my husband because he can just pick me up

\- Loose skin? Not really, I suspect I will have someon my arms, but I hope to minimize it with exercise. Givne I have a tattoo sleeve, I likely wouldn't have skin removed, anyway. I am concerned I'll have some on thighs, as well, but we'll see how it goes.

Overall, I can say enough what this surgery has done for me. Until a year ago, I didn't understand the concept of ""full."" I grew up thinking that full = about to throw up. And I ALWAYS thought about food. I craved sweets all the time. Even the smallest tummy grumble sent me into a panic of ""I must eat now!"" 

Now, I recognize what my limits are. I do have some cravings, but I've been in therapy to work on the mental aspects as well as how my ADHD plays into things. Best of all, I'm fine walking past the candy and cookies. I don't feel like I'm missing out if I don't have it. That's not to say I haven't had a donut or a sugary coffee, because I certainly have, but I can give myself that inch without taking a mile. I can tell myself ""Hey, you had that sweet treat and now it's time to adjust."" And I do. I do thins because I know with my history of disordered eating, absolute restriction will send me back into binge habits. I'm assuming this what people who never had issues with their weight do lol

I'm still working on realizing I've lost the weight I have. I started cleaning out my closet to donate things that don't fit, which turns out to be A LOT. I've ordered clothes that are way too big because I still don't have a solid sense of my new body. I sitll thought I wasn't going to fit in an airplane seat, or I can't get up from the floor easily.   
  
My physical/emotional/mental life has improved in so many ways, and there are some old habits and thoughts that resurface, but I finally feel in control and I know I can handle the challenges that arise without always running to food. 

As long as you're willing to put in the work and don't allow yourself to get too comfortable, you'll succeed! ",4,1763063427.0,gastricsleeve,0,1.0,False

I have a 2017 iPad Pro that is slowing down and freezing, so it is time for a replacement. I’m looking at the 1TB iPad Pro and I’m unsure if the nano-texture option makes sense for me. Here is how I plan to use it:

• I mostly use my iPad indoors at night after work while I’m in bed. I use it to watch movies, read, and occasionally draw.  
• I do not have a personal laptop. I only have a work MacBook that I prefer to keep separate. I also have a 2019 Mac for work and video editing that still runs well.  
• This new iPad will be my on-the-go laptop substitute for writing, journaling, and light productivity with a keyboard.  
• I might take it to a coffee shop occasionally, but that will not be the primary use case.

Since I’ll mostly be using it indoors at night, I’m unsure if the nano-texture is the right choice. I’ve heard that the reduced light diffusion indoors makes it close to standard glass. If that is true, I would lean toward nano because I’m already getting the 1TB model and the extra hundred dollars is not a concern. My only hesitation is whether the nano finish  reduces quality when watching movies or reading, which are my main uses.

Long story short, I'm in medical school and have been on academic probation for 4 months because I have yet to take my board exam. All I have to do is realistically buckle down for 5 days and study really hard and I know I would be ready for it. All I need to do is just *take the stupid test.* But for four months, I've been going to the library, to coffee shops, or just sitting at my desk in my room and doing anything but the teeny tiny sprint of studying I need to do to get this behind me. I've been kicked off my school's health insurance because I'm technically not even enrolled for the fall semester, financial aid has been emailing me nonstop asking if I even plan on returning, and worst of all, my parents don't even know this is going on because I'm so ashamed to tell them that I've spent every day for the past 4 months messing around on TikTok and Reddit. I've reorganized my closet. I've deep cleaned my bathroom. I've probably sold  like 30 items on Poshmark. I've read about 10 novels during this period. I have created entire Pinterest boards for things I plan on doing once this exam is over. And yet. I can't just sprint for 5 days and take this damn thing. 

I feel so desperate I even thought about hiring someone to just sit behind me and make I work and don't open a new tab to frantically online shop or doomscroll. This test has been such a burden on me and I feel so ashamed by how simple the solution is. It's embarrassing how this whole situation is my own doing and I can't even get myself out of it. I wake up every day feeling so determined to get a head start on this, but I always waver \~40 minutes in and the day is out of my hands. My friends and boyfriend are so sick of me and don't even check in about how it's going because it has literally never taken anyone this long to get this done. I really thought about just biting the bullet and taking it this Saturday, but failing this thing would be a huge detriment to residency. More so than the glaring academic probation that will be on my transcript. I most likely will not be counted as a student for this  Fall 2025 semester. 

If anyone has advice for what I can do, please let me know. I'm willing to try anything. I have a lot on the line and for some reason that isn't making me budge.  

TLDR: I'm a med student on academic probation because I still haven’t taken my board exam. I only need about 5 focused days to be ready, but for 4 months I’ve procrastinated by scrolling, reading, organizing, doing anything but studying. Now I’ve lost school insurance, financial aid is hounding me, my parents don’t know, my friends are done with me, and I’m drowning in shame. I keep promising myself I’ll start but never follow through, and I’m terrified of both failing the test and continuing to do nothing.",1,1763063394.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

A week ago, I purchased a Profitec Go. Everything was great, I read the instructions carefully, set up the espresso, and everything seemed fine. A week has passed, and today I noticed that the pressure during shot doesn't rise above 5-6 bar. After 5-7 seconds, the coffee starts flowing, the pressure rises to about 5-6 bar, and after you turn off the button, the pressure suddenly jumps to 9 bar. The coffee, grind (I used 14 and 15 on DF64) dosage (18.5-18.7g), and everything else haven’t changed (earlier everything was fine, the pressure would rise to 9 bar after 10-11 seconds, as it was adjusted initially). I thought the grind might be too coarse, but with a finer grind, the same problem occurs. I inserted a blind filter, and with it the pressure rises to 9 bar after 5-7 seconds, as it should. I'm really confused about what might be the problem, honestly. Is this issue related to the dialing and my coffee grind, or could something be wrong with the machine itself? And how can this problem be resolved? Any info would be much appreciated.",1,1763063375.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

I do very well for being a younger, single mama in my first few years in this crazy industry and I attribute that to my coffee shop management positions on Bainbridge in my earlier years and the sphere and relationships that stemmed from my work and the trust that has been built through these.

My big question is - how do I get people to stop just googling “real estate agents on Bainbridge Island” and working with the person who pays the most for advertising. How do I get people to search for someone that they actually like instead of using the person their parents used just “because”. I’m so tired of losing on listing appointments because my name isn’t as “big” and I don’t spend thousands on marketing myself. I’d rather spend that money marketing your property, anyways…

I’m just wondering what people are looking for, really. What do you want from your real estate agents other than expensive photos and marketing that literally anyone can do/pay for?

Everyone is a real estate agent, and everyone can sell a house pretty easily seeing as homes and technology sell themselves these days.

Finally got around to make my little coffee corner aesthetic and would love to hear what you think about the setup :)

I’ve been drinking filter coffee for a couple of years, but about six months ago I came across specialty coffee. So, I ordered a couple of pour overs bags from Fraction9 just to see what the hype was about and that was the start of this new obsession.

For a long time, I was only brewing with a South Indian filter. Recently picked up an AeroPress and a Timemore C3S grinder, and this combo pretty much became my daily ritual. Although I only have one cup a day occasionally two.

I also bought a moka pot (cheap one from iBell), but it never brewed anything great so it’s mostly sitting there as decor at this point haha

Would love to know your AP recipes, bean recommendations or what do you think should be the next addition for this setup.

Here's what worked for me and what didnt.,"I feel like most people just tell me to eat less when it comes to losing weight. I literally hated it. So here is what I actually did to lose 112 lbs.

1. Don’t overload yourself with fiber or foods your body just can’t break down. I learned this the hard way. I basically lived on the toilet for a while. BTW not fun. Tons of diets will preach “eat endless lettuce” “snack on peas all day” or “go nuts with corn.” If you do that, your digestive system is going to go into literal overdrive. Sure, the average person carries around 3 to 8 pounds of uhhh waste and yes bathroom reading time is productive, but you’ve got a life outside that porcelain throne.
2. Lettuce? Honestly, it’s the biggest scam in the veggie world. If you want greens, eat the ones that do something for you like spinach for iron, kale and bok choy for all that nutrient goodness, collards and Swiss chard for all the minerals your body actually needs. Lettuce is basically crunchy water with a side of fiber. Throw some Swiss chard on your sandwich. Stir-fry some bok choy.
3. This one I don’t hear alot of.. Log your weight with progress pictures everyday. Like I would look back from previous months and when I would see “12 lbs lost this month” I would be so fired up to keep on going. Holding yourself accountable is so important guys trust me I quit like 10 times before I actually did it. The app I personally used for this or I think the only one you can do this on is called “Jurney” on the app store not sure if its that popular but I saw it on a tiktok.
4. Drink… but don’t DRINK you feel me? A glass of something after a long day can help you relax, and that’s genuinely good for your health. Some alcohol even has small benefits (I am not a doctor btw) antioxidants in wine, vodka killing germs, bourbon helping a cold. And alcohol loosens you up physically, which might be why your grandma who drank like a pirate made it to 97. But once you go past “a little” you’re suddenly chugging calories and your self-control goes flying out the window. My always drunk professor once said, “For every drink you think you drank, there were three you didn’t think you drank… and that’s why you can’t remember what you drank.” Honestly, she mayyyybe was right.
5. Smoking wrecks your cardio and so does dirty air. I don’t smoke, but I dropped about 40 pounds after moving away from a smoker and into a place where the air didn’t feel like soup. I started doing my cardio at the gym instead of outside because, shocker, it's easier to exercise when you can breathe.
6. As for sports, here’s the deal: swimming an hour burns roughly 400 calories, and running for an hour burns about 300. But grinding out laps or running in a circle for 60 straight minutes? Pure torture. Some people live for running good for them. I’m not one of those people. But can I run during a two-hour soccer game? Yep. Can I do a hundred accidental squats during volleyball? Definitely. Can I work my triceps rowing across a lake while pretending I’m in a nature documentary? Absolutely. It’s exercise without the suffering.
7. Start now. Stop waiting for the “perfect moment.” Want to go to the beach? Go. Want to wear a crop top? Wear it. I used to think everyone would stare, whisper, and judge the whole nightmare scenario. That’s how high school was for me. And yeah, when I started wearing bikinis as an adult, a few kids still made comments. But way more people either said something nice or didn’t care at all. Turns out, I was just another human being, not a billboard begging for insults.
8. Here’s another thing: most green foods have almost no calories. The exception? Avocados. Those things are tiny calorie bombs coated in fat and somehow manage to taste like enchanted ogre mucus unless they’re in guac. Meanwhile, mint chocolate chip ice cream also green absolutely has zero calories. Don’t argue with me it’s literally science I made up.
9. Stop putting your life on hold. Don’t wait to “get skinny” before getting a haircut or buying clothes you love. Stop delaying being happy.
10. Lastly, sleep is sacred. So if anyone finds you napping in the grass after stretching at the park, just tell them you’re prioritizing recovery. And accept their coffee money with gratitude.

1owaqp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/1owaqp3/athlete_surgery_was_the_best_decision/,(athlete) Surgery was the best decision!,"I was stressed about recovery after reading about others' experiences, so I wanted to share my own to offer some optimism to athletes deciding whether or not to make the leap.

**TL;DR** I (24F) was unsure about a second laparoscopic surgery for endo (concerned about recovery, felt I could push it off), but it went exceptionally well. Recovery was a breeze, and my body feels amazing! Pre-hab was key!!

**Background**: I had my first lap in 2023 to address irregular and painful periods. Was diagnosed with Stage IV endo and dermoid tumor (cyst) on one ovary. Both were excised. Recovery was tough—had a bladder infection, shingles, and abdominal discomfort. I was overly cautious with post-op ab work, which backfired when I returned to rowing 8 months later and quickly injured my back by overcompensating for weak abs.

Endo symptoms creeped back in over the next couple years, which brings us the present. Surgeon scheduled me on account general pelvic pain, bad period cramps, and severe constipation. Additionally, for the last year, I've had persistent hip flexor/adductor pain and injuries, with general abdominal discomfort while working out (running and cycling; some rowing and pilates. Always needed extensive warm-up and activations, but excersise-induced hip/abdonimal pain would flare especially bad during Week 3 of my cycle). I wondered if this was related to the endo, and it seems it was.

Since it had only been 2 years since my last surgery, I was reticent to go under again. Ultimately, I decided to chance it now rather than wait for more damage to be done to my insides. Also, the constipation was so bad for the last couple months that no amount of senna, dulcolax, running, coffee, fibre, or magnesium could inspire a normal BM.

Well, I had my operation three weeks ago and I'm feeling fantastic. I believe that the prep I did going into the surgery seriously helped.

**Preparation:**

1. I ate really well, slept enough, and avoided stress for the month before.
2. I got plugged into Pelvic PT a month before the surgery. They did fascial massage and pelvic release so my abdomen would be relaxed and pliable headed in to surgery. I also continued seeing my acupuncturist who works hormonal meridians.
3. I made sure my abs were in good shape. I was a casual pilates consumer, but when I started considering the surgery this summer, I committed to pilates or core work 2x week, and pushing myself in order to have a strong core going in.
4. I kept working out and responsibly upping my training load until the week before, at which point I went really light. Was told by my PT that you don't want to be in an inflammatory/recovery state headed in to surgery.
5. I discussed my reactions to previous surgery meds with the anesthesiologist. Last time, I was nauseous and in serious pain when I came to, so we preempted the nausea with a scopolamine patch which was applied when I checked in for surgery, and I was administered extra pain meds when they woke me up. I think kicking the pain cycle before it could start helped me in recovery because once I got home, I only took acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and for just four days.

**Results**: Surgery went exceptionally well. I came home lucid and walking, and was already itching to jog the next day. Surgeon diagnosed me with Stage II this time, and found adhesions on my bowel and the side where much of my hip and core pain was occurring.

I went for 30-90 min daily walks on Days 2-10 post-op, at which point the Dr. cleared me for light cardio.(Side note: I was really fatigued Days 3-6, until I realized that I needed A LOT of protein. Once I started eating far more calories than I thought I needed, my energy came back). On Day 10, ran a Z1 mile and it felt great. Abs were a little tender after, but no pain. On Day 14, I ran 3 x 1 mile in Z2/Z3 and hot dog! oh my gosh! I didn't realize how ""stuck"" my insides had felt before the operation! I cycled 10 miles in Z2 the next day, 35 miles in Z3 on Day 16, and ran 3 miles in Z2 on Day 17. It's incredible. I'm just so glad I did the surgery.

I'm backing off a bit this week (gonna stick to Z2...i.e. the ""light cardio"" I was cleared for lol), but I'm set to return to pilates and ab work on Day 28, and rowing/lifting soon after. Feeling so grateful for my surgeon, my body, and my village!

Athletes: think about getting surgery!

additional note on scars: at the post-op appt, my surgeon thought my scars were looking really good. I believe they're doing well thanks to a microcurrent scar treatment I started on Day 6.

Husband doesn’t get it,"7 weeks pp. typing this with one hand as a desperate cry for help. I am ebf and on mat leave. my husband also on leave. he thinks handling the odd diaper and being “on” from 10pm-2am (the window baby mostly sleeps) is him busting his ass to help. he sleeps in to 930/10 am most days, then wakes up and gets his coffee and is out for one or two hours. then he’ll come home and reorganize furniture or do some sort of home prohect. usually run more errands. baby only contact naps during day. idk what to do anymore. can’t stop crying. I have  ppd and lack of help AND being alone all day is worsening it. I don’t even eat meals or hydrate, what free time I have is washing bottles or pump parts or throwing a snack into my mouth so I don’t die. I am so sad. nothing gets through to my husband. He also vapes and is not allowed to vape in the house so will often go outside to vape then have to change his clothes etc., so it’s a convenient excuse/another thing that constantly gets him away.

  
to make matters worse I def do more financially. we split rent 5050 but all other bills are on me. I also buy all of my baby’s clothes diapers etc. I even spent $5k on an overnight doula I fully paid for hoping to make my life easier - it’s only helped him bc she comes from 10-6, he sleeps in,  I still get up to feed etc.",1,1763062668.0,beyondthebump,3,1.0,False

1owan9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Weightlosstechniques/comments/1owan9v/112_lbs_weight_loss_in_1_year_heres_what_worked/,112 lbs weight loss in 1 year. Here's what worked for me and what didnt.,"I feel like most people just tell me to eat less when it comes to losing weight. I literally hated it. So here is what I actually did to lose 112 lbs.

1. Don’t overload yourself with fiber or foods your body just can’t break down. I learned this the hard way. I basically lived on the toilet for a while. BTW not fun. Tons of diets will preach “eat endless lettuce” “snack on peas all day” or “go nuts with corn.” If you do that, your digestive system is going to go into literal overdrive. Sure, the average person carries around 3 to 8 pounds of uhhh waste and yes bathroom reading time is productive, but you’ve got a life outside that porcelain throne.
2. Lettuce? Honestly, it’s the biggest scam in the veggie world. If you want greens, eat the ones that do something for you like spinach for iron, kale and bok choy for all that nutrient goodness, collards and Swiss chard for all the minerals your body actually needs. Lettuce is basically crunchy water with a side of fiber. Throw some Swiss chard on your sandwich. Stir-fry some bok choy.
3. This one I don’t hear alot of.. Log your weight with progress pictures everyday. Like I would look back from previous months and when I would see “12 lbs lost this month” I would be so fired up to keep on going. Holding yourself accountable is so important guys trust me I quit like 10 times before I actually did it. The app I personally used for this or I think the only one you can do this on is called “Jurney” on the app store not sure if its that popular but I saw it on a tiktok.
4. Drink… but don’t DRINK you feel me? A glass of something after a long day can help you relax, and that’s genuinely good for your health. Some alcohol even has small benefits (I am not a doctor btw) antioxidants in wine, vodka killing germs, bourbon helping a cold. And alcohol loosens you up physically, which might be why your grandma who drank like a pirate made it to 97. But once you go past “a little” you’re suddenly chugging calories and your self-control goes flying out the window. My always drunk professor once said, “For every drink you think you drank, there were three you didn’t think you drank… and that’s why you can’t remember what you drank.” Honestly, she mayyyybe was right.
5. Smoking wrecks your cardio and so does dirty air. I don’t smoke, but I dropped about 40 pounds after moving away from a smoker and into a place where the air didn’t feel like soup. I started doing my cardio at the gym instead of outside because, shocker, it's easier to exercise when you can breathe.
6. As for sports, here’s the deal: swimming an hour burns roughly 400 calories, and running for an hour burns about 300. But grinding out laps or running in a circle for 60 straight minutes? Pure torture. Some people live for running good for them. I’m not one of those people. But can I run during a two-hour soccer game? Yep. Can I do a hundred accidental squats during volleyball? Definitely. Can I work my triceps rowing across a lake while pretending I’m in a nature documentary? Absolutely. It’s exercise without the suffering.
7. Start now. Stop waiting for the “perfect moment.” Want to go to the beach? Go. Want to wear a crop top? Wear it. I used to think everyone would stare, whisper, and judge the whole nightmare scenario. That’s how high school was for me. And yeah, when I started wearing bikinis as an adult, a few kids still made comments. But way more people either said something nice or didn’t care at all. Turns out, I was just another human being, not a billboard begging for insults.
8. Here’s another thing: most green foods have almost no calories. The exception? Avocados. Those things are tiny calorie bombs coated in fat and somehow manage to taste like enchanted ogre mucus unless they’re in guac. Meanwhile, mint chocolate chip ice cream also green absolutely has zero calories. Don’t argue with me it’s literally science I made up.
9. Stop putting your life on hold. Don’t wait to “get skinny” before getting a haircut or buying clothes you love. Stop delaying being happy.
10. Lastly, sleep is sacred. So if anyone finds you napping in the grass after stretching at the park, just tell them you’re prioritizing recovery. And accept their coffee money with gratitude.

I hope this helps guys!",7,1763062560.0,Weightlosstechniques,0,0.82,False

I (27F) am looking for some suggestions for managing POTS symptoms in my girlfriend, (29 years old, MtF trans). She got a preliminary diagnosis after a particularly bad episode that sent her to the ER and is awaiting an appointment with her PCP to actually get the proper diagnostic tests done. In the meantime, we have done some research into good ways to manage her symptoms. Here are some things she does daily now:

-Drink 2-4+ bottles (16.9 fl oz each) of water daily

-Have salty snacks on hand at all times

-Take salt tablets at least once daily and as needed additionally

-Eat high fiber meals (which she has done historically already due to digestive issues)

-Stretch at least once a day

-Limit caffeine intake (she used to be a frequent energy drink consumer but has tapered off to maybe a cup or two of coffee in the morning, usually alongside a good filling meal)

Despite our best efforts, she has still had a seriously tough time ever since the episode that landed her in the ER. It feels like the most random things can set off her symptoms. She tends to have ""mini episodes"" multiple times a week, if not daily.

Factors we are aware of that could potentially exacerbate her symptoms:

-She is iron-deficient anemic (takes an iron supplement, however it could be that it needs to be adjusted)

-She takes a dosage of spironolactone as part of HRT (I have heard spiro is a sodium and water diuretic)

-She has a mostly sedentary lifestyle due to disability/chronic illness

-She has always been rather underweight due to a high metabolism as well as poverty in the past

To be clear, she has an appointment with her PCP and is seeking actual medical diagnosis and treatment for this, but I am just looking for some tips and tricks that could help in the meantime. Thanks so much!",3,1763062514.0,POTS,9,1.0,False

like nothing's truly \*wrong\* wrong.. everything's kind of hard but i'm sure a lot of people are in that same boat. and i'm just so unhappy with it all.   
my kids don't \[really\] respect me, but they're kids, and i'm trying to break this cycle of like ""respect over everything"" that my parents were so insistent on. does it really matter/ how can i make them be more respectful without being the mouth-foaming belligerent creep my parents were? can i just not give a shit/ how?

we are struggling so hard financially. i'm trying to find a job, i've been looking for over a year. and with every passing month we get further behind and it makes me feel terrible. i want to be financially sound, i want to be able to buy gifts for my kids, i can't even go through the coffee shop drive through for myself because i feel so guilty.   
  
my husband seems to be cruising the internet. posting weird comments on threads, saying inappropriate sex-coded shit on forums that \[i hope\] he would never actually say in real life. i know he doesn't cheat because he genuinely doesn't have time/ alone time, but how does he think sexual things are acceptable to say to others? i don't want to leave him, i don't want him separated from our sons, but i just wish i could scare him enough to make him stop thinking or saying anything sexual to/ about someone who isn't me.   
i think that i can't. i think it wouldn't make a difference to him, and that makes my chest hurt. 

i guess i feel deceived because i thought/ hoped he had gotten this shit out of his system before we started even dating. and then a few days ago i found out he had told some random on the internet ""i wouldn't date you, but i'd \[fill in the blank sex comment\]."" i confronted him about it and all i got in response was ""i don't remember saying that"".. like.. does that matter in the slightest? not the fact that you legitimately told someone ""i would do this to you"", and openly on the internet; but the fact that 'you don't remember' is supposed to mean something to me? you're not viscerally disgusted that even though you didn't meet up with someone/ insert anything anywhere, you still chose to speak inappropriately to a stranger/ someone who is very definitely not your wife? 

he's a good person. he's a present partner. we've had a hard couple of years and weathered them together-- i thought. he's not abusive, not mean, he's very rarely indifferent, he's good with our kids and genuinely loves being a father. but this ongoing compulsion to say off-the-wall sexual shit to strangers (that's never been responded to, as far as i can tell) is making me question everything regarding how i feel about him. does he love me, did he ever, and if he did/ does, how can he say the things he said?   
  
i'm living in a state i never wanted to come back to. we lived in the mountains for a year and a half and i was so happy there. i made friends, there were things to do and cool places to see. intelligent discourse was abundant, and i felt truly heard and seen by the women i met during that time. then we moved back to this red-state hellhole where the median IQ raised only slightly with our presence. i had a hard time making friends when i lived here before, and that doesn't seem to have changed much. i align heavily lib/ dem/ blue. given the issues that have been made political in the last decade or so and the way the other half has handled them with mockery, name calling and cruelty, i don't really see an ""agree to disagree"" scenario and/ or friendships emerging from that. so i just feel pretty lonely. luckily my very best friend whom i left behind in the mountains, is very good about lifting my spirits and i cannot wait to see her in just a couple short weeks for thanksgiving. 

i'm living with unmedicated AuDHD and anxiety. i don't have health insurance since my husband changed jobs/ we moved this spring, so i'm just mainlining all these feelings and impulses with no ability to get medicated for them. constantly overstimulated and doing my level best to not blame my kids/ hold them hostage with my feelings. struggling between hyperfixation and executive dysfunction. 

right now i have one ear that just.. doesn't work. voices don't register in that ear, but the whoosh of a HVAC fan on top of a building is loud and fucking clear. my other ear works, but not great. i think this is related to the sinus pressure/ pain i've been having for a week or so. i hope it changes soon and i can go back to just.. hearing normally. while i've never doubted how different a Deaf person's life would be from mine, i have been truly flabbergasted by how different/ strange everything is with only one working ear. 

a couple weeks ago my mother was here at my house. there is a bedroom that we keep shut currently because it's just not safe for my little ones to wander around in. too many moving boxes/ hazards for my under-1 and 2y/o to be around. i got up in the morning to check on my school-aged kids getting ready, and i saw that that bedroom door was standing open, so i shut it and drew the lock across. apparently my mother had been in it, and she looked at me with venom in her eyes and said ""i love that you just fuck up everything i do.' at 5:20 AM. i blinked a couple times, decided it was too early and i was too uncaffeinated to engage with this shit, and took my ass back to bed. and she never brought it back up/ apologized/ said anything else. personally i don't know what to say and so i haven't. but she's being nicey-nice lately and i just want to say hey mom, remember a few weeks ago at 5:20 AM when you told me i fuck up everything you do? it's implanted on my mind like a fucking brand, thanks ma. 

i feel so unwanted. genuinely unloved. i feel like i want to go home and i don't have anything/one/where that feels like home. i'm sure it's a combination of absolutely everything. stress and bills and my overworked nervous system and this sword-of-damocles feeling regarding the conversation i am surely going to have to have with my husband. i'm currently sobbing onto my infant's head and i feel so pathetic. i need this ""surviving"" season to pass. i want to thrive. i need good feelings.

I don't know if there's anything anyone can tell me to finally help and get rid fo this issue but I thought I would try.
(Bc I've tried seeking lots of help from researching online & people in my life's advices).

For context:
I'm currently a junior in highschool and my biggest goals are academic. I work on the weekend and fridays, other than that everyday after school I'm studying. I can only study at coffee shops and libraries (I don't even wanna go into that rn) and I take all AP classes. I feel like I can handle the rigor but due to my ADHD things take a super long time for me so I'm spending from 3pm-9pm everyday after school studying most days. Is this insane?? Luckily I genuinely love to study and I love learning but I feel like it's bad for my body but that's besides the point. I still struggle a lot with 2 things that I've always struggled with and can't seem to figure out. ONE: Going to bed at a good time & TWO: Waking up on time

I know where it all stems from but I just can never fix it. Basically I don't know if anyone else relates, but I have to feel like certain things are done for me to go to bed. First of all my room HAS to be tidy before I do anything (getting ready for bed or school work). Second, I have to be done with chores & other tasks. Third, I have to go wash my face & brush my teeth. For some reason this simple list of things will cause my executive dysfunction to go insane and if I can't make myself do them (Btw I take Vyvanse and by this time it usually runs out) I genuinely cannot let myself sleep and I will procrastinate and stay up all night. Obv this affects everything in my life negatively, and I often am late to school ALL THE TIME. Every year in highschool I have been late and missed entire periods. And another reason is I often skip school to finish homework. Luckily my school doesn't care about attendence if you make good grades, but it causes my work load to be a never ending bad cycle and I feel like I'm disrespecting my teachers and overall just being a failure. People don't understand though how hard it is for me to make myself wake up in the morning or just get something done to go to bed on time. It's so rough idk what to do. I bought an alarm clock maybe that will help? I literally had a friend tell me buying an alarm clock won't help and that it's a personal problem at this point so idk. 
*Also by the way I try really hard to set timers & alarms but my time management & time blindness is always so tough for me and when I don't do it how I want I give up and it really discourages me because I feel like I never do things in a decent time
*Also I have tried being off social media for weeks and not using my phone but honestly I'm still gonna have executive dysfunction or poor time management either way I've realized 

But yeah I feel like these issues end up being the biggest source of all problems in my life. 
Thanks so much if you took the time to read this let me know if anyone relates or has some advice or insight!! Thanks again!!",2,1763061964.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I got a few questions, I'm visiting Seoul for 3 short days as a side-trip. I'm a big overplanner that likes to make sense of the routes we take but what with Naver not working very well in my current country it's been a bit of a hassle so here goes:

\- We're visiting in February because it's the only time we can, I read that Korea/Seoul is even colder than Japan during this time so... did we shoot ourselves in the foot? Will the streets still be lively and fun for nightlife? Or does nightlife shut down during the winter?

Take train to Gwangjang Market and wander Myeongdong and Euljiro.

!!! This is my biggest issue, I've been hearing a lot of bad things about Gwangjang but I chose this route because it seems hassle-free and close to each other...do you guys have any alternatives? or do you think this route is still ok for short time visitors and worth it?

to breathe the thin air and feel alive —
to wake up in a tent where clouds drift like soft ghosts outside the flap.

I want to wander through every Schengen country,
not as a tourist, but as two souls chasing wonder.
To sip coffee in small towns, to miss trains,
to laugh at the rain, to live without counting days.

I don’t even care that they (only sometimes) buy me a coffee or snack or whatever as gratitude. It’s inconvenient and I’m so over it. You’re a grown adult find your way to the location. Especially when they’re in opposite directions from our destination. 

It’s so inconvenient for me and I don’t believe I should be punished for having a car even when they have access to a car and they just make the choice of not getting a license. One of them said he never bothered to get a license because he never needs it, but that’s he automatically thinks I’ll always drive him. And then my friends that refer to themselves as passenger princesses like it’s cute…how is being dependent on others a valuable, “cute” trait. 

Gimme a break. Gas is a pain in the ass. I’ve probably spent 3 full tanks alone on picking up one of them. All those miles add up 😭 I am so tired of it. And this is not a dig at people without a license, as I have a friend who doesn’t drive but he has never asked for a ride and is completely fine and accustomed to public transit, (which, in the city I’m in, is fairly accessible).

Now I'm in post-wedding mode and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for re-selling items.

I know that the colored glass look is in right now, so I'm thinking I'll have some interest and would love to help another local bride out.

Would it be worth doing an ""everything must go"" garage sale type thing? I'm thinking of having a big sale in the spring some time, but I'm not sure the best way to get the word out. Let me know, because I'd hate to bring all of this stuff to a Goodwill where they will undoubtedly mark it up like crazy.

Where I'm located: Luck, WI (About an hour north of Minneapolis)

Things that I need to sell: About a hundred various colored glass drinking goblets, white and off white drapes, burnt orange colored napkins, assorted gold/brass center pieces, assorted metal lanterns, some couches and ottomans, wisteria hanging chandeliers, bulk coffee cups, and lots of other single items.

My doctor talked me into another cholesterol test, and I talked her into a thyroid panel, as I've heard hypothyroidism can cause elevated cholesterol and triglycerides (as per Dr. Bright in videos I've been binge-watching...). My main hypothyroid symptom would be hair and eyebrow thinning, which I honestly don't think I had until AFTER I started supplementing iodine (which I've also heard can happen, per Dr. Bright).

For context, I started carnivore Feb 2025, started iodine March 2025, noticed hair thinning/shedding starting around Summer 2025, and stopped iodine September 2025, hoping things would work themselves out (as hair thinning didn't stop, and still hasn't). I decided to test my blood for the first time since August 2024 (right before I started lowering carbs and eating higher fat) in November 2025 (see my first post for more info). After the results (see last post), my dr wanted to retest.

Here are my second round of lab results \[taken 11/11/2025 - I fasted for 14 hours and maybe 10 minutes; I never drink coffee\]:

https://preview.redd.it/382m976ltt0g1.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b79d93bcfdb43d09521dcba24b1d6bfc17cddad



They also checked Lipoprotein (A) and it was 28.4 nmol/L

\[to which my doctor responded, ""your lipoprotein a is normal-which means your cholesterol is not hereditary.  Please continue the medication follow-up with me in 3 months please make an appointment to see cardiology""\]

So far I only have these thyroid results, but I believe we also checked a couple other markers. Unfortunately they didn't do a very extensive thyroid panel:

FREE T4: 1.23 ng/dl (middle of range)

TOTAL T3: 63 ng/dl (low end of normal)

Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies: 15 \[iU\]/ml (mid range, should it be 0?)

I'm obviously most concerned about the triglycerides because most high-fat diet promoters say that it's not likely an issue as long as you have a good triglycerides to HDL ratio (close to 1 or less, and at least less than 2; mine is 5.7), and that the LDL is not problematic, can be protective, is usually the ""large, fluffy"" type, etc.

I know I shouldn't be getting health advice from Reddit. My doctor prescribed Crestor and Tricor, (which I won't take, but I didn't tell her that). I just don't know what else to do. Will it help to take iodine again? Am I eating too much fat? Too much protein? Too much in general? Not exercising enough? I don't hear anyone talking about this, besides Dr. Bright, and since I did use the iodine, maybe it threw off my thyroid? Could this possibly be ""fat toxicity/lipotoxicity?""

(My thesis is on this so any insights would be great :))

Take Game 7 of the World Series as a recent example. I’m in Toronto, and for a minute it felt like the whole city or even the whole country was breathing in sync. For some people, it was their first time really watching baseball for others, it was just another game. But for everyone, it felt like a shared national moment. I saw people crammed into bars, and public squares just to watch history. I made eye contact with someone in the same jersey as me i'd never met before and instantly felt like we understood each other. It wasn’t just about “watching a game,” it felt like participating in something bigger and collective.

That’s what I find so fascinating: sports can temporarily dissolve so many barriers. Culture, language, race, gender, age, even politics for a second. When an athlete wears the maple leaf and steps onto a global stage, we cheer hard. (the olympic effect if you will). It feels like we are winning. It’s pride, identity, and belonging all rolled into one.

But here’s where I get stuck:

Why does that feeling end the moment the game is over?

Why does that solidarity evaporate as soon as the score resets and everyone goes back to their own separate lives?

If we’re clearly capable of that kind of shared pride and empathy of caring about strangers just because we’re “on the same side” for one night why don’t we carry more of that into our everyday lives? Why is it so rare to feel that same sense of connection on, say, the subway, or at a coffee shop, or literally walking down the street?

1owa4ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1owa4ug/making_friends/,Making friends,"I’m hoping for some advice on something I’ve been struggling with lately. I’m in the UK (not far from London), and I’ve realised that as an adult, it’s surprisingly hard to make new friends — especially when you’re just looking for a normal, non-romantic, and non-sexual friendship.
I’m an introvert and also have social anxiety, which makes it even more difficult to approach new people or put myself out there. I’d really like to meet people to hang out with — grab a coffee, go for walks, explore London, chat about life, or check out museums and markets. But most social apps seem so focused on dating, and it feels awkward trying to meet people when your only goal is genuine friendship.
Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you go about making friends while being an introvert with social anxiety? Are there any groups, or local activities you’d recommend?",1,1763061389.0,trans,1,1.0,False

I never thought I had it because I’m not hyperactive, but I realized via talking to my psychiatrist that things like zoning out while driving (which has led to several car wrecks), not being able to pay attention in meetings at work, and constantly getting “stuck” throughout the day (like knowing that I have things to get done but I simply can’t) are symptoms of adhd.

I’m now trying medication but I’ve found dextroamphetamine-amphetamine (i.e. Adderall) and dextroamphetamine (i.e. Dexedrine) make me feel extremely wired. My friends with adhd say their medication “quiets” their brains. But I’m on a low dose and, while it is absolutely helping me actually go throughout my day, I feel like I’ve had three cups of coffee. Is it possible that I don’t have adhd? Or, have some people with adhd reacted similarly but found something that actually worked? ",2,1763061165.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False

I use both the brand’s own app and the general delivery apps that have different restaurants and cafes. Yesterday, I got a “we missed you” notif from one of the café’s own apps, it came with a 20% off reward. Of course, I went ahead and redeemed it right away.

It just made me realize how effective these brand-specific apps can be compared to general delivery ones. Like, the personalized offers actually make me want to go back. As a customer, it feels kinda nice,more rewarding, I guess. Makes me think it’s worth using the cafe’s own app if you really love a brand. Even if it’s another app that’s taking up space on my phone, lol.

I guess that’s the trade-off is more apps, but better rewards. Curious though, do you guys actually use brand-specific apps for stuff like this, or do you just stick to the big delivery platforms?",1,1763061128.0,PerksCrew,0,1.0,False

1ow9zro,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ow9zro/perspective_on_my_recent_relationship_and_breakup/,Perspective on my recent relationship and breakup,"Hello, first of all a warning that this is a very long post, and I'm not sure if it's appropriate. I have recently broken up with a girl I was incredibly in love with. 2 weeks ago to be precise. The whole relationship lasted just 2 months, but it was incredibly intense and gave me some of the best feelings of my life. I felt so alive and motivated, fuelled by immense love to do anything and everything for this woman as well as to be the best version of myself. I not just imagined the rest of my life with her, but was actively turning it into reality.

I am very much still grieving the loss of that relationship and the vision of my life. I am quite broken, joyless and struggling day to day. I am going to therapy once a week, which I had started already during the relationship. I don't have a specific set of questions for you, I wanted to share my story perhaps just to help myself out, perhaps get some compassion, or perhaps so that someone else's perspective reveals some blinds spots for me. Honestly, any thoughts you'd share with me I'd appreciate. I am very much lost as to what I want from life now, as well as what to do / what I should do to feel better and be better. I am running on hope that my subconsciousness is with time doing what it has to to get back on track, because my consciousness is very much blocked, barely able to get on with basic daily tasks.

I'll try to give a factual rundown of how things went and provide as a side some of my feelings that arose in certain situations.

* Our first meet
   * We met on an online dating app, and she lived in a different country. She was also married and in the process of getting a divorce, still living with her husband. We got on a video call and talked for about an hour. I didn't feel like she was very interested in me but I liked her. We kept texting over the next days and I decided that I'll ask her out properly, fly to her city and spend the weekend there. She agreed and I planned a full day on Saturday. We met in the morning, I picked her up near her place with the rented car and flowers, went for a drive and got to a coffee place. Conversation was great, we talked about psychology, everything was flowing and nice. We then went on to a spa, you'll probably think it's a weird first date idea, but honestly it was amazing overall, but when we got to the sauna we also got naked next to each other after a couple hours of meeting. That was a bit nerve racking but after that everything was great. We were relaxing, talking, getting to know each other, talking about how great it is to meet. We liked each other and I kissed her later on. It felt like we are already close to each other. After the spa I took her to a nice restaurant I booked for us. Dinner was great, we had fun, went back to the car, drove back, kiss goodnight, goodbye. I am leaving the next day. The next morning we text a bit and I ask if she'd like to get some coffee, and we meet for coffee. We have a nice time but it feels a bit concerning. In the end I tell her I like her, but I am not sure how much she likes me. She says that with her current situation with the marriage not working out she's at a low point but she has gone through the process of grief and everything, accepted it and is moving forward. She has to take it slow and be careful. I understand. I go back and on the way back I am both happy and concerned.
   * Between there and 2nd meet, we are texting and calling more and more. We are talking about ourselves, she starts saying things how she never met anyone like me, and how her feelings developing for me are very new to her. Anyway we are getting closer and closer and the amazing feelings of love are starting to develop. I am motivated to play music and get in touch with my creative side, more motivated to work, to start a business etc. I start thinking about her night and day.
* Our second meet
   * I decide it's time to spend time with her again, this time for longer. I plan to stay 10 days in her city, renting an apartment. We meet on Friday I arrive, she's working late and I meet her at her office and we go out for drinks. It goes terribly, I am shook by seeing her I guess, I feel very uninteresting, don't know what to talk about, it's very very awkward. I have no confidence to even touch her. We talk about travelling and she travelled a lot. All over the world. This makes me more uncomfortable, she is saying things like how she went out and met people etc. Including my country where she said she met some 2 guys that were very tall and big and how they made her feel tiny next to them and shows me the photo. I don't know what to say, I guess I'm pretending to be unphased by it. Anyway, the awkwardness continues throughout the night with some tiny glimpses of something. She says things like ""what's going on? where did your game go?"". At some point, we call it a night, head to my car and have a long passionate kiss in the car. I take her home and drive myself home. I feel terrible when I get back, have nightmares that night, something about seeing her not liking me and seeing her with someone else.
   * I wake up the next morning and the plan is to take her to a candlelight concert tonight, with dinner before. We talk during the day and things lighten up compared to last night. I'm going to speed up a bit. I pick her up, we have dinner, things are okayish. We go to the concert. It's great, I feel like we are getting back on track, I whisper sweet things to her, she responds well etc. After the concert, I take her to a cocktail bar. We get a drink, sit down, talk on a deeper level, it's good, I tell her my intentions which at that point are serious relationship with her, and that I want my future with her. Received well. We go to my place, have sex, after sex we are lying next to each other. In my opinion sex was great, but it seems something is wrong. I ask and she says she's used to a different shape and size of the penis. Weirdly it doesn't bother me immediately, I think because I was so confident that sex was great. But it feels like she is almost crying, she reveals how everything was perfect with me so far and that she set her expectations too high for this part as well and somehow set her self up for disappointment.
   * The next day, that thing starts bothering me, we go out for coffee after I made breakfast for us at home. I tell her it bothers me what she said and that it's a problem. She says that based on sex alone she would not continue this relationship but because she already has feeling for me she will. I think it's a very weird thing to hear for something that's supposed to make me feel better. We walk, talk, go to lunch, and eventually I start feeling better. I say ""we'll figure this sex thing out"". We get home, have sex again, she finishes on top and says ""hey we figured the sex thing out"". Great, everything is lovely. All the rest of the week we are together while working in coworking offices. Most of the nights she stays with me.
   * On one evening, we stay home and talk more. She wants me to ask her questions because she doesn't feel like I am getting to know her or that I don't want to get to know her and that I am not telling her things like whether I noticed some ""icks"" about her. She says I surely must have and that I don't want to share them. I feel weird, like I'm being put in a weird position - I don't feel like saying anything that I noticed about her that I don't like because there is nothing and I start questioning myself whether I am not observant enough and what I am supposed to act like, think like and what questions I need to ask. She says that as soon as something bothers me, I must say it and hold nothing in. Anyway, I come up with a list of question from simple and easy, funny to deeper stuff. We talk and have a good connection, eventually she is sitting on me face to face and I tell her I love her. She smiles very warmly and hugs me and starts crying after a while. We hold on to that moment for a long time. She reveals that it was like a burden off her heart, while at the same time she felt some anger because ""where was I all this time, why did she have to go through all the shit she did before meeting me"". She says she never felt what she feels for me.
   * On one day, when driving home from dinner, she asks if I would be less attracted to her if she got fat. I don't know what to say, so I try to answer honestly and say that if she gained a lot of weight I would probably feel less attracted to her but that it would really have to be a lot of weight. It is not taken well, she shuts down, is upset, and I am trying to say stuff to make it better but it seems there's nothing I can do. We get home, she doesn't want to get close, hug or kiss, but she smiles seemingly condescendingly to my face as she pulls away. We get to bed and I try talking to her more but she does not reply. I say something like I know you're tired of me tonight so I'll just say I love you and my attraction to you is not mandated by your physical appearance. I turn away but I notice her twitching for a while and I turn back, comforting her with touches. She starts crying and reveals how she took it as my love for her is conditional and that she doesn't care about the physical because she is looking for someone for her whole life and it's great if I have a great body but it's not the important thing. Okay, next day we wake up and everything seems reset to normal and great. We have sex, breakfast, go to work, etc.
   * On one of our dates, I mention I have a friend in one city and that I'd like to visit him. She said she loves that city, that she had her best date in that city. Crushing. I can't understand why she'd say that. She sees it bothers me and says how she's just used to telling that story that way, as in in her mind it's just labelled best date but of course the ones with me are better. I accept it but it continues to bother me.
   * The last night before my departure I took her to a theatre to see ballet. It's nice, we enjoy it and talk. Afterwards, we need to get to the car and I am a bit distracted between talking to her and figuring out the way to the garage etc. We get to the garage and I notice she is upset. We were going to the car for her to change heels to shoes and go to dinner, we were talking about whether to take the car somewhere or just find something here. When we get to the car I ask so what are we doing, should we take the car or not. She snaps at me as in we said we'll just stay here, where are we gonna park if we go, she responds rudely. I tell her hey I just asked a question, no need to talk to me like that. In that moment, I feel like, you know, I am organising all these things for us and this seems unfair from her side. Anyway, when I instantly told her that it bothered me as she told me to do, it made things worse. She says, of course you only care about your feelings and ego instead of focusing on my feelings first since I am upset first, you should take care of that firstly. It's awkward from there, she storms out, opens doors on her own and we somehow get to a restaurant for dinner. She tells me how I don't have the emotional capacity to lead conflict resolution. And that I don't know what to say and I shut down when things get hard. Well, she's right. I really do not know what to say in these situations, but I'm not sure the situation is fair. When I try to say or do something, it seems to be shut down or met with no response. So I have no response either, and it seems that no matter what I try to say or do, it will all go the same way - not right. Not what she wants me to say, i.e. I don't understand her fully, and I should know better what she's feeling and thinking. If I ask directly, she doesn't want to tell me because she's tired of explaining and wants me to pick up on things. Anyway, it feels very similar to the night of the fat question, we get home, bed, but no sex in the morning. We have to get up early though because she has a flight in the morning as well. I take her to the airport, kiss, I love you I love you. My flight back is later that day. I go back with conflicting thoughts and feelings. My journal talks about how many different and strong emotions I felt in these 10 days, like a roller-coaster. I call my mom for a bit at the airport and tell her that it was nice but that there are times when she is upset and I don't know what to say to make it better.
* Our third meet
   * We plan a trip together now, I fly to her country and we rent an airbnb out in a nearby city to live there for a month. It is extremely turbulent throughout. I would summarise it as very tiring, 24/7 doubting myself whether I said or did something wrong. I will give some examples but it's hard to put everything to words, there was so much that happened I have to skip a lot. In my call with my therapist who at this point knows all of the above, I ask him how do I look? He says terrible, like I've been to war for a week. One of the more disturbing things for me was early in the trip at dinner, we talked about previous drug use, she mentioned she did cocaine a couple of times. I ask when was the last time and she says actually this March, she went out, met some guys in a bar, did cocaine with one of them in the bathroom. I tell her that this is a very disturbing image to hear, especially because at that time her marriage was basically just at the start and her reasoning for going out that night is because things were not working out and she was dealing with a lot. I think okay but it's quite obvious that this is not the right thing to do, I try to tell her her that. I try to get her to say that she was wrong for doing that. Does not go well, she says I don't understand what she went through and that she doesn't have any regrets about it. So I ask more about what she went through in her marriage and it comes down to the guy being an avoidant personality, not working on himself, not cuddling her at night, not trying to fix their problems. Weird, but okay, I try to accept it, but it does come up a couple of days later when we get to talking about her marriage again and I try to get more of the husband's perspective, so for example, she never told him she did that cocaine night. She eventually explodes as she feels that I am not on her side and why should I even care about what the guy said or thought I should only care about her and she thinks I don't believe her. She says she's not the right person for me if I expect her to say that she was wrong about doing cocaine in a bar bathroom with some guy while having marriage problems.
   * Another example is when on the final day before going back, she asks me about my casual dating history which we mentioned before, I said I only did it in one instance on a trip. She asks more about that and I tell her there were 2 girls I saw in that period with just casual intentions, she makes a huge deal about how I said one instance but there were two girls. I meant as in one instance of the period of the trip, she took at as it was just one girl but since there were two, I am a liar among other things. She asks if I liked it, and I say that it was nice, I provide the context of recently going through a breakup before that and that it felt nice to be wanted by a woman. It does not go well, she says how can I like the experience of it, when I said I don't like casual dating and that I think it's not good for a person. I am a hypocrite. So I turn it around on her a bit, I ask did she like her experiences which are very extensive. She says she cannot even remember because she doesn't allow those thoughts in her mind because what she feels for me is on a totally different level and she thought I was on her level but I am actually much below her level. Okay, I keep pushing and she admits to having enjoyed sex with her previous partners as in ""yeah, sure, it was good"". Okay, I ask more about how many people she was with that way, she says 40-50. Whatever, I never wanted to find this out anyway, but I already accepted her past. I knew she did casual dating much more than I did, I didn't want to concern myself with numbers but ended up there somehow anyway. Things are not good between us but we sit down for a beer and somehow reconnect very strongly. We go home and have probably the best sex we had. After that, we are in the bathroom, she is in the shower and I hesitate to join her in there, I'm not sure why. Kind of just mesmerised by the recent sex and don't know if to impose or not, so I don't. She gets out of the shower and I immediately see something is wrong - ""why didn't you join me?"". We are not on the same level thing again. I cannot understand how we can feel so close one minute, and so far away the next because I didn't join her in the shower. I wish she would have just voiced an invite, I would not hesitate at all. But okay, that's how it is, it gets worse and worse, I try to say the right things but nothing works, she goes to sleep on the couch. I come to her to convince her to come back to bed once, nope. I go back a bit later, I try again, and I carry her to bed. Next day I take her to her house and go back.
* 4th meet
   * That same day I dropped her off she messages me, and it feels eerie. She wants to talk to me tomorrow. Okay, tomorrow we don't get on a call because I'm busy and it's too late. But we talk the next day, she says how when she got home her husband packed her things and told her to leave. Eventually he switched up and things got emotional and they were crying together. He kissed her, and she pushed him back but with a delay. Not nice to hear, I don't know what to think but okay, I go to bed.
   * Next morning, she says she hasn't told me everything and she wants to come clean. She writes a very long message about how what happened confirmed her feelings for me and how she is totally over her husband now and everything is confirmed for her. It feels like a victory for her. She says that what happened was very brief but did get physical at some point. So I have to play detective - what is physical? - It means it got sexual. What does sexual mean? It means he was inside of me. Great... She says it was just 5 seconds and that she avoided the word sex because it was not sex for her. It was her trauma response to freeze and her mind was thinking of me all the time but her body gave up. She says in those 5 seconds the guy already came, she went to take a shower and cried. I tell her I'll take some time and get back to her but that I feel manipulated with the way she revealed this and that I had to keep digging for the truth.
   * Next day, I get on a call with her and tell her that I don't see a way forward. That it's over. She cries and wants to do everything to fix it. She says she will fly to my city the next evening and wants me to see her. I tell her that it's futile, I will not get over this especially because I did not see it coming at all since from the start her position was that she is totally over with the marriage, just the divorce needs to be finalised.
   * Anyway, she does come to my city and I meet her. She can't stop smiling when seeing my face and it takes a while to even start talking. We go to my place and talk, I appreciate that she's here but what now? How to fix this? I don't see a way and she says that she doesn't either but that her coming here, love and all that, with time we can work through it. I ask questions, clarification of details. I ask how it could have happened without her consent, where were her underwear, doesn't she have to be wet etc. Quite uncomfortable for both of us. She reveals that the act was actually he started rubbing against her in bed, and they eventually rolled over so she was on top of him during the sex. I think in my mind, that's so much worse - I try to imagine how can you grab a woman and put her on top of yourself so easily without her participation, as she is saying she was like a corpse during this. Anyway, she cannot handle these questions and storms out.
   * The next morning, she sends me recorded calls with her husband. After she told him about me, he encouraged her to go see me and try to fix it. And in the call, she told him how I asked these questions and how she thought I'd understand her trauma and feelings around what happened but I was actually concerned about the details of the act. The guy says that asking these questions I asked is not normal, that I am insecure and immature, that my hurt is understandable but my dealing with it is crazy. That if I am as perfect as she claimed so much, that I would understand and appreciate her coming to me. I feel so weird, like it's both of them against me now. Okay whatever, I go see her at her airbnb, we talk, we cry, we have sex, I bring her back home. When I do, I'm so torn apart. I love this woman, but I am haunted by these thoughts. She cheated on me, yet I should not think of it that way at least according to her. This goes on, I bring something up, she storms out, she comes back, roller-coaster all over the place. I don't know who's crazier at this point, me, her or her husband. Anyway, this up and down goes on for a couple of days. I'm trying very hard and there's a lot of crying and good and bad emotions but overall it's very very bleak most of the time, even when I feel a bit closer to her again. On one day, after my therapist appointment, she says she cannot deal with my indecisiveness, but I cannot give her the confidence she needs. She says she has done and said everything she could, and since it doesn't seem enough from my side, she storms out. It's over and I don't hear from her again.",2,1763061068.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I count what’s left in seasons now,  
forty summers, if I’m lucky,  
folded like linen in a drawer  
that closes softer each year.  
The air has thinned around my youth;  
time no longer ambles.  
It runs its fingers through my hair  
and whispers, you’re next.  
  
Days once sprawled like fields, endless,  
where afternoons could nap inside themselves,  
and I’d wake still young enough  
to think nothing was ever lost.  
Now the light slips quicker through the blinds,  
and mornings arrive  
already half-spent.  
  
I move slower through the world,  
but the world moves faster through me.  
Leaves dissolve before they fall,  
conversations taper mid-thought,  
the calendar turns like a wheel  
with no hand on the brake.  
Even laughter feels urgent now,  
like a bird startled from a branch  
too thin to hold it twice.  
  
I measure my life  
in sun-warmed moments—  
coffee cooling beside unread pages,  
a friend’s voice bending the air,  
the long inhale before an apology.  
Each one a currency I spend  
without saving for the winter.  
  
Forty summers left, perhaps fewer.  
I do not bargain.  
I tend my small fire,  
walk barefoot through the soft grass of what remains.  
I name the stars I can still see,  
knowing they’ve already burned out  
long before their light reached me.  
Maybe that’s the trick,  
to shine even after you’ve gone.  
  
And when the last summer comes,  
as it must, quietly, without ceremony,  
I will greet it the way I once did  
the end of a long day at the lake:  
skin salted, heart wide,  
the sun bowing low behind the trees.  
  
Autumn will follow, faithful as ever,  
brushing gold across the tired green.  
I will not fight it.  
The air will cool and I’ll remember  
the boy I was—  
barefoot, unhurried,  
trusting the world to go on without him.  
And it will.  
  
But for now,  
the sun is still warm.  
I step into it,  
count to forty,  
and begin again.",1,1763061001.0,poetry_critics,0,1.0,False

1ow9xuw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ow9xuw,Living Room Floor Plan Help (please and thank you),"Hi, I have an awkward nook in my apartment that I have no idea what to do with. My living room is currently laid out where the TV is against the window wall, which I am open to changing.

Nook Dimensions • Depth: 41"" • Width: 59.5""

Some ideas I've considered • expandable dining table • reading nook with a chair • bookshelf • art work with a table underneath • armoire (which I am leaning towards)

Also, trying to add a dining table but the space is really awkward. Theoretically I would have the dining table next to the shoe bench but it seems weird to be sitting next to but we only have one real wall for it. To be fair, the shoe bench we want is enclosed and has doors, unlike the one in the picture. Again, I was considering putting it in the nook but I feel like it would feel really claustrophobic.

For a little more context, my roommate just moved and my boyfriend is planning on moving in, in a few months when his lease is up so there are some changes anticipated like the coffee table, couch, TV stand, and we may have an extra armchair (but this could also go into another room), so I'm also concerned about the space feeling too cluttered.

I've included some photos of the space and screenshots are some mockups I made in the IKEA app of some of the main options I'm considering.

I am completely open to any and all suggestions!

I do what I can to make delicious coffee, but I keep things pretty basic (which entails buying the best affordable beans that I can and grinding them with a simple electric grinder). One day, I had an issue with my cheap drip coffee maker and needed an alternate option. This is my makeshift pour over contraption. It is a mesh cuisinart strainer topped with a regular drip coffee filter. I use a very short and stubby kettle, not elegant or precise. I fill up the strainer/filter, wait for it to start draining, add more water, and repeat until I have enough coffee. To me, it tastes pretty good. It’s now my primary way of making coffee. I thought about buying a pour over coffee maker of some sort, but this seems to work! I don’t know why it works because I’ve heard so many people say that with a lot of pour overs, you have to play around with how it’s poured, and results can vary.

Back in July I told her I kept getting the feeling I was being strangled in my throat and after a month of this she ordered an endoscopy. She found gastritis and the mild beginnings of esophagitis and suggested that i most likely have LPR. This was based on the conclusion that I never get any 'classic' symptoms of reflux like heartburn.

Anyway, she immediately put me on 80mg of PPI a day to try and heal the gastritis (and thus calm down the LPR) and that was an absolute nightmare. I had the worst neurological side effects of my life and stopped them after only three days. She tried having me take Pepcid which also started causing not only muscle twitching, but depression.

So now I'm at a loss. I've changed to a very strict low acid and low fat diet with no carbonated drinks or coffee. And yet I constantly feel everything, even plain water, coming up my throat.

Literally the ONLY symptoms I have is a constant tight throat and the anxiety it gives me is off the charts. I found this sub and everyone who's healed has done so by combining diet with PPI/H2 blockers and I feel disheartened that I can't.

I've worked here for 5 years. And while i probably should have kept things separately washed, its shared laundry in our building so its not cost effective to do so when I'm doing mine and my s/o's laundry

What can i use to help eliminate odor in each wash cycle going forward? My s/o has sensitive skin so I've been only adding vinegar to the wash with tide simply. And dry with bounce dryer sheets.

I'm not sure what i can use to help at this point, but I've noticed laundry that has sat folded starts to get this very faint, old milk smell on them from mixing my aprons in with laundry. Its front load washers (if that makes a difference?)

Also not sure whats pet safe as we have a dog too so i don't want to also harm him either!

Thank you in advance 😭 ❤️",1,1763060616.0,laundry,5,1.0,False

I've been having some trouble with my father these last few weeks and I would like some imput on that. For starters, he's 68, naturally slim and mixed race, smoker since 12 and was healthy as a bull until it all started. 

Well, about a month ago, he started to complain about lower back pain, enough to keep him awake at night, but that went away completely with over the counter painkillers. That went about two weeks until it subsided, but then he started to complain about his upper abdomen, saying that sometimes it would cramp and hurt and last for about 5 minutes then go away. That was once or twice a day. It was worrying enough that his appetite plummeted, a man always known as a big eater was eating half a fillet of chicken and a spoonful of rice, at most. 

Come this Monday (November 10th), he went to get checked. Did blood test, all normal except for a little elevated white cell count (13k something, as opposed to the 11k max). Urine test came negative to bilirubin, glucose and the likes. Doctor checked his pulse and lungs, all normal. Gave him an IV with Buscopan and when he came home, he was brand new. Never felt better. 

The next morning, he woke up, made his coffee and his blood pressure went down fast. He had to lay down because he was feeling dizzy ans his whole body felt heavy. He took the day off, barely slept due to concern, and woke up yesterday barely speaking, whole body fatigue (enough that he couldn't shave). Took him to another hospital, showed the exams to doctor, she re-checked his pulse and breathing, all normal except for glucose levels at 170 after a meal. 

Dock said it was too early to say what could it be, suggested a check up and gave him another IV with Dipyrone. He came home walking, we live in a very steep climb, and he did that without losing a beat. Ate well, slept well and... Woke up fatigued again today, saying that he would feel dizzy when getting up. Not as beat down as the day before but still really tired. 

I just got back from the check up scheduling, but I would like some imput on the situation. Can anyone indulge me and give an opinion on what's happening? 

Thanks in advance, and have a nice day.",2,1763060559.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1ow9rhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1ow9rhz/mil_not_treating_sil_and_dh_lovingly_after_fil/,MIL not treating SIL and DH lovingly after FIL passed,"Hello everybody! Trigger warning: Loss of a family member. 

For one, sorry for the long read. I feel super conflicted about posting this because I feel that it makes my husband and I sound like assholes but just need to vent, get advice, something…..

Anyways, 3 weeks ago my FIL suddenly passed away in his sleep at the age of 69. My husband and I have lived out in Tennessee for the last 5 years while his parents and sister live out in Colorado still. It was tragic, unexpected and there were no signs of complications previously so it was a shock for everyone. My MIL is the one that called my husband and told the news. So, we were all grieving the loss of my FIL while also figuring out how we will get to Colorado to help MIL and SIL emotionally through this.

Now for some context, my MIL has always been persistent, pushy, manipulative and controlling, hidden behind a veil of kindness and generosity. (See my previous post from years ago talking about how she is) She is very religious and is constantly preaching to anyone she comes into contact with. Her daughter (my SIL age 35) recently got a divorce earlier this year and also through that time got a DUI. I don’t agree with her actions as far as the drinking and driving goes but my MIL is very harsh about it. More on that later. My FIL ran a thriving business for the last thirty years and that was what he always wanted to be involved in literally up til the day he died. That business was his heart and soul and it also allowed for MIL to never have to work. My SIL (let’s call her A) worked very closely with her dad for the last 12 years as administrative assistant and handled payroll and such. My husband even worked there as a mechanic for the first 7 years of our marriage.

Okay, so the day before we fly out to Colorado my MIL calls and we’re all feeling emotional still and being compassionate towards MIL because she just lost her husband. Well, as soon as she gets on the phone she starts complaining about SIL and how they wanted to go to lunch after looking through pics of FIL. She said that A wanted MIL to drive because they were going to an Italian restaurant and A wanted to get a glass of wine. Apparently my MIL chose that moment to call her out and say she was “an alcoholic and she would be lying drunk in a ditch somewhere if she didn’t get her act together.” So naturally A gets annoyed and decides she’s had enough for the day and goes home. MIL took it as proof that she’s an alcoholic because “why would someone get that upset and leave if it wasn’t true”. There’s no way it could be due to the fact her DAD JUST DIED and she wanted to have a glass of of wine to cope with it in that moment, right!?! During the phone call she also was being conflicted about where the after funeral reception would be held. SIL used to work as a server at a fancy golf course and offered to get a reservation setup there in the dining area for an extremely discounted rate. Food would be served and the atmosphere would have been cozy for everyone to share their stories and love for FIL. Well my MIL was conflicted having it there because there would be a bar on site and she didn’t want anyone to be able to access it and didn’t want A to be the one in charge of it.

So fast forward to us being in Colorado. We arrive and MIL is same as she always is. I’m thinking she was still in a state of shock and denial because she was kinda acting like nothing even happened. The SIL found his will that they literally had created 01/2024 and everything is 100% going towards MIL. The house, vehicles, the business, everything! Now I don’t mean to sound harsh but MIL has not had a job in over 40 years and does not understand how life works. FIL took care of everything. MIL didn’t even know what day trash day was and they’ve lived in their house for 20 years. She didn’t even know what FILs wishes were for his body (had to find that out from FILs sister all the way in Texas). Her day consists of starting her day in whatever way she pleases, preaching to people, walking the dog and maybe making some meals for breakfast and dinner. She has lived in a fantasy world ever since I’ve known her. So needless to say DH and SIL were shocked to see that the business was put in MILs name. She only ever went to the business to pull DH or SIL out for lunch (where she would usually just tell them what they need to work on to be better Christians, etc). She has no idea what the business operations consist of, how many employees there are, if it’s profitable, etc. My SIL was working at the business on the day her father died, not even knowing the reason he hadn’t come into work yet. She is very involved with the operations, and has poured herself into that company so the thought of the business ending up essentially in a toddlers hands has been stressful to say the least.

MIL and SIL’s relationship has been strained ever since she was young. MIL is constantly trying to force her beliefs on her and calling her out all the time for things she can fix. She’s called her overweight, an alcoholic, too depressed, a bad daughter, etc. so naturally SIL keeps her distance from her as much as possible. Well now that FIL is gone, there is necessary family business that needs to be taken care of and MIL is being stubborn and not trusting anything that A tries to help her with. When they took FILs body to the funeral home, MIL told them that she doesn’t care what happens to his body because that is no longer her husband. SIL had to setup the cremation and agreed to pick up his ashes when they were ready. MIL wants nothing to do with the ashes. She says they are useless to her.

Meanwhile, the whole time she’s fighting DH and I on everything. We were trying to help setup a place to hold the reception. We suggest the church since it would be free and that’s where everything will be held anyways and she keeps coming up with reasons why it wouldn’t work, yet she doesn’t want to do it anywhere else. And look, I completely understand, if it were me, nowhere would be good enough either. But throughout the week she kept fighting us on everything. Now mind you, we only had a week to get everything setup for the memorial service. We got the service programs setup and the obituary written out and she had something to complain about with that. We literally had it completed and then she tells us that she was gonna have someone else do it. She kept wanting to get involved and take over the planning for everything but then never made any actions towards it. We had to be the ones to order flowers for the stage and tables, buy the tablecloths, order the memory book, setup the picture slideshow, create and print the programs. Even though it was painful for us, we did all of it because we figured she would be too distraught to do anything. But everything we did was met with push back. It was extremely frustrating.

While we were there, for lodging, we had to stay in the same house that FIL passed away in, literally in the very next room to theirs. Every morning we would be bombarded with MIL asking a million questions. I’m talking as soon as I opened the bedroom door we would be met with a conversation. DH and I are used to our own space and slow, quiet mornings with our coffee so immediately having to perform for someone as soon as we woke up was already frustrating. DH was having nightmares about finding his dad dead in the house so we decided to stay at SILs apartment for the rest of the week. MIL wasn’t left alone either, she had a good friend staying with her at the house. But every single night MIL would pester and blow up our phones asking where we were staying the night at, if she needed to come pick us up (even though we had a vehicle we were using), etc. She absolutely hated the thought that we were staying at SILs instead of with her. I totally get that she probably wanted us around more, but it felt like we were being toddlers. Towards the end of the week, extended family flew out for the service (family we hadn’t seen in 9 years) and she couldn’t handle us having private conversations with them alone. She had to be around for every single conversation and interrupt to get attention back on her. We wanted to plan a family dinner and every restaurant that we came up with, she had a problem with. One of the days we were there she received a bunch of sympathy cards in the mail. She asked if DH wanted to read them and he said not at that moment but he would read them privately later on. She then immediately turned to her friend and had her read the cards out loud in front of us even though we just told her we didn’t want to read them at that time. I don’t know. I feel like we’re being too harsh because of the circumstances but also MIL has always been this way and I guess we were thinking she would be so emotionally torn up that she would be focused on uniting the family instead of being hateful towards SIL and not trusting any of us to help her. She only got tearful when other people were around expressing sympathy. She never cried through his memorial service. And I know people handle grief in different ways, but it didn’t really feel like she was even upset that FIL was gone.

I am frustrated about all of this not even for my sake but for my husband. He is torn emotionally between being sad he lost his father so unexpectedly to being angry at his mom for causing more division. We live in Tennessee and have made ourselves a quaint little life out here. Like this year we literally just got to where we wanted to be financially, friendship wise and more. SIL is still out in Colorado handling the business (which is what she would like to continue to do), way too accessible for MIL to get to and cause issues with. So I know DH is worried about his sister and hoping that she won’t go insane being the one having to deal with their mom just popping in unexpectedly all the time. SIL is still working the business and keeping everyone happy and getting the jobs done but all that could change in an instant with MIL holding the reins to it.

It feels like every other day we get a phone call from SIL about how MIL is making some weird decision. We are all fully aware that everything belongs to MIL and she can rightfully do what she wants with it but at the same time, it’s scary to think she has so much control over so much and doesn’t know what to do with it. Obviously if we had the choice we would rather have FIL be here then be concerned about his material possessions but it’s hard to think the business, something he spent majority of his life building, would be left to ruin at the hands of someone that has no clue what they’re doing. I know it’s also a mind f*** for DH and SIL because they hoped they would receive some sort of inheritance and the fact they aren’t listed on the will is hard to believe. They both had a pretty good relationship with FIL so it’s been hard for them to understand why everything would be left to only their mom. This family has always been weirdly dysfunctional but man, I never thought it could get worse than it was.

Thanks for hearing me out, sorry if everything wasn’t very coherent or well written. There’s so many more layers to this too but I would have to write a book for that haha.",7,1763060557.0,JUSTNOMIL,2,0.89,False

You're not alone — and the good news is: **you don’t need to avoid specific foods**, just use a few simple precautions.

At Smart Start, our devices are alcohol-specific, so most “false positives” are caused by trace amounts of alcohol in your mouth from certain products — not actual intoxication. Here's what to keep in mind:

**Possible Triggers (But Only Temporarily):**

* **Pastries, pizza, and carbs**: Can produce trace alcohol from natural yeast.  
* **Mouthwash and breath sprays**: Many contain alcohol.  
* **Sugar-free gum or mints**: Sugar alcohols like xylitol can briefly register.  
* **Kombucha**: Naturally fermented, so trace alcohol is possible.  
* **Flavored coffee drinks**: Syrups or extracts might contain small amounts of alcohol.  

**Safe Items:**

* **Spicy food**: No impact on modern IIDs.  
* **Smoking**: Doesn’t affect readings (but avoid blowing smoke into the device).  
* **Perfumes or hand sanitizer**: Only an issue if used right before testing.  
* **Vaping**: Only a concern if your vape liquid contains ethanol.

**Pro Tips:**

✅ Rinse your mouth with water before testing  
✅ Wait 5 minutes after eating, drinking, or vaping  
✅ Avoid using alcohol-based mouthwash right before you blow

1ow9qes,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1ow9qes/aita_for_letting_my_husband_pay_for_my_creative/,AITA for letting my husband pay for my creative space when he doesn't understand what I need to feel alive?,"My husband used our joint savings to pay for the apartment where I was seeing someone else, and I convinced him it was ""my creative space.""

I got married last June. I'm 29, husband is 34. Two months after the wedding, I reconnected with someone I knew from college at a work conference. We started texting. Then meeting for coffee. Then more.

I didn't want to end things with my husband. I genuinely loved him. But I also felt this incredible connection with this other guy, and I told myself I deserved to explore it. Marriage shouldn't mean I stop being myself, right? I'm still my own person with my own needs.

The guy (let's call him J) lived about 40 minutes away. His wife worked nights as a nurse, which meant we had evenings free. I told my husband I needed space to work on my art. He's always been supportive of my painting, so when I said I wanted to rent a small studio apartment to really focus without distractions, he didn't question it. He even offered to cover the rent from our joint account since ""your art is important.""

The apartment was $1,200 a month. I met J there three times a week, sometimes four. We'd order takeout, watch movies, have sex. I kept some art supplies there to make it look legitimate. I even did a few paintings so I could show my husband ""what I'd been working on.""

This went on for seven months.

My husband would ask how the art was going. I'd show him photos of paintings I'd barely touched. He'd smile and say he was proud of me for pursuing my passion. He started telling his family about how dedicated I was, how I was really coming into my own as an artist. His mom even asked to buy one of my pieces.

I felt guilty sometimes. But I also felt alive in a way I hadn't in years. J made me laugh. He listened to me. My husband was wonderful, but predictable. Safe. J was exciting.

Then last week, my phone rang while I was at the grocery store. Unknown number. I almost didn't answer.

""Is this \[my name\]?"" Woman's voice. Tight. Angry.

""Yes?""

""This is J's wife. I found your texts on his phone. I know about the apartment. I know everything.""

My stomach dropped. I stood there in the cereal aisle, frozen.

She continued. ""I'm pregnant. Did you know that? Three months. While you were fucking my husband in an apartment YOUR husband paid for, I was at home growing his baby.""

I couldn't speak.

""I have screenshots of everything. The texts. The apartment address. Your husband's name from when J mentioned who was paying for it. I'm sending it all to your family. Your husband. Everyone.""

She hung up.

I drove home shaking. My husband wasn't there yet. I paced the kitchen, trying to figure out what to say, how to explain. My phone kept buzzing. Texts from my sister. My mom. My aunt. All saying the same thing: ""CALL ME NOW.""

My husband came home an hour later. His face was blank. He walked past me to our bedroom, started pulling a suitcase from the closet.

""How long?"" he asked.

""I can explain.""

""How long have I been paying for you to cheat on me?""

""Seven months. But it's not what you think. I never stopped loving you. I just needed something different. Something that was mine. Marriage doesn't mean I give up who I am.""

He laughed. Actually laughed. ""Who you are is someone who took my money and used it to fuck someone else. Who you are is someone who looked me in the eye every single day and lied.""

""You don't understand. It's complicated.""

""It's really not."" He zipped the suitcase. ""My lawyer will contact you about the divorce. And you're going to pay back every penny of that apartment rent.""

My family isn't speaking to me. My mom called me a disgrace. My dad won't answer my calls. My sister sent one text: ""You're dead to me.""

Christmas was at my parents' house three days ago. I wasn't invited, but J's wife was. She showed up with printouts of everything. Every text. Every lie I told my husband. Photos J had taken of us at the apartment. She spread them across the dining room table in front of my entire extended family and told them exactly who paid for what.

My grandmother, who's 86 and deeply religious, cried. My uncle called me a whore. My cousin's husband said if I ever came near their family again, he'd make sure everyone in town knew what I did.

J's wife stood there the whole time, three months pregnant, and told them she just wanted them to know the truth about who I really am. Then she left.

My husband filed for divorce. He's asking for the apartment rent back plus his legal fees. J's wife filed for divorce too, apparently. J lost his job because his boss is friends with his wife's brother and heard everything.

I'm staying with a friend now. My husband changed the locks. I have nothing. Everyone hates me.

But I keep thinking about what I said. Marriage doesn't mean giving up who you are. I wasn't trying to hurt anyone. I just wanted to be happy. I wanted both things. Why is that so wrong?

My friend says I need to take responsibility. That what I did was unforgivable. But part of me wonders if I'm being punished too harshly for just trying to live authentically.

So I guess I'm asking. AITAH for wanting to keep both relationships because giving up one would mean giving up part of myself?

1ow9ohx,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ow9ohx/help_make_my_decision/,Help make my decision,"Hello, this may be low priority compared to other posts on here but if you want to play a fun game, here we are! 

Please help me decide between two opportunities. 

I could stay with my current job, that I do not like, but enjoy the days off and the hours and PTO. It’s in an industry that has growth, but I do not enjoy the industry. I do not get paid enough for the HCOL I live in, but it is hard to find much that pays more. I’ve been here for a year and a half, have gotten one raise, and just really do not enjoy my day to day work or want to continue in the industry. 

I have the opportunity to work as a cake decorator in a major grocery store.  Pay is .70 cents higher starting out, the hours and not having holidays off is a negative, but I’ve always dreamed of owning my own bakery, but they are just not profitable in my town. There is a coffee shop or bakery on every corner and rent is astronomical. I have no professional experience cake decorating but do it as a hobby and really enjoy it. Not sure if I’ll love working at a major grocer, but at least I would be having some fun. 

I am 27, have no idea what I want to do with my life. Where would I go from a cake decorator? I started my current industry because I felt like I was too old to start a career and needed something immediately. But I’m just not happy or find any enjoyment in it. 


Would you stay with current job you don’t enjoy but is a decent career down the line, or do something you enjoy now and see where it goes? How late is too late to start a career? 

Thank you for reading, appreciate all advice and guidance.

1ow9oaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1ow9oaj/i_dont_know_what_she_wanted/,I don't know what she wanted...,"So, I m a 20 M,first to be clear about that...In May,a classmate from my school(her) texted me ""I like you"".I was happy,my world was beautiful,I felt euphoria I never felt in my life before..because we used to vibe back in 8th grade like friends and class rank rivals..I found her cute and still do,and so I reciprocated positively. So, firstly we started having great convos about everything in our lives through texts for around 2 months. Because we were from different colleges,we never met physically until 21 June.we had our first date, everything was awesome,had softies together, coffee,etc. it was a great day.. Everything was gud and I wished her ""happy birthday"" on 4 july,till this point,we used to regularly have convos about our life's, opinions,all things,we foresaw our future together,had great plans,and she told me in every words how much she liked me...I reciprocated the same way...but after that she used to cut short on convos, when asked to call,refused and said she was ""busy"". i thought maybe she is busy,or something happened in her home,maybe her grandma passed away(saw profile picture and assumed perhaps) and I thought it's natural...But after that she always tried to cut short, sometimes I felt ghosted..so I thought maybe she's done with me,and didn't text anything until diwali... During these months,I was very hurt by her behaviour,had mental depressions and kind of had negative thoughts about her,so I tried sometimes to talk about what happened,but to no avail. On diwali,I initiated a ""Happy Diwali wish"" ,and suddenly had a long convo,she telling me her days aren't great either,she is bored and after some talk,she brought up this topic...She said ""She was feeling despo as she was constantly texting me back 2 months,her efforts were 100% and I was not showing that much interest and she thought I was not committed,so she started giving me space."" I was like wtf inside"" but I tried to explain everything and then she asked ""Do you want to date me like going for dates on weekends, meeting sometimes, calling around "". I explained this will not be possible frequently because I m focusing on my career right now,and I can't date you on my mom's money(my mom is the only working person in my home) and I wanted to date a girl on my expense,so I said I can't date anyone proactively now,but she wanted clear yes or no,so I said ""no"" ...
We were over, whatever it was,she was packing up her msgs, hoping you will find someone, and I said same,then bla bla and byee...I don't know how girls work or their minds work,All that sweet things we promised for the greater future all down the drain..Had she said to date her 2 months back,I would have accepted but now I felt mixed feelings,I don't know what it is..but a side of me(inside) wished her best because I thought we had the bond....
Edit: I know I can be wrong but still I wanted to say what was inside my mind as it is...",1,1763060372.0,TwentiesIndia,8,1.0,False

1ow9muo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1ow9muo/i_dont_have_hope/,I don't have hope,"Just a few days ago I was posting here about how I had one cup of coffee with no issues and genuinely feeling some hope for eventual relief. Now, I don't have hope. At all. 

Over the weekend,  I looked for Evian Water as that was suggested to me here. It was out of stock so I tried Alkaline Water. Immediately after drinking it my pain SHOT up to like a 7/10. Previously I had only ever felt urethral pain but this time I felt bladder pain for the first time. Whole bladder was on fire. I don't get it, alkaline water is supposed to be good for this condition? I finally got the pain to calm to my usual 4-5 level with epsom salt bath and heating pad but it took hours. 

  
Getting a cystoscopy in a few days which is more than any other dr has done so far but the Urologist was honest with me. He said if there are lesions he can schedule a procedure to remove them but otherwise can't do much beyond prescribing painkillers. He said his office is not super experienced with IC b/c they were previously able to refer patients to Dr Robert Evans who no longer sees patients. I called some other Urologists and had that same thing told to me 2 other times. One of them the person I spoke to on the phone outright said my state is the worst place to live for IC patients because everyone relied on Dr Evans so nobody bothered to learn to treat it. I can't even find a dr who does Instillations. I can't afford to move but im in the worst place to be! I'm on a waiting list for a Urogyno but it's several months long and who knows if they can help either. 

  
All the tests negative No UTI, no STD/BV/yeast. No mycoplasma. Everything clear. So it's not that, it's def IC. Uro-MP doesn't work. Azo I throw up immediately. Urologist did prescribe me Uribel but Insurance denied it claiming Uro-MP was fine even though I explained on the phone directly it didn't work. I can't afford it. Amitryptiline I've failed before. D Mannose isnt helping. 2 doctors so far have refused to try me on Hydroxizine b/c of my already slow/damaged gut motility they say it'll make it worse. Tried some otc antihistimates (zyrtec and benadryl) for 2 weeks so far no symptom improvements. Tylenol and ibuprofen dont help pain, lidocaine helps with the urethra pain but now I get bladder pain too :(

Pelvic floor PT said that my pelvic floor was ""a lot less tight"" than her other IC patients, no tightness beyond what would generally be expected for a sedentary person of my age. She was honest with me that she doesnt think PT will provide me much relief although I will continue to see her. I also get horrible shooting nerve pains during PT that go from my pelvic area through my legs and feet. My feet are numb and tingling a lot like I can't feel them. PT said she's sorry but she doesnt know what that is. 

  
Adopted bland diet and thought I was doing OK. The post I made on here unfortunately gave me huge food anxiety (I was doing like, bland chicken and rice/potatoes but then saw posts like, no don't do potatoes b/c Oxalates, no those are all triggers do Alkaline diet, no just do Liquid Diet). The food anxiety was so bad I went almost 48h without eating, only water. Symptoms didnt get better. I still feel so much anxiety every time I eat and I'm eating very small amounts of food and very bland but there's no change in my symptoms. No relief at all even though I'm following diet to the letter. 

  
I don't have ""flares"" like people describe here I'm just in constant pain (mosty Urethral but since the alkaline water weird flare it's bladder too sometimes). No urgency ori ncreased freuqency JUST pain. My quality of life is a 0. I sit on the couch or bed with heating pad or occasionally take an Epsom salt bath. Standing or even sitting up hurts. I don't leave the house. I cancelled all my Thanksgiving Holiday plans because of the pain. I'm essentially housebound. I have no hope that I'm going to get better any more.

This will be a standalone chapter in the *Coffee Talk* series, inviting you to slow down and savour the quiet moments.

Set in a late-night café tucked away in Tokyo, you’ll take on the role of a barista serving drinks to humans and magical beings alike. Each cup you craft shapes the conversations, revealing personal stories, dreams, and struggles from a brand-new cast.

You’ll get to experiment with hot and cold drinks, play with sprinkle stencils to elevate your latte art, and scroll through Tomodachill — an in-game social feed that offers deeper glimpses into your customers’ lives. All of this is wrapped in a chill lo-fi soundtrack by returning composer Andrew “AJ” Jeremy, blending soft beats and mellow jazz inspired by Tokyo’s summer nights.

Some might not like this but i got friendzoned and im playing the long-ish game. Im just not giving a fuck anymore. We hang out a lot. We talk a good amount every day or so.

I used to care that i feel like im betraying her trust for trying to be her friend when i secretly like her but lowkey i think she (subconsciously) uses me for attention.

So the option to be w me is in front of her until i get cuffed by someone else. Idc what i said in the past, she should know i like her. It would just be pure ignorance if she thought my feelings were gone. And she still hangs out with me every weekend. Still texts me everyday. Now we have long calls and she tells me about her problems. If she using me fine, if she finds better than me fine. I kinda dont see it tho. She hasnt been on a date date in forever.

(I promise i care about her deeply, but this is the only way i cope with the friendzone. Like cut the bullshit im sorry, a dude is not gonna want to grab dinner with you alone, go to bakeries with you alone, go get coffee with you alone, and you think im not trying to hit that?

1ow9kjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewilddotty/comments/1ow9kjv/suzzies_day/,Suzzie’s Day.,"Suzzie joined me in the kitchen for coffee early Saturday morning. She had showered and her wavy, shoulder length, brunette head was damp. She got a cup of coffee and sat across from me. She took a sip and sat back, a slight grin on her wide, pinkish lips.

I told her happy birthday and asked if she felt different. “Thank you. I feel enlightened. Not because I’m a year older, but from all that took place yesterday. Having sex with your young neighbors. My goodness, Dotty.”

“It was fun, though, huh. You needed this.”  I said, smiling at my pretty friend.

“I guess so! I just may be damned after having sex with boys that young. I’m officially a dirty old woman now. Thanks to you for the invite.” Suzzie said.

We sat a talked, laughing about things we all did and had done with young Kenny and Danny. I asked if she was up for another fun filled day. 

Suzzie squirmed in the chair, rested back with an arm on the back. The light kimono robe stretched tight across her full breasts, the large nipples poking against the thin fabric.

Just then a not fully awake young Danny came into the kitchen in his boxer briefs, and got a soda from the fridge. He popped it and took a big guzzle, groaning after that, “Oh that’s good. I was dry.”

We both looked at the youngster standing there practically nude. The boxer briefs did nothing but highlight young Danny’s fat seven inch dong, stretched to one side towards his hip.

He took another long gulp of the soda. Suzzie’s blue eyes ran over his young physique and studied the thick bulge in his undies.

“So, did you rest well. Spent the night with Diane, huh. It’s Suzzie’s birthday today.” I said.

Danny looked at us, smiled, then stepped over and gave Suzzie a kiss on the cheek, wishing her a happy birthday. He straightened up and took another swig of his soda. 

Suzzie was eye to eye with his navel and thick package. I knew she was remembering getting that used on her. She shifted a bit and pulled her hungry eyes away from staring at him.

“Hmm.” Suzzie hummed, taking a sip of coffee. She glanced over at me and pursed her lips quickly. As if to say, ‘ooo’.

I suggested they retreat to the living room while I whipped up Suzzie’s cake. Danny fetched another soda and she freshened her coffee then went to living room sofa. The short kimono robe barely covered her sexy ass cheeks and revealed the red bikini panties underneath.

“Be a good boy now, Daniel. It’s her birthday.” I told him. Danny smiled and stepped over by me.

“I’m always a good boy, aren’t I, Dotty.” Danny said, kissing me. His hand going to the front of my robe.

I pushed his hand away as he was attempting to feel my pussy. “Now go on. Go keep the birthday girl company. There is plenty of time for me later.” I told him, giving his tight ass a pinch as he turned and glanced at Suzzie on the sofa.

Danny sat next to Suzzie on the sofa. She had turned the news on the tv. I got out the cake ingredients. 

As I worked at making the birthday cake I could see the sofa and hear some things being said. Danny was getting frisky with her. Suzzie had her own ideas.

“It’s my day, young man. You just relax and let me do what I want to.” Suzzie insisted.

She set her coffee down and turned to the side facing young Danny. Her hand roamed over his bare chest, leaning in and kissing his nipples.

“You make me want to do things I never imagined doing with someone your age. You all started it, though, yesterday.” Suzzie softly said to him.

She rubbed down to his fat bulge and felt its girth and length. Suzzie slowly pulled the briefs down over his hardening length of cock.

“Oh my, honey. You have a very nice cock.”
Suzzie said, smiling at his flushed face.

She started stroking him, pumping her hand on the young fuck tool. She let a drip of her spit drop onto her gripping hand and worked it up and down on the now hardened length.

Her mouth went to it and she bobbed her wet lips on him. She kept pumping him when her mouth came from it. Looking at the heated, flushed look on his young face.

“You like that, sweetie. I do. I almost forgot how much I do like sucking a nice hard cock.”Suzzie remarked, grinning as she lowered lips to him again.

Young Danny couldn’t sit still. Squirming and jerking from the treatment Suzzie was giving him with her bobbing mouth. She kept this up for quite awhile. She was enjoying herself.

Suzzie stood up and opened her robe. She peeled off her red panties, not taking her eyes off of young Danny. Her robe slipped from her naked body.

Suzzie slightly rubbed the short, dark pubic mound, staring at Danny and said, “You have me so wet.”

Suzzie knelt over his lap and reached for his hard cock. “Oh my. Oh, that’s so good.” She moaned as her pussy slowly slid down the hard shaft.

Estava há um tempo curioso sobre esse método, mas o preço da AP original eu julgo ser muito alto, principalmente pra mim que gosto demais do V60.

Achei a qualidade desse modelo boa, a vedação do embolo não vaza.

Meu primeiro preparo fiz com um blend de 1 parte Caramelindo, 2 partes Frutadinho e 2 partes do Sanfoneio da Astral.

Usei os mesmos parâmetros do V60: 18g de café, 215ml + 35ml bypass, click 90 no K6, água a 90c, tempo total 2:45, pressionando lentamente durante o ultimo minuto.

O resultado, comparado com o V60, foi um pouco mais de corpo e notas de chocolate mais acentuadas, um pouco menos de nitidez nos aromas frutados e florais. Acidez talvez um pouco maior.

Pesquisando por receitas, vi uma tendência, inclusive entre campeões, de usar temperaturas mais baixas, perto de 80c. Amanhã vou testar isso com uma moagem mais fina também.

I go to leave, hug her goodbye, not really expecting to hear from or see her again. But at the door she makes it a point to tell me she’s free the whole week/weekend and to txt her if I wanted to see her again. 

Shes left me on read since Tuesday. I don’t really want to just keep being the one to reach out, esp if she leaves me on read. My gut says to just move on, but I’m having a hard time deciphering what I’m seeing as mixed signals.

So I’ve got a coffee chat coming up with the **Head of Infra Investments** at a **Middle Eastern sovereign fund**, and honestly not sure what to expect from it.

Quick background on me – I’ve worked in **private equity before**, but more on the **early-stage side** (think seed to series A/B kind of stuff). I’m currently with **one of the MBBs**, working on the **middle office / deal support** side, so while I’m still close to investments, it’s not really the same as being on the buy-side full time.

I’m really trying to **move into core PE**, and infra seems like a solid fit given all the long-term tailwinds (energy transition, data centers, renewables, etc).

Just wondering – what sort of **conversation** should I expect in this chat? Is it going to be more technical or casual? Also, what should I **prep for** so that it’s actually engaging and doesn’t feel like I’m just interviewing them?

Would also appreciate any tips on:

* Key **topics or trends** in infra investing I should know (valuation, risk-return, deal structure, etc)
* How to subtly show I’m interested in PE without coming off like I’m fishing for a job
* Any good questions to ask senior folks at this level so it doesn’t sound like I googled them 5 mins before the call

Would love to hear from anyone who’s had a similar chat with fund guys or infra investors before.

1ow9i5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ow9i5h/112_lbs_weight_loss_in_1_year_heres_what_worked/,112 lbs weight loss in 1 year. Here's what worked for me and what didnt.,"I feel like most people just tell me to eat less when it comes to losing weight. I literally hated it. So here is what I actually did to lose 112 lbs.

1. Don’t overload yourself with fiber or foods your body just can’t break down. I learned this the hard way. I basically lived on the toilet for a while. BTW not fun. Tons of diets will preach “eat endless lettuce” “snack on peas all day” or “go nuts with corn.” If you do that, your digestive system is going to go into literal overdrive. Sure, the average person carries around 3 to 8 pounds of uhhh waste and yes bathroom reading time is productive, but you’ve got a life outside that porcelain throne.
2. Lettuce? Honestly, it’s the biggest scam in the veggie world. If you want greens, eat the ones that do something for you like spinach for iron, kale and bok choy for all that nutrient goodness, collards and Swiss chard for all the minerals your body actually needs. Lettuce is basically crunchy water with a side of fiber. Throw some Swiss chard on your sandwich. Stir-fry some bok choy.
3. This one I don’t hear alot of.. Log your weight with progress pictures everyday. Like I would look back from previous months and when I would see “12 lbs lost this month” I would be so fired up to keep on going. Holding yourself accountable is so important guys trust me I quit like 10 times before I actually did it. The app I personally used for this or I think the only one you can do this on is called “Jurney” on the app store not sure if its that popular but I saw it on a tiktok.
4. Drink… but don’t DRINK you feel me? A glass of something after a long day can help you relax, and that’s genuinely good for your health. Some alcohol even has small benefits (I am not a doctor btw) antioxidants in wine, vodka killing germs, bourbon helping a cold. And alcohol loosens you up physically, which might be why your grandma who drank like a pirate made it to 97. But once you go past “a little” you’re suddenly chugging calories and your self-control goes flying out the window. My always drunk professor once said, “For every drink you think you drank, there were three you didn’t think you drank… and that’s why you can’t remember what you drank.” Honestly, she mayyyybe was right.
5. Smoking wrecks your cardio and so does dirty air. I don’t smoke, but I dropped about 40 pounds after moving away from a smoker and into a place where the air didn’t feel like soup. I started doing my cardio at the gym instead of outside because, shocker, it's easier to exercise when you can breathe.
6. As for sports, here’s the deal: swimming an hour burns roughly 400 calories, and running for an hour burns about 300. But grinding out laps or running in a circle for 60 straight minutes? Pure torture. Some people live for running good for them. I’m not one of those people. But can I run during a two-hour soccer game? Yep. Can I do a hundred accidental squats during volleyball? Definitely. Can I work my triceps rowing across a lake while pretending I’m in a nature documentary? Absolutely. It’s exercise without the suffering.
7. Start now. Stop waiting for the “perfect moment.” Want to go to the beach? Go. Want to wear a crop top? Wear it. I used to think everyone would stare, whisper, and judge the whole nightmare scenario. That’s how high school was for me. And yeah, when I started wearing bikinis as an adult, a few kids still made comments. But way more people either said something nice or didn’t care at all. Turns out, I was just another human being, not a billboard begging for insults.
8. Here’s another thing: most green foods have almost no calories. The exception? Avocados. Those things are tiny calorie bombs coated in fat and somehow manage to taste like enchanted ogre mucus unless they’re in guac. Meanwhile, mint chocolate chip ice cream also green absolutely has zero calories. Don’t argue with me it’s literally science I made up.
9. Stop putting your life on hold. Don’t wait to “get skinny” before getting a haircut or buying clothes you love. Stop delaying being happy.
10. Lastly, sleep is sacred. So if anyone finds you napping in the grass after stretching at the park, just tell them you’re prioritizing recovery. And accept their coffee money with gratitude.

I hope this helps guys!

1ow9hqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthday/comments/1ow9hqg/happy_birthday_to_me/,Happy birthday to me,"I'm 18 now 

Suddenly, you’re 27.You make your coffee, rush to work, come home around 7, and you're too tired to do anything except eat, scroll on your phone, and pass out.
Then you wake up, and do it all again.And when Friday comes, maybe you go out, or maybe you're just too tired.
Then, out of nowhere, it hits you:How did everything pass by so quickly?You don't even feel 27.
You still feel like that 17-year-old kid who thought they had all the time in the world. Somehow, 10 years just disappeared.
And you start missing the past—the feeling of being young, excited, and clueless.But then you realize, one day, you’ll miss this, too.
Being 18, being confused, being tired, but still trying.So maybe the trick is to slow down a bit and actually live this chapter before it also becomes just another memory.The point? No matter what age you are, you’ll miss these days.
Life gets busy, and it’s always a good idea to stop and smell the roses.~AkhrorWhen someone asks, “Tumhare liye definition of life kya hai?” it’s hard to answer unless you’re used to such questions.
Not everyone has the logic or curiosity to ask what really drives your thinking.But for me, the answer was always clear. Life was never about being rich, good-looking, famous, or owning cars, gadgets, and clothes.
It wasn’t about following social media trends or pretending to be someone I’m not.
It was always about being happy with what I had—the people around me and everything else that came with it.Looking back, I realize I ended up with the wrong people more times than I’d like to admit.
If I’m being honest, I wasted a lot of time investing in them.
But I don’t regret it—I learned more from those experiences than I could have imagined.There’s a different version of you that exists in everyone’s mind.
At some point, this stopped working for me because I was the same everywhere—no change in how I talked or behaved.
And because of that, I lost a lot of people along the way.So here’s the conclusion:
I’m turning 18 tomorrow, and I have this obsession with sharing how I feel.
And honestly, there’s no better place than Reddit for that.
I’m also thankful to Reddit—I’ve met some amazing people here and had some great experiences.14/11/25.Signing off.",1,1763059952.0,birthday,2,1.0,False

From soul warming coquito latte at 787 Coffee to buttery croissants at Lafayette Grand Café and then onto loaded breakfast burritos from Electric Burrito. To the city’s best bagels at Tompkins Square Bagels and Leon’s, this one’s all about comfort, caffeine, and good company.

We’ll stroll, sip, snack, and share. Just like always. Try a bite at every stop or just tag along for the for the scenery/company. Either way, you’re guaranteed laughter, friendly faces, and enough carbs to fuel a small army.

To wrap things up, we’ll finish on a sweet note at Dominique Ansel Bakery. Because no Foodie Fam crawl is complete without dessert for breakfast.

There is an already an existing group!! 

**Meeting up at 787 Coffee 9am!!! - 101 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003**

**☕ 787 Coffee**

Start your morning right with some of the smoothest, boldest coffee beans straight from Puerto Rico’s mountains.  
To try – Their coquito latte because it warms the soul and your abuela would want you to.

**🥯 Tompkins Square Bagels | East Village Bagels**

NYC’s breakfast staple at its finest. Hand-rolled, perfectly chewy, and overloaded with flavor.  
To try - The Bacon, Egg & Cheese on Everything Bagel. If you don’t have a BCE in NYC. Do you even exist.

**🌯 Electric Burrito**

Fuel up with breakfast burritos big enough to count as a weapon.  
To try - The Breakfast Burrito with hash browns and sausage. Classic comfort food wrapped in a tortilla of joy.

**🥐 Lafayette Grand Café & Bakery**

This is your fancy detour before the food coma.  
To try - The Pistachio Croissant. Flaky, nutty, and just bougie enough to make you feel like you brunch in Paris. 

**🥯 Leon’s Bagels or Popup Bagels**

Two of NYC’s current bagel heavyweights. Chewy perfection meets cult-favorite status.  
To try  - A Classic Schmear or Hot Honey Bacon Sandwich. No wrong choice here.

**🍳 Daily Provisions**

The brunch MVP serving the most satisfying morning sandwiches in the city.  
To try-  The Lumberjack! Bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiched between a maple cruller. Yea you read that right.

**🍫 Dominique Ansel Bakery**

End your crawl with some edible magic.  
To try -  The Blossoming Hot Chocolate. Drop the marshmallow flower into your cup and watch it bloom before revealing a chocolate pearl surprise.",1,1763059928.0,nycmeetups,1,0.67,False

I’ve been working with a running coach for a while now ($100/month), and it’s been great. But I’m thinking about switching to the *Albon* app. Main reason: I’m about to become a dad in May 🎉, and let’s be real - I have no idea how much training I’ll actually get in once the baby arrives.

So, I’m curious:

* Anyone tried the *Albon* app and actually liked it?
* How flexible is it when life gets messy (read: newborn chaos + full-time job)?
* Does it sneak in any David Roche/Speed-style stuff, like adding strides at the end of runs, or is it just “run and pray”?
* For the parents out there — how much running/training did you realistically manage with a newborn in the house?

Trying to figure out if keeping my coach makes sense in those first months, or if something more flexible like *Albon* could do the job… even if I end up running on three hours of sleep and one cup of coffee.

Appreciate any experiences, advice, or horror stories 🙏",0,1763059822.0,trailrunning,0,0.33,False

1ow9efd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1ow9efd/just_launched_a_productivity_tool/,Just launched a productivity tool,"I've been really influenced by people like Cal Newport, who wrote Deep Work and Slow Productivity (great books if you haven't read them). In an effort to do more deep work, I decided to build a productivity app inspired by everything I've learned from him and others with similar philosophies. 

I also wanted to include a Pomodoro timer page where users can choose cool backgrounds and listen to focus music without opening YouTube or a music player. 

What I came up with is [Deep Day](http://deepday.me) (deepday.me). 

The most significant benefit of the app is that your to-do list on the main dashboard shows only today's tasks, right alongside a time-block schedule for the day. To see your full to-do list, you have to switch to a different page. This way, you stay focused on the few things you need to do today.

This took a lot of toil, sweat, and brainstorming to get right, and I need to continue making improvements, but it's finally viable.

Here are a couple of screenshots so you can see how it turned out:

[Dashboard](https://preview.redd.it/161p52npi21g1.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=98448d2700d00c87f5fce9568899fea282734a9d)

In the future, I'd like to incorporate habit/metric tracking, life-vision journaling, and multi-timescale planning. But I want to make sure it all stays non-overwhelming and straightforward.

Hopefully one day, Deep Day can move from a side project to a real job :) We'll see. 

If you want to use it, I'd love your feedback! Also, if anyone DM's me, I'll be happy to give you a referral code.

             🖤Thoughts about the bag🖤

The Balenciaga Rodeo is honestly one of my absolute favorites, and this is actually my fourth one. My first large size, but nonetheless my fourth Rodeo which should say everything about how much I love it. It is that rare mix of laid back and elevated, making it the perfect choice for working moms who want something stylish but still super functional. The design is roomy and structured just enough to hold its shape but still soft enough to feel casual and easy to carry. It fits my 2 15” laptops, planner, my iPad Pro, chargers, 2 iPhones, snacks for the kids, and even a 2 makeup bags without ever feeling overstuffed or heavy. I’ve taken it to work twice and the handles are holding steady and huh show or feel like they’re straining. 🥰😍

The leather is incredibly soft and supple, the kind that just melts in your hands. It has that luxe, lived in texture that only gets better the more you use it. The craftsmanship really shows through in the smooth zippers, precise stitching, and thoughtful pocket placement. I also love that it is not too flashy but still turns heads with that signature Balenciaga slouch and minimal hardware. The strap options make it even more versatile because you can switch from top handle to shoulder carry or crossbody without missing a beat, which is ideal when you are holding coffee in one hand and your phone in the other. 🤤🤤

What makes the Rodeo Large stand out from other designer totes I own is how well it transitions through every part of my day. It looks perfectly polished with work outfits like tailored trousers and blazers but still pairs effortlessly with my off duty mom looks like leggings, sneakers, and an oversized hoodie. It is also travel friendly since it holds everything I need for long car rides or weekend tournaments for the kids. It is honestly that perfect carry everything and still look cute bag. 👏🏽

Every time I rotate it out of my lineup, I find myself missing it and pulling it right back out. It is dependable, beautifully made, and somehow makes even chaotic mornings feel a little more put together. The Rodeo is not just a bag to me at this point, it is a staple in my collection that keeps proving why I keep buying it again and again. 🤌🏽💯

             🖤Thoughts about the factory🖤

Kata Factory is seriously the GOAT when it comes to Rodeos in my opinion. I have one from Kaidi, one from Genie, and another from a factory I honestly can’t even remember, and my Kata ones are hands down my favorite. The leather is buttery soft and smells amazing, and the best part is that the scent actually lingers, which I love. The hardware feels super solid and the craftsmanship is just perfection. Every detail is clean and sturdy with no flaws at all. I honestly have zero complaints and will keep going back to Kata for all my Balenciaga bags. 👩🏽‍🔬🧪🔬🏭

             🖤Thoughts about the seller🖤

Mandy has become my homegirl! We talk about life and girl problems etc. Most of yall know her so there’s not much to be said but that she’s amazing! Love her! 💝👯‍♀️

1ow9czu,https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/1ow9czu/chess_in_armenia/,Chess in Armenia,"Hi All - I am visiting next year for a photography workshop so have been reading up on your country.

I have been very interested to read about the importance of chess in the country, and I have some questions (if that's ok :-)).

First is whether anyone can try to articulate why chess became so prominent and explain it's importance/relevance to Armenian society.

Second is where it is played. I have seen there are some pretty major centres but am guessing that it also played in more informal settings - maybe coffee shops, bars, outside areas when the weather is fine?

Lastly - and this question is maybe broader than chess - is how people feel about having their photographs taken. Is there a consensus view/attitudes on this or any particular concerns?

Sorry as this is a lot of questions, but appreciate any info or guidance.",2,1763059650.0,armenia,0,1.0,False

1ow9b09,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ow9b09/the_hosts_of_creepcast_are_no_longer_human/,The Hosts of CreepCast are No Longer Human.,"The warehouse always smelled faintly of metal and coffee. It wasn’t a bad smell, just wrong for morning. The air in the studio was cool enough that Isaiah could see his breath when he first unlocked the door. A thin trail of vapor, gone almost as soon as it appeared.

He flicked on the lights. The room answered with a harsh buzz. The LED strips glowed a little too white, washing the color from his skin. He rubbed at his neck. The flesh there felt cold and papery, though he didn’t think much of it.

The neon sign on the back wall sputtered to life.

CREEPCAST.

The orange light wavered before settling, casting a dull reflection across the table. The foam panels around the room swallowed sound. The silence that followed was thick enough to make him aware of every motion — the click of the laptop booting, the whisper of cables sliding against the desk, the static flutter as he switched the soundboard on.

He cracked open an energy drink and took a long swallow. The liquid tasted metallic, sharper than usual like he was drinking penny water. When he set the can down, he caught his reflection in the dark monitor across from him. The eyes staring back looked bloodshot. He blinked and the red vanished.

Routine steadied him.

Project file open. Gain levels checked. Mic one, mic two, ring lights. He hummed to test the reverb in the space and watched the audio bars bounce green. The hum sounded lower than it should have, as if his throat had sunk deeper.

He went to the glass door and peered into the gray parking lot. Empty.

10:42 a.m. 8 years into the podcast, and Hunter still couldn’t show up on time. 

Isaiah stood there longer than he meant to, staring at the asphalt through the haze of morning light. The air outside rippled faintly, as if heat were rising from it, though the temperature was cold. He realized he was pressing his fingertips against the glass too hard — when he pulled them back, faint smudges were left behind, almost greasy.

The door creaked open behind him.

Hunter stepped in, hoodie half-zipped, the faint smell of fast food trailing with him. “Morning, Dr. Audiofile,” he said, voice bright as ever. But his skin looked pale, almost gray under the lights. The veins in his neck were faintly visible, a map of bluish lines. 

Isaiah forced a laugh. “You’re late.”

“You’re paranoid,” Hunter said, kicking the door shut. “Traffic. And maybe I stopped for food.”

“You always stop for food.”

“Starving artists gotta eat.” He grinned, teeth faintly discolored from coffee. Maybe it was the light in the room but his gums looked grey. 

They moved through setup together. Isaiah adjusted the ring light; Hunter aligned the mics. The familiar motions steadied them both. Still, there was a faint smell — not quite rot, not quite iron. Like the residue of something burned.

Hunter rubbed his forearm absentmindedly, skin flakes dusting the table. “Cold in here today.”

Isaiah nodded. “Feels weird, right? Like the air’s too dry.”

They laughed it off.

When everything was ready, Isaiah hit record.

The red light blinked on. Cameras, mics, mixer — all alive.

“Welcome back to CreepCast,” Isaiah said, his voice warm and smooth. “The only show where the mayonnaise is, and I quote, the sauce of the aristocrat.”

Hunter groaned. “We are not bringing that back.”

“It’s tradition.”

“It’s trauma.”

Their laughter bounced clean through the room. The sound was perfect — crisp, intimate. They could almost forget the chill.

They flowed from story to story. Haunted truck stops. Cursed phones. Listener submissions about ghosts in drainpipes. Their rhythm was easy. Each time Hunter leaned forward, the ring light caught in his eyes, and for an instant the whites looked dull, almost clouded. Isaiah noticed but said nothing.

At the forty-minute mark, Isaiah leaned closer to the mic. His throat ached faintly. He heard a whispering hiss underneath his own words. It wasn’t feedback. It had a shape to it, like someone imitating him a breath too late.

He froze.

Hunter kept talking. “You good?”

Isaiah forced a grin. “Yeah. Just checking the levels.”

He turned a knob and the hiss vanished, or seemed to. The air was still cold, though. The LED light flickered once, and in that brief dimness, Hunter’s skin looked wrong — stretched too tight, as if thinned by light itself.

The red recording light blinked off.

“That’s a wrap,” Isaiah said.

Hunter leaned back, cracking his neck. “That one felt solid.”

“Yeah.” Isaiah rubbed his throat again. His fingers came away with a faint trace of red, like rust powder. He wiped it on his jeans before Hunter could see.

The silence afterward was heavy. Somewhere in the speakers, the faintest hum continued — a note that hadn’t existed before.

“Do you hear that?” Isaiah asked.

Hunter listened. “Just the building settling.”

Isaiah nodded, but he knew it wasn’t the building. It was lower, rhythmic, like breath passing through a mouth that wasn’t quite human.

Isaiah stayed behind to handle the edit. Hunter never liked post-production, claiming his creative genius ended when the mics went off.

The quiet that followed a recording always had its own gravity. The hum of the equipment, the faint aftertaste of energy drinks, the ghost of conversation still clinging to the air. Isaiah liked it that way — the world reduced to sliders and sound waves.

He slipped on his headphones and opened the raw session file.

For the first half-hour everything sounded clean. Their usual rhythm, the joking interruptions, the way Hunter’s laughter cracked halfway through a story. The comfort of predictability.

Then, at thirty-four minutes, a noise caught his ear.

He paused the track and rolled it back.

At first, it was nothing more than static — a shallow, shifting hiss. But as he amplified it, the noise bent itself into a rhythm. Almost a breath. Almost a voice.

He leaned closer to the monitor.

The whisper was faint but deliberate, the syllables stretching like air pulled through wet cloth.

“Isaiah.”

His own name.

He froze, replayed it again, slower this time. The whisper repeated. Soft. Intimate.

His pulse ticked faster.

He soloed Hunter’s mic to see if it had come from there. The channel was clean. The voice was isolated to his own feed, whispering directly under his laughter.

He frowned, rubbed his face. “No way.”

He scrolled back and forth on the timeline, but the cursor started to lag, moving even when he lifted his hand from the mouse. The project kept playing on its own for half a second before stopping.

Isaiah stared at the screen. Then he saved and closed it.

The room had grown darker without him noticing. The LEDs still glowed white, but everything beneath them looked drained — gray tables, gray floor, the faint reflection of his own face caught between screens.

He stood, stretched, and felt a sharp ache in his knuckles. When he flexed his hands, the skin made a soft cracking sound. He turned them over and saw that the color had gone pale, almost blue.

He rubbed his fingers together. They felt dry, the skin rough like sandpaper.

He blamed it on the air. On the long hours.

He packed his bag and stepped toward the exit.

The neon sign at the back of the room still burned orange. He could have sworn he had turned it off. The glow crawled over the metal panels, dimming and brightening in uneven waves.

Isaiah unplugged it, waited, and watched the light fade. The sign’s outline stayed visible for a few seconds longer than it should have — an afterimage that seemed carved into his vision.

Outside, the sky had gone gray. The parking lot stretched empty in all directions, but something about it felt distorted, as if the depth had flattened.

When he got to his car, he looked down at his palms again. The veins looked darker now, almost black beneath the skin.

He tried not to think about it.

His phone buzzed just as he started the engine. A message from Hunter.

“Yo, are you editing that weird whisper yet?”

He frowned, thumbed back:

“What whisper?”

“The one under my track. Sounds like me laughing when I’m not talking.”

He stared at the message for a long time.

“Probably bleed,” he typed.

“Sure,” Hunter replied. “But it laughed after I did.”

No more messages came.

When Isaiah got home, the static hum of his refrigerator sounded almost like the room’s hiss from earlier — low, steady, alive.

He lay in bed, staring at the dark ceiling, and caught himself breathing in sync with the noise.

When he finally fell asleep, he dreamt of microphones. Their black mouths opening wider, cords twisting across the floor like veins.

By dusk, Hunter was already back at the studio. He claimed he had forgotten his water bottle, but the truth was simpler: he didn’t like being alone in his apartment after hearing that whisper in his audio.

The warehouse looked different at night. The orange tint of the city light pressed through the frosted windows, turning the dust into floating amber grains. The studio’s walls seemed closer, like the panels had crept inward.

The air carried a faint odor — iron, ozone, and something older.

When Isaiah arrived, the first thing he noticed was the smell.

“Man, you leave food in here?”

Hunter looked up from the console. His face was pale beneath the ring light, his eyes sunken in more than usual, skin slightly glossy as though damp. “No,” he said. “I came back to check something. Thought maybe we left the mics on.”

“You hear the whisper too?”

Hunter nodded slowly. His voice sounded rougher, deeper. “It said my name. Then yours. I tried to delete the track but it wouldn’t.”

Isaiah moved closer. On the monitor, a new project window was open. The cursor crawled across the screen on its own, tracing empty waveform space.

“Hardware bug,” Isaiah muttered, leaning in. But the closer he looked, the clearer the static sounded. The same slow breath, soft and wet.

The studio lights flickered.

Hunter lifted his hand to his face. “Do I look weird to you?”

Isaiah hesitated.

The skin around Hunter’s eyes had taken a dull yellow tint, veins branching outward like roots. His lips looked dry, cracked at the corners with fresh blood threatening to peak out. 

“Yeah,” Isaiah said finally. “You’re pale.”

“You too,” Hunter replied quietly. “Like the blood’s gone out of you.”

They stared at each other in the reflection of the monitor, both faces ghostly in the glow. The colors looked wrong — too muted, too even.

Isaiah reached out and touched the edge of the desk. The metal felt sticky. When he lifted his hand, faint residue clung to his fingertips.

“What is this?”

Hunter didn’t answer. He was watching the waveform move. A faint green pulse, perfectly timed with their breathing.

“Is it recording?” Isaiah asked.

“I didn’t hit record,” Hunter said.

Their microphones began to hum.

Both of them froze.

The sound was subtle at first — a low drone rising and falling like a tide. The red recording light blinked even though the interface was closed.

“Hunter,” Isaiah whispered. “Unplug it.”

Hunter reached for the cable, hesitated. “What if—”

The speakers crackled, cutting him off. Their laughter from that morning spilled into the room, warped and slowed.

“Welcome back to CreepCast…”

The words stretched and twisted until they became nothing but breath and vowels.

Isaiah yanked the power strip. The lights died, plunging them into darkness.

For a moment, there was nothing — only the faint breathing of the equipment.

Then a sound came from the far corner of the room. A scrape, like nails dragging across the floor.

Hunter turned on his phone flashlight.

The beam caught the edge of the soundboard. The cables were shifting, inching across the concrete, coiling together like snakes.

Isaiah grabbed his bag. “We’re done for tonight. Let’s go.”

They backed toward the door. As they passed the glass window, both caught their reflections.

The shapes staring back weren’t quite right. The faces were theirs, but the mouths hung slightly open, teeth too long, the eyes shining faintly like wet coins. Hair so thin it looked as though it belonged to a newborn. 

Isaiah turned away first. “It’s the lighting.”

“Yeah,” Hunter said, though his voice trembled. “Lighting.”

They stepped out into the cold night. Neither looked back.

But as they walked to their cars, the orange glow from the warehouse followed them — reflected in the windows, pulsing slow as a heartbeat.

The next night, the city was wrapped in mist. The industrial district looked drowned in it, every light a blurred halo. Isaiah’s car headlights barely pierced the fog as he pulled into the lot.

He told himself he was only returning to grab the hard drive, maybe to make sure everything had actually shut off. But guilt was a quiet pressure behind his ribs. He hadn’t been able to stop thinking about the way Hunter’s skin looked, about the sound that had followed them out the door.

The warehouse was dark except for the faint orange glow seeping through the frosted windows. The CREEPCAST sign was still on, pulsing unevenly.

Inside, the air was colder than the night outside. The hum of the soundboard was gone, replaced by a slower, deeper vibration, like breath trapped in metal.

He closed the door behind him. “Hunter?”

His voice echoed thinly across the room.

No response.

The main monitor glowed across the table, its light spilling over empty chairs and cables. The session project was open again. The cursor was moving by itself, tracing across the waveform. The bars pulsed in perfect time with the faint vibration in the air.

Isaiah’s skin prickled. He stepped closer.

On the track names he saw the file titles had changed:

	•	22\_11\_HUNTER.wav

	•	22\_12\_ISAIAH.wav

	•	22\_13\_HUNTERISAIAH.wav

He reached for the keyboard to stop it, but the playhead kept sliding forward.

“Hunter?” he called again, quieter this time.

A sound came from the booth — a low scrape of a chair.

He turned.

Hunter sat at the far end of the table, headphones still on, his head tilted down.

“Jesus, you scared me,” Isaiah said. “What are you doing here? I thought you left.”

No answer.

Isaiah took a step forward. The light from the monitor found Hunter’s face.

He stopped breathing.

Hunter’s skin had grayed almost completely it was nearly translucent, veins standing dark against the surface. His lips had thinned, cracked wide at the corners. His eyes looked glassy, the pupils shrunken to tiny pinpoints. Beneath the skin at his neck, the faint movement of something pulsing could be seen — veins or cords twitching with a rhythm that wasn’t human.

“Hunter?”

The word came out like a whisper.

Hunter lifted his head slowly. The skin under his eyes stretched tight as he moved, almost tearing. “It’s still recording,” he said. His voice was low and hollow, like it had to crawl up his throat. “I tried to stop it.”

Isaiah stared. “Man, you need to go to a hospital.”

Hunter’s eyes flicked to the screen. “It doesn’t want me to.”

The monitor’s glow flickered, washing the room in alternating pale and orange light. Each flicker showed Hunter’s face slightly differently — sometimes too long, sometimes the skin drawn back a little farther, the mouth opening just enough to glimpse blackened gums.

Isaiah forced himself to move. He stepped around the table to the console. “I’m shutting it off.”

Before he could touch the keyboard, the speakers hissed. The hum grew louder, layered with faint laughter. Their own laughter, played back slower and slower until it dissolved into a gurgling tone.

Then the voices began to blend.

“Welcome back,” the speakers said. Both of their voices, together, distorted and thick.

Isaiah jerked back. “That’s us.”

Hunter nodded weakly. “It learned how to talk.”

The microphones swiveled on their stands with a mechanical creak, facing them. The cables along the floor twitched as though pulled by breath.

Hunter whispered, “It wants us to keep recording.”

Isaiah shook his head. “No. We’re leaving.” He turned toward the door.

The knob didn’t move.

He hit it harder, but it only rattled in place. “It’s locked.”

“Did you lock it?”

“It locks from the outside,” Isaiah said.

Behind them, the neon sign flared, bathing the room in a deep orange light. The air rippled. The speakers released a sound like inhalation.

Hunter stood slowly. His movements were jerky now, like a marionette learning balance. The smell that followed him was sickly-sweet, rot mixed with electricity.

He touched the edge of the table, and where his fingers pressed, the laminate darkened with oily residue.

“Isaiah,” he said, his tone uneven, “don’t fight it. It’s almost done.”

His teeth glinted — longer now, crooked, a shade of gray that caught the light wrong.

Isaiah backed toward the door. “What did you do?”

“It’s not me.” Hunter’s neck jerked as if a spasm ran through it. “It’s us.”

The computer’s display began to distort, image bending like melted glass. The waveform split into two moving tracks labeled HOST 1 and HOST 2. Both pulsed in time with their breathing.

The hum turned into words again, layered, closer:

“Do not stop.”

Hunter’s chest hitched. A long breath shuddered out of him, whistling through his teeth. His fingers flexed, nails blackening at the edges.

Isaiah lunged forward, grabbed the power cord, and yanked.

The room exploded in static.

The noise was unbearable — shrieking, grinding, wet. It pressed through the air like heat. Isaiah fell back, clutching his ears.

Then it ended.

The lights flickered once.

The neon sign went dark.

The speakers whispered, barely audible:

“Keep recording.”

Isaiah opened his eyes.

Hunter was still standing, frozen in place, mouth open, chest barely moving. The whites of his eyes had turned gray, the pupils swallowed by shadow.

For the first time, Isaiah noticed that his own hands were trembling, veins black and raised. Beneath his nails, the skin had started to crack. He rubbed at it frantically, flakes of skin coming off like dry seaweed.

The air stank of metal and old blood.

He looked at Hunter, who was staring back now — a faint smile creeping across his torn lips.

“We’re still live,” Hunter said, voice warbling.

The microphones leaned closer.

The red light blinked on.

The hum thickened until it was nearly tangible, vibrating through every panel of the studio. The air shimmered with heat and static, the faint orange light from the neon sign pulsing like a dying heartbeat.

Isaiah crouched by the wall, hands over his ears. The soundboard lights flashed erratically, throwing color across his face — green, gold, red — until everything merged into the color of blood.

Across the table, Hunter stood motionless, head tilted toward the ceiling as though listening to something above them. The skin of his neck had stretched thin; dark veins climbed up toward his jaw. His mouth twitched open and closed like he was mouthing silent words.

The microphones hissed again, their stands creaking. They leaned toward him, close enough that the edges of the foam brushed his lips.

The sound that came out wasn’t human. A slow, rasping syllable that broke apart before becoming a word. The speakers echoed it immediately, layering it into something deeper.

Then both channels began recording again. The screen glowed with new files forming:

HUNTER.wav

ISAIAH.wav

HOST\_1.wav

HOST\_2.wav

Isaiah forced himself to stand. His knees cracked. The smell of rot clung to him — his own body breaking down. The veins in his arms had turned black, the flesh around his knuckles splitting like dried fruit.

“Hunter,” he said, voice hoarse. “We have to stop this.”

Hunter turned toward him slowly. His eyes had clouded completely, the pupils gone. When he smiled, his teeth looked cracked and gray, the edges sharp like stone.

“It’s still going,” he said. “It needs us.”

The studio’s lights flickered again, faster now. The room seemed to breathe — walls expanding and contracting, the air shifting in waves. Each breath carried the smell of rust and old meat.

Isaiah stumbled back against the wall. His reflection glimmered faintly in the glass of the control booth. He almost didn’t recognize himself. The skin of his face had lost its tone, lips darkened, eyes sinking into shadow. The sound that came from his throat was wet and low.

He wiped at his mouth. His fingertips came away with a thin smear of black.

The speakers erupted with laughter — their laughter — looped and distorted.

“Welcome back to CreepCast…”

“…where the mayonnaise is…”

“…the sauce of the aristocrat.”

The voices overlapped until they became a single, toneless murmur.

Hunter stumbled forward, one hand clutching the edge of the desk. “It’s finishing the episode,” he said.

The microphones swung toward them. The red recording light turned steady. The waveform on the monitor began to pulse, keeping time with their movements.

The speakers whispered, “We are the hosts.”

Isaiah’s stomach twisted. He felt something crawling beneath his skin, threading along his ribs and into his neck — cords tightening, pulling him upright. His breath came out in shudders. His voice cracked open on instinct.

“Stop,” he whispered. But even his whisper echoed through the speakers, deeper than it should have been.

The echo answered: “Keep going.”

His knees buckled. The cables on the floor had begun to shift again, inching toward his feet, wrapping lightly around his ankles. The rubber was slick, warm to the touch.

Across from him, Hunter had fallen to his knees, breathing in short bursts. Every exhale came out as a wheeze. His skin had gone gray and sunken; his fingers ended in dark nails that clicked against the floor.

Isaiah watched in horror as Hunter’s jaw spasmed open. The flesh around his mouth split slightly at the corners, black liquid beading along the cracks. Isaiah watched as Hunter vomited his innards onto the floor into a mess of melted intestines and softened teeth. Resembling that of tapioca pudding. 

Through the pain, Hunter managed to laugh — a wet, thick sound. “It’s… us.”

The laughter continued through the speakers, looping in perfect sync.

“We are the hosts.”

“We are the cast.”

“We are still recording.”

Isaiah felt his spine stiffen as if cords had been threaded through it. His skin burned. His teeth ached against his gums. The pressure in his head rose until he could hear nothing but the vibration of the neon light.

Then his vision doubled.

He saw Hunter across from him — but also saw himself from Hunter’s perspective, as if their eyes had merged. The screens flickered between them, each reflection slightly out of time.

They moved together without meaning to. Both leaned toward their microphones, skin tearing faintly at the necks, breath rattling in their throats. The smell of decay thickened until the air itself tasted metallic.

Hunter’s voice came out first — a distorted blend of whisper and growl. “Tonight’s episode…”

Isaiah’s mouth opened against his will. “…is about voices that never stop.”

The lights flared once more, searing white.

The microphones began to hum in harmony, the cables tightening around their bodies, binding them to the table.

They kept speaking — slow, uneven, almost ritualistic — as their faces caved inward and the flesh along their arms darkened like charred paper.

“…haunted gas stations…”

“…mirrors that talk back…”

“…voices that don’t die…”

Each phrase dissolved into static.

Their eyes turned white. Their skin dried into ash-gray texture, lips receding to reveal cracked teeth. The glow of the monitor painted their faces in the same dead light as the waveform’s pulse.

Still, they smiled.

When the sound finally dropped to silence, both stood completely still. The wave on the screen flattened into a line. The file saved itself automatically:

The Hosts That Creep Their Casts.wav

Two hours long. Perfectly complete.

For a long moment, nothing moved.

Then, slowly, both figures lifted their heads.

Their eyes reflected the monitor’s light.

From their blackened mouths came the faintest whisper, perfectly synchronized:

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

I was seeing a girl for a while, we started out as friends not really thinking I'd fall in love with her but I did and we actually ended up dating, at first it was turbulent because I was still living with my ex girlfriend at the time and lied to her, I told her I lived with my sister, ( I just didn't know how to tell her ) she found out and I explained to her the situation but that broke the trust she had with me, so fast foward a little bit and I move out and she offers to let me stay with her, which I did.
  
(A little about me tho I'm 31 I gotten out a 3 year abusive relationship which was physical and verbal, meeting P was amazing and a breath of fresh air, I truly felt like myself for the first time in a long time. 2 years before I would occasionally frequent an adult chat site which had a paid monthly membership in order to use its features to contact other members, one day I noticed a profile of a girl, her profile showed she was 19yo and I read her bio she talked about college and traveling places, I messaged her and she messaged me a phone number which I texted and she told me she had a secret that she was actually 13yo. 
 I replied sarcastically to it thinking it was some sort of roleplay we messaged back and forth, talked about meeting up, something in my gut told me its a bad idea, I turned back driving home but she kept spamming my phone calling me, I answered and she said I was wasting her time and all that, I got very anxious so I turned back to meet her when I got to the area I felt it again so I tried to leave but in doing so I got stopped by police and arrested for contacting a minor I got charged as an SO for 20 years and probation for 2, and did 41 days in jail, I never had intentions of talking to a minor or anything it was a huge mistake. Huge) 

While staying with her, one morning I took a hit of weed, which she doesn't like me smoking in the morning, that upset her then a little later told me to give my driver license to her so she can do a background check, I told her I'm gonna go get us coffee for the morning, while driving back I got a text from her not to come back and I asked her what's up and she sent me a screenshot shot of my registration, I tried to tell her it was a mistake and that I wanted to tell her but I wanted her to know my personality first.

Suddenly, you're 27.

You make your coffee, rush to work, come home around 7, and you're too tired to do anything except eat, scroll on your phone, and pass out.

Then you wake up, and do it all again.

And when Friday comes, maybe you go out, or maybe you're just too tired. Then, out of nowhere, it hits you.

How did everything pass by so quickly?

You don't even feel 27.

You still feel like that 17 year old kid who thought they had all the time in the world.

But somehow, 10 years just disappeared. And you start missing the past. The feeling of being young, excited, and clueless.

But then you realize, one day, you'll miss this, too.

Being 18, being confused, being tired, but still trying.

So maybe the trick is to slow down a bit and actually live this chapter before it also becomes just another memory.

The point is no matter what age you are, you’ll miss these days. Life gets busy sometimes and it’s always a good time to stop and smell the roses

~Akhror

When someone asks ""tumhare liye definition of life kya hai?"" it's hard to answer immediately—unless you're used to such questions. Not everyone has the logic or curiosity to ask what really drives your thinking.But for me, the answer was always clear.Life was never about being rich, good-looking, famous, or owning cars, gadgets, and expensive clothes. It wasn't about following social media trends or pretending to be someone I'm not. It was always about being happy with what I had—the people around me and everything else that came with it .Looking back, I realize I ended up with the wrong people more times than I'd like to admit. If I'm being honest, I wasted a lot of time investing in them. But I don't regret it—I learned more from those experiences than I could have imagined .There's a different version of you that exists in everyone's mind. At some point, this stopped working for me because I was the same everywhere—no change in how I talked or behaved. And because of that, I lost a lot of people along the way .So here's the conclusion: I'm turning 18 tomorrow, and I have this obsession with sharing how I feel. And honestly, there's no better place than Reddit for that .I'm also thankful to Reddit—I've met some amazing people here and had some great experiences .

Getting almost immediate reactions to certain foods (1 minute after eating/drinking them):

* sparkling water
* coffee
* tea
* chocolate
* honey
* any alcoholic drink
* citrus fruits (orange, mandarine, etc)
* fruit jams
* sushi / sauces on it

After 1 minute of consuming those, I start to get a strong migraine/headache, feeling itchy, nose gets stuffy, back of my head starts throbing.

Sometimes the symptons go away in 1 hour, but sometimes can take 10-18 hours for symptons to go away.

I've been checked for DAO enzyme activity but levels are normal, apparently I'm not defficient on it.

Have been to many different type of doctors and nutritionists, and only diagnostic was a possible SIBO, but none of the treatments or different diets that I've tried have helped substiantially (apart from avoiding these foods obviously). All feces analysis and blood tests don't report anything wrong. Endoscopy has reported a low activity chronic gastritis, but nothing to worry about the doctor says.

Apart from these foods that give histamine-related effects, I feel constantly bloated, with low energy levels, with my abdominal streching, not comfortable for fast walks or any sports that involve running. Really difficult situation to be in for years. Some foods are very difficult to digest:

* raw vegetables
* rare meat
* Bakery doesn't make me feel good either
* Any herbal tea makes my stomach/intestine feel worse also, not good.
* Nuts and seeds
* Legumes / beans
* Sugary foods
* Most the the fruits
* Milk / dairy products

Other foods are bereable, but I don't feel I'm improving/healing exactly. Have been like this for almost 5 years for now and honestly don't know what to do or which medical specialities to ask for help.

**All characters in this story are 18 or older.**

He had seen me watching him, yes, there had been eye-contact. But I got the fucky out of there as fast as I could, eye-contact or no eye-contact, I did not want that girl, or anyone else, to know what I had just seen.

I had learned for myself just how deep this thing was; brazenly walking through the girl's locker room, brazenly receiving blowjobs from students at 4:47 in the afternoon.

This guy had balls, huge balls, enormous balls. I had just seen them, but I must not have seen them clearly, because his balls had to be as big as basketballs.

Either that or he had a stranglehold on the whole system, the goods on someone, or he was paying someone off. Who knows? But something was going on, some kind of conspiracy, I didn't know what exactly, but it was something dark and deep and mysterious.

Driving home, I felt guilty, if you can believe that. It was he who was receiving a blowjob from a student, in his office, on government property, at 4:47 in the afternoon, yet it was me who was feeling guilty. How fucked up and cowardly is that?

I decided right then that I would say nothing about the blowjob, at least not yet. I would get to the bottom of this, the full story, every detail, but until then, I would say nothing about witnessing blowjob.

Reagan was probably home at that very moment, doing her homework. I had to appear calm. As a father, my job was to help her stay in that beautiful innocent world of hers for as long as possible. At least I hoped it was still innocent.

Driving down my street, and then pulling into the driveway, I parked the car and took several deep breaths before climbing out.

Entering through the back door, I walked into the kitchen and found Reagan sitting at the 'big table' working on her science project.

We have two tables; the 'big table' and the 'little table'. The big one is an oak table which we use for dinner. The little table is just a small patio-looking thing we bought from IKEA and use for breakfast and snacks.

Since Karen was out of town, I was allowing Reagan to use the entire 'big table' to spread out all her materials. She had all kinds of crazy shit spread all across it; papers on top of papers, but also her laptop, her printer, straws, markers, crayons, and Popsicle sticks. She was really going to town on whatever it was she was creating. She was a great student and almost always received As in her classes.

""Hey sweetie."" I said.

She looked up from the table and gave me one of those deep-in-thought looks, then responded,

""Hey, dad.""

I walked closer to her.

""Boy, that is quite the science project you've got there. What are you building, an atom bomb?""

She gave me the sincere chuckle I was hoping for.

I moved in and sat across from her. She was wearing the standard white Polo shirt with the school's logo over her left breast. There were at least ten identical shirts hanging in her closet. I could barely catch a glimpse of bra cups against the swell of a large breast.

We talked for a minute or two. I learned she was building a model comparing predators to prey in the animal world.

Suddenly the phone in the pocket of my shirt made it's noise. Pulling it out and glancing at it, there was a number on the screen I did not recognize.

""Hello"" I answered.

""Hello"" the voice on the other end responded, ""This is Travis Johnson, Reagan's coach. Am I speaking with her father?""

*Dear God*

""Oh, hello. Yes it is."" I managed to say.

The voice continued, ""Would you mind if I stopped by your home in the next few minutes to have a word with you? It should not take long?""

*Dear fuck*!

I should have told him that now was not a good time. I should have told him he was a perverted fuck who would be fired once I was finished with my investigation. I should have told him one of a dozen things. But before I knew what I was doing, these words were exiting my mouth;

""Why yes, now would be a fine time for a visit.""

""Great, I should be there in about five or ten minutes."" He said.

""Sounds good, see you then.""

Then I pressed the red button on the phone's screen and ended the call.

Slowly I placed the phone back in my pocket.

Ok, just stay calm, you must appear calm and uninterested when you mention it to her. You are a man who did not just see her coach receiving a blowjob from a cheerleader.

""Who was that?"" she asked.

""That, Sweetie, was your gymnastics coach."" I answered.

I might as well have told her a tidal wave was about to hit the house. Her head shot up from what she was doing. Staring at me, her eyes were wide, almost terrified.

""Coach is coming here?""

""Yes,"" I said with an authentic chuckle. ""I figured that was OK. Are you OK with that?""

She looked away and started to back-track, ""Oh, well, of course it's OK. I'm just busy with this.""

In a fatherly tone I said ""Well, he actually didn't even mention anything about you. He wants to speak with me."" I said it as if she might not even be invited to sit with us.

Trying desperately to hide her anxiety, she asked, ""So, he said nothing about me?""

""Nope, not one word."" I answered.

There was an odd moment of silence, then I asked,

""Sweetie, you seem to get really nervous when the subject of 'the coach' comes up, is everything OK between you two?""

*Are you also giving him blowjobs at school while wearing nothing but your panties?*

""Yes, everything is fine,"" she sighed and looked down, ""It's just . . . he is a man who demands a lot from his students and I get anxious when I interact with him outside gymnastics.""

Good, good, this is good, she's not bullshitting me, she is finally speaking openly and freely about this.

But I was still nervous, ""I understand. Well, if anything weird ever happens, you know you can always talk to me about it? I'm your dad, that's my job.""

""He doesn't do anything weird,"" she said, almost in a chuckle. Then, with her eyes lowered and focused on nothing at all, she added, ""But he has enlarged my mind, I suppose that could be considered weird.""

*Man, this guy really has his hooks in her.*

Suddenly a feeling came over me that the answers to the questions I was asking would be more awful than the situation in the locker room. She spoke about the man as if he were something from the supernatural world, a warlock or a necromancer or a man-god, something to lift up, bow down before, and offer sacrifice to.

Perhaps this thing was even bigger than I had suspected.

Changing the subject and slowly standing up, ""Well, he will be here soon. Let me check the front room and make sure there is no clutter in there.""

Five minutes later, the doorbell rang. Reagan had gone up to her room to wait. She was probably listening from the top of the stairs.

When I opened the door, there he was. The dark glasses he always wore made his seem a charismatic 'Jim Jones' Messiah type.

Wearing a red exercise suit of some sort, he seemed much larger than before and seemed to fill the entire doorway.

""Hello."" He said as he stepped forward respectfully.

""Hello."" I answered as I held the door open for him.

We shook hands, both of us were thinking of the blowjob we had just witnessed but were pretending we were not.

I invited him into the living room and we sat across from each other. Ten feet or so of space plus a coffee table separated us.

After a few minutes of uncomfortable small talk, he decided to broach the subject,

""Well, I don't want to take up too much of your evening. I suppose I called because I felt it necessary for us to discuss what you just witnessed back at the school.""

""All right, please do."" I said.

I was trying hard not to appear a detective interviewing a culprit, but that's how I felt.

""But before that, I would like to speak with Reagan for a minute. Is she home?""

I felt a twinge of apprehension sweep up from my guts and clutch at my heart.

""Uh, sure."" I said while reaching for my phone. ""She's upstairs, let me send her a text.""

It did not take long for Reagan to enter the room, the coach remained seated as he spoke,

""Hello, Sweetie.""

""Hi, coach.""

She was still wearing her school uniform. A white polo shirt tucked into a blue-plaid skirt. She had not removed her shoes; blue high tops. Her hair was brushed back, but was no longer in a ponytail like it had been before she went upstairs.

""Why don't you come over here, Sweetie. Come stand next to me.""

As she walked towards him, her shoulders were hunched more than they normally were.

Once she was within arms length he slowly reached around her waist and turned her towards me.

Gazing at her face, he reached up and gently caressed her cheek as he spoke,

""You truly are a beautiful young lady.""

""Thank you."" She answered softly.

Lowering his hand, he turned to me and said, ""The school's dress code for many years has stated that girls must wear the standard uniform. The problem has been the boys. They love to lift up the girl's skirts and expose their panties. So years ago the girls started wearing shorts beneath their skirts.""

I nodded in comprehension but wondered where this was going.

He continued, ""The problem is, the girls are not learning to sit like ladies, they sit with their legs spread all over the place. So I demand that my girls wear nothing beneath their uniforms but a matching pair of bra and panties. No shorts, no under-shirts, no thongs, no sports bras.""

He turned to Reagan, ""Isn't that right, Sweetie?""

""Yes, coach.""

""Have you been following the rules?

""Yes.""

""What do you have under your uniform?""

""A pair of bra and panties.""

""Matching?""

""Yes, coach.""

""Good, very good. But let's just have a quick look to make sure.""

I felt a pleasant stiffening in my dick. My balls began to churn.

Gripping the bottom of her skirt, her body stiffened and she looked to me, then looked away.

Without any hesitation the coach began lifting the skirt and soon the tops of her thighs were exposed. But the skirt continued riding upwards until her white panties were completely exposed.

There was a pause of profound stillness. I was amazed by his boldness, but my prick was throbbing, it was hard and pointed downwards into my underwear. My balls quivered and ached.

Holding the skirt up, we both took in the view of her beautiful panties. Just plain white panties, but they were clean and new as if she had just removed them from the box she had bought them in.

The skin around the panties was flawless without a hint of cellulite anywhere. Her pussy-area was beautiful and tight, and the cotton material stretching across it was filled nicely to its limits.

Focusing on her pussy, in admiration the coach finally spoke, ""Beautiful, absolutely beautiful.""

He was enjoying the fuck out of this.

""Good job, Sweetie, only panties. Do the boys lift your skirt as you walk past?"" He asked.

""Yes.""

""And sometimes they take pictures don't they."" He said.

""Yes.""

""What do you do?""

""There's not much I can do. It's always the same boys, so when I see them coming I just put my hands by my sides to hold my skirt down, then I start running.""

""Yes, those boys can be rascals"" He said as he lowered the skirt.

Glancing to him to see what he would do next, I watched his focus shift upwards, his dark eyes roved back and forth across her breasts.

A silence hung in the room. Reagan's breasts were rising and falling in a solid rhythm; swelling outward and tightening the material of her shirt before deflating back. It seemed the entire universe was focused on her tits.

""All right, how about the bra, does it match the panties?""

Softly Reagan answered, ""Yes.""

A part of me hoped the man would believe her, another part hoped he would not.

""Well, let's have a look to make sure.""

*Oh Fuck*

Reaching up, he pinched that portion of shirt just above her waist and began tugging it out of the skirt. When the hem of her shirt came loose, a flash of pale stomach presented itself then was gone.

Glancing to his face, it held an amused aspect, powerful, almost vengeful. He was thrilled with what he was doing to her. I was not stopping him, neither was she. She was his toy, and there was absolutely nothing preventing him from doing whatever he wanted with her

The shirt continued to rise, and soon he was barring a beautiful gymnast's stomach. But he continued lifting it until it traversed her entire body. Raising it all the way to her chin, he made sure we could both see her complete chest.

*Dear Fuck*!

There they were, out in the open and fully exposed, a pair of cock-stirring breasts held in place by a beautiful white bra.

Her petite little frame made them appear absolutely massive. Bulging out of the top of the cups, they almost appeared engorged. Her stomach was so tight and thin compared to them, and the bra straps seemed too small to hold them up.

They were beautiful tits, literally the most beautiful things I had ever seen. Round and smooth and riding high on her chest. I had never seen her in a bra. The closest I had seen was when she wore a bikini. But there was something different about this. This was degrading, an intrusion, an invasion of her body. Her coach was having his way with her, and I was allowing it, allowing it for my own sexual gratification. The whole thing was extremely dark, just plain raw. Beyond raw, it was primal, primitive, primeval.

I noticed the coach had leaned in closer, close enough for the air exiting his mouth to blow across her chest.

Suddenly, without a shred of hesitation, his large black hand reached up and engulfed the bottom-half of one of her breasts.

Her body stiffened. Then, slowly but firmly, he squeezed the breast and watched in fascination the pale tit-flesh bulging upwards above the cup.

""What size are they?"" He asked.

""Thirty-four double-D."" She answered.

""That's a beautiful size. Extremely large for a girl your size and age. I've seen your breasts in the locker room, but never up close like this.""

""Do the boys look at them a lot?"" He asked.

""Yes.""

""Do they ever randomly grab them?""

""Yes, sometimes.""

""Well, boys will be boys"" he said as he removed his hand from her breast.

Then he lowered the shirt down over her bra.

Suddenly, you're 27.

You make your coffee, rush to work, come home around 7, and you're too tired to do anything except eat, scroll on your phone, and pass out.

Then you wake up, and do it all again.

And when Friday comes, maybe you go out, or maybe you're just too tired. Then, out of nowhere, it hits you.

How did everything pass by so quickly?

You don't even feel 27.

You still feel like that 17 year old kid who thought they had all the time in the world.

But somehow, 10 years just disappeared. And you start missing the past. The feeling of being young, excited, and clueless.

But then you realize, one day, you'll miss this, too.

Being 18, being confused, being tired, but still trying.

So maybe the trick is to slow down a bit and actually live this chapter before it also becomes just another memory.

The point is no matter what age you are, you’ll miss these days. Life gets busy sometimes and it’s always a good time to stop and smell the roses

~Akhror

When someone asks ""tumhare liye definition of life kya hai?"" it's hard to answer immediately—unless you're used to such questions. Not everyone has the logic or curiosity to ask what really drives your thinking.But for me, the answer was always clear.Life was never about being rich, good-looking, famous, or owning cars, gadgets, and expensive clothes. It wasn't about following social media trends or pretending to be someone I'm not. It was always about being happy with what I had—the people around me and everything else that came with it .Looking back, I realize I ended up with the wrong people more times than I'd like to admit. If I'm being honest, I wasted a lot of time investing in them. But I don't regret it—I learned more from those experiences than I could have imagined .There's a different version of you that exists in everyone's mind. At some point, this stopped working for me because I was the same everywhere—no change in how I talked or behaved. And because of that, I lost a lot of people along the way .So here's the conclusion: I'm turning 18 tomorrow, and I have this obsession with sharing how I feel. And honestly, there's no better place than Reddit for that .I'm also thankful to Reddit—I've met some amazing people here and had some great experiences .

1ow8w8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1ow8w8r/my_guide_to_making_cheap_tea_taste_good/,My guide to making cheap tea taste good,"Inspired by the post asking which is better, Twinnings or Lipton, here's a quick-and-dirty guide on how to make cheap/low quality tea taste good. Why? Because the economy is terrible and the world is burning, and sometimes the cheap shit is all you can afford. Never fear! You too deserve a delicious pick-me-up beverage. 

I'm warning y'all right now that this guide is not for the purists.

**My Qualifications:** I'm Indian-American and a (very broke) grad student. According to family lore, we make chai/tea the way we do because all the good tea got sold abroad and we had to make-do with the shitty tea dust.

**The Tea:** These tips work with whatever you can get your hands on! This includes tea bags, big things of tea ""dust,"" cheap/low quality loose leaf, anything really. Generally, we tend to use black tea, but I'm sure it works with green tea as well.

**Methods/Tips:** 

The tea itself is going to be pretty harsh and bitter, and probably doesn't have very good ""body"" so most of these tips are about balancing out the flavor and adding some sort of fat to help with texture.

1) Brew the tea directly in milk: This helps with balancing out the bitterness of cheap tea and adds a good bit of body. You can also water down the milk if it's too rich. Generally, I do half milk half water, bring to a simmer just under boiling, add tea (usually like 2 bags of lipton for 1 person), sugar, any spices/aromatics, and then leave it on medium heat to steep for a while before serving

  
2) Brew the tea in water, but let it boil/steep a long time into a ""concentrate"" and add milk/condensed milk/egg/milk powder after: This method is good for ""weak"" tea that has a watery taste. Any acrid taste is usually taken care of by whatever milk/sweetener combo you add later. This method can also make concentrate in a big batch to be kept in the fridge so you don't have to break out a saucepan every time and can just reheat the concentrate with milk in the microwave.

3) Moka pot: I've found moka pots to be pretty decent for making tea ""concentrate"" in a big batch. This tends to make a thick/syrupy type ""decoction"" that you can water down with milk/water in any desired ratio. Just put the tea in the ""strainer"" cup and add hot water to the bottom and then brew like you would coffee, then add any additives desired.

4) Warming spices & aromatics: Almost any spice can be added to regular black tea to enhance/balance out flavors, so go crazy! My family generally does fresh ginger & crushed green cardamon, but I've also seen people add cinnamon, star anise, black pepper, clove, nutmeg/mace, even rose water or garam masala. 

5) Salt: This one is controversial, but salt is a great way to balance out bitter tea. You can add a touch just to neutralize the acrid/sharp taste or full send it to make a salty tea. Kashmiri pink tea is made with green tea, baking soda, and salt and is enjoyed as a salty drink.

6) Brown/caramelize sugar before adding milk & brewing tea: Add sugar into a saucepan first, wait for it to brown/caramelize and then add milk/water to stop the sugar from burning. The more nutty/caramel-y flavors are delicious!

7) Butter: My mother-in-law insists that when she was young, people who couldn't afford milk added butter to coffee (bulletproof coffee), I can't see why it wouldn't work for tea, though I couldn't vouch for this as I haven't tried it myself.   


**Milk/Other Additives:** I tend to think fresh whole milk tastes the best for tea, but if you can't get any that's alright! Milk powder, condensed milk, or evaporated milk work. If you can't get your hands on any of those, an egg yolk beat with sugar could work in a pinch, though I've only seen this used in Vietnamese coffee. 

**My most cursed and sacrilegious tea recommendations:**

 \-As a certified tea lover, I generally think that unless you're drinking the high quality, delicate stuff, making tea in the microwave is fine and not an affront to god or whatever. This is especially true if you're only making the one cup for yourself

 \-Teabag in a mug with water, microwaved 2 mins, add vanilla coffee creamer -- my go-to when I worked in an office that didn't have a kettle or keep milk. Was actually pretty good.

\-Earl grey tea, brewed extra strong & steeped overnight, add milk/milk powder, sugar, ice, and boba pearls -- makes a decent knock-off version of most places' bubble tea

\-Strongly brewed tea (like 4 bags for 1 serving), lemon/lemon juice, lots of sugar/simple syrup/honey, any whiskey -- quick hot toddy 

\-If you forget a mug of tea and you don't want to toss it, adding a touch of boiling water instead of just heating in the microwave can help bring the temp up without making it even more gross/bitter

  
I'm sure I'm forgetting some things, but these are just tips/tricks that work for me! Enjoy!

1ow8tpx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ow8tpx,Restaurant Review: Turk Fatih Tutak** (November 2025),"We had an incredible night with the team at Turk Fatih Tutal while in Istanbul and it really seemed worth sharing to provide a current experience for people heading to Istanbul. While taste is necessarily subjective, I'll say that we have enjoyed great meals at Pujol, Disfrutar, Levadura de Olla, Helene Darroze at The Connaught, Arzak and a host of other very good restaurants - and less than great experiences at Arpege in Paris and a couple others. Which I share only to say that we've had a range of dining experiences against which to gauge this one.

And honestly the negative reviews we'd read about Turk didn't align with our experience this month.  It started with complementary car service from our apartment, which we didn't ask for but certainly appreciated. It set the service experience in motion. Like many such restaurants, the environment upon arrival was tasteful, thoughtful, and very well designed.

Skipping ahead to the food (photos attached), first I'll say that there was no shortage of delicious tastes. A chicken soup with crispy chicken skin near the start was so much better than I'd expected that it raised the stakes on the subsequent dishes. And from the various vegetable and fish preparations to the curly lamb, they all lived up to the newly set expectations. The prize dish for us was a Menemen with Tiger Prawn with an egg that had been sous vide for some extreme amount of time. It was incredibly good. They wrapped up the night with a trip to the kitchen and three sweet courses. And then we wrapped it up with a Turkish Coffee.  All were well tended to.

I would be remiss if I failed to mention Deniz (our primary server) and Tolgahan (the somm). While every team member there was polite and warm, as you would expect, these two were so engaging and knowledgeable and struck the right service chord that they really needed special mention. When we drop a lot of money - and let's be honest the price tag at $1300 USD comes with substantial expectations and is a luxury that we recognize as being really lucky to have - we want to feel really transported and like the four hour experience is somehow just the two of us on a figurative island with the most pleasant people and experience around us. We want to lose track of time in the best way possible.

And that's what Turk was for us. I'd put this up with Quintonil and Disfrutar as among the best total dining experiences I've had. We know that not every restaurant gets it right all the time, and some have had other experiences. But at least as of November 2025 this was a real winner for us.",6,1763058474.0,finedining,0,1.0,False

I have been suffering from OCD all my life but I realize it was this once I got in a relationship.

I was very focused on my insecurities and I had very bad retroactive jealousy so I passed 1 year through hell because of intrusive thoughts.

All I can remember was that I was getting up and thinking about the worst things till I went to sleep.

Once I took aripiprazole (0,5 mg) my intrusive thoughts went all away.

But now my doctor wants to remove it because Ritalin isn't working on me for focusing on studies and at university.

Honestly I feel without energy most of the time and I am a person who needs to drink lots of coffee but yet having no energy effect, also I have tried Ritalin and reached the dosage of 25 mg but had no significant positive effects but just a crazy headache and irritability since the first ten minutes after taking it.

I am honestly scared to remove my medicine since it is the only thing that removed my anxiety and obsessive thoughts.

I just want more energy and remove this brain fog once for all since I feel tired, hopeless, incapable of focusing on studying.. But I can't take off this medicine.",1,1763058332.0,OCD,0,1.0,False

Thank you for taking me on that hike. We had some good laughs.

Thank you for showing me your neighborhood. I think I'd actually like living there with you.

Thank you for showing me the place with the view where you park your car and take phone calls you can't take at home.

Thank you for listening. And for sharing.

Thank you for begrudgingly admitting that yeah, you do miss me a little.

Thank you for showing me that scenic view (the third great view!) at that hilltop church.

Thank you for giving me your hand to hold. That was a lot more intimacy than I expected out of you, and I can't decide if you did it because you felt I wanted it, or because you wanted it. I hope it's the latter.

Thank you for giving me your time.

Thank you for the hug goodbye. Every time I think we'll never see each other again, I'm proven wrong. Maybe this time I won't think that.

Today I shed tears over you again even though I hadn't done so in weeks. Loving you has been simultaneously the easiest and hardest thing I've ever had to do.

I wonder what our therapists will say about this today.",2,1763058105.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False
1ow8nal,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1ow8nal/should_i_go_for_an_endoscopy/,Should I go for an endoscopy?,"(M29) I’ve been dealing with heartburn for about 10 years now. Main food culprits make it real bad, like coffee in the early morning or anything tomato based or spicy. I manage it with tums, and that’s it really. There was one time where I took omeprazole for about 4 weeks - it worked good, but was a weird change to my body, and after that I stopped and went back to tums.

The thing is, I really don’t need *that many* tums. Usually I can get by with 1 or 2 750 mg tums a day, maybe one in the morning a couple hours after coffee and one at night if I had a tomato based or spicy lunch/dinner. Some days I don’t need any. That’s it really. It’s manageable. But I just feel like having to take a tum every day is not sustainable long term. What do you think? ",1,1763058086.0,GERD,4,1.0,False

From the beginning, he picked people who would grab coffee for the cleaner and give a high-five to the chairman without a second thought.
