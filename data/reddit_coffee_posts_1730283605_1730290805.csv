I take 54mg daily;
On days I do not take it i feel like a zombie, extremely tired. Even after a couple coffees with espresso shots, and will drink 2 energy drinks on days I miss it, I feel so tired and drained.

What does everyone else experience?

I'm worried wondering if I'll ever be able to function without taking it.

But sometimes while taking it, I still am.not very productive, however I'm always busy. How does that even make sense?",1,1730290660.0,Concerta,1,1.0,False

Same happens If I try with steam and hot water buttons.

Now, from the video, I tried to run the descale process on the unit to check if the unit was asking for a maintenance. Both '1-Cup' and '2-Cup' buttons start flashing even when getting into the descale mode. Now, the unit keeps flashing the '2-Cup' button.

I tried doing a factory reset and disconnecting it for a few minutes, but it keeps in the same state.

Any ideas whats going on?

I'm usually the one to invite and pay, but this time she insisted she wanted to invite and pay for my dinner.

We set the date and time for the following week. She texts me as it got closer and said she actually has work that day and asked if we could reschedule. Understandable given her job, I say ok we can reschedule. She now gives a new date on the weekend when she's free.

The night before she messaged me again saying she's really tired and needs a rest day and again asks if we can reschedule. I honestly found this excuse somewhat weird because we're just grabbing dinner and I also thought it was inconsiderate to cancel very late the night before. I told her it's kinda inconsiderate of my time to cancel that late when I turned down other invites to be with her. She apologized again and said she will message me when she's free. I just told her to just get some rest of she's really that tired.

She called me the following morning saying I can join her for afternoon coffee. I declined saying I already made plans for the day after she cancelled on me. She then said ""oh, can I ask what you're doing?"" In surprised/disappointed tone. I told her me and my coworker were planning on finishing our project.

My coworker happens to be female and for some reason I feel like my crush was jealous I was hanging out with her one on one instead. The previous day we also met one on one to work on our project. I think my crush was aware of this because I posted it on my Instagram story. I noticed around the time we were supposed to grab dinner my crush posted an old photo of us together. I found it a bit strange because she normally doesn't post our photos together.

I get a texts later from my crush saying we can grab dinner on Monday, but she will let me know what time she gets off of work and she was really sorry she keeps cancelling on me. I didn't have my hopes high but I said ok.

Monday came and I didn't get a text or call from her. I messaged her around 4pm asking if we're still grabbing dinner. Her response was ""were we supposed to?"" with an immediate follow up of ""oh you're right! I am so sorry!"" I told her we don't have to go if she doesn't want to, but don't keep making plans if she's not intending on following thorough with them. She apologized again and said she's been on her period and having really bad cramps so she has been resting at home. I told her sorry to hear that and hope she feels better soon.

We did eventually reschedule for later that week and she showed up and paid. My question is more on her seeming disappointed when I made other arrangements when I cancelled. Was it because I was meeting with another girl that she seemed that way, or was it because she thought I was just going to wait around and have no plans because she cancelled?

Dream 1:
this dream happened a little over two days ago, some of the main things that happened in this dream is I remember we were talking about communication and how important it is and than she asked if I wanted to call, it also seemed like we were a couple in these text messages but i’m not so sure

Dream 2
(this one happened last night so I should have all the details)
The dream started with my dad ( who I haven’t seen in months because I live with my mom and his job is all around the country) buying me a set of new earrings. For some reason said crush moved to new york and we were officially a couple during this dream, the next I remember is me taking a trip to new york to find her but she wasn’t there so we end up rescheduling to another day, we end up meeting at a coffee shop and the last thing I remember is me breaking down while she hugs me crying  my saying “i miss you, please come back” all that stuff.

I want an interpretation since I don’t know much about dreams so I don’t know what any of this means nor why she’s been in my dreams for two times this week, am I going crazy lmaooo",1,1730289526.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False

1gfkjus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gfkjus/we_both_confessed_but_i_feel_like_were_growing/,We both confessed but I feel like were growing distant,"Were both in different colleges as freshmen and met thanks to a mutual friend, we had a genuinely good time and eventually when all of our friends left, we both agreed to just stay together to stay up till 1am and just talked about our lives n all. 

We've hung out ever since and throughout 6 days we did a lot of things. Like watch a movie at her place, baked together, drank together, vibed to songs together, she taught me a bit of mma, did silly things, and just learned more about each other.

I realized that I had feelings for her at the 5th day when we were watching a movie. She was there for me when I was being vulnerable and I really appreciated that, I recalled all the days since meeting her and I was genuinely so happy that I could be myself and she accepts me for it.

On the 7th day since meeting each other, we had planned a sleepover. We played some games, ordered pizza, drank, and tried doing things while drunk. She taught our friends how to bake cookies and I was trying to fix her doorknob while drunk. She usually comes to me just to check up on me and that made me fall in love more. Then, I suddenly blurted out ""I realized something"" (realized that im in love with her). She asked what was it but I came back to my senses and tried to brush it off and said ""Oh nothing its stupid"". She kept pressing me what it was and I simply said ""its really just something irrelevant"", she just nodded and said she wont pry anymore and left to go continue baking.

After that we all talked more and watched a movie, although nearing the end of the movie, She said she wants to go for a walk asked if anyone wants to go w/ her. Me and our other friend went with her, bought some snacks and ate, and was heading back to her house. Although I said ""I'm gonna walk some more"" and didnt expect any of them to come with as I just wanted to think clearly what I was gonna do with these feelings for her. Our other friend said he'll go back at her place but my crush said she'll go with me. So we walked around her subdivision and eventually found this closed cafe but the setting was perfect and all, twas a chill spot ig so I asked if she wanted to sit down for a bit, she said yes.

We sat down and talked abt one of her vulnerabilities, said she'd only show that side of her to someone she really trusts. I kind of hinted to her that i'm here, saying ""What if there IS somone you can trust? one who wont judge you and be there for you?"" She answered It would be someone special, showing her vulnerabilites to a person like that and the last time she had someone like that was her ex but she felt like they just dated for the convenience. 

I asked if this was a vulnerable moment for her right now and she answered in a soft, kind of shy voice ""yeah, I would say so"". She then asked what was my realization earlier and I said that it would break our friendship and I shouldn't say it also because we've known each other for a week (but then again we also shared a lot of genuine things to each other). She replied ""I think I already know where this is going so might as well spill"",  So I thought about for a bit and confessed. All I was thinking about was her rejecting me so that I can be somewhat be prepared for the worse. I aplogized for wasting her time with this and said we should head back.

Then she stopped me and said ""So you think nothings gonna happen?"" I replied ""yeah, you probably dont feel this way too."" But she said that ""Since you told your part, now listen to mine."" So I sat down again, brain malfunctioning and she said she likes me, Since day 2 of meeting. we talked abt it some more eventually agreed that We can take our own pace since she's scared of the future since this is her first REAL connection with someone.

After some time we flirted more but also had the same silly interactions prior to confessing and really just enjoyed spending time together.

Although after that day, she doesnt text anymore, I tried to meet up with her 2 seperate times as well. The first time was going to a nearby coffee shop near her school since I've never been there but she said she was busy. Second time was I asked if I could visit her house since my house was out of power that day and she said ""as much as I want to say yes, given how I feel rn, Im gonna decline"". Both of these times I didnt pry and just accepted it as it is and hoped that shes doing well, but I keep seeing the IG stories of her mutuals and see her having time to go somewhere with them. I feel like were growing distant since she wont tell me what she feels anymore. Is there anything I can do? in this situation??

Gua bukan ahli brewer, penikmat kopi pro, ato pemilik usaha kopi ato apalah kayak u/GoldenNike itu so anggap saja POV gua berdasarkan dr seorang customer yang suka nongkrong cari makan/minuman enak, suasana ato cari wifi kenceng. Btw, gua itu teh susu enjoyer jd mohon maaf gua gbs kasih review mendalam soal kopi tempat mana yang enak. Ini bakal puanjang karena ada bbrp hal yang pengen gua keluarkan sekarang. Mohon maaf kalo ada kesalahan ato kurang jelas karena panjangnya tulisan ini. Tolong kasih tau gua hal apa aja yang kurang jelas nanti gua perbaiki.

**Masa Kecil dan Warkop**

Dari sekitar umur 6 tahun, gua sudah terbiasa nongkrong di warkop pas hari minggu. Tempat yang gua inget dr kecil udh gua kunjungi itu Warkop di Hijas yang ada foto2 petinggi PDIP itu(iirc ada bu mega dan pak jokowi disitu), Warkop Suka Hati yang terkenal dengan Pisang Srikaya nya (kata salah satu artis ibukota yang gua curi denger, dia bilang srikaya disini rasanya beda sama diluar), Warkop Winny yang didepan hotel Gajahmada, dan Warkop Asiang (Bapak Asiang biasanya nongol di pagi hari dengan bertelanjang dada sambil membuat pesanan minumannya. Gitu2 banyak pejabat dan orang penting suka ngopi kesitu, liat aja fotonya di lantai 1 dan lantai 2). Orang Pontianak pasti enggak asing sama warkop yang gua sebutkan tadi karena mrk sudah berdiri bahkan ada yang sampe sebelum ortu mrk lahir. For me, warkop di Pontianak sudah menjadi tempat comfy buat diajak ketemuan. Selain harganya yang lebih masuk akal dibandingkan tempat nongkrong lainnya, pilihan kue2 kecil untuk menemani ngopinya jg lebih beragam. Dan lagi, bapak2 yang biasa gua temui buat keperluan emang suka nya di warkop gitu, probably because lidah mrk lebih cocok sama kopi + kue2 kecil yang biasa disajikan disana.

**Jakarta dan Tempat Nongkrongnya**

Lalu ketika SMA hingga lulus kuliah, gua tinggalnya di Jakarta. Kalo boleh jujur, bahkan sampe sekarang gua kurang suka nongkrong gt di Jakarta. For starter, gua nyari warkop comfy yang kayak tempat2 yang gua sebutkan tadi di Jakarta. Rasanya gua ga nemu2 yang pas di hati ato engga ya overpriced banget ujung2nya (apaan tuh kopitiam, nanti gua perjelas lg lebih lanjut). Yang biasa jual ropisbak ato mie kornet di jalan2 itu sbnrnya enak2 aja, cmn gua nyari tempat yang bisa gua pake buat duduk lama entah buat kerja kek ato mikirin nasib gua gitu. Tipe2 warkop yang di ruko kecil2 itu? Kurang nyaman banget buat gua. Ujung2nya, gua jd lebih sering ke cafe or coffeshop mcm UpNormal gitu. As much as how comfy those coffe shop are, it somehow lack the cozy comfort that I usually only get when I nongkrong di Warkop di Pontianak. 

**Might Be Unpopular Opinion About Milk Tea and Kue2 Kecil**

My biggest pet peeves about tempat nongkrong di Jakarta adalah not only pilihan kue2 kecilnya sangat terbatas ato malah enggak ada (maksud gua kayak lemper, roti isi abon ato srikaya, gorengan, tar susu, dsb), tapi juga gaada satupun tempat yang bisa nyajiin teh susu seenak di Pontianak. Pasti buat kalian teh susu itu cmn teh celup yang dikasih susu dan rasanya bisa sama mau diapain juga. Tapi buat gua cara penyajian itu ngaruh banget sama rasa teh susu itu. Gua selalu bete pas liat teh susu yang gua pesen itu ya keliatan banget dibikin asal2an dengan cmn kasih susu kental manis sama teh celup (biasanya yang asal2an itu ngasih ke gua bahkan blm diaduk sama sekali). Padahal kalo biasanya gua ke bbrp warkop di Pontianak, rasanya tuh bisa enak dan beda dr teh susu yang gua bilang asal2an itu. Malah di Asiang gua bisa upsize gelas, milih tingkat kekentalan, sama kemanisan. I feel like people doesnt treat teh susu seriously because again, they thought making teh susu is easy and it really disappoint me.

**Perubahan Yang Gua Rasakan Ketika Kembali Ke Pontianak Lagi**

Abis kuliah, gua mutusin stay di Pontianak sampe skrg. Warung Kopi Aming (ini warkop umurnya lama jg btw) yang gua akui br denger pas umur SMA or smt sudah buka cabang dimana2 di Kalbar. Bahkan kalo gslh Aming sudah buka di Jakarta. Asiang otw buka cabang ketiga di Kubu Raya. Trs gua perhatikan ada gimmick baru yang namanya ""kopitiam"". Pertama2 gua liat itu, mikirnya itu ada pembedanya entah apalah. Cuman pas gua coba di salah satu tempat dengan embel2 kopitiam, gua malah mikir ""anying ini mah kayak warkop langganan gua cmn lebih mahal dan isi makanan beratnya lebih macem2 aja"". After that, gua masih reluctant ampe skrg buat ngunjungin tempat yang ada tulisan kopitiamnya karena menurut gua itu cmn jual gimmick doang.

Ngomong2 soal gimmick, di Pontianak sptnya lagi demam coffeshop dimana2 dan belum keliatan bakal mereda dalam waktu dekat. Gua gbs pin point titik awalnya ini terjadi dr mana. Tapi sptnya ini berawal dari UpNormal yang pernah buka di Pontianak (Udh tutup, fix gakuat bersaing. Pontianak kalo tempat makanan/minuman emang sengit persaingannya, ga heran yang versi bootleg yang ujung2nya bertahan) ato Aming, CW, dan Lokale yang gencar expansion (CW sama Lokale asli dr Pontianak), tapi yang jelas berbagai macam coffeshop dan warkop makin membludak di Pontianak. Terus sekarang tambah lg ada billiard nya nempel. Tidak lupa juga tempat nongkrong yang pake gimmick kopitiam itu makin banyak di Pontianak. Coffeshop dan cafe yang jualan dimsum jg makin bertambah.

**Apa Gua Harus Senang Soal Keadaan Tempat Nongkrong di Pontianak?**

Terus terang, melihat situasi sekarang di Pontianak, gua gatau apakah harus ngerasa senang atau tidak. Di satu sisi, memang baik karena menunjukkan brand lokal makin banyak tumbuh di Pontianak bahkan sampe2 bisa geser brand yang bukan asli Pontianak. Tapi, gua notice bbrp hal yang gua kurang suka. Misalnya, rasa minuman di tiap coffeshop yang rasanya makin lama makin berasa ""sama"". Ato enggak hidangan2 yang pilihannya itu2 aja. Cake ato roti2 jg lama2 gua perhatiin supplier nya sama semua (kecuali yang coffeshop nya double jualan roti juga). Rasa minuman gausah ditanya dah, rasanya mirip2 mulu (I cant drink coffee too much due to my weak ass lambung). Ada tempat segelintir yang rasanya nawarin sesuatu yang berbeda (contoh untuk cafe contohnya Cafe No 3 dan Botani kalo comes to my mind, Cafe No 3 minumannya aja bisa bikin gua kenyang) but its few and far between.

**Sudah Usaha Mencari, Banyakan Zonk nya**

Setelah banyak keliling2 tempat nongkrong di Pontianak dari harga mid (Rp 25k - Rp 50k makan besar/kecil + minum), mid high (Rp 51k - Rp 75k makan besar/kecil + minum), to high (Rp 76k++ makan besar/kecil + minum), gua sampe ke kesimpulan kalo tempat nongkrong di Pontianak sekarang (bahkan warkop sekalipun) lebih fokus buat jualan suasana daripada rasa makanan dan minumannya. Jadinya yasudah, gua treat mrk seperti itu. Tapi ngerasa bosen jg lama2 kalo tiap tempat yang gua datangi, entah mid ato high, ngasih rasa yang mirip2 aja satu sama lain. Kurang terasa pembeda apa gitu yang bikin mrk unik dan gak jarang banyak bisnis (terutama cafe dan coffeshop) gua perhatikan bertumbangan karena gbs mempertahankan customer mereka. 

Pembeda itu seperti apa sih? Contoh, Sukahati yang gua sebutkan diatas. Kenapa masih awet sampe skrg? Karena bahkan dari jaman bokap gua msh diawang2 rasa pisang srikayanya msh konsisten dan emang enak ampe sekarang. Sangkin konsistennya, pisang/roti srikaya di Sukahati udh kayak salah satu kuliner lokal yang orang harus dicoba turis. Nah, tempat nongkrong jaman skrg kalo ada menu pisang srikaya aja buat nya suka asal2an, padahal itu menu andalan di Pontianak karena gua sendiri ga pernah encounter pisang srikaya diluar Pontianak (kecuali Aming di Jakarta kali, itupun setau gua rasanya beda). Something as small as ""pisangnya keras"" really ruins my dining experience.

Ujung2nya, karena berbagai faktor (terutama makanan dan minuman yang rasanya gitu2 aja tapi harga ga sesuai), gua balik ketempat langganan gua biasa. Itu pun gua jg ngerasa bosen lama2 karena ya gua pengen nyobain yang lain tp sejauh ini banyakan zonk nya. Gua ngerasa rugi waktu dan uang sih kalo zonk gitu, rasanya mending gua beli pecel lele gereja sekalian.

**Persatuan atau Asosiasi untuk Menampung Aspirasi Para Pemilik Tempat Nongkrong**

Sbnrnya gua nulis panjang2 gini tuh gara2 keinget kata2 u/GoldenNike yang kalo gsalah bilang kalo CoffeShop jaman sekarang tuh mainnya pada sendiri2 tanpa standar yang jelas. Warkop di Pontianak setau gua ada tuh persatuannya, cmn ya palingan ngurusin hal2 kayak ""masa kami gaboleh buka 24 jam?"". Gua sendiri belum pernah dengar persatuan yang naungin warkop di Pontianak punya semacam standar guideline mereka harus ngapain aja. 

**Mengutamakan Kebutuhan Daripada Kata Hati**

Harus gua akui, makin nambah umur, akhir2 ini gua malah nongki nya (kalo sendiri ato ada sesuatu yang ingin gua lakukan) ya ke coffeshop, cafe, ato warkop yang ada makanan, wifi, dan bukanya bisa lewat dr jam 12. Padahal kalo lu pada tanya gua, gua lebih suka di warkop2 old school kayak Suka Hati dan Asiang (di pusat mrk ya, bukan yang di cabang). Sayangnya, justru warkop pusat mrk antara buka nya ga sampe malam ato engga ya tidak ada wifi or ac (puanas cok Pontianak skrg, mana debu + abu dmn2 lg jd tempat nongki terbuka out of question) yang gua sangat butuhkan akhir2 ini. Terpaksa lah gua mengedepankan kebutuhan daripada kaya hati. 

**Penutup**

Lalu terakhir, untuk tempat nongkrong di Pontianak, ayolah lebih kreatif. Supplier cake, rasa dan racikan makanan/minuman, pilihan menu dan bentuk tempat, hampir semuanya terasa seragam, apa kalian yakin bisa beneran bertahan lama? Banyak itu di ayani dekat untan warkop2 dan tempat nongkrong lainnya yang gulung tikar meskipun disono merupakan tempat yang banyak dilewati kalangan anak muda ato orang yang suka nongkrong. 

Diatas panjang lebar merupakan pendapar gua, kalian gmn?

Gua pengen masuk ke babak restoran tema Jepang yang juga lg menjamur di Pontianak to gua ngerasa kurang riset yang ini (aka blm icip2 lebih lanjut) so yeah maybe next time(?).

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about.",5,1730287660.0,holofractal,1,1.0,False

I have a Rancilio Silvia with a Eureka Mignon grinder. Advice here seems to say that the Silvia comes with a 14g basket, although their product SKU listing states it is 16g. I put 16g in there regularly and do ok, in that shots are generally pulling in my targets and they taste good (to me).

The issue is, with some beans (and some beans that were ok until they're a bit older) I seem to be consistently unable to hit a fine enough grind to pull shots at my desired 16g:32g in 25-30s. In these instances if I up the dose to 17g or even 18g I'm back on track to hit a 1:2 in 25-30s, and sometimes it could even take longer. I know there is an issue with my grinder that I can remedy with some shims but I tried and it made it worse, so I undid it and am living with my above solution, which makes me happy enough.

My question is, is this solution working only because I've added more coffee for the water to push through? Or is overpacking the basket creating a tighter puck that slows the water down? I'm wondering if this solution would work with 16g in an 18g basket, or 18g in a 22g basket and perhaps an explanation as to why?

It's worth noting that on some beans my machine is grinding fine enough that my shots pour way too slowly, so I know this is likely more of an issue with the beans I tend to gravitate towards but I'm not really willing to budge there.",2,1730287266.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

So I don't really pay much attention to streaks but I've been on this journey for awhile. The longest has been a few months after which I felt a pop in my spine one night with energy rushing through my body for a few hours ....amazing experience . That was two years ago and since then I've been delving into breathwork , meditation and energy work. Ive yet to replicate the experience or anything similar and since then life seems to have gone backwards. It really started to feel like groundhog day despite my best efforts to manifest a positive change for myself. I got so frustrated a few months back that I started releasing again every few days. This made me feel unmotivated , lazy and even more depressed than I already was.

I got back on the wagon a few weeks back and it's been a battle to not release. These past few days have been a real struggle. I met up with a girl for the second time who I think is a lovely person and also very attractive. We also have a great laugh together and hours seem to slip away when we are chatting . I know deep down she's not the one so I wasn't going to initiate any kind of intimacy between us . When I tried to leave she started begging me to stay with her . She stripped down to practically nothing and the sight of her like that would get any man's pulse soaring. I won't go into the details but no sexual activity took place despite her best efforts . I drove away from the place absolutely horned up to the eyeballs with just releasing  on my mind as soon as I got back to mine. 

Before I got back back to mine, I received a phone call that a family member had been admitted to hospital with injuries sustained in a car crash . I was like what the f@ck is going on ...what is the universe doing to me ? I've been trying to manifest abundance for this family member for a few months . She does nothing but help people yet does so on a very tight budget . She needs to change her car and I've been visualising this because I wanted something safer for her because she's in the road so much. I was filled with anger and rage wondering how the hell could this be happening . I only want the best for everyone including myself and yet the universe throws up this sh&t.

A few days have past now and thankfully she's on the mend but has alot of recovering to do . I'm beyond tired trying to juggle work and spending time in the hospital. I woke up early this morning ,had some coffee but was so fatigued I went back to bed . 

I dreamt I was in my home place where I grew up . The house was empty except for this hot looking lady maybe in her forties prancing around the house in what looked like a silky night gown . She had dark hair , beautiful looking with an amazing figure . Anyway things started to get frisky between us and before any real action took place , she started whispering something in my ear over and over. I struggled to hear it at first but I then heard her say  ""release that kundalini energy ..give it me "" . I looked at her and her face had become distorted and wretched and she disappeared only to shapeshift into some kind of stinging insect . She was stinging me and i felt real pain . I was trying to fight her off but she shifting and hiding, laughing creepily and it was like a scene from a Japanese horror movie. I was really scared and woke up with a jolt .

I got up and drove to the local beach and it was a beautiful day and the ocean looked amazing . I was lying down in a little sand bunker and the place was very busy . People seemed to be more friendly than normal and I was chatting with a lot of people as they went by . Two girls came over to me and started talking to me . They whispered in each others ear and one girl left . The other girl who was a really good looking blonde girl started overly friendly and started touching me . She was teasing , pulling up her top and I was like wtf is going on here . The tide was coming in fast around us and she said she was going for a swim . When she was going into the water she was talking to other guys and I got the feeling that they all knew her ( intimately ). I decided to bail out and go back to the car but as I got up , I saw that the ocean had surrounded me cutting me off from getting back on shore . I freaked out and that's when I woke  up again . 

It was a dream within a dream but both were so vivid it seemed like reality especially the second one. I was freaked out for a few minutes still unsure if I was awake or not . Just wondering has anyone had anything similar happen ? ",5,1730286729.0,Semenretention,2,1.0,False

1gfjxhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/makerecipes/comments/1gfjxhr/discovering_dirty_soda/,Discovering Dirty Soda,"Dirty soda is the ultimate blend of creamy and fizzy, making it the perfect drink for warm weather. Think of it as a customizable, non-alcoholic cocktail that you can tailor to your taste.

If you haven't heard of dirty soda yet, you might be missing out on a delightful trend that’s taken off, especially thanks to social media influencers and celebrities like Olivia Rodrigo. For those unfamiliar, particularly outside of Utah, let’s dive into what makes this drink so special.

# What Exactly Is Dirty Soda?

At its core, dirty soda combines fountain soda with flavored syrups and cream, served over crunchy nugget ice. The combinations are endless, allowing you to create a drink that suits your unique flavor preferences. The classic version features Diet Coke over ice, blended with coconut syrup, fresh lime juice, and a splash of half-and-half. The result? A creamy, refreshing drink that feels indulgent yet light.

# The Origin of Dirty Soda

This drink hails from Utah, where the large Mormon community sought creative ways to enjoy mixed drinks without alcohol or coffee. This innovative approach gave rise to dirty soda, a fun and festive alternative that has captured the hearts (and taste buds) of many...

How do you know if it’s appropriate to be more honest about things?,"I’ve previously posted about this topic, several times I’d say. I’m in college, a time when I’m meeting lots of people, making acquaintances etc. 

I was thinking about the process of friendly acquaintances becoming close friends. With close friends you can be honest and open about your private life, whereas with an acquaintance it’s not really seen as appropriate to be that open.

But in order to transition to close friends, you have to be more vulnerable with each other. And I’ve concluded that this only works if both people either want to become closer, or are open to becoming closer. 

For example, supposing you have plans with an acquaintance that you’re interested in becoming closer with to get coffee. However you spent the morning crying due to mental health issues, and can’t face going out. Should you be vague eg. “I don’t feel well” or should you be a bit more honest eg. “I’m going through quite a hard time mentally at the moment”. I feel like being vague just keeps you at “acquaintance” level. But being more honest could risk coming across as “trauma dumping” and making them uncomfortable. 

So my question is - how can you tell if an acquaintance wants to become closer, or is open to becoming closer? How do you know when it’s appropriate to be more honest about personal things?

1gfjtx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrcreeps/comments/1gfjtx2/i_spent_an_afternoon_babysitting_the_four/,I spent an afternoon babysitting the four horsemen of the apocalypse,"I had been thinking about picking up a part-time job for a while now. The semester was over and I got a bunch of free time on my hands. Might as well make a bit of cash in the meantime. And so my search on Linkedin began. I was looking for something simple and stress-free. Preferably something I could do with minimal effort whilst staring at my phone to pass the time. I spent hours browsing through the sea of options. The majority of what I found were graphic design commissions, tutoring, and waiting tables, which I either lacked the skills for or just found unappealing. Just when I was about to give up, I stumbled onto a post, requesting for a babysitter. The post was vague, only including an address and a phone number. Typically, I would have just scrolled past this post and not given it a second thought. But I immediately noticed that the address was conveniently close to where I live. I decided to at least find out more. The call was answered before the first ring could finish.

“For the last time, I don’t want to answer your stupid surveys!”

I could hear in the background a chaotic symphony of the TV, the sound of a vacuum, and a child crying. 

“Um…I’m calling about the babysitting job?”

I feared for what I might be getting myself into. I had no prior experience taking care of children and it sounded like I was throwing myself into the deep end of the pool with this one.

“Oh? OH! Yes, the babysitting job. Yes, thank god. It’s been a nightmare trying to find one. Look. I’m running late and I’ve got about a hundred errands I need to get to. If you can get here in half an hour and look after my kids for three to four hours, five max, I’ll pay you whatever you want.”

A part of me felt bad for how desperate this man sounded. The other part of me was worried about the shitstorm I might have to weather for the next five hours. The other other part of me kept replaying the words “I’ll pay you whatever you want” in my head. 

“I’ll see you in twenty minutes.”

Fifteen minutes later I found myself in front of apartment 4H. The entire complex seemed old. Likely built in the '80s. Yet the red wallpaper, mahogany accents, and soft carpeting gave it the feel of a luxurious hotel. I could hear the same chaotic storm I had previously heard on the phone brewing inside. I felt hesitant but I already came all this way. I raised my hand up to knock, only for the door to fly open as I did.

“Oh. Hello. You're the babysitter, right?”

The man didn’t look like how I pictured him at all. He wore a clean navy-colored suit and had a tall, muscular build. He was mostly well put together besides his deep sunken eye bags, messy curly hair, and unevenly shaved stubble. Despite it all, he was actually quite handsome.

“Yep. That's me,” I confirmed.

“You’re a fast one. Caught me by surprise,” he chuckled. “Please, come in.”

I walked into the small apartment and followed him into the living room. There, I witnessed two small boys, who both looked to be about seven or eight, fighting over a small green figure of a toy soldier. The entire living room was littered with hundreds of these soldiers and tanks scattered haphazardly across the carpeted floor. I almost didn’t notice the little girl in a black dress on the couch. She sat motionless staring at the TV. MasterChef was playing. Junior.

“Hey guys. Settle down please,” the man ordered sternly.

The three children stopped their antics and simultaneously jerked their heads around to stare at me.

“Daddy is gonna be gone for a little while, alright? This nice lady here is…”

“Emily.”

“Emily is gonna look after you guys. While I'm gone she’s in charge. So be on your best behavior. I don’t want a repeat of last time.”

The children collectively gave a silent enthusiastic nod.

“Good.”

The man then turned to me.

“Emily, meet con…” the man caught himself mid-sentence.

“Silly me. I meant to say, meet Zelos, the one in the white shirt, and Martius, the one in red. They’re twins. And Limos, the girl.”

Strange names I thought. The three children waved their little hands at me as their names were called. I awkwardly waved back.

“Perfect. Bathroom is the door on the left,” he said as he gestured towards the connecting hallway with four doors. One on the left, two on the right, and one at the end of the hall. “And you can help yourself to anything in the fridge. Make yourself at home. Just…don’t go into the room at the end of the hall. That’s off limits.”

“Yeah, no problem,” I assured him.

“You might hear something inside and—""

A buzzing noise interrupted him as he frantically fished around his pocket, pulling out a phone.

“Shi-oot. I really need to get going.”

He took his wallet out and without taking his eyes off of his phone, handed me a thick wad of cash.

“Here. Order some takeout with this if they get peckish.”

Before I could think of asking questions the man disappeared out the door. I could respect an exhausted single father trying to make it through the day but he seemed awfully irresponsible leaving me, a stranger, with his kids.

I turned back to see the three children, staring at me with blank expressions.

“Looks like I’m outnumbered, guys,” I joked, trying to break the ice.

They remained silent. The girl, Limos, lost quickly interest and turned her attention back to the TV. The boys craned their necks upwards, studying me. Somehow, I felt as if they were looking down on me.

“So… how’s the battle going fellas?” I asked, attempting again to rid the awkward tension.

“Would you like to play?” Martius asked.

“NO!” Zelos began to protest.

“Father said she was in charge.”

Zelos glared at Martius, furious for even suggesting the idea that someone join their campaign. I thought it best that I remained neutral. After all, I was trying to take the next few hours as easy as possible.

“No it's alright. Thanks though. You guys carry on.”

I stood straight, furrowed my brows, and gave them a salute, doing my best impression of a soldier.

“Very well,” said Martius, as he saluted back.

I joined Limos on the couch, who upon a closer look, appeared thin and skinny. It was to the point where I was genuinely concerned that she had some kind of illness. Perhaps anorexia.

The small girl piped up with a soft quiet voice. “Can we eat? I’m hungry.”

“Of course we can sweetheart,” I told her, trying my best to show how concerned I was for her. Pizza ought to do some good.

We waited for the delivery to arrive. During that time the boys played on their battlefield and Limos lazed on the couch next to me. Her only presence being that of sharp breaths.

I found it rather cute that the boys weren’t smashing the tanks together and throwing toy soldiers at each other like I expected children their age would do. They looked as if they were competent generals of the great apartment war, and had to send their loyal men to die on no-man’s carpet. They paced around the battlefield, stroking their chin, careful not to step on any of the small soldiers.

I looked over at the little girl sitting next to me. She stared wide-eyed at the TV, mesmerized by the food.

Although pizza would be arriving soon, I thought I might as well rummage around in the fridge and cupboard for some snacks. I got up from the couch which alerted Zelos.

“Where do you think you're going?” he questioned.

“Just gonna see if you guys have any snacks.”

“They’re not for you, stranger. You think you can just come here and take what you want?”

I’ll be the first to admit that I didn’t conduct myself with the maturity of my age. But something about this disrespectful little brat got on my nerves.

“I recall your dad saying I was in charge and to ‘help myself’ to whatever I please,” I mocked, putting on a posh accent, mimicking that of royalty.

“Bitch.”

I was appalled to hear such a young boy be so vulgar and rude. I wanted to discipline him. I wanted to let him know that he was to respect me. That he should listen to what I say and learn to quickly apologize. In hindsight, this didn’t feel like me at all. I came here to make a quick buck. Why did I care so much about enduring insults from children? At that moment, I very much did care.

I straightened my posture to look as imposing as possible and stomped my foot down as hard as I could, just to try and make him flinch. As I did, I felt a sharp sting of pain shoot up my leg. I fell back onto the couch and lifted my foot onto my knees to inspect what had caused the pain. It was a toy soldier’s bayonet. The soldier’s arm was half torn off, only attached to the torso by a thin strip of green plastic. I slowly pulled the sharp plastic piece out of my foot, leaving a small stain of blood on my socks.

“Shit,” I blurted aloud.

I looked up to see Zelos and Martius staring at me. Zelos, as expected, looked livid that I had broken his toy. Martius on the other hand, looked at the broken soldier that now laid on the carpet. The tip of its bayonet now covered in a dark tint of red. He had a mournful look on his face.

“Guys…I’m so sorry,” I apologized, the anger I had felt quickly fading away. “I’ll buy you a new one I promise.”

“THAT WASN’T HOW IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO!” Zelos exploded.

“Zelos please. I’ll replace it for you the next time I come over, okay?”

“He can’t be replaced,” said Martius, as he got on his knees and gingerly picked up the soldier.

He brought it to a small jar that rested on the coffee table. The jar was half filled with green plastic soldier parts. A loose collection of hands, feets, heads, and torsos. Martius carefully sets the soldier he held onto the top of the pile.

“You guys really shouldn’t just leave these toys on the floor like this.”

Martius shot a furious glare at me in response to that comment.

“I DON’T CARE IF YOU’RE IN CHARGE! IT’S NOT FAIR!”

Then I did something I regretted. I giggled. I found it amusing how they were so immersed in this game of theirs. I tried to stop myself, especially when I saw how the twins were fuming.

“I’m…I’m really sorry guys. I’ll make it up to you I promise.”

“You don’t understand. This is not a mistake easily amendable. But perhaps…” Martius stopped, turning to Zelos.

The two of them seemed to have a silent conversation between themselves. Zelos, with tears welling up in his eyes, gave Martius a solemn nod.

Zelos, reaching into his pockets, took out another toy soldier. He handed it to Martius, who in turn, presented it to me. This one was different. It was a bit shorter and had a smaller build. It was a woman, in the same soldier uniform and equipped with identical gear as the rest. This was my first close look at these toys and I was impressed with how detailed they were. Down to the intricate facial features.

I was puzzled by the realization. I was sure I was just overthinking it but the small green face that stared back at me, was mine.

Before I could examine it further, Martius quickly snatched the toy from my grasp. He marched back to the center of the carpet battlefield, with my soldier in hand.

“Perhaps we can make you understand,” said Martius, as he places the soldier down on the carpet.

“Wait. Give that…” I started to say.

I never got to finish my sentence. I still don’t know which of the assaults on my senses alerted me first. Was it the awful smell of sulfuric odor, the metallic scent of blood, and the acrid tang of gunpowder? Was it the thick gritty taste of ash and smoke that lingered in the air? Was it the chorus of unintelligible screams, and the staccato of machine-gun fire that flew overhead? Regardless, what caught my attention the most, was the soldier in front me. He sat slumped into the mud and filth of the trench we were in. I knew he was dead by just the look on his face. His eyes, barely open, lazily staring at me. His jaws hung slack with a river of blood trickling from the edge of his lips. As for the rest of his body, it had been contorted to a mangled mass of flesh. His arms, attached to the torso by only a strip of sinew. His hands still held on tightly to his weapon. A rifle with a fixed bayonet.

Just a moment ago I had been sitting on a couch in a living room in a small apartment downtown. I blinked and everything changed so abruptly, I couldn’t even begin to comprehend what had happened to me.

The mud I sat on was softened by either rainwater or blood. It was cold and the moisture seeped into the uniform I now wore. Somehow sinking deeper into the ground gave me the slightest notion of comfort. Perhaps no one would notice me, I thought. I could pass for another corpse amongst the hundreds. And so I stayed quiet, holding myself back from screaming or crying. I tried remaining still but I couldn’t stop my heart from furiously beating or my teeth from chattering. I plugged my ears with my filthy fingers, covered in dirt and soot, desperately attempting to shield myself from the horrible blood-curdling screeches that could barely be said to have come from a human. I breathed small gasps of ashy air to avoid having to smell the rot. I took one last look at the dead soldier before shutting my eyes. I would’ve kept them shut too if I didn’t catch a flicker of movement.

He blinked.

My eyes shot wide open, staring intently into the soldier’s soulless eyes. His eyelids began to flutter. His fingers twitched. His ankles shifted ever so slightly. Then without warning, his upper body heaved forward, lunging towards me. Its lower body didn’t follow and his spine immediately disconnected with a sickening crack. He landed at my feet, face-planting in the mud, and returned to being inanimate. I almost let out a yelp but it got caught in my dry throat. I thought that maybe some explosive shockwave had simply knocked him over.

Suddenly, his arm, attached only by a chipped bone and strips of exposed muscles flung upwards, grabbing me by my leg. I screamed but only a raspy gasp resonated as my vocal cords strained and burned. I kicked at the corpse but it refused to release its grasp. With surprising force and speed, it yanked itself towards me so that its torso landed on my knees. I felt the soft tissues of its dismembered half resting on me. Its body slumped onto mine and its face pressed right against my ears as I turned away, refusing to look at the monster. Surely I was in hell.

Then, softly, a whisper resonated deeply over the deafening sounds of the battle. The soldier croaked into my ears with a plea.

“I – I beg of you. Release…the pale rider.”

A bell rang in the distance. Like a wave, the sound washed over me and in an instant, everything fell away. The cries, the rot, the filth, and the corpse. All gone. The familiar sound of the TV and the fresh breathable air reassured me that I was back in the apartment, sitting on the floor, leaning against the couch. It was such a surreal and abrupt shift of scenery I could’ve almost convinced myself it had all been in my head. That was until I saw Martius stood where he had been previously, holding a small green soldier in his hand. He looked at me, no longer with the look of anger, but of pity. I flinched as he began making his way towards me, careful of where he stepped. He crouched down next to me, took my hand, and placed the figure onto my palm. I didn’t need to look to know that it was my figure he had given me.

“Take better care of this one,” he said to me as if I was a child in his eyes.

The familiar note of the bell that had pulled me back to the apartment rang once again. It took me a moment to gather my thoughts and realize that it was the doorbell I had been hearing. Someone was at the door.

“Pizza time!” Limos shouted excitedly.

Slowly, I pushed myself off the floor, found my balance, then began making my way towards the door. I’m sure many of you, in my shoes, would’ve taken this opportunity to escape. Likewise, I had made the decision that I was going to run fast and far the moment I opened the door, leaving this accursed apartment of demonic children. No amount of money could be worth what I had just experienced. I found myself in a small sprint as I neared the door. My hand shot out towards the handle and I forcefully yanked the door open, pulling myself into the hallway.

I was greeted by the fragrance of pizza and nothing. Utter darkness. The hallway I had entered from earlier, now void of any light besides the faint glow coming from the apartment. All that seemed to exist within the hallway was me and the box of pizza on the floor. Domino’s.

I stood there, contemplating on what to do. Perhaps the electricity had just simply gone out. That was fine, because I recalled where the stairwell was located. I could still escape.

“Are you going to share?”

Limos’s voice from behind startled me. I leapt away from her and the apartment, deeper into the hall. She was standing at the threshold of the apartment. Between the two of us, the pizza box sat patiently.

“Please,” she pleaded. “I’m so hungry.”

The look on her face read of desperation. The black dress she wore appeared to hang loosely on her body. I was sure it fitted her earlier but now it seemed a few sizes too big.

“Please,” she begged again. “The pale one is close.”

There it was again. The mention of this pale thing. Upon hearing this ominous omen, I turned around and blindly sprinted in the opposite direction down the hall where I remembered the stairs to be. It had to be there. My foot stamped and beat against the floor as I bolted in a straight line. In the pitch black, it was impossible to see how close I was. I fully expected to eventually run into a wall. No obstacle ever came.

“It’s not something you can outrun,” Limos spoke again, the volume of her voice noticeably hadn’t faltered with the distance I had traveled.

I stopped in my tracks. I turned to face her thinking she had followed me. She hadn’t. She still remained at the threshold of the apartment doorway. The pizza box still laid on the floor between us. And I stood where I had been at the start. A mere few feet out the apartment.

“It’s not the fastest, but it’ll catch you,” she spoke as I struggled to catch my breath. “It always does.”

“What is this?” I asked her, demanding the child for an answer.

I was at a loss. Everything certain that I built my understanding of the world on had crumbled away. What was left was anger and fear. Like a small mouse cornered and out of options.

“It’s pizza.”

“WHAT IS THIS PLACE!” I yelled back, finally losing my temper. I never thought myself capable of hurting a child but at that moment, I was prepared to do so.

“Domino.”

“ENOUGH!” I screamed as I lunged at her, attempting to do something horrible.

I reached out to grab her by the collar of her dress. She didn’t step backwards or attempt to dodge, yet somehow she shifted ever so slightly out of my reach. I fell flat on my face onto the cold solid floor, now noticing that I wasn’t even sure what I had been standing on. I felt pain, followed by blood trickling out of my nose. It most certainly wasn’t the soft carpeted floor I recalled when first arriving at this apartment complex.

As I laid prone on the floor, I stared up at the frail girl who now stood above me with an imposing presence. Behind her, the light of the apartment in stark contrast to the darkness made her figure a dark silhouette. I felt defeated. I didn’t even try to stand back up. I may not have been sure where I was but the ground felt solid and tangible. It was something I could be certain of and that brought me comfort.

“What is this?” I asked again, this time my question came out quivering.

Limos crouched down, inspecting me as if I was a small insect she found crawling across the floor.

“The path,” she answered.

“What does that mean?”

“Are you hungry?” she asked me, ignoring my question.

Her concern sounded genuine. I wanted to tell her I wasn’t since food was the least of my worries, but as soon as she asked, it was as if she reminded my body of the idea of hunger. I felt starved. I felt hunger like I had never felt before. My stomach curled and cramped within me, screaming for sustenance. The aroma of the pizza now overpowering all my senses. I could almost taste the fragrance in the air itself.

“Y-Yes.”

“Are you strong?” she asked again.

“Y-” I hesitated to answer. How could I be strong in the state I was in?

“Do you want to live?”

“Yes. Yes please. Please let me live,” I begged her. “Please help me.”

“I want to live too,” she said as she began stepping towards the pizza box.

She gently lifted the cardboard box open and the smell of the bubbling cheese, tomato sauce, and pepperoni had me salivating. I immediately mustered up my last bit of strength and brought myself to my hands and knees. I crawled in the direction of the beckoning food, yet quickly realized I was making no progress. As if I was on a hamster wheel, I simply could not move any closer. I started to crawl faster, with more desperation, and before long, I had gotten onto my feet. I stumbled toward the little girl, who was now hunched over the pizza box on the floor with her back facing me. My stumbling sped up until I jogged, then ran, then to a full-on sprint. No matter how fast or slow I went, I made no progress. They were right there in front of me. I was so close yet so infinitely far. All I could do was move in place, watching Limos scarf down each slice before me. As she gleefully ate, my only thought was the dwindling food left for me when I eventually reached the pizza box. She was going to eat it all for herself and leave me with nothing. I couldn’t let that happen. One after another, the slices of pizza disappeared down her gluttonous gullet. I remember begging her to help me. To toss me just a bit. To save some for me. She never bothered to turn around. I yelled and screamed but eventually, I grew too tired to do so.

Finally, it came down to the final slice. She reached for it like she did the others. As I felt the last bit of my strength drain, in desperation, I tried leaping towards her one last time. I fully assumed that I would just land on my face as I did before, no closer to salvation. Yet I held out hope. I think that was what did it. Desperate, violent hope. One last act of defiance against the inevitable death. This time, I felt myself propel forward and for the first time, Limos rapidly approached me. I slammed into the small frail child, landing on top of her with incredible force. She yelped in surprise and pain as I felt her brittle right arm snap under the weight of my knee. In that moment, not only did I dismiss the injury I caused her, I felt retribution as it was revenge for watching me suffer. I quickly turned my attention to the box of pizza which to my horror, was now empty.

Furious, I turned back to Limos, who I now see in her right hand, despite the pain of her fractured arm, still held onto the last slice. Without hesitation, I ripped it out of her hand and forcefully shoved it down my throat. I expected it to taste like the most savory, delicious bite and yet, as my taste buds familiarized itself with the gooey slop, I was met with the disgusting taste of rot. Involuntarily, I threw up what little was left in my stomach. Black viscous liquid poured out of my mouth along with the half-chewed pizza. It appeared molded and putrid, as if it had been neglected for months. Dark moldy spots of purple and green hue festered on the crust. Small specks of pale maggots writhed in the spoiled cheese and toppings. I spat onto the floor, attempting to wash the terrible taste that lingered.

“NO!” Limos shrieked in horror as I keeled over the pile of vomit in excruciating pain.

With my knee still holding her down by her broken arm, she began to struggle with a surprising spur of strength. I watched as she forcefully tugged on her fractured arm, steam exuding from her elbow. Gradually, her arm stretched and strained as she pulled. I was too weak and terrified to stop her. With a wail of pain and triumph, she slid the bone of her forearm out of her arm as if it were a sleeve made of muscle and skin. The motion was so smooth it was like pulling the bone out of a tenderized rib.

Upon freeing herself, she pushed me aside and with her one arm, scooped the black vile mass into her mouth. The sound of animalistic slurping and feral grunts was all I heard. No traces of humanity were left. As she devoured the filth with reckless abandon my attention turned to the steaming flesh that she left behind. I feared a part of me knew that I was not far from descending to her level of madness.

It reminded me of the burning smell of human flesh from the trenches. I reached out to it. Piping hot to the touch. I grabbed onto the wrist and with a revolting squish, the skin and muscle fiber fell apart like pulled pork.

Just then, a shadow casted over me. A figure loomed before me, covering the light of the apartment.

“Pathetic,” Zelos taunted with a disgusted look of pity on his face.

I could only imagine what he saw of me. Then he slammed the door shut leaving me shrouded in true darkness.

I wasn’t sure how long I was there for. The awful sound of Limos’s savagery quickly died down as she finished what was left of my excretion. After that, it was hard to tell how much time had passed. I stayed grovelling on the ground, my hand still held on the warm moist lump of the girl’s discarded flesh. My hunger grew ever stronger but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. To stoop so low. To even think of consuming my own. It was abominable. I thought it better to be starved to death. To finally be free of this nightmare. I don’t expect anyone to understand or condone my actions, but know that I was pushed to the brink of my sanity. A deep primal urge within me wanted so desperately to live. To survive at any cost. So reluctantly, I held the mass of flesh and slowly brought it to my mouth, thankful that at the very least I could not see what I had to do. As I choked on the gamey meat through sobs, I heard a shuffling sound approach me. I couldn’t see her but I knew Limos was standing right next to me while I chewed on her member.

“You are strong,” she whispered.

Within the void, a blinding light washed over us. I squinted my eyes and in an instant, just as seamless as it had been in the trench, I found myself back in the apartment. Except this time it was quiet and empty. The TV had been turned off and the floor was cleared of the toys. The insatiable hunger I had felt mere moments ago faded away. The only thing left of the horrors in the abyss was the vile aftertaste that continued to linger. It quickly came to my realization that I appeared to be alone in the apartment. I got up and did a quick scan of the living room and the kitchen to confirm it. I was alone. Perhaps they had retreated back into their rooms. I looked down the hall to the bedrooms, which now appeared more threatening and ominous. As if some new terror lurks behind each door.

Once again, I found myself with an opportunity to escape. This time however, I feared using the front door and ending up back in that terrible purgatory. The next method of exit would be out the window. I could still hear the sound of bustling pedestrians and traffic outside. It calmed me knowing that I was still somewhat connected with the outside world. I was four stories up with no safe way of getting down, but at that point I was content with simply risking the fall. To my disappointment, the window refused to budge when I tried lifting it open. It was an old wooden framed window with no locks on it. Through some supernatural means, it was simply immovable. On the verge of a breakdown, I grabbed the nearest solid object to me which was a desk lamp and proceeded to smash it into the glass as hard as I could. I couldn’t even leave a scratch. Feeling at a loss, I reluctantly tried the door once again. Slowly and carefully, I opened the door, making sure that I kept myself within the confines of the apartment.

To my relief, I was no longer greeted by the abyss. The hallway had returned to its original state. Hesitantly, I stepped out into the hallway. As I crossed the threshold out the apartment, a faint cry emanated from behind me. It was the sound of an infant bawling. I flinched as the crying broke the eerie silence. It's odd that the sound of a helpless baby crying could invoke such fear within me but nevertheless I sprinted out of the apartment and ran for the stairwell. My heart pumped furiously as I sprinted as fast as I could away from the danger, taking two or three steps at a time. As I reached the ground level, I bursted out the stairwell door into the lobby. I found myself standing at the threshold of apartment 4H. The baby’s crying now intensified. I turned back expecting the stairwell I had just exited to still be behind me. The same hallway on the fourth floor greeted me. After being led on with the hopes of escape only to be denied it once again, I fell onto my knees and wept. For the next few hours I cried along with the infant.

In the lasting moments I stayed idle, the sunlight from the window never seemed to dim. The father, the man who lured me into this abstract non-euclidian prison, has yet to return, and I doubted he ever will. Eventually, my crying ceased as my eyes ran dry. The infant however, continued its tantrum alone. Its lungs never tired or faltered. Hours, perhaps even days go by. In the time I’ve attempted multiple times to escape. My phone had no signal or connection and any attempt to reach the outside world failed. I tried the stairwell again only to find myself back in the apartment every time. I went knocking on the neighboring apartment doors only to be met with silence. When I tried forcing my way in, to my surprise, none of the doors were locked. Only it seemed every apartment was apartment 4H. The elevator, no matter what floor I chose, always opened to apartment 4H.

I never grew hungry or thirsty. I never tired or slept. I just existed in this static space where the sun never waned, the scenery unchanged, and the crying endless. I felt the essence of my soul dim. I had fought with all I had and committed heinous atrocities for the right to live. Now as I sat on the kitchen floor, feeling the sharp cool edge of a kitchen knife brush gently against my neck, I wondered why I had fought so hard. It’s okay to give up now, right? I’ve tried everything. I’m at the end of the road. With my eyes shut, my grip on the blade’s handle tightened as I slowly pressed the sharp edge firmly against my throat. I applied pressure slowly, still fearing the last stretch of pain before I could finally rest.

“I’m scared,” a child’s voice piped up.

I froze, unable to even breathe. I hesitated to open my eyes. I could hear the child sniffling and whimpering in front of me. I had gotten so used to it, the sudden absence of the baby’s cries unnerved me.

“Can you stay with me?” they asked, in a high-pitched shrill voice. It was the voice of a little girl but it didn’t sound like Limos.

I still held the blade closely to my neck with my eyes shut tightly. It felt reassuring that I could end the torment anytime I wanted to. To finally hold my own life in my hand. It gave me a sense of courage. My eyelids loosened and my vision fluttered open. Expecting to see a small child, instead towering over me was an old woman. She was impossibly tall, to the point she had to hunch over to avoid the ceiling. She stood naked, covered only by her long unkempt gray hair. Her ashened skin, although saggy and wrinkled, were clean and eerily pale. It was like the first hint of snowfall on a solstice, where soft curved patches of snow layered atop another. I didn’t notice a hint of blemish or imperfection. Her face however was that of a child. Up to her neck her skin becomes smooth like porcelain. Youth was distilled on only her facial features. Buttoned nose, wide eyes, small pink lips, and rounded cheeks. She looked at me with tears welling up in her puppy eyes.

“Can you read to me?” she asked, in the same childish voice. It was uncanny to see the thing speak.

I remained silent, unsure of how to respond. She raised her bony hand and reached her thin fingers towards me.

“Don’t,” I hissed, turning the knife onto her.

She quickly retracted her hand and backed away, retreating to the far end of the kitchen. For a moment I felt relieved to see this creature feared me as much I feared it. The moment was short-lived as her brow tightened, her cheeks flushed and her mouth tensed. She looked like she was about to burst.

“Why? Why do you still resist? Why can’t you just stay with me? It won’t hurt. It won’t ever hurt again.”

“What are you?” I demanded.

She looked at me curiously. Her face softened, as if comprehending my question.

“I’m the last one,” she answered. “I’m what's left when everyone is gone.”

Her expression shifted back to sadness, and I watched as a single streak of tear ran down her cheek.

“It’s lonely,” she sniveled.

“I can’t stay.”

Through her watery eyes, she cracked a warm smile.

“You will. You always do.”

The way she said it didn’t sound like a threat.

“Is there a way to leave?” I asked, my eyes darting towards the open door to the hallway.

Her eyes followed mine out the door, then she looked back at me, shaking her head.

“What can I do then?”

“You can rest,” she said. “Finally.”

The sweetness in her tone made the idea sound rather comfortable.

“Or…” she hesitated. “Or you can put me to rest.”

“What happens if I do that?” I questioned, intrigued by an alternative choice.

“Then I’ll see you again, down the road.”

“So I can leave?”

“For now. You’ll be back soon enough.”

She reached towards me, handing me a card I hadn’t previously noticed. Cautiously, I held it by the corner and took it. It was a polaroid. The image is blurry and yellowed by time. The photograph depicted an extreme wide shot of a beautiful meadow. In the distance, four horses frolicked in the tall grass.

I looked back at her, wondering what she was trying to tell me. With a grin on her face she excitedly twirls her finger around, signaling for me to turn the photo. I flipped it over and saw that written on the back in beautiful cursive handwriting, was a poem.

“Read to me,” she said, as she made her way onto the couch in the living room.

She sat down, curling herself into the corner. She patted the cushion next to her, beckoning for me to join. I set the knife down on the kitchen counter and complied.

With a gentle tone, as if singing a lullaby, I began to read the poem aloud.

“Dawn heralded the coming of their steeds,

Each rider, a calamity of man’s sinful deeds.”

I glanced at her, to see her nodding in approval.

“Keep going.”

I continued onto the next line.

“First came conquest, who bolstered the pride of man,

The white messenger's taunt is where it all began.

Then war swiftly followed, with fiery hate in his heart,

The red knight's blade spilled blood, torn flesh apart.

Next crept famine, that consumed the very last bite,

The black witch's spell shrouded the world with blight.”

My voice cracks, as I was reminded of the corpse and the abyss. My mouth felt dry and a chill ran down my spine. I pressed on.

“Finally arrived death, as they all wept and grieved,

The pale lady's touch gently granted them reprieve.”

My speech faltered as the realization dawned on me.

“The pale rider,” I muttered under my breath. I turned to see her eyes closed and her expression softened. She breathed steadily, her chest heaving with each inhale.

Even though she was asleep, I proceeded to read the final line of the poem to myself.

“One after another the domino falls,

Until dusk whisks the horsemen back to their stalls.”

As I finished, I felt a tear fall across my face. A tremendous wave of relief washed over me. As if a heavy burden had finally been lifted. Like for the first time in my life, I could truly breathe.

“Thank you,” I told her as she slept. “But not today. I can endure it for a bit longer.”

Then I watch the folds and sags of her skin tighten. Her body shrunk before me. Her hair retracted back into their follicles. Until laying beside me, was an infant. I carefully picked her up and carried her down the hall to the final room at the end. As I did, I walked past the three other rooms, the doors to which now hung open. In the first door on the right, I saw Zelos and Martius, sleeping in a bunk bed. I peeked inside, shut the lights off and closed the door as quietly as I could.

I continued down the hall and in the second door on the right, I saw Limos shivering in a fetal position on her bed. I walked over and pulled a blanket over her. Instantly her body relaxed and her breathing calmed. Again, I turned the lights off and closed the door behind me.

Onto the final room at the end of hall. Carefully balancing the infant in one arm, I turned the doorknob and stepped through. This room was by far the largest and most empty. Only three things took up any space. A crib in the center of the room, a small cot tucked away in the corner, and a wooden rocking horse painted white.

On the horse, carved the phrase: *Móros, who stole our pain* 

I carefully set the child down in her crib and watched her nestle comfortably. Her breathing was gentle and rhythmic, with each exhale a delicate sigh escaped. She looked so fragile and serene, as if held in a moment untouched by time. The soft rays of the afternoon sun filtered through the curtains, casting a warm glow across her smooth, pale skin.

“She’s beautiful, isn’t she?”

The voice of a man came from behind me. It felt like a lifetime ago but it was still familiar.

“She is,” I replied, not taking my eyes off the child.

The man joined me at my side and the two of us shared a quiet moment adoring the child.

“This is as close as I can be to her,” he said, somberly. “And yet you choose to continue suffering?”

“It’s not always suffering. There are moments like these that make the pain worth it.”

“Perhaps. But you live as long as I have, experience the highest of highs and the lowest of low…I tire of this infinite stasis. I yearn for the day I shut my eyes for the last time.”

He spoke with no emotion. As heart wrenching as his words were, it was as if he’s said them before countless times. There was only one question on my mind. After encountering conquest, war, famine, and now death, I wondered just who this man who claimed to be their father was.

“I know you’re thinking what kind of man I am to deserve this fate,” he said, as if reading my thoughts. “It’s not a divine punishment to care for them. It’s a father’s duty after all. They are born of my sin. I may have fathered humanity’s ruin but to see my fellow man struggle and fight, refusing to let their next breath be their last…I am in awe of your resilience.”

I should have felt hatred towards the man. I should have held him responsible for the horrors I endured. Yet, without another word shared between us, I stepped away from the crib, and took my leave. I shut the door as I left, the last thing I saw being the man standing over his child, his fists clenched so tightly that beads of blood trickled down the creases of his hands. 

I walked out the apartment, descended down the stairwell, entered into the lobby and finally, I stepped out of the building onto the bustling sidewalk. If not for the polaroid tucked away in my pocket, I might have tried to convince myself that it was all a fever dream for the sake of my sanity. I took the photo out just to confirm it. 

I studied it for a moment, confused that the picture had now changed. In place of the four horses that ran across the horizon now stood four children. Two boys and two girls. They watched as before them, a lone man stood atop a corpse with a caved in skull with a bloodied stone in his hand. I flipped the polaroid over and as I had predicted, the poem had also been replaced. 

It now simply read: *The folly of Cain*",1,1730286104.0,mrcreeps,0,1.0,False

1gfjg4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1gfjg4k/yet_another_headache_post/,Yet Another Headache Post,"I've read numerous posts on headaches and Quest 3 in this sub and in other places.

I get that often the culprit is the headstrap - I just wish I could be sure!

My story:

======== tldr - jump to the end tldr bit =======

I got a Quest 3 in December 2022 and a week before, I'd got an RTX 3060 12gb card - all good to go.

I suffered what I thought were the usual ""settling in"" signs, had the default strap - it was a bit uncomfortable, but not desperately so.

I could manage about 30 minutes, got my VR legs - but I kept getting headaches.

This is where it gets confusing.

Those headaches got worse and started manifesting as full on migraines complete with aura, which would make me feel nauseous and headachey for 48 hours after.

I did the usual experimentation and eventually settled for a Bobo halo strap.

This was a revelation - so much more comfortable - but still the headaches.

I gave up and sold the Quest 3, I couldn't deal with it anymore - I was taking sick days off work it got so bad.

A few weeks later, I was still getting them, so I ended up on a mission seeing specialists.  
Gave up drinking, gave up vaping, coffee, changed my diet.  
Went to see a neurologist - and he said I've just got standard migraines - ""take these tablets""  
I checked the side effects and thought ""screw that, they look worse than the migraines!""

I then bought a new monitor - high quality LG 4k.  
Still got migraines.

I then got a seriously bad cold/flu and was out of action for about 10 days - barely used my computer.

No headaches, no migraine!

It then dawned on me - the damn video card, the 3060 RTX I'd got 2 weeks before the Quest 3.

So I fired up some good old HL2 and some RDR2 - and low and behold, I started getting a headache almost immediately.

Got rid of the card and had to settle for a 1080ti instead.

No more headaches from computer use - but I'd sold my Quest 3.

============== end TLDR =========

I recently got a quest 3 on eBay again - worked out I didn't lose any money, mint condition.

But here I am back in a similar boat - set it up yesterday, whilst waiting for a Halo strap to arrive, was in VR for maybe 15 minutes.

That was 7pm last night.

I had a headache from 7.30pm till 10am this morning - it's only just fading now.

What concerns me the most is that I maybe just kidding myself that a Halo strap works.

My PD is 59 (yeah, I'm a freak!), which is right on the edge of the Quest 3 settings.

Thing is, I've found 60 or 61 is ""better"" - so I reckon my PD is more likely to be around 60.

Those apps aren't perfect.

I wear glasses for close up computer work and also for driving, but my vision at 1.5m is really good.

Optician says I don't need glasses for anything other than computer use, but my driving glasses do sharpen things up a little.

I'm going to try and dip in and out of VR in like 90 second bursts with an hour in-between, to adjust things - I can't be dealing with another 12 hour headache or potentially 2 days after a serious migraine.

I can immediately tell when I'm going to start getting a headache, but I stupidly ignored it last night.

Any tips other than the strap and PD are welcome at this stage.

Any stories or anecdotes that people have, that don't include the strap, would be great.

  
I'm actually scared to experiment now, the headaches have got so bad in the past - those 2 day sick/headache stints are seriously upsetting.

1gfjdok,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gfjdok/i_am_desperate_while_searching_for_a_new_coffee/,I am desperate while searching for a new coffee machine - please help [500€],"Hello coffee nerds,

I know that this comes up a lot, but I have not found a thread where all of my problems are addresses.

I am a coffee beginner (drink 2-3 espresso a day), and I currently own a Dedica + Sage grinder. I am thinking about buying a new machine. I want these things from new machine:

\- stable temperature  
\- 9 bar pressure  
\- no modding at first - I am not against modding, but I fear breaking a warranty. But, I would like to have a possibility of modding after 2 year warranty passes  
\- not be a manual (Flair)  
\- be under 500 € (I live in Central Europe)  
\- be a new machine (for now, I have ruled out buying an old machine....it would be difficult to find one in my country anyway)

It seems impossible to find a machine with such requirements. I was looking at Gaggia, Lelit and Sage. Gaggia requires modding (OPV, PID). Lelit has PID, but still needs to adjust OPV - thus breaking a warranty.

Sage seems to be in the middle (it does not require OPV adjust? Has PID), but is it that much better than my Dedica? I got an impression that Sage is not comparable with Gaggia or Lelit.

If there is no other option under 500€, should I just stick with my Dedica? I tried to switch to regular basket and coffee tastes a little bit better, but sometimes it is just terrible. My worry is the pressure. Sometimes, Dedica just gives up. I think that is due having 11-12 bar by default + additional pressure from fine-grinded coffee (am I right?).

So, is modding my Dedica the best option for me?

Or, is Gaggia, Lelit or Sage without modding that much better than Dedica, that is worth to spend that much money ? I got an impression that it is not, since you can tweak Dedica as well. After all, you only need a stable temperature and 9bars of pressure from your machine, right?

My LO (4m) has been in the thick of the shitty sleep phase for the last two weeks and it feels like there’s no end in sight. 

This really feels extra awful because he was sleeping through the night for about a month before this. He would go down at 7p, I’d dream feed at 10ish, and then he’d sleep until 6:30/7a.  

Now, it’s a struggle to get him to sleep and stay asleep, I dream feed at 10 still but now he wakes up at 2a to feed and then every few hours after that to be resettled. 

Naps have also been a joke. If I put him in the body carrier and walk, he’ll sleep the whole time. Otherwise, it’s a fight to get him to start asleep. 

I’ve taken him to the pediatrician and he is fine health wise. He’s just a 4 month old in that awful phase. I try to follow wake windows and make sure to feed him every 2-3 hours.  I also use a bedtime routine but have gotten into the bad habit of feeding him to sleep which is probably the main cause of my problem. 

To make it even worst, I go back to work next week. I know this gets better because my first born went through this same thing but it just feels so far away and I don’t know how I can sustain this lack of sleep and frustration.

I've been lurking this community for a couple of years now. I'm constantly amazed by the support you people show to each other, as well as the commitment for the cause by new and old community members.

Wanted to write down some themes I've discovered during my journey, mostly for my own journaling reasons (increasing my own commitment), but also as discussion starter. Hopefully these can be useful for some of you.

The streak is not the only way towards success. It might work for some, but for me, it ended up being more like another reason for stress (which leads to PMO). As with any other ""start/stop that"" project, such as getting fit, diet adjustments, alcohol/nicotine, I've found it more effective to focus on the trend: am I making progress? I don't strictly track my progress, but rather aim to reflect on it couple times a week. Regarding NoFap, I try to recall the last couple of times I fapped and how those felt. Then when the urges hit, I don't really have to convince myself much: I have semi-fresh memories of the last relapses and how those felt. Not to say I never relapse, but it's becoming less and less common.

The key for me has been to change my mindset about porn. I used to put it on the same level as sex with a partner, I now understand porn != masturbation. I truly believe there is nothing wrong about masturbation itself (sorry hardmode people). But in my experience, most of us tie those two together. So I've given myself a permission to fap without porn occasionally. At first, it didn't feel like much: as with porn, one can get aroused at any moment. Without it, I masturbate WHEN I'm horny, not to get horny. Forced erection / orgasm seem to be one of the worst things about PMO for me.

Another thing has been being very forgiving for myself. I am only a human, and I make mistakes. But I have also a track record of making hard things happen, and this is not the hardest of them. It's simply been part of my life for so long, it's one of the longest running habits, such as drinking my morning coffee. It's not anymore about the taste of coffee (porn), but the comfort of the habit (fap).

Finally, I wanted to highlight two ""lines of thought"" that keep me from relapsing.

1. When I end up opening an porn site, I scroll through the first page and find nothing that arouses me (as I'm numbed and overstimulated, you know). Previously, I had all kinds of search terms and all that jazz prepared to find me the perfect content. But now, I feel emptiness: very similar to post nut clarity. And that stops me right there, usually.

2. Another thing that gives me willpower is sex with a real person. I am in a happy position I am able to have sex approximately every 1-2 months with a person who I can be myself with, with all my ups and downs. I know that the less I consume porn, the more pleasure we both get when we are able to meet. I know quite many of you have SOs, so I hope you can use this to motivate yourself.

Sorry about the unstructured essay, this is my first Reddit post :) Having followed the sub for quite some time, I know there is not much novel in my line of thought. But for me, each post I have read has given me more motivation and insight into ways out of this misery. And I hope I am able to do the same for anyone who reads this.",1,1730284016.0,NoFap,0,1.0,False

Me and this girl had just ONE exchange of friendly banter and I crushed on her instantly. She is not even that attractive, but she was fun to work with and I liked how she was quiet and mostly kept to herself like me. Also she had nice blue eyes which didn't help because I couldn't stop looking at them. Since then I was doing weird shit like trying to subtly impress her by beating golf carts in races and stuff or randomly giving her 5 dollars because ""I don't really use cash"". 


On our last day we had a potluck and I worked up the courage to ask her out. My plan was to approach her at the end as we were on the way to the parking lot and calmly ask her out to coffee or lunch with no pressure or expectations, but to my surprise she had to leave like 30 minutes early, so I approach her right as she is trying to leave and ask. ""hey so do you want to grab a coffee sometime, like after this is over"" She is confused and says she's been really busy lately, and that she needs goes home and eat dinner and stuff. I say it's like a date, but not a date, then I attempt to get her number on my phone, or give mine to her but she is hesitant, (I can't remember exactly what she said) I have a brain fart and REALLY want her number, so say I will wait for her by the parking lot (which is on the other end of the park) so she can give me her number before her mom comes to get her(i noticed her mom pick her up once) when SHE is the one leaving early. I realize i am fucking up so to her surprise I whip out my number I had prewritten on a post-it as a last resort and tell her to shoot me a text if she ever wants to hang out or anything, this way she has to be the one to reach out to me. I said ""Okay see you later, maybe"" as she left. I took home the candies she brought as they would have been thrown away otherwise.


 In the moment I thought I did good as she seemed a little blushed but in retrospect I definitely set off a few red flags and probably told her mom all about me. I was beating myself up for it yesterday, I was all disappointed and stuff and have been replaying the scenario in my head and what I could have done different. I set up a facebook, instagram, and tinder to increase her chances of reaching out to me. It's been just two days now and no response. I'm thinking of throwing away her candy.

I am feeling a lot better now and am over her but still feel a little down. I am still hopeful she texts me within the next two weeks. Am I weird for being like this? ",1,1730283884.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

I can’t fucking drive, everybody is always busy or tired from work, I can’t even fucking afford it. Like we can’t afford much groceries.


I probably need money to enroll in a training program which I don’t have, to get a some type of job that needs skills that I don’t have, to get money to pay for such things, THAT I DON’T FUCKING HAVE. Do you see the problem? I’m stuck in an endless fucking loop with no hope. I’m too disabled to work, my request for SSD gets rejected nonstop, I’m extremely forgetful it’s distressing, I have no hopes or dreams for the future all because of fucking money, I know can’t handle a job because of my mental disabilities or at least a full-time one, I’m trapped in the same fucking cycle because I can’t do anything, I can’t even talk to my neighbors or anybody without my mom bitching at me, There’s no fucking hope.


I’m stuck in this endless fucking loop of hopelessness & helplessness. Even with suggestions my mom wouldn’t fucking listen me. I can’t do anything on my own so I’m trapped. I fucking hate this shit. I’m so fucking tired of everything.",1,1730283749.0,Vent,0,1.0,False
