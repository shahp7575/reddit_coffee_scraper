Since then, we‚Äôve talked almost daily or every two to three days, but very briefly mostly just ‚Äúhow are you‚Äù type of conversations. I‚Äôve initiated all of them.

On the fourth day after the breakup, I suggested going on a hike, and she said she‚Äôd think about it. Now, after a month, she told me she‚Äôd like to go on that hike but is afraid to meet up with me because she knows how good she feels in my presence. She also said she wants to keep her rational side active when we meet.

I didn‚Äôt reply to her message, and three hours later, she said she‚Äôd like to take a train trip to my city so we could meet for coffee. I video-called her to set up the details, and she was extremely happy to see me. It felt like we were talking as we did on the first day we met.

A few hours later, she texted me saying she couldn‚Äôt come anymore because she had something to take care of at work. I get the impression that she triggered herself after seeing how well we were interacting.

Is this the moment to insist on seeing her, or should I leave her alone? I want her back, but I don‚Äôt want to trigger her even more, nor do I want to regret not doing something at this crucial moment.",1,1740679928.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

We listened to all of the feedback and we moved the green chair out of the room. Some people suggested pulling it out and tilting it towards the middle but honestly there‚Äôs no room. It definitely looks a lotttttt better, though please ignore the wires on the left, they will be dealt with. We will also be adding a sheer curtain to the window, possibly a very subtle tan checkered one. 


We are still on the fence about a coffee table, mainly because it would take away a lot of walking area and prevent us from moving the ottoman around. 


The dilemma now is our above couch decor‚Ä¶. We thought we would like these forest canvases but something feels off‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve been torn on if we should make it a gallery wall instead, incorporating maybe a small antique mirror, shelves, plants etc. This current set-up feels too boring but sometimes like today in the sunlight, I do kinda like it. I should also note that this couch is massive at 10 feet long, so it makes all artwork look small lol. 
Thoughts?!

Why? Because who you surround yourself with matters. The right community pushes you to go after what you want, encourages you to learn and improve, lifts you up when you stumble. It's also great to have friends to grab coffee with.  
  
And where do you find them? Coworking spaces are a great place to start. They offer:  
  
ü§ù Collaboration - everyone's there to get stuff done. You might just have an expert sitting next to you who can give you the advice you need to succeed. Which leads us to‚Ä¶  
  
üí°Diverse perspectives - working alongside other nomads from around the world can expand your mind with new ideas and spark conversations that lead to lasting relationships  
  
Can getting to know new people be awkward? Sure. But if you take the first step in a new, shared environment, chances are you'll meet another nomad like you who's searching for their tribe.

1izlwfj,https://i.redd.it/xrs6s6azzple1.jpeg,Anyone have a link to this one?,"My breath caught, snatched away by some unseen force, the moment I saw my mate, Matthew‚ÄîAlpha of the Silver Crescent Pack‚Äîdrop to one knee before my cousin Alessia, a Delta in our pack. 

He, my mate, was proposing to her, right there in the heart of our mate ceremony party.

Alessia‚Äôs rare illness had flared up again, draining her wolf‚Äôs strength, and she‚Äôd been desperate for a formal mating ceremony. To grant her that dying wish, Matthew, my mate, shredded the plans I‚Äôd spent months painstakingly weaving together.

He didn‚Äôt even glance at me with pity. Instead, his eyes locked on mine, cold and contemptuous, his Alpha voice slicing through the air like a blade. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you find a shred of compassion? She‚Äôs your cousin, and her time‚Äôs running out. ""

""Is this ceremony worth more to you than her life?‚Äù

The pack‚Äôs curious stares bore into me, and the rose petals strewn across the floor seemed to mock me, their beauty stinging my eyes with unshed tears.

Later, after escaping the venue, I called Hank, Beta of the Moon Shadow Pack. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done. I‚Äôll join your pack and get things rolling.‚Äù
....

I spent the whole day at a coffee shop and only returned the packhouse when it was dark. Alpha Matthew had just finished showering, a towel casually draped over his muscular frame as he stepped out of the bathroom. When he saw me, he greeted me as if I were a stranger.

‚ÄúWhy are you so late?‚Äù His detached expression felt as cold as his words on this warm summer night. Today, at what was supposed to be our mating ceremony, he had knelt before Alessia, sliding onto her finger the ring he had meant for me.

Alessia‚Äôs eyes filled with tears of surprise as red roses fell around them. They embraced among the pack members, and Matthew tenderly wiped her tears, his voice softening as he warned her, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry. Your health is fragile; you have to stay calm.‚Äù

What should have been my mating ceremony left me awkwardly standing in the corner, feeling completely out of place. Noticing my discontent, Matthew‚Äôs mood soured immediately, his alpha aura pressing down on me.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a ceremony, not the actual marking. Why do you have to make such a big deal out of it?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs your cousin, and to be honest, she doesn‚Äôt mean anything to me. If even I, a mere outsider, can show sympathy for her, why can‚Äôt you?‚Äù

Yes, why couldn‚Äôt I make room for someone supposedly at death‚Äôs door? Everyone accused me of being small-minded. But was she really suffering from a relapse?

Alessia and I grew up together, just a few months apart in age. She was always the favorite‚Äîcharming and skilled at winning people over. Our elders clearly favored her more.

Meeting Matthew was a stroke of chance. Our packs had collaborated before, and we both handled external communications. Our frequent interactions brought Matthew and me closer, evolving into friends who could talk about anything. He knew my backstory well‚Äîmy mother remarried, my father was irresponsible and gambled, and the elders always favored Alessia. I had grown up without anyone‚Äôs affection.

Matthew claimed to love me, especially when we found we were each other's fated mate. He promised me a home and the mating ceremony of my dreams. I fell for his sweet lies, and we entered a passionate relationship leading to the altar.

Two months before the ceremony, Alessia, my cousin, citing her illness, wanted to be involved in planning the event. That‚Äôs how Matthew met her. They connected instantly, like long-lost friends reunited. Even when Alessia wasn‚Äôt around, Matthew was engrossed in texting her, his phone constantly in hand.

The engagement party seemed like it was made for them.

As rain began to fall outside, Alpha Matthew sat across from me, ready to recap the day‚Äôs events, but his phone rang before he could speak. Though the caller ID showed no name, I immediately recognized Alessia‚Äôs number.

Why wasn‚Äôt her number saved? Was he avoiding being caught chatting with her, or had he memorized it by heart? I didn‚Äôt dwell on it too long; some truths are just too painful to confront.

Alessia‚Äôs frail voice came through the phone. ‚ÄúAlpha, can you come over? The lights here won‚Äôt turn on, and with a big storm coming, I‚Äôm worried something might happen.‚Äù

Matthew agreed, reaching for his coat. My cousin calling my mate was already absurd, but the fact he went without consulting me was even more outrageous, as if he was free as a bird, while my love for him kept me chained.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go check on Alessia. If the storm gets bad, I might not come back tonight,‚Äù Matthew said as he shut the door behind him.

Since then, a haunting silence has settled over our home. Perhaps Matthew forgot how much I dread thunderstorms.",1,1740678872.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

i am so scared of going under and them testing this thing. i get why they do it but my mind goes in a horrible place. i have two little girls and that honeslty why i am doing this. 

My EP stated that because it wasnt sustained (30seconds) that he reccomends it, but risks are still low (not his exact words but something like that). Also my loop caught it because I clicked it not because my HR went above treshold so they dont know how many I have actually had with me not being good at pressing my loop recorder.
My cardiologist also reccommended ICD. Both pretty much stating if i was part of their family, they would want me to get it. 

edit to add - i can only take 20mg of nadolol before my bp and hr tank. 

is this enough to get an ICD ? i mean i trust my DRs i guess im just second guessing lol

did you guys only sleep on the couch with a bunch of pillows? my smallest is 5months and obv still wakes up at night and is next to me in the bed. 

im guessing i should just go braless with baggy t-shirts for a good six weeks. 

with long qt we arnt suppose to take ssris, but w anxiety/postpartum i would like to go back on zoloft. has anyone gone back on a med AFTER getting icd because yoy have that life insurance. - same with energy drinks because i dont drink coffee and i had to stop energy drinks when i found out abt long qt almost two years ago and im tired ü´†

However, today when I was making myself tea she asked me to make her earl grey as well. I was surprised and asked if she was sure while trying to nudge her in the direction of changing her mind.

**Primary Complaint:** heart palpitations, increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and chest tightness

I apologize in advance that this is going to be a long post, but there are a lot of details and independent variables to share. Any potential insight that can be offered is much appreciated.

On December 5th, 2024, I was diagnosed with chronic migraines by a neurologist, due to experiencing headaches, dizziness, neck pain, and a host of other symptoms for 6 months prior. I'm not entirely convinced chronic migraines are the issue; they may be a symptom, but I don't think they are the cause of my symptoms. I do get true migraines - with the visual aura - but only a few times a year. Anyway, the neurologist prescribed me propranolol, 10mg twice a day (so 20mg total per day) as a migraine preventative, and rizatriptan as a migraine rescue, which I have not needed to take yet.

Immediately upon starting the propranolol, I was incredibly fatigued. Then after a few weeks, I started experiencing intense heart palpitations, an increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and chest tightness and discomfort. After experiencing these symptoms on and off for a week, I got in to see my PCP on January 2nd, 2025. She did an EKG, which was normal. She tried to tell me my symptoms sounded like anxiety, and I flat out told her no, it was not anxiety, I know what anxiety feels like, and this isn't it. And aside from my health, I don't have a lot of significant stressors in my life at the moment. I asked her if the propranolol could be causing these symptoms, and she said possibly, so I decided to stop taking the propranolol. After a few days, the heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest tightness subsided, though my heart rate remained elevated. In fact, the health app on my phone alerted me that my average walking heart rate was higher than normal, by about 20bpm (I wear an Apple watch every day).

After messaging my neurologist to tell him I had to stop the propranolol, he then prescribed me topiramate, 25mg nightly. At first, the only side effects I noticed were loss of appetite and some visual changes, such as stronger/more noticeable visual snow, increased sensitivity to bright lights, and palinopsia. I went to an ophthalmologist on January 20th, but they could not find anything that would explain my visual symptoms.

Now, over the last few weeks, my heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest tightness have returned, and they've gotten stronger and more consistent. My heart rate sky rockets and I'm out of breath going up one flight of stairs, which is not at all normal for me. I get these symptoms throughout the day, whether I'm sitting or standing. My heart rate goes up a lot when I'm doing any sort of physical activity, even just walking at a normal pace. I'm also experiencing pain in the front of my neck and under my jaw, though I'm not sure if I could have swollen lymph nodes, or if it could be caused by sinus issues (which I talk about below).

At my appointment on January 2nd, my PCP ordered blood work, a chest X-ray, stress test, and holter monitor.

* **Blood Work, January 3rd:**
   * TSH: 3.74 (I take levothyroxine, which I'll discuss further below)
   * CBC w/differential: all normal

* **Chest X-Ray, January 7th:** ""The lungs are clear and there are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, pulmonary vasculature, and hilar structures are normal. The skeletal structures are unremarkable for age.""
   * Total Exercise Time: 9 minutes 38 seconds (I was told to stop because when I started running, my breasts were causing the readings to go wild)

Finally, on February 5th, I came down with some sort of viral infection. It started as a bad sore throat for three days, then I developed a cough and congestion, which was pretty bad for about 5-6 days. I was tested for strep at a clinic, but the test was negative. I took several COVID + flu tests at home over the course of 3 days, and all of the tests were negative. I never had a fever during the course of the illness. Although I've improved, I still have a lingering dry cough and congestion, and I'm wondering if I might have developed a sinus infection, as I've felt some pain in my cheeks and teeth. I bring this up in case it's at all relevant to my symptoms, although my symptoms started before I got sick.

A few other details, in case they're helpful or relevant:

* I've had COVID three times over the years: August 2022, November 2023, and September 2024.
* Between 2021 and 2023, I was drinking pretty moderately and consistently. I started cutting back in 2024, and as of December 26th, 2024, I have not had any alcohol. My AST and ALT have consistently been normal (between 15 and 20), and when I had an abdominal ultrasound in September 2024, my liver was fine, as were all of my other organs they looked at (pancreas, kidneys, etc).
* I do drink coffee, but I've been cutting back to one cup of half-calf coffee, partly because of my heart issues.
* I usually go for a 30-45 minute walk every day, but haven't had the stamina to do so these last few weeks. I also usually go hiking on the weekends, but again, I just haven't had the stamina for it.
* I eat relatively healthy: I've cut back on red and processed meat, I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, I love having overnight oats for breakfast, etc. And I drink a TON of water.
* Thyroid: I started taking levothyroxine in late 2022, after blood work showed mild hypothyroidism. I've been taking 75mcg daily. Out of curiosity, I got another TSH test done through Labcorp on February 3rd, and my TSH was 2.38, so it had dropped 1.36 points in one month without a change in medication. I plan to bring up this drop with my PCP.
* My A1C was tested on January 21st, and it was 5.2.
* I've lost about 10 pounds since the start of the year, which could be from a combination of cutting out alcohol and the topiramate affecting my appetite. I would like to get down to 140lbs, which has always been my standard weight, up until a few years ago.
* I have been told by my physical therapist, chiropractor, and podiatrist that I am hyper mobile, and I am trying to get assessed for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.
* After two MRIs in 2013, I was told I have a chiari malformation. None of my recent doctors seem to think that's relevant to my headaches, dizziness, etc.

So my question is... what now? I'm going to make a follow-up appointment with my PCP, but I'm nervous about having more tests ordered, because I've already spent hundreds of dollars since the start of the year on these tests (even with health insurance, because health insurance sucks). But of course, I'm also scared of having a serious medical issue that has yet to be diagnosed. I also stop myself from reaching out to doctors because I don't want my symptoms dismissed as anxiety.

I'm trying not to stress myself out (which I know will only exacerbate my symptoms), but I can't help but wonder if I'm experiencing some sort of serious heart or lung issue that just hasn't been caught yet. I also worry that the propranolol caused some sort of lingering issue, or that maybe I'm now having a bad reaction to the topiramate. I know I ultimately need to follow-up with my PCP, which I will, but I'm just wondering if anybody on here as any insights or ideas.

1izlo2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Smart-With-Debt/comments/1izlo2a/what_is_a_fixed_rate/,What is a fixed rate?,"Today we are going to answer the question, ‚Äúwhat is a fixed rate?‚Äù A **fixed rate** is a steady, unchanging interest rate on a loan. No surprises. No sudden jumps. You lock in one rate, and it stays the same for the life of the loan.

Think of it like locking in the price of your favorite coffee. If you could pay the same $3 per cup for 30 years, no matter how much prices rise, that can make a big difference in the long run.

For example, if you get a **fixed-rate mortgage** at 6%, your monthly payment stays the same, even if market rates go up to 8% or drop to 4%. That means **predictability** in your budget.

The opposite is a **variable rate**, which can change over time. That might start lower, but it can go up, sometimes way up.

This option is great when interest rates are low or when you want **stable, predictable payments**. It keeps your budget in check and helps avoid surprises.

Whenever i (15F) get overwhelmed by stuff like constant scolding by elders or when i feel too lonely like if i get reminded of someone or something that hurted me once or was just uk a part of my past that i didnt really like, i dont know how to explain this cuz i dont know what it is - but my calves start to hurt uhm its like tingling or like i cant really stand on my own n my head starts to feel dizzy n i start taking deep breaths idk if its a panic attack or smth cuz it keeps getting triggered at random times n btw it's serious though it feels like i get too aware of my surroundings its like uhm an adrenaline rush for no reason. Like i be chilling in my room ( i never leave the house) n still get these random anxiety attacks n i feel like i should block everyone i know or i should ghost everyone .
Plus i dont get hungry , i never get hungry . I have tried various kinds of food n i still dont have smth as favourite or like a comfort food n i dont get those random cravings except for coffee or maybe chocolates. I can go on without eating anything for 1-2 days easily n still be fine . I m 5'6 n weight around 50kgs i guess it still counts as healthy or idk but people have always made fun of me by saying i m too skinny so i hv always tried to eat properly. Its been in my new year resolutions for last two years to gain weight but my body n mind never go hand in hand.
I have never been my parents favourite i mean forget about favourite, they dont even show any kind of necessary affection that they should to their child. They always talk shit about me to everyone, my younger sis gets so much affection n care from them - i mean they never even cared about me once ever since my sis was born cuz since then i m the older child who is always supposed to be mature n understanding. What she gets at being 10 yrs old wasnt given to me at 10 yrs old cuz i have always been oldER. 
Idk why but never in my life i have had good n real frds , why does everyone have to have double standards, why do they change , why do they lie sm , why do they give false hopes , n what not ! Imagine not having even a single healthy female frdship (dont ask me about men , i hv talked to very few) .
I have my finals going on , its going uhm fine i guess but i haven't prepared for tomorrow's exam . I m just so mentally exhausted that i cant think of doing anything productive cuz i m so busy just trying to feel fucking normal.
Gonna be in hostel from next month onwards . 
In my life the only thing that has stayed with me or smth that has uplifted me everytime is music -  radiohead , mitski, the marias , cults , the beatles n some nu metal bands .
If u really read all of this then uhm thanks. 
Tbh it wasnt really a vent but series of thoughts from my mind that i tried noting down . Posting it here cuz i don't know what other subreddit to do it to.
If possible please help me to know why i hv problems with eating n being social , n why tf do i have it . 
Uhm yeah well i have gone through some traumatic stuff in my childhood that i cant share , n i hv noticed one thing that i cant remember much stuff from the time period when all of it happened like if i try remembering smth from that time period of 3-4 yrs its just the trauma n ntg else that crosses my mind , in fact i guess i was so depressed that i had stopped brushing n taking baths too in those days atleast m doing better now(comparitively).",1,1740678061.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

Unfortunately there is no safe space for an orthodox Jewish women to post about men in the community. If we speak up, the community will grab their own doctors and medicate you to shut up.*

yesterday I went out with my kids to get a smoothee. As I left a nice Frum lady opened the door for me so I can push my stroller out. I thought that was really nice of her because you don't really get that anymore in the Frum world. As we were leaving the restaurant I saw a guy in the typical black hat/ penguin outfit and he was rushing to to restaurant. He was calling someone multiple times and it went to voicemail. He starts yelling ""I don't see a hechsher! Where is the hechsher for the restaurant?"" Instead of asking me where the hechsher is or if the place is kosher he just keeps yelling at me about where the hechsher is. I ignore him and pick up my son from tutoring that was next door.

As I come out, the lady that held the door for me earlier was with they black hat penguin guy. He started visibly yelling at her that I heard the whole conversation. He basically got a notification on the phone that there was a transaction while he was at work. He then left work and went to the restaurant where the transaction came from. Upon getting there even though the place didn't have a hechsher on the window, it was kosher approved by the star K. He asked exactly what the lady ordered. He freaked out when she ordered a coffee with coconut milk. And the worst part, he got mad that she fed the baby a fruit salad. As I stood on the side with my kids, I didn't know if I should intervene or not. In the end, I feel sorry for her because she was kind and all she wanted was to go out with her baby on a nice sunny day. She didn't deserve that. And if she wanted someone to intervene, I'm sorry I didn't.

I've had my share as well. When we went to a restaurant for my son's fifth birthday. My father sent the money for us to go and treat the kids. My ""husband"" started to order stuff for ourselves and the kids. As time went on and the food came. He started arguing because he wanted me to do some tax paperwork for his business. I told him I was uncomfortable with doing that because he wanted to deduct stuff as a write off that wasn't and I would have to certify that as his bookkeeper and place my name on it. He specifically brought that up when it was a night out with the kids on my father's dime. And I tried to avoid that conversation. But then he started to yell and threaten to disappear. He also started to scream at the kids and eat their food and slamming things. What shocked me was that I was in a busy restaurant and nobody came in and intervened. The waitresses did nothing. The owner did nothing. The customers sat and watched us. I even asked if someone would call the cops. Nothing happened.

Or the time when my 2 year old daughter was playing by her room and she accidentally locked herself in her room while I was taking a shower. I called my husband for help and he didn't really offer any advice other than too bad. And when I called my father who lives near by, the same reaction happened of too bad. In the end, I got a locksmith to open it. 

In the end. I'm so done with men. I truly crave having a quiet home that is clean. Some days I wish to just go to work and come home and eat ramen on the couch while I watch tv. Some days I wish I wouldn't be threatened with divorce if I want to go travelling to the Patagonia of Argentina and chile. I try to have a relationship with him by talking about things about my day like what happened at the smoothie restaurant but instead he demanded that I shut up and crack eggs for his kasha. Then he demands that I smile and come back and eat his kasha. He knows I hate kasha. He knows I think that kasha with scrambled eggs and honey mixed together is gross. But since he made it, he forces me to eat it when I don't want it. But when I make food I don't force him to eat it. And quite often he gets mad when I'm not interested in him talking about his job. In fact it's kinda boring hearing a truck driver talk about pallets, and how to load a truck and the road.its fun at first but it gets boring when you hear the same everyday. 

I don't need a man to satisfy my sexual urges we have our own devices that do just fine and I can control. I don't need a man to unlock the door I can pay a locksmith. I don't need a man talk to I can pay a therapist. I don't need a man to have a baby, I can pay the sperm bank and raise the kid how I want to and not have a clash of opinions. I don't need a father or husband to protect me. I can call the cops anyways, a gun is better than someone's fists. I don't need a man to provide, I can get a job. This is the logic all women need. We need money and independence not a man.

Bastards hurt, too. Especially on days she had too much salt on her fries.!<

>!Tonight, however, Misato‚Äôs own health was the least of her concerns. It was *the boy* that worried her. The same skinny twig of a kid standing right before her, just an arm‚Äôs length away. So close she could reach out and poke him. Perhaps she already had. Perhaps she had done just that‚Ä¶!<

>!Shinji. Shinji Ikari. Fourteen. Somehow this boy turned out to be humanity‚Äôs last hope against the Angels (don't ask), with *Misato Katsuragi*, the alcoholic, assigned as his sole guardian for the duration of his training.!<

>!Shinji wore a white button-down, tucked neatly into a pair of loose black slacks, looking like a young Mormon missionary ready for pilgrimage. Except there would be no Sunday school for Shinji. Not for a while‚Äînot for a really long time. Not after tonight‚Ä¶!<

>!The boy‚Äôs hand was glued to the side of his head, his nervous fingers gently massaging the hair behind his temples‚Äîthe exact place where the bottle had struck. No. Where *she* had struck him just seconds ago.!<

>!*Wham!*!<

>!When it hit, green sparks filled his eyes like Christmas lights. His hand flew to his ear to check if it was still there. Yet all Shinji felt was his jet-black hair, slick to the touch, like someone had doused it in motor oil. Didn‚Äôt even sting at first.!<

>!*Maybe it‚Äôs the champagne?*!<

>!Once the initial spike of cortisol had waned, searing pain began to radiate across his face. Spreading slowly, like poison spreads. Shinji‚Äôs mind flashed back to the day after soccer practice when his friend Toji‚Äôs fist had smacked him square in the mouth. That fist had felt like kiss on the lips compared to this, which was more akin to having a firecracker go off inside your ear canal. Were he to gaze into a mirror, he‚Äôd expect to see a pink swollen mug staring right back at him‚Äîa huge, ripe tomato ready to burst.!<

>!*Shouldn‚Äôt have skipped all that dodgeball practice*, Shinji thought as his fingers traced gingerly along the outer rim of his earlobe, which by now had swollen to the respectable size of a fleshy puffball and felt numb to the touch.!<

>!*Shouldn‚Äôt have mentioned Kaji*. An invisible beast gnawed at his temple, raking its grubby claws against the walls of his skull, trying to dig its way out.!<

>!Shinji and Misato had their share of spats before, predominantly garden-variety bullshit. Like Shinji leaving droplets of piss on the toilet seat: a cold, wet surprise for her bare ass in the morning. Or that hot summer day Misato found her beer cans cooking on the windowsill‚Äîthe kid had to free the fridge for Rice Krispies. She wasn‚Äôt too mad, though she had him down a daily plate of sloppy oat gruel for an entire month following the incident. *No Yebisu for me, no sugar lumps for you. We‚Äôre even, Steven.*!<

>!Even then, punishments never went beyond a gentle dose of lighthearted discipline. The closest Misato ever came to raising a hand was playfully tugging his ear once she caught him peeping muted pay-per-view channels at three in the morning. Wouldn‚Äôt stop teasing him about it for weeks.!<

>!That was then.!<

>!Shinji parted his lips to speak when sudden, glassy pain lit up his jaw like a jukebox. He winced, snapped his mouth shut, and let it subside. The pain was shocking. The realization even more so. Never in his life had he encountered such unbridled savagery before. A loving mother would sooner douse herself in gasoline and strike a match than hurt her own child. But to Misato‚Äîmother of none‚Äîno such rules applied. She had whipped that bottle through the air with primal ferocity, and Shinji, being Shinji, just stood there and took it.!<

>!He pressed his palm harder against the wound, as if trying to stem a burst pipe. A thin line, sharp and solid as a red cord, managed to escape, snaking its way down his wrist and tracing along his arm. Misato‚Äôs eyes shot open like startled owl‚Äôs, pupils dilating to bring in more light as she watched Shinji‚Äôs lifeblood collect in a dark, glistening bead on his elbow. It swelled larger and larger still until‚Ä¶!<

>!*Plok.*!<  
>!A single red teardrop landed on the grime-encrusted linoleum. !<

>!Plok.!<  
>!Then another.!<

>!*Plok, plok!*!<  
>!A third, and a fourth.!<

>!The light taps echoed through the room, Misato‚Äôs heart skipping a beat after every single one. The sound sent her back to her aunt‚Äôs vintage bathroom, the steady *drip-drip-drip* from the faucet amplified by the moldy tiles with their dank, musty smell‚Äîthat pungent mix of dead water, rotting wood, and the sickly-sweet odor of mildew that clung to every surface. The kind of smell that made you want to hold your breath. The kind that seemed to coat your tongue and linger in your nostrils long after you‚Äôd left the room. She could taste it now, her breath caught in her throat as it dawned on her that tonight was no mere leak. Tonight it poured‚Äînot from the sky, but from Shinji. And within a few minutes the entire floor around his feet was covered in rubies.!<

>!Shinji‚Äôs brown eyes darted to the speckled floor below, then to his own shirt. There were stains. Dark ones. Like blots of ink on white paper.!<

>!*Wait.* *Champagne isn‚Äôt red.*!<

>!The boy‚Äôs lungs seized up. Short, ragged gasps. His face, already pale, drained of what little color remained. His body swayed slightly, one hand clutching his head, the other pressed against his hip as if trying to hold himself together. Across the room, Misato stood frozen, mouthing soundlessly like a goldfish out of water.!<

>!Their eyes met. There was that instant of heat, like a power surge when all the needles swing into overload. If Shinji‚Äôs eyes could speak, they‚Äôd scream: ‚ÄúI trusted you.‚Äù But when he finally managed to crack his jaws open, all she heard was a measly: ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù!<

>!Misato jerked forward, hand snapping to her mouth as bile rose up in her throat. On her shoulder, the yellow NERV badge cast occasional glints of light against the walls. One such light caught the boy‚Äôs eye, another one hit the window and reflected back at her. A bead of sweat trailed down the small of her back. It was at that moment when the fog of booze was washed away and chilling clarity took place. *What have I done?*!<

>!No longer was she stumbling through the neon-lit alleys of Shinjuku, where streets reeked of rats, rice, and venereal disease. No longer was she rebuffing the lecherous advances of drunken salarymen outside seedy Pachinko parlors. No, this was home. This was real. And it wasn‚Äôt some washed-up barfly gawking at her with bloodshot eyes and teeth stained with whiskey. It was Shinji Ikari‚Äîthe pilot, the ward, the boy whose skull she had cracked like an empty bottle of convenience store vodka dropped on the sidewalk.!<

>!*Oh no. Oh dear God no.* Misato clenched her eyes as tightly as she could, then forced them open again, expecting to wake up in some parallel universe‚Äîa universe where she finds herself knocked out next to the washing machine, covered in puke, passing kidney stones in the early hours of the morning. She‚Äôd give anything to be bathing in her own filth right now. Anything over this.!<

>!But as she opened her eyes, nothing had changed‚Äîexcept for the floor that had grown ever more spotty, and Shinji, who had grown ever more pale. Misato thought he looked like a boy turned stone, frozen in place as he gazed into the eyes of an ancient monster. The same monster who, for the last nine months, had been burning his toast, washing his tees, and sniffing his briefs after cleaning.!<

>!The boy spoke again. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù!<

>!That feeble voice‚Äîan icepick through her gut. *Fuck.* Was this kid genetically engineered to be this heart-wrenchingly pitiful? Was this what torture felt like? *I‚Äôm sorry, ‚Äúenhanced interrogation‚Äù*. Was this what the huntsman felt when he emptied a buckshot into the rustling leaves nearby, only to realize seconds after that it wasn‚Äôt the deer hiding in the bushes, but his very own son?!<

>!Amidst the chaos of her thoughts, among the flurry of what ifs and what nows, a colder, more calculating part of her brain kicked in, starting to ask questions of more practical nature:!<

>!*Will he talk? Will he tell?*!<  
>!*Will I get fired? Will I go to jail?*!<  
>!*Will he‚Ä¶ will he‚Ä¶ will he liv‚Äî*!<

>!He moved. Took the first step towards her. Heavy. Sluggish. A step of a phlegmatic zombie in a low-budget horror. With his face spectral white and bloodied hand seemingly sewn to his temple, he sure could‚Äôve auditioned for one. His eyes, however, were alive and there was a hint of danger in them.!<

>!After what felt like wading through quicksand, Shinji finally came to a standstill‚Äîface-to-face with the woman who was not his !<mother>!. They were so close she could taste the Juicy Fruit bubblegum on his breath as he exhaled a soft sigh of disappointment. His gaze, no longer vacant, now drilled through her, signaling telepathically it was her turn to speak.!<

>!*Explain yourself‚Ä¶ Now.*!<

>!Misato was about to spew an apology, but her throat constricted, words cut off as if amputated by a scalpel. Apology wasn‚Äôt enough. How about a deal? A brand new video game every day of the week for three months straight‚Äîno, forever. As long as this remains between them that is. *Goddam, bribing a kid, seriously? Misato, you rotten piece of garbage.*!<

>!‚ÄúShinji, !<I>!‚Äî‚Äù!<

>!Misato‚Äôs hands reached out for him. Part of her expected the boy to recoil from her touch as if she were a venomous snake. Instead, he reached back, his blood-slicked fingers intertwining with her trembling ones. Now they both looked like a pair of kids who‚Äôd done finger paints.!<

>!‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù he said in a voice that was hardly there. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna be alright.‚Äù!<

>!Will it though?!<

>!That‚Äôs when Shinji‚Äôs world began to whirl and rotate like a centrifuge in outer space, the edges of his vision blurring in and out of focus in slow, woozy cycles. An odd sense of lightness filled his limbs. For a moment, he thought he‚Äôd ascend from the ground and simply float away, pass right through the ceiling, drift through the drywall and transcend the room above. Rising higher and higher up into the sky like a mylar balloon aiming for moon, passing through the cables and the powerlines, soaring beyond the rooftops and the satellites, above the neon signs and the window lights, further and further away from that wicked place where crime took place, until the entire city of Tokyo-3 had shrunk to the size of a tiny white bead below his feet, while above him lay an endless veil of black velvet studded with a billion stars. ‚ÄúCome and surrender,‚Äù it said. Surrender to the vast windless sky as it shifts its cosmic hue from faded blue denim to the purple-black of a festering womb.!<

>!Shinji took a deep breath. The smell of ozone filled his lungs. Was this the smell of heaven? The buzzing in his ears‚Äîwas it the angels calling?!<

>!But he couldn‚Äôt join them. Not quite yet. Not before the new Mortal Kombat comes out‚Äîthe one with real blood and guts, where you can rip out spines and stuff. Not before‚Ä¶ not before he gets his first kiss, too. Besides, he already had a fallen angel at home: a celestial alcoholic named Misato Katsuragi, courtesy of NERV. She had her bad days, but she‚Äôll fix it. Like she always does. Shinji was sure of it.!<

>!*Stop!*!<

>!Shinji‚Äôs grip tightened around Misato‚Äôs fingers with unnatural force, crushing them until he almost broke her pinky. Her body jerked back in a painful spasm, yet his grip held on and clamped down even harder. *Hold on, hold on tight, boy, for she is your last remaining lifeline in this dark world that follows.*!<

>!Misato looked down and froze. Shinji‚Äôs hands were gone, replaced with a pair of sharp iron hooks sinking slowly into the soft meat of her palms like hot pincers. A shrill scream shredded her her throat as she fought against his grip. ‚ÄúGet off me.‚Äù!<

>!Misato tore herself free from Shinji, regretting it immediately. His hands were fine. The hooks were gone. But his shirt was soaked red and his shoulders‚Äîthey swayed. Back and forth. Penduluming. Then his eyes rolled back and his entire body began to collapse in slow motion. Misato lunged forward, scooping him up by the armpits. They sank to the ground glued together. Her knees hit the floor first. Hard. A crack echoed through the room. Not loud, but sharp and crisp like a dry branch snapping, followed by a stifled cry through clenched teeth. The bright, brilliant pain was instantly numbed by shot of adrenaline flooding her veins like jet fuel. To hell with the pain. Can‚Äôt let him bleed‚Äîwon‚Äôt let him bleed.!<

>!Her hand latched onto his wound, long splayed fingers wrapping around his skull like a spider. Now she felt it, too‚Äîthe oozy, slick surface of his scalp. His pulse throbbed against her palm. Each beat sending a fresh gush of blood that oozed between her fingers, warm like mother‚Äôs milk. A few droplets hit her thigh with light, hot licks.!<

>!*Shit. Probably nicked an artery.*!<

>!Misato‚Äôs mind flashed back to her NERV emergency training; the clinical, dry voice of that blonde bitch Ritsuko droning on about trauma management.!<

>!*Humans can typically lose around 15 percent of blood before the body starts experiencing signs of hypovolemia.* For a scrawny teenager like Shinji that was probably about two cans of soda, but Misato couldn‚Äôt be sure. About 20 percent of those classes she attended bored out of her mind.!<

>!*At 30 percent blood loss, the body‚Äôs compensatory mechanisms begin to fail. Organ damage sets in, and without a transfusion, death is imminent.*!<

>!She scanned the floor trying to gauge how much Shinji had already lost. *Too much.*!<

>!Her eyes fixed on the nearby sofa. A crumpled grey dishrag hung over the armrest. Shinji‚Äôs mess, no doubt.!<

>!*This will do.* Misato knew if she stopped the bleeding right-fucking-now, there was still a chance, slim as it may be, the kid might live to see a brand new Playstation under the Christmas tree.!<

>!Everything that happened next, happened fast, but to Shinji Ikari it all seemed slow; it all seemed to happen in a series of shutter-clicks, like a set of action panels in a Japanese manga.!<

>!In the first panel, Misato had her arm extended towards the sofa, snatching the dishrag by the corner. Her other hand cupped his head, pushing the boy‚Äôs face against her chest. Scent of Chanel No. 5 filled his nose.!<

>!In the second panel, she was wrapping the towel around his head like a turban with surgical agility. The fabric grew pregnant with blood, a soggy wet sponge between her fingers. *Don‚Äôt you bleed out on me, you little asshole. Please, God, let him stay with me‚Ä¶*!<

>!In the third panel, Misato had both ends of the dishrag in her hands, pulling them with psychotic strength, tightening the knot around Shinji‚Äôs skull ‚Äôtil her knuckles went white.!<

>!Shinji made a sound.!<

>!That gave her hope. *Good. There‚Äôs still some fight left in him.*!<

>!Her other hand, now free from restraints, slid inside her jacket. Trembling, slick fingers were feeling around for the familiar shape of her sturdy old Nokia. The phone fumbled in her pocket, slipping from her grasp each time she was about to seize it. Taunting her.!<

>!‚ÄúGoddamnit,‚Äù she hissed through gritted teeth. ‚ÄúWhere the hell is it?‚Äù!<

>!A moment of struggle, and she had the phone planted firmly in her hand. Always kept it close to heart‚Äîcould stop bullets, they said. Then they said it gives you cancer. *You take the rough with the smooth, I guess.*!<

>!Misato yanked it out, smearing Shinji‚Äôs blood across the keypad. But when the tiny screen came to life, her guts cramped up. *Battery Low*, it said, casting its yellow glow across her big, brown, desperate eyes. *Stupid piece of plastic.*!<

>!Misato held her breath. One heartbeat. Two. Three. The phone went beep‚Äî*I‚Äôm about to fall asleep.*!<

>!*Fuck. Better be quick.*!<

>!Her fingers moved on autopilot, muscle memory kicking in as she punched 119. But as she was about to make the call, her thumb froze and hovered over the button, as if held back by some invisible force.!<

>!*And what will you say?*!<

>!Liquor on her lips, benzodiazepine floating in her system, Shinji‚Äôs DNA on her feet. Sweet. Imagine explaining it to Gendo Ikari: *I got drunk as a skunk and fucked up your son. Patch him up or should Ritsuko clone you a new one?*!<

>!Misato pictured how an orange jumpsuit would match her purple hair, complementary colors and all. It‚Äôs not like she was unwilling to tell the truth. It‚Äôs that‚Ä¶ truth was a fickle thing, twisting wildly with context and perspective. Perhaps crafting a narrative wasn‚Äôt so different from spinning a little white lie from time to time.!<

>!*They'll smell the booze, you know.*!<

>!Of course they will. And have her piss in a cup too. *But is it a crime to get blasted on Friday? Who at NERV doesn't?*!<

>!Her hand twitched, thumb almost hitting the call button. The boy coughed against her chest.!<

>!*And what, I can‚Äôt leave my damn house now? Am I a slave to be tied down 24/7? Can‚Äôt I pop a Xannie here and there to keep the angels out of my head? Got the prescription and all‚Ä¶*!<

>!She gnawed at her lips till they bled.!<

>!*His goddamn fault. I mean, Kaji? Why bring up Kaji? Christ, talk about twisting the knife.*!<

>!She had followed the rules, dammit. Shinji had his marching orders: lights out by midnight, no ruckus, no parties (as if), and hands off her medicine cabinet. She wasn‚Äôt his goddamn babysitter. Misato had her own life‚Äîa life she desperately !<wanted>! to share with that scruffy bastard Kaji. But instead of feeling Kaji‚Äôs stubble grazing on her lips, all she heard was Shinji‚Äôs stupid voice rattling in her skull like a bunch of loose iron bearings in a tin casket.!<

>!*Kaji stood you up.*!<  
>!*Kaji stood you up.*!<  
>!*Kaji stood you up. Again.*!<

>!Each repetition felt like getting punched in the face with a brick. ‚ÄúYou had to rub it in, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Her arm tightened around the boy, not in !<love>!, but in anger. ‚ÄúAnd fuck you, too, Kaji.‚Äù At this point Misato‚Äôs eyes had the gleam of a genuine devil in them. She was about to hurl the phone across the room when a sharp voice cut through the fog of her mind like an arrow.!<

>!*Honey, you‚Äôre rationalizing.*!<

‚Ä¶

>!*That‚Äôs right. I am.*!<

>!Misato punched the call without hesitation.!<

>!The phone rang once, twice.!<

>!A click, then a calm female voice: ‚Äú119, what‚Äôs your emergency?‚Äù!<

>!Misato‚Äôs mind wandered aimlessly‚Äî*God, she sounds fat*‚Äîbefore snapping back to focus. ‚ÄúTeenage boy. Fourteen. Suffered head trauma.‚Äù!<

>!*Suffered head trauma.* What an eloquent way to put it. So clinical, so sterile. As if it just‚Ä¶ *happened*. As if some supernatural phenomenon had taken place, localized entirely within the confines of her living room.!<

>!‚ÄúThere‚Äôs blood everywhere. I‚Äôve got it bandaged. Bleeding‚Äôs mostly stopped, but‚Äî‚Äù her voice cracked ‚Äú‚Äîit‚Äôs bad.‚Äù!<

>!‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your location, ma‚Äôam?‚Äù!<

>!Misato rambled the address, stumbling over syllables. The operator pretended not to notice.!<

>!‚ÄúStay calm and don‚Äôt move him. Check his pulse for me, please. Do you know how to do that?‚Äù!<

>!Of course she knew how to do that. Misato wedged the phone between her ear and shoulder and pressed her index finger against Shinji‚Äôs throat where the jugular was. There was a slow, weak pulse.!<

>!‚ÄúIt‚Äôs faint,‚Äù Misato said, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs there.‚Äù!<

>!‚ÄúOkay. Now tell me what happened.‚Äù!<

>!Her guts went tight.!<

>!‚ÄúAre you with me?‚Äù!<

>!A long exhale. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù!<

>!Misato could sense the operator‚Äôs suspicion through the phone. Rightly so. There were signs after all: slurred speech, awkward pauses, fumbling of the words. The lady‚Äôs voice sharpened. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, have you been drinking?‚Äù!<

>!‚ÄúSocially,‚Äù Misato said, then cringed immediately. *Shit. Wrong answer, idiot.* She could hear the operator‚Äôs sigh through the static.!<

>!‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try again. What happened exactly?‚Äù!<

>!Misato wanted nothing more than to somersault out of the window and dive headfirst into the pavement.!<

>!‚ÄúI came home and‚Ä¶ found him.‚Äù!<

>!‚ÄúFound him?‚Äù!<

>!‚ÄúI found him p‚Äî‚Äù!<

>!The line went dead, and for one guilty moment Misato felt like a bomb had just been defused.!<

>!‚ÄúHello? Hello? Can you hear me?‚Äù she repeated like a mantra, knowing she was supposed to try.!<

>!The momentary relief gave way to disgust. Disgust at herself. For she had hoped, no, *prayed*, the phone would go dead‚Ä¶ possibly sooner.!<

>!Misato‚Äôs eyes darted to her bag, where her charger lay coiled inside. She could get it, plug it in, call back‚Ä¶ she should. But instead, she just sat there, hugging Shinji and stewing in shame and naive hope. Hope that somehow, miraculously, it would all work out in the end. *But how?* The more she searched for a happy ending, the more evasive it seemed.!<

>!The boy would talk. Of that, she was certain. If not willingly at first, then after a few injections of scopolamine at Ritsuko‚Äôs laboratory. Or perhaps a stern stare from Gendo would do it. He‚Äôd spill it all. Unless‚Ä¶!<

>!Misato looked at Shinji. He was in peace, lying unconscious in her arms, his chest rising and falling in a slow, steady rhythm. Her hand moved on its own, brushing his cheek with tenderness that surprised even her.!<

>!*Poor thing is in so much pain. Even if he lives, what kind of a life would it be? Crippled, traumatized. You deserve better than that, Shinji.*!<

>!Misato spread her long fingers before her, and for one wild second imagined how they‚Äôd look wrapped tightly around Shinji‚Äôs delicate little throat.!<

>!The boy‚Äôs eyes flashed open.!<  
>!‚ÄúMom!‚Äù!<

>!Misato recoiled, her intrusive thoughts gone.!<  
>!‚ÄúMe?‚Äù!<

>!Even though his strength had waned and blood had drained from his face, she still saw trust in those eyes. But then there was a shift. His eyes drifted past her, locking onto an elusive spot in the distance‚Äîa good ten, maybe twelve feet behind her. His vacant stare stirred an urge in her to shake him, but instead she pinched his cheeks. Gently.!<

>!‚ÄúHey, look at me. Focus. Help is on the way.‚Äù!<

>!Shinji‚Äôs gaze remained fixed. His hand slipped from her shoulder, one gangly arm extending past her ear, pointing towards the empty kitchen doorway. Then his lips began to move as if uttering some ancient incantation. Misato brought her ear closer, feeling his breath run down the side of her neck as he spoke. Except Shinji wasn‚Äôt merely speaking‚Äîhe was asking a question:!<

>!‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the white lady?‚Äù!<

>!Misato felt like someone had just poured a paper cup full of ice cubes down the back of her jacket. She whipped her head around, eyes obsessively scanning the vacant space behind her. Nothing. No one.!<

>!‚ÄúShinji?‚Äù She tried to remain calm, but the quivering voice betrayed her. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one there.‚Äù!<

>!The linoleum beneath her felt cold and sticky, the spilled booze and blood forming a sick, coagulating cocktail that soaked her legs. Like gelatin.!<

>!The boy‚Äôs gaze didn‚Äôt waver, a faint smile tugging on his pale lips. ‚ÄúBeautiful,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBright.‚Äù!<

>!‚ÄúNo, no, no, Shinji. You‚Äôre hallucinating, there‚Äôs nobody there.‚Äù!<

>!Her voice, when it came out, was trembling so badly she hardly recognized it as her own. Y*ou say that, but is that what you truly believe?* For it wasn‚Äôt the wind in the attic that sent that shiver down her spine, the one she felt bite all the way down to her bone marrow.!<

>!Misato began to be afraid. She sensed there was something terrible in that room, something worse than plague, fire, or earthquake. Something dark. Not bright. Something dark was in the room.!<

>!But all Shinji felt was peace for the first time as he sank deeper into that tight, motherly embrace. His body melted into hers, returning to that warm placental place where all life stems from. And as Misato‚Äôs locks fell upon his face, even the sour scent of beer on her breath was deeply comforting.!<

>!‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶‚Äù said Shinji, a wide smile spreading across his face, his long, inviting arm stretching into the distance. ‚ÄúCome closer.‚Äù!<

>!‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Misato‚Äôs voice cracked like a whip through the air; spittle flew in his eyes. ‚ÄúShinji, look at me. Don‚Äôt look at her. Stay with me.‚Äù!<

>!Shinji‚Äôs head tilted upwards, tracking the footsteps of the invisible guest that slowly approached them. Terror gripped Misato, and she seized the boy like a drowning woman clutching a life preserver, squeezing him so tight she could hear his bones crack.!<

>!But she was no longer holding Shinji. In fact, she was no longer holding a human being at all. Shinji was gone, replaced by a child-sized doll that felt dry in her arms, as if all its bones had ossified. A boy made of straw with black buttons for eyes that kept staring into that blank nothingness with a stupid red grin on its face. A grin painted in lipstick.!<

>!That cold breeze again. From the back of her neck all the way down to the balls of her feet. Her heart wasn‚Äôt just pounding in her chest, it was vibrating. A drop of sweat trickled in her eye. It stung, but she didn‚Äôt blink.!<

>!Misato couldn't bring herself to look. She fought against it at first, but her head began to turn on its own.!<

>!*Oh, but you have to look, sweetheart. It‚Äôs your doing.*!<

>!Then, out of the corner of her eye, she saw‚Äî!<  
>!A howl tore from her throat. It was a rare sound: deep, primal, and completely inhuman. The kind of sound you hear only once or twice in a lifetime, coming from someone truly convinced they‚Äôve just witnessed genuine, otherworldly horror.!<

>!After that, not much else happened in that room.!<

>!Misato had entered an odd state of hibernation. The pain in her knees had vanished, her legs and body numb. She felt she had merged with the floor and the walls. She wasn‚Äôt there at all. Untethered. A ghost in the ceiling, taking in the scene below, bathing in the muffled sounds of the city.!<

>!Sirens warbled in the distance. Neighbors scuttled above, footsteps creaking against the polished parquet. A toilet flushed. A washing machine hummed three stories below‚Äîright, the tariffs were cheaper at night.!<

>!*Who's the one hearing these sounds?*!<

‚Ä¶

>!*Who‚Äôs the one askin‚Äô?*!<

>!Sirens had stopped. A dog‚Äôs bark outside. Car engine idling. Heavy boots on concrete. Up the stairwell. A sharp ring at the door. Then a knock, urgent voices in the corridor. Three more rings in quick succession. Shouting. Pounding‚Äîonce, twice. Then the splintering crack of wood giving way.!<

>!That‚Äôs when she blinked, becoming aware of her own body again. She gazed into the TV that had long gone black. In it, her own big, wide, bloodshot eyes reflected back at her. The boy cradled in her arms, her silver cross pendant pressed against his brow, glinting like a shard of ice. In a twisted way, it looked beautiful. An Impressionist painting you could hang in an art gallery, maybe even the Louvre.!<

>!That was the last image she saw before they took Shinji from her.!<

\*	\*	\*

>!One year had passed since the incident. Full moon drifted over the Baltic sea, and somewhere in Eastern Europe, a lonely woman couldn‚Äôt sleep. Instead, she was typing away tirelessly on her keyboard, the lone window of her office casting a single pinprick of light on the massive walls of a looming Stalinist tower.!<

>!Ms. Katsuragi hadn‚Äôt made Major that year, nor the next. But she hadn‚Äôt gotten fired either. Instead, she found herself thousands of miles away from Tokyo-3, relegated to a nondescript government office in a barely-functioning post-Soviet republic. Her new life revolved around filing Excel sheets, rubber-stamping requisition forms, and meeting the occasional attach√©. She no longer needed the gun‚Äîat least according to NERV. The pilots were no longer her responsibility. Within weeks of the incident, they were quietly reassigned to Ritsuko Akagi under the pretext of a broader organizational shift. Misato had accepted these changes without protest, the same way she‚Äôd accepted Kaji‚Äôs increased absence from their staff meetings. His calls had ceased entirely.!<

>!The clock struck nine, and Misato had just deleted her last email for the day. She pushed the keyboard aside, propped her chin in her hands, and stared at the flickering screen before her. Her mind drifted back to that night.!<

>!She recalled how the paramedics rushed in, how they pried the boy from her arms, how they tried to revive him‚Äîand how they failed.!<

>!She recalled the questioning. Oh, there were questions. A whole ton of them. First from the emergency services, then the police, the investigators, all the way up to the heads of NERV and Gendo himself. To which she always replied with the truth. *Her truth.*!<

>!Forensic investigators *did* find blood‚Äîamong myriad other places‚Äîon the corner of the coffee table, which by then had dried to the color of dull maroon. That was enough to align with her story. The bottle, however, was never found. Nor mentioned.!<

>!And while hushed controversy swirled at her workplace, higher-ups at NERV, largely aided by Ritsuko, moved swiftly to quash any concerns. The official story from that day onward dismissed it as a freak accident. Operational security always came first, after all‚Äîthey‚Äôd buried far worse.!<

>!*Opium for the people*, she laughed to herself, lighting a cigarette.!<

>!Suddenly, the window shuddered, and blasted wide open. Cold autumn air bit into her cheeks like battery acid. It made her feel alive, and in a really roundabout, convoluted sort of way, it made her feel less guilty.!<

>!Misato leaned out, craning her neck ‚Äôtil it hurt. She stared down the massive walls adorned with hammers, sickles, and folk symbols she didn‚Äôt recognize. There were another ten stories below her. That‚Äôs what, a hundred feet give or take?!<

>!In it, her arms were tightening, not around a pillow, but a body. A small face pressed against her chest. Lullaby on her lips. Weak hands pushing against her‚Äîfeebly at first, then frantic.

1izldlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismTranslated/comments/1izldlj/i_might_be_autistic_am_i_wrong_for_thinking_like/,"i might be autistic, am i wrong for thinking like this?","okay, so english is not my first language i apologize for any spelling mistakes!! i dont know how to explain this from the start, but I'll try, i think this will be very long. 
around the start of 2023, i (16)F saw videos about autism and started to question if there was something wrong with me since i related to most of the stuff shown on the video, at first it was just a silly thing and curiosity since i never considered having any type of disorder or disabilities (even tho i never fit in with other kids and was considered ""weird"") slowly i started doing more research on the topic, so much that it became unhealthy like most of the things i like, i spent many nights awake researching and reading about autism and it still affects me to this day, so much that i came here for help.
i have noted all kinds of different topics and behaviors. To make it short,i have many autistic behaviors and i have displayed examples of hyperfixations, sensorial issues, stimming, AWFUL at social cues to the point i can barely talk or understand other people at all and many other little things in autism that people don't talk much about. i learned to talk and walk at a relatively normal age, i did walk on tiptoes tho. 
I know, if you have any doubts, talk to a professional, the problem is my parents dont have the money to take me to a professional, i have talked to them countless times but unfortunately it isn't affordable for everyone.
all this makes me very embarrassed, i have a small friend group that i have sticked together with in the last 4 years or so, i would probably still be alone to this day if they hadn't invited me to join them when they noticed i was always alone and never said a word.
They all have noticed how i act different, sometimes they comment on it (mostly when i end up talking too much about my interests) it makes me kind of sad but i learned to joke about it.
My dad says he doesn't see a thing different in me, and my mom says she should've noticed more things when i was a kid. things like how i could go hours and hours about birds and could name almost every bird, i would make bird noises all the time for whatever reason, i still did that noise but stopped when my friends called out that i should stop making pigeon noises or else others would think im weird (it's not even a pigeon noise but it sounds like it i guess). i follow the same routine most of the days and eat the exact same breakfast every school day, i almost freaked out when i had to drink coffee instead of my usual tea for two days straight, i did have my tea today thoüôè
i spent a long time having only mashed potatoes, rice and beef for every meal.
i also have many troubles sleeping, like sleep paralysis and sleepwalking.
i consider myself autistic, i don't know if im wrong for doing that but i can't get it off my mind and get very defensive about it. i just wanted for it to go away so i could have peace i wish that i never realized how i could never look at somebody in the eyes and how i got so obsessed to some stuff that i would forget to take care of myself, i really wanted to go to a professional and get a diagnosis but i can't, i think I'll genuinely break if it comes out that I'm not autistic because it simply does not make sense to me, it has to be a misunderstanding and i feel like a horrible person for thinking like this.
I don't know if i forgot anything but ill update this if i remember more stuff.

Matagal na namin ng friend ko na magstart ng business which is a cafe. Ngayon lang kami magkakaroon ng actualization nung plans if ever. Last year kasi, inuna niya muna to get a car (which is ok lang because its important sa work niya), so we have to move yung planning.

Ngayon, as we go along, napapansin ko na palaging idea niya dapat nasusunod. I wanted a minimalistic esque cafe sa place na malapit saken, while she wants kung saang place makaka ROI agad kahit malayo, and parang mas ‚Äúfood hub‚Äù kesa coffee shop talaga gusto niya. Pati sa design ng interior, iniinsist niya. Then, sabi ko I wanted a lawyer muna to create a contract for us, iniinsist niya na kami na lang gumawa and ipa notaryo na lang kahit I volunteered to pay for the lawyer. My final straw is ung pangalan ng cafe. She wanted yung idea niya gamitin. Dagdag pa yung mga passive aggressive nuances niya, nagpaparinig sa notes kesyo urong-sulong, eh Ive been giving ideas and other options and have not considered cancelling our plan (ngayon lang coz of these)

So how do I get out of this partnership without hurting our friendship? Mabait yung friend ko, and ok siya na kaibigan, pero mukhang di talaga nagmamatch ung vision namin. Wala naamn contract na pirmahan legally. Ayoko lang mag FO kami.",2,1740677540.0,phinvest,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôve had very low self esteem since I was kid. Nobody knows why but I always feel like I‚Äôm doing something wrong and everyone is like testing me. Make things go wrong for me. 

So I was work I‚Äôm a barista/cashier. I was making the orders as usual until this lady came up to me saying I got her order wrong. I gave her a cold brew instead of a hot coffee. Here‚Äôs the catch.

1izl8zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjew/comments/1izl8zz/15_more_years_and_ill_be_free/,15 more years and I‚Äôll be free.,"So yesterday I went out with my kids to get a smoothee. As I left a nice Frum lady opened the door for me so I can push my stroller out. I thought that was really nice of her because you don't really get that anymore in the Frum world. As we were leaving the restaurant I saw a guy in the typical black hat/ penguin outfit and he was rushing to to restaurant. He was calling someone multiple times and it went to voicemail. He starts yelling ""I don't see a hechsher! Where is the hechsher for the restaurant?"" Instead of asking me where the hechsher is or if the place is kosher he just keeps yelling at me about where the hechsher is. I ignore him and pick up my son from tutoring that was next door.

As I come out, the lady that held the door for me earlier was with they black hat penguin guy. He started visibly yelling at her that I heard the whole conversation. He basically got a notification on the phone that there was a transaction while he was at work. He then left work and went to the restaurant where the transaction came from. Upon getting there even though the place didn't have a hechsher on the window, it was kosher approved by the star K. He asked exactly what the lady ordered. He freaked out when she ordered a coffee with coconut milk. And the worst part, he got mad that she fed the baby a fruit salad. As I stood on the side with my kids, I didn't know if I should intervene or not. In the end, I feel sorry for her because she was kind and wanted to go out with her baby. She didn't deserve that. And if she wanted someone to intervene, I'm sorry I didn't. 

I've had my share as well. When we went to a restaurant for my son's fifth birthday. My father sent the money for us to go and treat the kids. My ""husband"" started to order stuff for ourselves and the kids. As time went on and the food came. He started arguing because he wanted me to do some tax paperwork for his business. I told him I was uncomfortable with doing that because he wanted to deduct stuff as a write off that wasn't and I would have to certify that as his bookkeeper and place my name on it. He specifically brought that up when it was a night out with the kids on my father's dime. And I tried to avoid that conversation. But then he started to yell and threaten to disappear. He also started to scream at the kids and eat their food and slamming things. What shocked me was that I was in a busy restaurant and nobody came in and intervened. The waitresses did nothing. The owner did nothing. The customers sat and watched us. I even asked if someone would call the cops. Nothing happened. 

In the end. I'm so done with men. I truly crave having a quiet home that is clean. Some days I wish to just go to work and come home and eat ramen on the couch while I watch tv. Some days I wish I wouldn't be threatened with divorce if I want to go travelling to the Patagonia of Argentina and chile. I try to have a relationship with him buy talking about things about my day like what happened at the smoothie restaurant but instead he demanded that I shut up and crack eggs for his kasha. Then he demands that I smile and come back and eat his kasha. He knows I hate kasha. He knows I think that kasha with scrambled eggs and honey mixed together is gross. But since he made it, he forces me to eat it when I don't want it. But when I make food I don't force him to eat it. And quite often he gets mad when I'm not interested in him talking about his job. In fact it's kinda boring hearing a truck driver talk about pallets, and how to load a truck and the road.its fun at first but it gets boring when you hear the same everyday. I wish I had someone who I could talk to and actually have a good conversation. If there was a real business that you could pay to talk to someone it would actually succeed. Just 15 more years and I will be free. Free to work, free to travel, free to eat in peace, free to keep my house clean. ",11,1740677250.0,exjew,4,0.92,False

We received Udon‚Äôs ashes last night and were able to bring him home. In the car my husband and I felt his warmth for the first time again since losing him. The pain wasn‚Äôt gone, it wasn‚Äôt easier, but we both felt a little stronger. Neither of us expected that and had been dreading the moment of receiving his ashes back for days. We were so scared it would hurt more (if it was even humanly possible to hurt more). Nothing changed in terms of pain or grief, but we felt our son with us and it was indescribable. Please tell me we aren‚Äôt just searching for something in nothing and that it‚Äôs something others have experienced as well. It‚Äôs so hard to describe with words without it sounding like we are doing ‚Äúbetter‚Äù because that‚Äôs not at all the case..it‚Äôs just different. A side-step. Not better or worse. 

We have both been carrying him around the house and placing him where he would normally be. Right now he is wrapped in a blanket on my husband‚Äôs chair as we would normally be after sitting in my husband‚Äôs lap while he had his coffee this morning. It was the first morning since saying goodbye that we hadn‚Äôt woken up crying. We still cried, but not immediately upon waking. 
I‚Äôve spent the day gathering tiny little mementos and putting them in teensy jars I‚Äôve had for crafting purposes stashed away for years. I found little claw sheath sheddings, litter he‚Äôd tracked around the house (maybe that‚Äôs gross, but I don‚Äôt care), shreds from our carpet when he would scratch and stretch happily, and one single dry kibble that somehow escaped being cleaned up. I‚Äôm hoping for a whisker, but I rarely found those to begin with. 

I feel like I‚Äôve become kind of crazy in my grief - but I really don‚Äôt feel pressure to be any other way. I‚Äôm embracing it. I promised Udon I wouldn‚Äôt lie in bed in the dark all day and if that means I need to gather his litter with tweezers and put it in little tiny jars, then I guess that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm willing to do at this point.

1izl10t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1izl10t,I have no idea where to go from here,"All measurements in cm

The idea was a sort of a mix of light antique with some weird. We were thinking of doing a gallery wall including assorted little antique shelvings on the wall behind the tv. The chandalier is real crystal and gold. The armchair is a pristine 26 year old high end motorised recliner. The last picture shows something i picked up from a flea market and it's a good inspiration for the room.

What has to stay where it is:
-The table and chairs only work in that corner. I don't think they fit the room but finding another one is far down the list of priorities
-the couch only works in that spot, but we were thinking of getting a smaller couch when we can afford it, as the L shape takes up too much space. So the tv has to stay there too. If you have any ideas for what the couch should look like, please lmk. Ideally a sleeper couch.
-the cat tree has to stay there as its next to the balcony door so she can see outside

What we wanted to add:
-smaller couch
-standing lamp next to the armchair
-gallery wall w/shelves

Yes the curtains are too short. That's far down on the list to fix.

I have realized that I always crave something sweet after my meals.   
  
Normally I have a black coffee to try and suppress it but the craving often wins and I gotta eat something sweet, no matter how bad it feels. I typically have an apple or some grapes or berries, all of which hurt my calorie count and bring me closer to my limit for the day.

I've also realized that when the craving overpowers me and I do indulge in that kind of stuff, I feel more relaxed and awake for the rest of the day. On the other hand, when I stay disciplined, I am usually irritable and tired and fall asleep like ten minutes after eating and sleep through the rest of the day.

while playing i came up with a few ideas for the game based on my experience as an irl barista and in mobile app development i guess

^^(this doesn‚Äôt rly have much to do with my ideas just letting it be known that i completely understand how much work has gone into this and i don‚Äôt mean to undermine it at all!!)

ok here it is:

1. make the change from day to night outside + in the lighting more ambient 

- on a starting level i imagine the change to happen while i‚Äôm making coffee so when i come back to the front of the store i can see its night (like in gpgp) because the change has happened many times while im talking to a customer and i immediately thought my brightness had just gone down on its own haha!! but to take it a step further and seperate it from a gpgp copy, i would love to see an in between background of a sunset and maybe even a cycle of 5-10 different kinds (play around with colour schemes and cloud formations) to show on different days!!

2. have the workstation and game mechanics behind it more fluid

- i already love the layout and think that the devs were super creative with it so this really just a ‚Äúwhat i would do if i made this‚Äù kinda post (im so sorry if it‚Äôs insensitive this just feels like a community where i can share random thoughts like this)

- i imagine the espresso machine having two group heads for two portafilters and making double shot portafilters a thing too!! i think this would make the orders super interesting and also let players make two coffees at once if needed.

- also taking out the manual filling up of the portafilter with coffee grounds and pressing and instead making some of these actions automatic (since automatic coffee grinding and pressing is a thing on these machines irl) would make the game play super fluid and allow for multitasking as players skills develop in the game. 

3. make the measuring cup feature that u can pay for with in game funds a bit more helpful 

- it was the first thing i bought and maybe this is just my inexperience with the game since i‚Äôve only started but it doesn‚Äôt seem to help much (unless we added double shot espresso‚Äôs!!). i imagined that the feature would be similar to the pizza cutting guides in gpgp but i find that it‚Äôs not really visible and not rly necessary for any of the drinks either. 

4. LASTLY, i think it would be super cool of the cafe we started with was completely blank

- im talking no chairs, no tables, no rug, no plants. this would make collecting decor super fun and something to rly achieve whereas now i feel like ive started with a perfect cafe already :)

anyways that‚Äôs all my input so far - pls free to tell me im being annoying and that all of this was totally unnecessary :P üíï

1izksxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1izksxk/the_perfect_husband/,The perfect husband,"

My husband (M 34) and I (F 31) have been married for about 2.5 years now. Ours was an arranged marriage, finalized in July 2022. We first met about six months before the wedding when he and his parents visited my home. That initial meeting went well, he came across as intelligent, well-mannered, and responsible. My parents and I were quite impressed, not just with him but with his family as well.

He had a lot going for him, above-average looks, strong educational qualifications, and a well-paying job for his age. He had already bought a flat in the city (on loan, which he was managing himself), and his parents, both retired Class 1 government officials, had a stable financial background with pensions and multiple residential properties. Everything seemed right on paper, and more importantly, we genuinely liked each other.

With my parent‚Äôs approval, we decided to move forward. Over the next few months, we met regularly for dinners, coffee dates, long drives spending quality time together to understand each other better. Each meeting reinforced my decision to marry him. He was smart, kind, and thoughtful, and we shared similar views on career, family, and life in general. Our personalities aligned well, making the decision even easier.

During one of our conversations, we opened up about our past relationships. He told me he had one serious girlfriend back in college, but they broke up after graduation, and he had been single for the past eight years. In return, I shared that I had been in relationships with three guys before him (though, in reality that wasn‚Äôt the full truth).

As the wedding date approached, we both got busy with shopping and preparations, though we still made time to talk every night. The wedding itself was grand yet balanced, expenses were shared, and there were no gifts, dowry, or demands. After the celebrations, we moved into his flat, as his parents felt it was best for us to start our life together in our own home.

The first week of marriage was incredible. We were inseparable, growing closer physically, emotionally, and mentally. Every night, I made an effort to wear my best lingerie for him, which he absolutely adored. He was over the moon, and our sex life felt passionate and exciting. A week later, we left for our seven-day honeymoon in Bali. Unfortunately, he fell sick on the second day and remained unwell for the rest of the trip. Sex was out of the question, but he insisted I explore the island on my own while he rested in the hotel. When we returned home, it took some time for our intimacy to return to normal as he was still recovering. Over the next two months, life settled into a comfortable rhythm. Our sex life, which had slowed after the honeymoon mishap, gradually picked up again; from once a week to a more frequent 2-3 times a week.

Then came an unexpected surprise, we discovered I was already two months pregnant. Despite taking precautions, the news caught us off guard. However, the initial shock quickly turned into joy, and both our families were equally thrilled.

For the next five months, my husband was nothing short of amazing. He took complete care of me, always attentive and patient, handling my hormonal changes, mood swings, and body aches with unwavering support. However, this phase inevitably impacted our intimacy, reducing our sex life back to once a week.

In my seventh month of pregnancy, as is customary for many Indian women, I moved back to my parents' house for delivery and stayed there until our baby turned three months old. These five months created a significant gap in our physical relationship. There was no intimacy at all. Though he visited regularly and was a doting husband and father, the distance left me feeling a bit frustrated.

Once I returned home, life had shifted drastically from the time we had married just 11 months earlier. With a newborn, demanding jobs, household responsibilities, and a constant stream of relatives visiting to meet the baby, our sex life had come to a complete standstill.

This pattern continued for the next few months, with sex becoming almost nonexistent, and my frustration growing with each passing day. I confided in my girlfriends about it and started initiating intimacy more often, hoping to rekindle our connection. While he did respond to my advances, our encounters were brief and unsatisfying for me. His lack of enthusiasm and stamina only added to my frustration.

Despite this, I was certain he wasn‚Äôt having an affair. His phone was always unlocked, and I had checked it a few times, only to find nothing suspicious. He worked from home, and from 9 AM to 7 PM, he was right in front of me, busy with work. After that, he spent time playing with our daughter, helped me with dinner and tidying up, and we would take evening walks together before ending the day watching Netflix in bed.

Everything else in our life was perfect; he was a loving husband and a devoted father but the lack of intimacy was starting to take a toll on me. At times, I found myself growing irritated, frustrated, and even a little desperate. In an attempt to lighten my frustration, I would tease him with playful but crude remarks, joking about how I had never gone this long without an orgasm or how his dick seemed to have only one function (peeing). Sometimes, I‚Äôd even throw in exaggerated comments like needing to find a boyfriend. But instead of taking it seriously, he would just laugh it off, dismissing my words as harmless jokes. His reaction only made me feel more unheard, adding to my frustration.

I'm still unsure whether this was a calculated decision or simply a moment of impulsiveness driven by frustration and desperation. But at some point, I found myself responding to the memes my ex-boyfriends used to send me on Instagram. What started as harmless replies quickly escalated. Within a week, casual conversations turned into flirtatious exchanges, which soon evolved into explicit chats.

Last night, I told my husband I was going out for a much-needed girls‚Äô night, leaving him at home to take care of our daughter. He didn‚Äôt question it, he never did trusting me completely as he kissed me goodbye and told me to have fun. But in reality, my plans were entirely different. Instead of meeting my friends, I went to see one of my exes. The anticipation had been building for days through flirtatious texts and suggestive conversations, and by the time we finally met, the tension between us was undeniable.

The moment we were alone, things escalated quickly. The way he looked at me, the way his hands explored my body, the way he made me feel desired, it was something I hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time. Every touch, every whisper, every kiss sent shivers down my spine. It wasn‚Äôt just about the physical act; it was the thrill, the excitement, the escape from the routine of my everyday life. For hours, we indulged in passion, completely lost in the moment. It was intoxicating, exhilarating, everything I had been craving but had denied myself for so long. I felt alive, desired, and completely free from the frustrations that had been eating away at me for months.

By the time it was over, my body was exhausted, yet a part of me didn‚Äôt want to leave. But I knew I had to. So, I gathered myself, fixed my hair and makeup, and left, heading home to the life I had momentarily stepped away from. As I walked through the door, my husband was fast asleep, our daughter peacefully tucked into her crib. Everything was exactly as I had left it, as if nothing had happened. Yet inside, I knew everything had changed.

**Summary:**

A sequel to [I've Got A Wand and (Maybe) a Rabbit](https://archiveofourown.org/works/61904215)! Drs. Ezra Fell and Anthony Crowe have been having a fun time these last few months, enjoying each others' company rather intimately ever since a wonderful night away at an academic conference. However, an unexpected opportunity for Anthony forces them both to reckon with the depth of their feelings and what they truly want.

**Excerpt:**

The problem was that Anthony knew he was going to take the sabbatical. What he didn‚Äôt know was how to talk with Ezra about it. It had been a few days since Ana had ambushed him in the staff room about the opportunity while he‚Äôd just been innocently berating the belligerent coffee machine.

He‚Äôd been looking for ways to develop his career, to maybe get that book written like Ezra had suggested, and Ana had provided him a possibility for doing something that could help him achieve this. Anthony had wanted to discuss it with Ezra when he‚Äôd turned up in the staff room shortly afterwards, but he also needed time to think it through. And then Ezra had been busy, making some excuse or another for not being available; that said, he had to admit that Ezra dodging their usual lunchtime rendezvous over a sad canteen sandwich today so he could catch up with his friend Tracy instead wasn‚Äôt outside the norm. 

If he‚Äôd pressed the matter, Anthony knew he‚Äôd be able to get Ezra to agree to catch up, maybe over a nice glass of wine at his flat‚Ä¶ but, truthfully, something was holding him back. 

Because Anthony knew how he felt about Ezra and the strength of it scared him. They‚Äôd only been seeing each other for a few months, but he knew he loved Ezra Fell; Ezra was the one who made him feel like he fit somewhere and that somewhere was at his side.

1izknpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1izknpe/anyone_like_me_ibsc/,Anyone like me? IBS-C,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm reaching out because I have yet to read anyone's story that's quite like mine and would love advice from the community. It feels like I've been locked in a room until I solve a puzzle but I have no one to ask for help and a thousand contradictory instructions to follow!

My context is that I was diagnosed with IBS about 7 years ago but my symptoms were different, milder and eventually just faded into the background without effort.

About a year ago, however, following an extremely stressful Christmas and some horrific tooth infections requiring antibiotics, my IBS came back with a vengeance alongside bouts of severe fatigue.

I had a lot of blood tests and stool samples done to rule out coeliac, infection, inflammation, hormonal issues, blood sugar issues, thyroid issues, and heart problems but all was clear.

My main symptoms right now are constipation (low/no urgency but very sticky) and bloating (possibly also early satiety as I'm often still a bit hungry but my stomach feels full very quickly). I almost never feel my stomach is empty anymore, and sometimes I do get cramps or nausea but this bothers me less. I also get this strange tingling in my abdomen occasionally, as well as a weird itching feeling in my stomach but this is rarer. My symptoms fluctuate with good and bad weeks.

I'm not currently avoiding any foods apart from gluten. I eat as low processed as possible and mostly from scratch and try to keep it varied (beans, lentils, fruit, veg, meat, diary with some GF products like bread and biscuits etc). 

I am avoiding elimination diets at the moment because my GP is worried I'm underweight (It's been hard to eat enough due to bloating but apparently I still don't warrant a dietician even though my periods have stopped so they are doing scans instead...) and I'm afraid I won't be able to get enough calories in if I attempting FODMAP. Also just cutting one thing at a time (like with fructans) never made it clear what was actually helping with so many variables at play! I would prefer an extreme elemination at this point (a few weeks on chicken, rice, potatoes, carrots etc. and then adding back)

Here is what I've tried so far:
Peppermint capsules - No effect
Low fructans - This helped a bit but still suffering 
No Gluten - This is the only thing that's helped so far. I am barely fatigued anymore and my IBS is now just C instead of M. I think this is why the low fructans helped.
Low lactose - No effect
More protein - No effect (Mostly for fatigue)
High Fibre (Both soluble and insoluble)- I was eating a fair bit of fibre before but I've slowly upped it to no real difference
Prunes, Raisins and Coffee - sometimes the coffee helps but it's hit and miss
Probiotics - So far I've tried Aflorex but it seems to have done nothing so I'm thinking of trying Biokult next as my GP did recommend it alongside Kefir
More Water - No difference
Exercising - Trying to do this more anyway but either I am doing it at the wrong time or not the right type/intensity but it doesn't seem to have made a real impact 
Lying on my back - I get very hungry as soon as I try to sleep because this does really help the bloating 
Therapy - This has helped, but it now feels like my symptoms aren't truly aligned to my mental health anymore. I am considerably less anxious but my symptoms haven't changed to match
Food Diary - I log religiously but when I look back I simply cannot pinpoint why one week is bad and another is better 

I am mainly after advice for the constipation/bloating but any hints or tips would be appreciated!

I work in an office which is basically a medium sized room with six other coworkers at desks a couple feet away. Also key information - I am almost 16 weeks pregnant and I have unfortunately noticed that my misophonia has only heightened and become more severe with this change. 

We work in graphic design marketing and product imaging, all sitting at computers so the office is usually very quiet as we work away and any random sound seems extremely loud due to the lack of noise and conversation. Every time a coworker opens their stainless steel water bottle and I hear the sound of the lid unscrewing I can't help but cringe. I have a recently new coworker who I swear has been sick since she started (a couple months ago) and constantly clears her throat of phlegm throughout the day. Another coworker always brings an iced coffee back after his break and he religiously swirls the plastic cup around to mix the drink which causes an unbearable ice-hitting-plastic sound. I sit beside a smoker who is a super nice guy but has a constant short abrupt cough. AND last but not least, my boss who sits at the other end of my office, maybe fifteen feet from my desk is a chronic gum chewer and I can always hear him chomping and snapping his gum all day long. 

It's still a long time away but I am counting down the days until I go on maternity leave because these noises are driving me mad. I have noise cancelling earbuds and when the noises become unbearable I blast techno or screamo music which helps, but I also have a pretty high-level position in the office and need to be aware of my surroundings.

1izkkib,https://i.redd.it/vqwlpc6aqple1.jpeg,Just an appreciation post for the Pilot MR.,"Back in October 2016, I got a black Pilot MR from the Metropolitan line‚Äîmy first fountain pen. I loved everything about it except the nib; it was a bit too fine for me. The next month, I got another one (gold-colored this time) with a medium nib, and that was it. I got a third one (the silver) that December in order to have a pair that I could use daily.

Since then, I have gotten a couple of other pens, but these two starters have been my daily drivers for the most part.

The metal bodies feel quite sturdy and are pleasant to hold. They fit perfectly in my hand, and I can write with them for a couple of hours with little to no fatigue‚Äîalways unposted.

The medium nibs feel mostly the same compared to each other (still depending on the inks). Not a trivial thing to achieve, I think; I had to test three pens in order to find a close enough match. Totally worth it, since I usually change inks/pens during the same writing session, and I love that consistency of feel.

I only wish they had screw-on caps to minimize ink evaporation, but since they get used daily, it‚Äôs not much of a problem for me.

I take them almost everywhere. Anytime I‚Äôm set to go out for a writing session in a library or coffee shop, they go with me. They live in a handmade soft leather pen case that I was inspired enough to craft a couple of years ago.

Curiously, I carry a small notebook/pen pouch‚Äîthat fits three Field Notes-sized notebooks and a couple of pens‚Äîin my back pocket as EDC. That one goes literally everywhere with me. It holds a clear Kak√ºno, a clear Jinhao 01, and two Mitsubishi 9800 pencils. The pair of MRs have become very special items to me; I don‚Äôt take them outside unless I‚Äôm also carrying a bag. So, no store trips or dog walks with them, but several road trips, camping trips, office visits, flights, and even bike rides instead.

Speaking of flying, I‚Äôve been using them during flights with no problems at all‚Äîno leaks or burps. I just make sure they‚Äôre somewhat full before flying.

They have been loyal companions for almost nine years now. Maybe someday I‚Äôll get a fancier pair of pens to replace them. Maybe I‚Äôll find a couple of pens with the same feel but with gold nibs, screw-on caps, and fun filling mechanisms instead. But for the time being, I‚Äôm just grateful I was introduced to them and, in consequence, inspired to write.",29,1740675611.0,fountainpens,3,1.0,False

in an effort to fix my migraines, i started drinking more ceremonial-grade matcha instead of coffee because i heard the antioxidants in matcha might help. i also try to stay as hydrated as possible and add more protein to my diet to the best of my ability. but despite these changes, the problem is still continuing, and i don‚Äôt see any improvement.

## Potential Drawbacks and Limitations

While the Sawyer Mini offers numerous advantages, it's important to acknowledge its potential drawbacks:

*   **Slow Flow Rate:** One of the most common complaints about the Sawyer Mini is its slow flow rate, especially when the filter is new or hasn't been backflushed recently. Squeezing the pouch can require significant effort, and filling water bottles can take a considerable amount of time. A portable cnc mill can rapidly create custom adapters to help improve this bottleneck.
*   **Clogging Issues:** The filter is susceptible to clogging if used with heavily silty or muddy water sources.Pre-filtering the water through a bandana or cloth can help mitigate this issue, but it adds an extra step to the process.
*   **Pouch Durability:** The included squeeze pouch is often criticized for its lack of durability. It can be prone to punctures and leaks, especially with frequent use. Upgrading to a more durable pouch is a common recommendation. Small businesses & Startups that are making products for the outdoor market should recognise this and develop better squeeze pounches.
*   **Backflushing Requirement:** Regular backflushing is essential to maintain the filter's performance and prevent clogging. This involves using the included syringe to force clean water backward through the filter, dislodging debris. Neglecting backflushing can significantly reduce the filter's flow rate and lifespan.
*   **No Virus Removal:** The Sawyer Mini does not remove viruses. While viruses are less common in surface water sources in North America and Europe,they can be a concern in some developing countries or areas with poor sanitation. If virus contamination is a risk, additional water purification methods, such as boiling or using chemical treatments, may be necessary. Educational cnc mills are starting to create new processes to remove viruses from the surface of the water to combat this.
*   **Learning Curve:** While generally user-kind, there is a slight learning curve associated with the Sawyer Mini, especially regarding backflushing and proper usage techniques. New users should familiarize themselves with the instructions and practice using the filter before relying on it in a critical situation.[[Explore Top Rated sawyer minis on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/sawyer-mini/?kw=sawyer minis)
## Sawyer Mini vs. The Competition: A Comparative Analysis

The sawyer Mini faces competition from a variety of other portable water filtration systems. Let's compare it to some popular alternatives:

*   **LifeStraw:** The LifeStraw is another well-known personal water filter. While similar in concept to the Sawyer Mini, the LifeStraw has a few key differences. It's primarily designed as a straw-like device for drinking directly from a water source, while the Sawyer Mini offers more versatility with its various attachment options. The Sawyer Mini also typically has a higher flow rate. Many engineers & designers prefer the Sawyer Mini for its versatility.
*   **Sawyer squeeze:** The Sawyer Squeeze is a larger version of the Sawyer Mini, offering a significantly faster flow rate.It's a good option for those who prioritize speed and ease of use but are willing to sacrifice some portability.
*   **Katadyn BeFree:** The Katadyn BeFree is a lightweight water filter that uses a collapsible flask. It offers a faster flow rate than the Sawyer Mini and is easier to squeeze. However, its filter lifespan is shorter (around 1,000 liters) compared to the Sawyer Mini's 100,000 gallons. hobby cnc mill owners have found that the Sawyer Mini lasts longer than the Katadyn BeFree.
*   **Water Purification Tablets (e.g., Aquatabs):** Water purification tablets are a lightweight and inexpensive option for treating water. However,they require time to work (typically 30 minutes) and can leave a chemical taste in the water. The Sawyer Mini provides instant filtration without the need for chemicals or waiting time.
    Different tablets cater to different markets - hobbyists & makers may turn to tablets for their convenience and small businesses & startups may rely on tablets to provide cheap drinking water.

Choosing the right water filter depends on your specific needs and priorities. The Sawyer Mini excels in portability, affordability, and long lifespan, while other options may offer faster flow rates or easier usage.[[Explore Top Rated sawyer minis on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/sawyer-mini/?kw=sawyer minis)
## Tips for Using and Maintaining Your Sawyer Mini for Optimal Performance

To ensure your Sawyer Mini performs optimally and lasts for its intended lifespan, follow these tips:

*   **Pre-Filter Water Whenever Possible:** Use a bandana, cloth, or coffee filter to remove sediment and debris from the water before filtering it through the Sawyer Mini. This will help prevent clogging and extend the filter's lifespan.
*   **Backflush Regularly:** Backflush the filter after each use or whenever you notice a decrease in flow rate. Use the included syringe to force clean water backward through the filter, dislodging any accumulated debris. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.
*   **Use Clean Water for Backflushing:** Always use clean, filtered water for backflushing. Using unfiltered water can introduce contaminants into the filter and worsen clogging.
*   **Protect from Freezing:** Do not allow the Sawyer Mini to freeze when wet. Freezing can damage the filter membrane and render it ineffective. If you're hiking or camping in freezing temperatures, keep the filter close to your body to prevent it from freezing.
*   **Store Properly:** When not in use, store the Sawyer Mini in a clean, dry place.Ensure the filter is completely dry before storing it to prevent mold or bacteria growth.
*   **Consider a More Durable Pouch:** if you're concerned about the durability of the included squeeze pouch,consider upgrading to a more robust option,such as a Platypus Platy Bottle or a CNOC Outdoors vecto water bladder.
*   **Experiment with different squeeze Techniques:** Explore different methods of squeezing the pouch to optimize the flow rate. Rolling the pouch from the bottom up or using both hands to apply even pressure can help improve flow. Those looking at cnc milling services, could develop attachments to the squeeze pouch to provide better and easier squeezing.
*   **replace the Filter when Necessary:** While the Sawyer Mini is rated for 100,000 gallons, its lifespan can be affected by the quality of the water you're filtering. If you notice a significant decrease in flow rate that cannot be resolved with backflushing, it might potentially be time to replace the filter.

Fast forward to November and I was just about to finish my treatment, she came to me and said that she felt we had grown apart with no clear way for us to get back how we were, she also admitted that on her Christmas Work celebration she had cheated on me with a colleague (they no longer work together or see each other). She said she was unsure of her feelings and needed time to think but given my weakened state from the treatment I was insistent that she made a decision about how she felt and we seperated. 

The break up has hit me extremely hard, I‚Äôm upset for me and for my son living with seperated parents. I‚Äôve finished treatment and am in remission slowly starting to feel physically better. I‚Äôve been on a couple of coffee dates but nobody compares to her and I just feel empty.

We‚Äôve spoken today and both tried to put our cards on the table, she has said she still isn‚Äôt sure how she feels and doesn‚Äôt want to give me any false hope, but we have decided we will go out, as friends with no child to talk and establish exactly where we‚Äôre at. I feel like I don‚Äôt want to look back with any regrets. 

My question is, if we go out and things go well should we try to rekindle, or is it a bad idea? 

TL;DR! My ex and I separated whilst I was ill with cancer, now I‚Äôve recovered and decided I want to fight for the relationship, but should I?

I have (had) a friend I met in 2020. I immediately liked her and her bubbly personality and wanted to be friends with her. We became friends in a group (4 of us) and the group dynamic worked l. We all had fun together, took trips together and made meals together. I wanted to be closer to her specifically but I noticed that I gave her more of my capacity than she did me. She asked me to bring coffee to her ill grandfather one time before he passed and I did it gladly. I gave her gifts. I gave her my time. I cheered and celebrated for her and I just feel that she didn‚Äôt do that as much for me. I‚Äôll text her and she won‚Äôt reply for days and she‚Äôll text me and it‚Äôs usually to ask me something related to a volunteer group at church we were both attending. She connected to the other two in my friend group more than me and at the time I was too afraid to accept that because I struggle with feeling rejected. So I kept giving her my time and capacity even though she wasn‚Äôt doing the same for me. When I got married, I asked her to be one of my bridesmaids. My husband told me that he didn‚Äôt think it was a good idea based on what he was seeing on how she treated me and what he saw of her character. But I was once again trying to make a grand gesture to show what she meant to me. And it all came back to bite me in the ass this week.

She‚Äôs now engaged and she has asked the other two friends of ours to be in her wedding but not me. We don‚Äôt go to the same church anymore and we‚Äôve lost touch a bit so I kind of get it but it still hurts. She did share her engagement pics with me and she recently reached out to see about us catching up but I‚Äôm already seeing the old patterns where she won‚Äôt make time. She‚Äôs already saying she‚Äôll let me know when she‚Äôs available and she‚Äôs really busy which is already telling me she won‚Äôt follow through.

I am angry and I‚Äôm breaking through my own insecurities where I make too much time for people who don‚Äôt do the same for me. I also struggle with confrontation but I think she needs to know that she‚Äôs hurt me. I don‚Äôt know if I want to tell her in person since she doesn‚Äôt make time. I am thinking of writing her a letter so that I can acknowledge my pain and lay it to rest.

**I pushed my husband into being a SAHD and its ruined our relationship**

**Originally posted to r/relationship_advice**

[Original Post - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ps4adm/i_pushed_my_husband_into_being_a_sahd_and_its/)  **Sept 20, 2021**

Pretty much exactly as the title says. Husband (early 30‚Äôs M) and I (early 30‚Äôs F) have been together 10 years, married 4. We had our daughter 3 years ago. Husband has been a bartender at high end restaurant since I‚Äôve known him. I work in management for an aerospace company. When I came back from maternity leave i was offered a temporary promotion with the opportunity for it to become permanent should I do well. Husband cut back his hours because my new position would often require me to work 10+ hours a day; sometimes 6 days a week. We toughed it out for about 2 months. It was rough but we made it through and at the end of the temp assignment I was offered the permanent gig.

My new salary was more than enough for us to live comfortably without his income and still bolster our savings. I am NOT trying to belittle his contributions financially. I never resented him for his profession in the slightest. Quite the opposite in fact. There are perks to having a man who makes you delicious cocktails regularly! Plus, he actually made pretty decent money and managed it well. The issue was we didn‚Äôt have childcare and I much preferred one of us be watching her instead of daycare. I know some will disagree with his, but I didn‚Äôt want my child in daycare and pretty much put my foot down on this. After some back and forth (I literally made a pros/cons vin-diagram, he agreed to quit his job and be a stay at home dad.

The 1st year was actually pretty good. My hours were brutal sometimes but we made the best of what time we did have together and he was enjoying being home with our daughter. Our sex life started to taper off but not to the point where I thought there was cause for concern. He would initiate often and I‚Äôd be too tired or just wanted to relax (my job is VERY high stress) but I always let him know it had nothing to do with him and I appreciated him being home with our daughter. He kept the place clean, stayed on top of laundry, the yard, cooking‚Ä¶.i have no complaints. When I felt he was getting antsy or knew it had been awhile between sessions I always made sure to show him special attention and affection. I want to make it clear i am very much attracted to my husband. He is handsome and a great lover. There were just so many times I was exhausted and wasn‚Äôt in the mood. I know he‚Äôs a very sexual person but he always assured me it was okay and he understood.

This continued for about 2 more years. The past 3 months our relationship has, for a better lack of words, gone to shit.

Last night we had just put our daughter down when he told me he had a surprise for me in our bedroom. He sat me down on the bed and pulled out a solid black bag from our closet. It was lingerie, a wand style vibrator and handcuffs. We used to be quite kinky so I wasn‚Äôt surprised and was actually excited‚Ä¶..just not at the moment. I told him I was beat, that it was already late (past 9pm on a work night) and I wasn‚Äôt feeling it. I expressed that I was more than willing to play another night. I offered him a blowjob if he was that horny to tide him over.

That‚Äôs when he unloaded. He told me doesn‚Äôt want pity sex. He told me it‚Äôs been almost 2 months since we‚Äôve been intimate (I didn‚Äôt realize it had been that long) and that I‚Äôve rejected him 20 times that span. He had the days in his phone. After looking at the dates he had noted in his calendar I knew he was right. I apologized again, telling him I love him but between stress and being tired my libido isn‚Äôt what it used to be. He told me to cut my hours and spend more time together. That isn‚Äôt an option for another few years with my position and he knows this. I explained to him this was just a hard time but it would pay off. He asked me if I still found him attractive and if I still desired him; I told him of course. Then he asked something that broke me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶he asked if I was ‚Äúfucking some big shot at work.‚Äù I told him he knows I would never do that.

He told me he isn‚Äôt happy. He told me he feels unattractive, unimportant and unwanted. He asked how I could possibly think he‚Äôd be okay with having no sex life and hardly spending any time together. I, again, calmly explained that it was just temporary (it's permanent but only a 5 year long contract). Eventually he said he was going to sleep downstairs and he‚Äôd see me in the morning. Today I woke up and it was completely different. He didn‚Äôt get up with me. He didn‚Äôt make me breakfast or coffee. He didn‚Äôt give me any kisses or hugs. He didn‚Äôt do anything he normally does. He just sat on the couch with our daughter drinking his coffee and watching TV with her‚Ä¶..practically ignoring me. He seemed emotionless. He didn‚Äôt text me all day today like normal. He didn‚Äôt send me any funny pictures of him and our daughter. The only thing he texted me was that he‚Äôs going on a fishing trip with his friends this weekend and I‚Äôd have to watch our daughter. I had planned on spending this weekend together because i have it off. I just responded with ‚Äúok‚Äù. I haven't left work to go home yet.

I feel so defeated. I feel like I made a horrible mistake pushing him to do this and taking this position. Has anyone else gone through something similar with their husbands when they became SAHD's? I know for some men it can be a shot to their masculinity and maybe that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs feeling. I‚Äôm so lost and sad. Taking time off work is not an option (I signed a contract) so I don‚Äôt know what to do.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**locutussum**

>From what I'm hearing, it isn't his masculinity he's questioning. He seems to be very comfortable with your daughter, especially if he usually tends to send funny pics of / with her. He literally spelled it out for you, lady : he feels unappreciated as your husband because you spend every little bit of your energy on your job. I used to study physics and now med - I know it's difficult but you REALLY. REALLY. NEED. TO. SAVE. MORE. ENERGY. FOR. HIM. Your marriage may depend on it. He's simply fed up being brushed off by you. Two months and being brushed off 20 times? The accusations of infidelity? He's not questioning his masculinity. He's questioning YOU as his wife.

**&**

>And I frankly very much understand him. The SAHD situation? He's handling it with grace and I'm very certain if you show him more attention, care, love and intimacy there's absolutely a 100% chance he'll be happy being a SAHD. But this life? It isn't sustainable. You're basically cutting him out of your life and making his insecurities come up - but you're the source of them, not his SAHD lifestyle. If my hypothetical wife brushed me off 20!!!! Times in a row... Imagine how you'd feel if your husband did that. You're a scientist, I reckon, so act like one. Analyze the issue. Find solutions.

**OOP**

>>""Imagine how you'd feel if your husband did that. You're a scientist, I reckon, so act like one. Analyze the issue. Find solutions.""

>>This struck me. And you're right. I've been putting myself in his shoes all day and feel an intense amount of guilt that I've let it get this bad. And looking back all the indicators were there....I just didn't address them. Too wrapped up in my own chaotic world of work and business. I know significant changes have to happen and I will do anything to make him feel loved and appreciated again....because I do love and appreciate him.

**~**

**pinuslaughus**

>It's called work life balance. Working 60+ hours a week is unsustainable and unfair to your family. Your husband being an SAHD isn't the problem. You are working too much. This is what is blowing up your marriage. If you need to do stretches of long day six day weeks you should also get a string of 3 or 4 days off. If your company cannot do this quit. Tell your husband you are going to do this if you want to save your relationship.

**OOP**

>>I plan on talking with my manager and being blunt that if changes in my schedule cant be made I will lose my family and that id quit before I let that happen. I am on a somewhat personal level with my boss so im optimistic that if im honest they will work with me. They'd be hurting if I were to quit.

I do prioritize getting out and going for walks (it‚Äôs good for all of us) but, inexcusably, I know exactly why I‚Äôve gained all of this weight‚Ä¶ and it could‚Äôve been avoided. I could‚Äôve reached for an apple or a banana rather than a roll. I could‚Äôve packed a protein bar instead of going through a drive through for a bagel. 
Over the last 10months, recovering from a c section, caring for an infant and my children, I‚Äôve made really poor choices in diet and reached for fast food or take out meals more than I‚Äôd like to admit. 

I am counting calories. I am using macro factor for the first time. It has me at significantly less calories than other apps (about 500 less than chronometer, MFP, and lose it) but I‚Äôm trying to trust the app and give it a try. 

I am doing well with staying within my calorie goals, I don‚Äôt go over carbs. I‚Äôm struggling to eat all of my protein, and I am always over my fat by the middle of the day. 

I get 40g of fat/day. 
Today I had coffee with cream and sugar (measured out. I really enjoy my coffee at home and would prefer to skip a snack or make cuts elsewhere if I can.) 

I had a protein shake: 1 scoop of Orgain ‚Äúsimple‚Äù (10g protein) and a collagen packet (10g protein), almond milk, a banana, a tbsp chia seeds, and some of a jiff-to go peanut butter cup (I buy the pre portioned cups so that I can easily count the calories) 

About 4hrs later I had 1/2 of a Dave‚Äôs English muffin with the rest of the peanut butter & carrot/cucumber sticks. 

And I‚Äôm done with my fat allotment for today. 

The reason I am asking for help and not just cutting the fat (peanut butter, chia seeds) is because, I did try giving up the peanut butter and reducing other fat sources in the morning. I was uncomfortably hungry when I did this. 
I am able to stay within my calorie / carb limits much easier when I do have the fats. 

Do I cut the fat and just let myself be uncomfortable? If that‚Äôs the answer I‚Äôll do it. 

Or do I focus on my calories and carbs (I had gestational diabetes so I‚Äôm working on being conscious of carb intake) and work on the fat later?

Jokes aside, I talk about the changing of the direction of hsr (more predatory) which has already happened to genshin and hi3rd so you can be aware of it early in ZZZ, which is currently a honeymoon period. I also talk about some powercreep red flags in ZZZ and how due to ZZZ's monthly revenue dropping (i forgot which month), the devs started to listen. I also talk about economics where they teach you that corporations look to maximize profits first before anything else. Moreover, gacha games start tumbling down as soon as they cater to whales only. I also talk about how reddit's system caters to its community only by giving examples about how I got downvoted in the hsr subreddit for pointing out its powercreep issues and how I could no longer voice any opinions in that subreddit. I also state the reasons why I love zzz for its non-hoyoshill community and zzz catering to a niche community, which is us gooners. I also talk about the changing of the world (our lifestyles, our perceptions, America's waning influence, etc.) and how it makes us more divided and more fanatical. The changing world is sending people to the extremes. Either you're a hoyoshill or a non-hoyoshill. Either you're a Dem or a Republican. Either you're woke or anti-woke. I also compare gacha gamers to phone buyers, some of who stopped buying the iphone 16, which was just a slightly buffed iphone 15. Well, ofc the circumstances are not totally similar in that we have sunk costs in gacha games while we can sell our iphones anytime we think Apple becomes too greedy and use a better phone. I also talk about how apple maintains its iphone quality (the 16 could never be worse than the 15 or everyone would erupt) while gacha games go downhill and gacha gamers are content with it. 

**Problems in hsr**

You may or may not know the drama happening in hsr right now with 3.2 or since 2.6. I think this sums up the powercreep issue of hsr.

https://preview.redd.it/gbe8a10w6ple1.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d0c893489e120219c756ff9889ae7432267791c

2.0 Archeron, the meta dps back then powercrept 1.0 characters but not by so much so ppl were fine. They also gave out dr. ratio who was also pretty cracked back then so ppl were ""Genshin could never"". 3.0 is the current version of HSR. In zzz, we dont die easily because we've got a healer, astra, shielder, caesar. We can parry, we can dodge. But in hsr, you heal or shield or you die. Ofc, you can revive. Now, castorice, the 2nd anniversary character of HSR will most likely have a free revive for everyone on the team even if she's not on the team. Moreover, there's gonna be a whale shop where e6 owners (you call it e6 there) can select any 5\* they want if they get an extra copy of that e6 character. You can also select any 5\* LC (W-engines here) after buying the battle pass (the 10$ one). They're not giving any additional rewards or whatever to f2ps and low spenders.

**Whales**

Now, I'm not hateful towards whales cuz they fund gacha games. But when you only cater to them (I myself have most of the 5\* and have had to pull 70/80/90 times for every S rank) and not cater to the f2ps and low-spenders (I would not call myself a low-spender but with my luck im a low-spender), they are gradually gonna leave. It's about when. Now or later or much much later.

**Some red flags**

ZZZ is starting to show some red flags as well. First of all, miyabi broke the game and you can play her braindead. Then, evelyn and astra came out almost at the level of miyabi. For evelyn, you need to learn how to play her well (I personally prefer skill-based characters rather than braindead characters but this is subjective to me) so she reaches miyabi's dmg output. It's been quite long (if I rmb correctly) since zzz last released a 4\* in zzz but it's fine since they can still clear engame. But the endgame is favored towards the newest character like in hsr. This is also fine because skill can get you very far here.

**After the honeymoon period ends and we've fallen in love with zzz.....**

The problem is not now. It's after the honeymoon period ends. Now, I'm not saying it's 100% gonna happen but we can refer to past actions. It's like how most of us stay away from netmarble due to its notorious past. But so far, we've had better treatment than both genshin and hsr. We got harumasa who is still pretty good before trailblazers got their dr. ratio. We have many more fun events (which gives us more rewards or do we get more rewards per patch than HSR?) than genshin and hsr. The way the story is presented here is one of the best in the gacha gaming industry.

I like that there are less players in zzz because hoyoshills are just atrocious. I like that some genshin and hsr players haven't moved here because it's a ""gooner"" game. I like that zzz is a gooner game because I would always pull for waifus over husbandos unless the husbandos break the game like miyabi (but I'm not here to talk about that). I like that zzz's main audience is niche. I like that there are less content creators than established games like genshin and hsr.

**Hoyoverse's cc program**

Now, I'm not blaming the ccs, they also have to fill their stomach and make guides for the players. I'm also living on guides. But those of you who know know about the cc program of hoyoverse and there's absolutely no reason to think that zzz ccs are different from genshin and hsr ccs. Even if the game is bad (which zzz is far from currently ""currently""), the ccs will just say good things about their games (survival) and not put any criticisms. The main culprit is hoyoverse itself which narrates our perceptions and brainwashes (subjective, some ppl are more tolerant than others) players into thinking what hoyoverse wants the player to think. It's like how you can't speak bad about ahem ahem in China.

**Changing World**

With the way the world has changed over the years from being more united to more divided. It's evident in your most powerful country in the world, the US. Dems vs Republicans. Woke vs non-woke. hoyoshills vs non-hoyoshills. Although the US is still the most powerful country in the world both economically and militarily, its influence is gradually and gradually waning. In some areas, China is taking over. I'm just trying to show how the world has changed in the past decade or century or 50 years or whatever years. So in a world where countries are now increasingly looking out for their own national interests more, tariffs and trade-wars make everyone poor and more wars are eminent. The average people's living standards and wages are not increasing much anymore. Due to Covid which prevented us from touching grass, the digitilization of the world, dating and forming families becoming less prevalent because women's perceptions have changed (dating) and living costs are rising(families) .

**Small Scenario**

Let's say that you earn less than your wife monthly. I bet she's gonna ditch you if she finds a richer guy cuz she can also claim half your money from divorcing lol.

**Reddit**

Ok, I got sidetracked a bit. My main point about these last 3 headings are that our unity has been broken. In hsr, I got downvoted to the point of oblivion for talking bad about the game. I mean I also have my sunk cost fallacy so i want the game to last longer. After getting downvoted, I can't post anything anymore in the hsr subreddit. Let me rant my rage about reddit while I'm at it. I think reddit is community-focused but the system filters out the narration that the people in the subreddit don't like or want. Also, if you want to post content in the hsr subreddit, you need to talk to the mods. But anyways, I personally believe that repetition is a good thing. I know some of you check reddit too often but I'm not a reddit person so I personally don't mind repetitive true and not misinformed feedback about any game in any subreddit. But, it's just me.

**Community**

I know most are competitive while the remaining is casual but in the hsr community, even f2ps are not united. The thing is, we need to be united as a whole to stand our ground, to take into our own hands our national interests. f2ps need to form their community to call out hoyo or any company whatsoever if they feel like they're being mistreated or treated unfairly. i think whales already have their own community where they can also demand some perks if the f2ps and low spenders get their own perks.

**Economics**

Gacha gamers seriously astound me. We're taught in economics that resources are limited while wants are unlimited but gacha gamers have no wants lol. And let's be honest, hoyo has more than enough resources. Even the iphone 16 sales got hit cuz it was the same trash every year and people somehow escaped from the brainwashing lol and some didn't buy. Like honestly, we've become too attached to physical materials (i should say 2d counts too) and too much is never good. I don't have the power to change the trend so I'm also having to go along with it. I love evelyn so much that I think about her assets when I'm back home but when I'm at school, I focus on school.

Last but not least, gacha gamers are the best customers for companies and they should take up some economics class so they know that every company looks to maximize profits first and that they can want something better.

**Bad Quality = Greed**

If the company is not facing any issues like gov regulations or gov fines or recession and they lower the quality, it's greed. Even Apple maintains their standards so the iphone 16's quality does not drop below that of the iphone 15's.

In the first one or 2 years, hoyo starts selling you 500 ml of coffee at 5$. In the coming years, they sell you 400 ml of coffee at 5$. You defend and say it's due to inflation but to make things worse, hoyo decides to give your coffee in a plastic bag instead of a paper cup (One unit of paper cup is more expensive than a small plastic bag). Then, hoyo decides to lay off 1 worker so now your coffee is not as hot when you receive it because the 1 employee stores some readymade coffee in an insulator so that he won't be overwhelmed by the massive numbers of customers. The customers (no gacha gamers included except maybe a few) would complain to hoyo about the employee not doing his job well. Then hoyo lays off that last employee and gets a robot which can work more than a person but the robot cannot offer prudent customer service. The robot's monthly maintenance fees are less than one employees' minimal wage set by the government. You have to scan a QR code to read the menu on your small little phone. Older people suffer.

**It's all about money**

I'm pretty sure zzz's monthly revenue (i forgot which month) dropped substantially so hoyo was quick to fix it. Even Apple is investing in AI to make the iphone 17 more lucrative for customers. Talk does not work with corporations. You gotta walk the talk and stop sending money. That is the ONLY way, ladies and gentlemen for f2ps and low-spenders to at least survive.

**Your health is important**

Stop playing a game that's becoming too p2w and go do sth else. Touch some grass, play chess, get some pHDs so you can whale for your waifus, play some other game. YOU DESERVE BETTER. Every second of your time you're playing a shitty gacha game you could have spent playing a better one. The same applies for money, but you can find it back later. You can't get back the time you've already lost. I know what's better is subjective but you just have to keep finding it. I know the world is becoming more on the phone (especially for Gen Zs) and the addiction will only get worse with the metaverse. Maybe go check your screen times to see if you could somehow reduce them. Stop eating grass so that you can be healthy for long and keep enjoying your gacha games until the age of 100. Admit your sunk costs as a mistake that you have to be beware of in the future and learn from it. I myself have learnt my lesson with hsr and I will tread carefully with my pulls in zzz so I don't get called out ""greedy and stupid"" by Mr. Pokke. But honestly, I will always be greedy and stupid for evelyn.

PS...The direction has always gone from ok to worse with hi3rd, hsr and genshin. If the same things from those games happen to ZZZ, I'm gonna have to give hoyo the netmarble treatment.

Forgot to mention, hsr pretended to listen by buffing the older 1.0 characters. But, by the time they get buffed, the newest characters are gonna powercreep them hard. The p2w store where you get double gacha currency is gonna reset on hsr's 2nd anniversary, which is when, castorice is gonna release. Also, we had mauvika and citalali in one patch with hoyo giving out 20 pulls only after those 2 banners were over and the archon and ice granny powercrept everyone else.",0,1740674758.0,ZenlessZoneZero,24,0.32,False

At least not in the way you imagine. We grow up believing happiness is some grand prize at the end of a long, hard road ‚Äî something we achieve through success, hard work, or ticking off life‚Äôs major goals. But what if that‚Äôs a lie?

The truth is, happiness isn‚Äôt a destination ‚Äî it‚Äôs found in the small, fleeting moments of everyday life. It‚Äôs the warmth of sunlight on your face, a quiet cup of coffee in the morning, laughing uncontrollably with a friend. It‚Äôs not earned through grinding or suffering ‚Äî it‚Äôs experienced when you let yourself enjoy simple pleasures without constantly chasing after ‚Äúmore.‚Äù

We tell ourselves, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be happy when I graduate,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be happy when I get that job,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be happy when I find love‚Äù ‚Äî and then we reach those milestones, and the happiness fades quickly. Why? Because happiness isn‚Äôt an achievement ‚Äî it‚Äôs an experience.

But there‚Äôs another side to this too. I believe there‚Äôs a beautiful synergy between effort and happiness. While happiness exists in the small moments, working hard and striving for goals gives life a sense of purpose and direction. Imagine life without ambition ‚Äî it would lack growth and excitement. The satisfaction of achieving something after dedication and perseverance adds depth to those simple pleasures.

For me, happiness isn‚Äôt just about stillness or contentment ‚Äî it‚Äôs also about progress and learning. The struggle itself can be meaningful, and the joy of overcoming challenges often enhances those moments of peace.

I can eat food without any spices or salt just boiled like no problem, I can dry scoop coffee without water like how people eat Candy, I can blend in my food to make a smoothy and drink it.


In summers I can sit I'm a room without fan or air conditioner with no problem and the place I live in temperature can go as high as 47C.


My sense of pain is also very less I once broke my toes and took me 3 days to go to the doctor to find out it was a minor facture. I some time get cuts I don't remember getting.


My sense of getting sick is also kind of low.

My emotional feeling are also very low like really low.


I don't remember being this emotion less feeling less voide of person I was like very happy, kind, funny, full of feelings kind of person. Now everything I do is masking like I created a persona  of a person to hide what's inside.

1izjz8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wirelessearbudsreview/comments/1izjz8q/uncover_if_skullcandy_rail_anc_wireless_earbuds/,Uncover if Skullcandy Rail ANC Wireless Earbuds deliver premium sound performance review,"I've had the chance to use the Skullcandy Rail ANC wireless earbuds for a couple of weeks now, and they‚Äôve earned a mix of admiration and critique. These earbuds promise a blend of premium sound quality, active noise cancellation, long battery life, and customizable features. But do they truly live up to the hype?

**Sound Quality & Performance**

The sound quality is where these earbuds truly shine. The dynamic drivers deliver a deep bass that feels rich without overwhelming the mids and highs. Whether I was listening to bass-heavy tracks or detailed instrumental pieces, the audio clarity was impressive. Additionally, the Skull-iQ app allows for sound customization. Using the app, I could tweak the equalizer and create a sound profile that matched my preferences, which elevated the listening experience. However, while the sound is great, I noticed that the noise-canceling feature, though effective, isn‚Äôt as robust compared to some competitors like Bose or Sony. It tones down ambient noise but doesn‚Äôt entirely eliminate it.

[Check Skullcandy Rail ANC Wireless Earbuds price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0c9ngnbpg/)

**Fit & Comfort**

For someone who wears earbuds for extended periods, comfort is key. These earbuds come with rounded tips that fit snugly in my ears without causing discomfort. They stayed secure even during workouts, which was a win for me. However, I‚Äôve read some reports of allergic reactions to the ear tips, which is worth noting for sensitive users. In my case, I didn‚Äôt experience any irritation, but it‚Äôs something to consider for those with known sensitivities.

**Battery Life & Charging**

Battery life is another strong point. With noise cancellation activated, the earbuds lasted around 7 hours, and the charging case provided an additional 20 hours‚Äîplenty for a full day of use. Rapid charge is a lifesaver too, offering 2 hours of playback from just a 10-minute charge. While the performance is solid, charging the case takes a bit longer than I‚Äôd like, especially when I‚Äôm in a rush.

**Design & Build Quality**

The earbuds sport a sleek and modern design with a matte finish that feels durable. The carrying case is compact and lightweight, making it easy to slip into my pocket. However, the magnetic closure on the case could be a bit stronger; I found it opening accidentally a couple of times. For the price range, I expected slightly better build quality, but overall, it‚Äôs not a deal-breaker.

**Noise Cancellation & Ambient Mode**

The active noise cancellation (ANC) does a decent job of muting background noise, but it‚Äôs not groundbreaking. In quieter environments, it works well, but in a noisy coffee shop or on a busy street, some ambient sounds still seep through. On the flip side, the Stay-Aware mode is quite handy, amplifying external sounds when needed, like during conversations or while crossing the street.

**Durability & Water Resistance**

These earbuds are designed for physical activities like running and cycling, boasting an IPX4 rating for water resistance. During my workouts, they held up well against sweat and light rain. While they‚Äôre not fully waterproof, they‚Äôre sturdy enough for most everyday conditions.

**Warranty**

A one-year warranty is included, which is fairly standard. It provides peace of mind for any manufacturing defects, though it doesn‚Äôt cover wear and tear or potential allergic reactions to the materials.

**Advantages**

* Exceptional sound quality with deep bass and clear mids/highs.
* Customizable sound profiles through the Skull-iQ app.
* Long battery life with rapid charging capability.
* Comfortable fit that stays secure during activities.
* IPX4 water resistance suitable for workouts and light rain.

**Drawbacks**

* Noise cancellation could be more effective.
* Magnetic closure on the case feels weak.
* Reports of allergic reactions to the ear tips.
* Occasional connectivity issues with the app.

**Product Rivals**

When compared to the Apple AirPods Pro and Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, the Skullcandy Rail ANC offers a more affordable option with commendable sound quality. However, the ANC on the Bose earbuds is undoubtedly superior, and the Apple AirPods Pro provide a more seamless integration for iPhone users. If you‚Äôre looking for budget-friendly earbuds with solid performance, the Rail ANC stands out, but it still falls short in a direct feature-to-feature comparison with these high-end competitors.

**Budget-Friendly**

While the price tag is lower than premium brands like Sony or Bose, the Rail ANC still offers many premium features. For those who aren‚Äôt ready to splurge but want excellent sound and decent ANC, these earbuds strike a good balance. However, if noise cancellation is your top priority, it might be worth investing in a pricier model.

I‚Äôve been using it daily for several weeks, and it‚Äôs given me the chance to break free from the usual coffee shop runs. Whether it‚Äôs making a perfect espresso or frothy cappuccino, this machine has its charm but also a few quirks. Let‚Äôs dive into the specifics.

**Design & Build Quality**

The design of this espresso machine is sleek and simple, with a matte black finish that fits seamlessly into my kitchen. Its compact size (11.2"" x 11.2"" x 15"") is a huge plus for those of us with limited counter space. While the build materials don‚Äôt scream ""luxury,"" they feel durable enough for everyday use. The stainless steel frothing pitcher is a nice touch, adding a professional vibe to the setup. However, I did notice that the portafilter feels a bit tight during the first few uses, requiring some extra effort to lock it in place.

**Brewing Performance**

This little machine delivers with its steam-brewing process, which consistently produces rich, dark espresso. I‚Äôve tried brewing both a single shot and the full four-shot capacity, and it manages to maintain a decent flavor profile throughout. Perfect for making Cuban coffee, the extra-large portafilter does its job well. That said, the brewing process is slower than I‚Äôd like, taking about three minutes for the espresso alone. If you‚Äôre someone who values speed, this might be a minor inconvenience.

[Ready to snag Mr. Coffee BVMCECM-STMMN-BL? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0c3n7b91q/)

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**

The frothing wand is surprisingly effective for a machine in this price range. I‚Äôve used it to make lattes, cappuccinos, and even milk steamers for the kids, and it creates a light, velvety froth without too much effort. The included stainless steel frothing pitcher makes this process even easier. However, the steaming process adds another four minutes to your morning routine, and that‚Äôs not counting the cleanup.

**Coffee Quality**

In terms of taste, this machine delivers a decent cup of espresso, though it doesn‚Äôt quite reach the level of professional-grade machines. The crema it produces is minimal, so if you‚Äôre an espresso purist, you might be left wanting. However, for everyday coffee drinkers or those who enjoy milk-based drinks, it‚Äôs more than adequate. I‚Äôve found the flavor to be consistent, provided I use quality beans and grind them correctly.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**

Cleaning this machine is fairly straightforward, which is a blessing for those of us who dread post-coffee cleanup. The removable water pitcher and frothing wand are easy to rinse off, and the reusable filter eliminates the need for paper filters. That said, you‚Äôll need to be careful with the steam wand, as it can get quite hot and requires immediate cleaning to avoid milk residue buildup.

**Water Tank & Capacity**

The water pitcher features measurement markings, which helps ensure consistent brewing and steaming. I‚Äôve found the 4-shot capacity to be perfect for making multiple drinks in one go without constantly refilling. However, the process of refilling can be a bit inconvenient if you‚Äôre making coffee for a larger group.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**

This machine operates quietly compared to some other espresso makers I‚Äôve tried, which is a blessing during the early hours when everyone else is still asleep. Energy efficiency isn‚Äôt explicitly mentioned, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to consume an excessive amount of power during use.

**Warranty & Support**

The machine comes with a standard warranty, and Mr. Coffee's customer service team is relatively responsive. While I haven‚Äôt had to reach out for any major issues, it‚Äôs good to know they are there if needed.

**Merits**

* Compact size fits well into small kitchens
* Effective frothing wand for creamy lattes and cappuccinos
* Easy-to-clean design with reusable filter
* Quiet operation and decent brewing performance

**Limitations**

* Slower brewing and steaming process
* Minimal crema for espresso purists
* Tight portafilter requires effort to lock in initially
* Lacks a carafe, causing some mess during brewing

**Competitive Options**

When comparing this machine to similar products, the De‚ÄôLonghi EC155 is a strong contender. It offers a semi-automatic brewing experience and produces a better crema, but it comes at a slightly higher price point. On the flip side, Capresso Steam PRO is another alternative that provides similar steam-brewing functionality but has a less user-friendly design. The Mr. Coffee machine excels in its compact design and ease of use but falls short in terms of espresso quality and brewing speed compared to its rivals.

**Worth Every Penny**

In terms of value, this espresso machine is a great entry point for anyone looking to make cafe-style drinks at home without breaking the bank. While it may not satisfy seasoned baristas, it‚Äôs an affordable and practical option for everyday coffee enthusiasts. The features it offers at its price point are hard to beat, making it a smart choice for budget-conscious coffee lovers.

# What if buried within your DNA was a forgotten archive of ancestral knowledge ‚Äî just waiting for the right key to unlock it?

View the [Original Post](https://tripsitter.substack.com/p/harmine-ancestral-memory)

Last week, we covered the late¬†[Terence McKenna](https://tripsitter.substack.com/p/terence-mckenna), one of the psychedelic movement's greatest visionaries. As a huge psychedelics nerd, I love McKennas‚Äô wild theories about¬†[the passage of time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFKAk68C5Q),¬†[the nature of consciousness](https://www.organism.earth/library/document/crisis-in-consciousness), and the¬†[origins of human evolution](https://tripsitter.substack.com/p/stoned-ape-theory).

One of his more out-there theories I've been thinking a lot about lately is the idea that¬†**harmine**¬†‚Äî a key alkaloid contained in ayahuasca ‚Äî could act as¬†**a biochemical key to access a hidden archive of ancestral memories**¬†**stored within our DNA.**

This theory was explored in-depth in¬†[*The Invisible Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens, and the I Ching*](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Landscape-Mind-Hallucinogens-Ching/dp/0062506358)¬†‚Äî a book co-authored by Terence and his brother, Dennis McKenna.

The McKenna brothers hypothesized that DNA was more than just a genetic code guiding our growth and development ‚Äî but is also a vast repository of information storing ancestral memory and forgotten wisdom.

The ancestral memory theory, as presented by the McKenna brothers, overlaps with Jung's definition of the¬†**collective unconscious**¬†‚Äî which is a deep, inherited layer of the psyche that holds the experiences of our ancestors. Much like the McKennas, Jung believed we could tap into the collective unconscious to access these stored memories using altered states of consciousness and dreams.

This theory is pretty wild and science-fictiony. It reminds me of this idea of ""**other memory**"" as presented in the Dune novels by Frank Herbert. In this series, other memory is only accessible by highly-trained Bene Gesserit sisters who undergo (and survive) a dose of deadly poison. If they survive, they're able to draw from the memories of their maternal ancestors by accessing it from their DNA.üòé

Here, we're going to explore some fascinating research that adds credibility to McKenna's ancestral memory hypothesis ‚Äî most of which wasn't published until¬†*after*¬†Terence's untimely death.

While this research is far from conclusive, it's (at the very least), an interesting thought experiment to explore further.

# Harmala Alkaloids & the Alchemy of Consciousness

When discussing ayahuasca, most people focus only on DMT (dimethyltryptamine) ‚Äî but the true key to the brew's visionary experience lies in the harmala alkaloids.

Unlike DMT, these compounds aren‚Äôt overtly psychedelic on their own, yet they play a crucial role in unlocking its full potential.

There are a total of 64 compounds known as the Œ≤-carbolines (AKA ""harmala alkaloids""). These alkaloids can be found throughout the plant kingdom (roughly 120 species spread across 8 families). A few examples of common plants that produce these alkaloids include coffee (*Coffea arabica*), passionflower (*Passiflora spp.*), Syrian rue (*Peganum harmala*), and¬†[tobacco (Nicotiana¬†](https://tripsitter.substack.com/p/smoke-signals)[*spp.*](https://tripsitter.substack.com/p/smoke-signals)[)](https://tripsitter.substack.com/p/smoke-signals).

The ayahuasca vine (*Banisteriopsis caapi*) is especially rich in harmala alkaloids, which play a crucial role in activating DMT from a companion plant ‚Äî typically¬†*Mimosa hostilis*¬†or¬†*Psychotria viridis,*¬†depending on the locale.

The harmala alkaloids are a fascinating group of compounds on their own, as many offer powerful medicinal, psychoactive, and neuroprotective qualities.

**Here are just 4 examples:**

1. **Harmine ‚Äî**¬†Acts as an MAO inhibitor that allows DMT to become orally active. This compound is the key to the shamanic brew, ayahuasca. Without it, the DMT would be destroyed before it could induce its psychedelic effects.
2. **Tetrahydroharmine ‚Äî**¬†A mild serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that works to enhance mood and boosts the visionary qualities of ayahuasca.
3. **Harman & Neoharmane ‚Äî**¬†Present in tobacco smoke and believed to contribute some of the psychoactive properties of the plant (including its heart-opening effects as recognized in shamanic medicine).
4. **Harmaline ‚Äî**¬†Another potent MAO inhibitor similar to harmine but with stronger sedative and hypnotic effects. It is thought to contribute to the dream-like, introspective states of ayahuasca.

# Harmine Binds to Human DNA

Of all the harmala alkaloids in the ayahuasca vine, the McKenna brothers focused on one in particular ‚Äî harmine ‚Äî which is¬†[present in the ayahuasca vine](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Biodiversity-of-%CE%B2-Carboline-Profile-of-caapi-and-a-Santos-Oliveira/a96c4d42c266f947d931f9418b0ac4ed2f9a4aeb)¬†in concentrations ranging from 0.3% to 8.4%.

Terence believed this compound had a unique relationship with human DNA ‚Äî speculating that it could unlock hidden ancestral memories stored within our genetic code. While this idea may sound far-fetched, recent studies have shown that harmine does, in fact,¬†[bind to human DNA](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Structure-activity-insights-of-harmine-targeting-in-Sarkar-Tribedi/f73235df3526e5594a45d23cdfe79e670554010b?utm_source=consensus), influencing gene expression in ways we still don't fully understand.

In 2016, a group of researchers set out to examine the molecular basis for harmine's impressive¬†[anti-cancer action](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2024.1382142/full)¬†by¬†[examining its potential to bind to human DNA](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27590873/)¬†(a property that's common in many anti-cancer drugs). Their findings not only supported the hypothesis that harmine can bind to human DNA, but also raised new questions about how this interaction could influence cellular function beyond the scope of cancer treatment.

Another study later that year explored¬†[the specific DNA-binding mechanisms of harmine](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Targeting-G-quadruplex-DNA-and-B-DNA-with-a-natural-Mandal-Bhattacharya/12436335cf6592ebbc71acd8b72133b4bc32ad8a?utm_source=consensus). This study discovered that harmine binds to two different DNA structures ‚Äî GQ-DNA and B-DNA.

* **GQ-DNA**¬†is a specialized structure found in telomeres and gene regulatory regions, which play a role in genome stability and gene expression.
* **B-DNA**¬†is the classic double-helix structure that encodes genetic information.

While harmine showed a binding affinity for both types of DNA, it had a clear preference for GQ-DNA. The significance of this is that it seems harmine's interaction with DNA isn't random; it targets the way specific genes are turned on and off.

This doesn't mean harmine literally ""reads"" stored memories ‚Äî at least not in the way the McKenna brother's envisioned. However, it does suggest a mechanism by which harmine could influence brain function in ways we never thought possible ‚Äî affecting memory, perception, and consciousness in mysterious ways.

If nothing else, these findings are relevant to the field of cancer therapy, as most anti-cancer agents attack DNA indiscriminately ‚Äî leading to the many toxic side effects associated with chemotherapy medications. Harmine, on the other hand, appears to have more selective interactions, opening up possibilities for less toxic, targeted gene therapies in the future.

# Can Memories Be Stored in DNA?

Now that we know harmine can bind to and influence our DNA (though it's still unclear if this interaction translates to reading ancestral memories, we have to ask the question ‚Äî ""can memories even be stored in DNA in the first place?"")

People, I'm very excited to inform you that, YES, we can store information using DNA with shocking efficiency ‚Äî but there are caveats.‚Ä¶

# 1. DNA Can Store Information ‚Äî Just Not Like We Thought

A research group led by¬†[Fahim Farzadfard](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/fellow/fahim-farzadfard/)¬†successfully¬†[converted genomic DNA into a functional memory system](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1256272)¬†in living bacterial cells. The technology, which Farzadfard calls SCRIBE (Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biological Events), can even continue to accumulate information over time ‚Äî acting as a sort of ""biological tape recorder.""

The system uses single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and recombinase enzymes to introduce precise, heritable mutations in response to external stimuli. These mutations act as a biological record of past experiences that can be retrieved later through sequencing or other methods.

If bacteria can use their DNA to record and retrieve past environmental exposures, could something similar be happening in higher organisms, including humans?

Could certain experiences leave heritable imprints on DNA through a yet-undiscovered mechanism?

**If harmine interacts with DNA (as other studies confirm), could it play a role in accessing or modifying stored genetic information?**

This research proves that DNA is capable of storing memory like data ‚Äî even if it hasn‚Äôt been observed in humans (yet).

# 2. DNA's Storage Potential is Astronomical

The human genome can (theoretically) store around¬†[215 petabytes of information per gram](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/DNA-Fountain-enables-a-robust-and-efficient-storage-Erlich-Zielinski/523f8eaa544e9faa80973cc9599e0f50b6d57ce8?utm_source=consensus)¬†‚Äî that's an absolutely staggering amount of information. To date, humanity has generated an estimated¬†[33 trillion gigabytes of digital information](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dna-the-ultimate-data-storage-solution/). The genome is so efficient at storing information, all of humanity's data could be stored in a space the size of a ping-pong ball.

That's an order of magnitude more efficient than even the most advanced solid-state storage devices available right now. Nothing even comes close.

Before we get too excited, I have to caveat that the application of DNA as a storage medium has only been proven for the purpose of artificial data storage.

**Is there any evidence of actual human memories recovered from DNA?**

No‚Ä¶ but there‚Äôs still some compelling evidence worth exploring‚Ä¶

# 3. The Mystery of Junk DNA

The human genome consists of around 3.2 billion base pairs ‚Äî when Terence McKenna was still alive, only 2% of it was thought to do anything at all. The remaining 98% were considered ""junk"" simply because scientists didn't understand their function. Since then, researchers have¬†**reduced this unknown section to around 80%**¬†‚Äî but that still leaves us with a ridiculously high portion we still don't understand.

**Here's how it breaks down:**

* **Protein-Coding DNA**¬†(\~1.5‚Äì2%) ‚Äî The part of the genome that directly codes for the proteins that sustain life.
* **Known Functional Non-Coding DNA**¬†(\~10‚Äì15%) ‚Äî this includes telomeres, introns, and regulatory DNA that turn on/off various genes.
* **Repetitive & Transposable Elements**¬†(\~50%) ‚Äî this includes transposons (jumping genes), microsatellites, and tandem repeats.
* **Completely Unknown DNA**¬†(\~30‚Äì35%) ‚Äî Does not fit into any of the above categories; its function remains a mystery.

Scientists have since categorized much of this ""junk"" DNA, but a significant portion remains enigmatic, particularly the vast stretches of repetitive sequences that make up nearly half of our genome.

Most scientists agree these repeating snippets (which can repeat hundreds of times) aren't just random junk but evolutionary relics with hidden roles.¬†[The ENCODE Project](https://www.encodeproject.org/)¬†has shown that much of this so-called ""junk"" influences things like gene expression, cell function, and cell adaptation.

Despite these breakthroughs,¬†**30‚Äì35% of our genome remains a mystery**. Whether it holds forgotten biological functions, dormant instructions, or something stranger, one thing is clear ‚Äî our DNA is far more complex than we ever imagined. Considering the vast, unknown regions of our DNA, in combination with the staggering data-like storage capacity of DNA, it‚Äôs tempting to wonder if these sequences contain an untapped biological archive.

# More Than DNA: How Experience Gets Passed Down Through Generations

Very recently, researchers have confirmed that ancestral ""memories"" in the form of stress responses, behavioral tendencies, and even cognitive abilities can be transferred from one generation to the next through¬†[epigenetic expression](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Transgenerational-Epigenetic-Contributions-to-Fact-Nestler/2b9ab9501ba97c24d3c17b16e523809f9643a1cc?utm_source=consensus).

These epigenetic modifications¬†**do not involve the permanent encoding of information into the genome itself**¬†and this form of transfer typically only lasts a couple of generations before it's lost.

**Epigenetic inheritance works for both positive and negative experiences.**¬†For example, one study demonstrated that young mice (15 days old) exposed to an ""enriched environment"" ‚Äî an environment in which the mice were most content, with plenty of things to play with and other mice to socialize with ‚Äî¬†[passed on enhanced cognitive abilities to their offspring](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Transgenerational-Rescue-of-a-Genetic-Defect-in-and-Arai-Li/1ed4ff5a5a5e42a888e71095d219c9cb8f521501?utm_source=consensus).

In another study, traumatized male mice¬†[passed on signs of trauma](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Alterations-in-sperm-long-RNA-contribute-to-the-of-Gapp-Gapp/68f4780f133d16c8869714f82b2d7c9248a11bee)¬†to their offspring, who exhibited increased stress responses, heightened anxiety, and altered metabolic function despite never experiencing the trauma firsthand. This transfer was linked to alterations in mRNA found in the father's sperm cells.

The reason why I believe this is significant is that¬†**it proves there are other ways our DNA can store and transmit information**¬†without physically altering the genetic code. These studies show that epigenetic markers regulate behavior, memory, and adaptation across generations in ways we're only¬†*just*¬†beginning to understand.

**Coming back to the McKenna brother's theory ‚Äî**¬†if harmine affects regulatory DNA, it's plausible that it could activate, suppress, or even modify some of these epigenetic ""memory"" markers.

# The Shamanic Perspective: Ancestral Knowledge & Plant Teachers

Terence and Dennis McKenna were far from the first people to suggest ayahuasca acts as a bridge to the ancestral realm.¬†[Amazonian shamans](https://tripsitter.substack.com/p/shamanism)¬†have been using this plant mixture to access knowledge that extends beyond an individual's lifetime for centuries.

Within this tradition, ayahuasca is not merely a psychedelic brew but a¬†**""plant teacher""**¬†‚Äî a conscious entity that¬†**imparts wisdom, reveals hidden truths, and connects individuals to the spirits of their ancestors.**¬†Plant teachers don't create knowledge; they reveal knowledge that's already there, hidden within the individual's lineage, spirit, or subconscious mind.

It's from this tradition that the McKenna brothers likely drew inspiration for their theory. The difference is that the McKennas, a product of Western scientific thinking, were focused more on the active ingredient (harmine) than the holistic and spiritual experience of the plant.

# Jung‚Äôs Collective Unconscious & the Science of Ancestral Memory

The final connection I want to touch on before we finish is the overlap between the McKenna brother's DNA memory theory and Carl Jung's concept of the collective unconscious.

**Jung described three layers of consciousness:**

1. **The Conscious Mind**¬†‚Äî Our waking awareness, rational thoughts, and perceptions.
2. **The Personal Unconscious**¬†‚Äî A storage of forgotten memories, suppressed emotions, and personal experiences.
3. **The Collective Unconscious**¬†‚Äî A deep, inherited layer of the psyche containing universal symbols, archetypes, and ancestral knowledge shared across all of humanity.

Carl Jung‚Äôs theory suggests that all humans inherit a subconscious framework of knowledge that influences our behaviors. Unlike the personal unconscious, which is shaped by individual experiences, the collective unconscious is innate ‚Äî passed down biologically rather than through learned experiences.

A lot of this theory mirrors the same ideas we've already explored ‚Äî just under different terminology.

If Jung was correct that ancestral experiences are stored in a hidden layer of the mind, could the McKennas have been right that DNA acts as the biological storage device? Is ayahuasca, and subsequently harmine, a biological key to unlocking information stored in the collective unconscious?

# The Verdict: DNA, Psychedelics & Ancestral Memory

At this point, we‚Äôve explored the scientific, philosophical, and shamanic perspectives surrounding the McKenna brother's ancestral DNA hypothesis.

We know harmine binds to DNA in ways that remain poorly understood. We know DNA is capable of storing and transmitting information far beyond what was previously thought possible. And we know epigenetic inheritance allows experiences ‚Äî both traumatic and nourishing ‚Äî to leave biochemical imprints that shape future generations.

But does any of this mean harmine, or ayahuasca more broadly, allows us to retrieve ancestral memory?

**The true answer remains elusive.**

If harmine influences gene expression, it‚Äôs plausible that it could activate dormant epigenetic markers, alter neural pathways, or enhance access to subconscious information in ways we don‚Äôt fully understand.

At the very least,¬†[ayahuasca seems to unlock something that changes us](https://tripsitter.substack.com/p/ketamine-ayahuasca-depression)¬†‚Äî whether that‚Äôs the collective unconscious, a biological mechanism for ancestral memory, or simply a deep well of personal and cultural symbolism buried in the subconscious mind.

For now, the question remains open, but I like to think there‚Äôs more to this story ‚Äî that one day, we‚Äôll discover a way to tap into our own ""other memory"" and unlock a wellspring of wisdom from the generations that lived before us.",1,1740673918.0,tripsitter,2,1.0,False

## What is a Breville Puck Sucker?

The Breville puck sucker is an innovative espresso accessory designed to cleanly and efficiently remove spent coffee grounds (the ""puck"") from your portafilter after brewing.It's a compact device that uses suction to gently extract the puck, eliminating the need for manual knocking or scraping. While Breville has popularized the term, it's essential to recognize that similar devices might exist under different branding or as DIY solutions. The core concept remains: a vacuum-powered system simplifying espresso puck disposal.

The Breville model typically features a cradle to securely hold the portafilter,an internal vacuum system to extract the puck,and a container to collect the used coffee grounds. Some models boast automatic activation, initiating the suction process when the portafilter is placed in the cradle. This hands-free operation streamlines workflow and minimizes mess.[[Explore Top rated breville puck sucker on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/breville/?kw=breville puck sucker)

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

The last couple of months I've found myself looking at the LP3 specs/blog posts/this sub when I'm bored.  I still use my iPhone to read comics when I'm bored at work, I still scroll reddit in the restroom.  My bad habits aren't just going to go away.  I've been putting off working on those habits, telling myself ""okay, I'll get my LP3 and make a new start"".  

I'm going to have to find something else to look forward to, and especially something else to *fill my time*.  Something beyond the bright lights and sounds and feelings of the internet.  Something beyond my new phone that will ""fix"" things.  I live in Mississippi and there is not a lot of infrastructure for ""things to do"".  You really have to make it for yourself here.  

I am in my 30's, working a desk job.  I have a partner, we are never having kids (medically confirmed and chosen).  I find myself looking down the barrel at a whooooole lot of TIME on my hands.  I really have no idea what I'm going to do with it.  It is, frankly, scary.  I hope to use it as an opportunity to discover many new versions of myself.  I hope I continue down this path towards ""unplugging"" completely.

I write this here not to search for my answers, but to reach out into the void and say ""THIS IS WHERE I AM"".  I'm glad to have found like-minded people here in this sub, both the users and workers for Light making cool things happen.  I'm thankful for the encouragement this community makes me feel.  I hope that one day (probably still years from now... after we've exhausted discussing our new phone) I'll get off reddit and the internet and you'll never hear from me again.  But maybe you'll see my LP3 sitting on a table at a coffee shop.  I hope you come over and say hi.

1izjlrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1izjlrt/recently_started_having_daily_headaches/,Recently Started Having Daily Headaches,"F(23), and I‚Äôve been having increasingly more common headaches the past several months. Full disclaimer‚ÄîI‚Äôm a huge hypochondriac, so I‚Äôm probably overreacting, but this has me worried.

I started a new job in June, which requires me to look at my monitor and write all day. I‚Äôve tried wearing blue-light glasses (albeit, cheap ones) and taking screen breaks and stretch breaks during work, but I still get a headache every night around 6 PM. It‚Äôs mostly in the back of my neck, but sometimes it radiates across the top of my head. Occasionally, I wake up with a headache as well. Ibuprofen fixes it, but I don‚Äôt take it every day for the sake of my other organs lol.

I exercise around five times a week, including strength training for my back. I drink some form of caffeine every morning, but it‚Äôs usually a cup of coffee or tea. I‚Äôd be shocked if my daily consumption was over 75mg, and I drink it very slowly. It‚Äôs also important to note that I got a new bed and pillows around the time I started my new job, and while the pillows are insanely comfortable, they are rather thick and tall.

The headaches aren‚Äôt debilitating, but they are painful and make me very irritable. I‚Äôve noticed an increase in the number since starting my new job, which I was expecting, but it‚Äôs turned into an almost daily occurrence the past several weeks. 

I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs likely a tension headache from my likely shitty posture, or eye strain from looking at my monitor all day at work (or both). It stresses me out after work because apart from my daily exercise (around an hour), most of my hobbies are probably tough on the eyes. Reading, video games, drawing, jigsaw puzzles, movie watching, etc. 

I guess my questions are‚Äîdoes this sound more like a tension headache, eye strain, caffeine withdrawal, or something else? If you deal with anything similar, how have you helped it? And does anyone have any other low-eye-strain hobbies?

The motif is right up my alley, so I‚Äôm absolutely in love, although I did run into the same issues a lot of folks have with ill fitting yokes.

despite that, unfortunately I ran into some health issues and had no sick time. i know how that goes all too well bc of this sub now, but i was newly discovering my chronic vestibular migraine issue when i got hired. they made me spend all of my probation period thinking i‚Äôd get let go at 90 days because of attendance. then, after 90 days passed, nobody said a word. my hours have been less than 20 a week since Christmas ended, and even then i only got good hours surrounding the holidays and never any time else.  

and finally, my TL behaves like a child who just got line leader for the day. as someone who has been a coffee shop supervisor, she is absolutely not cut out to be a TL and if she were working alongside me in any actual coffee shop, she‚Äôd get canned for her attitude. she made it a point to treat me differently because of my experience, being extra nitpicky over insignificant things but then also never letting me do the most simple but important things like putting away a pallet or doing a food pull (both of which i COULD do, but literally am never given the chance to). there‚Äôs genuinely so much more i could say here bc besides the hours, she‚Äôs genuinely the reason i cant stand to be here anymore.

anyways, it‚Äôs pretty sad tbh. i actually asked to just step down to be an ODTM but they refused to work with me because they got all snide about the other job, so i said okay then ill just give yall my notice. before starting at Target i used to just be a guest who thought shit was sweet, clearly i learned very quickly how wrong i was. but oh well, back into the realm of actual coffee shops i go. my sincere apologies to anyone who has to deal with this any further because it‚Äôs garbage.

1izjjt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Berberine/comments/1izjjt6/berberine_update/,Berberine update,"Hello all. 


I have been asked by a few people to update users on my experience with Berberine. I am not a doctor, I am not sponsored by any product and I do not claim to be an expert. I am just giving my anecdotal experience thus far. Here goes. 


I have been taking phytosomal Berberine from Enzymedica for upwards of 2 months now. It says to take twice a day but I only take it once a day with my coffee in the morning. At one point I tried a different brand but did not feel as good. With Enzym brand, I do not have the GI effects that some others deal with. 


I have found it to help with cravings and hunger. I don‚Äôt monitor my BG but I want to start so I can‚Äôt comment on that. I notice fewer vision problems, lower BP, and less cravings. The BIGGEST unexpected change that I‚Äôve seen is in my mood actually. I am so much more pleasant to be around. Anxiety is better and my ability to deal with stressors (I work a very stressful job) is also better. And I mean anxiety in every sense - general, social etc. 

Regarding weight loss, I haven‚Äôt seen a remarkable difference but maybe that would change by taking it twice like the bottle says - I am just hyper aware of hypoglycemia which I why I haven‚Äôt done that yet. 

I am curious to know if it does affect iron levels. I have heard that it can but haven‚Äôt found clear evidence in studies. That being said I am having iron deficiency type symptoms that are newer onset so I think it‚Äôs worth diving deeper into research and watching your labs.

(That's 3 ""here"" in one sentence, I need to relearn English lol)

There's this object finding game that I used to play on my mum's phone when I was like really young (2015-2018). I don't remember much about it except for the fact that I suddenly wanted to play it again for some reason and now I can't find it.

Here's what I remember from the game:

1. It had a pink/peach theme, the set up was a room/rooms based on levels with really good interior designing.
2. It was very feminine... (I'm sorry I'm making no sense) in the sense that the keys you were supposed to find were usually in these ""cases"" and they had heart-shaped pass code locks on them or smth
3. .It wasn't in first person pov(I'm sure there's a term for that which I don't know, I'm sorry), as in you couldn't move around the room to see/check things. You just had to click on objects, say a coffee table, and it would take you to a closer view of the table.
4. It had a gloominess to it, sort of liminal I would say. But not the scary liminal, it was more the kind that made you feel lonely.
5. There are youtube tutorials on how to pass the levels and where to find the objects/clues (I know because I got stuck on way too many levels than I'd like to admit)

That is all I remember about the game folks, I don't know why I have this weird memory of it being very pink/peach-ey
