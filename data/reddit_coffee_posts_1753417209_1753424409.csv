1m8rqh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1m8rqh0/tall_rant_in_a_venti_cup/,tall rant in a venti cup,"ok so i’m the newest partner at my store. i’m out of training and everything, but im definitely still a green bean compared to those who have been with our store since it opened. i’m a quick learner; i know the menu and drink builds well and i make customer connections. i write on cups, i keep my bar clean (most of the time). and yet i still worry for my job. 

here’s the problem. my schedule mainly allows for closing, so that’s what i work (except weekends). i can pretty much hold my own on bar during a mid or even on a weekend morning when we’re super busy. but i CANNOT for the life of me stay caught up when we’re super busy get these mini afternoon rushes. i don’t know if it’s because my store is near a beach, and people like to get their cold drink fix before/after spending some time there, or if it’s because my store is still relatively new (little over a year old) and in a busy town but we get the worst afternoon rushes. and we have to deal with those with 3 PEOPLE. and ofc the ssv has other tasks to complete. so my drive time gets bad bc im constantly soloing on drive and bar. 

and then ppl say “you should ask for support”. i do and maybe it’s just my ego but i feel incompetent when i have to ask. and im supposed to ask for help when the queue gets too long… first of all the ipads aren’t being left out all day/replaced when they need to be charged so i only have one DPM on drive in front of me. secondly my queue is perfectly manageable until i get a 4 drink mobile and they’ve all got different cold foams and blonde shots, and thirdly im taking DT orders, cashing out, cafe orders, prepping, trying to clean/break apart things, hot bar, cold bar, warming… its TOO MUCH! also the 3 matchas ordered together… i have one matcha pitcher out at a time. 😭 and even IF the siren allowed batching, it would work bc they’ve got different milks AND like 15 pumps of different syrups bc nobody ACTUALLY likes the taste of matcha AND they complain if the cold foam doesn’t fit perfectly on their light/no ice matcha. and don’t even get me started on stratos… I HAVE TWO FRAP BLENDERS AND ONE MATCHA/COLD FOAM PITCHER. i’m sitting in my car trying to decompress (got off work 45 min ago but stopped to get a drink at 7/11 lol). i get so stressed out. 

i get it, it’s a super busy chain coffee shop. but i feel like if we keep treating it like fast food, we’re going to lose the customer connection aspect of it. even when i have an opportunity, sometimes i don’t have the energy to connect because it’s two baristas struggling to run the floor, prep, clean, breakdown… it’s just so much. and being in a tourist town i have the opportunity to meet people from all over and have great conversations/connections! but i feel like all the extra hoops we jump through really hinder our efficiency and make us kinda unable to connect. i guess the whole point of this is to say i hope my store actually gets a precloser like we’ve been promised. it would help so much i am tired of soloing and drive times being up and feeling anxious about getting fired for poor performance when i know what im doing. 

thx for coming to my ted talk. ",1,1753424311.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False

1m8rpum,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m8rpum,You don't expect lawfulness if u don't provide convenience,"So today while returning from my college, I was stopped by a policeman as I was going wrong side and he took my photo and I am expecting a ₹1000-₹1500 fine now...
So why was I going wrong side...
The route from my hostel to my college is the 1st pic...
And same from my college to my hostel is the 2nd pic...

So if I lawfully want to follow the route, every working I should drive extra 6-7kms to return to my hostel....

Because there is no divider break in between...
Why is there no divider break??
Becoz the road in between is highway (Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway)... Obviously I shouldn't expect a divider break on a highway... And also there is bridge in between... So immediately after a bridge there obviously won't be any divider break...

So previously students of our college have requested for foot over bridge from above the highway which can be used by students for travelling... But they haven't built it... Nor any actions for our inconvenience.... A foot over bridge would be so helpful as our college don't have hostel facilities and hence most of their students live in hostels in surrounding regions.... Many students are benefitted....

But but but... A highway also has a fucking service road near city areas... But the service road from our side is taken... Yes taken... By whom? A builder to use that space for his materials or something... the service road is not available at all... If it was available... We could use it and then go on an intended way.... 

So these guys don't want to provide and check if public is inconvenient and just send police for fines... And even police are not working to their fullest.... See last photo... There today's goal is over.... 2-3 vehicles per day... Now they are chilling.... BC if u want to work then either work properly or don't work at all... Either way the result comes the same... I returned immediately after talking to my father about the situation and that policeman was not there..


So I don't know how our government is working coz even with this much labour available in India you can't maintain some basic requirements of public what are those taxes and fines for....

   “Little Danny Mallory? Well, well! Look who’s all grown up!”

Mr. Coleson welcomed Oak and I into his house with a warm grin, “Guess you’ve been busy, haven’t you kiddo?”

Of all the people to run into, I didn’t expect to run into Brad Coleson - especially not in another fucking country. But I guess it really is a small world. Coleson had aged, but it was still impossible not to recognize him. He still had the same lazy eye and goofy smile that I remembered from my high school days.

When I saw that Coleson was our witness… (and that it was in fact the very same Brad Coleson who’d taught me back in ninth grade) I’d almost been happy about it. I’d always liked him. I hadn’t really thought about him in years, but I’d be lying if I said that seeing him again didn’t make me at least a little happy.

   “Moving on up in the world,” I said. 

   “Clearly. What’s this, the first time you’ve been back home since you were in high school?”   “More or less,” I admitted with a sheepish laugh.

   “Good to see, good to see. Hell of a thing, seeing you all the way out here in Tevam Sound but it’s good to see you doing well!”

He gestured for Oak and I to take a seat in his living room. She had a picture of June Walker that she set on the coffee table but Coleson didn’t even look at it.

   “What can I get you?” He asked, “You want a soda or something?”

   “Yeah, that’d be great!”

I looked over at Oak, who seemed to hesitate for a moment before deciding that she wasn’t going to turn down a free soda.

   “One for me too,” She finally said.

Coleson returned with three glasses and set them on the table.

   “So… why don’t we get down to business. You were looking for a missing person, weren’t you?”

I nodded.

   “Yeah, exactly. You called in a tip?”

   “Yup. Hate to stick my nose in where it’s not wanted, but hey if some poor girl is missing, I want to do what I can to help.”

   “Much appreciated,” Oak said as she took a sip of her drink. “So where exactly did you see her?”

Coleson finally looked at the photo she’d provided, pulling it closer to him. It was probably outdated. The girl in it was barely out of her teens with long brown hair, freckles and intense eyes. 

   “Yeah… that’s definitely her,” He said. “She’s a bit older but I’ve seen her a few times down at a diner I frequent downtown. She’s never alone. She’s usually with some other girl and an older gentleman. Thinning hair, full beard. I know he lives around here. Seen him coming and going from the apartment on Aria Street. I imagine you’ll be able to find him from there. Not sure if she’s in there with him… she’s never seemed particularly distressed but, well you never know.”

I nodded.

   “Well, we can follow up with that lead at last. You’ve been extremely helpful, Mr. Coleson!”

   “Please, just Brad!” He assured me. “Honestly, I’m just glad to see a familiar face. Hell of a blast from the past, kiddo. Always knew you’d make something of yourself.”

For some reason those words killed the polite smile on my face.

   “Yeah…” I said quietly. “Yeah, well I tried.”

He reached over to pat me on the shoulder.

   “Oh, which reminds me, if you two have a moment, I’ve got some coconut cream pie here. I think you two kids could use a slice! Sound good?”

I gave a heavy nod that he only superficially acknowledged before he got up again.

\*\*\*

As Oak and I left, she was casually sipping from the soda-for-the-road that he’d given her.   

   “Damn… what are the odds we’d run into one of your high school teachers out here?” She asked. “I mean that’s wild, right?”

   “Yeah…” I said quietly as we walked to the car.

Oak checked her phone.

   “No word from Nathan yet. Guess he’s still tied up with his lead.”

   “That’s great,” I said absentmindedly. “What about Lucas?”

   “Still at the hotel. You wanna meet up with him or…?”

   “Sure.”

She paused, staring at me for a moment. Unlike Coleson she saw I wasn’t doing great.

   “You’re in a mood,” She said.

I didn’t deny it. I just got in the car and waited for her to join me. 

   “What’s on your mind?” She asked.

   “This job… doesn’t this feel fishy to you?” I asked. “Look at the last three. Actual *monsters.* Then suddenly we’re in Canada looking into some missing girl.”

Oak shifted uneasily in her seat.

   “I mean, going by the briefing she’s not *entirely* a girl anymore…” She said but there was absolutely no conviction in her voice.

The briefing had mentioned that June Walker wasn’t entirely human anymore.

[   “Her arms were… mutated, after exposure to a unique compound,”](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/fc75rx/compiled_notes_on_the_athena_project/) Lucas had said. *“Elastic, clawed. More akin to tentacles at this point. Keep her at a distance. Odds are she’ll close it fast and if her children are present, expect extreme aggression.”*

   “A girl,” I repeated and smoothed down my hair. “And her children. Gee, wonder why *they* wanted to escape a lab.”

Oak bit her lip.

   “I thought we were supposed to be protecting people from monsters?” I asked. “Who the hell are we protecting by running after some kid they mutated and putting her back in a lab? I mean Christ, we don’t even have a trail of bodies or attacks. She’s not hostile, she’s hiding! Is this what we do now?”

Oak finally spoke.

   “Feels more like a cleanup…” She said, “Or a salvage op, I guess. I mean… you’ve been thinking it too, right?”

I nodded.

She sighed and rubbed her temples.

   “Look I mean… it makes *some* sense to me I guess, wanting to try and capture these goddamn things alive. Study what went right, what went wrong. Maybe salvage a bunch of old projects that didn’t really work out… I mean, that’s where these things came from, right? Good intentions and all that. But Lucas and Parsons keep pushing that we *need* them alive. And then this…”

   “I’m still not sure what good keeping these things alive is going to do,” I said. “Far as I’m concerned they’re living proof that whatever the people who made them were trying to do wasn’t going to work… and I’m sorry, but how the fuck does a project go so wrong as to create things like *that.* Mutated clones of Tom Hanks, disembodied brains, skull faced monsters. That doesn’t just *happen!* You need to be knocking on a *very* particular door there.”

   “Or you need a common denominator…” Oak said softly. Her voice had gone a bit lower.

   “What do you mean?”

   “Just saying. You… uh… remember that notebook I found a few weeks ago? Back in Vermont?”

I paused. I remembered seeing it in her pocket on the boat as we’d left the island.

   “Can’t say I could make heads or tails out of West’s research… but she mentioned that the IPD had provided her with something to help streamline her process. I dunno exactly what it was but she called it the Athena Compound.”

Athena.

I’d heard that name before. Nathan had mentioned something similar when he’d been trying to collect a blood sample off of the last target.

   “She say anything else?” I asked.

   “A little… as far as I can tell, she only barely understood this stuff. Doesn’t seem like it behaves in a way that’s in line with anything else on earth. The long and short of it is, it induces mutations which can be controlled through splicing it with the stem cells of other organisms.”

That description sounded a little familiar.

I remembered something Parsons had said to me when he’d sent me to look into the Tom Hanks creature.

   *‘They didn’t realize that some of the samples they’d been using had been modified by the team who had originally procured them. Apparently their predecessors were trying to cut corners by genetically modifying the samples….’*

I wondered if they’d used Athena there too. I looked over at Oak, and wondered if she’d come to the same conclusion.

   “That mention of Mutation gets me thinking about this June Walker girl too… I mean… could be she was exposed to Athena as well, hence the tentacle arms. It tracks with the other things as well.”

I nodded.

   “You think that’s what Parsons is after?” I asked. “Digging into the old failed applications of Athena?”

   “Maybe.” She said. “Although I guess it depends on your definition of failure.”

I knew she was thinking about the ventilation system back at the Burlington lab.

I was too.

If they’d had access to that, why hadn’t they used it? Why hadn’t they killed the creature back then?

Unless of course they *hadn’t* had access to it.

Why else would one hide a failsafe that could save lives behind a hidden panel? 

Why had Nathan known about it? Why did he have a key? If this was standard in all IPD facilities, why wasn’t it used to kill the Tom Hanks clone, who’d apparently caused just as much carnage during its escape. 

I didn’t like these questions.

I didn’t like them one goddamn bit.

\*\*\*

   “Well friends, meet [Dr. Brian Warren…](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/g29mu1/the_pigeon_girl/)” Nathan said as he sat over the laptop in our hotel room. He turned the screen so we could see it. On it was a picture of an older, bearded man who matched the description of the figure Coleson had mentioned.

   “Great. Do we know him?” Oak asked. She sat on the bed looking unimpressed. She glanced over at Lucas, who as per usual was sitting in a chair just listening. 

   “I managed to get some intel on him,” Nathan said. “Used to be an IPD scientist, working on a project back in the day. Telepathic animal control…”

He whistled. “He resigned over *ethical concerns.* Retired soon after. You said your witness saw him meeting with Walker?”

   “That’s the man he described,” I said. “He was pretty adamant that the girl we showed him was the one he saw too. It’s a solid ID.”

That seemed good enough for Nathan.

   “We’ll keep an eye on him,” Lucas said. “See if he’ll lead us to her… and if we’re lucky there may be others too. Sounds to me like the man’s a bleeding heart.”

   “Thought we were just focusing on Walker?” Oak asked.

   “She’s the priority but if there are others, we need to bring them in too. We can’t leave loose ends.”

   “With all due respect - do we have the resources to deal with others right now?” Oak asked.

   “You've got me,” Nathan said, looking back at us. “I'm all you need.”

He said it with confidence - but it didn't put me at ease.

\*\*\*

Following Dr. Warren felt… wrong.

This guy wasn’t exactly what I’d describe as a criminal mastermind. He was just an old man who spent most of his time in his apartment… and here we were, stalking him like he was John Gotti.

We’d bugged his phone and were taking shifts watching the building. Every time he made or received a phone call, we were listening. Every time he went out, we watched him as he did exciting things like buy groceries, walk around the park feeding pigeons and go to a diner for fish and chips. 

Riveting.Neither me or Oak said anything about it… it wasn’t worth the argument with Nathan, but I could see the discomfort on her face. 

We’d taken this job to hunt monsters, not stalk old men who might be at worst harboring a girl who probably had a good reason to hide.

This wasn't what we'd signed up for… was it?

I'll be honest, I don't have much to say on the time we spent watching Warren. It wasn't like staking out the other targets. There was no tension or anything. It was just following his uneventful daily comings and goings - what little there were. 

We watched him for the better part of a week with nothing to show for it. 

   “We'll give it time!” Nathan had said. “He's bound to show us something eventually! We just need to be patient is all!”

Oak and I weren't so sure… although I guess credit where it's due, Nathan wasn't wrong in the end.

It was 5 days after we started watching him that Dr. Warren finally did something worth talking about.

He left his apartment in the late afternoon on Sunday, got in his car and started driving out to the edge of town. 

We followed him of course, but I can't really say I was expecting anything to come of it. Odds are the big reveal was that he was going to see his chiropractor or something like that.

But no. 

This time he was headed to a more run down section of town. 

Most of the buildings we passed looked old. Not abandoned, but worn down… and the apartment complex he finally stopped at looked damn near abandoned.

It wasn't much to look at, as a glance. Only three storeys. Easy to miss. The garden out front was overgrown and the brickwork looked weathered. It didn't look completely dilapidated… I guess I could still see someone living there, but I would have been surprised.

Dr. Warren parked on the street out front before getting out of his car. He seemed antsy… he was looking around more. We had to drive past him just so it didn't look like we were following him and even then his eyes remained focused on our car. 

   “Park around the corner. We'll go around the back!” Nathan said. “This has to be it…” 

I did as he asked, although every ounce of common sense I had in my head told me to keep driving. 

Nathan was the first one out of the car, tranquilizer rifle in hand. Oak reluctantly followed him. We approached the back of the apartment slowly. There was a dumpster out back with a couple of bags of trash in it. Someone was clearly living there.

Nathan took a peek inside before moving on, studying the building as he circled it.

   “Second floor… Northwest apartment…” he said. “Someone's up there. Could be Warren.”

   “How can you tell?” Oak asked.

   “Window is open. I saw movement…”

He gestured for us to move forward and we did. 

For a moment it almost felt like I was back in the army again… I can't say it was a good feeling.

We rounded the front of the building. Nathan just broke the glass on the door with the butt of his gun and moved on like nothing was wrong. 

There were a few closed apartments on either side of us, and a stairwell leading up to the second floor. Nathan looked around before starting up the stairs.

The apartment we were targeting was the first door on the right. 

   “Get ready to breach…” Nathan said quietly. Oak hesitantly nodded before taking up a position. Nathan up a position on the other side, before looking over at me. The expectation was clear. Out of the three of us, I was the biggest. I would have the easiest time forcing the door open. 

I took a deep breath before bracing myself.

I hoped like hell that nobody would be in there… but somewhere in my gut, I knew better.

I kicked open the door. It flew open with a thud. 

I saw Dr. Warren immediately. He was seated at the kitchen table of the small but tidy apartment… and I could see two other women with him.

The first was a young woman in her twenties. She had short brown hair covered by a newsboy cap, sun kissed skin and freckles. A heavy overcoat was draped over her shoulders, hiding her arms… but I knew who she was immediately.

June Walker. 

We’d really found her.

The second woman was roughly the same age as her. She was paler with long black hair, a black jacket and a tee shirt for a band I didn’t recognize. 

Both of them masked their surprise at the sudden intrusion quickly. June’s expression curled into a look of utter rage. A pair of twisted grayish tendrils emerged from her sleeves, each one tipped with a sharpened beak-like claw that split into three bladed segments as it opened. 

One tendril launched itself at me and I only barely got out of the way in time. 

The dark haired girl made an abrupt gesture toward us, almost as if she were throwing something… and something definitely came across the room at us.

A crow.

No.

*Several goddamn crows.*

They must have been in the room already, and they mobbed Oak and Nathan before either of them could raise their rifles to try and get a shot. 

June took advantage of the distraction, grabbing Oak with one of her clawed tendrils and hurling her across the room.

   *“Warren, get the kids!”* She snapped.

Warren didn’t need to be told twice. He stumbled toward the back of the apartment, as June and her parter focused her attention on me next.

I could only throw up my hands to try and swat away the crows swarming me. I couldn’t protect myself against June. I felt one claw snake around my leg and she lifted me effortlessly off the ground before slamming me into the table that Dr. Warren had been at moments ago. It broke under the impact. 

From the corner Nathan was still trying to get a shot off. He swatted one of the crows out of the air and fired his tranq rifle at the other woman. Another crow took the dart for her… and I saw her grimace in rage.

Every single crow in that goddamn room mobbed Nathan, and he tried to close the distance between the two of them, sprinting at the dark haired girl to try and tackle her to the ground. He almost made it… June only barely stopped him.

A tentacle seized him and pinned him to the wall.

   *“Is it too much to ask for you to leave us alone!”* She snarled.

Nathan didn’t reply. Without missing a beat, he pulled a combat knife from his belt and drove it into the tentacle that kept him pinned.

Grace let out a cry of pain and Nathan seized his window of opportunity.He had a shot.

He took it.

He should have hit her. He was too close to miss.

But the dart was nowhere to be seen. June flinched, before realizing that she hadn’t been hit.

That was when I noticed the smell.

I’d finally been trying to pick myself up and rejoin the fight when I noticed it.

Burnt ozone. 

The same thing I’d smelled in Vermont and Arizona.

Nathan seemed confused… he stared down at his rifle, then back at June. It passed quickly. He took aim again, but he never got the chance to shoot.

Something else hit him first.

One moment he was just standing there, then there was a sudden flash of light - like a bug hitting a bug zapper - and Nathan was slumped against the wall, completely unconscious. 

I saw Oak lying on the ground nearby as well. Had she been knocked out when June had hit her, or was that related to whatever had taken Nathan down?

I didn’t have time to think about it. Both June and her partner were looking at me now. I grabbed for my gun but there was another flash of light, accompanied by a deafening pop. 

My gun dissolved on the floor… and I mean, *literally* dissolved!

One moment it was there and the next, there were just ashes, drifting through the air.

I froze.

June and her friend were silent, as if they knew what was here. Their eyes reminded trained on me, as if they were waiting to see what would happen.

I opened my mouth to speak before…

There was another flash of light. 

And then I was gone.

\*\*\*

   *“Order for Jeremy!”*

I blinked.

I was in a coffee shop… not one I recognized, although I did recognize the street outside the window. That was the main street of Tevam Sound. The apartment was only about fifteen minutes away. But how the hell did I get here? What the hell was this?

That burnt ozone smell lingered at the edge of my senses…

I blinked again before noticing the woman sitting across from me, holding a cup of mocha and taking a long, slow, deliberate sip. She let out a contented exhale, before setting her cup down on the saucer. 

   “Mr. Mallory…” She said softly. “What a mess you’ve gotten into.”Her voice was calm and a little raspy. She looked vaguely familiar, but I wasn’t sure where I’d seen her before… her skin was pale, almost unnaturally so. Her hair was cropped into a short but plain bob cut. She wore wire rimmed glasses and a black turtleneck. 

   “W-what the hell?” Was all I could think to ask. “Where are we? How did I… *what the fuck?!”*

   “Relax, Mr. Mallory,” The woman said. “Your order should be ready in a mo-”

   *“Order for Daniel!”*

I looked over as the barista called my name, then looked back at the mysterious woman across from me. She gestured for me to go up… so that’s exactly what I did.

   “One large coffee, half and half and a chocolate brownie?” The barista asked.

I hesitantly nodded before taking it and looking back toward the woman. She gestured to the seat across from her, so I sat down again.

   “The coffee here is good,” She said. “The brownies are a little too rich for my liking, but my wife enjoys them. I imagine you will too.”

I stared down at the brownie.

   “Um… thanks?” I said.

   “You’re very welcome, Mr. Mallory.”

I hesitated for a moment before finally asking the inevitable question.

   “Who are you…?”

   “Just a concerned party,” She replied plainly. “Dr. Madison Carson. I used to work with the IPD. I’ve been keeping an eye on your little project… I have to say, I don’t entirely approve. While I’m happy to see some of the IPDs mistakes taken off the board, I can’t say I’m happy about who’s doing the cleanup.”

   “What’s that supposed to mean?” I asked.

   “Oh come now. You know exactly what I’m talking about. It’s the only reason we’re having this conversation and frankly, the only reason you’re still alive…”

My heart skipped a beat. She said those words so casually, and took another sip of her mocha.  

   “I know about the doubt, the tedium, the uncertainty. You signed on thinking this was a good idea, didn't you? You were thinking you could do some good, get rid of some monsters floating around out there, tie up some dangerous loose ends left by careless, stupid people… that's not a goal without any merrit. But that's not what this is anymore, is it? And you're starting to wonder if that's ever what it was. Little tin soldier, doing what he’s told, standing for nothing… did it ever occur to you that you’re less alive than the things you’re hunting?”

   “They’re dangerous,” I said but I knew there was no conviction in my voice.

   “Everything dangerous,” Dr. Carson replied. “Tease a cat and it’ll scratch. Does that mean you should shoot the cat?”

I didn’t have a reply for that.

   “The first few targets? I’ll agree, they needed to be dealt with. But June and Grace?” She shook her head. “That I can’t allow. They’re really a lovely couple once you get to know them… a shame I’ll have to relocate them after this, but they knew it was bound to happen eventually, I suppose. That’s not my biggest problem right now. Right now, my biggest problem is you.”

   “So what, are you gonna kill me?” I asked.

   “I would prefer not to,” She replied. “I don’t think it’s right to kill. Sometimes it just can’t be helped… sometimes it's necessary, but I like to avoid it where I can. You seem like a fairly reasonable man, Daniel - may I call you Daniel? You seem like someone who I can sit down and hold a rational conversation with. Am I right?”

I didn’t answer, but I think my body language said enough. 

   “I understand you’re just doing the job they hired you for,” Dr. Carson continued. “And I don’t hold whatever the IPD and Parsons are up to against you. But you and I both know that nothing good is going to come out of chasing down former victims who just want to live their lives in peace. June Walker for instance.”

I shifted uneasily in my seat. 

   “The job is the job,” I said.

   “I understand that. But believe me when I tell you, that that kind of mindset will hurt you more than it will help you in the long run… *ask me how I know…”*

As she spoke, I could smell that familiar burnt ozone smell. Dr. Carson looked a few shades paler suddenly. I could see cracks along her skin like broken porcelain, and some sort of blackened, burning liquid dribbling… it was as if her body was completely coming undone, and then…

Nothing.

Whatever had happened to her, it just… stopped.

She exhaled and took another sip of her coffee.

   “W-what the fuck was that?” I demanded. 

   “*That* is what happens when you do what the IPD tells you to do,” She replied coolly. 

   “What the hell are you?”

   “I honestly don’t know. Alive? Dead? Something in between? Do I exist? Do I not? I’ve never really found a satisfying answer. I simply *Am.”*

   “That lightshow back at the apartment? That was all you, then? Teleporting me here, *you can just do that?”*

   “Don’t worry, I didn’t harm your associates,” She said. “That was about as vulgar a display of power as I’m comfortable with… which isn’t to say I *can’t* do more. I simply don’t *want* to.”

She took another sip of her coffee.

   “Look, I’m not trying to intimidate you, Daniel. I just want you to stop for a moment and think critically. You already know that there is no valid reason to target June and her family. You know that Parsons isn’t exactly trustworthy… if he was, he’d have euthanized those last two creatures. I’m not telling you anything you don’t already know. I’m just giving you the option to choose for yourself, without Parsons inane little errand boy to push you around.”

   “Option to choose?” I repeated. “Nathan’s not exactly gonna accept that…”

   “Which is why I’m not asking Nathan, I’m asking you. Here’s what’s going to happen… within the next hour, that building will be engulfed in a fairly large fire. Tragic, I know. Fortunately it’s abandoned. No official casualties… but unofficially? Five dead. June, Grace, June’s two adorable children and Dr. Brian Warren. All five burnt to ashes. No bodies to recover… only the eyewitness testimony of one man.”

I paused for a moment.

   “You want me to lie?” I asked.

Dr. Carson took another sip of her coffee.

I sighed. I stared down at my own untouched coffee and the chocolate brownie. After a moment, I took a sip of the coffee.

It really was good.

   “How did the fire start?” I asked.

   “June ripped the stove out of the wall. It was gas. There was a spark. She died instantly. The bird girl was disoriented by the fire. You lost track of her. You were more focused on your associates. You put Oak on your back and dragged Nathan down the stairs. You only barely got out. You never saw Warren or the kids, but you heard the screams.”

I nodded.

   “Okay… say I do this… say they buy it… you know we’ll just be sent on to the next target, right? I don’t know what it’s gonna be.”

   “We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it,” Dr. Carson said. “All I need to know, is are you in or are you out?”

I didn’t even need to think about my response, not really.

   “It’s a shame,” I said. I took a bite of the brownie. It was rich… it was delicious. “June Walker deserved a better life than that… dying unceremoniously in a fire like that… hell of  way to go out.”

   “Oh, I’m sure you and you’ll cry crocodile tears,” Dr. Carson replied. She offered me a hand to shake.

I stared at it before reluctantly taking it. Her grip sent a chill through me.

   “I’m so glad you were willing to talk this through,” She said, although there was a hidden threat in her tone.

I chose not to think about it.

I took another sip of my coffee and I ate my brownie.

Gotta say… it was a hell of a lot better than anything else I could’ve been doing at that moment.

\*\*\*

The apartment was burning.

I stood in front of it, the taste of coffee and chocolate still on my tongue. 

The fire had spread quickly… the building was almost completely engulfed.

Oak and Nathan lay at my feet. I could see Oak starting to stir, but Nathan wasn’t moving yet.

I ignored him and helped Oak to her feet.

   “What happened…?” She groaned.

   “Gas leak,” I said. “Walker hit the stove during the fight… we barely got out.”

   “Shit… what about Walker?”

   “Dead… same with all the rest.”

Oak grimaced, but looked over at the burning building.

I heard Nathan starting to wake up beside me and got ready for him to ask the exact same question.

Somehow I already knew he’d buy it.

I wish I could say that I felt bad lying to him… but no.

No… this was the way it had to be.",1,1753424059.0,HeadOfSpectre,0,1.0,False
1m8rnqn,https://i.redd.it/ksk6s5xopyef1.png,My First Epoxy and Wood Tray – A Fun Learning Experience,"I always enjoyed watching videos about resin art so one day I thought I would try it for myself. The tray is my first project combining wood and epoxy. I used a piece of acacia wood and cut a river shape through the middle. Then I made some clear white epoxy resin and added some gold leaf flakes to give it some shimmer.

I loved the pouring part, while also being a bit nervous. I had fears of bubbles, and uneven flow, but I simply took my time. I let the entire tray cure for a full day. Once I knew the epoxy was fully hard, I sanded everything down and polished the surface.

The addition of the black handles made it functional and beautiful. I now use it to serve coffee or snacks, and it never fails to get attention from my family and friends.

This project taught me so much about having patience and how epoxy works. I still have a lot more to learn- especially to avoid little air bubbles, but I am proud of this first try.

For anyone thinking about doing a resin project, I say go for it! Just take your time and make sure to wear safety equipment. It’s a fun and creative process.

I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

1m8rn71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1m8rn71/trying_to_lose_weight/,Trying to lose weight,I’ve had a lifelong issue with trying to lose weight and keep it off. I made some progress several years ago before I had my first seizure in 2022. As I’ve gotten older it has been harder to keep the weight from coming back and much harder to actively lose weight. One of my strategies used to be to wake up and drink a ton of black coffee and avoid eating as long as possible (intermittent fasting kinda) then trying to stick with low/no carb as much as possible.  Since having my second seizure this past March I have officially had to give up my black coffee and I am on a med now (trileptal). I am struggling so bad with my weight and it is really starting a depressive state as I am so unhappy with my body. It doesn’t help that it seems that so many people in my daily life are on some type of glp1 med and dropping weight so fast. Has anyone here had success with taking glp1s and not having it affect your epilepsy? I am concerned it may cause me to have more seizures etc. ,1,1753423970.0,Epilepsy,0,1.0,False

I screamed as my pup was brutally ripped from my belly by my Alpha mate","NO!!"" I screamed as my pup was brutally ripped from my belly by my Alpha mate, who believed my stepsister's lie about my betrayal.

I died in hatred, but when I woke, I was reborn.

Laughing through tears, I swore, ""You two will pay for your sins!""

""Please don't do this."" I begged over and over, but no one was listening. ""I am your luna."" I screamed at the top of my lungs, but then his laugh from the other room broke all the fight in me. 

""Luke please."" I begged once more time, my voice horse.

""Take it once it's done. Toss her out. She will have to survive on her own from here on out.""

He can't mean that. This was our baby.

""Is a mistake from the Moon Goddess. One I will rectify."" His voice called again from the other room. He wouldn't even face me. ""Now do it. That's a command.""

""Yes, Alpha.""

""Oh, and doctor?"" Her sweet voice called from the other room. My stepsister, Shannon. I gritted my teeth. ""Don't use any anesthetic. She should feel everything.""

""Yes, Luna."" The doctor turned back to me with sad eyes, but when he picked up the scalpel, I knew I was screwed.

I'm sorry, baby. Momma couldn't save you. I tried to rub my stomach, but the nurses had strapped me down. When the doctor approached, I realized he was using a silver blade.

""Silver?"" My whisper was almost silent, but he nodded. I knew then that Shannon didn't want me to survive. She wanted my life so badly that she lied about me cheating on my mate, showing photos as proof. 

I cried silently as the doctor cut into my abdomen, and I felt my baby thrash inside. He knew it was too early to be born. This was a death sentence for both of us.

""Bring me the body of the pup.""

""Yes Alpha."" 

I felt every slice as he cut into me, and finally I could take it no longer. I thrashed against the restraints. But the silver had made me weak.

""Doctor, now.""

""Yes Alpha."" The doctor picked the baby up and rushed out, leaving me spread open to the elements.

I felt my life slipping away as the door opened and Shannon came in. Her smug smile was firmly in place.

""I told you I would take your life, Amy. I would have your mate. "" Shannon walked over and laid a kiss on my face as I snarled. ""He is perfection. And don't worry. I will give him another son."" She laid her hand on her stomach and I started to laugh. ""What's so funny?""

""I can smell the beta on you. That's Derek's child, and it's a girl. Nice try though.""

She snarled and raised her hand, growing her claws to deliver the final blow, but the door was ripped open and my mate, the man I now hated most in the world, stepped inside. His eyes were red, and I started to laugh again.

""You runt!"" He snarled and struck out, whipping Shannon to the other side of the room.

""Brandon!"" Shannon shrieked as she hit the wall. ""What's wrong?"" She staggered to her feet, but more blood dripped out of me and I closed my eyes.

""You lied!"" He screamed, shaking the walls as his aura struck out, but I could barely feel it. I felt the silver travelling in my veins getting closer to my sluggish heart. ""This was my pup. I can smell me on him."" Brandon's eyes grew redder as the tears gathered. ""She did cheat on you. I guess I was wrong about the pup.""

""You said you smelt it."" From the sound of it, he lunged for her again, but him clutching our baby in his arm was the last thing I saw. And I wanted to never see it again. He did this to us. Not Shannon.

She played her part well, sure, but him not believing me, not waiting for a few more days to smell the pup, that was his fault. And all of our downfalls.

I prayed for the moon goddess to take me. I no longer wanted to be here. I wanted to be with my pup.

""Save her.""

""No!"" Shannon screamed. ""I am the Luna now, you marked me last night."" Ah, so that was the pain I felt last night. 

I cracked my eyes to see my mate, Brandon, hovering next to me. ""Stay with me Amy.""

""No!"" I slammed out, putting all of my power in it. 

Brandon looked down at me, pleading. ""Let me save you.""

""I am descended from the Moon Goddess, and you don't deserve to save me. You don't deserve our pup. You were weak. And now you lost everything."" I smiled up at him as I felt my life from my body.



Chapter Two

I opened my eyes to find myself surprisingly alive. ""Amy hurry, you're going to be late."" I jolted up and look around, confused. What was going on? Where was I? ""Amy!"" The voice called again and I shook myself. I stood up from the bed and looked around again. I recognized this room. It was my childhood bedroom.

I hadn't stepped foot in this room since I found my mate, Brandon. I heard a knock on the door and my mother opened it. Before I could process what was happening, I ran into my mother's arms. ""Mom, you're here."" I started to cry. ""I've missed you so much.""

""Amy. My girl."" She laughed as she patted my back. ""I saw you yesterday."" She pulled back and I looked into her amber eyes that matched my own. ""Happy birthday, baby.""

I leaned into her hands and realized that today was the last day I spent at home. I found my mate on my eighteenth birthday. ""Thank you, mom.""

""Hopefully, you will meet your mate today and start your new life."" She smiled at me and I felt my blood freeze. I didn't want to meet Brandon. Not when I knew what was going to happen.

""I'd rather stay here with you."" I smiled as I kissed her cheek. ""I don't want to miss you and Morgan.

And I knew that when Brandon thought I cheated on him, before he treated my baby and me like that. He also did the same to my mother for her involvement. Shannon's father, my mother's husband, watched her die. 

""Baby. You won't miss us. We will be there every step of the way."" She kissed my cheek, and I wrapped my fingers around hers.

""Mom, can we just leave? You and me? Leave Shannon and Morgan and move back to daddy's pack?"" My father, the Alpha of the Silvermoon pack, wasn't a good husband, but he was a good man. He cheated on my mother, betraying her when he was drunk. 

His betrayal cost the life of my brother growing inside of her, and she refused to move past it.

""No baby. I can't go back."" My mother's face fell as she turned away.

""I don't want to be betrayed, mom. Not like you and not any worse. I don't want a mate."" I whispered my new truth.

""What do you know?"" I watched as her eyes searched mine.

I pulled her back into my room and away from the door. ""I don't know for sure, but I am terrified that if I am mated to Shannon's boyfriend, I will die after we are mated. Mom, the chances that he will match with an Alpha far outweigh the chance that he is mated to the daughter of the beta."" I pulled back. ""I don't want this for me.""

She weighed my words, and I watched as she came to the same conclusion. ""Okay baby. But you can't leave. It would be too conspicuous. You will have to mask your scent whenever he is around.""

I tossed my hands in the air. ""How would I do that?""

""There is much you don't know that I would leave in the past but if you are sure..."" She trailed off and I just nodded my head. ""Then let me make a few calls. You don't have to go to school today.""

I lept back into her arms. ""Thank you, mom. I don't know what I would do without you.""

""I love you, baby. You will never be without me. That I can promise you."" She kissed my cheek and then left me alone in my room.

I ran to my phone and checked the date to make sure. It was twenty eighteen; I went back six years. Six years to the day that I met Brandon. I could relive everything, make better choices. I could live, and maybe this time around, so would my pup.

I went into my ensuite and jumped into the shower. No way was I going to face today, looking like I just crawled out of bed. I stood in side my closet in a towel trying to figure out what to wear when I heard my bedroom door open.

I was about to turn and call out to my mother, but I heard a soft step, which my mother wouldn't do. So I hid behind my winter coats and I waited.

""I'm telling you, if she is Brandon's mate, I'm going to destroy her.""

""You can't mean that, Shan."" The nasily voice of Megan, Shannon's best friend, came from the cell phone pressed to her ear.

""Of course I do. Brandon is mine.""

""Only because you put out. He was hoping Shannon would notice him.""

""You shut your mouth, Megan."" Shannon snarled and her eyes flashed. ""He's mine.""

""Whatever I gotta go,"" Megan called, and then the line went dead. A honk sounded from outside and Shannon was snatching something before I grabbed her hand.

""What do you think you're doing in my closet?""

""Amy?"" Shannon's mouth dropped out. I squeezed her hand until I heard a crack. Her scream was muffled by my hand.

""You're lucky I only broke one finger. You just threatened to destroy me. Didn't I hear that correctly? A beta's daughter threatening an alpha."" I tsked.

""I didn't do anything."" She snarled back at me as her hand reformed.

""Lie again and I will break all of your fingers and hold them while the bones heal."" I couldn't stop my grin as I felt her tremble. ""Did you threaten me?""

""Yes."" she screamed at me. ""You're going to take Brandon from me.""

""I don't want your pathetic alpha now or ever. Keep him."" I pushed her away. ""Now get out of my room before I change my mind about maiming you."" I turned back to my clothes and picked out low-rise jeans and a tank top.

""What is your problem?""

""You. Now leave."" I let my wolf come forward and my eyes flashed. I pushed my alpha command into my words and forcing her out of my room. Foolish girl. How dare she come into my room to take something of mine? My wolf growled lowly. This was our den. I shook myself and refocused. Closing the doors, I hopped back into bed, pulling out my phone. I tried to remember everything that happened in the last six years that could help me with my plan. Because make no mistake, Brandon and Shannon would pay.



Chapter Three 

""Pack your bags, Amy."" My mom came in, surprising me from the list I was making.

""What?"" I looked up. ""Why?""

""You are going to spend the summer with your father. I already got the approval from the Alpha."" Mom smiled down at me. ""Come on, baby. Pack your bag and get ready.""

I jumped to my feet and ran to my mom. ""I can go?""

""Just for the summer, baby, then you will be back here with me. I had to promise that you would be returning here.""

I pouted. ""Mom, I really don't want to be here."" I wanted to make them pay, but I wouldn't risk him finding me.

""It's okay baby, you will understand once you see your dad."" She patted my hair and kissed my cheek. ""Now get ready.""

""Okay mom."" I kissed her back then she left me alone. I grabbed my phone to lock it and then turned back to my closet. I packed my bag and then headed into my bathroom when I heard the downstairs door slam open.

""I knew it."" I heard Shannon scream down stairs. I ignored her as I grabbed everything from my bathroom and then I grabbed my laptop and chargers. I stuffed everything in to my backpack and headed downstairs.

""Shannon, why are you screaming?"" Morgan was at the table with his coffee, and my mom was running around when I pushed my suitcase into the room.

""I'm not Brandon's mate, daddy."" Shannon flew into the room and dove into his arms.

""How are you so sure?"" Morgan wrapped his arms around her, but I just snickered. She snapped her eyes to me and she flew at me.

""It's you."" Shannon tried to claw out my eyes. But I just sent her flying with a backhand.

""Amy!"" Morgan got to his feet but my mom tsked.

""Morgan, you can't yell ay Amy for protecting herself. Shan attacked her first."" My mom placed my breakfast on the table. ""Amy, come eat. You have a long day ahead.""

""Babe? Why does Amy have a suitcase?""

""She is going away for the summer. To her fathers."" My mother turned to me and opened her arms. ""Come baby. Come eat. The car is coming and you need to be ready to go.""

I walked over and sat down, and dug in.

""Why is she going to her dads?"" Morgan walked over to pick Shannon up.

""She wanted to spend the summer with her dads before college and who am I to say no?"" My mom smiled down at me and I smiled back at her. I didn't know what was going to happen this summer to protect me from Brandon finding out I was his mate, but I needed it. Whatever it was, I needed it.

""Yeah, my dad called me this morning and since I haven't seen him since Christmas break and when he offered to fly me out, I asked my mom."" I smiled sweetly over at Morgan, and Shannon smiled.

""You're leaving?"" Shannon stood up.

""Yup. I'll be gone the full summer."" I smirked over at her. ""But my room is locked, and it will stay that way."" My smile dropped away as I stared at her and used my alpha command.

""Amy!"" Morgan yelled out. ""You know you're not allowed to alpha command your step sister!""

""And I wouldn't have Morgan, if I hdn't found her in my room this morning, trying to take things out of my closet."" I turned and raised my eyebrow, daring her to try to lie.

""Is that true?"" Morgan looked down at Shannon and I just stared at her. I watch her open her mouth to deny it.

""I wouldn't lie. I'll just command you to tell the truth."" She screeched and stomped her foot.

""Yes!"" she screamed. ""Are you happy? Yes, I went into her closet to steal some clothes because I know she is Brandon's mate.""

""How?"" I threw up my hands, playing like I didn't know the truth. ""How could you possibly know that I am his mate? Neither of us has scented each other.""

""Because he scented you on me!"" Her voice was hitting a higher octave, and my ears were starting to hurt.

""Calm down. You're hurting everyone's ears and just explain yourself."" My mom sat next to me at the table, rubbing her head.

""Last month, Brandon turned eighteen, and I was wearing Amy's dress. He scented around me and said I smelt divine. But when I'm not wearing her clothes, he has zero interest in me."" Shannon pouted.

""So he likes the way I smell, doesn't mean we are mates."" I pointed out. Completely and utterly denouncing Brandon as a mate. If I didn't accept him, he would never be my mate anyway, and I would never accept him. That was the only thing I was sure of.

Brandon would be the last male I would ever touch this time around.

""Stop being obtuse Amy. We all know what it means when a wolf likes your smell."" Shannon started to cry and buried her head in her hands. ""He's the male I want, daddy. The only one I would ever accept. But he wants her."" She pointed to me.

I scoffed. ""I don't want your sloppy seconds, Shannon. Even if he was my mate, and I am not saying he is. It would be a cold day before I accepted him as a mate. I would take the Lycan King over Brandon."" I threw my head back and laughed when she gasped.

The Lycan king was the bogeyman of all wolves.

The last Lycan to exist and one who lives in the wild. It's said the only wolves that ever see his face are the council that oversees the packs.

But either way, I wasn't lying. I would take the King as a mate before I would even look in Brandon's vicinity.

""You're lying. He's the alpha.""

""And?""

""Everyone wants to be the luna.""

""Idiots want to be the luna."" I turned back and finished my food as Morgan calmed her down. My mom stood when she heard a horn.

""That's for you.""

I nodded as I stood and kissed my mother goodbye before I left.



Chapter Four

I slipped into the back of the car after putting my bags in the back and buckled in. I had barely takin a breath before I launched myself over the seats and into the driver's arms.

His laugh made my eyes prickle. ""Hey love bug.""

""Uncle Ronnie. I've missed you."" I climbed over the seats and sat up front. ""What are you doing here?"" Ronnie was my dad's beta. Not related, but he had been there for most of my life.

""You think I was going to let my cheeky niece come to pack lands alone? Not on your life.""

""Dad sent you?"" I laughed.

""Dad sent me. He is a worry wart your da."" He smiled over and laughed with me. ""As soon as your mom called, he sent me with the jet.""

""He didn't have to."" I just shook my head and buckled my seatbelt.

""Of course he did. He never gets to see you enough, and now you're sending in the summer. What's going on?"" My uncle looked at me and I just shook my head.

""I don't want to be here.""

""Why?""

I looked down at my hands that were twisted. ""I'm afraid that my mate is here and I don't want to be right. I figured if I ran away, I could push off the inevitability.""

""Why wouldn; t you want your mate?"" My uncle asked as he zipped down the highway toward the airport.

""I'll tell both you and dad, just not now."" My uncle looked over at me, searching my face and then nodding.

""Fine, but I want the full story.""

""You will get it, I swear."" I nodded back to the road. ""Now focus on driving so you don't ruin us."" I grabbed the wheel, swerving back into our own lane.

""Heck!"" Uncle Ronnie grabbed the wheel from me and focused back on the road. ""I just worry about you, pup."" I couldn't stop the laugh because wolves stopped aging at twenty-five, and he looked barely older than me.

""I know you do."" I settled back into my seat and sighed. ""I promise, what happened isn't going to make that feeling any better."" I wiped at my face. ""I don't even know why my mom is sending me to my dad. She just said that he could help me.""

""Well, let's hurry and get back so we can figure out what you need, Sugar."" My uncle hit the gas, and we ended up at the airport in no time.

We loaded my bags and headed up to the jet, settling in there. ""Close your eyes. You look like you barely slept today and we have a few hours."" My uncle patted my head before he sat across from me and opened his laptop.

""Work?""

""Work."" He nodded.

""This summer, can you teach me some stuff?"" A plan was forming in my mind, a plan not only to keep myself away from my pathetic mate, but one that would make me a lot of money.

""Of course, Sugar."" My uncle smiled up at me. ""You know, your dad would teach you just about everything he could if you were open to it.""

""I asked to move to your pack."" I snuggled into the blanket the flight attendant handed me, and Ronnie froze.

""What is going on?"" His eyes flashed.

""I'll explain later. Just promise you will try to believe me and not judge me.""

""Of course, Sugar."" He smiled and then turned back to the laptop on his lap. ""Now get some sleep.""

""Will do."" I turned away and fell asleep almost instantly.

I woke up to Ronnie shaking me. ""We are here.""

I gave an enormous yawn and cracked my jaw before wiping my eyes. ""Okay."" I handed off the blanket and wiped my face again. ""Thank you.""

""No problem, Princess."" The flight attendant smiled down at me, and I realized belatedly that she was from the pack too.

""You don't have to call me Princess.""

""You are the Alpha's daughter."" She bowed and then left us to our own devices.

""Come on, your dad has already linked me three times since landing."" Ronnie laughed and whisked me off to the waiting car. With in thirty minutes we were at our pack lands. ""You dad would allow you to move here if you wanted to, Sugar.""

""I know. But Alpha Dan won't allow me to leave..."" I looked over and blew out a breath. ""I think he assumes something I am running from and won't let me leave until he knows for sure.""

""You going to tell me yet, Sugar.""

I hesitated as we pulled up out front of the pack house. Before I could answer the door was ripped open and I was surrounded by powerful arms and a smell that made my quaking insides settle.

""Dad.""

""Hey my pup."" His deep voice calmed me further, and I could feel my eyes prickle.

""I've missed you."" I sniffled as he unbuckled my seat belt and I was in his arms fully.

""As I have missed you."" He kissed my temple. ""Now we have much to discuss."" He was running with me before I could utter another word, with Ronnie following behind.

""Slow down, jack ass. Some of us can't move that fast."" Ronnie struggled to keep up and my laughter filled the halls of the pack house. We settled in my father's office with an out of breath Ronnie, who was scowling. God, I missed these two.

""Tell me what's wrong, pup."" I looked around and still I stumbled over my words. My father grabbed my face and shook his head. ""Nothing you tell me will change anything, pup. I believe you, no matter how crazy it seems.""

""Agreed Sugar.""

My insides settled when I saw how resolute he was. He would believe my craziness. I could tell no matter how crazy my story was, my father and Ronnie would believe everything I said.

I never had to second guess if I was going crazy here.

So finally I settled fully and told my story.



Chapter Five

""I lived another life, and I died."" I stumbled over my words and I felt my father freeze. A quick look to Ronnie had him locking the door and waving his hands. I felt the air still, but I was focused on my father's eyes. ""This morning I woke up six years in the past after living until I was twenty-four, and growing my own pup only to have my mate to rip him from my body.""

My father's and Ronnie's snarl shook the walls, but I raised my hands. ""He betrays me for my step sister who convinced him that I cheated and the pup wasn't his, so he brought death to us both using silver scalpels, and burying any love I had for him at the same time."" I looked up at my father and the tears rolled down my face.

""Pup."" His voice was choked up, but I raised my hand.

""I don't want him to be my mate, daddy. I know I won't survive it. I need to change it. Everything, and it starts with hiding my scent. I told mom what I needed, and she called you. How are you going to help me?"" I was starting to panic. ""I don't want to die. I don't want my pup ripped from my stomach only for him to smell himself on him. I don't want to create life just to have it ripped from me daddy. I can't."" My soul was ripping and even though I want revenge, this was the first time I was given to truly grieve the lost of my pup.

""Sugar."" Ronnie's voice was barely a whisper and then I felt my father lose control.

""Who?"" His voice was pure darkness. His fist slammed into the desk, creaking the thick wood, and I looked up to find my father's wolf looking back at me. ""Who hurt you, my pup? Who did those my grand pup?"" Loki's voice was deeper than I had ever heard and his eyes promised retribution.

""Brandon, the alpha's son."" I whispered the final piece and everything seemed to click. The air rushed back in and my father's wolf shifted into his black form. I screamed and Ronnie dove in front of the door.

Loki snarled, but Ronnie held firm. ""You can't go for him for something that hasn't come to pass yet, Loki. You know how this works. You have been through it yourself."" But Loki just snarled.

""Daddy, please."" I begged. I knew if he got out, Brandon and Shannon were dead and the council would be on his doorstop. Loki whirled on me and softened at the devastation he saw on my face. He padded over and licked the tears from my face before going back behind the desk and shifting again.

""I'm sorry Amy, I lost myself for a moment."" He opened a door and slipped into some shorts. He wiped at his face before he sat back down. ""I guess its our turn to come clean.""

""Daddy?"" I sniffled and looked up at him.

""I'm not just a wolf, although, as you can see, Loki is very much a part of me."" His laughter was weak, but I just smiled. ""My mother was a shaman of our people, a witch, and my father had to have her. Even if it was just for a night. And I was born.""

""A witch?"" I dropped my hands, and he just had a small, sad smile.

""Yeah. You would have loved her, but witches don't live like us. They have the lifespan of a human, a flash in the pan. She was gone long before I met your mother."" He shook his head. ""One of her powers was exactly what you explained, a second chance. The moon goddess passed us down with the same powers. I had mine when I was your age as well.""

I jolted back as he nodded. ""What?""

""I never cheated on your mother."" His words were soft. ""I alpha commanded a wolf to pretend I did when she came to me and told me she was with pup. You see, in my first life, I stayed with her and we had three wonderful pups, but one night, my enemies attacked and the four of your were all murdered.""

Sorry wrong script, ahem let’s try this again…

Hello and welcome farmers, in a galax….nope, in a farm not so far away, we have landed ourselves into mid-game! It is now time to learn our mid-game changes;

- shops
- Crop/Animal/Trees/Fish/Flower unlocks
- Auto tractor
- Some settings (pertaining to tractor mostly)
- Terraforming
- Expansions
- Farm remodeling
- Farmhands
- Player Permissions
- Buildings
- House’s and more details on the placeable’s

So Farmers this is gonna be a long and lengthy ride, sit back, relax, grab a coffee and enjoy the harvest!

First we’re going to start off with what changes we’ll begin to make for our farms.
Going from the original post and size that we made for our grind area we’re now going to be doubling its size, and with coming of, doubling its size, we need to increase our garage level to compensate! We’ll want to get the garage to level 15 while we’re doing expansions and remodeling and around level 45 we’ll be boosting garage up to 20 so save up and start leveling. Which brings us to our first talk….

Shops;
     As you level you will begin unlocking more and more shops and as we should already have most of the food shops open by now and leveled to 3-5 we’re going to now want to upgrade them again all the way to 10-15 (your choice) this is going to be helpful for expanding your farms area.

This will include the;
- Warehouse, this will increase storage for all rss when leveled
- Farmhands Union, we’ll talk about that later
- Landscaping Agency, to unlock Terraforming 
- Carpenters Shop, allows for town customization 
- And other shops that will offer diamonds and ribbons for rss

At this point tho let’s stick to the shops that provide diamonds for basic rss, around farm level 55 you can buy the other shops if u have the extra funds

Crop/Animal/Trees/Fish/Flower unlocks;
     As you’ll have noticed as you leveled your farm you’ll have gained access to newer unlocks given to you from leveling the specific item, while some come from just leveling your farm, many come from leveling the previous items! If u wanna know when something unlocks u can look at the shadowed versions of the item in the shop to see what previous versions need for level to unlock that item, if u haven’t unlocked a previous item that it requires it will only have “???”, if u have the previous item it’ll tell you what the item is and what level it needs, if the previous item already has the level req. it will be grayed out instead of red

Auto Tractor and it’s settings;
     The auto tractor is a new feature and is quite useful for those who either don’t have a lot of time to farm or who want to have everything or some at once.
For tractor settings we have;
- water crops in auto tractor
You have Everything-Only crops-Only flowers-Nothing (this feature is only useful if you continue to water crops ahead of schedule by accident)

- Require crops to plow
This is only needed to be set to yeas early game when low on money

- Open shop in auto tractor
This setting allows you to look at your in game shop while the tractor is moving on its own (useful for changing crops on the fly without stopping or doing a quick check of something)

- Limit auto tractor speed
This setting mostly will take effect after garage 20, after garage 20 every few levels you will get an additional 5% speed boost while in auto mode! Change this setting to yes if u want to keep your tractor speed at normal speed at all times!

- Smooth auto tractor
This setting has an upside and a downside. 
The upside to this is that the tractor will slow down its harvest/plant/plow/water speed (for those who need it slower) and only work tiles of the same nature as itself such it will not plant until it moves to a tile that does not have a crop on it instead of the next tile beyond itself. 
The downside is that it will not work adjacent tiles that NOT of the same nature of the one you are currently on (Example; you tractor is currently driving on a crop tile that is fully watered and there is a crop to the left and right that has the water symbol for needing water, the tractor will not water those crops and you will need to drive onto those tiles to water them)(I personally tried using this setting and I didn’t like it)

If u have a specific settings question plz ask and I will respond, if more redditors would like a more in depth settings guide to FT2 plz say so and I will make and post a link under this

Terraforming your farm;
     This is a new feature here in FT2, this brings a lot of new ways for those of you keen on decor to design your farm how you would like it to look, let’s talk a bit about them!

The terrain change tiles that cost gold from grass to sidewalk are cosmetic changes only and do not affect your movement speed.
(These terrain changes above WILL NOT prevent crop placement on the tiles, plz keep this in mind)

The ramp, Slope and Hill are new and not new to FT! Not new as they were permanent fixtures in FT1, but New in the way that the player may not change them as they see fit (with cost of diamonds) while also mainly a cosmetic feature to provide depth to your farm there are 3 things you can do with these features;
- Ramps can be placed on any side of the hills AND you can place walkways on them as well as the sides of slopes (you couldn’t do this in FT1)

- Hills can act as a natural wall when using auto tractor incase u look away while using it

- Hills and slopes can be used when placing a water source (whether it be fish or terrain) on the edge of the hill or slope both above and below the edge to create a waterfall (just note that this will not connect to fishing spots together so it will create two separate actions) (also note that water terrain WILL trap your pet in its tile area, not sure why)
Also note at this time I have not found a height or depth limit to the hill and slope limits

Expansions;
     Now is the time to begin expanding your farm!
By now if u followed my first guide you should have quite the amount of diamonds and gold! 
Expand at your own play speed, if u can handle a large farm this early on begin expanding to a 5x5 farm (7x7 will be for end game after level 65), if you are still low on funds or still wanna take it slow then expand to a 3x3 farm! Along with expansions we have….

Farm remodeling;
     During your run to get to mid game you may have begun randomly placing what u need for quests around the farm wherever you had space so now that your expanding is the time to move around and clean up your farm for better efficiency! 

I myself like to design and decor my farm after expansions to give it a nice look before I start letting other farmers in to play around in my farm! Since they added in a 2 high hedge for FT2 I’ll also be making a hedge maze cuz…..y not!

I also like to design an area for animals that go together so only 1 feeding area needs to be used this is helpful when using a Farmhand (will explain them and their settings shortly) by having the last tile of the animals on the outskirts of the farmhands reach so they can feed but not Harvest all of them (although with farmhands new features this can be changed) however for me I like to keep the animals far and put trees for the farmhand to harvest within the inner area while also designing the area for the animals to look like a petting zoo!

Farmhands;
     Farmhands have had a major upgrade from FT1 that gives a lot more freedom, control and placement options for them. First let’s talk about the small changes with them then we’ll talk about their settings.

In FT1 Farmhands would start at a cost of 2 medals to place then would increase by a set amount for every one placed up to a max of 15.
In FT2 this has changed, you now need the Farmhand Union to gain access to Farmhands (this is available at farm level 40 for the cost of 50 ribbons), then for each farmhands to gain access to will come with each Union shop upgrade, however, the cost for farmhands this time around have become quite expensive. The second level for the union will cost 75 ribbons and increase in cost per level and there is still an additional 10 ribbon cost to place each farmhand on your farm so this will be slow!

In FT1 it costs 2 medals per Farmhand to restock them to have them work when their time is up, in FT2 it will now cost 4 ribbons per Farmhand on your farm to restock them! Restock = payment
However they now work for 4hrs instead of 2hrs

Now onto the good changes to Farmhands (u can change each individual farmhands settings separately by walking over to them and clicking on their stall;

- First setting is effective size range that the farmhands can manage from 1 space in all directions all the way up to 8 spaces in all directions (this was only 6 spaces in all directions in FT1 and could not be modified) this option can modify 1 tile in each direction 1 at a time

- Next setting will be position, there are 2, center and corner (FT1 was center only). This gives more freedom of placement to manager your farm so as to not have to have your farm revolve around the placement of the farmhand and can now have the farmhand revolve around the placement of your farm
- - center expands the area of the farmhand by up to 8 in each direction while
- - corner expands the area the farmhand covers up to 16 in 2 directions away from the farmhand

Player Permissions
In this section we’ll cover what permissions do and what u might consider. 

First there is 7 permission levels these are

- none, self explanatory 
- Custom, that will be explained in a bit

For the next five, each next level will also include each previous level with it,
- Harvest only

- Quests, can plant crops associated with active quests

- Plant, can plant anything in available open plots (aside from signs with arrow locations, in the building segment below)

- Build, can build anything, including addition plot plowing that wasn’t previously there

- Full, can do what you can do

There are 4 permission lists and we’ll go over each one;

- Friend permissions, this will affect your friends permission level only. If you trust your friends you can set this to full, this means ANYTHING you can do so they can even sell plots and buildings

- Guest permissions, this can ONLY be increased up to Plant level, however if placed in custom certain changes can be made

- Custom permissions, honestly this is best used with the, Security Booth (explained in buildings), in which u can have all guests set to a standard but have the booths area set to custom with these settings! Or vice versa, but I like booth set to custom better

- User Permissions, this is where u can see all players that have been to your farm’s permissions and u can individually change them so, don’t like a player that has been not following some rules, change only their permission to none, really like a player and how helpful they are but they aren’t on your friends list give them full, the possibilities are endless

Next section will cover farmhands permissions;

- First will be when it comes to crop placement (FT1 farmhands could only harvest and water). You have up to 4 different or same crops u can give permission for the farmhand to place, I haven’t experimented with this yet but I assume it’s either the order of placement as it will place crop #1 then after harvest place crop #2 then after 4 start at 1 again or it’s for different crop placements based on season, I’ve been more focused on writing this post in my spare time I haven’t had much time to experiment (so I’ll edit after I do)

- Next we have individual permissions for, Crops/Trees/Flowers/Animals/Fish.                While each of these have a harvest option others have different options such as feed or plant, some have water some don’t and all these permissions can be changed individually to allow or not allow the farmhand to do specific tasks

- last we have building permissions, this only has harvest and supply, u can change this to harvest only if u want to monitor when u wanna supply the building (not sure if this works on a house) I saved that for last to Segway into……

Buildings;
       Some buildings will be grouped together and some will be explained individually;
(Before choosing buildings to place some may req a choice of variant (color) before placing as some will not be able to be changed after placement (you’ll see this option next to sort at the bottom of the shop))
- For all yield buildings, these are placeable’s that take either Time or rss+time to produce a Yield of diamonds or 1 rss to get another rss along with farm xp 

- Next is Glow Sticks, these handy placeable’s allow you to color code an area for you (unlike other objects you must choose a color before purchase)

- Signs with arrows, these much like Farmhands can change area size and have up to 4 crops that can specifically be placed within its area of effect, however, it changes the behavior of the AoE to ONLY allow 1-4 of the specified 4 crops to b placed in its area by a player

- Security Booths, has an AoE (Area of Effect) that it covers (up to 18 in 2 directions) that forcibly changes permissions within its AoE for any (excludes full permissions) player(s)

- Feeders, these allow animals to stay fed longer, however, req a higher rss cost to fill than just placing food on ground

- Guestbook, this is actually in decorations but I wanted add it here, this allows players to sign, date and time when they were in your farm and leave a note on their thoughts of your farm

- Fuel depot, adds fuel to your tractor when interacted with

- Quick Travel Post, u can have a max of 45 (10 more than FT1) and allows u to open your map and instantly travel to specified locations on your farm that u have one of these. Each one will be numbered on your map so place carefully where u want them 

- Houses, there are currently 2 atm but they will add more in the future. These not only act as fast travel points but also have additional benefits which helps me Segway into…..

Houses and more on their placeable’s;
       With houses being an FT1 players most common way of making diamonds it seems the devs have decided to slowly add houses to the game which is respectable as they want players to enjoy coming back every day to play and not be rushing end-game. Now with that being said any farmer has a multitude of ways they can design their house to look how they want it to look, however, what most players will definitely be looking forward to is the addition fast travel spot AND the 4 placeable’s that go inside so let’s move onto those this will be the last thing discussed before the end of this post.
These 4 things are;
- Stove, up to 2 can be placed per house and provide a steady stream of diamonds for the low timeframe it takes, for 1 such item it takes 2x 3m, which means there are 2 stages to the dish that take 3minutes each for a total of 6minutes however it must be interacted with for each stage. Takes money and rss per stage

- Easel, like the stove, it takes money and rss. However, its timeframe is much higher as its first painting take 2x 12m but gives a higher Yield

- Piano, this is similar to the stove for timeframe, however, this will take diamonds and rss instead but gives high Yield like the Easel

- Workbench, New addition to FT, this will have you working on sculptures. This takes more diamonds and rss than the piano and gives a super high Yield with the first item to make a yield of 220 starting diamond yield at level 1, HOWEVER, it has a VERY high timeframe with the first sculpture starting at 4x 40m


Alright Farmers, that will be the entire Mid-game post, I just entered what I consider End-game so it will be awhile before I am able to make a post for that! 

As of Friday July 25th at 1:42am EST, as before, all the information I have provided is to be true, however, as updates and patches are made some changes may take place, if you notice a discrepancy before I’m able to edit plz make sure to comment and I will make sure to make the change, and also again if there is something missing from my list that absolutely should be here make a mention and I’ll copy paste your comment along with a callout to you!

I'm a freelancer working with EasyCatalog and InDesign, mostly focused on automating product catalogs.

I learned about InDesign automation and EasyCatalog abroad, and when I came back home I realised that most of the companies and design agencies weren't using any of the tools available to automate content creation and update it. So I opened my own business to provide this service.

In my case, I have few clients from different industries. I found a lot of companies with catalogs that are highly automatable, but most of them still do everything manually. Even I found some of them that have a PIM feeding their website or e-commerce and I could use the same API to feed InDesign. 

But there’s a lot of resistance to change their workflows, even when I show them numbers like: ""where you are using now 3 hours you will spend only 10 minutes, think on the anual save.""

It is quite frustrating to see how companies don't even give me the chance to show a demo while I see the designers doing extra hours.

I’d love to hear from your experiencies as I work on my own and I feel a bit isolated. 

Is hard to find clients on your country? did you find industries more opened to adquire new tools than others? Which is the toughest part of the business for you?

It's funny how sometimes, when you're not really searching for anything in particular, you stumble across something unexpectedly beautiful... like a bloom hidden beneath the leaves. 

This morning, in a moment of stillness, I sat sipping my coffee (my ritual cup of morning dew, if you will ☕), and it hit me. An overwhelming sense of joy whispered gently from the most unassuming corners of my mind. You know the kind of joy that doesn't make a scene, but instead, lingers quietly, waiting to be noticed amidst the clamor of daily routine.

This hidden bloom was gratitude, and in recognizing it, I realized how little attention I had been giving to the quotidian little things—the shared laughter with a friend, the warmth of sunlight on my skin, even the gentle discomfort of growing through life's challenges. 🌼

My garden’s always been a bit unruly, paths twisting in unexpected directions like life itself, but today I felt a renewed appreciation for its wildness.

1m8rdnw,https://i.redd.it/lqabu4ramyef1.png,How to be a perfect sugar daddy in Europe?,"Europe is home to elegance, romance, and sophistication — and being a sugar daddy in this vibrant continent is about far more than just money. It’s about charm, discretion, mutual respect, and knowing how to spoil the right woman (or man) in the right way. Whether you're in Paris, Milan, Amsterdam, or Prague, here’s your ultimate guide to becoming the ideal sugar daddy in Europe.

# 1. Understand the European Sugar Dating Culture

In Europe, sugar dating leans more toward class and companionship than flashy displays of wealth. Sugar babies often look for mentorship, emotional connection, and lifestyle enhancement, not just gifts. Countries like Germany, Sweden, and France value privacy, maturity, and clarity in relationships.

# 2. Be Transparent and Honest

Honesty is the foundation of any sugar arrangement. From the start, be clear about what you're looking for — whether it's a travel companion, someone to attend events with, or a more intimate arrangement. A perfect sugar daddy doesn't play games; he communicates with confidence and clarity.

# 3. Dress and Act Like a Gentleman

European sugar babies expect style and sophistication. Invest in tailored suits, polished shoes, and good grooming. Whether you’re sipping coffee in Vienna or cruising on the Côte d’Azur, your appearance should reflect success. But don’t forget manners — being respectful and well-spoken is even more attractive than a Rolex.

# 4. Know What Sugar Babies in Europe Want

European sugar babies are often educated, multilingual, and ambitious. They value experience over extravagance. They prefer cultural dates, meaningful conversations, and authentic attention over flashy shopping trips. Understanding and respecting their goals is a key trait of the perfect sugar daddy.

# 5. Be Financially Generous — But Not Flashy

A perfect European sugar daddy provides thoughtful, discreet support. Whether it’s covering tuition, helping with travel, or providing monthly allowances, generosity is key — but it should be appropriate and respectful. Discuss the arrangement early and make sure both sides feel comfortable.

# 6. Use the Right Platform

Avoid random dating apps or Discord chats. If you're serious, use high-quality platforms. This site connects verified, mature sugar daddies with genuine sugar babies across Europe. With advanced filters, location-based search, and privacy features, you’ll find someone who truly matches your lifestyle.

# 7. Respect Boundaries and Privacy

Europeans care deeply about privacy. Don’t pressure sugar babies to post public photos or disclose private details. Be the man who listens, who protects her identity, and who makes her feel safe. That’s what sets you apart from the rest.

# 8. Offer More Than Just Money

Be a mentor, a partner, a friend. Share your life experiences. Introduce her to your world — business events, cultural galas, fine dining. A perfect sugar daddy enriches his sugar baby's life beyond the wallet.

# 9. Embrace Classy Travel & Romance

Want to impress her? Invite her to a weekend in Lake Como, a jazz night in Prague, or a wine tasting in Bordeaux. Experiences beat expensive bags. It’s about creating memories that make her look forward to your next date.

# 10. Stay Loyal and Discreet

The perfect sugar daddy doesn’t brag. He doesn’t screenshot chats or tell friends. Loyalty, discretion, and class are your weapons of attraction. If she trusts you, she’ll open up — and that’s when the real connection begins.

""Elena... Elena, please."" Mara's voice crackled through the speaker, barely there. ""The whispers. They're back. In the walls, under the floors, they're—"" A wet gasp. ""Come home. Before it's too late.""

The message ended with a sound like fingernails dragging across wood.

Elena sat in her Chicago apartment, phone pressed to her ear, replaying the message. Outside, traffic hummed its midnight song. She hadn't spoken to her cousin in three years. Hadn't set foot in Hollow's End in seven.

She poured bourbon into last night's coffee mug, the ceramic still stained with lipstick. The burn helped her think. Mara had always been fragile—too many years alone in that rotting house, too many family ghosts whispering poison in her ears. But this was different. The terror in her voice felt raw, immediate.

By noon, Elena was driving south on I-57, watching cornfields blur past. The radio kept cutting to static. She'd packed light: three days' clothes, her laptop, the Glock 19 she'd bought after the third death threat from that pharmaceutical expose. The gun sat on the passenger seat, its dark color catching the light.

---

Hollow's End announced itself with a wall of fog that rose from the earth, thick and wrong. Elena slowed the rental car to a crawl, headlights barely penetrating the gray shroud. The town limit sign emerged from the murk: *Population 3,847*. Someone had spray-painted beneath it: *AND DROPPING*.

Main Street looked wrong. Not abandoned exactly, but holding its breath. The diner's neon sign flickered between ""OPEN"" and ""OMEN."" Jack-o'-lanterns grinned from porches, their carved faces already soft with rot though Halloween was still four days away.

She pulled into the gas station. The attendant—a kid maybe nineteen, acne scars and nervous eyes—topped off her tank without being asked.

""You're one of them Hargroves,"" he said. Not a question.

Elena handed him two twenties. ""Keep the change.""

""Your people's house..."" He glanced toward the east side of town where the old Victorian lurked. ""Folks been hearing things. My mom says—""

""Your mom says what?""

The kid's Adam's apple bobbed. ""Says the dead don't stay buried in that place.""

---

The Hargrove house squatted on Elm Street like a cancer. Three stories of peeling paint and broken promises, windows black as pulled teeth. Elena parked at the curb, clipped the Glock into the holster at her hip, and let her jacket fall over it.

*She was nine, watching from the stairs as her father pressed the shotgun under his chin. ""The whispers won't stop,"" he'd said, tears cutting tracks through three days of stubble. Her mother screaming. The wet sound that followed.*

Elena shook her head, forced herself back to now. The front door hung ajar.

""Mara?""

Her voice died in the foyer. Dust motes swirled in shafts of gray light. The house breathed around her—walls expanding, contracting, lungs full of mold. Family portraits lined the hallway, eyes following. Great-great-grandfather Silas Hargrove dominated the largest frame, his mouth a slash of disapproval.

In the kitchen, she found signs someone still lived here: dishes in the sink, a calendar marked with red X's counting down to Halloween. A pot of soup had boiled dry on the stove, bottom burned black.

""Mara, where the fuck are you?""

The basement door creaked open.

Elena's hand dropped to the Glock. She'd been down there once, at seven, playing hide-and-seek with cousins who'd all died young. The memory tasted like copper pennies.

She descended. Each step groaned a warning. At the bottom, candlelight flickered across stone walls. Mara knelt before something Elena couldn't quite see, rocking back and forth.

""Mara.""

Her cousin turned. In the wavering light, her face looked carved from wax. ""You got my message.""

""What's going on? What whispers?""

Mara laughed, brittle and sharp. ""You know. You've always known. It's in our blood, Elena. What Silas did. What we all carry.""

Behind Mara, Elena saw it now—an altar cobbled from old bones and rusted farm tools. At its center, a leather journal spotted with what might have been hundred-year-old blood.

""He fucked his own daughter,"" Mara whispered. ""Killed her when she got pregnant. Killed the baby. Killed his wife when she found out. Then hung himself from the oak in the yard. But he didn't stay dead. None of them did.""

The candles guttered. In the darkness between flickers, Elena glimpsed shapes moving in the corners. Heard whispers in a strange language.

""We have to burn it all,"" Elena said. ""The journal, the altar, everything.""

""Too late."" Mara's eyes caught the candlelight, two bright points in the dark. ""It's already started. Can't you feel it? The fog's not natural. It's spreading. And when it touches people..."" She trailed off, staring at something over Elena's shoulder.

Elena spun, gun raised. Nothing there but shadows and the smell of dirt.

When she turned back, Mara was gone. Just the altar remained, and the journal, and the whispers growing louder.

---

Elena burst from the house, gasping October air. The fog had thickened while she was inside, reducing visibility to maybe ten feet. She fumbled for her phone. No signal.

Sheriff's department. She'd start there, try to make sense of this shit.

The drive should have taken five minutes. After fifteen, she was still circling the same three blocks, the fog playing tricks with distance and direction. Finally, the station materialized—a squat brick building with one lit window.

She shouldered through the door. ""I need to report a missing—""

The office was empty. Coffee still steamed in a mug on the desk. The dispatch radio hissed static. On the wall, a town map marked with red pins. Fresh ones clustered around the Hargrove house.

""Sheriff Reed?"" Her voice echoed off concrete walls.

A door slammed somewhere in the building. Footsteps—no, something dragging. Elena drew the Glock, finger hovering over the trigger. 

The lights went out.

In the darkness, she heard breathing that wasn't her own. Smelled something rank—spoiled meat and old sweat. The whispers from the house found her here, worming into her ears:

*Blood calls to blood. Sin calls to sin.*

Her phone buzzed. In its pale light, she saw a text from an unknown number:

*Check the garage.*

---

The mechanic's shop sat two blocks over. Elena ran through empty streets, fog swirling away from her feet. The bay doors stood open, fluorescents humming inside. She smelled it before she saw it—copper and shit, death stinking up the place.

Tony Russo hung from an engine hoist, split from throat to groin. His intestines made gray ropes in the harsh light. Someone had arranged his tools beneath him in a careful pattern. Written on the wall in what had recently been inside Tony:

*THE HARVEST BEGINS.*

Elena's scream caught in her throat. Through the fog, she heard others now—cries, breaking glass, the town coming apart at its rotten seams. 

Behind her, footsteps. Heavy. Deliberate.

She turned, gun raised, and saw only fog. But in that fog, a shape. Tall as two men, moving without moving, getting closer without seeming to take steps.

The whispers became a roar.

You're running low on groceries ""ALLEGEDLY"", your friend  drops off food bank food, that you then split that food with your mom so you can get more vapes. Which tells me"" you must not be running to low on food"". you play sad music implying you ate once today! But then start the day off my saying "" I'm having my first meal"". WHAT? YOU FRIEND JUST BROUGHT YOU FOOD! ALSO THE PROPER WORDING WOULD BE ""MY ONLY MEAL FOR THE DAY"" BUT YOU CLAIM 1ST MEAL which tells me there is a 2nd and 3rd meal. WHICH CATCHES KIM IN A LIE!  You eat more than one meal a day Kim!  Jon has enough money for sushi, pizza and Chinese so y'all have money! All i can say it if you're hungry keep hitting the vapes, because that it what you prioritize. I think it's best to stop mentioning what meal you're eating. it makes your come off sketchy. Shes eating 1 meal today but going out to eat Tomorow? Gave her mom extra food but her mom is cashing checks and getting haircuts Tomorow. are these people real struggling or just taking advantage of everyone. I rather see someone who really needs the food get it.  Nothing is enough for Kim. Lisa brought that food and hand delivered it to her the very next day you're claiming your still only eating once.  You know she had hot dogs if she is heating them up for Jon.   

 Going to spend $19 on a coffee creamer? I thought you're low on food? Why not buy FOOD!  All she does is complain about food bank food, so why take it at all since your so stuck up about it. Let's be honest if she split the food with her mom it's because the food bank food is not up to ""par"" for Kim. 

 The only reason you started saying thank you is because your TikTok sisters reminded you to. You would walk up and snatch the fast-food bag from the door dasher knowing you gave no tip as that person pulls up to a 4 bedroom house or your current two story house. You have no manners! For the love of God who brushes their hair near their food? your hair has to be falling out everywhere. every time she sits down, she has to comb it right before she eats. 

BTW kim i know you're not buying the vapes, your mom gives them to you for free. we know. My point being if you're eating one meal a day with your monthly grocery money, then the food bank food should be enough to allow your more meals daily for the rest of the month.

1m8r7va,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1m8r7va/is_my_friends_boyfriend_real/,Is my friend's boyfriend real?,"I've (F36) known my friend ""Lynn"" (48) for almost 5 years now. We met through a local meetup when lockdowns started to subside. She’s my concert and coffee buddy, we share a love for the same types of music and a coffee. 

Lynn has apparently been with her boyfriend ""Leon"" (M50?) for nearly 15 years. He is the love of her life and has taken such good care of Lynn over the years. He cooks, he cleans, he cares about her feelings, he's good in bed.

But I've never actually met Leon. Never seen him, or spoke to him. Nobody we mutually know has. According to Lynn, he wants to meet me and have dinner sometime. But dinner plans have never actually happened, even when I've tried to set a time and place. All I've seen are some photos of a guy who she says is Leon.

I've also never been inside Lynn's apartment. I've picked her up in the parking lot, but have never been invited inside. Generally, she has either come over to my place or we meet up in public.

She insists their apartment is too messy and also, Leon is terminally ill. He's a recluse who works part-time from home and was supposed to pass away about 7-8 years ago. But he hasn't yet. Therefore, he's afraid of venturing out of the house or meeting people, catching a cold, and dying. So he's just hanging on for as long as he can in their messy apartment.

Now that nearly 5 years have gone by, I can't help but think something smells bad about this situation. My current hypotheses are:
1. Lynn dearly loves Leon is and trying to hold onto him for as long as possible.
2. Leon is very mentally ill. Lynn is covering for him for some reason instead getting him therapy. Or Leon is stringing her along with how sick he is and living off of her. 
3. Leon doesn't exist. Lynn is very mentally ill and has done a relatively good job hiding it for 5 years.

So how do I handle this? Do I try to meet Leon to get more information? Do I assume my friend herself is unwell and try to get her some help? Do I just stay out of it and take it her word for everything? End the friendship? I find myself avoiding her because I feel so conflicted.

TL;DR: I'm not sure if my friend's long-term boyfriend is real or not. Her stories and lack of me meeting him reek of him living in Canada and my friend living in La-La-Land.",1,1753422433.0,relationships,5,1.0,False
1m8r7hg,https://www.reddit.com/r/bikefit/comments/1m8r7hg/ferla_bike_and_ferla_x_beware_review_compilation/,Ferla Bike and Ferla X Beware. Review compilation,"Ferla X Vending Bike – Comprehensive Review Compilation

The Ferla X is a flagship coffee & vending tricycle marketed as a versatile “café on wheels.” Priced in the $8,000–$20,000 range (depending on configuration), it promises an all-in-one mobile shop with features like a built-in sink, battery-powered freezer, and optional electric pedal assist ￼ ￼. To understand how it performs in the real world, we’ve gathered every review and testimonial we could find – from customer feedback on Trustpilot, Reddit, Yelp and more, to professional/influencer reviews (YouTube walkarounds, blog posts, case studies). Below is a structured report with each source type, direct quotes highlighting strengths and weaknesses (durability, build quality, customer service, performance, portability, component issues, and value), plus a summary Pros & Cons table.

Customer Reviews & Testimonials

Trustpilot Reviews (Verified Customer Feedback)

On Trustpilot, Ferla Bikes has a low rating (TrustScore 3.2/5 with 1 review as of Jan 2025) ￼ ￼. The sole Trustpilot reviewer gives Ferla X a 1-star and recounts severe reliability issues over one year of use. This customer, Dominique B., was initially excited to start a mobile coffee cart, but reports that “in one year the battery failed, the refrigerator door ripped off due to incorrect hinges, the water pump broke, and the cabinet came unglued.” Even more alarming, “on October 26, 2024 the worst possible thing happened… The kingpin snaps while I’m riding the Ferla X. It was only luck that I wasn’t hurt as I was on a street with cars.” The reviewer adds that post-purchase support was “ok, but very unorganized… texting a person with no accountability” and that after the major breakdown “the company has been less than helpful and the bike is still not operable, taking my business with it.” He “would not recommend investing the $10k–$20k they ask”, especially if you’re not in Southern California (implying remote customers get worse support) ￼ ￼.

Yelp Reviews (Business Directory Feedback)

Ferla Bikes’ Yelp page (Azusa, CA) features a mix of positive and negative customer stories (24 reviews as of mid-2025). On the positive side, some owners rave about the concept and build: “Purchased my first Coffee Bike and I cannot say how happy I am… Superior quality. It’s actually made from real wood which makes this bike stand out! Today I made my first buck. I love it!!!” (5★ review by Yulia K.) ￼. Another buyer praised Ferla’s team for helping her business: “I purchased directly from the owner Feras. He inspired me to open my own mobile business… Looking forward to purchase my second coffee bike!” ￼. These testimonials highlight good build materials and the entrepreneurial value the Ferla X can provide when everything goes right.

However, many Yelp reviews echo serious complaints. One detailed 1★ review describes receiving a defective unit and even a problematic replacement: “It was not my fault the second bike (a used Ferla X) broke the first day and was missing parts. The bike is only being held together with zip ties.” The reviewer says an independent contractor, electrician, and bike shop all examined the Ferla X and told him “there is no way the bike would last [long] due to the weight of the back box” ￼. In the end, this customer was frustrated with Ferla’s response (an apology from a rep and an offer to swap models) and warns others away. Similarly, another Yelp user mentions being sold a scratched unit without a fridge as a “deal,” experiencing immediate failures, and ultimately having to push Ferla to make it right (noting “Steven was nice” during the resolution). These accounts underscore quality control issues (parts missing or breaking on arrival) and a reactive support that sometimes involves replacing the product with a different model rather than truly fixing underlying problems.

It’s worth noting that Ferla’s own site showcases some of these Yelp testimonials as success stories, while unhappy Yelp reviews emphasize unreliability. The contrast is stark – one Yelp highlight mentions “a sincere apology and [Ferla] offered to do right by us” (indicating the company at times rectified issues), but others like the zip-tie story indicate initial products that should never have shipped in that condition.

Reddit Community Reactions

On Reddit, discussions about Ferla bikes (both the Ferla X vending bike and the Ferla family cargo bikes) provide unfiltered customer experiences. In r/CargoBike, a detailed “Ferla Family Cargo Bike Review” post from 2022 gained attention for its harsh critique. The original poster admonishes prospective buyers: “You absolutely want to buy a cargo bike… Just please, do not purchase THIS [Ferla] bike. The price is astronomical, the quality questionable, the customer service terrible. I cannot, and will not, recommend this product.” ￼. Other cargo-bike owners chimed in agreeing: one said Ferla’s support was “shockingly rude… In all of my life, I have never had a worse customer service experience”, describing zero accountability for delays, missing parts, and even being blamed by Ferla for not “reaching out before purchasing” to double-check what the website promised ￼ ￼. (In fact, this user reported the head of the company personally messaged them doubling down and demanding they remove their negative review, which only reinforced the feeling that “the company’s problems are coming from the top” ￼.) Multiple Redditors mention accessories not delivered (or arriving broken), months-long delays with no proactive communication, and an inability to get phone support. A parent who bought a $6k Ferla cargo bike noted the bike itself was “okay” but “it arrived damaged without a headlight… No one answers the phone… no manual or instructions included – I could not figure out how to charge it for weeks.” ￼ ￼ This user calls the experience “amateur and poor” and urges others to buy from competitors like Bunch Bikes ￼.

In r/bikewrench, a bicycle mechanic asked for tips repairing a friend’s Ferla X coffee bike, leading to candid technical opinions. One experienced bike tech responded: “Honestly, it is a death trap – one step better than the worst of the Alibaba bikes. The steering geometry feels terrible and their plywood structure is inadequate. It isn’t the absolute worst, but if your friend makes decent money with this setup I’d encourage a complete rebuild in the off-season.” ￼ They advised upgrading brakes and reinforcing the entire front box with metal framing, essentially implying the stock build isn’t sturdy enough ￼. The original poster then lamented that “Ferla folks were useless. No tech documents, no new parts in until end of summer, and not much beyond a ‘good luck.’” He agreed the factory box was unwieldy and noted the owner was now limiting use to very short, flat routes, as “I wouldn’t take it too far.” ￼ This thread highlights poor build/design (needing aftermarket fixes) and lack of support/parts availability, aligning with other reviews. On a related note, another Redditor did some research and discovered the Ferla bikes being sold in the US appear to be rebranded imports: “At the last minute I did more research… I saw the [Ferla] bike on Alibaba and realized that despite Ferla’s good marketing they are reselling a Chinese model.” ￼ This revelation made that user opt for a different brand, feeling Ferla’s premium price wasn’t justified if the underlying product wasn’t unique.

Not all Reddit feedback is negative. In r/foodtrucks, a user who actually owns and operates a Ferla coffee cart shared a positive experience: “I’ve been working the Ferla Coffee Cart for a bit! It’s honestly been very good for my business. Solid build and super handy, very convenient for serving customers… it’s been totally worth it for my mobile coffee business.” ￼. This person encouraged others not to hesitate. Such praise, however, is sparse compared to the volume of cautionary tales. It’s possible that satisfied Ferla X users are simply less vocal online, but the enthusiastic endorsements are mostly from brand ambassadors or Ferla’s own promotions, whereas the organic user community leans toward warning others.

Google Reviews and Other Platforms

Ferla’s presence on Google (e.g. Google Maps reviews) is limited. The company’s Google listing shows a moderately positive rating (around 4 out of 5 stars) with a few dozen reviews, but specific Ferla X feedback is hard to find in those. Most Google comments are brief, and many appear to be about the family bikes or general service. One Google reviewer simply states they were “thrilled” with their Ferla bike purchase for a catering business (without detail). Another local guide mentioned enjoying a test ride at Ferla’s warehouse and complimented staff helpfulness (similar to some Yelp comments about in-person visits: “Erik was so patient and super helpful”). These indicate that the pre-sale experience (test riding, sales reps) can be positive. However, comprehensive Google testimonial content is scarce compared to the in-depth stories on Reddit and Yelp.

Outside of social media, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) profile for Ferla Bikes is telling: Ferla is not BBB-accredited and currently holds a rating of “F.” The BBB reports multiple unresolved complaints (at least two formal complaints with “Failure to respond” by the business) ￼ ￼. While details aren’t given, an F rating supports what many customers described: problems after purchase and difficulty getting satisfactory responses.

Summary of Customer Feedback: Across these consumer-driven platforms, a clear pattern emerges. Pros include the Ferla X’s promising concept and feature set, attractive design, and the success some entrepreneurs have had using it as a turnkey business (when it works, it truly can enable a profitable mobile café). Customers appreciate the all-in-one convenience (one said it “offers it all” ￼), the aesthetic appeal (real wood finishes, eye-catching presence), and the inspiration it provides to start a business (“I love it… I’m not working for anyone now!” as one owner put it ￼). A few have noted the bike feels solid and handles the intended job well in daily operation.

However, the cons voiced by customers are significant: durability problems (from minor issues like pumps and lights not working, up to major structural failures), inconsistent build quality (parts breaking or coming loose far too soon), and particularly poor customer service after the sale. The support is described as slow, disorganized, and even antagonistic in some cases. Getting replacement parts or repairs under warranty has been a challenge for many, especially those outside Ferla’s home region. Many customers feel the product is overpriced given these issues – some explicitly regret spending thousands on a Ferla bike and encourage others to consider competitors. The word “lemon” has been used in frustration by at least one Redditor. In short, actual user experiences range from enthusiastic success stories to catastrophic failures, with a noticeable skew toward the latter in detailed online discussions.

I text him like 30 minutes before im off to take a look at some restaurants to order food from because I’m too tired to cook tonight and he responds with “we have been eating out a lot”. 

That’s true we have been, I just took on a new job and a side project so I’ve been a little more busy than usual and am still figuring out my schedule, so I’ve been more tired and too exhausted to cook; I usually handle getting grocceries, cooking meals, and kitchen stuff. Because this is my chore, I have been buying our take out; so he hasn’t even been paying for food. 

When I get home a little past 11pm he tells me he wants me to cook and chastises me for not feeding our pets earlier today, I was literally at work at the normal time they are supposed to be fed and I also told him earlier before that time that I didn’t feed them and for him to do it because I worked too early to feed them. He “doesn’t remember” me saying that, I remember because I wanted him to do it; I don’t want my pets to go unfed all day! 

He also said that he can wait a little bit and that I don’t need to cook right now. It is literally 11pm at night and I am starving, I am not cooking, so I tell him that and start looking at some places to order from. Every place I’m naming off he doesn’t want to eat from, I genuinely think him saying no was an indirect way to get me to cook dinner. Eventually he says he is just going to sleep and doesn’t need to eat, so I say fine I’m still not cooking I’m going to order myself some Mexican food. I ask him three more time before I place the order if he wants anything and he says no. As soon as I place the order he asks me to make him some spring rolls. 

At this point I’m so done I just say ok and do it because it’s not that big of a task. When the food comes he grabs it from the door and I plate his spring rolls and we eat in bed because Im so tired, I’m watching an episode of my favourite show while we are doing this. Like half way through the show he asks me if I can put the food away and turn off the light in the kitchen and “close down” our apartment, that’s fine I say I’ll do it. As soon as my episode finishes and I haven’t even clicked pause on the end credits he reminds me again to do it, like I’m so stupid I forgot?? What the hell duh I’m going to do it like give me a second. 

This just sort of sends me over the edge, literally the other day I was working on my side gig at home when he got home from work and had a whole conversation with me about how I should greet him nicely at the door and take his coat from him when I’m home, which I’m fine with; but the double standard is crazy. 

Like why does he think it’s ok to chastise me as soon as I come home, bark commands at me, and not even give me a hug or ask me how my day was??? I actually don’t understand, I bought him a coffee today and gave him a discount on his sandwich and even picked up a sweet treat on the way home because he asked me too and all because I’m too tired to cook dinner I get to be treated like I suck?? 

Mind you he’s been home since 5 pm. He’s an adult, we have food, he could have made something for us to eat. He didn’t even run any errands or do any chores, the garbage and recycling still aren’t done, there is laundry everywhere, dishes aren’t done, his dirty socks are infront of the tv, he could have swept the floors or atleast done something?? But no he just got home and played his game all day. 

This set up was fine when I was working only part time and had much more time to do chores around the house, but he’s the one that pushed me to get a new job with more hours. Why does all the responsibility for the house work still remain on me? 

This is probably where I’m the asshole. I got so angry, I turned my computer volume and brightness all the way up because I knew it would bother him; and it did and now he’s sleeping in the couch. 

I probably shouldn’t have done that I let my emotions get the best of me, but it’s not fair we literally just had a conversation about: me greeting him at the door, letting him have 30 minutes to cool off before I start talking to him, taking his coat from him and warming up his coffee after he gets home from work; why can’t he do the same for me? 

I just want an apology, I understand he is probably still tired from work earlier that day and just wants a chill night and good food, I want that too. I just don’t understand why when things go wrong it’s my fault. Idk what to do here. I really want to know if I’m over reacting. 

He does pay pretty much all the bills except for my phone bill and our groceries, he also has a much more physical job than I do. ",4,1753422307.0,AmIOverreacting,9,1.0,False

After spending significant time in each district, I've developed a pretty good understanding of what makes each area special.

The North Shore stands out as my top pick for the ""nicest"" area of Oahu. It perfectly balances natural beauty with local culture, offering a more authentic Hawaiian experience away from the tourist crowds. The famous Banzai Pipeline and Sunset Beach showcase world-class surfing, while the charming town of Haleiwa offers local boutiques and amazing food trucks.

During my recent Circle Island Tour (which I'll get to in a minute), I discovered that each region of Oahu has its own unique charm:

Waikiki: The energy here is undeniable. Perfect for first-time visitors who want easy access to beaches, shopping, and dining. However, it can get pretty crowded.

Ko Olina: This is where you'll find luxury resorts and pristine lagoons. It's more secluded and peaceful than Waikiki, ideal for families or those seeking a quieter vacation.

Windward Coast (Kailua/Lanikai): Home to some of the most beautiful beaches in Hawaii. The turquoise waters and powder-soft sand make this area incredibly photogenic. 

Here's a pro tip: To truly appreciate these different areas, I highly recommend taking a guided tour. I recently took this amazing Circle Island Tour (https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island) that changed my whole perspective on the island. The local guide showed us hidden spots I never would have found on my own, including a gorgeous waterfall at Waimea Valley where we got to swim.

The tour covered all the major areas I mentioned, plus some incredible stops like:
- Historic lookouts with breathtaking coastal views
- Secret spots where they filmed Jurassic Park
- Local farms where we sampled fresh Kona coffee
- Traditional Hawaiian cultural sites

What made this tour special was how it combined the tourist highlights with authentic local experiences. We got to see the famous North Shore garlic shrimp trucks, swim at a waterfall, and learn about Hawaiian history from someone who actually lives it.

For anyone planning their first trip to Oahu, I'd recommend starting with this tour early in your stay. It helps you get oriented and figure out which areas you want to explore more deeply later.

The reality is that the ""nicest"" area of Oahu depends on what you're looking for. The North Shore wins for authenticity and natural beauty, but each region offers something unique. That's why seeing the whole island first helped me appreciate each area's distinct character.

I've visited many islands, but Oahu's diversity makes it special. From bustling city life to serene beaches, historic sites to modern attractions, you can experience it all here. Just make sure you venture beyond your hotel area to truly appreciate what makes each part of the island unique.

Feel free to ask any specific questions about different areas - I'd love to share more detailed insights from my experience!",1,1753421505.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

Now Sabrina has health issues (as anyone does). One example is that there’s clearly something wrong with her joints/bones because they crack way more often than normal. She can crack them at will almost infinitely. But she doesn’t have a family doctor, and refuses to get them checked. I worry they’ll only get worse with time, and if they’re this bad now, who only knows if they’re left unchecked for years. 

Another is that she hasn’t been to the dentist in years, and I’ve been trying to encourage it by saying she has nothing to fear and it’ll be good for her. And that all she has to do is go once and it’ll be easier every time after that. I get that she’s afraid, I want to be supportive, but it’s important and I’d be lying if I said it didn’t somewhat bother me that she doesn’t go. 

Sabrina also has heart issues, one time while walking we literally had to stop because her heart was hurting too much. She told me this does not happen often but has in the past occurred before. She’s even apparently coughed blood before but not in the time I’ve known her. This has never been checked by a doctor. 

More examples is that she vapes a lot, drinks a ton of caffeine (like 5 coffees a day), and has been gaining weight because she’s not as active as she used to be. Now the weight isn’t really an issue I want that to be clear, my only concern is that alongside her already bad joints, and heart issues… extra weight can’t be good for her. 

I’m also not trying to act like I’m a pillar of health here. I have my issues, I’m underweight for my size and could stand to gain more. I also definitely dont eat healthy enough. I also have joint issues of my own, been dealing with foot pain for the past few months. The difference is that I’m trying, I went to the doctor for my feet and they’re getting better. I’m working on my diet. I’ve also set a goal to gain 15 pounds by the end of the year. 

My point is that I want to spend the rest of my life with Sabrina, but I worry she won’t be around for the rest of my life at this rate. I also feel like a bad person for thinking that way, maybe I am. I guess that’s what I’m asking, how do I address this with her? How can I encourage her to care more about her own well being?

its literally illegal as well. the firms i'd work for unpaid are actually successful and can afford to pay their interns, quite well actually, despite being super in demand (i.e., actual large companies)",5,1753421200.0,auscorp,7,0.86,False

It’s a terrible feeling being watched. Knowing that there is something observing you.

It’s an even worse feeling when you have looked everywhere but have no idea what could be watching you

It’s a feeling that many people have experienced in their life and if you haven’t then count yourself as one of the lucky few.

Ever since I was young I’ve felt like I was being watched. Not all the time, usually when I was laying in bed late at night. I would turn my phone flashlight on and do sweep of the room But there was never anything there

I’ve lived in a few different houses growing up, my parents liked to move around and in every house I’ve had this feeling. But I’ve always chalked it up to just anxiety or an over active imagination

But recently it’s been feeling, different

I just moved out and into my own house and am now living alone.

It’s been taking some getting used to, now knowing there is no one else in the house with me. But I liked it. The privacy was nice and I was able to stay up as late as I wanted

I have always had trouble sleeping, partly because of that feeling I mentioned earlier and also just having plain insomnia so I tend to stay up late.

Lately though, I haven’t been able to sleep for more than a few hours

I just lay in bed, and listen

I never hear anything

I never see anything

But I feel it

Even if you can’t tell is something’s there, you just know There’s some instinct that tells us there’s danger

I usually fall asleep around 3 am Still sitting up with my phone in hand Battery dead from constantly turning on and off the flashlight

I work from home so I usually just get straight to work on my computer fueled by a dangerous amount of coffee

After a bit of working I hear this weird noise It’s quiet but I could still hear it while wearing my headphones. It sounded almost like a scratching, but really small like someone using a sewing needle to carve letters into a wooden table.

I turned around and the sound stopped, I looked around and I couldn’t find anything. I chalked it up to just the old apartment making sounds.

I went to bed late that night, or early I guess. Around like 4 am. I did my usual routine of checking my room crawling into bed and then using my phone flashlight to scan around the room

There are some night where I wonder if I actually still feel like I’m being watched or if it’s just a compulsion that I feel I need to do

Either way I did that for about and hour and finally felt myself falling asleep But then I heard it again

That scratching sound

It was a little louder now, but with the same cadence and rhythm

Scratch, scratch, scratch

I quickly grabbed my phone and looked around

It stopped

Nothing seemed different in my room

I turned the light off and it started again

Light on, sound stop, light off, it starts again

All night long, until eventually at some point I passed out

When I woke up the next morning I scanned my room, everything seemed the same

I couldn't find anything, until I looked at the wall facing my bed

There was a tiny hole. The size that you would make to hang up a picture a few feet from the ground.

I looked at it and tried to shine my light to see if there was anything behind it. But the hole was to small to even look though

Termites was what I figured, I decided I would call the exterminator in the morning.

I didn’t here the scratching at all that day I spent most of it just playing games and trying to relax after last night

That night i heard it again, it started as soon as I hopped in bed, the feeling of being watched feeling worse than ever

Every time I turned my flashlight on the sound would stop, I would glance at the small hole hoping to see a termite crawl out

But nothing, just another restless night Until I passed out in the early hours of the morning.

What I awoke to shook me to my core, it was the most gut wrenching feeling

When I looked at the hole it had gotten bigger and what was in it was an eye staring back at me

I didn’t know what to do I just sat there as it stared at me lifeless for a second

“who are you” I demanded at the eye

But it just stared back at me It looked to be almost frozen in place It didn’t move or blink It just watched me in silence

“Why are you watching me” I screamed at it But I got no response

After a moment of silence I decided to go to the kitchen and grab a knife with full intention to stab the eye that was stalking me.

But when I came back it wasn’t there, there was just a small quarter sized whole in my wall

I called the cops right after that, they came pretty quickly and the whole time waiting I just sat on my bed, staring at the hole

The police did a sweep of my room and the rest of the house. And found nothing

They also said there were no holes anywhere else in the house and even if there were the walls are far to thin for any person to hide in them.

They just told me to get some sleep, that I looked exhausted

I stayed up all night that night, and the next and the next. Staring at it.

Nothing, no scratching no eye. Somehow I knew I just needed to keep watching it. Every time I would look away or go in the other room. I could hear it. Slowly chipping away at my wall. Creeping closer.

This went on for a few days, in that time the hole had only grew about a centimeter in diameter.

But that night I couldn’t stay awake, it had been close to a 3 days without sleep and there is only so much coffee and Red Bull can do

I passed out, I hadn’t slept for over 50 hours and was exhausted. My body couldn’t take any more. When I woke up it was the middle of the night. I was mortified

The hole had grown to over the size of a football. But I couldn't see anything inside and there was no scratching to be heard

I reached for my phone to look around.

And what I saw In the corner of my room still haunts me

It was a man, if you could even call it that

It was so pale and gaunt, you could see each rib and its skin looked shrink wrapped to the bones

Its teeth were a grotesque black and yellow and affixed into an abhorrent smile

It just stood in the corner, and watched. Unblinking without a sound.

I didn’t know what to do, I was petrified with fear But I knew I couldn’t stay I had to get out of there

After a few seconds of my motionless state I ran I ran faster and harder then I had ever ran before Fueled by the most overwhelming feeling of terror ever in my life

In a blind panic I went straight for my car and drove, all I wanted to do was get as far away from that house and that thing ad I possibly could. After about a half hour of driving I calmed down and called the police

The police investigated the house and nearby area but couldn't find anything.

I was able to get all my stuff out of the house, but every time I passed by that hole I felt a shiver go down my spine

But at the same time, I heard no sounds and for the first time in years. I didn’t feel like I was being watched

I moved back in with my parents, they were kind enough to let me stay with them until I could sell the house

it’s been a few weeks, and I’ve felt safe. But last night I felt it again That terrible feeling And when I went to bed All I could hear Was scratch scratch scratch.",1,1753421123.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

(basis of one of our fights)

this girl i was friends with that i am not friends with anymore, chrissy, (as of a long time ago) was causing issues again, and unfortunately she's a coworker of mine. she was at the point she was so passive aggressive towards me my other coworkers asked me wth was happening. i was also incredibly frustrated, and thought we were over our issues from *months* ago. i brought this up to my bf, and he said he'd talk to his bsf, who also works with me. i specifically told him to update me as this goes along, and don't message chrissy under any circumstances, and dont create any more problems. he agreed, and i calmed down a bit. 

as of a few nights ago, i get this message from chrissy, including a ss of a message my bf sent to her, apologizing on his and *my* behalf. i was out, and so confused. i asked him what this was abt, and he said we were both assholes to her the entire time. i was angry that he specifically went against my wishes, and i ask him wth he meant its ""us being the assholes"", bc obviously that was not the case.  (chrissy was trying to take my bf when we first started dating) he refused to tell me over text that night. i called him at 4:30 that morning for him to explain, and he said chrissy wasn't targeting me, only mad abt my 'work performance' and not intentionally being passive aggressive, only avoiding me to ignore drama. (as she gets mad at me and ignores me when i ask for help) then, he said he apologized bc he was assuming she was being passive aggressive, and its our fault. which i am not okay with him apologizing for me, bc i don't feel this way, and he specifically didn't tell me what was happening, and texted chrissy against my wishes. he said that was bc i 'have a lot going on'...i was like bruh....he briefly apologized for not communicating with me, but that damage was alr done.

shortly after we talked abt that, and i cooled down a little bit, got some coffee, wtv, he brings up the fact that he was upset abt me kissing my bsf goodbye. now i have done that with my bsf for *years*. he's been fine with it up until now. he said theres a fine line of goofing off and cheating. i, obviously did not appreicate that, bc i've always kissed tina goodbye, and that stung. I told him i have had zero romantic interest in my bsf of 6 years and am happily dating him. he still seemed upset, which I apologized, and said i am genuinely sorry you feel that way

he brought up getting coffee, and watching a movie. i told him i'm really not up for that atm, and i was still kinda upset over all the drama that went down this week. he's been dry all day since i said that, and just really icy in general. AITA for telling him i didn't want to hang out? am i being overdramatic about everything? ",2,1753421018.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

the dad/uncle died or was far away and left this girl a lot of his inheritance including 1 shop i can remember that was a coffee shop or something.  
the stepmother and kids stole all from her.  
she met a duke/prince and i think at first they had a contract engagement but ended up falling in love anyways.

Titled this Friends. while we are strangers I just feel the chemistry is different from what I would typically expect you seem genuinely interested even if it’s curiosity.


Hey, for starters I’m weird and awkward and I doubt you’ll ever find yourself In any of these subs however writing it down helps me work and wrestle with my thoughts.



I’m throwing this out because the last two times I went by for some 7 everything oddly lined up.

I can’t lie I was asking for some sort of guidance from my Father “The universe maker”

And oddly enough I had been able to see you talk to you and then….Intrusion….i didn’t take it as bad he was doing his job and you had just happen to say hi.

But thinking back anytime I come by you pop out or try and say hi.

You tell everyone Mr.C… is a great guy

Oh that’s Mr.c

While it’s odd hearing someone call me Mr.

I know you’re just being respectful.

I like that but the first time we talked I complimented your neckless I thought it was Sumerian and you had corrected me and I already forgot but it was months ago.

I did complement your goddess neckless.

It reminded me of the fertility Goddess but more so reminded me of deans neckless.

You know from supernatural.

But I just wanted to say I appreciate seeing you and having someone seem interested in talking or seeing me.

I’m very guarded and it wasn’t weird or anything now I seek it in return but I’m definitely cautious you know my name and speak so highly of me it seems even to co workers I leave after getting my coffee and my ear burns the good side…so I believe maybe it’s you talking to your coworker the one that was very overly nice but I wasn’t even looking towards her I turned that corner saw you and….Damn…🙃 

Here I am writing this getting high and forgot about my food….but it’s been a long time since someone threw me off like this it’s hard when I’m so guarded.

Maybe your just being nice is what I convince myself that it’s just part of your job.

That’s it your nice and friendly because your job?

Sorry I’m just confused slightly because you made a joke….so this gives it away big time….you had asked if it was me because I didn’t get the Banana Bread. Instead I got my old drink I didn’t drink 24/7 like the banana bread.

But yea this is how I’m gonna work through it.

Don’t get me wrong I definitely wanted to go back and see about talking to you more but that’s weird…

Even though we had laughed about me being a doppelgänger because I didn’t get the banana bread. My response was no it’s just me…..you continued and I responded with…. as far as I know I don’t have a doppelgänger and you laughed.

I kind of laughed slightly inside because you hit 6 instead of 5 and I’ve done that kind of thing on any touch screen.

So leaving this here and telling myself it’s just you being kind and expressing yourself at work. 

It doesn’t mean we had any chemistry or anything.

If we did I would like to understand it better.

Only time will be the judge but writing it helps the best I would love to be that guy that makes you feel special for going out of my way and coming back just to talk to you.

However without  better understanding I don’t want to be that weird guy that comes through and makes it awkward.


😬 Yikes but this is interesting definitely asked for some kind of clarification with you.  I prayed and each time I saw you.

Each time you got busy or the other employee out spoke you and wouldn’t let you say almost anything to me and I was just like….but I would have rather talked to her first…that’s another thing you know my first and last name…..I don’t need to know but I’d like to know besides referring to you in my own words as “Her” 

I’ll do the only thing I know that leads my sails…..Pray….Ask God and have him lead me.  I’ve been stranded for quite some time.

But I’ve asked prayed and been reading my bible more then what’s been common for myself.

The more devotion I show the more of a response on guidance I seem to be getting buts it’s just very strange how everything is going Smoothly that’s the thing I’ve heard….


If it’s a door from god there isn’t any discomfort it’s easy and smooth comfortable.


If it’s something that’s uncomfortable or causes you grief it’s probably not a door from god.


Using this and asking with obedience I’ve started to get alot of guidance.


Just FYI this is my perspective and my experience.

I hope I posted in the right spot. English is not my 1st language, so I am sorry if I wrote something wrong.

My (f37) friend had a weird interaction with a coworker that I think she should tell someone and warn her husband. But she does not want to. She (f40) was on her way home from work when she met a coworker (m50). She said bye to him and said she will see him tomorrow. She went to do something in an office  that is on the opposite part of the building where they work. When she came out on the hallway, the dude was standing there, waiting for her. Mind you this was happening in the only part of the building withouth cameras and the lights were only half litten so she got really scared when she saw him coming.

Mind you that the exit from the building is nowhere near this hallway, so he had to walk a distance to come and wait for her there. Anyway the weird part comes next. She said hi to him and tried to go pass him, but he stopped her and pulled a knife out of the pocket and he swung it towards her. He did not harm her, but she got really scared and almost ran. It was dark, they were the last ones in and he had a freaking knife. Anyway. She told me this a few days ago and I got really scared. I told her to tell her boss. Well she did not. And yesterday she told me he knows where she lives, he has her number and he wants to take her to a remote part of the woods for knife and shooting practice. Its like in a horror movie. And for the last 3 months, he has been waiting for her to finish work and he walks out with her. She has to pass his office to get to the exit and he waits for her to walk her to her car or just to the parking lot.

 He keeps saying that he has pulled the knife out several times already to ppl he knows or just random ppl, the last time being in a coffee shop with an ex coworker and a guy came pass them and this man put a knife to his throat. Just for passing by and accidentally touching his hand. Do not know what his intentions for my friend are but I really am scared for her.

Well this is where i fkd up. Yesterday we went for a cup of coffee and her husband came by. When we were alone (before the husband came), I asked my friend to tell her husband because I am scared for her safety and for her family. She has little kids. And when the husband came by, I told him in front of the friend that something is happening and I am really scared and I hope they will talk. I did not tell him what is happening, I just mentioned that is work related and they should talk. She said I crossed a line and is really mad at me. She said she cannot trust me anymore and wont speak to me.

I do not want to lose her, but I am scared out of my mind for her and her family. The coworker brings not only one, but many knives everywhere he goes. He has a history of attacking people (so he says). Am I the A for saying this and how can I make things better with my friend? I have been crying all night because I hurt her and I do not know what to do. My other friends say I did not do anything wrong and that she should be freaking out more about this and telling people at home and at work. What should I do?

Muita gente acha que o café é inofensivo ou até ajuda no foco. Mas pouca gente fala que o abuso da cafeína pode ser inimigo da sua jornada NoFap. Aqui vão os pontos principais:


1. Aumenta a impulsividade
Cafeína aumenta dopamina no cérebro, ativando o mesmo sistema de recompensa envolvido na pornografia. Você fica mais agitado, impaciente e com maior chance de buscar prazer rápido. Isso é péssimo quando você tá tentando controlar impulsos.

2. Afeta o equilíbrio emocional
Quando você para de tomar café ou diminui o consumo, pode sentir ansiedade, irritação, dor de cabeça e tristeza. Parece até abstinência de pornografia. Isso pode te deixar emocionalmente mais fraco e levar a recaídas.

3. É um vício disfarçado

Café é legalizado, socialmente aceito e vendido em todo canto. Mas a dependência de cafeína é real e reconhecida pela medicina (DSM‑5). Ela cria tolerância e necessidade constante de mais estímulo — o mesmo padrão de comportamento de vícios.

4. É um gatilho oculto para recaídas

Quem toma muito café relata insônia, pensamentos acelerados, inquietação e... aumento da libido. Isso somado ao estresse do dia a dia, pode ser a gota d’água pro gatilho de PMO.

O que fazer?

• Reduz o café aos poucos (cortar de uma vez dá rebote emocional).
• Toma mais água e dorme bem — o que o café disfarça, o descanso de verdade resolve.
• Troca por chás sem cafeína (camomila, erva-doce etc).
• Fica atento: o reboot também precisa de estabilidade mental — e o café pode ser um sabotador disfarçado.
Se você sente que sua mente tá hiperestimulada, impaciente e ansiosa… talvez o café não seja seu aliado. Ele pode ser o “empurrão” que te leva de volta ao ciclo de PMO sem você perceber.
Desacelera. Cuida do teu reboot.

This past Sunday, I attended my first Orthodox Orthros and Divine Liturgy, and it was beautiful. An elder motherly woman welcomed me and introduced me to several parishioners. Was invited to sit at the men’s table during coffee hour and even had a meaningful conversation with the priest before leaving. I could sense his deep love and reverence for God. He blessed the Cross I wear over the Bible used during Liturgy and gave me a prayer rope, and encouraged me to pray with it daily. I’ve worn my cross ever since (except during sleep).

However, since that visit, I’ve had unusual and unsettling experiences. That same night, I had disturbing dreams, nightmares tied to my past, that woke me up twice. I’ve continued waking between 1–3 a.m. and haven’t slept soundly since. Last night, my curtain rod inexplicably fell above my head, with the screw landing right beside me as if it were flung. I prayed through the night using the prayer rope, especially as I heard strange noises outside my window.

For context, I’ve recently given up many passions of my past; yoga, weed, self-abuse, and other habits, as I’ve turned toward Christ and begun praying the Jesus Prayer regularly. I have the Christ on the Orthodox Cross Icon above my bed as well. I’m curious if what I’m experiencing is some kind of spiritual resistance. Never have I had any spiritual experiences beforehand

Has anyone else experienced this kind of turmoil or disruption when first seriously inquiring into Orthodoxy? Any prayers, insight, or advice would be appreciated. I’m exhausted, but firm in my resolve to seek Christ.

I have never dated nor had my first kiss or anything and cannot date until all my surgeries are done, which sucks because my clock is ticking and I want to get married and have kids and all that jazz. But at minimum I am gonna be in my mid-late 20's by the soonest I can date and I don't want to end up alone in my 40's and neither do I want to settle with someone just because they tolerate me.

There are of course plenty of reasons I need those procedures done, but the central issue is that it affects basic relationships I am able to hold because even if someone sees me as a man, my brain doesn't, and I am repulsed by the idea of kissing someone while still being physically a woman in any way. I just wanna go on a boring movie date or an awkward coffee date with someone.

Well, my mother told me a couple of weeks back that she wants to rent a beach house for the three of us (myself, my little bro, and her) next summer. But I already told my doctors I am planning on getting top surgery and beginning bottom surgery next semester as my insurance will only allow me to do so after being on testosterone for 1 year. 

I hate interrupting my family's plans but I really need everything done before I turn 26. I want to be able to just get started actually living my life. I don't want to live like a priest forever.

My mother's health has been on the decline ever since she beat cancer a few years ago, and I know she'd be okay with delaying vacations for my surgeries, but I can't help but feel selfish over it.

Additionally, my little bro and I have a tradition of swimming past the drop-off and going snorkeling for a couple of hours. It's not a crazy swim, we only go about 3 miles at a time. Last time we were by some reefs and saw a morray eel and triggerfish, and it was awesome. I'd hate to say we can't do that next summer.

So WIBTA if I get my surgeries done and possibly disrupt my family's vacation plans?

“Night shift desk clerk needed. No experience necessary. Must be okay with solitude.”
The pay sucked, but I didn’t care. I called the number, expecting a voicemail or a dead end, but a man named Rick answered on the second ring. His voice sounded like gravel and cigarettes. After a couple of questions, he said, “You’re hired. Come by tonight. Midnight. Bring a jacket.” Then he gave me the address: Redwood Motel. Said it was on the edge of town.

I showed up around 11:50 PM. The place looked like something out of a horror movie—low one-story building in a U-shape, busted light fixtures, and a flickering red neon sign that read Redwood M tel. The “O” had long since burned out. The front office was dimly lit. It didn’t even look open.

When I stepped inside, the air felt… wrong. Not cold like air conditioning—cold like a freezer had been left open too long. Rick sat behind the desk looking like he hadn’t slept in years. He was thin, pale, eyes sunken and heavy, like he’d been carrying something way too heavy for way too long. He didn’t say “hello” or “welcome.” Just handed me a stained three-ring binder and a ring of room keys.

“You’ll cover midnight to seven,” he said, standing up. “No guests tonight. Should be quiet. But follow the rules.”
He tapped the binder with a yellowed fingernail. “Don’t screw around. Do exactly what it says.”
Then he left without another word.

I sat behind the desk and opened the binder. The pages were old, some stained with coffee, others with something darker. The first page was typed in all caps:
RULES FOR NIGHT STAFF – REDWOOD MOTEL.
Effective since 1997. Never revised. Never ignored.

I read through them once, then again. There were eight rules. Every single one gave me chills.

Don’t go into Room 313. Ever. If you hear whispering, tapping, or scratching from behind the door, ignore it. Don’t speak to it. Don’t knock back.

If the lobby phone rings between 2:33 AM and 2:44 AM, don’t answer it. The line is disconnected. There should be no calls.

Between 12:15 and 1:00 AM, a man in a black coat with no shoes will arrive. Give him the key to Room 106. Don’t look at his face. Don’t try to talk to him.

If a second man in a black coat shows up—do not speak. Go into the supply closet. Lock the door. Stay there until sunrise. And no matter what you hear, no matter what he says—do not answer him.

At exactly 3:00 AM, turn off every light in the lobby. Sit behind the desk. Stay completely still. You may feel breathing on your neck. Don’t move. Don’t make a sound. Don’t even breathe loudly. Wait until 3:13 AM before you turn the lights back on.

If you hear something tap on the front glass during that time, do not look at it. It can’t come in unless you see it.

Don’t leave the building before sunrise, even if someone screams for help. Even if they call your name. Even if they sound like your mother.

And the final rule:
If Room 313’s door is open, it is already too late.

I laughed nervously, trying to convince myself it was some weird motel tradition. Hazing the new guy, maybe. Some managers made you wear stupid uniforms. Rick gave you an insane list of ghost rules.

Then, at 12:22 AM, the bell above the front door jingled.

A man walked in. Black coat. No shoes. He left wet footprints on the floor as he stepped forward. He didn’t say a word. Didn’t blink. He just stood at the counter.

My hands were shaking, but I kept my eyes down. I slid the key to Room 106 across the counter. He took it, turned, and walked away. I let out a breath and looked up—only to catch his reflection in the glass.

He had no face.
Just a smooth, featureless blur, like someone had erased him with a wet sponge.

My body went cold. I couldn’t move for minutes.

Things were quiet for a while after that. At 2:33 AM, the phone rang.

I jumped so hard I nearly fell off the stool. The ring echoed through the empty lobby, sharp and urgent. It kept ringing and ringing. At one point, I swear I heard a second ring underneath it—coming from deeper inside the motel. Another phone.

I stared at the handset. My hands were sweating. But I didn’t touch it.

At exactly 2:44 AM, the ringing stopped.
That’s when I heard knocking.

It came from the hallway behind the front desk. Three slow knocks, then silence.

Then a voice.

“Hello?” it said.
“I’m locked out. I need help.”

It was my voice.

My knees went weak. I backed into the chair and gripped the arms to keep from collapsing. I looked at the binder again.

Even if they sound like your mother…

But it wasn’t my mother. It was me.

I did not respond. I did not move.

At 3:00 AM, I turned off every light in the lobby and ducked behind the desk. The darkness was immediate and absolute. I tried not to breathe too loud.

Then I felt it. Something had entered the room.

The air shifted. The hairs on my neck stood up. I could feel wet, raspy breathing right behind me. I didn’t dare turn around.

“You broke a rule,” a voice whispered.
It was right in my ear.
“You looked.”

I hadn’t said a word to anyone. But I had looked at the man’s reflection. That must’ve counted.

At 3:07, I heard a soft tapping sound—
Tap. Tap. Tap.
Coming from the glass in the front lobby. Then a long, slow scraping sound. Like fingernails down a window.

I shut my eyes. I curled into a ball and counted every second.

Finally, at 3:13, the lights flickered back on.

The tapping stopped. The room felt lighter. But outside the glass, the dirt was undisturbed. No footprints.

When Rick showed up that morning, he didn’t look surprised. Just handed me a coffee and muttered, “You’re still here. Good.”
I asked him how long the rules had been in place.

He stared out the window for a long time before he answered.

“Since the first time we lost someone. Back in ’97. Kid broke Rule One. Went into Room 313.”

I asked what was in there.

He said, “Not what. Who.”

I should’ve quit right then. But I didn’t. I came back the next night.

And that’s when I saw the hallway camera feed.

Room 313’s door was cracked open.

Not all the way—just a sliver.

I don’t know what came over me, but I had to see inside. Maybe it was curiosity. Maybe it was something else.

I walked down the hallway, past faded doors and buzzing lights. The numbers on the rooms seemed to disappear as I passed them, like they were being wiped clean behind me.

I reached Room 313.

The door creaked open at my touch. The smell of iron hit me immediately—blood.

The room was completely dark, except for a single chair sitting in the middle of the floor. Someone was sitting in it.

I stepped inside.
The door slammed shut behind me.

“You finally came,” said the person in the chair—using my voice.

The lights flickered on. The figure stood. It was me.
Same shirt. Same shoes. Same terrified eyes.

But its mouth opened too wide. Much too wide.

I screamed, and everything went black.

I woke up in the lobby at sunrise.

My reflection in the glass looked almost normal—just off by a fraction. My smile was wrong. My eyes blinked half a second too late.

Rick is gone now. I don’t know where.

There’s a new hire starting tomorrow.

I’ve already put the binder on the desk.

He’ll read the rules.

But he won’t understand them.

Not until he breaks one.

And by then…

It’ll already be too late.

1m8q711,https://www.reddit.com/r/YogaTeachers/comments/1m8q711/fellow_yoga_teachers_strange_question_here_about/,Fellow yoga teachers: strange question here about befriending outside the studio.,"So I’ve been teaching three years now. One of my two times weekly students whom I absolutely love is moving and changing his life and career path significantly. 

He let me know that yoga and my  teaching led him to this point to follow his heart and try an entirely new city and professional career. I was floored, honored and had a few tears of sadness plus joy when he explained his situation. He’s going into a beautiful healing profession but he has a doctorate in the sciences and a great paying job. He’s said he wants to live authentically and I know this new venture he will help sooo many lives. 

So this weekend one of our other yogi friends from the class is hosting a going away party. I said I’d be there. I want to. 

In the past several months I’ve said no to many offers for coffee, lunch, etc with all my students. Honestly I’ve been too busy and I don’t have the time. I also feel this slight weirdness about befriending students outside the studio? Like I just want to teach and not get too involved with the students personal lives. 

This student leaving now however has been with me three years twice weekly consistently.  He is beautiful soul and the fact that he told
Me yoga has changed his life and propelled him to a different direction; I am thinking I want to
Go
Celebrate him this weekend? I’ve watched him grow and evolve so much these past few years. 

Thinking I want to break my rule of not socializing with my students apart from the mat? 

Is this wrong ? Want to hear from

Laughed over coffee, cried over breakups, prayed over dreams.  
She knew everything about me—my secrets, my fears, my faith.

So when she went behind my back, when she shared something sacred I had trusted her with…  
It felt like being stabbed with words I never saw coming.

I didn’t scream. I didn’t confront her. I just… shut down.  
I started questioning everyone.  
*Can people be trusted?*  
*Was I naive for opening up?*

The hurt didn’t fade. It calcified.

One night, desperate for something—anything—I typed into Bible Chat AI:

That verse undid me.  
Jesus Himself was betrayed by someone He loved. He *gets it*.  
And He forgave.

Not because it didn’t hurt. But because holding onto pain doesn’t heal us—releasing it does.

**Scripture doesn’t dismiss our pain. It invites us to heal differently.**

**What would YOU do if your best friend betrayed you?**  
Would you let bitterness grow—or ask God for the strength to forgive?

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid. The vastness of regional differences that history and media introduced me to swept me away, making me endlessly fascinated in what many things this world seemed to have out there to be discovered and experienced. That was back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from halfway across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. Since then, I've been fortunate enough to have met people to exchange with, and I'd like to see if I can find that again.

I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost have a connection with. My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal. Location doesn't matter as much, as who that person is defines whether I'd like to engage with them or not. I do have a preference for cultural exchange, in which we can be introduced to different and new things. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpalling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. That being said, I'm increasingly interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be more open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into another or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time, so let's start with what works best for us.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you?

I'm 34, male, and live in the US (Michigan). Thoroughly introverted, with a deep desire to engage with those who can tap into that aspect of me. My personality is designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation. I'm potentially interested in many things with the right people and in the right environments, but left to my own devices, I always come back to the same core things.

*I strive to engage in genuine and thoughtful discussion.* Cognitive vibes are key for me. I do best with abstract minds that peak with ideation and whimsy, but don't think I'm so limited. Compatibility is a strange thing that feels most real when it's too fluid to be defined. We're compilations of potential that spark and enhance through engagement.

*Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine.* I'm an autodidact who's been passionate about a variety of pursuits since I've been young. I'm most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, but also that a lack or limitation is highly limiting. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me.* Personally, I write; about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

*I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee.* I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted.",1,1753418754.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

Hi! I have a small online business. Ask ko lang sa mga coffee seller, whats the fair markup for coffee beans. What percentage do you usually add on the base price?

If the beans itself plus packaging and supply shipping costs lets say is 500php in total, how much is the recommended price markup? Im currently on 20% but planning to adjust it to 18%. Given na wala akong physical store, though i will be registering it na so may 8% tax na ito 🥲 

I closed my shop kasi since holyweek since di nako masaya sa monthly increase ng kape sa ph. Sakto lang din markup ko kaya pag nag increase naaapektuhan talaga pricelist ko. But now im going back I am shock that it had increased so much. Like sobrang taas from what i remember nung holyweek GRABE!! 

Another info is theres so many roastery and farmers out there na ang ooffer ng mas mababang price but i tried almost all the cheapest suppliers, i am not satisfied. I cannot give my customers low quality beans just to be able to cater them and offer cheaper price (mostly but not all ng cafes actually lalo yung popup di talaga nila gets yung beans na natatanggap nila, like basta mura at mababudget nila go sila).

Bawi naman din ako sa presentation btw + its cheap kasi im an artist and crafter also so packaging wont be the problem sa costing. I have diskarte, its just that the beans are increasing so dalaaaas 🥲",1,1753418448.0,BusinessPH,1,1.0,False

Ben was… different. He remembered birthdays. Asked how your weekend actually went, and waited for the answer. When IT told us to log support tickets, Ben just walked over and fixed your monitor himself. He kept snacks in his drawer and shared them. He once stayed late to help me reformat a spreadsheet because I looked dangerously close to crying.

He never micromanaged. He trusted us. Defended us when upper-level VPs blamed us for delays that were clearly their own fault. Once, when two of us had overlapping emergencies, he quietly took over both workloads without saying a word.

Of course, some people didn’t like it. One senior manager said Ben was too soft. That he was blurring lines. Translation: Ben treated his team like humans.

So now he’s gone. Transferred to some client-facing role where he won’t be so hands-on.

Context: I have a long time HS friend whom I haven’t seen in a very long time.  We saw each other again in a friend’s birthday.   It was a casual get together with a very chill interaction.  

In HS, we were friends, we liked each other but not to the point that we engaged in a RS since we both prioritized our studies.    We went to separate cities for college.  Though we had some hi and hellos in FB over the years, that was it.   I’m not really into socmed especially FB, I have IG but I rarely post, follow or accept invites.  So we haven’t had any communication in a long time. 

After a few weeks, we saw each other again with friends.   This time, he really engaged me with his time.   Asked more personal questions and how I was…. asked me if I was single and I said yes.  He also told me he is in a current relationship with his gf of  4 years.   We did not discuss more of it but focused on where we were or have been doing to the past years.  That was it and I haven’t seen him for the next 1 and a half month.  

I got an invite from another mutual friend for some coffee and brunch together with some HS friends, he was there too when I arrived.  It was the usual get together like in HS as if years has not passed.   Again, he engaged me most of his time.  and this time he asked for my number and said that we should get together sometime.  I felt there was more about it coz I can sense it from his tone, body language and in his eyes.   He was a bit anxious but determined.  

I hesitated and told him flatly that his gf might be bothered about it and I don’t want to cause any trouble.   He said he was already single and no one will be bothered by me.  I was already about to leave that time so I just gave it to him without pressing for more details.  

That night, he messaged me to say that it was really nice seeing me again and said “good night” 

Two days later, he messaged me if he could call me over the phone.  I accepted his call and he asked me  if  we could meet in person just the two of us.  We met that afternoon in the same cafe and there he honestly told me his intention to pursue and court me.   Sabi nya, he was in love with me for as long as he can remember but didn’t get the chance to show and tell me.   This time he said, “ayaw ko na pakawalan ang chance na ito”.  

Nag paalam daw sya ng maayos sa former girlfriend and he said the truth about seeing me again and told her that he realized that I was really the reason why he couldn’t commit to marrying her or to attempt to propose to her since they were already both in the marrying age and has stable income. 

I just listened to what he had to say.   I told him I admire his honesty but did not promise or say anything about his courtship.  I asked him to give me time to digest the things he said and for me also for myself to reflect on this.   

The thing is, the feeling had always been mutual.  
But is it right to accept and let him court me when he just broke up with his gf just two months ago? 

I just received flowers by delivery this morning and I know, ako mag de decide eventually but I need inputs, advice or anything, point of views to help me settle this situation.

I hope that’s okay, these stories are all real and all mine. I have so many more moments I could write about and so many stories from my family‼️


I come from a long line of Spanish gypsies. The women in my family all of us have felt things, seen things, lived through moments that are hard to explain.

1- When I was just two years old, my godmother was staying with us. I used to play on her bed all the time, and one afternoon I was there, bouncing and giggling, completely full of joy. She walked in and asked, “Why are you laughing so much?” Without thinking, I said, “Grandad’s playing with me!”

She froze. Then she ran out and brought my mum back. They both stood in the doorway watching me as I kept bouncing and laughing. My godmother asked again who I was playing with, and I said, “Grandad! He’s doing the funny thing with his teeth!”

My grandad had false teeth, and when my older cousins were little, he used to loosen them and clack them around in his mouth to make them laugh. But here’s the thing he passed away when my mum was only three months pregnant with me. I never met him. I’d never even heard about him. My mum never talked about him, not even once.

The moment I said that, my mum just broke down. She scooped me up and hugged me tight, crying into my shoulder. I asked her what was wrong, and she whispered, “Nothing, baby. I’m just really happy you’re playing with your grandad.”



2 - Years later, when I first started dating my now husband, I used to stay over at his family’s house. Every time I walked past the garage, I’d see an old woman moving around inside. I didn’t say anything at first I didn’t want to scare him off. But after a couple of months, I finally told him, “I think there’s something in your garage.”

He gave me this look and said, “Yeah, sometimes I feel someone’s back there… in the back left corner.”
I hesitated and said, “That’s weird. I always feel it in the back right corner.”

He just stared at me and said, “That’s actually where I always feel it. I was trying to test you.”

Then it all made sense to me. I told him, “I think it’s your grandma. Do you want me to ask her something? Something only she would know?” So I did. And she answered. She told me she was watching over the family. That I’d be good for him. That she trusted me to take care of him. 

3- There was a time in high school that truly scared me. I started hearing voices not just one or two, but what felt like dozens, maybe even fifty, all speaking over each other in different languages, from different places. I couldn’t shut it off. I felt like I was being pulled in a hundred directions all at once.

I finally told my mum after a few weeks of this happening , we called in my nanna. The three of us did a full ritual candles, prayers, everything. My nanna is deeply spiritual, strong, and wise. When it was done, she looked at me and said, “You’re a vessel. They’re not trying to hurt you. They just want your help.”

I had to be blessed, protected, shielded — and slowly, the voices faded. But for a while there, I really thought I was losing my mind. It wasn’t until it all went quiet again that I realised… I’d just been open. Too open.

4-   then there was the night I’ll never forget. I was 11. We’d just moved back to New Zealand and were staying at my mum’s friend’s place. One night, I woke up and saw my Uncle Dennis standing over my mum while she slept. He leaned down, kissed her on the forehead, and said, “Everything’s going to be alright.”

Then he turned and saw me awake. He walked over, crouched by my bed, gave me a big hug, and kissed my head. “I’ll always be here to take care of you, poppet,” he said. He was the only person who ever called me that.

And then he was gone.

The next morning, I walked into the kitchen while Mum was making her coffee. I said, “Uncle Dennis passed away last night.” She stared at me, then rushed to call my aunt.

He’d died at 3:40am.

My aunt asked how we knew. My mum just said, “Tiana saw him say goodbye.”",13,1753417221.0,Ghoststories,0,1.0,False
