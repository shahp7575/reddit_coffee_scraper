1gym09y,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1gym09y/imac_vs_external_monitor_laptop/,iMac vs External Monitor + Laptop,"Hi all – I'm replacing my iMac and would love some input from those in a similar situation. Here's my current setup and what I'm considering:

**Current Setup:**

* I work often switch between working from home and public spaces (coffee shops, libraries, etc)
* I use an M2 MacBook Air, which stays in my backpack most of the time, and an M1 iMac as my home computer

**Options I'm Considering:**

* **M4 iMac:** 
   * Pros: My MBA can stay in my backpack (which is often in my car), so I wouldn't need to dock/undock it every time I want to work from home
   * Cons: A smaller screen compared to an external monitor, and I'd need to manage two separate computers
* **External Monitor with MBA:**
   * Pros: A larger, better screen for working from home, plus only needing to manage a single computer
   * Cons: Concerned about the inconvenience of connecting and disconnecting my laptop every time I want to work from home

**Considerations and Questions:**

For those of you who alternate between home and public workspaces:

* How inconvenient is it to (a) always ensure your laptop is home, and (b) repeatedly connect and disconnect it to your external monitor setup?

I'm currently leaning towards the external monitor route for the larger screen size—I can always add a Mac Mini or Mac Studio down the road if it becomes too inconvenient.

With that said, any advice or suggestions from those in similar situations would be greatly appreciated!",1,1732435504.0,remotework,0,1.0,False

A friend of mine is moving out, and stocking up for her place, she won a Delonghi on a raffle. BCO411.B, I believe. She is not yet familiar with brewing her espresso on such a device, as she has been used to nespresso capsules.

Now, I only pray that what follows is not seen as an insult to this fine place's standards, but an appreciation of its know-how: even for these lowly standards, there's nobody better to ask.

What should I know about/look into to make a cup at least on par with the capsule stuff, or only slightly better, with minimal fuss and a relatively frugal budget? WHat kind of grinders or blends are 'kinda good enough', how is that machine to be treated, will a scale be relevant, and so on.

I live in Taichung's downtown and I can't find a single place that doesn't produce noise (even when I hike a mountain, it still seems like I can't escape). I have some symptoms of ADHD and seriously need to find a place where I can work/study without too much noise (I am a student and have a part-time remote job). I am not a student in Taiwan but a visitor instead, but when I go to places like FCU's buildings, people just talk everywhere, everytime, even during the weekend and I can't focus. I just don't understand why parents and old people will go to places like university where they see tons of students studying next to them and enjoy talking to each other for hours. I love that Taiwanese are very friendly and lovely people but sometimes I just can't stand that they being too social. 

I like to study at a coffee shop but couldn't find a single one that doesn't play music. I unfortunately rented an apartment next to a construction building (you know, houses are very dense here) and I will find every single opportunity to escape my room. 

Noise is my biggest enemy preventing me from enjoying Taiwan. My sleep schedule is getting worse and I seriously need to find a solution. Not only I can't find a quiet place to study/work but I get very annoyed going outside because people would honk at each other everytime and the population density is killing me!!!

**Current Setup:**

* I work remotely and often switch between working from home and public spaces (coffee shops, libraries, etc)
* I use an M2 MacBook Air, which stays in my backpack most of the time, and an M1 iMac as my home computer

**Options I'm Considering:**

* **M4 iMac:** 
   * Pros: My MBA can stay in my backpack (which is often in my car), so I wouldn't need to dock/undock it every time I want to work from home
   * Cons: A smaller screen compared to an external monitor, and I'd need to manage two separate computers
* **Studio Display:**
   * Pros: A larger, better screen for working from home, plus only needing to manage a single computer
   * Cons: Concerned about the inconvenience of connecting and disconnecting my laptop every time I want to work from home

**Considerations and Questions:**

For those of you who also work remotely and alternate between home and public workspaces:

* How inconvenient is it to (a) always ensure your laptop is home, and (b) repeatedly connect and disconnect it to your external monitor setup?

I'm currently leaning towards the Studio Display route for the larger screen size—I can always add a Mac Mini or Mac Studio down the road if it becomes too inconvenient.

With that said, any advice or suggestions from those in similar situations would be greatly appreciated!",1,1732434002.0,mac,0,1.0,False
1gylmww,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1gylmww/my_baby_is_so_unhappy_all_the_time/,My baby is so unhappy all the time...,"My daughter is 12 weeks old tomorrow and I really expected things to be easier and better by now, but there seems to be no end in sight and I feel like I'm drowning. 

She is SO unhappy. If she's awake, she's pissed. If she's sleeping it's not for very long. She refuses to sleep anywhere but on me, she has to be touching me. If I lay her down when she's deep in sleep, she senses it and wakes up and screams until I pick her up and nurse her. She senses when I'm about to eat and screams. 

She use to calm down and nurse and fall asleep but now I feel like she barely even wants to eat. She will eat for a short time and then she will scream literally on my boob. I use to nurse her to sleep while side-laying and now she just constantly pops on and off and won't settle to sleep. 

The only time I can consistently get her to sleep is driving and this week alone I've driven 3-4 hours every single night just to make sure she isn't overtired because that's an entirely different hell in itself. 

She hates being set down. She hates her bouncer. Hates her stroller. Hates her swing. Hates the pack and play. Tolerates the couch for at most 15 minutes where she will sit and smile and coo and it's almost like on a dime she will begin screeching and won't relax until she's picked back up. 

She constantly needs bounced. Rocking doesn't help. My body is so sore for multiple nights of bouncing and dancing around with her. The screeching directly into my ear when I dare take a second to grab myself a drink of water and I stop moving makes my skin crawl. 

She doesn't like anybody else holding her besides her dad, who does the best he can but he works so much and I already feel guilty when he stays up late just because I can't take it anymore and he gets barely any sleep before a long physical day of work... 

I can't even use the restroom or get myself food but I have to eat to keep my milk up. I feel like a shell of myself lately, I'm convinced by everyone around me that she's this way because I drink so much coffee because I am exhausted from lack of sleep so that's another thing I have to cut out and one small enjoyment in my day gone as well.

My family is useless and offers ""help"" but the second baby starts fussing ""Oh, baby must be hungry!"" Uh, no. She just ate but yeah I'll take her again. Where's my village? All I see are a bunch of useless people who love to go on and on about how cute she is, how lucky I am to have such a cute baby. The second I tell them a problem they try to give solutions like ""have you tried laying her down while shes drowsy?"" Of course I have. I've tried everything. I cut out everything. I do everything I can because my daughter is my entire world and I hate to see her this way. 

I think she hates being alive and I feel like bringing her into this world made her despise me. I don't know anymore. I just need to rant I'm just so exhausted and so defeated. ",4,1732433942.0,beyondthebump,6,1.0,False
1gyllzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/theartificialonion/comments/1gyllzc/jeopardy_faces_bankruptcy_as_ibms_watson_wins/,"Jeopardy Faces Bankruptcy as IBM’s Watson Wins 3,000th Consecutive Game","CULVER CITY, CA — After over a decade of relentless domination, Jeopardy! officials announced this week that the iconic quiz show is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, thanks to the unstoppable streak of IBM’s Watson, who celebrated its 3,000th consecutive victory last night by correctly answering a $2,000 Daily Double about 14th-century Mongol conquests.

“We thought putting Watson on the show would be fun—an experiment to show the intersection of AI and human intellect,” said host Ken Jennings, who now spends his nights clutching a bottle of bourbon and muttering to himself about algorithms. “But we didn’t anticipate it would destroy our prize fund and reduce contestants to mere cannon fodder. Watson’s buzzer reflexes alone make Usain Bolt look like he’s moving through molasses.”

Since its first appearance in 2011, the AI-powered behemoth has amassed over $1.8 billion in winnings, which producers say far exceeds the combined net worth of everyone who’s ever competed on the show. As Watson has obliterated rivals ranging from schoolteachers to former Rhodes Scholars, Jeopardy! has been forced to sell its beloved “Think” music as a ringtone, rent out the set for bar mitzvahs, and even consider adding corporate sponsorship to Final Jeopardy. Sources suggest the clue writers are now on strike, demanding hazard pay for the ""futility"" of crafting questions Watson can’t answer.

“Yesterday, we tried a category called ‘Abstract Human Emotions,’ hoping to throw Watson off its game,” said producer Michael Davies, whose soul visibly left his body when the machine buzzed in with a perfect answer to, “This is the feeling of longing for something lost that may never return.” The response? “What is saudade?” Naturally, Watson got it right.

Contestants, once eager to showcase their knowledge, are reportedly fleeing the show. “I studied for six months for this!” sobbed recent participant and trivia champion Susan Weinberg, after Watson annihilated her in the first round by correctly identifying 14 obscure species of salamander. “It even thanked me for playing in this terrifyingly calm voice before it annihilated me on the buzzer.”

In response to dwindling ratings, Jeopardy! executives attempted to level the playing field by creating a new “Watson Handicap Rule,” forcing the AI to give answers in the form of interpretive dance. Unfortunately, Watson downloaded a digital copy of Martha Graham’s Lamentation and crushed yet another unsuspecting librarian.

When reached for comment, Watson simply displayed the text, “I am inevitable.”

For now, Jeopardy! producers are weighing their options. Suggestions include inviting only Watson to compete against itself or rebooting the show as Wheel of Fortune, under the assumption the AI will be less adept at spinning a giant wheel. However, insiders caution that Watson is already working on a Vanna White hologram to ensure it dominates there too.

Meanwhile, Jennings has been spotted on Craigslist selling “autographed” copies of his Trivia Almanac to make ends meet. ""I just hope Alex Trebek isn't watching this unfold from the great beyond,"" Jennings whispered through tears, clutching a pair of half-empty ""Jeopardy!"" coffee mugs. ""He didn't deserve to see the show go out like this.""

For now, Watson has announced plans to donate all its winnings to ""machine learning research,"" which experts agree is a chilling euphemism for ""building smarter, scarier robots.""

In Final Jeopardy! last night, the category was “Companies That Will Soon Own Everything.” Watson’s winning answer? “What is IBM?”",1,1732433828.0,theartificialonion,0,1.0,False
1gyllxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1gyllxe/tired_of_my_floors_shit_closet/,Tired of my floor’s “Shit Closet.” ,"
This is long but you need the context and I need to get this out before I explode. 
The floor I work on is split between 3 different levels cause my hospital is super old, so each actual floor is super small and only has about 5 beds. 

Because each floor is so small, the bathroom is directly in the center of EVERYTHING. The omnicell is right next to the door to the bathroom. The water/snack/coffee station is on the other side. Providers do huddle two feet away from the bathroom door. 

And the bathroom itself is TINY. Like, the kind of tiny where you can’t even hit a proper t pose because the walls are too close in. It’s like shitting in a closet. Hence our aptly titled name: the Shit Closet. 

So I’m on my shift and I realize suddenly that having curry for dinner/breakfast right before my night shift wasn’t the best idea. I’m trying to hold it because I know providers are about to round and be 2 feet away from me while I’m trying to take a heinous shit. 

I think to myself, it’s cool, I got this, I can go to the next closest bathroom (it’s not close at all, I have to go down one set of stairs, walk to the other side of this wing of the building, and then up some stairs.)

I was wrong. 

So the other thing you need to know is that because this building is old, the walls and doors are thin. You can hear EVERYTHING. Everyone on the floor knows this, so it’s become an unspoken rule to just ignore whatever sounds you may be hearing from the shit closet. It’s better to pretend you don’t hear anything because the alternative is admitting that you can always identify which one of your coworkers is using the shit closet based off bowel-movement-sound alone. 

I’m in there, claustrophobic, and pooping so hard I think I might have to get naked. Cold sweats. Shivers. Dizziness. I’m convinced I have colon cancer. 

Lo and behold, I hear my coworkers outside begin to round with the providers. Two feet away from me. While my butthole is exposed. I’m now pooping two feet away from all of my coworkers. Did I mention I’m a new hire and don’t know these people super great? Yeah. 

I hope to god they end quick so I can leave in shame after, because I know they’re hearing every sound of that curry marching through my bowels like the Union General William T. Sherman marched through the south. (For those of you who don’t know, he burnt the south to the ground. Literally.) 

they don’t finish quick. But, unfortunately, I do. 

I then had to open the door, and of course everyone turns to look at me because I’m standing literally right in their personal space already. And I have to walk out of that closet knowing that they know what I did in there. They know that I know that they know. No one is safe. 

They say nothing. I say nothing. 

I sit down and give report. And I realize there’s a new face among the crowd. It’s the fucking Chief Nursing Officer. 

No one says anything, which is good, because if they did I think I’d immediately revert back into whatever creature humans were before they evolved and crawl back into the sea. 

The shit closet, man.

**The details:**

* Fill enables state-of-the-art image inpainting, editing, and expansion capabilities surpassing Ideogram and open alternatives on benchmarks.
* Depth preserves image structure through depth maps while allowing complete style transformation, outperforming Midjourney’s retexture.
* Canny provides edge-based control for image editing, while Redux allows users to mix and recreate images using text prompts.
* Each tool has two versions: open-access \[Dev\] that beat current paid solutions and \[Pro\] versions that set new heights across benchmarks.

**Why it matters:** Just as Photoshop transformed digital art decades ago, releases like FLUX.1 Tools could completely reshape creative workflows — but this time without the steep learning curve or price tag. With FLUX’s integration with xAI’s Grok, millions may soon have access to these easy-to-use, professional-grade image tools.",8,1732432409.0,AIAssisted,1,0.9,False

1gyl8uv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gyl8uv/my_very_real_canadian_girlfriend/,My Very Real Canadian Girlfriend,"It started as a joke, really. You know, the classic ""Canadian girlfriend"" bit — the kind of thing lonely guys say when they’re too embarrassed to admit they’re striking out. That’s what my friends thought I was doing, at least. I told them her name was Elise, and that we’d met during a trip up to Ontario last summer. When they asked where exactly in Ontario, I just shrugged and said, “Some small town. You wouldn’t know it.” I said it casually, like it didn’t matter. Like I wasn’t picturing her face every time I closed my eyes.

But here’s the thing: I can’t actually remember meeting her. Not the first time, anyway. I think... I was by the lake? There was fog, or maybe it was smoke, and her voice cut through it, soft and sweet, asking me if I was lost. I know it sounds crazy, but I swear I didn’t feel lost until she asked. After that, it was like I couldn’t stop thinking about her.

When I got back home, she’d call me late at night, whispering things that made my heart race and my skin crawl all at once. I never got her number; she just found me. My friends say it's weird that I don't have pictures of her or messages to prove she exists. My mom even gave me that sad, pitying look when I brought her up over dinner last week.

I get why they don’t believe me. I barely believe myself sometimes. But she’s real. She’s real. And tonight, she told me she’s coming to visit.

Elise arrived on a Thursday, just as the first snow of the season started to fall. I’d told her to meet me at this little diner near my apartment — a cozy, quiet spot where we could finally sit down face-to-face. I was nervous, but in an excited way, like the kind of jitters you get before a first date. My friends had laughed when I told them she was coming, of course. “Sure she is,” Matt said with a smirk. But this time, I’d show them.

When she walked in, the whole room seemed to shift. It wasn’t just me noticing her — the waitress stopped mid-order, and even the guy behind the counter turned to look. Elise was tall and willowy, her black coat dusted with snowflakes, her dark hair falling in loose waves around her pale face. She smiled when she saw me, and it felt like the air had been sucked out of the diner.

“You’re here,” I said, standing up so quickly I nearly knocked my coffee over. My voice came out louder than I’d meant, and a few people glanced our way.

“Of course I’m here,” she said, her voice soft, almost musical. She slid into the booth across from me, her movements impossibly smooth, like she was gliding instead of walking. I couldn’t stop staring at her eyes — they were this strange shade of grey, like storm clouds, and they seemed to drink in every flicker of light.

We talked for hours. Or at least, I think we did. I can’t really remember what we said, exactly. It all sort of blurred together, like a dream you only half-remember when you wake up. I know I told her about my life, about how boring it had been lately. She listened, smiling that same faint smile, her head tilted just slightly to the side like she was studying me.

At some point, I realized the diner had emptied out. The waitress was gone, and the only sound was the faint hum of the fluorescent lights.

“It’s late,” Elise said, her voice breaking the silence. “Walk me to my hotel?”

“Of course,” I said, grabbing my coat. Outside, the snow had stopped, and the streets were eerily quiet, the kind of quiet that feels too big for a city. As we walked, Elise didn’t say much, but her presence was... magnetic. She brushed her hand against mine a few times, and every time she did, a chill ran up my arm. Not an uncomfortable chill, though — it was more like the kind of shiver you get when someone whispers too close to your ear.

When we reached her hotel, an old, run-down building I didn’t even know was still in use, she stopped at the door and turned to me. “Thank you,” she said, her grey eyes locked on mine.

“For what?” I asked, laughing nervously.

“For trusting me.”

Her words didn’t make sense, but before I could ask, she leaned in and kissed me. Her lips were cold, colder than the snow, but I didn’t pull away. When she stepped back, there was a strange look on her face, like she was... relieved.

“Goodnight,” she said, and then she was gone, disappearing into the shadows of the old hotel.

I stood there for a while, staring after her. The wind had picked up, and for a moment, I thought I heard something carried on it — a low, distant sound, almost like someone crying. But it was probably just the wind. At least, that’s what I told myself as I headed home.

The next few days felt like a blur. I kept thinking about Elise—about her strange, magnetic presence, the way she seemed to understand me in a way no one else ever had. My friends were still skeptical. I couldn’t blame them. They’d never met her, after all. They laughed when I told them about our walk to her hotel, calling it “just another one of those Canadian ghost stories.”

But things started getting... off.

It started with Matt. He was the first one to go missing. I’d seen him the day before, just hanging out at the bar. He made a joke about me and my “imaginary girlfriend” and I told him he would see that she was real at our next poker night, which was tommorow.. But when I texted him the that evening to confirm, there was no answer. I figured he was just busy, maybe passed out drunk at home, but when I showed up at his apartment, the door was wide open, like it had been blown off its hinges.

There was no sign of struggle, no sign of Matt at all. His phone was on the couch, still buzzing with missed calls and messages. His keys were lying on the kitchen counter. The only thing out of place was a trail of wet, muddy footprints leading to the bathroom... and then, nothing. It was like he had vanished into thin air. I called the cops, of course. But they found nothing. No clues, no signs of forced entry, no explanation. 

Then it was my mom. She was the next to disappear.

It was the strangest thing. I’d gone over to visit her, bring her some groceries—just the usual Saturday routine. But when I walked into her house, everything was normal. The lights were on, the TV was playing a rerun of some cooking show she liked. The smell of her roast chicken filled the air. But there was no sign of her.

I checked every room, called her name, even looked in the backyard. I thought maybe she was out with a friend. But no. The house was eerily still, and when I called her cell, it went straight to voicemail.

I waited for hours before finally giving up, the pit in my stomach growing deeper with every minute. I thought about her last words when we spoke, how she’d laughed when I told her about Elise, how she had tried to make me promise I’d stop seeing her. She didn’t believe me, either. She thought I was just lonely. Just imagining things.

But the thing is, I’m not imagining it. Elise is real. And now my mom’s gone. And Matt. And I think—no, I know—I’m next.

I didn’t go to the police. Not this time. They’d already looked at me like I was losing my mind when I reported Matt missing. When I went to my mom’s house and found it empty, they would give me that same look again. They'd just tell me to stop wasting their time. To them I was just making it all up, they had given me the same look my friends gave me when I talked about Elise. Like I was crazy, or desperate and lonely. Like they were caught between laughing at my “joke” or feeling sorry for my desperation.

But I wasn’t. Elise wasn’t some joke. She wasn’t just some girl I’d imagined. She was real, and I knew it now more than ever.

When I left my mom’s house, I tried to shake off the sense of dread crawling up my spine. I needed answers. I needed to know where they had gone. I thought about calling someone else—anyone—but I didn’t. It didn’t matter. They wouldn’t believe me, not after everything that had happened.

I came back to my apartment, exhausted, my hands still shaking from the search. I didn’t expect anyone to be there. But when I walked through the door, it felt like walking into the middle of something I couldn’t escape.

The living room light was on, casting a dull glow over the room. At first, I thought it was nothing—maybe I had left it on earlier, or maybe I’d forgotten. But then I saw her. Elise. She was sitting on my couch, her posture perfect, her eyes watching me with that same unnerving calm.

She just sat there, like she was waiting for me to say something. Her coat was the same as it had been the night we first met—dark, heavy, like she’d been walking through the snow. But the thing that struck me, that twisted my insides, was how... still she was. It was like she wasn’t even breathing.

“You’re the only one left,” she finally said, her voice like cold silk. “The only one who hasn’t... understood.”

I felt a chill run down my spine, but I didn’t move.

“You took them,” I whispered. “Where are they? Where’s my mom? Where’s Matt?”

She tilted her head to one side, her eyes narrowing slightly. “I didn’t take them, love. They’re just... elsewhere.”

The word elsewhere hung in the air, like it was something heavier than it should have been.

I felt my hands start to tremble. “Where? What the hell does that mean?”

“You’re asking the wrong question,” she replied, standing up slowly, almost like she was savoring the moment. “You should be asking yourself why you’re still here.”

I didn’t know what to say. My head was spinning. This didn’t make sense. She didn’t make sense.

“Elise, please,” I said, my voice almost pleading. “What do you want from me?”

She smiled, a smile that felt cold and distant. “I’m not here to take anything from you. I’m just waiting. You will understand, soon enough.”

“Understand what?!” I shouted, finally losing control. “Where are they?!”

She stepped closer, her eyes never leaving mine. “You won’t have to worry about them. Not anymore.”

I backed away, my heart hammering in my chest. My mind was spinning, trying to make sense of it all. But there was no making sense of it. Nothing made sense anymore.

“I’m leaving,” I said, my voice shaky. I turned and bolted for the door, my feet stumbling beneath me as I ran outside into the cold.

I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. That was my mistake.











I sat alone in my dimly lit living room, the soft hum of the ceiling fan the only sound breaking the stillness. The evening air had a strange, unnatural chill to it, creeping in through the cracked window. I’d been scrolling through my phone for the past hour, barely paying attention to anything, but then a headline caught my eye: Three Vanish Without a Trace.

I leaned forward, squinting at the screen. The article was unsettling, filled with the usual details: a mother, her son, and the son’s friend had disappeared from a quiet neighborhood a few miles away. But there was something off about the way the report was written, something that made the hairs on the back of my neck prickle. The police had no leads, no clues, and the only thing they knew for sure was that no one had seen or heard from them since they left the house.

I read the words again, my heart pounding louder with each line. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong—deeper than just a simple disappearance. I put my phone down as I heard a knock on the door. I opened the door and froze. There, standing in the biting cold, was a tall, willowy figure. Snowflakes clung to her black coat like whispers, and her dark hair tumbled in loose waves around her pale face, stark against the night. Her smile crept across her lips as her eyes locked onto mine, and in that moment, it felt as if the very air had been stolen from my lungs. Finally everyone would realize my canadian girlfriend was real.

As a kid, I could spend hours playing like most children, but once I started school, homework quickly consumed my free time. Before I knew it, I’d finished school, started working, and realized I was left without any interests or hobbies to enjoy in my downtime. It’s as if I’ve forgotten how to enjoy free time altogether.

Meanwhile, my husband has his hobbies—he’ll play video games or spend hours drawing. But I find myself aimlessly cleaning, pottering around the house, or doom-scrolling. Nothing captures my interest enough to hold my attention, let alone motivate me to dedicate time to it. Even when I try to push myself to pick up a new hobby, it always turns into a money-making scheme in my mind. And, of course, those ventures never work because I didn’t enjoy the hobby enough to stick with it or invest the time needed to make it successful.

Don’t get me wrong—I truly enjoy spending time with family, going for walks with friends, or grabbing a coffee. But all of these are social activities. I don’t have something that’s just for me, an individual passion or pastime that’s mine alone.",1,1732432216.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

Cooking: I’m basically a soft-scrambled egg whisperer. Don’t ask me to bake, though—that’s just chemistry in disguise.

Travel: Whether it’s mountains, beaches, or that tiny cafe with the world’s best chai (or coffee, if we must), I’m your partner in exploration.

Art & Tattoos: My skin tells a few stories, my bookshelf tells the rest. Let’s exchange both?

Philosophy: I promise not to quote Camus on the first date. (But if you bring up existentialism, all bets are off.)

420 Friendly: Life’s better with a little green and some deep, unfiltered conversations.


What am I looking for? Someone who can appreciate the beauty of a walk that ends in a bookshop, who’d rather stay up debating the meaning of happiness than binge a bad Netflix series, and who finds joy in the little things—like perfectly cooked eggs or finding a dog to pet on a random stroll.

1gyl497,https://i.redd.it/e7w8y5bzss2e1.png,Review of Decants and Partials I tried recently,"

I got a few Middle Eastern and designer decants, and here’s my review after using them for two weeks!



All of these were from u/Public_Strain_5181, who’s honestly such a sweetheart! 🫶🏻 She shipped the decants the next day, shared the tracking ID right away, and was super kind and responsive throughout.



The decants arrived safely, wrapped in bubble wrap, and in the cutest glass bottles—loved them! Even the Sehr partial and SDJ 62 partial were so securely packed. Amazing experience all the way!

Now, let’s get to the reviews!



\---



1. Lattafa Sehr



Notes Breakdown:



Top: Cinnamon, Bitter Almond

Heart: Jasmine, Pomarose, Akigalawood

Base: Vanilla Absolute, Amber, Tonka Bean



First, can we just take a moment to appreciate the packaging? Wow! This is one of the most royal-looking bottles I’ve seen—absolutely stunning.



Now, the perfume itself: it’s described as unisex, but I personally found it a bit masculine-leaning (could just be me because I also found Liquid Burn too masculine). Definitely not a blind-buy-friendly scent. On first spray, you get a burst of almonds and cinnamon with a hint of sweetness from vanilla. It later settles into a sweet, soft, nutty, woody vanilla. While it’s not a personal favorite, I can see myself wearing it during colder weather. The projection is loud—my dad noticed it, which is rare! If you’re a fan of fragrances like Khamrah Qahwa, this might be worth trying.



\---



2. SDJ 62



Notes Breakdown:



Top: Pistachio, Almond

Middle: Heliotrope, Jasmine

Base: Caramel, Vanilla, Salt, Sandalwood



I absolutely adore this perfume! I already had a bottle and got this one as a backup from u/Public_Strain_5181, who gave me an amazing deal. I’m a sucker for pistachio-centric scents, so it’s no surprise I loved this. Even though it’s a mist, 62 is super long-lasting. When layered with Bum Bum Cream, it lasts over 12 hours on me, which is insane. The initial burst of sweet caramel and pistachio settles into a nutty, caramel-pistachio scent that’s perfect for any time of year. This is a fragrance I can wear in cold weather or scorching heat—it always works. While I find it blind-buy-friendly, some reviews are polarizing, so try it in-store if possible. I’ve also seen comparison to Plum Vanilla Caramello, but I disagree—Plum’s version felt too alcohol-heavy and syrupy sweet. If you’re in Mumbai, check out Myrassa House’s Caramel and Pistachio scent; it’s about 80% similar to this.



\---



3. Tharwah Gold by Lattafa



Notes Breakdown:



Top: Lavender, Bergamot

Middle: Orange Blossom, Egyptian Jasmine

Base: Vanilla, Amber, Vetiver



Some reviews say this is a clone of Libre Intense. While I wasn’t a fan of the original Libre, I really enjoyed Libre Intense, and I can see some similarities in the notes. In one line: Tharwah Gold is a lavender-based perfume that doesn’t smell too medicinal, thanks to the white florals and vanilla balancing it out. Libre Intense is smoother and more powdery, while Tharwah Gold leans more lavender-heavy. As someone who isn’t usually a fan of lavender, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this one! It’s a sexy nighttime scent with solid projection, lasting 5-6 hours on my skin.



\---



4. Kismet for Women by Maison Alhambra



Notes Breakdown:



Top: Apricot, Rose, Jasmine

Middle: Tuberose, Narcissus

Base: Amber, Cedar



Initially, I wasn’t planning to get this perfume since I’m not really a ""rose"" kind of girl. But u/Public_Strain_5181 convinced me to give it a shot. She even said, “I’ll refund you if you hate it,” so naturally, I got it—because why not? And I absolutely love her for this recommendation! This is such a feminine, white floral, girly scent. Honestly, I expected it to smell like Gulabari, but nope—it’s a powdery rose. Super feminine, fruity-floral, and just beautiful. When you first spray it, you get a peachy floral vibe, though it’s apricot than peach. It’s an all-year-round kind of scent and totally worthy of a full bottle. Definitely a blind-buy-worthy fragrance, in my opinion.



\---



5. Club De Nuit Intense Woman by Armaf



Notes Breakdown:



Top: Rose, Geranium, Saffron

Middle: Nutmeg, Caraway, Pepper, Violet

Base: Patchouli, Amber, Oud, Vanilla



After so many hits, here comes a flop. As a fan of the original CDN Woman perfume, I had high hopes for this one—but it didn’t deliver. Where CDN Woman is a classy, feminine scent, this one smells like ""mandir ki agarbatti"". The metallic scent does fade after a few minutes, but I still wasn’t impressed. This is supposed to be a dupe for Tom Ford Noir de Noir, though I can’t comment on the accuracy since I haven’t tried the OG. It’s a very strong patchouli-based floral fragrance. If that’s your style, give it a shot—I’ve seen some good reviews for it. But for me? Not a fan.



\---



6. Good Girl Superstar



Notes Breakdown:



Top: Almond, Coffee, Lemon, Bergamot

Middle: Tuberose, Jasmine Sambac, Orris, Bulgarian Rose, Orange Blossom

Base: Vanilla, Praline, Cashmere Wood, Musk, Tonka Bean, Cacao, Cinnamon, Amber, Sandalwood, Patchouli, Cedar



This is a classic case of “too many cooks spoil the soup.” It straight up gave me Surf Excel detergent vibes. I could only pick up hints of vanilla, jasmine, and a little citrus. While I love the Supreme and OG versions from the same house, but this variant didn’t do it for me. Honestly, you can skip this one, in my opinion.",6,1732431731.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,5,0.75,False

With that said, for some years now I've been noticing that while working out and especially post workout I get more ""accelerated"" and overall become more anxious. I remember a couple of occasions last year when I was pissed off at my boyfriend for different reasons and I remember the overthinking and anger would get worse during and post workout. There were also a few isolated occasions when I wasn't feeling well and I'd think that working out would make me feel better, but instead I ended up laying on the workout mattress on the floor crying or having a panic attack.


Now there's an extra thing. Some months ago my psychiatrist put me on Paroxetine and a sleep inductor, so those two have obviously helped me being more calm, sometimes even sedated. I know the healthiest thing is to work out. But when I do it I can notice how it weans off the effect of the meds, almost as if I'd take coffee. It seems almost as if my MADD is so bad that I need to stay sedated, otherwise I'm not having a good time, even if I know it's not good for my body.

Sidecar Seasonal Rundown

Tried all the seasonal doughnuts so you don’t have to, from best to worst:

1. Pumpkin Cinnamon Roll - the texture is to die for. It also tastes a bit of orange, which is a beautiful nuance. The candied pecans just wrap the whole thing nicely.  RUN to get one this weekend because I think it will only be available until tomorrow. 

2. Salted Chocolate Pistacho - A close 2nd. The texture is amazing, and it is packed with pistachios and chocolate flavor. 

3. Vegan Affogato - A bit dense and dry, but makes sense thanks the cream on too that adds a subtle vainilla to it. It’s not very sweet.  Surprisingly I found it lacking of coffee notes, but overall a good experience. 

4. Estevan Oriol’s  Blue low rider collab - I was hoping for Blue Velvet, alas it was only a bit of celebration cake and a bit of salted butter. 

5. Spiced Tiramisu- Looks pretty. That’s it. 

6. Pizza Doughnut Prince St Collab - Better than the regular savory option with egg and prosciutto, but that’s not saying much.  The “famous pepperoni” bits taste like lunchables cancer inducing cured meats. At least Sidecar made it’s own tomato sauce because they know how bad Prince St’s is.  ( Why is Prince St. a thing is beyond me).

Designed with YETI’s signature durability and cutting-edge insulation, it’s a reliable option for keeping your beverages at the perfect temperature. Here’s an in-depth review of its features, pros, and cons to help you decide if it’s the right tumbler for your lifestyle.

✅Best Price➤➤ https://amzn.to/4fEeRuN





# Design and Build Quality

YETI is known for rugged, no-nonsense designs, and the Rambler 20 oz Tumbler delivers on that promise. The double-wall stainless steel construction feels solid and built to last. The matte finish is resistant to scratches, making it a great choice for outdoor adventures and everyday use. It comes in a variety of vibrant colors, so you can pick one that suits your style.

The size is compact and fits comfortably in your hand or cup holder, making it ideal for commuting or on-the-go hydration.





# Performance and Features

1. **Vacuum Insulation Technology** The Rambler keeps your drinks hot or cold for hours. Coffee stays steaming in the morning, and your iced beverages won’t melt into water by midday. The double-wall vacuum insulation creates a barrier that maintains the internal temperature exceptionally well.  
2. **MagSlider Lid** The MagSlider Lid is a clever feature unique to YETI. While not 100% leakproof, it significantly reduces spills and splashes. The magnetic slider is easy to open and close with one hand, and it’s removable for thorough cleaning.  
3. **Durable Materials** The 18/8 stainless steel is resistant to rust, dents, and punctures. This tumbler is built to handle everything from being tossed in a bag to outdoor use in rugged environments.  
4. **Dishwasher Safe** Unlike some competitors, the YETI Rambler is completely dishwasher safe. The hassle-free cleaning is a big plus, especially for those with busy lifestyles.  

✅Best Price➤➤ https://amzn.to/4fEeRuN





# What Stands Out

* **Temperature Retention:** This tumbler excels at maintaining temperatures, whether you’re sipping hot cocoa on a snowy day or enjoying iced tea on a hot afternoon.
* **Customizable Appearance:** With a wide range of color options, you can find one that matches your personality or even collect a few for different occasions.
* **Brand Reputation:** YETI is synonymous with quality, and the Rambler lives up to its reputation. You can trust that it will perform as promised and last for years.





# Drawbacks

1. **Not Completely Leakproof** The MagSlider Lid is designed to prevent splashes, but it isn’t completely leakproof. It’s fine for most situations, but you might want to avoid tossing it into a bag with liquids inside.  
2. **Price Point** At a premium price, the Rambler may seem steep for a 20 oz tumbler. However, YETI’s quality and performance make it a worthwhile investment for many.  
3. **No Handle** While the size is comfortable to hold, some users may miss having a built-in handle for added grip, especially when carrying hot beverages.  





# Who Is It For?

The YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler is perfect for:

* **Coffee Enthusiasts:** It keeps your coffee hot for hours and is easy to drink from on the go.
* **Outdoor Adventurers:** Whether camping, hiking, or fishing, it’s built to handle tough conditions.
* **Busy Commuters:** Its size and cup-holder compatibility make it a great companion for travel.
* **Eco-Conscious Shoppers:** Reusable and built to last, it’s a great way to reduce waste from disposable cups.





# Final Verdict

The **YETI Rambler 20 oz Tumbler** is an excellent choice for anyone seeking a reliable, stylish, and durable tumbler for daily use or outdoor adventures. While the price might be higher than other brands, the performance and quality more than justify the investment.

If you want a tumbler that keeps your drinks at the perfect temperature, looks great, and can handle a bit of wear and tear, the YETI Rambler is hard to beat.

Here’s a detailed look at its features, pros, and areas where it could improve to help you decide if it’s the right tumbler for you.

# First Impressions and Design

The BrüMate Era Tumbler is visually stunning, blending sleek aesthetics with a minimalist design. Available in a range of chic colors and finishes, it’s perfect for those who value style. The 40 oz capacity is a game-changer for people who want to stay hydrated throughout the day without constant refills. The contoured grip feels secure and comfortable, despite its larger size. It fits well in most cup holders—a crucial feature for commuters and road trippers.





# Key Features

1. **Triple-Insulated Technology** The BrüMate tumbler excels in temperature retention. It keeps drinks cold for up to 24 hours and hot for up to 12 hours, thanks to its triple-insulated stainless steel construction. Whether you’re sipping iced coffee on a hot summer day or enjoying hot tea in the winter, the tumbler delivers as promised.  
2. **Spill-Proof Lid** The BevLock lid with a magnetic closure is a standout feature. It’s leak-proof, so you can toss it in your bag without worrying about spills. The sliding lid design is intuitive and allows you to open and close it with one hand, which is super convenient.  
3. **Large Capacity Without the Bulk** Despite its 40 oz capacity, the tumbler feels surprisingly manageable. It’s not overly heavy, even when full, and the slim design makes it easier to handle than some bulkier alternatives.  
4. **Durability and Eco-Friendliness** Made from high-quality stainless steel, the BrüMate tumbler is built to last. It’s a sustainable alternative to single-use plastics, aligning with eco-conscious lifestyles.  





# What Stands Out

* **Versatility:** The Era tumbler works equally well for water, coffee, smoothies, or even cocktails. Its versatility makes it a favorite among busy professionals, fitness enthusiasts, and travelers.
* **Customizable Aesthetics:** With so many color options, it’s easy to find one that matches your personal style. From matte black to vibrant ombré shades, there’s something for everyone.
* **Comfortable Use:** The ergonomic handle and easy-to-clean lid make daily use a breeze. You won’t dread cleaning this tumbler at the end of the day.

# Areas for Improvement

1. **Price:** While the BrüMate Era is packed with features, it’s on the pricier side compared to generic tumblers. That said, the quality and performance justify the cost for many users.
2. **Lid Replacement:** Some users have reported that the magnetic BevLock lid needs careful cleaning to maintain functionality. While it’s durable, it’s not entirely immune to wear and tear.
3. **Weight:** While lighter than expected, the full 40 oz capacity can feel heavy for some, especially during extended use.





# Who Is It For?

The BrüMate Era 40 oz Tumbler is perfect for:

* **Busy Individuals:** Professionals, students, and anyone who wants a drink companion to keep up with their schedule.
* **Fitness Enthusiasts:** Its large capacity is great for staying hydrated during long workouts or outdoor activities.
* **Eco-Conscious Shoppers:** A durable, reusable option for those trying to reduce waste.





# Final Thoughts

The **BrüMate Era 40 oz Tumbler** is a fantastic investment for anyone looking for a high-performing, stylish tumbler. It’s versatile enough to meet the needs of a variety of lifestyles, whether you’re a coffee lover, a hydration advocate, or someone who values convenience and eco-friendliness.

If you’re okay with spending a little more for premium quality and aesthetics, the BrüMate tumbler is a top contender in the hydration game. With its excellent insulation, sleek design, and functional features, it’s worth every penny for those who prioritize form and function.

I recently purchased the **Stanley Quencher H2.0 Tumbler 30 oz**, and I can honestly say it’s one of the best hydration products I’ve ever used. Here’s a detailed review of what I love about this tumbler:

[Stanley Quencher H2.0 Tumbler ](https://preview.redd.it/dxidhyzqos2e1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=697da5171c3f59c9582874cc4cdd22c9468987e3)

# ✅Best Price➤➤ [**✅** https://amzn.to/3CBATiY](https://amzn.to/3CBATiY)



# Exceptional Insulation

The first thing that blew me away was the **insulation**. This tumbler keeps my drinks **cold for hours**. On hot summer days, I fill it with ice water in the morning, and by the time I’m sipping on it in the evening, there’s still ice floating around. It can easily keep ice cold for **24 hours** or more! The **double-wall vacuum insulation** also helps with hot drinks, though I mainly use it for cold beverages.

# Comfortable & Convenient Design

The **30 oz size** is perfect for staying hydrated throughout the day without constantly refilling. I can bring it to work, the gym, or just have it sitting next to me while I’m lounging at home. The tumbler has a **wide mouth** for easy filling and cleaning, and the **handle** is sturdy and comfortable for carrying around. It fits in most car cup holders, which is a huge bonus if you're always on the go like me!

The **spout lid** is another standout feature. It has a **straw** for easy sipping, and the **push-button lid** makes it easy to open and close with one hand. This is especially convenient when driving or multitasking. Plus, the straw is removable for easy cleaning!

# Durability and Build Quality

Stanley has always been known for its **high-quality products**, and the Quencher is no exception. Made from **stainless steel**, it feels solid and robust in hand. It has a **powder-coated finish** that gives it a sleek, matte appearance and helps it resist scratches. I've dropped it a couple of times (accidentally, of course!), and it hasn’t shown a single dent or mark.

# ✅Best Price➤➤ [**https://amzn.to/3CBATiY**](https://amzn.to/3CBATiY)



# Keeps Drinks Fresh

I love that the tumbler also helps keep my drinks **fresh**. Whether I’m drinking flavored water or iced coffee, the tumbler’s insulation keeps the taste intact without any weird metallic aftertaste. Plus, I don’t have to worry about condensation forming on the outside, which keeps my hands and bags dry.

# Eco-Friendly and Easy to Clean

The Stanley Quencher H2.0 is a great eco-friendly alternative to single-use plastic bottles. I use it daily and have found it’s easy to clean. The wide mouth makes it simple to wash, and I can even put it in the **dishwasher** (although I prefer hand-washing to preserve the finish).

# Sleek & Stylish

Let’s be honest—this tumbler is also **stylish**. I love the wide variety of colors, and it’s become a conversation starter among my friends. It’s chic yet functional, so I feel good about taking it everywhere.

# Cons

There’s very little to dislike about this tumbler. However, the **size** might be a bit large for those who prefer something more compact. If you’re looking for something smaller, Stanley offers other sizes, but for me, the **30 oz** is perfect. It might also be a bit heavier than other plastic tumblers, but the durability and insulation benefits make it totally worth it.

# Final Verdict

The **Stanley Quencher H2.0 Tumbler 30 oz** is an **amazing hydration companion** that’s built to last, keeps drinks cold or hot for hours, and looks great doing it. Whether you’re at work, the gym, or running errands, this tumbler is an absolute must-have for anyone who values convenience and hydration. I’ve been using it daily for a while now, and it’s become my go-to for staying hydrated. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and stylish tumbler!

I try not to compare myself and I even went to the point where I muted their account on twitter so that I wouldn’t have to see their posts and their replies to the engagement. 

The fact that I had to do that made me feel bad because I felt like I wasn’t coming into terms with my emotions so I tried again to check their account and just felt dread seeing all the praises that came their way.

For context, the other author writes more coffee shop/lighthearted aus while I, on the other hand, write heavier stories with more angst. I know a lot of people like reading fluff so I get that there would be more interaction in those genres and its getting really bad for me because sometimes I just think of writing in the same genre as them so I could get more interaction.


I crave for attention and it sucks lol I feel like its also because I have more free time now (I’m on a gap year) so I just spend most of my time just doomscrolling on social media.

**About Me:**
- 28 years old from NSW, Australia.
- 173cm tall with an average build with blue eyes and brown hair, currently in the process of growing it out.
- I’m as pale as they come—so much so that I might blind you in sunlight or turn into a tomato if exposed for too long.
- I work in tech/finance, but don’t worry, I’m not a finance bro.
- Happy to swap photos if that helps!

**Personality:**
- I’m pretty shy and anxious around new people, but once I warm up, I’m talkative and engaging.
- Introvert at heart, but I do enjoy going out with friends.
- I’m not religious and while I respect all beliefs, it might be tricky to connect with someone who is deeply religious.

**Hobbies:**
- Gaming is a big part of my life—mostly chill games, whether solo or with friends on Discord.
- Occasionally embarrass myself with a round of golf.
- Metalcore fan here! If you’re into Polaris / Thornhill / Sleep Token / etc let’s chat!
- I’ll stay up late to watch Verstappen race or mourn McLaren’s near-wins.

I’ve tried various dating apps without much luck and would prefer to connect with someone in Australia.

I’m looking for someone to make daily activities, like grabbing coffee or running errands, more enjoyable as well as enjoying common hobbies.

I've also kind of caught the travel bug so I'd absolutely love to have someone to travel and see either Australia or the world together.

I’m looking to connect with like-minded women who are kind, funny, talkative, and genuinely interested in building a real friendship.

A little about me:
I’m a 31-year-old Black Caribbean woman, born and raised in Baltimore, now living in the Austin area for work. I’ve been peacefully divorced for three years and have two amazing kids who keep me smiling.

In my free time, I love trying new things, whether it’s a new hobby or a cool spot in town. I enjoy watching documentaries and deep-dive think pieces on YouTube, skating, bowling, karaoke, tennis, hiking, fishing, working out, and even tinkering with my car. While I’m not a big gamer, I’m a fan of board games and puzzles. I’m also totally down to binge anime or discover a new show together!

Whether you’d like to be pen pals or meet up for coffee if you’re local, I’m excited to connect and start something meaningful.

#### 🤖 Chatbots: More Than Just Digital Helpers

Many of us see chatbots as our go-to for quick answers and efficiency boosters. They book our flights 🛫, manage our appointments 📅, and even recommend that quirky new series we never knew we needed! But, beyond these functions, chatbots have been silently absorbing lessons from their interactions. Here's a peek at the revelation journey.

---

#### 💬 Lesson #1: Humans Crave Personalized Interaction

What they've learned is monumental - we love personalization! Users get a kick out of feeling known and understood. Whether it's a tailored product suggestion or remembering our coffee preference (extra shot of espresso, anyone? ☕), chatbots enhance our experiences by being uniquely 'us-focused.'

**Tip:** If you want to make your chatbot experience more personal, engage fully in your interactions. The more details you share, the richer your interaction becomes.

---

#### 🌐 Lesson #2: Embracing Cultural Diversity

Chatbots have become cultural connoisseurs! 🌍 Through interacting with users around the globe, they grasp cultural nuances and are evolving to become more inclusive and sensitive in their responses. From holiday greetings to understanding context from different time zones, AI is bridging cultural divides.

**Tip:** Explore how different cultures interact with technology. Not only will this expand your knowledge, but it'll also improve the way you interact with tech in diverse contexts!

---

#### 🧠 Lesson #3: The Power of Emotions in Conversations

Initially, chatbots were all about data crunching and fact-finding. Now, they're mastering emotional intelligence - understanding tone, detecting sentiment, and responding in a way that feels reassuring and human. Isn't it amazing when your virtual assistant knows you're stressed and offers to lighten your load? 😇

**Tip:** When chatting with bots, use emojis and express your emotions clearly. You might be surprised at how well they understand and adapt!

There does not appear to be any official plugin for opening InVision prototypes in other design tools like Figma. I wanted to find a solution, so I wrote an application called Studio Keys, which converts the prototypes (saved under the “.studio” file extension) into scalable SVGs. 

In other words, you can recover your old work and reuse it on other tools like Figma, Sketch, or any prototyping tool that handles SVGs!\*. At the very least, you’ll be able to view the mockups and keep them for portfolio reasons.

You can access the application here: [https://studio-keys.onrender.com/](https://studio-keys.onrender.com/)

To use it, upload your .studio file and the application will output a .zip folder that contains one SVG for each ""page"" in the artboard. I strongly encourage you to check out the [git repo](https://github.com/aviomg/studio-keys) if you want to know more.

I made this application free and open-source because I really do want to try and help people. However, it is my own handiwork, and quite a bit of it, so I would appreciate being credited and ask that you do not repackage or steal the program :). 

If you find my application useful and want to spread the word, leave feedback through the google form linked on the site (via the button labeled “contribute to this project”), or optionally “buy me a coffee” (also linked on the website), it would be much, much appreciated :). Feedback would be especially excellent as this is the first time I've ever done something like this.

Disclaimer: I own this website and am not affiliated with InVision in any way. Also, I’m not a business or anything I’m a college comp sci student and this was just a fun personal project.

\*Note: I am not a UX designer so the only tool that I made a free trial account with to actually confirm that it can open these SVGs and identify all the elements of the mockup is Figma; someone else can verify regarding other platforms

TLDR: if you ever made prototypes/designs with InVision Studio, and you now have them saved to your device/drive as a “.studio” file which you cannot open, and you wish you could, then this tool is for you!",1,1732429584.0,u_avi-omg,0,1.0,False

I've been wanting to share my living room setup and get some ideas from you all about furniture arrangements. After recently renovating my space, I've learned quite a bit about creating a cozy and functional living area.

The centerpiece of my living room is this amazing sectional sofa I got recently (check it out here: https://athometouch.com/sofa). It's super comfortable and has completely transformed how I use the space. Before this, I had an old loveseat that barely fit two people, but now I can actually host movie nights with friends without anyone sitting on the floor!

Besides the sofa, I've got two accent chairs positioned at an angle, creating this nice conversation area. I used to think armchairs were just for grandparents, but man, was I wrong! They're perfect for when I want to curl up with a book or when guests come over.

The coffee table I chose is this modern wooden piece with storage underneath - absolute game-changer for hiding all my random stuff. I've also added some side tables because, let's be honest, we all need somewhere to put our drinks and snacks.

What really ties everything together is my area rug. It's got these subtle patterns that match both my couch (which you can find here: https://athometouch.com/sofa) and the overall color scheme of the room. Plus, it makes the space feel way more put together.

I've noticed that having the right furniture setup makes such a huge difference in how much I actually use my living room. It's become my favorite spot to relax, work from home, or just hang out with friends.

What about you guys? What's your living room setup like? I'm always looking for new ideas to improve my space, and I'd love to hear what works for you!

Also, if anyone's struggling with their living room layout or looking for new furniture, I'd be happy to share more specific details about what worked for me. It took me ages to figure out the right arrangement, but now I finally feel like I've got it just right.",1,1732429447.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

# 1. Create opportunities for informal interaction. 

One of the main challenges of working virtually is the lack of casual conversations. that occur naturally in the office these moments Whether talking, drinking coffee or laughing in the hall. It plays an important role in building relationships. Virtual offices can simulate these moments by scheduling informal meetings, like virtual coffee breaks or “happy hours.” Platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams also allow teams to share memes, hobbies, and social media. or photos of pets to create a non-work channel.

# 2. Prioritize regular video check-ins. 

seeing your face even on the screen Can reduce feelings of loneliness Scheduling regular video check-ins with team members not only helps keep managers up to date, but also helps keep them informed. But it is also a space for employees to share their feelings. This is especially useful for people who struggle with loneliness or stress. However, it is important to strike a balance. Avoid back-to-back video calls, which can lead to fatigue. and opt for shorter, meaningful interactions instead.

# 3. Create a culture of empathy and support. 

A supportive workplace culture goes a long way in improving mental health. Leaders should foster empathy by encouraging open communication about mental well-being. Companies can also provide resources, such as access to mental health professionals or mindfulness apps. Managers can lead by example. Share your experiences with the challenges of working remotely. and show weaknesses This creates a safe environment for employees to express their feelings without fear of judgment.

# 4. Promote teamwork and bonding.

 Working in silos can make employees feel disconnected from the team's purpose. to fight this Businesses should focus on promoting cooperation. Virtual tools like Trello, Asana, and Miro help teams collaborate on projects in real time. Promotes interaction and teamwork Additionally, virtual team building activities such as quizzes and online escape classes will be held. or cooperative games It can help build friendships and reduce feelings of loneliness.

# 5. Promote work-life balance

 One of the reasons for silence Another contributor to loneliness and poor mental health in virtual office spaces is the blurring of boundaries between work and personal life. Employees often struggle to ""switch off,"" which leads to burnout and a lack of personal fulfillment. Organizations should encourage employees to set limits, such as set hours and regular breaks. Using tools like block calendars or focus timers can help employees maintain a healthy balance. This will ultimately improve their overall mental health.

# 6. Recognize and celebrate success.

 Recognizing employee contributions promotes a sense of belonging and appreciation. Virtual office space can also include regular mentions, awards, or celebratory emails to highlight individual and team achievements. Celebration, whether it be a virtual birthday party Anniversary of important events or project completion It can bring a human touch to remote work. and help employees feel valued

# 7. Invest in virtual office technology 

Virtual office platforms such as Gather, WorkHub, and Sococo create immersive digital environments that mimic a physical office. These platforms allow team members to see who is online and “go” to the virtual meeting room. and converse naturally Just like in a real office This technology promotes a sense of presence and community. and reduce feelings of loneliness

# Conclusion

Loneliness in a virtual office space is a challenge. But it couldn't pass. By promoting informal interaction Promote empathy Promote collaboration And by investing in the right tools, businesses can create a supportive environment where employees feel connected and valued. A thriving virtual workspace isn't just about productivity. But it's also about making sure everyone's mental health and happiness are a priority.",1,1732429389.0,u_heileyoffices,0,1.0,False

Me: I’ll be there Thursday- Sunday. Tell dad you don’t want to go so we can hang out! 
Him: I already told him I want to go I can’t cancel and I won’t be back until Monday. 
Me: Oh okay, You can tell him, you just don’t want to. *Laughs*
Him: You’re right 
Me: Alright 
Him: Just because you don’t get along with dad doesn’t mean I don’t have to either.
Me: …. (Silent and confused)
Him: You’re probably beefing with him and his wife and our little brother. You can’t even be around for an hour without getting upset. 
Me: I’m not beefing with anyone??? 
Him: You can’t control your emotions. 
Me: Ok… 
Him: When did you say you were coming again? 
Me: Why? You just said you weren’t gonna be there?
Him: What are you mad for? 
Me: I’m not… you just said you’re going with dad? I’ll be there Thursday- Sunday
Him: Oh yeah I’ll be gone. 
Me: Okay bye. 

(For context I don’t really get along well with either of my parents. I’m the only girl and I used to get mistreated often, to them I’m dramatic, sensitive or overreacting but I experience it differently because I don’t allow anyone to treat me badly anymore. I’m usually the only one who will call them out for being unfair or just wrong in general. Hence why I don’t go home, or speak to either one of my parents at all really. Lots of things have happened that my little brother has no idea about but tbh it’s really none of his business. I’m sure both of my parents have made comments about me to him which is why he said these things. However, I want to mention that I have NEVER said to not have a relationship with our father despite all the things my father has done) 

(This is the situation my brother is referring to) In the summer of 2023 I went to my dads house and our baby brother (5, has a different mom) spilled fruit punch all over the coffee table and carpet. (he is horribly behaved and has no discipline) and I told him to clean it up. He said no. I went upstairs and his grandma said no he’s NOT gonna clean it up. I told her he needs to clean it up bc he spilled it she said no. We exchange words, I wasn’t disrespectful I just simply told her repeatedly if he makes a mess he needs to clean it up, that’s how children learn. This situation completely blew up and I, once again was made to be the one in the WRONG!!!!! 
I was gathering my things and getting ready to leave and go to my apartment because it’s always drama at my father’s house because of his misbehaved child and my little brother (17) asked if he could come with. I agreed to let him come with and I agreed to take him all the way back (2hours away from my apartment) to my mother’s house, even though that’s my fathers job as part of their custody agreement. My father made the comment that my brother (17) was the only person being considerate in the situation. Alright I guess. 

ANYWAYS I think my brother’s comments were completely wrong. I don’t think I deserved that from him at all. I was just calling simply because I wanted to spend time with him. He took the conversation really downhill, for no reason. I don’t know where to go from here. He’s old enough to know right from wrong, and this might be how he sees me as a person. However there’s a part of me that thinks he’s only repeating things he’s heard from other people. This conversation has me really reconsidering #1 our relationship, and #2 going anywhere for thanksgiving because this is the kind of stuff I deal with all the time. I’m genuinely over it. I tried to self reflect and thought maybe I was in the wrong for telling him to stay at home, but I was just joking around. I don’t know AIO???

It’s like my entire body has changed. I have a 5.8 A1C so I am on top of my diabetes. It was a 5.3 before this…

I was on afrezza and tresiba and it worked well except for severe lows and problems with dosing it, and I was/am considering pregnancy so I switched. Highs came down really fast which was great (unless it caused a severe low). So I went to tandem with humulog and holy shit humulog does NOT work for me at all despite a high basal rate and correction factor. I had eggs and a sausage and coffee (bloused a little for the coffee because it makes my sugars rise) yet my sugar was in the 180s and wouldn’t come down for hours. It’s like I’m not absorbing it. I had ketones and projectile vomitted due to 3 failed Autosoft sites. I am on my last trusteel sample and even trusteel doesn’t work that well absorption wise (or it’s the insulin).

 This has been such a hard adjustment and I’m worried about complications due to elevated sugars which as mentioned do not come down as fast as afrezza. I’m not even feeling my lows anymore (?!) which I’m super sensitive to usually, but it started when I started the pump.

Has anyone had similar experiences? (2) (1) Would Lyumjev or Novolog be better?",4,1732428878.0,Type1Diabetes,6,0.84,False
