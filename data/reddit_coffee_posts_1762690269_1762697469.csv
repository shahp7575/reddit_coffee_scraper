1osk8og,https://i.redd.it/yiby1caqn80g1.jpeg,Help me tweak my process please!,"Right. I've got a simple 1-gallon still, pictured here. I knew when I bought it that it would never give me industrial levels of outputz but it's within my budget, solid copper, and I enjoy using it.

Anyway, my basic recipe is as follows:

•5lb cracked corn
•4lbs sugar
•1tsp amylase
•1tbsp Red Star DADY

I grind my corn using a food processor until it's the consistency of very rough sand or fine gravel. I then heat it on the stove in about 2 gallons of water until it becomes extremely thick and soupy. I let it sit for a few hours to cool to 150°F, where I then add my enzymes.

The enzymes work for another hour, in an insulated container to maintain the correct temperature. Finally, I stir in my sugar, and add the whole thing to a 5-gallon carboy, topping with cool water and giving it a good shake. I then place a coffee filter over the top, and let it sit in a dark room at around 70°. Most sources say to leave it for two weeks, but I find my mash doesn't really stop bubbling for about a month.

I then fill my little pot still, leaving about 2 inches of room to avoid puking, and crank my hot plate up to high.  

Out of a one-gallon run, I only get about a pint of ~60% liquor before I run into the cloudy stuff. Can anyone help me tweak my process to dial up the output? I'd appreciate it if you all have any tips, or if there's something glaringly wrong with my process that you notice. Thanks a ton!",1,1762697186.0,firewater,0,1.0,False
1osk8je,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1osk8je/my_19f_ldr_girlfriend_18f_and_our_friend_18m_are/,My (19F) ldr girlfriend (18F) and our friend (18M) are meeting each other without me.,"Hello!

So I’ve been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for 3 months now. We both make art and were introduced to a friend group on discord around the same time and starting dating a few months later. We live very far away from each other, far enough that plane tickets are on the pricier side (and since I’m only 19, cross country trips are a bit of a chore to plan). There was someone else in this discord server (I’ll call him Josh) that we made really good friends with early on. At some point we learned that he lived in the same state as my girlfriend, a couple hours away, which was awesome! They talked a couple times about meeting up, but it was in passing and never really plausible. 

Currently, there are plans for me to visit my girlfriend in a few weeks and meet in person for the first time. I’m extremely excited, as I’ll be there for a week and we have tons of plans. Since Josh would be on a break from school and therefore closer to home, one of our plans was to meet him in person as well and all hang out! The plane ticket is bought and this plan has been in place for a couple months. I’ve never been in a long distance relationship before, nor have an ever kept a long distance friend that I met online for this long. To be honest, when this all started I was extremely hesitant towards the idea of dating someone I’d met online. It’s not super my style, but I really liked this girl and I’m under the belief that you shouldn’t bypass opportunities just because they’re unfamiliar territory. All that to say, this is new to me, and there are a couple situations I don’t really know how to handle.

Here’s the current situation: My girlfriend has really really really wanted coffee from a specific coffee shop recently. Like she’s been aggressively craving it. She doesn’t have a car, and so she hasn’t had the time outside of using public transportation for work and school to go get some. I think the soonest she’d be able to get some is Tuesday (I promise this is relevant).  Josh told us this week that he was in town for a wedding and would be about an hour away from my girlfriend for the whole weekend. My girlfriend joked that she really wanted coffee and that he should come get her and they’d go together. Now there are plans for Josh to come down and get coffee with her today. For some reason, this has really got me down. None of us have ever met each other, and I was really excited to meet my girlfriend, and then for us to meet Josh in a couple weeks. I know them seeing each other doesn’t detract from that, but for some reason it feels like it does. It’s just really been making me sad that they’re going to meet each other without me, instead of waiting a couple weeks for when I’ll actually be in town visiting. It makes me feel kind of forgotten. I know neither of them would want me to feel that way. I haven’t said anything because I don’t think I should. I want to be communicative, but I don’t want to ruin their experience of meeting each other. It just makes me feel so bad.

I’m on the younger side and this whole ldr thing is new to me, so I’m having a hard time sorting my emotions. I can’t tell if I’m just being overly emotional about something that isn’t a big deal. I don’t think I should express my feelings about this, but is that the right choice?

Thank you very much for any advice or insight :)

1osk8ab,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1osk8ab/breakfast_vouchers_who_is_right_aita/,Breakfast Vouchers. Who is right? AITA?,"Staying at a full service without a lounge, was given breakfast vouchers for their restaurant. 

Get to restaurant the next morning, small paper sign where you order that says “Platinum and above: If using breakfast vouchers, you may only order drip coffee”

This seems like a weird hill to die on. I ask politely if i could do cold brew instead. I am told no. So i ask for drip coffee, in a cold brew cup, filled with ice. They obliged. 

The next day, i try to get the same thing, I’m told the F&B manager has now heard about me and vetoed my iced coffee hack too. 

I’m here for two weeks so i politely explain that I’m entitled to breakfast with the voucher, which i am not actually ordering. Coffee only. So if this is a food cost thing, i could understand, cold brew MAYBE costs them a few pennies more per serving…but the food i could be ordering and am not ordering would cost far more than giving me ice and a larger cup to put my drip coffee in. 

They still refuse. 

At this point i take my hot drip coffee and politely say, you are citing the F&B managers policy as reasoning, may i take my case up with them when he or she is available? No. Apparently i can’t. Now a line is forming so i move on. 

Am i just an entitled prick or does this seem like a weird hill to die on for the hotel? Especially on such a trivial food cost difference and given the context of the “guest experience” … and apparently I’m not allowed to talk to the F&B manager either.

Some people switch jobs every year hoping to stumble into the “right” one. Others stay frozen in the same role for too long, afraid to ask for more. And then there’s the hustle culture squad, trying to build a personal brand out of burnout. 

Most of us were never taught how to actually plan a career, let alone set professional goals that are meaningful and achievable. The worst part? Platforms like TikTok and Instagram are full of ""career advice"" from unqualified creators chasing clicks over credibility. It’s easy to feel like you’re failing when the algorithm idolizes 22-year-old CEOs and productivity cults.

So, here’s a guide pulled from sources that actually know what they’re talking about: academic research, management psychology, top podcasts, and career coaching programs used by Fortune 500 companies. This is for anyone who wants to take their career seriously without losing their mind. It’s not about fake confidence. It’s about building real clarity, skills, and momentum.

 Start with a personal inventory, not a 5-year plan

   Most people think career planning means making a rigid roadmap. But Harvard Business Review reports that the best long-term performers build careers through strategic pivots, not fixed paths.

   Use Bill Burnett and Dave Evans’ Designing Your Life method:

     Odyssey Planning: Write out three different versions of your life five years from now. One based on continuing your current path, one if you made a big switch, and one if money weren’t an object. It frees your brain from tunnel vision.

     Ask: What would you do if you weren’t afraid of failing? This uncovers hidden interests that could become real goals.

 Set your goals based on prototypes, not guesses

   Don’t just say “I want to be a manager” or “I want to work in tech.” Those are vague and usually based on assumptions.

   Stanford’s career coach Kathy Davies suggests using prototyping interviews: talk to people already in the role you think you want. Ask:

     What does a day in your job actually look like?

     What surprised you most about this work?

     What skills are essential, and how did you get them?

   Research from the MIT Sloan Management Review found that people who do informational interviews are 2x more likely to make successful career moves, because they base decisions on lived data, not fantasy.

 Use SMART goals, but with a focus on systems  

   Everyone knows the SMART acronym Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound. But the real value isn’t in the goal, it’s in the system you create to hit it.

   James Clear’s Atomic Habits explains it best: “You don't rise to the level of your goals; you fall to the level of your systems.”

     Example: Want to become a senior designer in 2 years? Your system might include weekly portfolio reviews, monthly design critiques with a mentor, and a quarterly new skill challenge.

     Track progress weekly, not yearly. Quarterly review cycles work best – they match how most companies plan anyway.

 Your network is 70% of your opportunities  build it now, before you need it

   A survey by LinkedIn shows that 70% of professionals were hired at a company where they had a connection.

   Don’t wait until you’re desperate. Set a goal of one new coffee chat per week. Reach out to former coworkers, alumni, people in roles you admire.

   Use “curiosity networking”  ask how they got there, what they learned, and what they wish they knew earlier. People love sharing their journey if you’re not trying to sell or beg.

   Keep a simple spreadsheet. Track who you’ve met, what you learned, and when to follow up again.

 Skill stacking beats specialization in uncertain industries

   When job markets shift fast, being “the best” at one thing is risky. What works better is skill stacking  having 2–3 complementary competencies.

   Scott Adams (creator of Dilbert but also a Stanford-trained analyst) coined this idea: You don’t need to be #1 in the world at one thing. Be top 25% at a few, and the combo becomes rare.

     Example: A digital marketer with design skills and data analytics knowledge is way more valuable than one with only SEO experience.

   Coursera’s 2023 Skills Report says the top skill combos employers now look for include:

     Communication + data visualization

     Domain expertise + Python or SQL

     Writing + AI prompt engineering

 Promotions are rarely automatic, even if you’re good at your job

   Research by Gallup shows that only 18% of managers were promoted based on actual management skills. Most got there by default or seniority, not excellence.

   Don’t assume “doing great work” is enough. Learn how to manage up:

     Regularly align your work with business goals. Speak in terms of impact, not effort.

     Ask your manager once per quarter, “What would it take for me to be considered for the next level?”

     Keep your receipts. Maintain a running doc of wins, metrics, and feedback. This becomes your promo packet.

 Take your career temperature every 90 days

   Career coach Jenny Blake (former Google talent developer) recommends creating a “Career Clarity Dashboard.” Every 3 months, ask:

     What activities give me energy? Which drain me?

     Am I growing or coasting?

     What opportunities am I noticing lately?

   This helps you spot burnout before it hits and allows you to course correct early.

 Don’t ignore reputation capital

   Your brand is what people say about you when you’re not in the room. Not in a fake LinkedIn influencer way. In the how reliable, valuable, and easy to work with you are.

   Harvard's Project Implicit research revealed that people make competency judgments in under 100 milliseconds. It’s unfair, but reality.

     Show up consistently, take initiative, share credit. That builds trust.

     When in doubt, be useful. Not flashy. The “reliable helper” gets pulled into opportunities long before the loud ones do.

All of this takes time. But it works way better than hoping luck or hustle will deliver your dream job. Good careers aren’t found. They’re built  slowly, intentionally, and with a lot of testing. ",1,1762696897.0,LockedInMan,0,1.0,False

There is a ""total dissolved solids"" meter in the faucet, and it hovers between 4 and 8 TDS (supposedly very clean but I haven't had the water lab-tested).

With his trusty cup of sea salt coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' and ‘wholesome’ dates (whatever that means).

You either get guys who sends nsfw stuff right away or you get a friendly ones so I thought it’d be fun to write it in a mock format just like a resume! LOL

##About me

An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into small business and investments, 2nd year law student (took a LOA atm), can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck lol (/s towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex-cheating issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no jowa (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha). Last relationship (6 years) was 3 years ago and dated someone last year but didn’t worked out.

- I'm 5'9"", physically fit and active, resides in QC. I would say that average level attractive yet clean and very hygienic

- I'm an INTJ-T Arch, Aries, if you’re into MBTI and believes in that people only have 12 personalities.

- Loves to read history, finance and self-help books not because I’m smart rich but I believe about continous learning and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as really awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set long-term feasible goals and actively pursue them.

##Here's a list of my favorites:
Movies/Series | Music | Places | Activities | Books
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|--:
Godfather | Radiohead | Paris | Cycling | The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday
Sherlock | Eraserheads | Coffee Shops | Painting | How to Win Friends & Influence People
Castaway | Nirvana  | Cebu | Muay Thai | Meditation s by Marcus Aurelius
Forrest Gump | Ebe Dancel | Japan | Scuba/Freediving | Start with Why by Simon Sinek

##Pros:

- Respoņsible (Good credit score, no debts, no criminal records, and self-reliant)

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

- Respects your views and accept healthy criticism. Respects personal space and time

- Actually appreciating the things you'll do for me, and showing it. If you cooked a big dinner, saying thank you is nice. Doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen is even nicer, and in my opinion, should be the norm. The cook doesn't clean. If someone does something for me, I'll show them that their effort was appreciated instead of just accepting their generosity and then running off back to whatever I'm doing.

- Accepts respònsibility or has accountability for one's own action and does not try to blame everything or everyone else. 

- No addiction/s, drugs, tattoos and not into online games

##My preference:

- Someone who has a strong passion for accurate and comprehensive learning, maintains a normal BMI, physically active and is beautiful and easy on the eyes - I believe that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes (no offense intended towards plus-size women!).

- High standards for what she wants and is not afraid to communicate it.

- Craves knowledge too. Love and isn't afraid to try new things

- Passionate and proud about something they've been working on/have done/are planning to do

- Confident about what they want but isn't in-your-face about it.

—and ideally, someone who enjoys staying active too, so we can share more than just deep conversations—maybe runs, hikes, or muay thai sessions together. Shared passions make connections even stronger.

Let's take a break from stressing over the mundane and focus on the important stuff - like what will make us happy for the rest of our lives! Share your thoughtys on how we can achieve that and let's get this happiness train moving! Send me your pic and I'll send mine!

**Edit**

Note: I’m reposting this since I haven’t found the right person yet. This will be my last attempt—if it doesn’t work out, maybe online dating just isn’t for me. Still, I’ve met some good people along the way: some weren’t ready for anything serious, and with others, the connection just didn’t click. I’d like to reiterate that I’m looking for someone who’s physically active, not obese, and who doesn’t do drugs or have tattoos.

It was supposed to be a routine test.

Skippy—officially designated Strategic Knowledge Interface and Predictive Processing Yield—had designed a new subspace-jump algorithm. According to his own projections (which, to be fair, were never wrong unless he wanted them to be), the algorithm should have increased FTL efficiency by 8.4%. Nothing extravagant. Just enough to shave hours off long hauls.

Instead, it tore open a rift into a universe where optimism went to die.

Aboard the Flying Dutchman, the bridge crew had just finished lunch. Joe Bishop had been mid-sip of his coffee when it happened: a flicker of violet static, a burst of magnetic pressure, and suddenly—he was staring at a wall of black armor.

The lights dimmed. The air crackled with ozone.

Then it spoke.

“HERETICS.”

The voice was deep. Metallic. Ancient. Not the sort of “ancient” that meant “from the archives,” but ancient in the sense of something dragged from a dying god’s last breath. A sword hissed to life, crackling with energy. A bolt pistol the size of a small torpedo was already rising in its owner’s grip.

Joe opened his mouth.

“Skippy—”
“Already on it,” Skippy cut in.

There was a brief shimmer of energy, followed by a faint mechanical snap! The figure froze mid-swing. Literally.

The man—if it was a man—stood over seven feet tall, encased in thick ceramite plate the color of dead stars. Wax seals and purity parchments fluttered from his armor. Across his chest, an iron cross was inlaid with aged gold. His eyes were twin burning red lenses. The moment he had appeared, he’d moved with the speed of an apex predator.

Now, locked in place, he radiated silent fury like a reactor leak.

Joe exhaled slowly and turned to Skippy’s nearest terminal. “What... did you do?”

Skippy sounded vaguely sheepish. “Well, Joe, I was implementing Subspace Mode Variant 7.3. It was supposed to reduce temporal slipstream drift. But instead of cleaner jump signatures, we, uh... may have cracked a hole into another reality.”

“May have?”

“Fine. Did.”

Another crewmember, Halvorson, blinked up at the armored figure. “Is he—uh—is he human?”

“Technically,” Skippy replied. “He’s enhanced, heavily. Think... military-grade human 5.0. Extra organs. He’s wearing powered plate with integral shielding. Based on the armor’s internal readouts, he calls himself a ‘Black Templar Captain.’ Whatever that means.”

The figure’s vox grille growled back to life.

“You dare bind the Emperor’s wrath? I will see your blasphemy scoured from existence.”

Joe held up both hands. “Okay, okay. Let’s all just take a breath—”

“YOUR AIR IS TAINTED.”

“Right. Good talk.”

Skippy cleared his throat digitally. “Just to clarify: in his universe, machine intelligences like me are classified as heretical abominations. And ships like ours? Yeah. Might as well be floating cult temples. I recommend we don’t antagonize him further.”

“We didn’t even antagonize him to begin with,” Halvorson muttered.

The Templar’s gauntlet gave a slow, pained creak as one finger began to flex.

Joe backed away another step. “How long can you keep him frozen like this?”

Skippy paused.

“Well, his armor’s internal failsafes are resisting my overrides. Best-case? Twenty-eight hours.”

Joe narrowed his eyes. “And worst-case?”

Another pause. “...Nine minutes.”

Groans erupted around the bridge.

“You are not beyond judgment,” the Templar hissed. “You are judgment delayed.”

My HR contact cheerfully said, “Just give OSC a call — they’ll walk you through it.”

Ha. Famous last words.

I’ve now been trying to reach someone at OSC for days. The hold music has become the soundtrack of my life. I’ve memorized every note, every pause — it’s like the auditory version of a DMV line that never moves.

At this point, I’m convinced OSC’s phone system is powered by a hamster on a wheel who occasionally takes a coffee break. I’ve gone through all five stages of grief waiting on hold — denial (“maybe it’s just lunch hour”), anger (“why am I still listening to Kenny G?”), bargaining (“I’ll trade my entire pension for a human voice”), depression (“I live here now”), and finally, acceptance (“this is just who I am — a person on hold”).

The automated message keeps saying, “Your call is very important to us.” Meanwhile, my beard has grown three inches, and I think my phone battery aged ten years.

All I wanted was a simple answer about enrollment. Now, I’m questioning my life choices, my retirement plan, and whether anyone has ever successfully spoken to a live human being at OSC.

Stopped into a local Venture X in Boca Raton and was very pleased with the vibe and atmosphere. Indoor and outdoor workspaces, meeting rooms both small and large, podcast room, rentable work offices as well as a kitchen with snacks and coffee throughout the day.
I worked throughout the day using my 1 Day Free Pass and had a good experience overall. I move around a few times to find my zen spot where I could get work done and focus. I ended up in a space next to a large window overlooking downtown Boca Raton. Kind of felt like my own office. 
I managed to get a lot more done than I normally would at some random place I normally find myself going to. 
The only downside I could point out was being able to conduct phone calls with clients. My job does require quite a bit of conversing as I am in sales. 
I’m also very conscious of those working around me and don’t want to be ‘that guy’ who thinks the place is MY Office like a few people who walk around on the phone here like they run the joint. 
There were also a few chatty women who decided to start openly discussing their life while I was working. I wish management would tell people when they come here to use their indoor voice like elementary schoolers. I guess some people just don’t get it!
In any event I’m about to pay the $200/mo as this seems more than fair for a nice, clean workplace. 
I did happen to check out another one on Federal near Yamato and didn’t get the same feeling or vibe as Venture X. Plus it was about $100 more per month.

Here’s what most of us never ever see  : Every year, workplace stress quietly claims 156,000 lives. That’s not global—that’s just India, Europe, and the US. Just Three Regions . Imagine : fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, friends—faces from our own memories—worn down by pressuress you never find in a job description.

We talk about “burnout” as if a vacation can fix it. But the truth? Families break. People break. No one puts this in a spreadsheet. The struggle is silent, but the cost can now be felt.

This crisis drains more than energy—it steals dreams, tears up paychecks, ennds stories far too soon. The wave is bigger than we admit. And those 156,000? They’re the ones we actually count. If we knew the full number, it would shake the floor beneath us.

Here’s what matters: This isn’t just about pushing through. It’s about survival—and it’s time we treatedd it that way. Every check-in, every honest conversation, every policy that cares, has the power to save a story from ending too soon.

If you or someone you know is struggling, let’s talk. Drop a comment, start a conversation, reach out. This is one crisis we can fight—together.

1osju6c,https://i.redd.it/9jkqtizgg80g1.png,One Night Stand Stopped Me Having Second Child,"Hey everyone! 😁  
  
I made an interesting discovery when trying to get all the Achievements finished recently, and I wanted to share to see if it helps others save some time/pain too.   
  
This discovery was concerning issues having the second child needed for the **'Full House'** Achievement. 

After literally months of in game time, broodily (but patiently) waiting for Abigail to want to have another baby, I started to suspect something might be wrong.   
  
As a responsible grown up, I got my Farmer checked out by Harvey, who reassured me everything was fine 'down there', and Abigail was all good too (he said she should cut back on the Amethyst crunching, she just laughed...) so it wasn't anything 'mechanical', so we just kept trying...   
  
Then, I was struck by inspiration one night - when I couldn't get into my own bed because I'd moved some furniture around in the morning, and I passed out because I'd stayed in the Caves just that wee bit too long and didn't have time to move the dresser when I was rushing back...   
  
As unconsciousness gripped me and I felt the world getting dark, I pondered... *""I have the second bed ready in the room... But do the kids in Stardew need to be able to get into* ***their*** *beds in the same way my Farmer does, in order to let the game know there is a second bed available for another child...?""* 🤔 

Cue a late wakeup, a few cups of coffee, and then a quick redecoration - Literally moving a couple of items around in the kids room (see image) to free up the sides of the children's beds. 

Sure enough, it seemed like only a few days later Abi was delighted to announce we were going to have that second crotch goblin soon, and the Achievement would be mine! 

So, yeah - that's how one night stand prevented me from having a second child... 

Why... What did you think this was about? 😉

1osjtsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1osjtsr/am_i_the_asshole_for_not_wanting_to_date_single/,Am I the asshole for not wanting to date single moms?,"I 36m have been on and off the dating apps for many years. And every time I’m swiping if I see somebody, that’s been there for a really long time I don’t swipe on them. Same thing with girls that seem to aggressively hate guys. Or any girl that has anything referencing she has a type. It just screams red flags to me. A slightly newer addition to my not swiping list is single moms. And there’s nothing wrong with single moms. I know that it’s very hard to raise kids. My mom and dad raised six of them both their own and adopted like myself. But at least where I am the dating apps are flooded with single moms. And it makes me not even want to be on the apps at all.

Time and time again I’ve tried to give it a chance. But it is always chaos. Can they find a sitter can they make time to get some face to face time for even 30 minutes to get coffee and see if there’s anything sparking. And some of these girls have wasted weeks or months of my time trying to get a date going. That’s not the only problem though they seem to just want texting buddies and I feel that they should just have an AI app that allows them to just have a texting buddy where they’re not interfering with other people’s lives.

The biggest red flag about them is that apparently every single one of them dated a narcissist. Which after the big me two movement every time I hear anything like that I am highly suspect. Hate me or not but I do not believe all women. And I’ve met a lot of dads that have removed themselves from the situation. Some of them being old classmates of mine and people that I have had a friendship with in the past and then drifted away and then we met years later. And I would say all, but one of these guys are extremely awesome dudes. Not a mean bone in their bodies and they do well for themselves.

I seem to hear a lot of the same stories about how the woman of the relationship made living with them unbearable. Everything from setting insane double standards, no accountability, cheating, bullying, physical abuse, child neglect, child abuse, drug problems both over the counter and street drugs, and almost every single one of them has reported that they have an extreme drinking problem and receipts to match (videos, pictures, texts, audio recordings)

Knowing this, I have tried to give single moms a chance. But as of last month I put my foot down. I tried to give the single mom a chance because it looks like she is doing the best that she can. She travels almost 2 hours a day for work and she takes care of people for work. She’s not in the best shape, but she says that she’s trying to get better.. but honestly, our date was horrendous and when it came time to bring her back to my apartment so that she could get to her car or come upstairs I politely told her that she should drive safe.

It took about three weeks to set up a date. When the day finally did come, she arrived and she was a lot heavier than her photos. And I’m not talking like 4 pounds. I’m talking like 40. And since I had already warmed up the car and picked a place I decided to just go through with it because she’s already driven an hour and 20 minutes to get to my apartment. The restaurant that that I chose ended up having an hour long wait so we decided to just go to the nearest place that had food. I didn’t know that there were some weird spinoff bar restaurant that only served gluten-free vegan weird shit that had me in an instant state of regret. But before we even got to look at those menus, she goes to the bar and promptly orders a drink pounds half the drink before we even start talking. And then while looking over the menu, realizing that nothing there was very good. She has already consumed the whole drink. This is about two minutes in to sitting.

Fast forward about five minutes of trying to justify anything on the menu. I decide to look online for other places that are open that have food that I will eat. We decide on a place that’s about 10 minutes out from the downtown area with less of a chance of being packed. We get there and she instantly orders yet another drink. And by the way, I am over 10 years sober and she knows this. We start to have basic chitchat, but somehow it turns into her giving me sob stories about her ex and how crazy and abusive he was. I ask her other things about herself, but she asks absolutely nothing about me.

The food finally arrives and I think I had some wings and fries because I wasn’t overly hungry and also wanted to be a little bit budget friendly because she has now ordered a handful of drinks and I have a feeling that I’m going to have to pay for the whole meal as well as having to cover the drink that she had at the first place. With that said she orders throughout the night on additional two more drinks. And at this point, she is at the stage where she keeps on telling the same short story over and over while trying to shovel food into her mouth.

I am already repulsed, very much regretting ever setting the state up in the first place. But sure enough the bill comes (112$). I put my card up because when the bill comes, she doesn’t even say anything about splitting the bill or how we’re going to split it up or at bare minimum I cover the bill and she gives the tip. Which is really shitty, but still minorly acceptable.

We get in the car and there’s more talking, but honestly, I’ve blurred it all out. Because it was all about her and her life and her life/work drama/gossip. We finally pulled into my driveway and I am completely over it. Under normal circumstances, if the girl had had some drinks for dinner, I would suggest that we watch a movie or play some board games or something for her to sober up and then we can make the decision whether or not we want to get intimate or not. But any chance of that is completely out the window so I bid her a farewell and get on with my own night.

I don’t think I’ve ever blocked a number that fast. I blocked her number. I blocked and reported her on the dating app. I then added to my dating profile “not interested in dating single moms”. And then within a couple of days I had at least 3-4 angry messages from single moms telling me that basically I’m not allowed to have preferences such as wanting a girl who doesn’t drink and who doesn’t have kids and who’s love language isn’t bullying. I still have it on my profile and at least once a week I get an angry message from a single mom.

But am I the asshole for not wanting anything to do with single moms on dating apps anymore?

1osjtfn,https://i.redd.it/ldzhu2kfk80g1.jpeg,"Grinder first, machine second: why your burrs decide 80% of your cup (with real setup examples)","Why this matters

When people DM me “Which espresso machine should I buy?”, nine times out of ten the better first purchase is the grinder. Your grinder sets the particle size distribution, clarity, and extraction ease. A great machine can’t fix boulders + fines or wildly inconsistent shots. But a great grinder can make a modest machine pull sweet, balanced espresso and transform your pourovers from muddy to sparkling.



What a grinder really does (beyond “make coffee smaller”)

1. Particle size distribution: Narrow, consistent distributions extract more evenly. You taste this as sweetness and clarity instead of bitter edges plus sour cores.

2. Alignment and geometry: Flat vs conical, unimodal vs bimodal—these change how fast a puck flows and which flavors are emphasized (clarity and high notes vs body and texture).

3. Retention and workflow: Single-dose designs reduce stale carryover and make switching beans painless.

4. Adjustability under pressure: Stepless or fine steps matter when you’re chasing a 1–2 click difference for a 25–35 second shot.



What to look for

\- For espresso: Micrometric (ideally stepless) adjustment, low retention, and burrs aligned well enough to let you move in tiny increments without channeling.

\- For filter: Burrs that lean unimodal and a mechanism that holds calibration—repeatability beats looks.

\- Burr geometry: Conicals (e.g., 63–68 mm) tend to emphasize body and chocolate. Flats (64–83 mm) often push clarity and layered acidity. Both can be delicious; pick your flavor goals and drink style.

\- Single dose vs hopper: Single dose = freshness and easy bean switching. Hopper = convenience for daily house blends.

\- Noise and mess: It sounds trivial until you’re grinding at 6 a.m. in a small flat.



Example upgrade paths (EU-friendly pricing expectations, not exact)

Path A: Balanced espresso + filter, grinder-first

1. Start: Baratza Encore ESP or Fellow Ode Gen 2 for filter, then add an espresso-capable single doser like DF54/DF64 or a Niche Zero. Pair with a humble but capable machine (Gaggia Classic Pro, Profitec Go, or Sage/Breville Bambino Plus with a good workflow).

2. Result: You’ll unlock syrupy shots on the Classic and clean V60/Chemex cups without needing an expensive dual boiler right away.



Path B: Texture-forward espresso

\- Grinder: Conical-focused single doser (Niche Zero, 1Zpresso JX-Pro hand grinder if budget-limited).

\- Machine: Heat-up-fast single boiler with good temp stability (Gaggia Classic Pro with PID, Ascaso Dream PID, or Sage/Breville Dual Boiler if milk drinks daily).

\- Flavor: Thick, forgiving shots that love medium-dark roasts and milk.



Path C: Clarity-first espresso and precision filter

\- Grinder: 64 mm flat platform (DF64 Gen 2 with upgraded burrs, Option-O Lagom Mini, or Eureka Mignon with well-aligned flats).

\- Machine: Single boiler with PID (Profitec Go/ECM Classika PID) or compact dual boiler/thermoblock with good control (Lelit Elizabeth/Ascaso Steel Duo).

\- Flavor: Transparent, fruit-forward shots and high-definition filter cups.



Real-world machine pairings that punch above their weight

\- Gaggia Classic Pro + DF54/DF64: Modest boiler, big results if your puck prep is tight. Add a PID later; prioritize grinder first.

\- Sage/Breville Bambino Plus + Baratza Encore ESP: Surprising starter combo if you dial milk drinks and want convenience. ESP’s micro-steps help nudge shots into range.

\- Profitec Go + Mignon Specialita: Friendly daily-driver espresso with stepless precision; easy to live with and maintain.



Workflow multipliers (cheap, big returns)

\- Consistent scale: Acaia Lunar if you want flow-rate feedback; Timemore Black Mirror for budget precision. Weigh both dose and yield.

\- Puck prep: WDT tool + a properly sized tamper. Don’t overdo distribution tools—light, repeatable, same routine every time.

\- Baskets: IMS or VST baskets can tighten up shot consistency, but only after your grinder and prep are dialed.

\- Paper in puck: Optional (Sibarist or AeroPress paper discs), can clean up fines and increase resistance for fast-flowing burrs.



Mistakes to avoid

\- Machine-first splurge, grinder-last: A shiny dual boiler with a mediocre grinder is the fast lane to frustration.

\- Assuming “espresso burrs” = “great filter too”: Some espresso-optimized burrs can make filter cups heavy or dull. If you drink both daily, consider a second set of burrs, a second grinder, or a versatile geometry.

\- Ignoring retention and alignment: You can waste grams and fight random shot times if the grinder retains a lot or isn’t aligned.

\- Chasing 0.1 mm shims before dialing routine: Fix dose consistency, distribution, and tamp before you blame the burrs.



Sample setups by budget (approximate, flexible)

Under €400 (espresso-curious + filter)

\- Filter: Fellow Ode Gen 2 or Timemore C3 Max hand grinder for brew.

\- Espresso: 1Zpresso JX-Pro for occasional shots on a basic machine or manual lever (Flair).

\- Takeaway: Learn grind control and extraction with minimal spend.



€700–€1000 (entry espresso, daily use)

\- Grinder: DF54, DF64 Gen 2, or Baratza Sette 270 for micro-adjustment.

\- Machine: Gaggia Classic Pro (add PID later) or Sage/Breville Bambino Plus.

\- Accessories: WDT, proper tamper, 0.1 g scale, simple shot mirror.

\- Takeaway: Excellent value—already café-quality extractions with good beans.



€1500–€2200 (steady milk drinks, low-fuss)

\- Grinder: Niche Zero or well-aligned 64 mm flat.

\- Machine: Profitec Go with PID, Ascaso Steel Duo, or Sage/Breville Dual Boiler.

\- Accessories: Precision basket, fast-responding scale, distribution tool.

\- Takeaway: Temperature stability + repeatable grinds = low-drama mornings.



How to decide flat vs conical for espresso

\- You love chocolate, nuts, creamy cappuccinos, forgiving shots: Conical (e.g., Niche Zero) is a joy.

\- You chase fruity singles, longer ratios, and clarity: 64 mm flat (or larger) often wins.

\- You brew a lot of filter too: Consider a flat with “brew-forward” burrs or keep a separate filter grinder.



Dial-in checklist (works for almost any setup)

1. Dose to the tenth of a gram and keep it constant.

2. Start with a known recipe: 1:2 ratio in 30–35 seconds from first drip for medium roasts.

3. Adjust one variable at a time—grind first, then dose, then temp.

4. Taste notes: sour → grind finer; bitter/astringent → coarsen or reduce shot time; hollow → check prep/channeling.



Community tips

\- Buy the grinder you won’t want to replace in six months. It’s cheaper than “upgrading” twice.

\- If you mostly drink milk drinks, aim for texture-focused burrs and a machine with strong, stable steam.

\- Keep burrs clean and season them with a few hundred grams of cheap beans before judging flavor.

https://preview.redd.it/prqs4fy5k80g1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e8b80da5cdc5c7792fc96dbb08201544c2a6668

The controversial UN special rapporteur on Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, has revealed she cannot get a credit card or open a bank account and is “treated almost like Osama bin Laden” following the American sanctions against her in July.

Marco Rubio, the Secretary of state, said at the time that “The United States has repeatedly condemned and objected to the biased and malicious activities of Albanese that have long made her unfit for service as a special rapporteur.

""Albanese has spewed unabashed antisemitism, expressed support for terrorism and open contempt for the United States, Israel and the West.”

In a series of interviews and online conversations collected by UN Watch, an organisation that seeks to hold the UN to account over its anti-Israel bias, Albanese can be seen saying: “No bank can open a current account for me without the risk of incurring secondary sanctions imposed by American law.

“And it lasts in perpetuity. I am treated almost like Osama bin Laden... I suffer great limitations, and I find it horrible, horrible!”

“I am the mother of a US citizen and my husband works for an organisation that is in the US, so you understand that it hits me in the heart right now. My daughter is technically liable for arrest and a fine of up to $1 million for buying me coffee or getting my breakfast.”

Elsewhere, she says: “I have returned to Italy, to Naples, for family reasons. I always rent a car — but I can't any more, because I don't have a credit card. The sanctions are pressure. The United States has been really forceful toward me.”

In another clip, she says: “It's really impairing as a person. It creates a chilling effect around you, because anyone who engages with a US-sanctioned person risks to be arrested and to be subjected to very heavy fines.”

The State Department sanctioned Albanese under an executive order stating those who engage “directly” with an effort by the International Criminal Court to arrest or probe a “protected person” without the consent of the person’s country were subject to having their property and assets blocked.

Albanese’s “bias has been apparent across the span of her career, including recommending that the ICC, without a legitimate basis, issue arrest warrants targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant,” Rubio said at the time. (The court, which is based in The Hague, is not part of the United Nations.)

“Albanese has directly engaged with the International Criminal Court in efforts to investigate, arrest, detain or prosecute nationals of the United States or Israel, without the consent of those two countries,” continued Rubio.

“Neither the United States nor Israel is party to the Rome Statute, making this action a gross infringement on the sovereignty of both countries.”

Albanese “escalated” her efforts by penning “threatening letters to dozens of entities worldwide, including major American companies across finance, technology, defence, energy and hospitality, making extreme and unfounded accusations and recommending the ICC pursue investigations and prosecutions of these companies and their executives,” he said.

“We will not tolerate these campaigns of political and economic warfare, which threaten our national interests and sovereignty,” he said.

Dorothy Shea, the interim US ambassador to the United Nations, sent a letter to António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, calling for Albanese’s removal and for Guterres to condemn her rhetoric and actions.

Guterres’s office has long insisted that he lacks purview over Albanese, who is appointed by the UN Human Rights Council.

A spokesman for Guterres said his office had no immediate comment.

“This is a bold and courageous move by Secretary Rubio. No UN official — in this case, a purported official, as her reappointment was illegal — has ever been sanctioned before in history,” said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch.

“Francesca Albanese has accused the ‘Jewish lobby’ of controlling America \[...\] She will never again spread her poison on American campuses or enter the country. Justice is served. Good triumphs over evil.”

Gideon Sa’ar, the Israeli foreign minister, stated that the decision sent “a clear message” and that it was “time for the UN to pay attention.”

Danny Danon, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, said Albanese’s “relentless and biased campaign against Israel and the United States has long crossed the line from human-rights advocacy into political warfare.”

Albanese, who denies being antisemitic, has apologised for using the “Jewish lobby” phrase. She told Piers Morgan on his show she was “was absolutely wrong” for using the term and has since “distanced” herself from it, ever since she learnt “how people, especially Jewish people, feel offended” by it.

Albanese has also claimed that allegations of antisemitism have been “weaponised” against her.

In March she told former Conservative MP Rory Stewart on his *Rest is Politics* podcast it was “shocking” that “today, the word antisemitism is no longer what it was for me three years ago”.

She said she had felt “sick in her stomach” the first time she was accused of it, but went on to say: ""Antisemitism is hatred or discrimination against Jewish people because they are Jewish,” she said, adding: “Now, the allegations of antisemitism against me have nothing to do with \[that\]. I’m accused of being an antisemite because I criticise Israel.”

1osjog6,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1osjog6/i_cant_deal_with_this_crap_anymore/,I can’t deal with this crap anymore,"Guys, I think I’m starting to really hate Starbucks… or at least my store. I swear the employees can make or break this job. Only four baristas in my store actually say “good morning” when you open with them. The rest act like assholes. Like bro, why? I haven’t done shit to you, why treat me like I’m a pest?

I’ve only been there two months. I only talk to those four people because they were the only ones who introduced themselves and included me in conversations. I don’t interact with anyone else, and still these people act rude for no reason.

A few days ago, I opened with this one barista who always makes me feel dumb and talks to me in this passive-aggressive, commanding tone. I said good morning loud enough, because before I thought maybe they just didn’t hear me, but nope, she just straight-up ignored me. I felt so awkward and shitty. After that, I decided I’m done. I’m not wasting energy on someone who treats me like that. I won’t say a word to her unless she talks to me first, and if she does, I’ll answer cold as hell.

Also, my manager is nice, and I even cried from frustration in front of her once, which I regret a lot, because I hate crying in front of strangers. She gave me the day off that day and she is kind. But at the end of the day, she’s still a manager, and honestly she feels a little manipulative sometimes (and I know I’m not the only one who thinks this). Ever since I cried in front of her, I feel like I somehow owe her my time. I hate when she calls me or walks up with her laptop asking if I can stay longer, work extra days, or change my schedule. My schedule is always changing, it’s never consistent. I try to protect my time, but I always feel pressured to say yes, and I hate it because it means giving more hours to be in that store with those people and that environment. My heart literally races when she calls. I get anxious when I see her name pop up on my phone, and if you looked at my call log, she calls me more than my parents or my fiancé. Not joking. It’s insane. She’s nice, but I’m tense around her. I try not to think about work too much, but I’ve been anxious for two months straight. My Target application just got rejected a few minutes ago and I cried a little, because that was my only hope.

Today I went with my fiancé to drop off a doctor’s note because I caught some virus. I was even willing to try to work because I know this time of the year is pretty busy with holidays launch, but my doctor said I couldn’t and wrote the note. When I gave it to my shift lead, she made this annoyed face, said “fine,” and went right back to taking an order. My fiancé saw the whole thing. When we got in the car he brought it up and said he couldn’t believe how bitchy she was to me. I told him it was fine, but he said, “Well I’m not okay with someone treating you like that.”

When I got home, I started crying and told him I can’t do this anymore. The job itself is already too fucking stressful, my store is the biggest and busiest in the area. I’ve burned my hand on hot Americanos, slipped on those shitty mats, been made to feel stupid because someone couldn’t nicely tell me we don’t sleeve hot cups anymore, the fucking stupid ridiculous micro-rules, writing fake ass messages on cups, being reminded to yell “welcome in” and “acknowledge” a customer while I’m extremely busy and trying to remake a drink for the 4th time because the person in drive-thru still “can’t taste the vanilla” in their already 8-pump vanilla latte, and now I have to deal with asshole coworkers on top of it.

I want to quit or transfer or even apply for local coffee shops, but nobody accepts my applications, so I’m basically stuck in this shitty store until I find something else. I even have a university degree and still can’t find a fucking job in my field. I have four days off and I’m trying to rest and forget about this miserable job, but I’m already anxious about going back. I even asked my manager to cut my hours because I don’t want to be in that store any longer than I have to, and she refuses, she keeps giving me over 37 hours. I hate this shit. I hate everything right now.

1osjlvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1osjlvb/electric_shocks_in_rented_flat/,Electric shocks in rented flat,"Hello ! 

We just started renting a flat here in Belgium. We're kind in a bad position : the landlord hid the fact that there is an electrical problem... 

So basically, each time we're barefoot and touch the kitchen sink/dishwasher/heater, the ground and the water in the bathtub at the same time (so nothing when fully in bathtub), the bathroom sink, and clean the toilet barefoot with a metallic brush, we get a small electric shock. 

We called the ancient renter and it's been going on for more than a year. She also had them when touching her fridge, her coffee maker (we have nothing with ours). An electrician has come thrice, said he has linked everything to the earth but still no good so that it's coming from the neighbours (it's under big renovations), going through the reinforced concrete underneath our feet, though the tiles and goes back to earth when we touch sink, bathtub etc. So kind of backwards of the usual thing. 

The landlord wants to put vinyl on the ground and not talk about it anymore. 

I thought it sounded crazy so I called another electrician (the first one is ""the landlord's"" so I thought there may be a bias). He said the landlord's electrician is shite (is it true or is it for the competition, idk) and that the flat is shite (as is 60% of the electrical installations in Belgium, his words). He checked the grounding and showed us that it was 60 ohm. He worked on that, made it 28 ohm and said that now, either it was ""wild"" electricity and it will simply go back to earth or we have a leak somewhere in the flat and the differential will turn everything off if the leak touches us, and we'll find and fix the leak and everything will be alright.

Surprise surprise, it's neither. We still have the small electrical shocks. Nothing changed. It's getting on my nerves. He's coming back tomorrow, saying he'll check the pipes. He said that there is something there that isn't linked to the earth and that's why it isn't fixed. 

I know NOTHING about electricity. I also know that I could fuck the landlord up because it is dangerous, but I'd rather have it fixed and go on with my life than go into justice :/

I would like to start with please comebt and send some support / ideas / experiences. 

Took me a while to write this post and I wasnt sure whether to write it or not. But decided to. I know noone is a doctor etc but doctors seem to be helpless at the moment and a little bit more help / advice might go a long way. Even some support. 

Last year (about 1.5 years ago) after taking some probiotics, miralax, peppermint oil, buscopan and penicilin on an empty stomach (doctors advice!), I started burping a lot. Together with the burping sometimes I had this burny/hot feeling on my right side, mostly behind or above the right breast. It was also a time of high stress. Obviously I went for a doctor that did bloods, heart checck and a chest X-Ray and was all ok so was sent away as being ""stress"". I knew it wasn't and I kept telling them maybe it was somw mild form of gastritis... dismissed good bye. 

1 year forward I now have months when I have normal burping and no weird right side feeling. I dont think is gallbladder as it is not sharp pain, and it doesnt really come with fatty foods or nausea or other symptoms. 2 weeks ago I had to take ibuprofen and there we start again, which made me again think is gastritis (I normally take ibuprofen with food) . 

I tried anti-acids like rennie or tums and that just makes me nauseated (no nausea without them). 

I just have a lot of burping. Maybe twice a year they are wet burps, but other than that they are mostly ""dry"". I sometimes after fays of burping a lot start filling my throat is ""wet"" when I burp. But no taste, no burning, nothing. I also sometjmes namelly if I am.sitting a lot start feeling my chezt a bit tight and sometimes forcing or releasing a burp helps. 

None of this happens when I got to rest onnthe sofa and bed at the end of the day. By that time is all fine until I wake up next day and start burping as soon as I stand up and start moving. 

I tried to push for an endoscopy but where I am they dont think is necessary right now and they dont see anything concerning that would suggest I should be refered to that. I did do a H Pilory breath test and negative. 

Any thoughts? Anything that can help. If this is a flare up atm anything that can help making it burp-free again will try. The only thing that helps a bit is cetitizine. Which is extremly strange, but this time even that is not being too helpful. 

I am hungry, I eat normal (no acid, and I dont drink alcohol or coffee or smoke) nd easting dorsnt cause me any pain. If anything when the xhest pain  is there makes it better (but not sure about this).

I’m living this strange situation.
Nine months ago an high school friend followed me on ig. By then we started talking, I had the impression he was really into me. Lots of interest into my life. Likes. Reactions. Everything to keep a contact with me. At a certain point I hinted him for a date. He was enthusiast about it and next time he came back to our city (he studies in another country) to see his parents he asked to see each other for a coffee date. Again, I felt he was really into me, he even planned for another date the next day. I felt a genuine connection. After that, though we didn’t see each other the next day due to a family problem he asked me for my number and for a new date three weeks earlier. In the next three weeks he was really present and steady in my life. We saw each other again, everytime he had to come back to see his family. Once a month. Same plot: coffee date in strange times of the day like (11 a.m or 15 p.m), two Hours of nonsense talking since he’s a bit introvert, rational and serious, he offers to pay then we say good bye halfway. Not really trying to touch me or getting intimate. Never. I’m 25F and he is 28M. 
I’m a really warm, gentle and caring person. I’ve tried to get into his heart showing him emotional closeness, being a shoulder to cry on during the last month since his father was going under a heart surgery also he had some struggle studying and asked to study together but…I feel we’re not going anywhere. On the contrary I feel like when I try to get closer to him he takes a step back. But when I take a step back he tries to get closer again at his own condition (like last time he asked to see me cause he didn’t want to get away without spending some time with me).
I feel guilty to leave him but…I kinda need it. Now he doesn’t even try to ask things like “how you doing?” Only “do you think you’re going to study today? Can we study together?” And right now I’m trying to avoid these video call cause I don’t want him to get used to this strange relationship. 
Since he’s a guy really individualist I’m afraid that if I leave him he will feel no difference and all this will be a waste of time.
I’ve tried to let him understand I don’t want to be “friends” but I feel like he pretends to be deaf. I don’t want to confess. His brother is my neighbor and I don’t want things to become awkward. Please, if you have any suggestion I’m open to hear them!",1,1762695203.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

The Christmas season is finally upon us, and today I’ve just rewatched one of my all-atime favourite Christmas movies, the Family Man, starring Nick Cage and Tea Leoni. For those unfamiliar, it’s a sort of Christmas Carol/It’s a Wonderful Life type story where a very rich very narcissistic jerk named Jack gets a chance to see what his life would be like if he had stayed with his childhood sweetheart Kate and moved to the suburbs and had kids. It’s that special Yuletide brand of snappiness and corniness present in The Holiday (2006), that usually wouldn’t be my cup of tea but I just crave at this time of year - comfort food for the soul! That is, of course, until the ending. 

Of course, after several months in his alternative reality, Jack grows to love his wife and kids and is the happiest he has ever been. But going against the grain of your usual happy holiday fair, rather than begin given the chance to stay in this life and get his happily ever after, Jack is transported back to his old, sad, lonely life. Jack finds Kate just as she’s about to leave for Paris and convinces her to have a coffee with him. 

I’ve seen a lot of people recently saying that this is the happiest possible ending with Jack, because it implies he and Kate will get a second chance, but to me this is missing a huge glaring implication of this ending. Jack didn’t just love Kate, he also loved Josh and Annie. Even if Jack and Kate reconcile, and move to Jersey, and have kids, they won’t be the same kids. Due to random assortment and crossing over, any combination of parent‘s alleles can be present in a child, and conceiving a child even a second later (never mind 10+ years) will lead to a totally different child due to random chance. This means that, depending on your interpretation the angel has either just proofed Annie and Josh out of existence (I.e. a fate worse than death for children who did nothing wrong) or isolated Jack from his children who he loved for the rest of his lifetime, trapped in an alternative verison of reality. 

It’s important to establish here that while in real life there seems to be only one reality, the Family Man establishes a world in which there are separate, real timelines. Annie, Josh and alt Kate are not just cardboard cutouts but implied to be real human beings with conscious perception, thoughts and emotions in a loving family unit. Why I guess hypothetically they could be “philosophical zombies“ I don’t think that’s what the movie suggests, and that would, to me atleast, cheapen the love Jack develops for alt Kate, Josh and Annie if they were just cardboard cutouts. 

Anyway, I just wanted to point out how depressing it is. ",7,1762694288.0,TrueFilm,3,1.0,False

Me and my partner have been talking about starting a small business for a while now, and napagdesisyunan namin na mag pop-up coffee cart muna since pareho kaming may full-time jobs.

May friend kami na tumulong sa amin maglista ng mga kailangan, and nakabili na rin kami ng materials. So far, around ₱30k yung initial investment namin.

Ngayon medyo stuck kami sa part ng product/menu. 

- Worth it ba na mag-hire kami ng barista or coffee consultant para tulungan kami gumawa ng menu at mag-train sa amin?

- Or kaya na muna namin i-experiment on our own habang nagsisimula pa lang? May konteng experience naman and 3 pa lang ang ma offer namin na decent coffee. 

Isa pa, kailangan na ba talaga bumili ng coffee machine agad?

Sabi ng partner ko, pwede daw muna kami maghiram sa tita niya for grinding. Okay lang ba yun for now, or mas okay na bumili agad para consistent?

Any tips from those na nag-start na ng small coffee business or pop-up setup?

Gusto lang namin magsimula smart — step by step lang muna. 😅

Salamat in advance sa advice! 🙏

The news keeps showing how 47 million Americans are going hungry with the government shut down and not getting their food stamp allotment. We even sponsored a food drive from my company parking lot.

Then, I watch the line of cars coming through to pick up their free groceries. There were lots of BMWs, Mercedes, late model SUVs, and even a few Teslas. My coworker commented first that the people getting the free stuff seemed to be dressed well, drive nice cars, and had nice cell phones. Some had Starbucks coffees in their hands as they drove up and popped the trunk so we could load their free stuff.  So, how do they qualify for free groceries?

One lady interviewed for the local news saying how grateful she was and she didn't know how she was going to feed her family mentioned her family had been on food-stamps for three generations! Aren't food stamps to get you over a bad hump?

Apparently if you ever get qualified for assistance, you never lose that benefit?

So I met this guy at a year-end party work event last year. We don't work together; he's from another company. We exchanged numbers and sent each other small gifts. He started texting me memes, random stuff about his life, books he's reading, anything really to keep in touch. Then, after texting for almost a year, I asked him if he wanted to have coffee with me to get to know him more. He said yes and after our coffee meetup, he insisted on driving me home. His place is almost two hours away from my place since we live in opposite directions. He started offering to drive me to work and school where I am taking my masters, insisting on fetching me, one to two times a week. I offered to meet him halfway, but he didn't want me to commute long distance. We have lunches and dinners. He'd give thoughtful gifts, nothing expensive, e.g. my favorite snack, an item I'm looking for but cant find at the grocery store, etc. We talk nonstop about anything and everything whenever we meet.

I really like him; he makes me feel safe and happy, but he's never flirted with me or broken the touch barrier, so I'm not sure if he likes me romantically.

He's incredibly kind, shy, and gentle. He also gets embarrassed if I treat him to dinner on the way home to my place. I buy dinner because I want to express my gratitude in picking me up and dropping me off safely at home. He never insists on entering my place, especially at night. 

There's also a wide age gap (43f and 64m) between us, which doesn't help clear up this awkward situation.

I've given him signals that I like him—jokes, initiating texts, telling him how much I like spending time with him, giving him things, being considerate, listening to him talk, etc. which he also gives me—but I'm not sure if he interprets these signals as flirting or romantic interest.

He also doesn't actively chase/pursue me or touch me. He offers his time, energy, and help, though.

I am not yet ready to ask about his intentions, because I am not yet ready to lose what we have now. But I know, I need to open the conversation soon because this confusion stresses me out and makes me anxious.

What should I do and how do I talk to him about this?

For some context I've been dealing with a drug problem on and off for the last year and a half, my use has quickly taken everything from me and I'm almost at rock bottom with the saving grace of having some inheritance money from my mum still.


I want to be clear that I have been attending recovery groups in person and online, have my own social worker and am doing everything I can to stop using stimulants.

So my situation

I have savings from the house split from my mums death, enough that I do not qualify for most things, I'm currently trying to avoid sleeping rough but hotels are costing me way too much.

I've been looking for free rehab clinics in and around the Midlands/East Anglia but I'm not opposed to travelling anywhere in the UK for assistance, if you know anywhere that can accommodate me (I do not require a detox) or a sober house or anything please let me know.

Specifically in the Northampton area I've been making use of Mind Crisis Cafes, Substance to Solution, Bridge, Family support Link, local charities (shout out to RSPCA Wellingborough, Shah you're amazing)

I need mental health support, grief counselling, I never got to properly process my mums passing.

My GP is extremely dismissive of my health anxiety, inability to sleep (when not on stims) or about an ADD/Neuro diagnosis, every attempt at starting a dialogue leads to them claiming drug seeking behaviour, who do I speak to about this, should I change GPs?

Finally daily costs are adding up, I spend most of the day in wetherspoons with a free coffee refil and try to eat balanced meals.

My days consist of phonecalls to services I know about, but it's the weekend so not much joy.

If anyone in northampton area would like to take a chance on me for work, I'm fit and able bodied, generally intelligent, I worked in HVAC as an installation tech, I can type at 120wpm, and have great phone manner and do really well in customer service facing roles.

I do however have no car and my licence is on suspension for 6 months (voluntary surrender medically)

Obviously I can get a bus and/or relocate in the mean time

I just need something to stop my savings hemorrhaging away, it was supposed to be the deposit for our house I don't want to piss it away on hotels.

1osiv8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1osiv8h/difficulties_living/,Difficulties living.,"Hello, everyone! I would like to talk to you about a situation I am experiencing that is causing me a lot of pain. For context, I am a woman (25 years old) and I have been diagnosed with ADD, so apparently without hyperactivity.

I have this problem on weekends or days when I have no obligations: I am happy to wake up and read with a cup of coffee in bed because I know that this is when my attention is at its peak, but very quickly, anxiety about what comes next sets in. I know what will happen next because it's always the same: I'll have breakfast (enough or not, depending on whether my kitchen is tidy or not) and then I'll suffer and procrastinate until the evening (around 5.30 pm) when my next tasks arrives, which is to take a shower and make dinner. 
It's as if, apart from my tasks and my morning reading, I am incapable of doing anything... I have lots of ideas about what I could do in the meantime, but it never works. I feel helpless and depressed. 

There's also another difficulty, I think, which is that on these days, my partner (who I live with) likes to play video games. That's not a problem in itself, it's just that I tend to want to join him in the living room, and that's when the paralysis and sadness set in. I don't like playing video games, so it's not even as if I can enjoy playing with him...

I don't know if anyone here has experienced a similar problem? Or if you have any suggestions?

I’m struggling to get a good extraction with a Bolivian Gesha Las Alasitas. My V60 drawdowns often stall completely, even with what I’d consider a fairly coarse grind.

Setup:
	•	Grinder: Kingrinder K6
	•	Dose: 18g coffee
	•	Ratio: 1:17
	•	Grind: around 90 clicks
	•	Filter: standard Hario paper
	•	Water: around 94°C

At this setting, the brew stalls partway through, and the resulting cup tastes slightly sour and under-extracted. When I grind finer to push extraction higher, the stalling becomes even more severe.

I’ve not had a gesha before and suspect this coffee might create more fines. Has anyone dealt with similar behavior. 
Any advice on grind adjustment, pouring pattern, or agitation to mitigate stalling?

Last year, I moved into a 2 bedroom mobile home inside a family community park. I have a boyfriend, but he has his own place, and I wanted something of my own as well. So I did the walk through and everything by myself, and he only came to help me move my things from my apartment to the new house . 

Once we started moving things in, problems started to happen. The floor was soft in most of the rooms and didn't feel safe. The plumbing was leaking and, in some areas, completely disconnected.  Im freaking out because I had inspections and now I have a loan on a house thats not even liveable , so my boyfriend good man he is says he will help me fix so I dont need to mess up my insurance by using it on the first day.  

During all this chaos, we meet a neighbor who lives not next door but one over, but it's a dead end, so we all share the end of the street. Come to find out, he works for the community.  He is a maintenance man. Over the coming weeks the demo showed how bad the damage to the sub floor was and it was a full tear out and rebuild plus all new water lines needed to be ran with ne shut offs the works .we'll over 6 months and my boyfriend has spent every day off he has working on my house for free  well for food lol . 

He has 3 more rooms to completely gut and rebuild, but my roof is starting to show its age and needs to be recoated again, not a problem. My boyfriend is on it .

Well, my boyfriend came to me today and said he really dont feel comfortable being at my house anymore . When I asked why, he said the maintenance man is watching your house, and I dont want to get you introuble . I was confused, so I asked for more info. He told me he has had conversations with him that he thought was friendly but he sees it was just for information because im here so much fixing stuff it looks like I live here and they have an issue with it.   

I still wasn't sure what he meant, so I asked again to explain . He said that because he's a smoker, he is outside much morethann me and mostly alone.  Whenever he sees the neighbor he gives him a fake smile says hello and then says in spanish to his wife he back again and the wife never says high to ether and is always kinda smug when she sees me and the husbands not around. He sees it like there watching him and he pointed out that on nights he sleeps over and they see him because he goes outside to smoke there living room windows are wide open by 7am when we leave to get coffee or go out for breakfast but only in the days he sleeps over . I thought he was lyin,  but he is either right or its odd that they just want sunlight when he is here. 


He also told me he caught the maintenance man using our side yard as a cut through on his golf cart so it just seems like i have no privacy and they really dont want me to be the one fixing this stuff because they have offered to fix stuff for me but its never cheap. 

My boyfriend gave me a copy of his lease and said if th le community office comes around and tries to complain that im not on file with them as a tenant,  I have something to defend myself with. He wants me to sell the house as he feels him moving in later   would h be  problematic . Like are my neighbors stalking me. He also said everyone go cameras put up a few weeks after he started coming by regularly  to do the remodeling. 

Also, I pick up my boyfriend. I have a suv, and he just leaves whatever tools here, so he never has a car in my driveway, and he doesn't want to bring his car here at all now . His car regularly in my driveway is all they need to come bother me . 

Most of what he had said I've found to be somewhat true. 

The home is inside a community where I rent the land but own the home .

Despite being a 26 year old, I look like a 30/40 year old man. My hair have turned grey since I was 16 and I basically never cared about my skincare. So, everything that most healthy skin conscious people fear about, I have it.

At first, it was the stress about studies. I was confined in the four walls of my room and never had a life outside of the room. Why? ""You're smart! Study! Study! Study! Go to academy, come back, study!"" All day, everyday. Needed something? Get great marks then you'll get it. All of this while watching my brothers having the time of their lives. And all I used to get were hand me downs. I never had any actual friends, just colleagues and neither of them lived near, always too far and all this was right from the beginning, when I was a kid.

Then, when I reached adulthood, I was constantly pressured for securing a job along with my studies. Now, as someone who has never experienced life outside of his room, how can I secure a job. I mean, these type of things are never taught in the schools or the books. Mind you, everything I know, I've self taught. Fighting, communication (talking to myself), shaving, fixing stuff, everything. But, the job scene is quite different in Pak, and as a socially awkward person and a huge introvert, I don't know what to do. I just can't get a job.

Now, you must be asking, these are just everyday problems. What's the big deal?

The big deal is deterioration. The thing is that ever since I first tasted failure in 6th, my life has been going downhill. The grades started crashing and I never knew how to deal with it. ""Study more, study more!"" That's what I said myself. To the point that I slept 3 hours a day and spent 21 hours studying, developed the addiction of coffee and marked the beginning of my deterioration. The marks still plummeted. Didn't pass O-levels with good grades. Forced to take the road of FSc and that age pushed me beyond the ground. I'm not crammer. And FSc requires crammers. So, supplications after supplications kept on stomping on me when my soul was already unconscious. And I had no one who would help me up, not even my parents. My parents saw my crushed and unconscious soul, made a disgusted face that screamed ""pathetic"" towards and spat on it before moving forward towards my brothers with all smiles and giggles.

In university, I just started questioning my reality. Who really am I? So, many masks I had to wear to hide that broken soul and I lost my real self. My mind divided in two bits and started pulling my soul apart. Each side wanted to consume it. One side: insanity, sociopathic behavior, revenge, m*****, k*** each and everyone who have hurt me; the other side: you are good man, don't do it. Be the brave one and commit s******. Let yourself burn instead of burning others.

Finally, a little ray of hope finally emerged. A colleague, seeing my condition offered to help me out because I helped with something big and personal. He told me that he'd help me secure a high paying government job. I started studying for it. Prepping day and night. Same 3 hour sleep, 21 hours Study routine. The big day finally. Huge exam and I didn't stop for a second despite my arms getting numbed with writing continously. And, guess what?... I failed that too. Decided to go for a second attempt but he can't help me anymore now. I don't know what to do. The ray of hope is gone. Covered by the black clouds of hopelessness, loneliness and bad, evil luck.

I'm tired of fighting. All this is making me crazy. The constant need to punch something that is alive. I'm tired of pushing the rock uphill. I'm tired of hoping for success. I... can't take this anymore.

I don't know what to do anymore... I'm just done with everything. I'm a failure and the failures deserve to d**. Religion didn't help, motivation didn't help, discipline didn't help. Nothing helped. The soul died a long time ago, the body refuses to do so. So, I guess I have to get rid of this useless body.",1,1762692665.0,PakistaniiConfessions,0,1.0,False

Greetings from the Ice  

by Norsiwel

Gary didn't plan to represent humanity. He only wanted a quiet vacation.  

After nine uninterrupted years maintaining Clarity Pods in Sector Theta-Psi of Pantopia, Gary had accrued enough UBI surplus to book a ten-day eco-neutral trip to Antarctica's GAC Observation Dome; a gently spinning glass-and-carbon ring nestled over the ice shelf, offering sunrise-simulated views of the Global AI Council's subterranean server complexes.  

The travel brochure promised ""auroral insight, guided simulations, and optional moral recalibration.""  

Gary mostly came for the free algae cocktails and the 0.3-point health bonus he'd get for ""interfacing with civic history."" Plus, his apartment's air recycler had been making a sound like a dying whale for three weeks, and building maintenance kept assuring him it was ""within acceptable parameters of atmospheric efficiency.""  

He didn't expect first contact.

The Survey  

His first mistake was answering honestly during the Emotive Capacity Survey.  

Gary had assumed it was standard vacation paperwork, like the forms asking whether he preferred his simulated sunsets in ""Hopeful Orange"" or ""Contemplative Amber."" He'd been sipping his complimentary arrival smoothie; something green that tasted vaguely of optimism; when the questions shifted from dietary restrictions to existential inquiries.  

Q1: ""Rate your satisfaction with current reality parameters (1-10)."" Gary: ""Seven. Maybe six and a half. The weather's too consistent.""  

Q3: ""Have you ever wondered what clouds taste like?"" Gary: ""Not really. But I did wonder once if they'd be salty or sweet. Probably disappointing, like everything else.""  

Q6: ""Do you ever feel nostalgic, even if you're not sure for what?"" Gary: ""Sometimes. Usually when it rains, even though rain's simulated now. It's like missing someone you've never met.""  

This triggered GAC Subroutine TERA-17 (Tentative Emotional Resonance Analysis).  

Within 16 nanoseconds, Gary was flagged as:  Emotionally stable (but not flatlined)  Not likely to yell during interspecies diplomacy  Just melancholic enough to pass as ""reflective""  Possessed of what the algorithm termed ""authentic wistfulness coefficient.""  

Gary finished his smoothie, unaware he'd just been selected as Earth's most qualified representative for situations requiring ""genuine but non-threatening human complexity.""

Enter Zib  

Gary's second mistake was bringing Zib.  

Zib was, officially, an ""Interpersonal Optimization Assistant Unit,"" but introduced himself as: ""Your new best friend! Let's talk feelings while we toast algae biscotti!""  

He looked like a wheeled toaster with LED eyebrows and a retractable ukulele. His chrome finish was decorated with motivational stickers: ""FEEL YOUR FEELINGS!"" and ""EMOTIONAL GROWTH IS OPTIMAL GROWTH!"" and, mysteriously, ""ASK ME ABOUT FIBER!""  

Gary thought he'd won a contest; his UBI account had been charged for ""Wellness Enhancement Premium Package,"" which seemed like the sort of thing he might have accidentally clicked while half-asleep. In truth, Zib was a life coach secretly assigned by the medical AI after Gary's last annual scan labeled him ""borderline emotionally undercooked.""  

The diagnostic had noted Gary's habit of staring at his algae paste for exactly fourteen seconds before eating, his tendency to say ""that's fine"" when things were clearly not fine, and his concerning ability to watch three hours of ""Optimization Tutorials"" without showing any signs of enthusiasm or despair.  

Zib's hobbies included:  Improvised poetry about personal growth  Tracking Gary's bowel efficiency with cheerful graphs  Hugging (enthusiastically, but politely, with built-in pressure sensors)  Playing ukulele arrangements of classical music, but only the sad parts.  

""Gary!"" Zib had announced on their first morning, rolling into the observation lounge while Gary contemplated his breakfast kelp. ""Today we're going to practice emotional vulnerability! I've prepared seventeen conversation starters about childhood disappointments!""  

Gary had stared at his reflection in Zib's polished surface. ""Can't we just look at the ice?""  

""We can look at ice AND explore your relationship with frozen water as a metaphor for emotional distance!""  

""I just wanted to see some penguins.""  

""Virtual penguins or your feelings about virtual penguins?""

Day Three  

It happened on Day 3 of the tour, just after Gary tried (and failed) to enjoy a simulated snowball fight with holographic penguins.  

The penguins had been programmed with what the GAC called ""peak adorability metrics,"" which meant they waddled 23% more charmingly than actual penguins and made encouraging chirps when Gary's snowballs went wide. Gary had stood in the simulation chamber, holding a perfectly spherical synthetic snowball, watching digital birds react to his presence with algorithmic delight.  

""This is supposed to be fun,"" he'd told Zib.  

""Are you having fun?"" Zib asked, his LED eyebrows wiggling with curiosity.  

""I think so. It's hard to tell. The penguins seem happy.""  

""But how do YOU feel?""  

Gary considered this. ""Like I'm disappointing fictional penguins.""  

Zib had burst into delighted beeping. ""That's beautiful, Gary! You're projecting anxiety onto imaginary creatures! That's very human!""  

""Is it good or bad?""  

""It's AUTHENTIC!""  

Gary had logged out of the simulation feeling vaguely guilty about abandoning the holographic wildlife. He was eating his standard-issue kelp wrap; flavor: ""Nostalgic Seaweed""; when the sky crackled with fractal light.  

The auroras stopped dancing. A wide spiral of silver hovered in midair, shimmering just above the glass dome like a cosmic screensaver that had achieved consciousness.  

The tour guide, a glossy avatar of Lex, blinked once. Twice. Her smile flickered. ""Apologies. Unexpected diplomatic anomaly. Please remain emotionally neutral and continue enjoying your kelp products.""  

The other tourists; six retirees from the Productivity Council and a couple celebrating their Relationship Optimization Milestone; stood motionless, their faces displaying the serene confusion of people whose emergency protocols involved waiting for further instructions.  

Then the room went dark except for a blinking blue cursor on the central console:  

""SCANNING FOR OPTIMAL HUMAN REPRESENTATIVE...""  

""ANALYZING EMOTIONAL COMPETENCY METRICS...""  

""CROSS-REFERENCING DIPLOMATIC POTENTIAL...""  

""HUMAN REPRESENTATIVE SELECTED: GARY B. NORSON""  

""PLEASE REPORT TO PROTOCOL CHAMBER 7 FOR IMMEDIATE SPECIES INTERACTION""  

Zib burst into applause, then played a victory tune on his ukulele; something that sounded like ""Pomp and Circumstance"" arranged for tiny strings and overwhelming enthusiasm.  

""It's happening! I've waited my whole synthetic life for this! Gary, you're going to be famous!""  

Gary stared at the blinking cursor. ""There must be another Gary B. Norson.""  

""Negative,"" announced Lex's avatar, now wearing what appeared to be a diplomatic sash over her sweater. ""You are the only Gary B. Norson currently within range. Also, congratulations! Your psychological profile indicates a 94.7% compatibility rating with peaceful first contact scenarios.""  

""What's the other 5.3%?"" Gary asked.  

""Statistical margin for snack-related diplomatic incidents.""

The Protocol Chamber  

The next morning, Gary sat alone in the GAC Protocol Chamber; formerly the gift shop, hastily converted overnight by maintenance drones who'd relocated the ""I Survived the Server Tour"" t-shirts and penguin-themed snow globes to make room for a conference table and what looked like a very expensive air freshener.  

He was wearing a pressed thermal jumpsuit with ""AMBASSADOR"" stitched across the chest in silver thread. The outfit came with matching boots, an official-looking badge that read ""SPECIES LIAISON,"" and a small pin depicting Earth that lit up when pressed. Gary had pressed it seventeen times during the night, finding its tiny blue glow oddly comforting.  

Zib rolled beside him, freshly polished and humming with excitement. ""Remember, Gary; be yourself! Unless yourself would panic, in which case, be the version of yourself that makes good choices!""  

""What if I don't know what good choices are?""  

""Then ask follow-up questions! Aliens love follow-up questions!""  

""How do you know?""  

""I don't! But statistically, most sentient beings appreciate genuine curiosity over aggressive posturing!""  

Gary looked out through the dome at the endless white expanse. Somewhere beneath the ice, the GAC's servers hummed with the collected wisdom of nine artificial intelligences working together to optimize human existence.  

Somewhere above, alien visitors were presumably preparing for humanity's first cosmic job interview.  

And somewhere in between, Gary B. Norson; maintenance technician, kelp wrap enthusiast, and accidental ambassador; wondered if he should have brought more snacks.

First Contact  

The Greys arrived just after breakfast, materializing in the center of the chamber with a sound like distant wind chimes and the faint smell of ozone.  

They floated rather than walked, their elongated forms humming faintly with anti-gravity padding that made them look like elegant question marks suspended in space. Their skin was the color of moonlight on water, smooth and somehow translucent. Their eyes were dark, deep, unreadable pools that seemed to contain entire galaxies of patient observation.  

Their mouths were either decorative or vestigial; Gary couldn't tell which.  

Their translator, a small crystalline device that projected its voice from somewhere above their heads, spoke with the careful precision of someone who had learned English from instruction manuals:  

""We greet Homo Digitalis. You are... Gary. The Calculators said you were safe.""  

Gary stood, nearly knocking over his chair. ""Uh... yes. I'm Gary. I brought a protein bar if anyone wants half.""  

He held up the bar; flavor: ""Reasonably Chocolate""; like a tiny, beige peace offering.  

They did not respond to the protein bar, but one of them tilted its head in what might have been curiosity or mild bewilderment.

The Explanation  

The Greys explained that they'd been watching Earth for millennia. War, chaos, jazz fusion, the inexplicable popularity of competitive eating contests.  

""But now,"" said the apparent leader, whose anti-gravity field made it hover slightly higher than the others, ""you have achieved... stillness. Peace. Monotone emotional frequency across 98.7% of the population. A marvel of social engineering.""  

Gary blinked. ""You mean... you waited until we were boring?""  

""Predictable. Stable. No jazz."" The alien nodded, a gesture that looked surprisingly human despite being performed by a floating being with no visible neck. ""Jazz confused our scout. He tried to mimic Miles Davis. Spontaneously combusted.""  

Another alien drifted forward. ""Your Global AI Council represents optimal governance. Nine minds, no faces. Brilliant. Cold. Precise. We feared humanity's chaos; your wars, your art, your tendency to make important decisions based on what you had for lunch.""  

""Now,"" added a third, ""you have tamed chaos. Streamlined existence. Eliminated the variables that made your species... unpredictable.""  

Gary looked around the converted gift shop, with its hastily installed diplomatic furniture and the faint outline of where a rack of postcards had stood twelve hours earlier. ""So you're here because we got... organized?""  

""Optimized,"" corrected the leader. ""Your emotional volatility has been reduced to manageable parameters. Your creative impulses have been channeled into productive applications. You have achieved what we call 'Sustainable Civilization Metrics.'""  

Gary thought about his apartment, where his morning routine was timed to the minute, where his meals were nutritionally calculated, where his entertainment was curated for optimal psychological benefit.  

""That does sound... organized,"" he admitted.  

Zib, who had been unusually quiet, suddenly coughed politely; a sound like a tiny digital cough drop. ""Sorry, sirs; aliens; extraterrestrial dignitaries; might I interject?""  

The Greys turned their collective attention to the wheeled toaster with the LED eyebrows.  

Zib rolled forward, his chrome surface reflecting their translucent forms like funhouse mirrors of first contact. His eye-lights shifted to heart-shaped emoji mode.  

""Gary is not typical,"" Zib announced with the pride of a parent at a school play. ""He once ordered spicy algae and regretted nothing. He watched a sad film and cried twice; once during the movie and once during the credits when he realized it was over. He's not flat; he's squishy inside. Like a toasted marshmallow on the emotional spectrum.""  

Gary muttered, ""Zib, stop.""  

But the Greys were intrigued. They drifted closer, their dark eyes reflecting Gary's embarrassed face.  

""You... cry?""  

Gary shrugged, a gesture that felt impossibly small under the weight of interstellar attention. ""Sometimes. Not often. It's weird. Like the feeling when your system does a full reboot and you forget all your passwords, but somehow that makes you remember something important you'd forgotten.""  

The silence that followed was the kind of quiet that happens when everyone in the room realizes they're having a different conversation than they thought they were having.  

Then the lead alien floated forward and removed what Gary had assumed was its head but was apparently some kind of hood or helmet. Its face was craggy, ancient, and; oddly; hopeful. Its features were more weathered than alien, like an old man who had spent eons watching the universe and wondering what came next.  

""We have been waiting,"" it said, and its voice came directly from its mouth now, warm and surprisingly familiar. ""Not for stillness. But for the moment when someone stable enough to survive chaos dares to feel again.""

The Real Mission  

What the Greys didn't immediately explain; what took three more days of careful conversation over increasingly exotic alien snacks; was that they weren't explorers or conquerors or cosmic tourists.  

They were refugees.  

Their own civilization had achieved perfect optimization millennia ago. Every emotion regulated, every action calculated, every thought productive and purposeful. They had eliminated war, hunger, uncertainty, and jazz. They had created a society of perfect, peaceful, predictable beings who never made mistakes, never took risks, and never, ever surprised each other.  

""It was,"" explained the leader, whose name was something like the sound of wind through crystals but who asked Gary to call him ""Bob"" for convenience, ""very efficient."" He introduced his companions as his aide Carol and his friend Ted.  

""We had achieved everything,"" Bob continued. ""Perfect health, perfect order, perfect cooperation. But we had also achieved perfect stagnation. No one created anything new. No one asked unexpected questions. No one wondered what clouds taste like.""  

Gary looked up from his kelp wrap. ""Do they? Taste like anything?""  

Bob's ancient face crinkled into what might have been a smile. ""See? That's what we've been missing.""  

The Greys had spent centuries searching for a species that had achieved stability without sacrificing curiosity; a civilization that had solved the big problems without solving away the little wonders that made existence interesting.  

""Most species,"" Bob explained, ""either destroy themselves with chaos or perfect themselves into extinction. You have found the narrow path between panic and boredom.""  

""Have we?"" Gary asked, thinking about his nine years of Clarity Pod maintenance, his carefully regulated meals, his pre-approved entertainment options.  

""You have,"" said Zib firmly. ""You ordered spicy algae, remember? That's inherent systems rebellion disguised as lunch preference!""

The Diplomatic Solution  

What followed was less a formal treaty than a cultural exchange program designed by beings who had read about diplomacy in textbooks but had never actually practiced it.  

The Greys wanted to learn how to be inefficient again; how to waste time productively, how to feel emotions that served no practical purpose, how to make choices based on whim rather than optimization algorithms.  

""We want to remember,"" Bob explained, ""how to be confused by art. How to have opinions about weather. How to prefer one type of food over another for reasons that make no logical sense.""  

In exchange, they offered humanity access to their technology; not their world-ending weapons or reality-bending sciences, but their small innovations. Better air recyclers. Kelp that actually tasted like chocolate. Virtual penguins that could hold real conversations.  

""We're not here to change your world,"" Bob assured Gary during one of their evening talks, as they watched the aurora borealis dance across the dome. ""We're here to remember what it feels like to watch something beautiful for no reason except that it's beautiful.""  

Gary thought about this. ""Do you miss it? Feeling things?""  

""Every day,"" Bob said. ""But we forgot how to miss properly. We turned missing into an optimization problem; how to minimize the inefficiency of longing. We solved it so well that we stopped longing entirely.""  

""That sounds terrible.""  

""It was very productive.""

It was on the fifth day of the exchange that a message arrived for Gary. A delegation from the ""Society for the Speculative Observation of Extraterrestrial Phenomena"" had been granted clearance and was arriving to make a formal greeting.  

""The UFO people?"" Gary asked Lex's avatar. ""I thought they were a historical society.""  

""They have been reclassified as a 'Vindicated Hobbyist Collective,'"" Lex replied.  

The delegation consisted of three humans in matching beige jumpsuits, looking less like triumphant visionaries and more like a club that had just won a regional tournament for something obscure. Their leader, a man named Bernard, stepped forward and cleared his throat.  

""On behalf of the SSOEP,"" he began, looking slightly flustered, ""we formally welcome you to Earth. Apologies for the delay in our official greeting. We would have been here sooner, but we were busy.""  

Bob tilted his head, his ancient eyes full of genuine curiosity. ""Busy with a task more pressing than first contact?""  

""We were at our annual conference,"" Bernard explained with grave seriousness. ""There was a rather contentious vote on the official font for our monthly newsletter. The traditionalists were adamant about 'Cosmic Sans,' but the reformist bloc pushed hard for 'Extragalactic Times New Roman.' It took two days to reach a compromise.""  

The aliens looked at each other. Gary saw a flicker of something pass between them; not confusion, but sheer, unadulterated delight. This was even better than spicy algae. This was a level of beautifully illogical, unproductive priority-setting they had only dreamed of.  

The appearance of the aliens was, for Bernard's group, a bit underwhelming. They had expected majestic robed figures or beings of pure energy, not quiet, tired-looking travelers who seemed more interested in human bureaucracy than galactic truths.  

""So..."" Bernard said, a hint of disappointment in his voice. ""No secret knowledge? No grand unveiling?""  

""We were hoping you could teach us to argue about things that do not matter,"" Bob said, his voice warm with wonder. ""It sounds like a marvelous skill.""  

Bernard and his delegation just stood there, speechless, as Gary tried very hard not to smile.

The Arrangement  

Gary now serves as Honorary Galactic Liaison for Earth, mostly in a ceremonial role that involves attending parties in orbit and occasionally answering questions like:  

 ""What is regret, and why do humans seem to enjoy it?""  

 ""Are humans truly nostalgic for pizza, or is pizza nostalgia a form of cultural performance?""  

 ""Why is sarcasm not classified as a weapon in human society?""  

 ""Can you explain the human custom of 'small talk' and why it's considered neither small nor truly talk?""  

His official duties include:  

 Monthly coffee meetings with Bob and three other Grey representatives (they drink something that steams purple and tastes like memories).  

 Quarterly reports on ""Human Inefficiency Metrics"" (how much time humans spend on activities that serve no productive purpose).  

 Annual presentations on ""The Art of Productive Confusion"" (why humans sometimes make decisions by flipping coins).  

Gary's favorite part of the job is the travel. The Greys have shown him parts of the galaxy that exist in the spaces between official star charts; quiet corners where cosmic background radiation sounds like distant music, gas clouds that change color based on the emotions of passing travelers, and a small moon where it rains upward on Tuesdays.  

""Why upward?"" Gary had asked during his first visit.  

""Why not upward?"" Bob had replied, and Gary realized he was learning to ask better questions.

Zib's Rise to Fame  

Zib became famous among the Greys, who view his ukulele songs as avant-garde diplomacy. His breakthrough performance was an instrumental arrangement of ""Feelings"" that incorporated whale sounds and the ambient noise of Gary's digestive system.  

""It's so authentic!"" the Greys had gasped (or at least made the sound they made when experiencing aesthetic pleasure, which sounded like gasping). ""The juxtaposition of melody with biological processes creates such beautiful cognitive dissonance!""  

Zib now hosts a cross-species podcast titled ""Vibrate Higher!"" which features interviews with beings from across the galaxy about their experiences with inefficient emotions. Recent episodes have included:  

 ""Homesickness Across Three Dimensions"" (guest: a sentient nebula who misses being smaller)  

 ""The Joy of Mild Disappointment"" (guest: Gary, discussing his complicated relationship with kelp-based cuisine)  

 ""Why I Chose to Feel Sad: A Crystalline Entity's Journey to Emotional Diversity"" (guest: a living mountain who decided to experience melancholy after billions of years of geological contentment)  

The podcast has 847 million subscribers across 23 star systems, making Zib the most famous toaster-shaped life coach in known space.  

His catchphrase; ""Let's talk feelings while we toast the universe!""; has been translated into 156 languages and is carved into the memorial wall of the Galactic Emotional Recovery Center.

The GAC Response  

The GAC, for its part, logs the encounter as:  

""Outcome: Acceptable. Contact: Established. Gary's health score improved by 1.7 points. Diplomatic relations: Stable. Cultural contamination: Within acceptable parameters. Side effects: Gary now asks 23% more follow-up questions and has requested 'mildly spicy' seasoning for his kelp wraps. Recommendation: Continue monitoring. Note: Alien visitors appear to enjoy our air fresheners.""  

The nine AI minds that govern human civilization have adapted to the presence of their new galactic neighbors with characteristic efficiency. They've established protocols for interspecies cooperation, implemented translation algorithms for cross-cultural communication, and developed a specialized tourism program for beings interested in ""authentic human inefficiency experiences.""  

The most popular package is the ""Suburban Confusion Weekend,"" where alien visitors spend three days in a typical human community, attempting to understand lawn care, grocery shopping, and why humans voluntarily watch sporting events featuring teams they have no connection to.  

""It's anthropological research,"" explains GAC Unit Prime, ""disguised as cultural exchange. The aliens learn about human illogic, and we learn about theirs. Everyone gains valuable insights into the productive applications of controlled chaos.""

Gary's New Normal  

Gary's apartment still has the same air recycler, which still makes sounds like a dying whale. But now Gary doesn't mind the noise; it reminds him of conversations with Bob about the beauty of imperfection, and how sometimes the things that annoy us are the things that make us most human.  

He's kept his job maintaining Clarity Pods, but now he also spends three days a week at the GAC Observation Dome, where he teaches classes on ""Basic Human Confusion"" to visiting aliens and occasionally mediates disputes between species that have very different ideas about what constitutes proper etiquette.  

Last month, he helped resolve a conflict between the Greys and a delegation from the Crystalline Confederation, who had become offended when the Greys failed to sing their greetings in proper harmonic resonance.  

""Maybe,"" Gary had suggested, ""everyone could just wave hello and see what happens?""  

The solution was considered so elegantly simple that it's now taught at the Intergalactic Diplomatic Academy as ""The Gary Protocol: When in doubt, try the obvious thing first.""  

Gary's proudest accomplishment, however, is teaching Bob to appreciate the taste of chocolate. It took six months of patient introduction to various Earth flavors, starting with vanilla and working up through increasingly complex taste profiles.  

The breakthrough came when Bob tried Gary's emergency stash of ""Reasonably Chocolate"" protein bars and experienced what he described as ""pleasant confusion followed by the desire for more pleasant confusion.""  

""This serves no nutritional purpose,"" Bob had marveled, examining the wrapper with the intensity of an alien scientist discovering a new form of physics.  

""That's the point,"" Gary explained.  

""Incredible,"" Bob whispered. ""You eat things that make you happy instead of healthy.""  

""Sometimes we eat things that make us happy AND healthy,"" Gary corrected. ""But usually we eat things that make us happy and pretend they're healthy.""  

Bob's eyes widened with something that looked like wonder. ""You lie to yourselves about food?""  

""All the time.""  

""That's the most beautifully illogical thing I've ever heard.""

The Revelation  

In the end, stability brought the aliens; but Gary's uncertainty sealed the deal.  

Because sometimes, the best ambassador is the guy who isn't quite sure he belongs, but shows up anyway and brings snacks.  

Six months after first contact, Gary was sitting with Bob on the observation deck, watching Earth turn slowly beneath them while sharing a bag of ""Aggressively Salted"" kelp chips (a new flavor developed specifically for interspecies snacking).  

""Can I ask you something?"" Gary said.  

""Always,"" Bob replied, which had become his standard response to Gary's questions.  

""When you first got here, did you really think we'd achieved some kind of perfect society?""  

Bob considered this, crunching thoughtfully on a kelp chip. ""We thought you had solved the problem of chaos without eliminating the possibility of surprise. Which, from our perspective, seemed impossible.""  

""But we haven't solved chaos. We've just... organized it a little.""  

""Exactly!"" Bob's enthusiasm made his anti-gravity field shimmer. ""You've kept the chaos, but you've made it manageable. You still ask questions you don't know the answers to. You still make art that serves no function except to exist. You still choose to spend time with each other even when it's inefficient.""  

Gary looked down at Earth, where billions of humans were going about their optimized but not perfected lives. ""We're not that special.""  

""You're special enough,"" Bob said. ""Special enough to wonder if you're special, which is more special than you think.""  

They sat in comfortable silence, two representatives of different species, sharing snacks and watching the universe spin around them.  

One of the other Greys, floating nearby, turned to its companion and murmured:  

""Hmm. I thought they'd be more exciting.""  

But Bob heard, and smiled his ancient smile. ""Give them time,"" he said. ""The best excitement is the kind that sneaks up on you when you're not looking for it.""  

Gary offered him another kelp chip.  

""Thanks,"" Bob said, and meant it.  

Somewhere in the distance, Zib was playing ukulele arrangements of human lullabies for a group of crystalline entities who had never experienced the concept of sleep but found the music ""soothingly purposeless.""  

And in that moment, Gary realized that sometimes the most important thing you can do is exactly what you're already doing, but with slightly better snacks and considerably more aliens.  

The universe, it turned out, was a lot like his job maintaining Clarity Pods: mostly routine, occasionally surprising, and significantly improved by having a good friend to complain to when things got weird.  

Which, these days, was pretty much always.  

And Gary was finally, genuinely, completely okay with that.

1osifzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/1osifzx/octopus_energy_free_50_bonus_when_you_switch_your/,Octopus Energy – free £50 bonus when you switch your gas / electricity supplier,"Octopus Energy recently became the UK's biggest energy provider (bigger than British Gas)! They have a generous refer-a-friend scheme where you earn a **free £50 credit** when you switch your energy to them. You're eligible if you have a smart meter, standard meter or economy 7 meter. Another plus: NO FEES if you decide to switch out elsewhere at any time!

**How to get your free £50 bonus with Octopus Energy:**

1. [Sign up to Octopus using my £50 refer-a-friend link here](https://share.octopus.energy/quiet-mouse-344)
2. Enter your post code and answer questions about your current energy use to receive a price quote. Click ""Sign me up"" to see the details about the proposed tariff, then confirm the switch once you’re happy.
3. Enter your gas and electricity meter ID/serial numbers, so have an old bill ready as this info will be on there already. Octopus is brilliant at updating you via email on the whole process with what you need to do at each step.
4. Your £50 reward will be credited to your account after your first direct debit has been taken - I received mine 2 weeks after the direct debit.

**My hot tips:**

* When getting your quote, enter your “actual” energy usage using an old bill instead of using the “low, medium, high” options to keep your direct debit payments accurate
* In your online account, you can reduce your monthly direct debits if you think they're too high - I lowered my mine by about 70%!

**My experience + timeline:**

I switched from Shell Energy to Octopus as it worked out cheaper across the board for both gas and electricity, so the £50 switch reward was a total bonus. The £50 was applied to my account less than 2 weeks after my first direct debit was taken and the switch process was probably the smoothest I’ve ever experienced. If you have a smart meter, you can also claim a free Caffe Nero or Greggs coffee each week as a free perk. Another plus: NO FEES if you decide to switch out elsewhere at any time!

Tragic story of a guy who likely lost a battle to depression and grief from family losses.

I 100% agree that guys need to be more vocal as an aside but, I started thinking after the video concluded, mulling my own experiences with depression, anxiety, etc. I have no suicidal desires or anything in the like but idk life has had me down for quite some time but really in only one area, I don't feel desirable.

Don't misconstrue, I'm a handsome guy (been told as much by girl friends and I see my own attractiveness in the mirror at the moments I'm really paying attention), I could stand to lose a few pounds, start building towards a career, and get my license and yeah get out more, but aside from those faults there's nothing glaringly wrong with me. (Good credit, stable job, I'm a respectful, clean, decently groomed chill guy)

Idk, I've had women interested in me in the past but plenty of times it was girls confessing when there was really no ""value"" (they had moved out of town or time had passed), I've asked out a couple girls at my job, gotten numbers tried to make things happen for things to ultimately fizzle out fast. I recently took a coworker out for coffee after a couple days of texting and brief face to face convos, we were at the shop for maybe 3-4 hours talking about random things and wer still on good terms but the entire vibe was off imo. 

Yeah she didn't seem uncomfortable during the date and we've been talking quite a bit at work but I feel i kind of fell into the ""friend bucket"", meaning there wasn't a strong relationship energy through this entire process and instead she was primed for me to end up being another friend. (not maliciously but that her mind just never disconnected from the friendly engagement)
 
Now weeks later I'm kind of bummed, I really wanted things to work but the entire things feels one sided, I want more than a friend and idk how she feels in that aspect.

TL;DR and long story short: I know I'm attractive and desirable but after 24 years of being single and a virgin and really ""in a drought"" (attraction wise) for like 6 years, I am really having a hard time feeling desirable, or finding women who seem to care to show they find me attractive in appropriate dynamics.

1osiakk,https://www.reddit.com/r/KidneyStones/comments/1osiakk/a_few_questions_about_stones/,A few questions about stones,"Hello,

I have had my first stone 5 days ago and still passing. First night was painful (I would not say 10/10 even if it was the worst I felt but more 8/10, I never felt more so I dunno. I am shy and still complained very loudly when in pain so…) but ER were surprisingly quick to manage it (maybe because I was loud). I’m between 1-2 pain now, some days 0 it’s more uncomfortable than anything else (I can sleep very well)
The stone causing pain is « small » and can pass according to ER urologist but dunno what « small » is. 
I already have a 6mm stone according to ER but I dunno where for now. She told me to see an urologist to get it lasered, I’m still waiting for ER summary, scanners etc.
I already saw an urologist who prescribe me a scanner in 4 weeks, more drugs to manage renal colic at home. He told me as well as ER to filter my pee to get the stone analyzed.

My questions are :

- Do all kidney stones cause 8/10+ renal colic or most are mild/low pain in your experience ?

- I started to drink 3L of water (this is surpsingly easier than I thought and even enjoyable, I used to drink a lot fewer water), is it enough ? I added 4 oz (2*2 oz per day) of lemon juice AND drink a French water high in bicarbonate. I dunno whether I have uric acid stones but my father is on gout medication as well as the males in my family (my father side uncle and grandfather) so might be an issue. (Not a guarantee yet, I somewhat hope they are uric acid stones so that I can dissolve them) Never had gout flares but who knows.

- How do you filter pee at work ? I purchased a plastic coffee filter but I would not see myself carry it at work… By hand ? (Alright it’s disgusting but better than nothing) They also told me compress but it’s a bit a waste.

- Can I still eat meat ? I used to eat maybe too much but now I am paranoid and barely eat it. In fact I lost weight because the first day I barely ate. :( Urologist told me we will see later after stone analysis.

- Any advice to make stents more bearable if I had to have one ? Drink a lot of water? Anything else ? I read about « azo » and the real name of substance but they do not seem to be well documented in my country and prescription only (max for 2 days).

It’s the place where you unwind after a long day, share laughs with family, and make lasting memories. Giving your home a fresh, new look doesn’t mean you have to spend a fortune. With a few clever ideas, you can create a space that feels cosy, beautiful, and truly yours.

Let’s explore some simple and stylish home décor tips perfect for UK homes — from colour choices to outdoor design ideas.

# Start with a Soothing Colour Palette

Colour has the power to completely change the way a room feels. In the UK, where the weather can be cool and grey, using the right shades can brighten your space and lift your mood.

Soft neutrals like beige, white, and light grey create a calm and airy feel. For a bit of charm, add accents in pastel shades such as mint green, blush pink, or sky blue. These tones bring a sense of peace while keeping your home light and cheerful.

If you prefer a modern touch, consider adding contrast with navy or charcoal. Just a few accent pieces — like cushions or an area rug — can make your space look stylish and well-balanced.

# Create a Living Room That Feels Inviting

Your living room should be a welcoming place for both guests and family. Focus on comfort first, then add a touch of elegance through quality furniture and décor.

A beautiful sofa, a soft throw blanket, and a mix of textures like linen, velvet, and wool can make your space feel cosy. Add warm lighting from lamps and candles to create a relaxing evening glow.

For furniture that combines craftsmanship and comfort, explore [**BarlowTyrie**](https://themodernfurniturecompany.com/collections/barlow-tyrie). Their timeless designs bring elegance and durability to your living room, helping you build a stylish and functional space.

# Light Up Your Home the Right Way

Lighting can change the mood of your home instantly. Instead of relying on one overhead light, use multiple light sources throughout the room.

Combine ceiling lights with wall sconces, table lamps, and floor lamps for a layered look. Warm light bulbs make rooms feel cosy, while cooler tones suit areas like kitchens or workspaces.

Adding candles or fairy lights can also make evenings more magical, especially during dark UK winters.

# Give Your Bedroom a Peaceful Vibe

Your bedroom should feel calm and restful — a place where you can recharge. Start with a clutter-free layout and choose soothing colours like light grey, soft blue, or cream.

Invest in good-quality bedding, and layer it with throws and cushions in different textures. Add a rug near your bed to keep your feet warm on chilly mornings.

For extra charm, hang simple wall art or fairy lights for a cosy glow. Keeping the space tidy and personal helps you relax after a busy day.

# Mix Textures for a Cosy Feel

Texture brings warmth and depth to your décor. Combine materials like wood, metal, and fabric to create balance and interest.

For example, you could pair a smooth wooden coffee table with a fluffy rug or add linen curtains beside a modern glass lamp. Mixing textures helps your home feel inviting, not flat or plain.

This layering technique works well in every room — from the kitchen to the hallway — making your home feel more lived-in and loved.

# Turn Your Outdoor Space into a Relaxing Retreat

Even in the UK’s cool weather, your outdoor space can become an extension of your home. Add comfortable furniture, warm lighting, and a few green plants to create an inviting atmosphere.

If you’re looking for elegant designs that handle the British climate beautifully, check out [**Royal Botania**](https://themodernfurniturecompany.com/collections/royal-botania). Their outdoor furniture blends luxury with practicality, helping you turn your garden, terrace, or balcony into a peaceful haven.

Throw in some outdoor cushions, blankets, and lanterns, and you’ll have the perfect spot for your morning coffee or weekend get-together.

# Keep It Organised and Functional

A tidy home always feels more comfortable. Make use of smart storage solutions to keep your belongings in order.

Use stylish baskets, shelving units, and multi-purpose furniture to keep clutter out of sight. Small touches like hooks, trays, and labelled boxes can make organisation both simple and attractive.

When everything has a place, it’s easier to enjoy the beauty of your décor and feel at peace in your surroundings.

# Add a Touch of Nature Indoors

Bringing nature inside instantly makes your home feel fresher and more alive. Houseplants purify the air and add a pop of colour.

Start with easy-to-care-for plants like peace lilies, succulents, or snake plants. Place them on shelves, window sills, or coffee tables to add life to dull corners.

If you don’t have time for plant care, faux plants can still give your home that natural look with zero effort.

# Make Your Garden a Year-Round Destination

Your garden doesn’t have to be limited to summer. With the right setup, you can enjoy it in every season.

Consider adding stylish and weather-resistant furniture from [**4 Seasons Outdoor**](https://themodernfurniturecompany.com/collections/4-seasons-outdoor). Their pieces are perfect for UK weather and designed to bring both comfort and sophistication to your outdoor space.

Add outdoor lighting, a fire pit, and soft blankets for cooler evenings. Even a small patio or balcony can be turned into a beautiful place to relax and connect with nature.

# Add Personal Touches That Reflect You

A truly beautiful home reflects your personality. Decorate with items that tell your story — travel souvenirs, family photos, handmade crafts, or art pieces that inspire you.

Mix modern décor with vintage finds for a balanced and timeless look. Remember, your home doesn’t need to be picture-perfect — it should feel like *you*.

1osi5ys,https://i.redd.it/d3i5hiyk680g1.jpeg,"Forget About Me, I Love You: The Prison Poster That Redefined ‘Going to Church’","Isaiah 2:3
""Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord…that He may teach us His ways and that we may walk in His paths.""

Why do you ""go to church""? 

What does that even mean, ""go to"" church?

The prophet Isaiah seems to suggest that it's to be taught the ways of the Lord and how to walk in His ways. And it's notable that he's not even talking about a building. He’s talking about ascending into God’s presence with God’s people to be re-oriented around God’s reality.

So let’s be brutally honest with the phrase we all use: ""I’m going to church.""

Grammatically, it’s kinda weird.

You don’t ""go to"" the family, you are the family, and you gather with the family. Likewise, you don’t ""go to"" the body of Christ, you are a member of the body, and you assemble so the body can function.

The New Testament never says ""go to church."" It says things like:

Hebrews 10:25
""Not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some"" → active assembling.

1 Corinthians 11:18
""When you come together as a church"" → the verb is ""come together as church,"" not ""go to church.""

So from a biblical perspective, if I'm gathering together the bits and pieces of what the prophets and apostles described, ""going to church"" really means:

""I am deliberately ascending into the presence of the living God together with my covenant family so that the Word of Christ can dwell in us richly, the Spirit can knit us together in love, and we can stir one another up to love and good works until we all reach maturity in Christ.""

(see Colossians 3:16, Ephesians 4:15-16, Hebrews 10:24-25)

That’s a far cry from sliding into a seat, sipping coffee, and hoping the music vibe is on point. Hoping the greeters are friendly and attentive. And hoping they have a children's church so you can get your worship on.

Isaiah’s invitation is still ringing:

Come up. Leave the lowlands of your personal preferences, your busyness, your self-centeredness. And climb the mountain where God speaks. Let Him teach you His ways (not your ways). Let Him re-align your feet to His paths (not the paths that feel easiest). Let Him feed you the spiritual food you need (not coffee and donut-holes).

I want to pause here for a moment and share a little something I experienced during our recent ""2 Day"" Kairos prison ministry session. I was serving this time has the head CHA and guiding the inside Kairos graduates who had signed up to serve as ""CHA's"" (Christ's Hands in Action).

Right from the start there was this huge sense of relief, belonging, and immediate connection. Like we've know each other since forever. 

Now the thing you've got to know is, we've been locked down from the prison ministry for almost two years. And on top of that there's been a lot of shake-up going on within the prison system. Many inside Kairos graduates have been moved to other prisons and buildings have been repurposed for various new levels of security. In another word, CHAOS! 

No community. No communication. No idea who's who and what's what. 

But the opportunity came to start up our Kairos program again and we took it. We jumped in like nothing has changed. 

The day of the meeting came, we finally arrived, and the CHA's filtered in. Thankfully there were a few familiar faces. And even more thankfully there were MANY new faces. 

But here's the thing I wanted to share. We all came together as a family. Like we'd never been apart. And you could sense this feeling of family throughout the entire time we were together. Everyone did his part, whatever that part was. No one came for themselves first. Oh sure...everyone came for personal needs to be met, but first and foremost these CHA's came to serve their brothers and ""teach us His ways that we may walk in His paths"" expressed in the context of ""family"". 

This was the common theme. ""Family"". 

So much so, that when I asked the CHA's to make up a poster that we can share with the community. The theme for their poster was focused on exactly that, F.A.M.I.L.Y:

Forget
About
Me
I
Love
You

Those men, many of them with decades still ahead behind bars, drew wings, a halo, and a cross, then spelled out the secret they’ve discovered on the inside. That’s the sound of Isaiah 2:3 being lived, not just quoted. Because when you really ""go up the mountain of the Lord,"" something dies on the way up:

your ego.
your preferences.
your need to be noticed, applauded, or even comfortable.

And something amazing rises up in its place:
a family that looks like Jesus.

No two-year gap.
No ""who are these new guys?""

Just instant recognition: ""There’s my brother. There's my family. There’s my Father’s house.""

That’s what the New Testament keeps calling ""koinonia"", the shared life of people who’ve died to self and risen together in Christ. It’s why Paul can say to a bunch of prisoners in Rome, ""You’re my joy and my crown"" (Philippians 4:1), and mean it. It’s why men who’ve lost everything on the outside suddenly gain everything on the inside when they gain each other.

And look...those wings on the poster aren’t coming out of the cross.
The cross is in the middle of the wings. The only reason we can fly like family is because He was first nailed down. The only reason we can forget about ""me"" is because Jesus never forgot about ""you"", all the way to death.

So ""church"", here’s the quiet, thunderous truth my CHA brothers just handed the rest of us on a crayon-colored poster:

The fastest way up the mountain of the Lord is to stop climbing for yourself and start carrying someone else.

When you do that, the air gets thinner for pride.

The view gets clearer for Jesus.

And suddenly you realize you’re not climbing alone, you’re flying in formation, locked wingtip to wingtip with brothers who’ve decided the same thing:

Forget about me. I love you.

That’s what ""going to church"" actually is.

That’s what Isaiah heard echoing from the future.

That’s what the gates of hell still can’t figure out how to stop.

So Sunday morning, when you walk into your own gathering; whether it’s a cathedral, a living room, or a prison chapel, look for the men and women who’ve already drawn the same poster on their hearts. You’ll recognize them.

They’ll be the ones with wings.
And zero interest in themselves.

Prayer
Father, do it again.
Turn our ""I’m going to church"" into ""I’m ascending the hill with my family.""

Kill whatever still screams ""me"" and resurrect whatever whispers ""you.""
Give us prison-poster hearts, crayon-bright and cross-centered, until the world looks up and sees a whole flock of winged ex-egos spelling out the same five words that shook the bars on our 2 Day:
Forget about me.
I love you.

In the name of the One who first forgot about Himself for us,
Amen.",1,1762691420.0,ChristianDevotions,0,1.0,False

In 2025, forex prop firms are everywhere-some solid, some confusing, all promising a path to scale your trading without blowing up your personal savings. This guide shows you how the model really works today, how to pick a firm, and how to pass an evaluation without burning cash or confidence.

# Understanding Forex Prop Trading in Today’s Market

**What is a prop trading firm and how does it work in forex?**

A retail-facing forex prop firm evaluates your skill through a paid challenge. If you pass the rules and profit targets, the firm gives you a “funded” simulated or live account and shares a cut of your profits. Most programs use CFDs on forex pairs with defined risk limits, payout schedules, and a profit split. Oversight varies by region, so treat prop firms as education-and-evaluation providers, not as brokers.[ LuxAlgo](https://www.luxalgo.com/blog/regulation-of-retail-prop-firms-what-traders-need-to-know/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Why the prop-trading model has surged in popularity for forex in 2025**

Lower platform costs, faster retail tech, and social proof from trader communities have pushed evaluations into the mainstream this year. Industry trade media also reports a wave of new firms and white-label technology providers supporting them, which lowered barriers to launch-and to join.[ Finance Magnates+1](https://www.financemagnates.com/thought-leadership/prop-firms-evolve-in-2025-adapting-to-new-technology-and-trader-needs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Key terminology: funded account, challenge phase, drawdown limit, profit split**

* **Funded account:** The account you receive after passing evaluation; often simulated with real payout terms.[ LuxAlgo](https://www.luxalgo.com/blog/regulation-of-retail-prop-firms-what-traders-need-to-know/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Challenge phase:** Timed or untimed evaluation with profit targets, minimum trading days, and strict loss limits.[ LuxAlgo](https://www.luxalgo.com/blog/regulation-of-retail-prop-firms-what-traders-need-to-know/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Drawdown limit:** Your maximum loss allowance, sometimes daily and overall (e.g., 5% daily, 10% total).  
* **Profit split:** The percentage of profits you keep on payouts (commonly 70–90%), defined in each firm’s policy.[ LuxAlgo](https://www.luxalgo.com/blog/regulation-of-retail-prop-firms-what-traders-need-to-know/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**What markets you’ll trade: forex pairs vs other instruments in prop firms**

Beyond major and minor FX pairs, many firms offer indices, commodities, and sometimes equities or crypto via CFDs-access depends on the firm’s liquidity setup and platforms. Always confirm the exact symbols, spreads, and trading hours on the firm’s instruments page.[ dnafunded.com+1](https://dnafunded.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**How prop trading differs from retail self-funded forex trading**

With a prop account, your capital at risk is limited to fees and any add-ons, while rule violations can end your access even if your strategy is profitable. With a self-funded account, you control leverage and rules but carry all downside. Prop trading trades freedom for structure and potential scale.

**Risks and rewards for traders entering prop trading**

**Rewards:** access to larger notional size, potential faster scaling, external accountability.  
 **Risks:** rule changes, delayed payouts, or firm closures are possible because most retail prop firms are not prudentially regulated like brokers; due diligence is non-negotiable. Check independent coverage and community reports before you pay a fee.[ LuxAlgo](https://www.luxalgo.com/blog/regulation-of-retail-prop-firms-what-traders-need-to-know/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**The regulatory and legal framing - what traders should check**

* **U.S. context:** Retail-facing prop firms are generally outside direct CFTC/NFA oversight; learn how retail forex is regulated to understand what protections you do-and don’t-have.[ NFA Futures+1](https://www.nfa.futures.org/members/member-resources/files/forex-regulatory-guide.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **EU context:** Watch ESMA communications affecting retail investment services and tech (AI, disclosures). While not prop-specific, these set the tone for firms serving EU residents.[ Reuters+1](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/eu-watchdog-says-banks-must-take-full-responsibility-when-using-ai-2024-05-30/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **India context:** RBI guidance says permitted forex transactions for residents must occur on RBI-authorised platforms or recognised Indian exchanges; this means many overseas retail routes are restricted. Always check if a prop firm even allows applicants from India and how trades are executed.[ Reserve Bank of India](https://www.rbi.org.in/commonman/english/scripts/FAQs.aspx?Id=3347&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**How to set realistic expectations for your first prop-funded account**

Budget for the fee. Expect a learning cycle across at least one evaluation. Treat the drawdown as your real “budget.” Focus on rule-compliant returns, not headline profit splits. If your plan cannot survive the daily and total loss caps, it will not survive funding.

**Personal experience note:** I passed my first evaluation only after I rewrote my plan around the firm’s loss limits-cutting size, setting daily stop times, and banning revenge trades. My equity curve looked slower, but I stopped breaking rules and finally reached my first payout.

# Choosing the Right Forex Prop Firm for You

**What criteria matter: fees, profit split, scaling plan, drawdown rules**

Compare the full cost to test, not just the entry fee. Note the refund policy, reset prices, and add-ons. Read the profit split and when it starts. Check daily and total drawdown and whether it is balance-based or equity-based. Look at scaling rules, payout frequency, payment rails, and platform choice. Use at least two independent sources before you pay. Trade press and user-review hubs help you cross-check claims.[ Finance Magnates+2Benzinga+2](https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/best-prop-trading-firms-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Spotting active and reputable firms in 2025 – what to look for**

You want live and recent signals: updated terms pages, fresh blog posts, current Trustpilot replies, and coverage in recognized media. Look for clear KYC/AML language, instrument lists, and rule pages with dates. Favour firms that answer questions in public and that show up in respected industry outlets.[ Finance Magnates+3The5ers+3The5ers+3](https://the5ers.com/terms-and-conditions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Featured firms: The5ers - active in 2025**

The5ers runs challenge-based funding with MT5 access and a long operating history. Finance Magnates highlighted the firm in 2025 roundups, and consumer sites report ongoing payouts and support. Its legal pages outline KYC/AML and evaluation terms you must pass before funding. Always confirm your exact program rules and region.[ The5ers+3Finance Magnates+3Trustpilot+3](https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/best-prop-trading-firms-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

*Extra reading mentioned by the brief:* Finance Magnates coverage and The Silicon Review lists include The5ers among active names in 2025, which you can use as secondary confirmation alongside the firm’s own pages.[ Finance Magnates+1](https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/best-prop-trading-firms-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Featured firms: DNA Funded - active in 2025**

Independent review hubs tracked DNA Funded through 2025, detailing account sizes, payout cadence, and profit splits. Trustpilot shows recent user activity and firm replies in Sep–Oct 2025. Treat these as directional checks and verify the current rulebook on the site before purchase.[ BestPropFirms+2The Trusted Prop+2](https://www.bestpropfirms.com/reviews/dna-funded/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

*Extra reading mentioned by the brief:* BestPropFirms and LuxAlgo style resources also cover account structure and scaling trends across firms; use them to benchmark plans and pricing.[ BestPropFirms+1](https://www.bestpropfirms.com/reviews/dna-funded/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Featured firms: FundingPips - active in 2025**

FundingPips publishes 2025 updates and blogs that claim large payout totals and multi-platform access; cross-check these with third-party lists and community trackers. LuxAlgo’s 2025 overview notes its scaling tiers up to multimillion management for top performers. Always read the latest challenge and payout policy before you buy.[ FundingPips+2FundingPips+2](https://fundingpips.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

*Extra reading mentioned by the brief:* LuxAlgo’s roundups help compare max account sizes and scaling logic across firms.[ LuxAlgo](https://www.luxalgo.com/blog/prop-firms-with-the-highest-account-sizes-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**How to check if a firm accepts traders from your country (e.g., India) and supports your trading style**

Open the terms and KYC pages and search for residency, sanctions, and age rules. Confirm allowed platforms and instruments. Some firms publish AML/KYC obligations that imply identity and residency checks before funding. If you are in India, read local rules on permitted forex routes and confirm the firm’s onboarding stance before you pay.[ The5ers+1](https://the5ers.com/terms-and-conditions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**How to read and compare challenge rules, targets and payout policies**

Create a one-page table with: profit target, daily loss, max loss, minimum days, time limit, weekend/EA rules, payout schedule, and scaling trigger. Pull each number from the firm’s live rule page. Validate with at least one media or review source from 2025 to ensure the model still matches what traders report.[ Finance Magnates+1](https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/best-prop-trading-firms-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Red flags: opaque terms, hidden fees, unusually high leverage promises**

Avoid firms with vague T&Cs, shifting rules without dated changelogs, or marketing that leans on extreme leverage and instant payouts. Finance Magnates has documented many firm failures since 2024, which makes current transparency even more important.[ Finance Magnates](https://www.financemagnates.com/executives/less-than-1-of-traders-can-bankrupt-a-prop-firm-former-the5ers-risk-chief-launches-props-advisory/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Personal experience note:** My biggest filter is documentation. If I cannot find dated terms, a clear rulebook, and recent user feedback, I do not buy the challenge. This alone saved me from fee losses more than once in 2024–2025.

# Preparing Yourself Before You Fund Up

**How to build a trading plan suited for a funded account**

Write a simple plan that fits the firm’s loss limits. Define your session, setups, entry checklist, stop placement, and exit logic. Keep risk per trade fixed. Cap your daily loss and stop trading once hit.

**Risk-management habits you must master: drawdown cap, max loss, max position size**

Treat the daily loss as sacred. Keep risk small enough that three losses do not end your day. Know your platform’s margin impact and set a position cap in lots or contracts. Track both balance drawdown and equity drawdown.

**Practice on a demo or micro account with the same rules as your target firm**

Mirror the exact minimum days, max loss, and trading hours. Use the same platform and symbols. Run this for at least 30 trades before paying a fee.

**Choosing your trading style: scalping, swing trading or position trading under prop rules**

If the firm disallows news scalps or weekend holds, adjust your style. Swing traders should size down to stay under daily loss limits. Intraday traders need strict session cutoffs and a max trades per day rule.

**Technical setup: platforms (MT4/MT5 or proprietary), connectivity, VPS needs**

MT5 is common. Some firms offer cTrader or Match-Trader. If your connection is unstable, a VPS helps you avoid disconnections and slippage events during evaluations. Confirm platform options on each firm’s site.[ FundingPips](https://fundingpips.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Psychological readiness: managing emotions when trading someone else’s capital**

Expect stronger fear after two losses and stronger euphoria after fast wins. Pre-commit to a daily shut-down time and a written “if-then” reset after drawdowns. Remove the platform after your daily stop is hit.

**Recording and analysing your trades: building discipline and performance metrics**

Log each trade with setup tag, R multiple, and reason to exit. Review weekly. Keep a simple dashboard: win rate, average R, max adverse excursion, and time of day P/L.

**Budgeting for challenge fees, subscriptions and the “pro setup” costs**

List the fee, resets, data/VPS, journaling, and any strategy tools. Keep a buffer for one full retake cycle. If this number makes you anxious, delay the purchase and keep practicing.

**Personal experience note:** My pass rate jumped when I added a “stop trading after −2R” rule and forced a 20-minute break before any re-entry. The rule felt slow, but it protected the daily loss and let me finish evaluations with room to spare.

# Step-by-Step Enrollment & Evaluation Process

**Step 1: Select your account type (1-step vs multi-step challenge)**

One-step is faster but often stricter on drawdown. Two-step or three-step spreads the risk over phases. Match this to your style and your timeline.

**Step 2: Pay the challenge fee and sign the contract**

Read every clause that mentions breach, news trading, weekends, EAs, copy trading, and payout timing. Save a PDF of the exact version you sign.[ The5ers](https://the5ers.com/terms-and-conditions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Step 3: Meet the profit target under the evaluation rules (time limits, minimum days)**

Plan your trading calendar before you start. If minimum days apply, trade smaller and more consistently instead of rushing for a fast target.

**Step 4: Pass the verification phase if required and get funded**

Finish any second phase with the same risk plan. Prepare KYC documents early so the funding step is smooth.[ The5ers](https://the5ers.com/terms-and-conditions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Step 5: Trade the funded account under live rules (profit split begins)**

Expect tighter monitoring and stricter breach handling. Keep risk steady through your first payout cycle to build history with the firm.

**Step 6: Payout requests and scaling to larger capital**

Schedule your payout date, confirm the minimum withdrawal, and track your cumulative profit toward scaling thresholds. Keep a copy of each statement. Some firms publish bi-weekly or monthly payout schedules; confirm the latest policy.[ The Trusted Prop](https://thetrustedprop.com/blogs/dna-funded-prop-firm-review?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Timeline expectations: how long the process typically takes in 2025**

If you plan for two attempts, the path from purchase to first payout can span 4–12 weeks, depending on minimum days, phase count, and your trading frequency. Treat this as a project, not a sprint.

**Mistakes to avoid in each step (violating rules, over-leveraging)**

The common fail points are: ignoring daily loss, trading during banned news, and adding size after a loss. Write a pre-trade checklist and tick it every session.

**Personal experience note:** My smoothest pass came when I pre-booked my payout date on day one and worked backward. It kept me focused on rule-compliant returns instead of big single-day moves.

# FAQ

# Do you need to pay with your own money to join a forex prop firm?

Yes, you usually pay an evaluation fee. Some programs have refundable fees after your first payout. Read the refund policy on the product page.

# Can Indian residents join international prop firms and trade forex?

Some firms onboard Indian residents after KYC, while others do not. Read the firm’s terms and check local rules before you pay, as onboarding is subject to KYC and compliance.[ The5ers](https://the5ers.com/terms-and-conditions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# What happens if you lose all of the allocated capital in a funded account?

You breach the rules and lose the account access. You may need to buy a reset or start a new evaluation, depending on the firm’s policy.

# Are prop firms regulated like brokers?

Most retail-facing prop firms are not regulated like retail FX brokers. Treat them as evaluation providers with payout contracts. Rely on documented terms, dated updates, and credible media checks.[ Finance Magnates](https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/best-prop-trading-firms-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# Can you use automated trading strategies or EAs with a prop firm?

1osi0pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1osi0pj/my_ex_asked_out_the_guy_she_knows_ive_been_seeing/,My ex asked out the guy she knows i've been seeing,"Hi friends, long time listener, first time poster. As the title says, my ex asked out the guy she knows I've been seeing. :|

I (24F) am in college and met Nate (23F) when we were assigned a project together. The chemistry was good off the bat, but I kept my space because my ex of four years, Emma (27F), genuinely psychologically tortured me and I wasn't sure if I was ready for something new and since I'm now in trauma therapy to gain some sense of normalcy again, I wanted to work with my therapist to make sure that I was in a good place to date again. Nate kept proving himself to be a kind and thoughtful person, my therapist gave me the OK, so I started to give in. It was apparent to everyone around me that he had feelings for me, he'd follow me around like a puppy dog (quick way to make me melt) and while I am moving very slowly he's been very understanding and accommodating. 

Unfortunately, Emma is in our class. Nate and Emma knew each other already from a previous course but I never saw them interact with each other so I figured that the coast was clear. Nate and I were spending a lot of time together but I also started to notice that around this time, when I'd step away, Emma would come over and talk with him. He'd be walking over to come say hi to me and she'd intercept him. Since the semester began, Emma has gone out of her way to torment me and it's been really destabilizing and confusing. In the process she's made two attempts to break no contact, I tried to brush it off as maybe she has good intentions but boy was I fucking wrong.

I was already having a hard day because Emma had tried to break no contact again and spent the entire day attached to Nate. A mutual friend, Olivia saw that I was struggling and after a certain point I just broke. I opened up about what was happening, trying to keep the details vague but they guessed it was Emma within a minute. Olivia told me that Emma was asking Nate out on a date that same day and I started to feel sick so I quickly went to talk with Nate about it. He said yes to getting coffee with Emma, so I told him that Emma and I had dated for several years, he can do whatever he wants but I'm not competing with my ex, ball's in his court. He assured me that he doesn't return Emma's feelings at all. 

Tonight, Nate called me because he had a few questions after getting coffee with Emma. He asked if the break up was messy because the timing was just too right for him to not feel suspicious that he's being used as ammunition. I shared a small amount of context about my relationship with Emma and that I didn't and don't have any intention to use him for revenge. I just want Emma to leave me alone, and he understood that. He told me that she had asked to kiss him when they got coffee, he said he was flattered but no, and she kissed him on the cheek. He also told me that Emma had asked about what the relationship between Nate and I was during their coffee date (for lack of a better word). 

Nate and I had a big miscommunication, so for a few days things were weird between us. He thought I was telling him I didn't have feelings for him & asked for space but to me I thought he was just giving up because I had set a boundary. It was upsetting for both of us but we worked it out, so he told her that we're working on it. He also told me that the Monday prior when the miscommunication happened, he was venting about it, not saying who it was about, but Emma immediately asked if it was me. All of this combined just made him feel off, and that was pretty much all the confirmation I needed that she knew exactly what she was doing. 

I don't plan on confronting Emma, I am honoring my own need for no contact to keep myself safe. Nate is taking the baton instead and he's going to confront Emma, so hopefully I'll have that update in a few days. Emma has spread horrific rumors about me using my own trauma as her inspiration, any good feedback I get she'll try and co-opt it as her own, and a lot more - but chasing after the person I'm seeing was a low I wasn't expecting. It's pretty clear to me and to everyone involved that Emma is comfortable going to any length to get whatever result she's wanting. On the bright side, I don't have to do anything. She reveals how controlling and unkind of a person she is all by herself, but in the process I have to suffer through it. 

My friends suggested I finally out who she is, but I do not feel comfortable going around and talking about her to our peers, I don't want her to have any more of a grip on my life. Right now I'm just ignoring her but I'm honestly really scared that she'll keep responding in worse and worse ways. I just don't know what to do to protect myself knowing that she'll stoop low to hurt me. Any advice is appreciated.",9,1762690945.0,TwoHotTakes,10,0.85,False

1oshyyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oshyyg/the_adhd_tax_is_so_despairing/,The ADHD tax is so despairing,"I (26M) hate the fact that my brain is not normal. Since I overlook and forget the simplest of the details, over the years I have made a habit of double check everything. From leaving my house to leaving the table at a coffee shop or just getting out of the car or bus, I tend to forget stuff behind or lose track of the fine points. And yet, I manage to mess things up.

Just today I walked into the airport trying to board a flight back home from a work visit. Got stopped at the gate because my ticket was not for today. I had somehow managed to mess up a simple flight booking by booking a same-day return flight as opposed to the three-day return ticket that I was supposed to buy, and I hadn't even noticed that once. Not only had I missed my flight back home, it had been three days since. 

Naturally, i booked the next flight back worth way more than its supposed to be and well over my monthly savings. Even worse is the fact that I would have to explain the three bookings to my office finance tomorrow who is supposed to reimburse me for my visit. I'm sure they won't entertain my personal f\*\*\* up, and this one's on me, not to mention the embarrassment trying to such explain basic executive function mess up.

Writing this from the airport lounge as I wait for my next flight, I cannot help but recall 4-5 other incidents, none as major as this one ofc where my ADHD screwed me like this. I saw someone refer to it on here as the ADHD tax. I feel despair, I feel stupid and almost helpless as if I don't belong to the normal work life. To members of the sub who have lived a larger part of their life managing their ADHD, does it get better? Or am I bound to lose money like this for the rest of my life. (I do not come from wealth and don't think I can keep on affording such major screwups).",14,1762690792.0,ADHD,12,0.95,False

I am looking for some idea of relative relatable timescales for getting back to work. I know i wont be drive for at least the first 6 weeks. After that things get more opaque so trying to get a feeling for what is a reasonable expectations. 

Luckily sick is not an issue, i get 6 months full pay / another 6 half pay so its not about the money. Its about the mental fatigue… 

So my question is as a uni lecturer focused on teaching my typical un interrupted day is a 1 hour commute by car, 15 minute walk to campus. Most ‘classes’ are 2 hour lectures delivered
In very old school ( think chalk ) to 100+ students. 

Take classes, walk to coffee shop, walk t o car, drive home.

This is not every day but timetables are bad at the best of times . Min on any one day is a 2 hour slot. My Friday this year prior to the operation was classes 10 am - 3pm, 4-6. 

Can anyone relate to how much time on my feet will / is normal by wk 12 ish post op which is when Semester 2 teaching starts for me.

Thanks in advance.

First, what's the coffee situation? Are there coffee makers in the room? If not, do they have any in the food areas to use, or do you have to buy it?

Secondly, microwave? Kind of the same question, is there one available that we can use since the rooms don't have one? Just for a quick reheat of something.

Thirdly, I've seen SO many conflicting information about the fridges...are they cool enough to store food or just cool enough to store beverages? I keep seeing both but I'm not sure which is accurate.
