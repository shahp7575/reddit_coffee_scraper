1pluomq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pluomq/left_totally_confused/,Left totally confused,"Im aware this story may just sound like the typical 'Shes just not into you mate'... But the whole context has left me so confused.

Organised a date through hinge with a girl (28), I'm 31 male. First date was nice, could tell we both liked each other after our walk and coffee. She told me she is starting a full time course in a city a couple hours away. Second date was organised a few weeks later when she was back home, it was a late evening meet up for a few drinks at a couple of pubs. The night ended with us kissing and laughing and her standing up and saying to me ""We're doing this again"", then she left. Thats the last I saw of her.

I told her after the date that I liked her and want to get to know her more, and she reciprocated that message. But since then it was difficult to organise another date, I offered to travel to her which she agreed over messages would be great to do, but nothing ever materialised as she was always too busy going on nights out with her new house/course friends. Weeks went by until she was eventually coming home again, we spoke every few days on messages in this time, it was always fun and flirty and with me trying to organise a meet up and her agreeing we needed to 'definitely organise something'.

She started to go a little quiet on me, and the weekend she was back home I received a very long message of how she is just too busy and overwhelmed with her new studies, revising, course work and meeting up with her own friends when home, and socialising with her new course friends and she apologised for going quiet, but let me know it was too much for her to also be dating/getting to know me and that I deserve someone who'll agree to my many date suggestions that I offered.

But... she ended the message telling me ""I do like you though, and maybe we can meet up properly when im home"" so it was all an ambiguous message which had me so confused. I dont really have a reason not to believe what she said.

At first I just took it as a rejection and I replied thanking her for being honest, but I really do like her, how we have similar interests, had fun dates and that I think she's gorgeous and would like to get to know her more.

Since then, 3 weeks passed and thinking to myself ""Surely someone at 28 years old wouldn't tell someone they liked them without meaning it?"", so I dropped a message asking how she was getting on, keeping the door open for when she was home full time. She kindly replied with a joke and a couple of questions to me. I naturally responded to her questions which were fun and normal and came across like she was interested in how I was getting on.

BUT... I have now been left on 'delivered' for 2 weeks. Ghosted. Which I never thought I would be at 31, by a 28 year old. 

I just cant get it all out of my head, seeing her out with friends via social media when shes back home and thinking about being told by her that she likes me and maybe we could meet up properly when she's back. But clearly that's not going to be the case. 

I cant explain how absolutely gutted I am, the whole scenario of becoming vulnerable with someone, the excitement of getting close to someone you like, expressing feelings over a period of 3 months for it to mean nothing. Its gut wrenching and has knocked my confidence for trying again, which doesnt feel right just yet knowing thay I still like her. 

I felt totally confident organising a date and meeting up before I met her, now I feel the opposite doing it again with someone new, its like ive got it in me that belief of ""Clearly you're not all that mate, it'll just happen again"".

Why not just tell me ""Thanks, but no thanks""? Plain and clear and would be easier for me to accept mentally.

How can I get past this? Just give it time and dont contact her? (I'm not planning on it).",1,1765656444.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

After a rough learning curve with inconsistent shots, I’m finally managing to pull some decent espresso on a Gaggia Classic Pro + Sage Smart Grinder Pro. Latest shot tastes good but slightly acidic. Looking for feedback on workflow, grinder limits, puck prep, bottomless splatter, dose sensitivity, and how to push sweetness without breaking the 25–30 s window. Video included.

[Workflow+brewing](https://reddit.com/link/1plun8u/video/s2l1xn9l217g1/player)

**Machine:** Gaggia Classic Pro (brass boiler)  
**Grinder:** Sage Smart Grinder Pro (internal burr 2 / external 9)  
**Coffee:** 200 Degrees Coffee – Brazilian Love Affair (<15 days post-roast)  
**Basket:** IMS H23.5 (18–20 g)  
**Dose / Yield / Time:** 18 g in → 36 g out → \~25 s  
**Prep:** RDT + WDT, dosing ring, distributor (raised), Normcore V5 58.5 mm (spring 2), puck screen  
**Portafilter:** Normcore bottomless  
**Water:** filtered (jug filter)  
**Cleaning:** backflush done before recording  
**Scale:** MHW-3BOMBER Mini Coffee Scale

# Context (brief)

I came from Nespresso ristretto-style drinks and enjoyed them initially, but after drinking espresso in cafés (200 Degrees here in Leicester, UK), I realised there was a clear gap and decided to move into home espresso.

Before buying this setup, I questioned whether my palate justified the investment or whether I was overdoing it. I ultimately chose the Gaggia + SGP as a solid entry point into “real” espresso, with room to learn and improve.

Since then, my palate has clearly shifted: Nespresso now tastes thin and harsh to me. What I’m still unsure about is whether I’m already good at judging *how good* a good shot is, without an experienced barista for reference.

# Learning curve & recent improvements

The last month involved many under-extracted acidic shots and over-extracted bitter ones. Results improved after adjusting the internal grinder setting and focusing more on puck prep consistency.

Recent changes:

* Replaced Motta 58 mm tamper (left an uncompressed ring, inconsistent tamping) with Normcore V5 58.5 mm
* Started using RDT
* Raised distributor to avoid pre-compression
* Switched to IMS H23.5 basket, bottomless PF, and puck screen (puck was previously touching shower screen)

# Current shot (video)

* 18 g in / 36 g out / \~25 s
* Taste: clean and pleasant, slightly acidic
* Much better than earlier shots

Feels like real progress, but still some open questions.

# Questions

1. **Acidity vs sweetness:** What’s the best lever to pull here (grind, temp, ratio, dose, grinder limits)? Grinding finer pushes me out of the 25–30 s window.
2. **Bottomless splatter / coffee particles:** I still get noticeable residue inside the cup. Is this normal for some coffees, or still micro-channeling?
3. **Loose grounds during prep:** Grounds sticking to basket walls after WDT / removing dosing ring / placing puck screen, and loose grounds falling back onto the puck when lifting the tamper. Should these be removed or are they mostly irrelevant?
4. **Dose sensitivity:** Currently at 18 g. Worth experimenting with 17–19 g? How sensitive is espresso really to 17.9 vs 18.1 g? I usually dose slightly high to account for losses.
5. **RDT:** How critical is it with the SGP in your experience?
6. **Grinder limits:** For someone focused exclusively on espresso, is the SGP still reasonable at this stage, or am I likely to hit its limits soon?
7. **Workflow feedback:** Based on the video, any obvious mistakes or inefficiencies?

1plughe,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1plughe/ynfalle_from_beyond_ancient_gates_chapter_55_the/,Y'Nfalle: From Beyond Ancient Gates (Chapter 55 - The colossus moves unheard),"The sound of Elisia’s footsteps crunching through the snow was drowned out by the rushing of soldiers and the setting up of equipment.

There were only a few hours of daylight left, and Clyde wanted to make sure the Iron Fortress was up and running before the sun hid behind the horizon, making sure that as many people as possible saw it change targets for the first time in many months.

*“To think it could actually move…”* She thought, looking up at the metallic behemoth. It seemed as if it were in deep slumber, covered with layers of snow. Elisia imagined how it would sound when the beast awoke.

The knight walked on the far side of the path, keeping close to the assembly boxes to avoid all rushing personnel from bumping into her as they went about their duties. Elisia was looking for Layla, who was becoming increasingly absent from their shared quarters after Clyde’s mission briefing two days ago. She knew about the mage’s fascination with the otherworlders; it worried her that Layla might become too entangled with them.

She had an idea where in the camp the mage might be, and her hunch was proven right a mere moment later when she walked closer to the rail cannon. Layla sat on one of the crates, blueish smoke swirling around her head and getting carried away by the wind. Mitsy snoozed in the mage’s lap, while Layla kept herself busy by sketching the enormous machine.

“There you are,” Elisia said, picking up the pace.

Layla turned to her and nodded before looking back at her notebook.

The knight raised an eyebrow in surprise, sitting next to the mage and pointing at the cigar sticking out of her mouth.  
“What are you doing?”

“This? Clyde gave it to me. Care to try?” Layla replied, taking a long drag from the cigar and fighting back the urge to cough as the fragrant smoke hit her lungs.

“Pass.” Elisia shook her head.  
“I didn’t take you for much of a smoker.”

“Neither have I,” Layla replied, taking the cigar out of her mouth and giving it a once-over.  
“But I have to admit, the smell and taste are quite nice.”

“What’s it made of? I never smelled something like it before.”

“Clyde said they have the aroma of coffee. From a place called…uhhh.”  
The mage paused, snapping her finger while trying to remember the name of the place that the Colonel mentioned.  
“Italy. Yes, Italy.”

“Interesting. Sounds pricey.” Elisia commented.

“You sure you don’t want to try?”

 “Certain.”

The two women sat in silence for several moments, just watching the otherworlders run around and set their equipment up. Elisia stole glances at Layla ever so often, watching as the mage sketched the Iron Fortress and the generators that it was being hooked up to by long, black ropes. The aroma of coffee that was coming from the cigar in Layla’s mouth filled the knight’s nostrils.

“So, Clyde just offered you one of those, and you took it?” Elisia asked.

Layla sighed, exhaling smoke.  
“I think we are past the point of distrust. If they wanted us gone, Elisia, I am sure they would’ve done something by now.”

The mage’s tone struck a particular nerve with the knight.  
“No, I’m not saying-” Elisia sighed.  
“You’re right.”

A few more moments of silence. Layla quietly closed her notebook and placed it at her side. She then removed the translator stone attached to the collar of her blouse and placed it on top of the notebook, and waited for Elisia to do the same.

Once the knight removed her translator stone, Layla spoke, her voice unusually timid.  
“Do you think they will spare us? The people of Marbella, I mean. Kyara and others, who will soon stand in opposition to them.”

“I thought you trusted them?” Elisia replied.

“I do.” Said the mage.  
“However, as much as I am fascinated by them, I am equally as frightened. They speak of their world with both reverence and revulsion.”

Elisia looked down at the clothes she wore and the snow beneath her boots.  
“I am unsure. I believed them simple at first; no different from the barbarians in the North.”

“Clyde does give off that kind of impression, I won’t deny it.” Layla chuckled slightly.

The knight smiled and nodded.  
“Indeed.”

“When they saved Flitz, I was thrown for a loop. I couldn’t accept the idea that they did it out of the kindness of their heart. They’re not heroes; hell, they’re barely even good people. I tried so hard to convince myself that there must’ve been some ulterior motive driving their actions.” Elisia continued.

Layla looked at her.  
“Do you still think that?”

Elisia sighed loudly and ran her fingers through her hair before quickly putting her hand back in her pockets.  
“I stopped thinking, if I’m honest, since we arrived here. My mind feels like it has been dragged through the mud.”

“That I can agree with,” Layla said with a half-smile.  
“The more I get to know them, the more questions I am haunted by. It is a vicious cycle.”

“They do not seem to be driven by bloodlust or the need to kill, if that is of any comfort to you, as much as it is to me,” Elisia said.  
“But can I say with certainty that they will try to resolve this current issue without spilling blood needlessly? No, I can’t.”

Layla nodded at her friend’s words and looked up at the Iron Fortress’s long barrel. The mage seemed lost in thought for a moment, as if weighing whether she should say what was on her mind or keep it to herself.  
“They said this isn’t war, nor an invasion.”

“Based on what comes through those gates, once they get their hands on the second outpost, we will know if we made a mistake.” Said the knight, turning her head to join Layla in looking at the rail cannon’s barrel.

Elisia suddenly scoffed and shook her head, nudging Layla with her elbow.  
“You know who I ran into?”

“Let me guess.” Said the mage.  
“Albrecht Perriman?”

“Hah! How’d you know?”

“I ran into him also.”

Elisia gave a sour smile.  
“To think he got away with everything he did.”

“I don’t think he did,” Layla replied.  
“He merely retained his life, and little else.”

Elisia nodded matter-of-factly.  
“I suppose.”

Snow had begun to slowly fall as the otherworlders finished the preparations of the massive weapon. Generators were fuelled and turned on, humming in unison. Clyde stepped out of his cube, looking the massive weapon up and down, before noticing Layla and Elisia sitting on the crates by one of the storage cubes.

“We’re ready, Sir.” One of the operators said.  

Clyde nodded and then looked directly at the two women sitting some ways away. Elisia’s gaze met his, and the Warhound winked at her.  
“Alright, let’s fire her up.”

Silence filled the air as everyone held their breath and waited for the calibration system to finish. The operator stared at the hand-held screen, and so did Clyde, watching over the man’s shoulder, as the Rail Cannon’s systems came online one by one. The screen flashed red several times, notifying the operator that the power they provided the weapon was insufficient to bring it to full operational capacity and that it wouldn’t be able to fire.

“That’s fine,” Clyde said.  
“Is the juice enough to move it?”

“Yes, Sir. We’ve allocated the entirety of the outpost's power to the rail cannon.” The operator replied.

“Good. Proceed.”

Layla clutched her notebook, Elisia clenched her fists inside her pockets, both just waiting to see what would happen.

As the metal beast awoke, the women felt cold dread wash over them. Its roar did not shake the ground, nor split the sky above. The Iron Fortress was eerily quiet, only the soft metallic sounds of its internal mechanisms filling the air.

Layla was awestruck as the body of the weapon began to move, its entire base slowly turning to the right, while the barrel lowered. Snow that had accumulated on the weapon barely shifted as the Iron Fortress turned in the direction of its new target. The mage kept waiting for a sound that would befit a behemoth of such size, but it never came.

Elisia, her blue eyes wide like saucers, realised why Clyde wanted the weapon to move before sundown. Something that big should never be that quiet. Perriman, standing in a faraway corner, by one of the personnel boxes, was equally stunned, despite spending the most time in the outpost out of anyone present.

Having heard whispers from merchants trading with the Vatur elves, as well as adventurers who were within the area of the Fields of Vatur, Elisia knew the weapon to be loud. All who witnessed it spoke of a deafening boom that it produced.

It didn’t take more than a second for the blonde knight to finally understand the horrifying nature of the Iron Fortress: To hear it from afar was to hear the sound of imminent and inevitable destruction. The only time it was truly loud, as many have said it to be, must have been when it fired. Whichever encampment, village or town the weapon was aimed at would remain blissfully ignorant of their fate until it was too late.  

If elven eyes weren’t watching the outpost night and day, they might not even have noticed the Iron Fortress change its target. That is why the Colonel wanted the weapon to be moved while there was still daylight left.

Layla opened her notebook and began writing all that was happening. Her handwriting was messy due to speed, but it didn’t matter; she couldn’t risk missing the opportunity to document every detail, every sound the rail cannon made.

Once the Iron Fortress had its barrel pointed in the direction of its new target, it fell asleep again. The soldiers began moving like ants, quickly and with practised ease, detaching all the long ropes that connected the rail cannon to the generators and getting the outposts' power grid back on.

Elisia wondered just how much panic this would cause in the small town of Mell, which the Iron Fortress was aimed at. How quickly would the elves and Marbella soldiers respond to try and evacuate everyone?

She was slightly relieved by the sight of the weapon being put back to rest, its humming falling silent once more, knowing now that Clyde was true to his word that it wouldn’t be used as more than a distraction.

“Filtz, have you gone mad?!” Tynaris shouted.

The young paladin sighed, fastening his leather armour and putting on his baldrick. He looked at his mother, who stood at the doorway to his room, the worry on her face illuminated by the candlelight.

“Mother, I must go. I’m a paladin. I took an oath to help people and defend them.” Filtz replied.

“You’ve only recently healed your arm, now you aim to lose your head next?” His mother argued.

Her son walked over to her, embracing her in a hug.  
“Of course not. But the people of Mell need all the help they can get, so they can safely evacuate in time.”

Tynaris sighed, grabbing him gently by the cheeks so his eyes would meet hers.  
“Don’t you dare play hero, you hear me? Do what you must and nothing more.”

Filtz nodded and gave her a weak smile in return.  
“Of course. I am going only to aid the people.”

Tynaris held him a moment longer, not wanting to let go. She had almost lost him once, and the fear of it happening a second time paralysed her. Filtz took her hands into his and slowly lowered them, never looking away. Tynaris sniffled and wiped her eyes, finally stepping aside so he could pass.

Watching him head towards the door filled her with worry, as she tried to get her mind under control before dark, unwanted thoughts could form.

Filtz stepped out into the cold, moonless night. Of all the things that crossed his mind, he thought most about his sister. Has she safely delivered the prisoners to the elves? Would he see her soon again? If so, he hoped it would not be on the field of battle, going against the otherworlders.

The small town of Mell was not far from his village, little more than an hour on horseback, if he really pushed the animal. That’s why the word that the town became the new target for the Iron Fortress reached him so fast. It was during the last hour of daylight that the colossal weapon moved, and the border guards stationed in Mell were quick to send messengers to every nearby camp and village to ask for help.

With determined steps, Filtz headed towards the small stables, all manner of thoughts swirling inside his head. Were the three men his sister was on a mission to deliver to the Vatur elves executed by now? If so, why was their weapon aimed at Mell instead of the Silver Forest? Did they know the kingdom of Marbella was involved? And most importantly, did they blame them as much as the elves?

*“Perhaps this is merely a warning. A reminder that we should stay out of their conflict with the elves. One can only hope.”*

Filtz saddled his fastest horse, which was also the only horse he owned and headed towards the village gate. As soon as he was past the walls, he sent the animal into a gallop, cold wind slapping his face and the thudding of the horse’s hooves against the frozen road echoing into the night.

\*\*\*

Many things could a human say about the elves. Some good, others less so. But one claim that was never brought into question was of elven efficiency.

Filtz was unsure how much of the night had passed by the time he arrived at Mell, as the moon and stars hid behind thick clouds, but the town’s evacuation was well underway.

The border patrols and guards did not dawdle, leaving nothing to chance and beginning the evacuation of the townsfolk the second the word of the Iron Fortress came. Many had left before the sun had even set, heading further east to villages and towns closer to the capital of the kingdom.

Others remained, stubbornly refusing to leave their homes and plots of land for the otherworldly invaders to plunder and destroy. The guards in charge, however, would have none of it. With the hour growing increasingly late, the patience of Marbella's soldiers grew thinner and thinner. Discussions and reasoning gave way to arguments, and by the time Filtz arrived, those arguments turned into stubborn townsfolk being physically removed from their houses and ordered to board wagons and carriages.

The elves merely stood by and let the humans deal with their kind. They focused their attention outside of the town, towards the fields and woodland, for any signs of brigands who might seek to take advantage of the chaos.

“Halt!” shouted an elven guard as Filtz rode into town.  
“State your business.”

Filtz pulled on the reins, stopping the horse.  
“I’ve come to aid the evacuation of the townsfolk.”

Seeing his sword and the Holy City insignia on the amulet that hung around his neck, the elven guards asked no further questions. The one that stopped him merely turned around and pointed further up the road, towards a group of Marbella footmen who were loading the townsfolk into an old wagon.  
The paladin nodded and flicked the reins to get the horse moving again.

As Filtz slowly rode towards the wagon, he could already see the sour looks on the faces of Marbella soldiers. He wasn’t surprised, though; adventurers and active soldiers often mixed like oil and water.

Three of them approached him, while the rest continued dealing with the wagon. On top of the light armour they wore, decorated with streaks of red and gold along the armour’s edges, one of them wore an open helmet which had the royal insignia, painted in red on the side of it.

The soldier closest to Filtz spoke first, his voice filled with annoyance and tiredness, which he wasn’t even bothering to hide.  
“Who the hell are you, just prancing into town at the dead of night? Another adventurer, I take it?”

“Sort of.” The young paladin replied.  
“Filtz Telabram, Paladin from the Holy City of Larmuth.”

Another soldier scoffed, looking unamused, and pointed at Filtz’s attire.  
“A paladin? Dressed like that? What happened? Did you get robbed on your way here?”

 Filtz just shook his head calmly, opening his mouth to speak, but was interrupted by the third soldier with the insignia on his helmet.

“Enough, you two!” Barked the third soldier.  
“Not all paladins are draped in gold from the donations to Larmuth’s treasury.”

The other two seemed to calm down slightly, lowering their gaze from Filtz’s face to his leather armour.  
“Right. Apologies, Captain.”

“Glad that’s understood, now go, those wagons won’t move themselves.” Said the third man, before turning his attention to the young paladin.  
“Forgive their loose tongues, lad. Many of them grew up in this area, if not in this town, then the next; tension and worry make them unpleasant.”

“Nothing to forgive, Sir,” Filtz replied.  
“I understand them more than most.”

The guard captain nodded.  
“I’m Rava, the captain of the guard in this little town. Where are you from, lad? You sound local.”

“I’m from a village north of here, not far. That’s where I came from tonight.”

“Ah, knew by the looks of you that you weren’t one of them Larmutian milksops!”

Filtz chuckled at the captain’s words and began dismounting, but the soldier was quick to stop him.  
“Don’t bother. The last wagon and carriage should be filled by now, so just continue ahead and join the escort. The group escorting the civilians to Baroak Bale, southeast of here, could use another pair of hands, given they’re a bit short on that.”

“Understood, Sir.” Said the paladin and flicked the reins again, heading to catch up with the last wagon.",2,1765655870.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I asked her to end things if she couldn’t talk to me or be like before, and she agreed. It remains one of my biggest regrets.

After two months of that incidents, we met at her cousin’s wedding and talked as if nothing had happened. Later, I texted her for few days and tried to build conversation but she told me she was in love with someone else. I respected her request to keep it private, wished her well, and stopped contacting her.

By coincidence, she works in an office that is one stop before mine, During night shift sometimes we meet unexpectedly and will have a cup of coffee. It happens very rarely but I wish to happen it daily. My thoughts drift to what she might be doing now or how things would be if we were still together.

I’m a 30-year-old woman from England, looking to get to know someone and hopefully let it lead to something romantic.

I love karaoke, museums, art galleries, concerts (Drake is my fav and I wish Frank Ocean would leave hibernation already), and stand-up comedy.

My guilty pleasures include: being a Kanye west fan, crying, reading too much into star signs and bullying the people I love 🥰😘

If we vibe, let’s grab a coffee or maybe a drink.

anyway, im specifically wanting to take advantage of their drink menu. i see the sugar free vanilla syrup, caramel syrup, chai syrup, and dark chocolate syrups are all vegan as well as the options of oat and almond milk! it seems i can make lattes vegan, but both the frozen coffees and frozen hot chocolates have milk in the frozen mix (as well as the sugar free chocolate syrup unfortunately for me lol) 

but i love hot chocolate and it appears that the hot chocolate includes ice cream base, chocolate chips, whipped cream, and vanilla syrup. i was wondering how it might be possible to veganize this? im confused because if i remove the whipped cream and chocolate chips which i assume are toppings, that leaves the syrup and ice cream base as the drink. but where is the chocolate ?? 

since the cream base isn’t vegan, would i be able to order a hot chocolate with almond milk (is it originally made with water??) and dark chocolate syrup and basically have hot chocolate milk lmao?? i’m just confused how it’s made in the first place and would like to know if there’s a way to order a vegan hot chocolate (if there’s any other vegan menu tips anyone has i’d love to know those too :)

Auren POV

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.”

“Right,” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.”

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.”

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine?

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.”

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‘Mate.’

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‘That’s our mate!’ Siena said enthusiastically. ‘Go fast. I want my mate.’

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.

Alpha Bram Thorne.

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‘Mate,’ I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‘No, go to him!’ Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

“Alpha Bram!” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.

He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn’t even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips.

My heart sank. I stood frozen, unable to move. The warmth I’d felt moments ago evaporated, leaving an intense ache in its place. The weight of his horrible rejection settled over me. His betrayal felt like a knife was plunged in my chest and then twisted.

Siena howled inside me out of rage and jealousy. ‘No, he is our mate.’ She wanted to come out and tear Maris away from him, but I knew that she was a weak wolf. If she surfaced, Alpha Bram would kill her instantly.

For years, I’d dreamed of this moment—the day I’d find my mate, the one person destined to see me for who I truly was, who would love me, cherish me. But now, that dream lay shattered at my feet. Tears sprang in my eyes.

Alpha Bram glared at me, daring to come close. Maris also turned to look at me with narrowed eyes. Dread plummeted in my stomach. I was afraid that if I went nearer and declare that I was his mate, they would throw me in the dungeons. So I turned and walked away, my shoulders slumping with miserable rejection I hadn’t even heard spoken aloud. The scent of him lingered, bittersweet and unbearable. By the time I reached the pack house, tears blurred my vision.

I thought today might be different, that I could finally have someone to share it with. Instead, I was left with a heart full of despair. Weren't mates supposed to look after each other?

I hid inside the laundry room and started crying. Was there a way to get out of this pack? The idea of rejection was so painful. How would I serve him now?

I curled up on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees as tears streamed down my face. The ache in my chest felt unbearable. It was like a deep, raw wound that wouldn’t stop bleeding. I didn’t know what to do or who to go to for comfort.

Alpha Bram’s cold, distant stare replayed in my mind over and over. My mate. He didn’t even want to acknowledge me.

Suddenly, the door opened.

# Chapter 2

Auren POV

Being an orphan had always been hard for me. According to our previous Alpha, who was Alpha Bram’s father, my parents died in a pack war. He was kind enough to give me shelter in his packhouse and even allowed education in a school for omegas. However, a few years later when he died and Bram became the Alpha, he pulled me out of the school, made me pack’s servant and gave me lowly jobs, clearing stating that if I had to stay in the pack, I had to earn my living. His lusty gaze would often linger on me, and I would shy away, afraid of his intentions. But then he would snap his gaze away from me as if he saw vermin.

I was born with a tattoo the size of a squash ball on my back. A golden moon shackled by dark thorn vines curving around it. The Shaman had kindly warned me that it was a mark of a curse and so I had to keep it hidden at all times, afraid that if anyone saw it, they would kill me.

Suddenly, the door opened, snapping me from my thoughts. I hurriedly wiped my tears, but it was too late. Maris stood in the doorway, her arms crossed and a smug smile playing on her lips and her face donned with a wicked expression.

“Well, well,” she said, stepping closer. “If it isn’t our little orphan, sniveling like a child.”

I didn’t respond, keeping my head down. My whole body trembled in fear even though Siena wanted to come out and attack Maris.

“I know what happened,” she said, her voice dripping with venom. “You think you’re special because Bram is your mate? Let me tell you something, Auren.” She crouched down, her face close to mine. “We knew it long back. But you’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing. Bram doesn’t want you. He’ll reject you soon enough, and when he does, you’ll wish you’d never set foot in this pack.”

I swallowed hard, trying to fight back the fresh wave of tears.

“If you tell anyone—anyone—about this,” she continued, her voice low and dangerous, “I’ll make sure you regret it. Do you understand?”

I nodded weakly, too scared to speak. Maris straightened, brushing invisible dust off her skirt.

“Good. Now clean yourself up. You’re pathetic. I don’t want anyone to see you crying because if they do, they will ask you the reason. I swear you’ll regret it if they come to know the reason.” Saying that, she turned sharply, flicking her hair and marched out.

The weight of her words crushed me further. I brought my knees against my chest and hugged them tightly. Mates were supposed to take care of each other. His betrayal was worse than all my years of enduring servitude. And they knew that I was his mate? The revelation shocked me.

When I finally stepped out of the laundry room, the humiliation didn’t end. Reya was waiting for me in the kitchen. “You are reassigned to work in the toilets!” she barked at me. “Stay there until you get a new duty. Don’t you come out of that place!”

I balked as I stared at her. “What?” Toilets were the worst place to work.

She slapped me hard across my cheek. I screamed in pain as I fell down. Her lips curled into a sneer. “Did you not listen to what I said? Clean all the toilets. Now!”

Scared, I made my way to the toilets, sure that this was Maris’s order.

Over the next few days, Maris, always clever with her schemes, pointed fingers at me for things I hadn’t done. A broken vase, a spilled drink, and suddenly, I was everyone’s scapegoat. The other pack members whispered and sneered, their remarks cutting me like knives. They would accuse me of everything and anything. And Alpha Bram just turned a blind eye to all the bullying.

Things settled a bit, but one morning when I woke up and hurried to the kitchen, I heard Reya shouting at others. When I entered, Reya threw very expensive cutlery directly on the floor near me.

Maris walked in just at that time like she was waiting for this moment, as if on cue. “Reya, don’t let her get away with that,” she said, her tone filled with anger. “She’s nothing but trouble.”

It didn’t take much for Reya to agree. She and Maris cornered me by the pantry, their faces contorted in anger. I sensed something was wrong, but I had no time to react.

“You’ve caused enough problems,” Reya sneered immediately. “It’s time you learn a lesson.” And then came the blows. “No,” I cried and screamed and begged them to leave me, but no one came to rescue me.

“What’s going on?” A loud growl came. It was Alpha Bram, my mate. Was he coming to save me?

“Alpha Bram,” Maris immediately changed her facial expression and said in a honeyed voice. “Auren threw broken glass at me. See, I am bleeding.” She showed him a little cut on her finger that she got while beating me.

1plu958,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1plu958/pity_party_population_me/,Pity Party Population me,"Sorry in advance, this post is going to be a bit of a self-pity party. I just don't know who else to talk to. I know I could be a lot more positive or have a better mindset or whatever but I'm really tired of putting on a brave face and convincing myself to pull a silver lining out of everything. I'm going to give myself a little bit of self-victimization as a treat.

I've been in/out of sobriety for a few years now. I'll go a few weeks or even months without drinking and then find a reason to start again. I am not immune to the allure of ""I can just drink in moderation"" fallacy. I always tell myself it's ""not that bad"" because I don't drink liquor. But, when things are at their worst, I'll easily put down 12 seltzers/beers in an evening and ruin every other day with a vicious hangover.

Right now it's especially hard because I feel like not very much is going right in my life. I had to quit my ""big kid"" job at a nonprofit and move back in with my mom because I got screwed out of my living situation and couldn't afford the rising rent prices of the town I was living in. My mom is in Australia for the winter so I'm feeling really isolated and alone. I got a job shoveling snow at night but, because there's no snow, I haven't been getting scheduled. I feel like I can't get a hold of my friends to do anything because they're either in school or in long-term relationships and they really only hang out with other couples. I was briefly dating someone but she dumped me because she said she wasn't ready for a relationship. She got a new girlfriend 2 weeks later. Besides my 2 months with her, I haven't had a second date in years. I feel like there's something wrong with me.

I feel really alone and isolated. I live in a SUPER small community and really the only public social events are at our local dive bar. The only time I can get friends to hang out with me is at said bar. Depending on who's bartending, I drink nearly for free because we're old drinking buddies. There aren't even sit-down coffee shops or places that don't serve booze here. I'm not at a point in my sobriety that I can be at a bar (or even an establishment that sells alcohol) and not drink - it never goes well. So I spend most of my hours by myself thinking about how I'd rather be drunk. I still try to fill my time with walks outside, going to the gym, doing art, and cooking, but it feels like I'm a robot going through these motions. I don't really enjoy anything anymore. I get done with my chores or whatever and it's still another 5 hours before I can sleep and I am tired of trying to fill my time with ""healthy"" activities I don't enjoy doing on my own. I feel like I'm swimming at full speed to barely fight the current.

I want to reach out to my friends for help but I don't want them to get sick of me because I need help all the time. If they don't want to take the time to see me when they think I'm doing well, I don't want to feel like I'm manipulating them into spending time with me by being sad and needy. I've had a few friends take their own life in the past year and it's so funny to me how so many members of my community say ""check in on your friends,"" in the aftermath yet never seem to do so.

I really don't want to talk to my parents about this because their first reaction is always anger. I don't want to deal with another angry lecture from my mom about how I'm too negative all the time. She likes to hit me with the classic ""people probably don't want to be around you because you need help all the time - people don't like to be friends with sad people,"" line she's been feeding me since she stuck me on antidepressants at 11 years old.

I'm 48 hours sober and I don't know if I can pledge to not drink today. Sorry. I try not to pledge if I don't think I can do it because I don't want to get myself in the habit of breaking the pledge. I need to cling on to some sort of code or values or something right now.",5,1765655336.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

More density done well. Strong, healthy public transit ridership. A fast, reliable rail system connecting Portland to coastal towns and other Oregon cities.

1plu6ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/1plu6ik/i_have_seriously_reduced_my_dining_and_eating_out/,I have seriously reduced my dining and eating out,"Dining out is optional and always has been for most people. It used to be a pleasure but now is fraught with high prices, tipping and service charge games, entitlement, emotions by diners, servers, staff and owners and so much more. 

Eating is not optional and there are so many options besides eating out. I have a nice decades old Rancilio espresso maker at home. That and a bit of milk and good coffee and I save 5 dollars a day and nobody turns a tip-screen towards me. 

And I know how to whip up a number of tasty dishes that take little time. I know what the ingredients are and eat well as a result when at home. 

Wednesday a business acquaintance is coming to town and invited me to meet for breakfast. He suggested the high-end hotel he is staying at. I looked at the menu and saw 29.00 basic egg dishes. Add coffee and tip and we are likely talking 40.00 for a simple breakfast per person or more. 

I invited him to my house. I will whip up some eggs, buy some pastries at Bakery Nouveau, make some espresso and serve some juice. And it was his money I am saving just because. 

One can argue and justify the highest dining costs in the nation and all the crap, add-on charges and the like - that one wishes. But I am voting with my dollars. Affluence notwithstanding, and my ability to afford anything I want notwithstanding. It is about a broken and alienating system that has turned a pleasure into an aversive experience. 

Now I don't need to impress dates or need to show off with my tips or anything else. But if I were in a dating world, I would impress them with my cooking skills and seriously reduce visits to restaurants. 

And owners and staff, it is on you to fix this and change my mind and that of others. I feel for those who can't or won't make the needed changes, ideally to a European or Asian model where what you see is what you pay and what you pay does not feel excessive and out of line.

I’m 29 (f) and for the past year or so every time I’ve drank alcohol, I’m physically exhausted the next day and I mean exhausteddd. No motivation to do anything at all, not shower or eat or even go on a walk without feeling so physically drained. This is a stark contrast to my life up until 28/29 where I could drink and still function as a normal person the next day. It’s starting to feel like I’m wasting days and hours of my life due to this exhaustion. 

The thing is, I am a light weight and honestly don’t drink that much (3 glasses of wine or 3 double rum and cokes if it’s a night out on average)! I also don’t feel this way at festivals for example I went to Glastonbury this year and was completely fine every day in terms of energy.

I do want to try cutting out drinking but I’m worried how it would affect my social life as I live in London and the main thing to do here (I guess in general in the UK) is to go to the pub or a bar or a club in the evening and these are generally the only places open in the evening (I don’t drink coffee or tea as can’t handle caffeine). 

I’ve researched that drinking alcohol can affect your REM sleep which is needed for restorative purposes. 

I guess I just want to know what your life was like when you stopped drinking and if it’s worth it. (I mean I know it would be worth it to not feel so drained and actually be able to have motivation to do normal things on the weekend).

My list always includes SmartWool socks and knit gloves that I can leave in my various jacket pockets. 

Triple milled bar soap (bonus points if it’s her fragrance of choice) or a pump container of Aesop. A Diptyque candle.

A manicure / pedicure / coffee - but not just the gift card, actually make the appointments so we can do it together and it actually happens with no mental labor on my part.

Past hits: Matching cloth napkins (go to Etsy and get a set embroidered with the whole family’s names, including opposite corners for people who went by two names or nicknames: eg Mom vs Gina).

This year I really want Kleenex box covers that match my decor so I can hide all the hideous cardboard patterns. 

And my husband recently bought those battery operated Luminara candles that look like they are flickering: they are expensive so nothing I would have ever bought myself, but now I am obsessed! It allows us to have any room lit with candles all the time without worrying about wax and they look super real. That would be a great gift for anyone who has or wants a cozy home.

I really wish that someone would re-line / recover my bathroom shelves in clean / cheery paper, maybe even using self stick wallpaper? It bugs me every time I open the closet door, but I know I’ll never prioritize doing them. What’s the equivalent driving your mom or dad nuts?

If your parents don’t have it and you’re looking for a big / joint gift from the kids, redoing a closet in Elfa or similar would be huge. On that note, matching wooden hangers is another thing I love and use every day, but would never buy myself.

A super nice wood cutting board or replacement high quality knives or utensils. We also always give high quality woven dish towels we purchase when we are in Norway (they might be Swedish - brand is Ekelund) and everyone in the family looks forward to reviving a pair. A set of two might be $60 but last forever and are so nice to have in a kitchen.

Auren POV

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.”

“Right,” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.”

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.”

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine?

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.”

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‘Mate.’

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‘That’s our mate!’ Siena said enthusiastically. ‘Go fast. I want my mate.’

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.

Alpha Bram Thorne.

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‘Mate,’ I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‘No, go to him!’ Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

“Alpha Bram!” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.

He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn’t even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips.

My heart sank. I stood frozen, unable to move. The warmth I’d felt moments ago evaporated, leaving an intense ache in its place. The weight of his horrible rejection settled over me. His betrayal felt like a knife was plunged in my chest and then twisted.

Siena howled inside me out of rage and jealousy. ‘No, he is our mate.’ She wanted to come out and tear Maris away from him, but I knew that she was a weak wolf. If she surfaced, Alpha Bram would kill her instantly.

For years, I’d dreamed of this moment—the day I’d find my mate, the one person destined to see me for who I truly was, who would love me, cherish me. But now, that dream lay shattered at my feet. Tears sprang in my eyes.

Alpha Bram glared at me, daring to come close. Maris also turned to look at me with narrowed eyes. Dread plummeted in my stomach. I was afraid that if I went nearer and declare that I was his mate, they would throw me in the dungeons. So I turned and walked away, my shoulders slumping with miserable rejection I hadn’t even heard spoken aloud. The scent of him lingered, bittersweet and unbearable. By the time I reached the pack house, tears blurred my vision.

I thought today might be different, that I could finally have someone to share it with. Instead, I was left with a heart full of despair. Weren't mates supposed to look after each other?

I hid inside the laundry room and started crying. Was there a way to get out of this pack? The idea of rejection was so painful. How would I serve him now?

I curled up on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees as tears streamed down my face. The ache in my chest felt unbearable. It was like a deep, raw wound that wouldn’t stop bleeding. I didn’t know what to do or who to go to for comfort.

Alpha Bram’s cold, distant stare replayed in my mind over and over. My mate. He didn’t even want to acknowledge me.

Suddenly, the door opened.

# Chapter 2

Auren POV

Being an orphan had always been hard for me. According to our previous Alpha, who was Alpha Bram’s father, my parents died in a pack war. He was kind enough to give me shelter in his packhouse and even allowed education in a school for omegas. However, a few years later when he died and Bram became the Alpha, he pulled me out of the school, made me pack’s servant and gave me lowly jobs, clearing stating that if I had to stay in the pack, I had to earn my living. His lusty gaze would often linger on me, and I would shy away, afraid of his intentions. But then he would snap his gaze away from me as if he saw vermin.

I was born with a tattoo the size of a squash ball on my back. A golden moon shackled by dark thorn vines curving around it. The Shaman had kindly warned me that it was a mark of a curse and so I had to keep it hidden at all times, afraid that if anyone saw it, they would kill me.

Suddenly, the door opened, snapping me from my thoughts. I hurriedly wiped my tears, but it was too late. Maris stood in the doorway, her arms crossed and a smug smile playing on her lips and her face donned with a wicked expression.

“Well, well,” she said, stepping closer. “If it isn’t our little orphan, sniveling like a child.”

I didn’t respond, keeping my head down. My whole body trembled in fear even though Siena wanted to come out and attack Maris.

“I know what happened,” she said, her voice dripping with venom. “You think you’re special because Bram is your mate? Let me tell you something, Auren.” She crouched down, her face close to mine. “We knew it long back. But you’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing. Bram doesn’t want you. He’ll reject you soon enough, and when he does, you’ll wish you’d never set foot in this pack.”

I swallowed hard, trying to fight back the fresh wave of tears.

“If you tell anyone—anyone—about this,” she continued, her voice low and dangerous, “I’ll make sure you regret it. Do you understand?”

I nodded weakly, too scared to speak. Maris straightened, brushing invisible dust off her skirt.

“Good. Now clean yourself up. You’re pathetic. I don’t want anyone to see you crying because if they do, they will ask you the reason. I swear you’ll regret it if they come to know the reason.” Saying that, she turned sharply, flicking her hair and marched out.

The weight of her words crushed me further. I brought my knees against my chest and hugged them tightly. Mates were supposed to take care of each other. His betrayal was worse than all my years of enduring servitude. And they knew that I was his mate? The revelation shocked me.

When I finally stepped out of the laundry room, the humiliation didn’t end. Reya was waiting for me in the kitchen. “You are reassigned to work in the toilets!” she barked at me. “Stay there until you get a new duty. Don’t you come out of that place!”

I balked as I stared at her. “What?” Toilets were the worst place to work.

She slapped me hard across my cheek. I screamed in pain as I fell down. Her lips curled into a sneer. “Did you not listen to what I said? Clean all the toilets. Now!”

Scared, I made my way to the toilets, sure that this was Maris’s order.

Over the next few days, Maris, always clever with her schemes, pointed fingers at me for things I hadn’t done. A broken vase, a spilled drink, and suddenly, I was everyone’s scapegoat. The other pack members whispered and sneered, their remarks cutting me like knives. They would accuse me of everything and anything. And Alpha Bram just turned a blind eye to all the bullying.

Things settled a bit, but one morning when I woke up and hurried to the kitchen, I heard Reya shouting at others. When I entered, Reya threw very expensive cutlery directly on the floor near me.

Maris walked in just at that time like she was waiting for this moment, as if on cue. “Reya, don’t let her get away with that,” she said, her tone filled with anger. “She’s nothing but trouble.”

It didn’t take much for Reya to agree. She and Maris cornered me by the pantry, their faces contorted in anger. I sensed something was wrong, but I had no time to react.

“You’ve caused enough problems,” Reya sneered immediately. “It’s time you learn a lesson.” And then came the blows. “No,” I cried and screamed and begged them to leave me, but no one came to rescue me.

“What’s going on?” A loud growl came. It was Alpha Bram, my mate. Was he coming to save me?

“Alpha Bram,” Maris immediately changed her facial expression and said in a honeyed voice. “Auren threw broken glass at me. See, I am bleeding.” She showed him a little cut on her finger that she got while beating me.

* The oldest side of the group suits dyed/lighter hair more and the youngest side with black/darker hair.
* I can't comprehend how Still My Lady is one of the more popular songs on the Burning Sensation album. It's one of the most forgettable songs and yet it's got its own MV and  it being the only bside to have a Chinese ver. Love Puzzle is the Still My Lady song of the Love Race album, at least Waruru gets its recognition. Justice for tell me what it is and Shut Up N' Lemme Go.
* I'm not into that many hiphop songs but 5K by Youngbin is really catchy. I still well prefer Bohemian though, i'm still mad that I only have its dance practice to stream.
* I wish FNC gave Jaeyoon more parts to shine. I'm gonna be honest, I didn't really notice him the first while I started listening to them, he's just not pushed in front enough and I thought the only times he really stood out to me was the Scream era.
* RPM Zero and Black Chaser had the blandest concept photos. Probably because they have the minimal amount of props and clothing wasn't that exciting. Turn Over had the best ones throughout all 3 versions. (did anyone notice they reused the clothing in the 'The Best, Dear Fantasy' album?)
* Shh, Scold and Love Puzzle are considered my 'so bad they're good' songs.
* Dawon has the best vocal tone for me in the group.
* Go back in Time and Midnight Road in the Mamma Mia album should've swapped with Just on my way and Let's Hang Out in the Knights of the sun album.
* Hwiyoung and Zuho sometimes gets the weirdest lines (but deep down they're some of  my favorite lines): ""They call me carpet,"" (HY - BIBORA) ""Become a real summer icon, adrenaline 오 마이써 mix a more 비틀거 림보 대가리로 racks on racks 이자 미리 받아 racks on racks AH!""

These are completely different people, different economic means, different genders, different ages and different sexualities. They do not know each other. I've known them for years, and recently, I finally got some time to spend with them for a coffee (individually I should add).



After some normal bits of conversation, each started completely disparaging (unprompted) entire masses of people, or cultures, or races as if it was normal to do so. When asked to elaborate, the usual bullet points of ""they do this"", ""they behave like that"", a literal ""they get money from the government""... All the points felt very ""I've read this on Instagram"". And I'm in disbelief. These are three different people, all bilingual, former or current immigrants themselves, some gay... It's just bizarre man... 



All of this has happened in the space of a month or so, they don't know each other and even though the focus of their hatred was different from one to the other, the vibe was very much the same. It really feels like social media has tainted them or something, or worse, made it normal enough to speak aloud these opinions, maybe?



How can you be in favour of taking liberties from someone and think at the same time that you will be unaffected? Blaming those without power for the politics of those in power is such a unintelligent thing to do...



At no point have I signalled that kind of behaviour is ok around me. I have a hatred of the power hungry verging on the unhealthy, that I try to keep for myself with them most of the time, but I guess I've never said ""don't be racist"". I thought that was not needed with them.

But the reality has reversed the scene. You are wearing glasses, or about to wear glasses, where you are the target, being spied on. That’s basically what smart glasses or vision-corrected sunglasses will do.



Before **Meta, Xiaomi, Google** were selling their smart glasses. DARPA and Israeli tech companies had long been busy developing this technology to give battlefield advantage. **DARPA** funded multiple projects like **Mind’s Eye, VACE, and FERET.** Their goal was to make helmets that would use AI to process live data and provide tactical advantage during combat.



[https://breakingdefense.com/2014/05/darpas-wearable-display-augments-reality-for-foot-troops](https://breakingdefense.com/2014/05/darpas-wearable-display-augments-reality-for-foot-troops)



**The Pitch**

From there, the mission expanded to integrate this tech into **Wearable**—helmets, phone cameras, or sunglasses. Yes, that is the reason why everyone is selling smart AI glasses now. **Like phones, this gadget will also reach the poor consumer level with cheaper prices**. More and more people will end up using it.



In fact, a campaign has already begun citing that aging will cause vision loss, and many of us will have myopia and other conditions. Moreover, You simply can’t deny the amount of screen time you and I both have—we need it more than ever. So a smart glass that protects vision and offers entertainment and safety at the same time is a win-win. Thousands of blind people have started to see with these glasses.

[https://archive.org/details/osf-registrations-teu6c-v1](https://archive.org/details/osf-registrations-teu6c-v1)

But before envisioning the future, I would like to walk back a few years. 

  
**The Threat**

**You see, I believe smart, AI-enabled glasses have been in circulation for a long time—used by spy agencies** to surveil you: where you go, who you meet, what you see. And that’s not all—but what you see as well.



What I am saying is that augmented reality–generating technology has been developed long ago. So it’s quite possible that you may start seeing dead people walking among you, or your wife cheating with someone else—caused by a brief glare while walking, or while in a car or bus. It might be an AI-generated glance. The person was someone else, but you thought it was your wife. Or you might testify against someone who is totally innocent.

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09285](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09285)

In late 2024, two **Harvard University students** built a demonstration system called **I‑XRAY** that combined Meta’s Ray‑Ban smart glasses with AI‑powered facial recognition to identify strangers in public and retrieve personal information about them from publicly available online sources. In their video demonstrations, the glasses streamed live footage to a computer that detected faces, then used AI and online search tools to find names, addresses, phone numbers, and even relatives’ names for people the students encountered on the street and on campus. Although the students did not release the code—citing safety concerns—the project highlighted how easily wearable cameras could be paired with AI to invade privacy by doxxing individuals without their consent.

[https://cybernews.com/gadgets/meta-smart-glasses-privacy-issues](https://cybernews.com/gadgets/meta-smart-glasses-privacy-issues)

This tech is not limited to sunglasses only, Lenses has also arrived in the scene.

**Isrxxl**

On the Israeli side, they are still in the race. In fact, they were far ahead before Google, Meta, or Xiaomi even thought of this. Elbit, OrCam, EyeControl, and others are still in the game—but Elbit is the only one that collaborated with DARPA. Lots of small startups caught on, or shall I say worked as the forefront. But the heist has already taken place before I myself and others can talk about it. And following incidents are the tell tale signs.



**Airport Detection**

These glasses—the spy ones—won’t be detected. If a device has no battery, no RF transmitter, and no bulk metal, airports cannot reliably detect it.

**Delta Airlines** in the US has already prohibited all its pilots and crew from using any kind of AI glasses. **Saudi Arabia** has the most cases, but only in Jeddah. Since recording is prohibited, all Meta AI glasses were confiscated. But it’s not only Saudi Arabia—**Morocco** as well.



Rumors spread that only Muslim countries are doing this, so let me debunk that. **MSC Cruise ships** have also cracked down on these glasses. You can keep them in your cabin, but no recording in public. Governments are not acknowledging it, but they are wary of it.



**Cheating on Exams**

Kids are using AI-integrated glasses to cheat on exams, forge papers, and more. I am sure other threats exist as well.

Only Allah knows what’s going on at **Shahjalal Airport.**



**Heart of the Matter**

So why am I ranting about AI-integrated glasses or these augmented reality–generating technologies?

I have no problem with someone using glasses for recording. People used vanity bags, James Bond briefcases, and pens to record videos or audio. Recording itself has nothing to do with this.

The real concern is that security protocol officers, witnesses of crimes, and even **you yourself might see an AI-generated reality instead of a real one**. It will drive you mad and make you paranoid.

If your sunglasses can generate a cyberpunk video right in front of your face, it can generate Hitler coming at you with an STG44 without breaking a sweat.

I know this doesn’t seem like a bad thing, but I want to maintain my current weight and rebuild some lost muscle mass. I’m throwing protein powder in my coffee and just came across a flavorless one I may try adding to everything, but I’m trying to thread the needle to beat the aches while staying strong. 

Has anyone navigated this successfully? 

(I am having it compounded. I have a normal BMI, but refuse to live my life with full body aches and fatigue and miss out on joy as a result. Am considering surgery down the line). ",2,1765654119.0,lipedema,0,1.0,False

(Saturday, Dec 20)","Join us for a one-day pilgrimage through the Dahme-Heideseen Nature Park, following the Way of Paul Gerhardt and the Pätzer Lakes. This route takes you along peaceful lakes, forest trails, and open landscapes, offering a quiet and scenic escape just outside Berlin.

📅 **Date & Time**

* Date: Saturday, 20 December 2025
*  Start: 9:33 am at Groß Köris Station (Travel via RE7 towards Senftenberg)
* Finish: approx. 2:30 pm at Bestensee Station (Return via RE7 towards Dessau)

🗺️ **Route & Highlights**

* Komoot tour: [https://www.komoot.com/tour/2612010806](https://www.komoot.com/tour/2612010806)
* Following the Paul-Gerhardt-Weg (Way of Paul Gerhardt)
* Forest paths, lakeside trails, and open nature in the Dahme-Heideseen Nature Park

**🤔 Why this hike?**

Pilgrimage is more than walking – it’s a conscious step out of daily routines into a slower, more mindful rhythm. We take time to pause, to connect with ourselves and with others, and to reflect on what truly matters in life. Along the way, there will also be a time of shared silence (about 30 minutes) as we walk together.

**🔔 What to know & bring**

* We walk at a steady, moderate pace, with breaks and care for one another.
* It’s winter, dress for the season and the weather. Important: hiking or running shoes, warm layered clothing, hat and gloves.
* Bring enough food and water for the whole day, as we won’t stop anywhere to buy snacks or drinks. A thermos with hot tea or coffee is highly recommended!
* Don’t forget your public transport ticket for the way there and back.
* Bring your pilgrim passport. There may be opportunities to collect stamps along the route.
* There may be an option for a quick winter dip. If you’d like to try it, bring swimwear, a towel and extra clothes to warm up afterwards.

I’m moving to New York to chase the elusive dream of acting, and naturally, I made a relocation chart to map my survival strategy. It includes neighborhoods, commute times, audition odds, rent nightmares, and my pizza-to-income ratio.

I’m posting it here because I need your advice, insights, or just a good roast. Will I thrive as an actor, or will I end up perfecting my “starving artist” routine in a tiny studio?

Take a look at my chart and tell me: is this a genius plan, a trainwreck waiting to happen, or just a really expensive hobby? Your input could save me from a lifetime of regret … or at least provide some good entertainment.",1,1765653928.0,AstrologyCharts,0,1.0,False

She's been very kind, positive, and supportive of me and really geld space for me emotionally like a therapist would.

It's been about 4 months I'm meeting her online and I've already seen so much betterment in myself. I mean, earlier I couldn't get myself out of bed, not leave my house for days, and would fall sick if someone would say something not in accordance with me. I was broke. Now, I can train to people and have gained the confidence to earn for myself. She really was there with me through all this journey. She was there when I didn't had enough money to buy a pack of milk to make some coffee for myself. 

All of this happened because she taught me how to connect to the deeper wisdom inside me and honestly, my spirit never felt so quenched in my life. I focus on praying and the practices she taught me helped me elevate my level of being.

But last week I faced some disagreement of thoughts with her. Since then, I decided to pause my classes with her and informed her about the same. She hasn't responded on it yet. 

But now, a part of me wonders if it was my fault. My brain, who earlier saw all the good things in her, now can't stop seeing things negatively. It's not like the negative thoughts didn't came earlier. They did. But I was aware that it's me ego of being super skeptical around people. It was hard to not fall for the pull of the ego but I managed to overcome it because I realised she was genuinely helping me.

But right now, I can't decide. I really don't know what to do. I get thoughts like is she a cult leader? I feel like I don't know her enough to decide. Also, I know my traumatised brain has a knack to feel comfortable and familiar with shady, manipulative, and covertly abusive people. 

But at the same time, she really taught me the most foundational practices that I felt working in my bones and that helped me turn my life around in matter of few months.

I don't know if it was just my blind faith of her or is she a genuine person. 

Also, in the last few days, when I introspected myself and asked myself what is it that's really stopping me from turning to her again, I realised I'M ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED OF TRUSTING PEOPLE. ABSOLUTELY.

My inner family system can't imagine opening those doors to ANYBODY. ANYONE. It says it feels safe to play small and to not have me grow in life because atleast I'll be alive that way.

I can sense that this is perhaps a fear, driven by an ego I carry from my childhood of surviving endless betrayal.

But if she's real and genuine, then I really don't want to let go of her. But I can't take down these walls. 

I don't know what to do.

I have been reading through this sub in an effort to identify the best machine to buy my husband for Christmas, but I don’t drink coffee at all and am a bit overwhelmed. He will likely only use it for Americanos and definitely has no interest in anything involving milk. Counter space is an issue so it’ll need to be compact, and my husband is not very high-maintenance and will be happy with something simple so I don’t want to spend more than I need to. Max budget is $300 and ideally I’d aim for $200 or less, but I’d rather buy nice than buy twice.

1pltkon,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1pltkon/a_really_small_moment_today_ended_up_making_my/,A really small moment today ended up making my whole day way better than I expected,"This morning started off pretty meh, not awful, just one of those days where everything feels slightly off and heavy for no clear reason. I was tired, running a little late, already annoyed at myself, doing everything on autopilot and thinking about a million small things at once. I stopped to grab a coffee on the way out and the place was busy and quiet in that awkward morning way, everyone staring at their phones, no one really there yet. When it was my turn the barista smiled and said something like “hey, you look like you could use an extra good one today” and then wrote a tiny smiley on the cup. It wasnt deep or special or anything, just unexpected enough to snap me out of my head for a second.

What surprised me is how much that tiny interaction stuck with me for the rest of the day. I thought about it again while walking, then again at work hours later, like wow, that was literally it and yet it shifted my mood. The coffee itself wasnt even amazing, but I drank it slower, actually tasted it, instead of just rushing through like I usually do. I noticed I was a little more patient too, less irritated by small stuff, letting things slide that normally wouldve bothered me. It’s weird how something that probably took that person two seconds and zero thought ended up echoing all day in my brain.

I guess it reminded me how much these small moments matter even if we pretend they dont. We focus so much on big wins or big problems that we forget how powerful random kindness or simple noticing can be. A smile, a sentence, someone treating you like a human instead of background noise. It sounds cheesy writing it out, I know, but it genuinely made my day lighter. Now I keep thinking how often we could do that for someone else without even realizing it.",2,1765653607.0,CasualConversation,1,1.0,False
1pltk94,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pltk94/guy_25m_i_27f_dated_for_15_months_rings_past/,"Guy (25m) I (27f) dated for 1.5 months rings past midnight after no contact, what does it mean?","Hello, I have found myself in a confusing situation with a guy I dated for 1.5 months. Full context below, but essentially he cut things off due to differences in our life-styles and having a connection with someone else at the same time. After about a month of no-contact he has since texted and then rang me past midnight. I still miss him and the connection we had so feel open to reconnecting and exploring things if circumstances have changed. However without knowing if this is the case, I am unsure if this is a possibility from the info I have, and would welcome thoughts and advice on how to move forwards with this. 

Context: I met this guy at a party, he’s not necessarily the kind of person I would usually go for (usually I meet people who are involved in the same communities I’m in) but we clicked instantly and he asked for my number. 

At the time I was dating a couple of people (who were polyamorous) he was aware of this. I was unsure exactly what I wanted to long-term but was open to trying polyamory to see how I felt after having been in long-term monogamous relationships the majority of my adult life. He disclosed to me that he had also recently started dating another person (very early in the dating stage, he basically started talking to us both at the same time). 

Through conversations with him alongside generally reflecting on my own, I came to realise that while I was glad I had tried things and had no regrets, ultimately long term what I want is monogamy (which is also what he stated we was searching for long term also). I would have come to this realisation regardless of starting to date him, I believe seeing him simply made things clearer and sped up the process. 

After realising this I ended up breaking it off with the other people I was seeing, explaining that I had realised ultimately monogamy was what I needed long term and also respecting that for them polyamory was very important, so it was all left in good terms. 

I let him know this had happened just so he knew where I was at. He was very sweet and actually offered to be there if I needed comfort. He was also honest disclosing that he was still seeing this other girl, and feeling slight guilt as he had never been in the position of actively dating multiple people at once (having not dated much generally) before and I think me having been dating others in some way took some of that pressure and guilt off him. However at this point we had been talking and seeing each other for less than two full weeks, so again it was very early days so I told him I wasn’t expecting him to suddenly have to cut things off and make a decision, we were still getting to know each other and exploring what things could be and where they could go. 

With time passing we started spending a lot of time together, sometimes hanging out 3 times a week when in the same city (I travel a lot for work) and chatting pretty much daily. He was incredibly sweet, remembering things I shared with him, cooking for me and looking after me, enjoying shared interests together, taking me out and paying for everything etc, I haven't had a guy treat me like this make me feel so held in a really long time. One day we spent the whole day/night together as I had organised a surprise for his birthday as he had shared with me that he doesn’t usually celebrate due to struggling to organise things for himself, and i wanted to treat him. It really was a lovely day and it felt again like we were very connected and it was moving forwards. 

On that night we ended up having a conversation about the fact I was going to be going away soon to visit family abroad for 3 weeks. I was feeling a little anxious about it in terms of our situation. I communicated feeling worried that me being away would mean our connection could fade away and what our communication would be like during that time. He was very caring in his response but also honest in terms of acknowledging he couldn’t know how it would feel us having so much time apart so early on while he also had this other connection he was exploring; saying yeah maybe the other connection could then become stronger, or the time could make him realise how much he missed me and wanting to focus on us. Obviously in some ways not what you want to hear but I appreciated the honesty. 

That night we also talked about whether or not I was seeing anyone else, I told him I wasn’t explaining I had just gotten myself out of a situation where I was seeing multiple people and how towards the end I found that stressful and also had been very busy and travelling the last month or so (this was all true but also, I wasn’t actively looking to date other people because I did like him and felt invested, however I was afraid to be too vulnerable and did not want that to create weird pressure). I also learnt that night that the other woman he was seeing was still sleeping with other people but he didn’t think dating other people. 

A couple of weeks went by after that and we continued seeing and talking to each other, with things feeling increasingly serious. It reached the point where it was getting harder to feel comfortable with him seeing other people with how our relationship was going, so I decided I had to bite the bullet and be honest with him. I told him that it wasn’t an ultimatum where he had to make a decision there and then, but that I wanted to be honest, that I did really like him, and that it was beginning to feel uncomfortable him seeing two of us (as we weren’t in a polyamorous setting) and that it was making it harder to feel excited and lean into what we had. So that I wanted him to take the time he needed to make sure he knew what he wanted (trying to trust that if we were meant to be we will be) and I wanted him to explore whatever he needed to be sure and also stay in touch while I was away and then re-exploring things when I got back, but that it couldn’t go on much longer after that. He listened and seemed to understand and again was very sweet and thanked me for being honest and vulnerable with him. 

About two days before I was meant to leave we had plans to spend the day together. It was really lovely, he brought over food and we went for coffee and chatted and then came back and cuddled while we watched tv. Then just before he had to go to work (around 8pm) he asked to talk to me about something. He ended up saying he had been thinking and feeling like he had to make a decision before I went away, and essentially ended up cutting things off. He cited the reason as both of us being in some ways quite different people (think in terms of culture and value systems). This is something we had discussed very early on, with initially it being me having hesitations (as I said at the start he is not someone I would have usually gone for, but we got got along so well that I decided to be open and give it a chance). I had also raised it with him since then, asking how he felt about it and if it bothered him, he had said no, that there were questions about how we would navigate certain things such as hypothetically how we would raise kids etc, but both of us saying we felt open to exploring it. The whole thing felt very emotional, and he ended up crying. Saying this really felt like a break-up not just cutting something casual off, and how much he cared about me and would miss me, it honestly took me aback seeing him like that. We spent about an hour talking and both crying before he had to leave. He said he still really wanted to have me in his life and would love to still spend time together even if how we spent that time would have to change. I was honest that I did not think I wanted, what we had was never a friendship and given the context it felt difficult and honestly just not what I wanted. I asked him if he felt relieved having made a decision (imagining that dating two people you really like knowing you have to soon make a decision one way or the other would also be difficult in some ways). He said he didn’t feel relieved in that moment, just really sad and also stated things with the other person may not even work etc. 

He offered to chat or meet the next day (the day I was leaving) if I wanted to, I told him I did not want to meet up and needed space but would reach out if there was anything I needed to discuss. The next day he reached out checking in. I had realised I felt frustrated about his decision in regards to him having never flagged his concerns despite me raising it myself, and having never had a discussion with me about it. I didn’t raise it with the hoped it would change his mind, but because in the past I have bottled things and I needed to express it just for myself. He initially had really framed things as being worried about what he could offer me not being enough etc etc and being worried about me compromising my lifestyle in some way because of him. I made it clear that I know myself and what I stand for and would not compromise things I didn’t feel okay with for him or anyone else. That I had been open with him and wanted to have those discussions with him because I’m also not two dimensional and the things I want in life sometimes do conflict and there is room for compromise which we had talked about, and that the way he painted it with this coming from me didn’t sit right with me. He ended up acknowledging the pressure didn’t come from me but from him, and worrying what he could offer me in this regard wasn’t enough. That it had never been a problem while we were together, but because of the situation of him having to make a decision he started worrying it could present challenges in the future, despite the fact that if this other person wasn’t in the picture it probably wouldn’t even be a consideration for him, at least at this stage. He apologised and said he was sorry we didn’t get to explore more what this could be. 

After that I did not reply, as I felt I had said everything I needed to at that stage. I went away for 3 weeks then to visit my family, during this time we had no contact and while I missed him and sometimes wondered if we could re-connect if circumstances changed, I had no intention of reaching out or chasing him. Under a week after I was back I received a text from him, it said something along the lines of ‘Hey’ I don’t know if you’re back yet, but if you are I would love to meet up and hear about your trip! Maybe go for a coffee? I understand if you don’t want to see me, but I thought I would put the offer out there’. When I got the text it felt nice to know he had not completely forgotten about me, but I also reminded myself how he wanted to be friends, and how I did not think this was something that would be positive for me. He made the decision to pursue another connection over ours which he had every right to do, but to me this also meant he now doesn’t get to keep me around. I was unsure whether to reply or not. Part of me wanted to just because I missed him and was curious, but because of everything I have just explained it did not feel wise and I was also working on a big legal case meaning I was absolutely swamped and it felt like the last thing I needed to add on top, so I decided to leave it, at least for then. 

Another week went by and one night I am listening to a podcast as I fall asleep. Suddenly the podcast stopped playing (I’m half asleep at this point), I assume maybe it’s buffering, but after a few seconds still nothing. I decide to look at my phone screen to see what is going on, when I see his name as the phone shows him ringing. At this point it’s past midnight, and it rang the whole way through. I was really surprised and unsure what to do, I decided not to pick up because as I was unprepared and anxious to have any conversation at that time with him not knowing what he wanted. The next morning I woke up to no messages, nothing saying ’sorry I didn’t meant to ring’ (which I would say if I accidentally rang someone) but also nothing explaining why he rang or stating what he wanted to talk about. Honestly it has really thrown me, before that I felt happy leaving things, but since then I have not been able to stop questioning why he rung and whether to contact him or not. 

The way I’ve been feeling is the door between us is shut, but maybe not entirely locked (with a part of me really wanting to try again if the circumstances have changed because I did really like and value the connection we had, I haven't felt this way for someone in a long time). But also not wanting this to hold me back and just waiting around for him if nothing has changed (which he hasn’t stated has). Before he called I felt like just leaving things and ignoring the text, but the phone call has thrown me. I guess wondering why he called at that time (I would personally not randomly ring someone I had dated wanting to be friends at that time just to be friends) but maybe I am reading into it too much because of my own feelings. 

I know the most solid advice is almost always to just lock the door and move on, don’t reply. And while I logically know this is probably the most sound advice… I am curious as to what others think the call could mean (I’ve received varying opinions from friends), if there is a chance he is open to reconnecting, and if I wanted to explore the possibility of trying again (which I do) what would be the most strategic move?

1pltj4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakupBackup/comments/1pltj4o/guy_25m_i_27f_dated_for_15_months_rings_past/,"Guy (25m) I (27f) dated for 1.5 months rings past midnight after no contact, what does this mean?","Hello, I have found myself in a confusing situation with a guy I dated for 1.5 months. Full context below, but essentially he cut things off due to differences in our life-styles and having a connection with someone else at the same time. After about a month of no-contact he has since texted and then rang me past midnight. I still miss him and the connection we had so feel open to reconnecting and exploring things if circumstances have changed. However without knowing if this is the case, I am unsure if this is a possibility from the info I have, and would welcome thoughts and advice on how to move forwards with this. 

Context: I met this guy at a party, he’s not necessarily the kind of person I would usually go for (usually I meet people who are involved in the same communities I’m in) but we clicked instantly and he asked for my number. 

At the time I was dating a couple of people (who were polyamorous) he was aware of this. I was unsure exactly what I wanted to long-term but was open to trying polyamory to see how I felt after having been in long-term monogamous relationships the majority of my adult life. He disclosed to me that he had also recently started dating another person (very early in the dating stage, he basically started talking to us both at the same time). 

Through conversations with him alongside generally reflecting on my own, I came to realise that while I was glad I had tried things and had no regrets, ultimately long term what I want is monogamy (which is also what he stated we was searching for long term also). I would have come to this realisation regardless of starting to date him, I believe seeing him simply made things clearer and sped up the process. 

After realising this I ended up breaking it off with the other people I was seeing, explaining that I had realised ultimately monogamy was what I needed long term and also respecting that for them polyamory was very important, so it was all left in good terms. 

I let him know this had happened just so he knew where I was at. He was very sweet and actually offered to be there if I needed comfort. He was also honest disclosing that he was still seeing this other girl, and feeling slight guilt as he had never been in the position of actively dating multiple people at once (having not dated much generally) before and I think me having been dating others in some way took some of that pressure and guilt off him. However at this point we had been talking and seeing each other for less than two full weeks, so again it was very early days so I told him I wasn’t expecting him to suddenly have to cut things off and make a decision, we were still getting to know each other and exploring what things could be and where they could go. 

With time passing we started spending a lot of time together, sometimes hanging out 3 times a week when in the same city (I travel a lot for work) and chatting pretty much daily. He was incredibly sweet, remembering things I shared with him, cooking for me and looking after me, enjoying shared interests together, taking me out and paying for everything etc, I haven't had a guy treat me like this make me feel so held in a really long time. One day we spent the whole day/night together as I had organised a surprise for his birthday as he had shared with me that he doesn’t usually celebrate due to struggling to organise things for himself, and i wanted to treat him. It really was a lovely day and it felt again like we were very connected and it was moving forwards. 

On that night we ended up having a conversation about the fact I was going to be going away soon to visit family abroad for 3 weeks. I was feeling a little anxious about it in terms of our situation. I communicated feeling worried that me being away would mean our connection could fade away and what our communication would be like during that time. He was very caring in his response but also honest in terms of acknowledging he couldn’t know how it would feel us having so much time apart so early on while he also had this other connection he was exploring; saying yeah maybe the other connection could then become stronger, or the time could make him realise how much he missed me and wanting to focus on us. Obviously in some ways not what you want to hear but I appreciated the honesty. 

That night we also talked about whether or not I was seeing anyone else, I told him I wasn’t explaining I had just gotten myself out of a situation where I was seeing multiple people and how towards the end I found that stressful and also had been very busy and travelling the last month or so (this was all true but also, I wasn’t actively looking to date other people because I did like him and felt invested, however I was afraid to be too vulnerable and did not want that to create weird pressure). I also learnt that night that the other woman he was seeing was still sleeping with other people but he didn’t think dating other people. 

A couple of weeks went by after that and we continued seeing and talking to each other, with things feeling increasingly serious. It reached the point where it was getting harder to feel comfortable with him seeing other people with how our relationship was going, so I decided I had to bite the bullet and be honest with him. I told him that it wasn’t an ultimatum where he had to make a decision there and then, but that I wanted to be honest, that I did really like him, and that it was beginning to feel uncomfortable him seeing two of us (as we weren’t in a polyamorous setting) and that it was making it harder to feel excited and lean into what we had. So that I wanted him to take the time he needed to make sure he knew what he wanted (trying to trust that if we were meant to be we will be) and I wanted him to explore whatever he needed to be sure and also stay in touch while I was away and then re-exploring things when I got back, but that it couldn’t go on much longer after that. He listened and seemed to understand and again was very sweet and thanked me for being honest and vulnerable with him. 

About two days before I was meant to leave we had plans to spend the day together. It was really lovely, he brought over food and we went for coffee and chatted and then came back and cuddled while we watched tv. Then just before he had to go to work (around 8pm) he asked to talk to me about something. He ended up saying he had been thinking and feeling like he had to make a decision before I went away, and essentially ended up cutting things off. He cited the reason as both of us being in some ways quite different people (think in terms of culture and value systems). This is something we had discussed very early on, with initially it being me having hesitations (as I said at the start he is not someone I would have usually gone for, but we got got along so well that I decided to be open and give it a chance). I had also raised it with him since then, asking how he felt about it and if it bothered him, he had said no, that there were questions about how we would navigate certain things such as hypothetically how we would raise kids etc, but both of us saying we felt open to exploring it. The whole thing felt very emotional, and he ended up crying. Saying this really felt like a break-up not just cutting something casual off, and how much he cared about me and would miss me, it honestly took me aback seeing him like that. We spent about an hour talking and both crying before he had to leave. He said he still really wanted to have me in his life and would love to still spend time together even if how we spent that time would have to change. I was honest that I did not think I wanted, what we had was never a friendship and given the context it felt difficult and honestly just not what I wanted. I asked him if he felt relieved having made a decision (imagining that dating two people you really like knowing you have to soon make a decision one way or the other would also be difficult in some ways). He said he didn’t feel relieved in that moment, just really sad and also stated things with the other person may not even work etc. 

He offered to chat or meet the next day (the day I was leaving) if I wanted to, I told him I did not want to meet up and needed space but would reach out if there was anything I needed to discuss. The next day he reached out checking in. I had realised I felt frustrated about his decision in regards to him having never flagged his concerns despite me raising it myself, and having never had a discussion with me about it. I didn’t raise it with the hoped it would change his mind, but because in the past I have bottled things and I needed to express it just for myself. He initially had really framed things as being worried about what he could offer me not being enough etc etc and being worried about me compromising my lifestyle in some way because of him. I made it clear that I know myself and what I stand for and would not compromise things I didn’t feel okay with for him or anyone else. That I had been open with him and wanted to have those discussions with him because I’m also not two dimensional and the things I want in life sometimes do conflict and there is room for compromise which we had talked about, and that the way he painted it with this coming from me didn’t sit right with me. He ended up acknowledging the pressure didn’t come from me but from him, and worrying what he could offer me in this regard wasn’t enough. That it had never been a problem while we were together, but because of the situation of him having to make a decision he started worrying it could present challenges in the future, despite the fact that if this other person wasn’t in the picture it probably wouldn’t even be a consideration for him, at least at this stage. He apologised and said he was sorry we didn’t get to explore more what this could be. 

After that I did not reply, as I felt I had said everything I needed to at that stage. I went away for 3 weeks then to visit my family, during this time we had no contact and while I missed him and sometimes wondered if we could re-connect if circumstances changed, I had no intention of reaching out or chasing him. Under a week after I was back I received a text from him, it said something along the lines of ‘Hey’ I don’t know if you’re back yet, but if you are I would love to meet up and hear about your trip! Maybe go for a coffee? I understand if you don’t want to see me, but I thought I would put the offer out there’. When I got the text it felt nice to know he had not completely forgotten about me, but I also reminded myself how he wanted to be friends, and how I did not think this was something that would be positive for me. He made the decision to pursue another connection over ours which he had every right to do, but to me this also meant he now doesn’t get to keep me around. I was unsure whether to reply or not. Part of me wanted to just because I missed him and was curious, but because of everything I have just explained it did not feel wise and I was also working on a big legal case meaning I was absolutely swamped and it felt like the last thing I needed to add on top, so I decided to leave it, at least for then. 

Another week went by and one night I am listening to a podcast as I fall asleep. Suddenly the podcast stopped playing (I’m half asleep at this point), I assume maybe it’s buffering, but after a few seconds still nothing. I decide to look at my phone screen to see what is going on, when I see his name as the phone shows him ringing. At this point it’s past midnight, and it rang the whole way through. I was really surprised and unsure what to do, I decided not to pick up because as I was unprepared and anxious to have any conversation at that time with him not knowing what he wanted. The next morning I woke up to no messages, nothing saying ’sorry I didn’t meant to ring’ (which I would say if I accidentally rang someone) but also nothing explaining why he rang or stating what he wanted to talk about. Honestly it has really thrown me, before that I felt happy leaving things, but since then I have not been able to stop questioning why he rung and whether to contact him or not. 

The way I’ve been feeling is the door between us is shut, but maybe not entirely locked (with a part of me really wanting to try again if the circumstances have changed because I did really like and value the connection we had, I haven't felt this way for someone in a long time). But also not wanting this to hold me back and just waiting around for him if nothing has changed (which he hasn’t stated has). Before he called I felt like just leaving things and ignoring the text, but the phone call has thrown me. I guess wondering why he called at that time (I would personally not randomly ring someone I had dated wanting to be friends at that time just to be friends) but maybe I am reading into it too much because of my own feelings. 

I know the most solid advice is almost always to just lock the door and move on, don’t reply. And while I logically know this is probably the most sound advice… I am curious as to what others think the call could mean (I’ve received varying opinions from friends), if there is a chance he is open to reconnecting, and if I wanted to explore the possibility of trying again (which I do) what would be the most strategic move?

1pltgmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pac12/comments/1pltgmk/canzano_pac12_looked_at_everything_and_anything/,Canzano: Pac-12 looked at 'everything and anything',"""Pac-12 Conference Commissioner Teresa Gould is fresh off three days spent in Las Vegas at a convention that featured the top sports business minds sucking in second-hand smoke while talking about college athletics.

Utah is signing on for a $500 million private-equity deal.

The Big 12 is finalizing an agreement that would add hundreds of millions in private capital.

Is the Pac-12 about to leap into that space?

I tracked Gould down before her Saturday morning coffee.

The private capital path is different. It’s essentially a low-cost loan. That’s the basis of the deal the Big 12 is finalizing for its members. If schools opt in, they’ll get an infusion of up-front cash borrowed against future distributions from the conference.

“Getting debt is not hard to do,” she told me. “What we’ve been thinking and talking about is not the quick economic return, but what kind of commercial partners bring expertise and acumen to what we’re doing.”

Keep in mind, the Pac-12 already has established an outside entity — Pac-12 Enterprises. It’s a for-profit endeavor. All the commercial efforts run through that arm of the business, and when I talk with presidents, I get the sense that the conference has a sneaky-big vision for what it will blossom into. ""

Eat whole food only. Meat and veg and potatoes. As per my endocrinologist if it comes out of a box or a package don’t eat it. 

If I want pasta he said make it myself. Rice is okay from a package but brown is preferred. 

Bread? Make it at home. I said the flour is processed but he said that’s okay and use whole grain flour. 

I did a few weeks just protein and veggies and some rice. I lost weight. 

Then I fell off the wagon and had pizza and cold cuts and processed foods and felt like crap plus I gained back what I’d lost. 

It’s a roller coaster.

Definitely.

Is this a good way of decluttering a house? Is there a better method? Anyone have tips of unhoarding a house? It’s not really hoard more so just clutter. But we both agree we need to get rid of stuff.

Zane followed a Nest security officer through the work corridor.

They didn't exchange any apologies or small talk after they'd barged in on him showering.

The only thing he'd heard from the guy was ""You're going to follow me and not speak at all"" in a tone that either meant Zane was in serious trouble or the guy was having a power trip. And he couldn't say which.

Though he did manage to pick up a half box of bagels and whole rotisserie chicken in the break room on the way down.

Between the trip behind the mech bays along the corridor, and waiting for others to pass by, Zane had finished the chicken and half the bagels. He'd traded the rest for a coffee from Cade.

One of the top ten pilots!

He'd nearly stumbled from the luke warm liquid burning down his neck but he should have expected that from the pilot he got it from. Cade always needed a certain something to sit around in the hangar without a mission or match oncoming.

Unfortunately his 'liquid calm' didn't work so well on other pilots, Zane included. 

It meant he was a bit light headed when the security officer arrived at the machine Zane assumed he was piloting today, and what a machine it was.

Painted in an unmistakable Cherry red with visible layer of clear coat on top. Deep blood red and almost matte, diagonal striped designs made a corporate livery ontop. Black outlines, amber shapes and white lettering for the utility markings were stamped through the coatings all over the thin, blocky plating.

The only curves on the mech were one dimensional or simple domes, the sacrificial plates on the leading edges were all slightly inset and coated the same carbon black as the exposed internals. Crash brackets around the joints in the armor were done in a bright white under the same clear coat as the body.

There was no mistaking the 'Ark Promotional' that screamed from every surface of the machine. But its shape screamed louder.

From its legs being twice as wide front to back than by the sides, its narrow chest with big inlet scoops, every limb bulging with the shapes and struts of heavy actuators under their light armor. This was a machine meant for speed.

But not the dainty speed of other manufacturers with their honeycomb plates and compound curves. This was Ark, the shipbuilders, the iron hammer of Fleet Command, the mech makers. They did not make something with weak points, they did not add superfluous plating.

They did not rely on mana and magic.

Armor was doled out like wax dripped onto an action figure on its back, thick up front with overhangs around the sides. Vents cut like gills around places where they were needed, often widened at one end or the other for a port or outlet.

Its hand mounts held a mortar launcher and Mech scale SMG, its arms thickly built to support them. Over its shoulders were a 4-pack of heavy missile tubes and a 6 inch punt gun that sat folded in half around its loading system, breach exposed to the open air.

Whatever the security officer was saying as he lead Zane around to the machine's feet sailed right by as its lights flickered and gradually turned on. Shining a deep, broad blue that seemed to pierce past his vision.

Each one was an indicator or sensor of some sort and when the machine ran its self checks steam fired from nozzles nestled in the same gaps.

""Oh, water cooling. My reputation proceeds me."" Zane muttered to himself before being rudely broken out of his revery by his escort.

""HAVE YOU BEEN LISTENING TO ANYTHING I JUST TOLD YOU?"" The officer didn't wait for an answer and immediately launched into a tirade about getting distracted. Shortly followed by another around discipline, self awareness and behavior. 

Each one seemed to ignite yet another rant in his general direction.

Zane was pretty sure the officer was talking about all the stuff around the mech, its role, its builder, what he was going to do with it, why.

All of which seemed easy to just infer. It's an Ark model made to showcase a new part or series of parts. It's pretty obviously a hunter killer relying on a good pilot or distractions to use its shoulder cannon.

Big missile do not but strike a single foe after all. Though may only need to strike once.

As for his role in piloting it? 'Here's a shitty pilot who explodes everything he touches, watch him fail to explode our fancy new halo model.'

""YOU'RE STILL NOT LISTENING!?!"" The exasperated howl of the officer broke through his thoughts.

""What? What do you want a five page essay?"" he nearly shouted back,

""You've been moping around the garage and hovering over Tough Break for 2 WHOLE FUCKING DAYS, I'd expect you to have some listening skills after your mechanics got done with you at least!""

""Well believe it or not I care about what they're saying, but you go and walk a pilot past a fucking candy painted HOT ROD and expect the pilot to LISTEN?!""

Thus began a screaming match between a disgraced pilot and cooped up security guard. Either could be former military or law enforcement but neither was, all they had were kids shows and evening dramas to tell them how these sorts of clashes go.

The recovery officer who was still dealing with Zane's case looked out of her office to see the commotion.

A very unfortunate steel tube chair creaked under her grasp before sailing at hither to unexperienced speeds.

It was a very eventful day for that chair.

\---

I am soaked.

I was right about the tarp, apparently all the electronics were good. I took my a brief little nap while the technicians unsoldered all the chips or did whatever to verify the boards worked. Everything game up daisies and I got my money.

I kept more of it this time. Mostly because solder, wicks, irons and assorted odds and ends for fixing cables are not worth the literal piles of cash that the boards and chips are. It's high end stuff according to the guys there.

Most of it came out of absolutely wrecked mechs, crushed up chassis that only barely kept the pilot's capsule intact. Stuff I was looking through to fix up Bunny-ears with, or cross reference for Red-1 and 2.

Eventually the computer place pointed me to a bike repair place at what was apparently around 7pm local time.

Commuting there took all of two minutes as I crossed the street and walked into the store just down the road. Didn't even bother starting the motor the commute it was that short.

Those bike repairs, checks, tire swaps and a top up on the premix would take at least a day once they got to it, so I have something like 2 days.

I cant remember if I flipped them a pile of ones or twenties but I was back out on the road with my square little package on my back one bill stack lighter with a vague memory of telling them to get creative with it. 

Instead of square because of circuit boards it was now square because of a cardboard box.

From there I walked the streets like a woman on a mission, and my mission was bread. Well ideally steak, but bread is what I knew best.

I knew where it was, where I was and was subtracting the displacement one step at a time. But the missile is eepy, it be an eeby deeby and damn near walked by before remembering to check the storefront.

I check and I stumble back toward the door to walk into the store, completely soaked.

The world was wobbly in ways it didn't need to be and as I found a timber bench to curl up on. Then something weird happened, my vision did the shimmery thing.

Suddenly I went from completely soaked to barely damp, the cold shivers I'd been fending off vanished and I went from dead tired to sleepy drunk.

Sitting on the bench like a normal person and sorting through all my inventory of stuff had me wishing I knew how to sew. My ratchet strap fanny pack was looking very disheveled.

Not that I trusted myself to do anything about it, just that it was.

Eventually my wobbling back and forth between sleepy and drunk was interrupted by Fiadh, I notice her walking over and quirk a brow...I think.

""They gotty u work opywings *ann* nits?"" I may just be running on adrenalin, I sounded bad even to me.

She paused, then asked ""You planning on sleeping in an alley again or are you here for bread?""

""Am here fir bead, how long since shopping tip?"" I was probably in the canal a little too long.

She sat down next to me and started checking things on my wrist and neck, ""That was yesterday morning, did you get any sleep?""

And I worked all of both days, slept like 5 hours and poked so many big wires.

""Was bushy."" I stated in my own defense.

""Uh huh, jus' plan'n on crashing here 'uh?"" She asked as she put a hand on my forehead and shined a little keychain light into places, like my eyes or mouth.

""N-uh, wan food 'for bed. Any hotels?"" I rest myself back against the wall as I ask.

""Nope, you're coming home with me. I don't trust an-"" the rest got really fuzzy and the next thing I knew we were walking along the street under an umbrella.

I felt half asleep and weightless, practically floating along as little lines of light shot out from me and splashed against every little corner and window along the road. Filling in the world where my vision wouldn't, like painting the buildings around us with something I could see even through walls.

Like those games where your mini map is just the level geometry that you can whip the camera all around.

We got to the familiar covered stairs and she had to tug pretty hard to get me to steer onto the stairs. Everything after that was blank.

The next thing that happened was me waking up to the smell of bacon, laying sprawled out, face down on a bed, some pillows and blankets under my belly so my chest weren't squished.

Amber light streamed in through the windows and birds sang outside...at least under the noise of some trash trucks, a traffic jam overhead and the booms of a mech fight happening...someplace.

When I pushed myself up I noticed two things, almost all my clothes are someplace else...scratch that, *all* my clothes are someplace else and my arms and legs had a lot more damage than I was feeling.

Little grey ovals and cracking stripes littered my body, each one smelled like burnt hair and bad meat. Beneath all that were my sore muscles and aching bones, though the bones felt more rumbly than anything else.

Someone had grabbed new clothes for me and looking at them had a question in my head. Looking around the room had another.

""Fiadh, did you just so happen to have clothes my size or did we do more than just walk here last night?"" I asked, rather worried about what I couldn't remember.

""You overtaxed your mana again, we got some food in you, cleaned up a few scrapes and walked home. Those are my clothes from middle school, they looked like they'd be a good fit."" She called back from the kitchen, where sizzling sounds and breakfast smells were coming from.

I sat on my knees just processing for a bit.

""Are you saying my tits are small?"" I asked with some small outrage,

Her giggling at the question didn't help, ""You're fine hon, I wish mine stayed that size sometimes.""

Grumbling and backing myself off the bed I sorted through a pile of clothes set out on a decorative bench, mostly cargo pants that were a little short for me and flannels that felt very roomy.

I slipped on a set of grey cammo pants, rolling them up to my knees and grabbed a big orange flannel to wrap myself up in as I walked out to the kitchen.

She paused her cooking to look me over and smile, wearing fluffy pants and weatherbeaten dress shirt herself. Seems the 'shirt too big' trend is strong with our kind of people, the sleeves on mine run past my fingertips as I rub my eyes.

""Breakfast?"" I ask, she nods and stirs the pan a bit, shuffling around strips of bacon before responding.

""You can take your glorious bead head over to the table where I laid out your stuff and a few actual bags for you to use.""

I nodded and turned before pausing. ""You should ask people before you take their clothes off."" I mock accused her, sparking a laugh.

""You should have seen yourself, as soon as you were through that door your had absolutely no modestly, falling all over me and asking how we were going to manage 'sheet provisioning'"" 

I cringed a bit as she continued,

""Honestly not the worst pickup attempt but I was more preoccupied with getting you actually clean, you looked like your hair hadn't seen soap in five days!"" She laughed and it made me pout a bit.

Feeling a lot more like a moody teenager than a grown ass woman as I walk my way over to the table. I was absolutely not looking forward to that time of month...though magic might just...nope.

Time and place, time and place.

Anyways, my stuff: Many many bundles of bills, the tarp and net both folded up small, the ratchet strap rolled up into a sausage next to them, my gun and the 6 extra magazines had stowed in my pants were all laid out on the table.

Then there were the tools. Inside several plastic latching boxes there were solder, parts, fuse, connector and wiring kits, with extra zip ties. Note pads, pencils, pens, chapstick, vassaline (good for fixing burns) and other assorted gadgets sat loose next to that stuff.

Some backpacks and duffle bags here arranged on the wall next to the table for my perusal too, all assumedly second hand.

And with a notable lack of pocket knife. With my day wear not assembled yet I just shuffled stuff around on the table.

""Know any good brands for utility or folding knives?"" I asked back in the direction of the kitchen.

""Woman you are in the market for a K-tool."" Fiadh replied back.

I was about to reply back with a good ol' 'am not' when I spotted my reflection in the mirror. ALL my hair was glued into a mohawk by my bed head, in all its spectrum of colors.

It looked like someone threw salts and copper stuff into a fire and took colors as the inspiration for their hairdo.

Not a half bad look.

Eventually, combing my fingers through it and smoothing things out i get it all sitting mostly flat, mostly on top of my head.

""So you stripped me naked, gave me a bath, lent me your teenage underwear and shared a bed with me, all without knowing my name?"" I asked Fiadh

She'd brought around several plates of food and settled down so into a seat facing the kitchen, ""Basically, I've always had a nose about me for good people and bad, and you don't smell like a bad people.""

""No I think what you're smelling there are flashbacks to your younger years, hell I even fit in your old clothes."" I give a tug to a braw strap for emphasis. She chuckles and turns on an old (by my perspective) tube TV sitting on the kitchen counter facing the table

I munch chunk after thick cut chunk of bacon and potato pancake as she turns the channel to an ongoing fight. A bunch of tanks all blasting at each other in a colossal colosseum.

Theres big score banners, announcers and a running ticker on the bottom giving a play by play. They all kinda crowd the view of the actual battle happening.

""What's this?"" I give a point to the screen as Fiadh glances my way.

She raises an eyebrow before answering, ""You from a different ship or something? This is the channel dedicated to Nest broadcasts. They run an arena organization letting Pilots corporate security squads duke it out with each other to show off their parts or skills for any interested buyers.""

""I got hit by a bus, my memory might not be the best."" I mutter back.

She however looked shocked, ""What do you mean hit by a bus!""

""I mean what I said! I'm walking out of a store, joshing with the cashier, then WAM. Bus."" I emphasize by smacking my hands together as she rubs her forehead.

By the time she has a response ready the match has progressed to leave 3 tanks alive, two on one team, one on the other.

""So you don't know where you are, anyone around, have anyplace to stay or remember any of school?"" She asks, just sounding tired now,

""Pretty much."" I answer.

We sit in silence, staring at each other as the climax of the match goes ignored.

Eventually we look back to the TV as a black spider like mech with 4 thick legs and another white with red stripes one on what look like a pair of sideways surfboards are introduced. 

The pilot of the black one has the sides of her head buzzed short, and the guy piloting surf boards looks like a regular ol' surfer bro with wavy blond hair and a shark tooth necklace.

""Can you at least tell me you remember your name?"" She turns back to ask,

""Uh..."" It's in here somewhere.",5,1765653016.0,HFY,4,1.0,False

1pltb32,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pltb32/the_choir_beneath_the_baptismal_well/,The choir beneath the baptismal well,"If you've ever been to St. Lazarus Baptist Church, the Victorian style building, way off of the road, in the rolling Carolina  fields, you probably have your own story. You probably got dragged to church every sunday with your grandma, made up in your finest dress with your hair pinned up or slicked back. You probably got in the old rusty truck to carpool down the dusty old red road, maybe sat in the bed with the other big kids because only babies sat in laps up front. You probably got baptized in the front behind the cathedral, spring fed and always warm. You probably felt the vibration in the water and heard the drowned choir below. 

Let me reel it in, in case you aren't one of the congregation, past or present. In case you haven't heard the baptismal choir. I was one of these kids, I'd sit in my grandma's lap as she put my hair in bows and sang hymns to me, real softly with her eyes closed. I don't know how she managed to braid so precisely with closed eyes. I never liked this routine, the fact I got pulled in from playing outside in the sticks with the boys. They were expected to be dirty, nobody would bat an eye if a little boy had a smudge of dirt on his cheek or a crumpled shirt. But a girl with a thread out of place in her skirt would get dirty looks and muttered judgement from the church elders. 

I didn't care much for judgement, I got dirty anyway. And my grandma understood, she grew up with brothers herself. In fact, I remember once at Christmas time, when I was in a red skirt with a big bow, I had so much mud on my blouse it almost looked like a pattern. Me and the boys had been having snowball fights and found out mud made them stick better. I had walked down to find our usual pew, near the front by a space hater, with my grandma close behind. Service began as normal, candles were lit and Christmas blessings given. An old greying woman scowled at me as she sang. After, my grandma got up from the pew and went over to the priest's wife, got real close to her and said something. It must've been something nasty because the woman's face turned into an awful snarl, like a dog with her lips curled back. I was outside with the other girls when my grandma joined us. She had a red mark like a handprint on her cheek, but her lips were still upturned in a smile. I asked about it, and she just shook her head and put a hand through my hair.

“Let's hurry before the truck leaves us behind. Or we'll catch our deaths.”

The years passed, and me and my grandma slowly got pushed back to the pews by the door, some social movement to make us colder, farther from the elders and other kids enjoying the heat. Nobody gave us a second glance when we got in, none of the adults, at least. Kids don't understand the tension in the air, maybe we were too short to see it in the cold stares of the adults. I played before in between and after, like always. The nuns huddled together and looked down their noses at others in their cloaks of shadows, like always. And the pastor looked grim and gaunt, like always.

My 12th birthday was coming up quickly, and I was excited. When any kid turned 12, they got to be baptized, they were seen as old enough to fully accept the church's grace. It was a sacred ceremony, and only a few people got to see it. The kid, of course, the pastor, and the kids closest parent or relative. And with it, the kids were given a list of rules they could not break or share with those younger. Every kid was excited, it felt important to be given any duty to uphold. Then we were finally seen as equals by the adults who shared the same secrets. 

My closest friend, Rebecca, turned 12 a week before I did. We were summer babies, born in the warm month of July. I was ecstatic, probably more so than she was. I found her early in the morning, when people were still pouring in and finding coffee before they sat down. She was sitting criss-cross applesauce against the wall, looking conflicted. I skipped over to her and sat down, too.

“Becca! Aren't you excited? You're basically gonna be a grown up soon.” I chattered on, listing things off on my hand about the things she could do as an ‘adult’. 

“You can get married, have babies, get a job..” I shook her shoulder while I spoke, getting her excited. It worked, and soon she was buzzing with energy. Neither of us really understood the hell of teenage years or the following monotony of adulthood. To us, being baptized was like a fairytale where we finally got our fairy wings and met our prince charming. The other teenage girls looked fondly on their baptisms and gushed about how wonderful it was to join the church fully, and how fun the choir was. The boys were similar, but they tried to act nonchalant about it. I knew they were excited. Every kid that got baptized joined the choir, it was considered the way of paying the church's blessing forward.

I eased her nerves with conversation, and she bolted up when the pastor emerged from a different room in his sacred robes, looking at her with a nod. She flattened down her dress with her hands and flashed a smile before hurrying to his side. I gave her a thumbs up, and the priest looked at me with disdain. I was deliberately obtuse at this time, I saw the adults' looks and it only encouraged me to rebel further. I gave him a wave before he turned around and vanished through the door with Rebecca at his side. The baptism ceremony was fast, maybe a few minutes long, and the pastor came back in. His long white sleeves were dark with water at the cuffs. Everyone sat down in their usual spot, my grandma pulling me up from the floor and to a pew. She laid her head on my shoulder. The service began, the sermon ended, and the choir emerged. I saw Rebecca standing with the older girls and I beamed. She was glowing, her smile bright. I could've sworn her teeth even seemed whiter, but it might've been her dark green robes acting as contrast. I waved to her. She didn't wave back, but she pressed her lips into a thin smile, and that was enough. 

The week dragged on endlessly as I went through the boring summer routines of cleaning up around the house and working in the garden. Sunday-my birthday- couldn't come fast enough. Now that I think about it, every kid's birthday was on a Sunday, regardless of the month. Every kid had their birthday on the lord's day of rest. When Sunday finally came, I was careful to mend each split end and polish my shoes until they gleamed. I wore my grandma's old dress, it was purple in a patchwork pattern above the waist, and fastened with a sparkly belt. I looked at myself in the mirror and felt older. My grandma tied my hair in a long braid that cascaded down the small of my back. I felt like royalty walking into church that day, and I could've sworn some of the nuns were proud. But, maybe it was just a trick of the light. 

I couldn't find Rebecca anywhere, and I felt a lump forming in my throat. Sure, I was excited, but I still wanted the comfort of my best friend in this monumental stage of my life. I gave up looking for her when Father Tobias motioned for me to follow him outside to the basin, behind the church by the spring. My grandma put her hand on my shoulder and guided me out of the church. This was the first time I'd seen the vessel, and it looked mystical. Wildflowers sprouted up in random spots, and the spring calmly rolled on with a soothing trickling sound. Trees with pale bark peeked out from the woodlands nearby, birds fluttered around but did not land in the water. Some of them drank from its spring at the edge, and their songs reverberated off of its surface. 

Father Thomas snapped me out of my trance by clearing his throat with an off putting mucus-y sound and gestured for me to start. I sat on the lip of the stone pool and nodded excitedly to my grandmother, who was standing nearby. I was too excited to listen to the actual words he read from a section of the Bible. Reflecting back on it, I think I was more excited about getting older than joining the church. After he finished reading, he put a cold hand to my temple and guided my head back into the water. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, before I was submerged. It felt warm and I didn't want to leave. I wasn't under for long, but it felt like a dream. I remember opening my eyes  underwater and seeing nothing but darkness. I remember the humming in my ears and the soft whispers I couldn't quite make out. After an eternity of this silent song, I was pulled back up and blessed. 

I am a member of the church now. A member of the choir, too. I don't remember what the voices told me exactly, but I do remember it was something sacred, the rules I could not break.

I have been brewing kombucha for about a year and have recently created a blog called the Art and Science of Kombucha Brewing.  Several of my initial articles goes into detail on how to safely brew kombucha. I provide a set of rules that if followed will lead to a clean and healthy brew. I can't say every time because things do happen that are out of a persons control, but all my brews have been successful, meaning no contamination present. I also have articles on creating flavorful brews with only one fermentation. I recently made a coffee kombucha and it turned out amazing. I have a Gunpowder, Hibiscus, Chamomile, Lemon tea brewing and it should be done brewing within the next week. My goal is to continue to create innovative brews using basic scientific principles in combination with different teas to create unique flavor profiles.  If interested you can check out my articles on [https://www.theartnscienceofkombuchabrewing.com/](https://www.theartnscienceofkombuchabrewing.com/)

1plt59e,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1plt59e/guy_25m_i_27f_dated_for_15_months_rings_past/,"Guy (25m) I (27f) dated for 1.5 months rings past midnight after no contact, what does it mean?","Hello, I have found myself in a confusing situation with a guy I dated for 1.5 months. Full context below, but essentially he cut things off due to differences in our life-styles and having a connection with someone else at the same time. After about a month of no-contact he has since texted and then rang me past midnight. I still miss him and the connection we had so feel open to reconnecting and exploring things if circumstances have changed. However without knowing if this is the case, I am unsure if this is a possibility from the info I have, and would welcome thoughts and advice on how to move forwards with this. 

Context: I met this guy at a party, he’s not necessarily the kind of person I would usually go for (usually I meet people who are involved in the same communities I’m in) but we clicked instantly and he asked for my number. 

At the time I was dating a couple of people (who were polyamorous) he was aware of this. I was unsure exactly what I wanted to long-term but was open to trying polyamory to see how I felt after having been in long-term monogamous relationships the majority of my adult life. He disclosed to me that he had also recently started dating another person (very early in the dating stage, he basically started talking to us both at the same time). 

Through conversations with him alongside generally reflecting on my own, I came to realise that while I was glad I had tried things and had no regrets, ultimately long term what I want is monogamy (which is also what he stated we was searching for long term also). I would have come to this realisation regardless of starting to date him, I believe seeing him simply made things clearer and sped up the process. 

After realising this I ended up breaking it off with the other people I was seeing, explaining that I had realised ultimately monogamy was what I needed long term and also respecting that for them polyamory was very important, so it was all left in good terms. 

I let him know this had happened just so he knew where I was at. He was very sweet and actually offered to be there if I needed comfort. He was also honest disclosing that he was still seeing this other girl, and feeling slight guilt as he had never been in the position of actively dating multiple people at once (having not dated much generally) before and I think me having been dating others in some way took some of that pressure and guilt off him. However at this point we had been talking and seeing each other for less than two full weeks, so again it was very early days so I told him I wasn’t expecting him to suddenly have to cut things off and make a decision, we were still getting to know each other and exploring what things could be and where they could go. 

With time passing we started spending a lot of time together, sometimes hanging out 3 times a week when in the same city (I travel a lot for work) and chatting pretty much daily. He was incredibly sweet, remembering things I shared with him, cooking for me and looking after me, enjoying shared interests together, taking me out and paying for everything etc, I haven't had a guy treat me like this make me feel so held in a really long time. One day we spent the whole day/night together as I had organised a surprise for his birthday as he had shared with me that he doesn’t usually celebrate due to struggling to organise things for himself, and i wanted to treat him. It really was a lovely day and it felt again like we were very connected and it was moving forwards. 

On that night we ended up having a conversation about the fact I was going to be going away soon to visit family abroad for 3 weeks. I was feeling a little anxious about it in terms of our situation. I communicated feeling worried that me being away would mean our connection could fade away and what our communication would be like during that time. He was very caring in his response but also honest in terms of acknowledging he couldn’t know how it would feel us having so much time apart so early on while he also had this other connection he was exploring; saying yeah maybe the other connection could then become stronger, or the time could make him realise how much he missed me and wanting to focus on us. Obviously in some ways not what you want to hear but I appreciated the honesty. 

That night we also talked about whether or not I was seeing anyone else, I told him I wasn’t explaining I had just gotten myself out of a situation where I was seeing multiple people and how towards the end I found that stressful and also had been very busy and travelling the last month or so (this was all true but also, I wasn’t actively looking to date other people because I did like him and felt invested, however I was afraid to be too vulnerable and did not want that to create weird pressure). I also learnt that night that the other woman he was seeing was still sleeping with other people but he didn’t think dating other people. 

A couple of weeks went by after that and we continued seeing and talking to each other, with things feeling increasingly serious. It reached the point where it was getting harder to feel comfortable with him seeing other people with how our relationship was going, so I decided I had to bite the bullet and be honest with him. I told him that it wasn’t an ultimatum where he had to make a decision there and then, but that I wanted to be honest, that I did really like him, and that it was beginning to feel uncomfortable him seeing two of us (as we weren’t in a polyamorous setting) and that it was making it harder to feel excited and lean into what we had. So that I wanted him to take the time he needed to make sure he knew what he wanted (trying to trust that if we were meant to be we will be) and I wanted him to explore whatever he needed to be sure and also stay in touch while I was away and then re-exploring things when I got back, but that it couldn’t go on much longer after that. He listened and seemed to understand and again was very sweet and thanked me for being honest and vulnerable with him. 

About two days before I was meant to leave we had plans to spend the day together. It was really lovely, he brought over food and we went for coffee and chatted and then came back and cuddled while we watched tv. Then just before he had to go to work (around 8pm) he asked to talk to me about something. He ended up saying he had been thinking and feeling like he had to make a decision before I went away, and essentially ended up cutting things off. He cited the reason as both of us being in some ways quite different people (think in terms of culture and value systems). This is something we had discussed very early on, with initially it being me having hesitations (as I said at the start he is not someone I would have usually gone for, but we got got along so well that I decided to be open and give it a chance). I had also raised it with him since then, asking how he felt about it and if it bothered him, he had said no, that there were questions about how we would navigate certain things such as hypothetically how we would raise kids etc, but both of us saying we felt open to exploring it. The whole thing felt very emotional, and he ended up crying. Saying this really felt like a break-up not just cutting something casual off, and how much he cared about me and would miss me, it honestly took me aback seeing him like that. We spent about an hour talking and both crying before he had to leave. He said he still really wanted to have me in his life and would love to still spend time together even if how we spent that time would have to change. I was honest that I did not think I wanted, what we had was never a friendship and given the context it felt difficult and honestly just not what I wanted. I asked him if he felt relieved having made a decision (imagining that dating two people you really like knowing you have to soon make a decision one way or the other would also be difficult in some ways). He said he didn’t feel relieved in that moment, just really sad and also stated things with the other person may not even work etc. 

He offered to chat or meet the next day (the day I was leaving) if I wanted to, I told him I did not want to meet up and needed space but would reach out if there was anything I needed to discuss. The next day he reached out checking in. I had realised I felt frustrated about his decision in regards to him having never flagged his concerns despite me raising it myself, and having never had a discussion with me about it. I didn’t raise it with the hoped it would change his mind, but because in the past I have bottled things and I needed to express it just for myself. He initially had really framed things as being worried about what he could offer me not being enough etc etc and being worried about me compromising my lifestyle in some way because of him. I made it clear that I know myself and what I stand for and would not compromise things I didn’t feel okay with for him or anyone else. That I had been open with him and wanted to have those discussions with him because I’m also not two dimensional and the things I want in life sometimes do conflict and there is room for compromise which we had talked about, and that the way he painted it with this coming from me didn’t sit right with me. He ended up acknowledging the pressure didn’t come from me but from him, and worrying what he could offer me in this regard wasn’t enough. That it had never been a problem while we were together, but because of the situation of him having to make a decision he started worrying it could present challenges in the future, despite the fact that if this other person wasn’t in the picture it probably wouldn’t even be a consideration for him, at least at this stage. He apologised and said he was sorry we didn’t get to explore more what this could be. 

After that I did not reply, as I felt I had said everything I needed to at that stage. I went away for 3 weeks then to visit my family, during this time we had no contact and while I missed him and sometimes wondered if we could re-connect if circumstances changed, I had no intention of reaching out or chasing him. Under a week after I was back I received a text from him, it said something along the lines of ‘Hey’ I don’t know if you’re back yet, but if you are I would love to meet up and hear about your trip! Maybe go for a coffee? I understand if you don’t want to see me, but I thought I would put the offer out there’. When I got the text it felt nice to know he had not completely forgotten about me, but I also reminded myself how he wanted to be friends, and how I did not think this was something that would be positive for me. He made the decision to pursue another connection over ours which he had every right to do, but to me this also meant he now doesn’t get to keep me around. I was unsure whether to reply or not. Part of me wanted to just because I missed him and was curious, but because of everything I have just explained it did not feel wise and I was also working on a big legal case meaning I was absolutely swamped and it felt like the last thing I needed to add on top, so I decided to leave it, at least for then. 

Another week went by and one night I am listening to a podcast as I fall asleep. Suddenly the podcast stopped playing (I’m half asleep at this point), I assume maybe it’s buffering, but after a few seconds still nothing. I decide to look at my phone screen to see what is going on, when I see his name as the phone shows him ringing. At this point it’s past midnight, and it rang the whole way through. I was really surprised and unsure what to do, I decided not to pick up because as I was unprepared and anxious to have any conversation at that time with him not knowing what he wanted. The next morning I woke up to no messages, nothing saying ’sorry I didn’t meant to ring’ (which I would say if I accidentally rang someone) but also nothing explaining why he rang or stating what he wanted to talk about. Honestly it has really thrown me, before that I felt happy leaving things, but since then I have not been able to stop questioning why he rung and whether to contact him or not. 

The way I’ve been feeling is the door between us is shut, but maybe not entirely locked (with a part of me really wanting to try again if the circumstances have changed because I did really like and value the connection we had, I haven't felt this way for someone in a long time). But also not wanting this to hold me back and just waiting around for him if nothing has changed (which he hasn’t stated has). Before he called I felt like just leaving things and ignoring the text, but the phone call has thrown me. I guess wondering why he called at that time (I would personally not randomly ring someone I had dated wanting to be friends at that time just to be friends) but maybe I am reading into it too much because of my own feelings. 

I know the most solid advice is almost always to just lock the door and move on, don’t reply. And while I logically know this is probably the most sound advice… I am curious as to what others think the call could mean (I’ve received varying opinions from friends), if there is a chance he is open to reconnecting, and if I wanted to explore the possibility of trying again (which I do) what would be the most strategic move?

After ko iconfess sa kanya yung feelings ko, she told me na eversince were friends ay gusto na nya talaga ako and natatakot lang sya baka daw masayang ang friendship namin. Naging kami naman for 2 years but nung naging busy ako sa aking work, dumalas yung away namin dahil nawawalan na ako ng time sa kanya. Naging LDR kami and magiging ldr din talaga kase she’s a med student and gusto ng family nya na sumunod sa kanila sa canada. I told her na intindihin nya ako at bigyan lang ng few years para makapagsarili na ako and start my own company. Napagod sya and we broke up, I choose my career dahil alam ko na magiging sucessful ako and pwede na lang sya mag stay sa pinas pero she gave up. sobrang pagod na sya kakaintindi sakin at nawalan na sya ng tiwala.

Few years past at naging sucessful na nga ako sa career ko, I have my own small IT company pero slowly palaki na rin ng palaki. Palagi ko pa rin sya iniistalk gamit yung isa kong dummy account na friend pa rin sya(nakablock main account ko). Ang ganda pa rin nya and still single, I was hoping na sana magkausap kami and magkabalikan dahil mahal na mahal ko pa rin talaga sya. This year was the busiest year, dumami clients namin and sobrang stress kami lahat. Di ko na rin sya naistalk dahil halos walang tulog araw araw. 

Nasa isang coffee shop ako one time ng makita ko yung isa naming common friend. Syempre nilapitan ko sya at para bang galit sya sakin. I thought dahil naghiwalay kami ng friend nya pero di ko inaasahan yung sumunod na sinabi nya, my love of my life is gone. She past away months ago dahil sa road accident. Nag try pala silang icontact ako sa social media pero sobrang busy nga ako at hindi naman talaga ako gumagamit ng mga ganung platform at yun lang talaga ang way of communication namin. Galit sila lahat sakin, bakit ko daw nagawang di magpakita sa kanya nung nasa ICU pa sya.

Sobrang nawasak ako, lahat ng pagod at effort ko para sa career ko ay para talaga sa future naming dalawa. Di ko alam kung anong gagawin ko, di ako makausap ng maayos sa office. Nag back out dalawa naming clients, marami naging problema sa company at halos yung iba gusto na mag resign. Di ko alam kung para san pa lahat ng investment ko. Sobrang sakit, wala akong pakialam sa mga nangyayari ngayon sa office, wala akong pake kung magsialisan lahat sila, wala akong pake kung lahat ng eto ay mawala. Wala na yung nag iisang rason kung bakit pa ako nagpupursigi sa buhay. Wala na yung taong gusto kong makasama habangbuhay. Wala na yung taong gusto ko marinig na sabihin na “Proud ako sayo”. Wala na yung taong gusto ko titigan habang nakangiti.

“You are not a valued customer, sound is not allowed.” The Guard said plainly, his mouth a dark abyss from which the words floated out from. Dropping me to the ground, the Guard lowered himself to meet my gaze, morphing his mouth into a smile shaped void and echoing: “Shhh!”

Seemingly satisfied with himself the Guard turned his back to me as he went to leave, which is when I swiftly struck him in the head with the rock I found earlier. As the guard fell forwards with a heavy thud I used both of my hands to steady my grip on the rock, hitting him again and again. 

Standing above the body I was fighting against the urge to throw up, the mangled mess of the guard’s head was too much for me to look at. Inspecting him from the neck down however, he truly did seem like this place’s security as he wore a uniform akin to police in the real world. Still it was obvious this was a fake uniform, just slightly off enough in its details to make me unnerved. It's almost as if this place exists to fill in a gap in reality; some cheap placeholder for when the real world stops making sense, something that was quickly thrown together in the hopes no one would notice the difference.

Aside from a keychain I found nothing else of note on the Guard’s body, so I hastily left the cell I was and immediately looked into the cell to my right, as I am certain this is where the voice from earlier came from.

It seems I was right, as in the far corner of the decrepit cell there was a woman trying to press herself into the corner, almost as if in hopes she would be invisible there. Upon noticing it was me who stood in front of her and not the Guard her eyes widened in surprise, yet she remained unmoving. 

In a hushed tone I asked the woman: 

“Are there more?”

After some silence she hesitantly answered:

“I don't know, I… I’ve only seen one guard here, always him…” Her voice trailed off, barely above a whisper.

“What do you know about this place? Is there a way out?” I asked, hopeful she would know something I don’t.

“If there was, do you think I would be here?” She responded harshly, anger quickening in her voice. “Is the interrogation over now? Can you let me out of here?” She continued, getting more agitated by the second.

I was at a crossroads. While I did want to release the woman from her confinement I just couldn’t trust her. There are too many things in this place that act like people only to try and kill you seconds later. I needed to be sure that she was a human being.

“What’s your name?” I began, further questions on my mind.

“Veronica.”

“Where were you before this?” 

“Driving to my niece’s birthday party. I stopped to get gas and next thing I remember I’m here.” She responded, her face conveying pain as she remembered about her family.

I didn’t have much to go on, but her response calmed me a little. Her demeanor seemed normal, she didn't twitch, and most importantly her mouth actually moved and mouthed the words she was speaking as opposed to just echoing out her voice. If she truly wasn’t human she was good at pretending to be one.

With slight apprehension, I moved towards the cell door, and opened it. If I am wrong about my decision I will find out now. Instead of being attacked however, Veronica quietly began sobbing. Trying to keep her noise down as she lowered her head, avoiding my eyes.

“Sorry…” she sniffled. “I’ve just been stuck here for so long that I thought I’d die here.” She continued, trying to hold back her tears.

As we started walking down the hallway, there was a feeling of optimism mixed with fear in the air. The hallway beyond the cells seemed to go on forever, the cold pale lights casting a sickly flickering light above us as we progressed through it. Veronica followed closely behind me, our footsteps echoing against the concrete floor. Every sound we made felt too loud, like we were one badly placed step away from attracting more of those guards to us. 

There wasn't much conversation between us. I didn’t want to risk any more noise than necessary and she seems to be on the same page. Beyond that though, what would I even say to her? Everything I could think of saying to her would get outweighed in my mind for either being too stupid or unnecessary noise, so I remained quiet.

After some time we reached the end of the hallway, an old rusty ladder ascending into darkness above us. The metal rungs were cold, simultaneously feeling slick and coarse on my hand. It seems like they don’t even know how to make ladders here, as the rungs had awkward and uneven spacing between them.

Turning to Veronica I whisper, “Ladies first.”

She gave me a look. “Absolutely not. Do you really think I’m going to climb up a ladder I can't see the top of before you do?”

“Fair enough.” I responded defeated, before grabbing a rung and beginning our climb.

Reaching the top of the ladder, I began pushing on what seemed to be a trap door. It wasn’t locked, but the amount of resistance I faced told me something heavy was on top of it. Pushing on the door with more effort, it creaked loudly as the door gave way and light flooded in from above. As I hoisted myself up I offered Veronica a hand.

Looking around we seemed to be in another room, this one built more like a warehouse and filled with cardboard. Stacks upon stacks of cardboard went all the way up towards the ceiling, like makeshift walls. Some of the boxes had barcodes, some had the same slightly off writing present everywhere in this place, and some… some had images of people. Just average people's faces, their facial features etched onto the cardboard boxes themselves like some morbid form of art.

One of the faces was looking straight at us.

The face didn’t move at first. It just stared at us from above — a flat, printed image that shouldn’t have been capable of expression. And yet, in its face there was clear emotion, something like desperation or maybe obsession? I could feel the face’s eyes on me, conveying this weird begging look I could not understand. That’s when I noticed that the box began to wiggle ever so slightly… It was slow but it was moving.

Looking at Veronica, I realized she wasn’t staring at the same one I was. Her eyes were fixed on another box in a stack nearby.

Then I saw more.

Dread began to fill my body as these kinds of boxes were everywhere, randomly scattered across the stacks of cardboard boxes we walked near. Some of the faces held that same twisted look from before, while others were blank. It didn’t seem to matter where we were or how far we walked inside of the warehouse, they all knew exactly where to look in order to stare at us.

SPLAT.

The sound echoed throughout the stacks, a sickening wetness to it like something heavy fell behind us and burst open.

Veronica was the first to react, gasping in shock at the sudden loudness. I turned just in time to see one of those boxes burst open on the ground, its form a pulpy mess on the ground where it fell. I didn’t have a lot of time to take in the view however, as I saw more of the boxes writhe, twitch, and jostle themselves off the stacks they were a part of, cascading mounds of boxes all around us.

“RUN!” I shouted, my voice barely rising above the cacophony of sound exploding around us.

We bolted across the maze, stacks of cardboard collapsing behind us. Despite all the sounds — the wet impact from the faced boxes as they jumped off their stacks in an attempt to hit us, the thud of the stacks they supported falling apart from their absence. Each impact of the boxes raised with it dust and this indescribable smell that seemed to be between damp paper and rotting meat.

As we continued making our way through the maze we were faced with two branching paths ahead of us: one going left and the other going right. There were signs of arrows with what I think is a description written, just not in any language I could understand. I turned to look at Veronica only to realize she was already looking at me.

“Your call.” She said calmly, contrasting the panic and fear her eyes were showing me.

With the echoing splatters growing closer behind us I took us leftward, with no real reason behind that choice other than it just felt right ironically enough.

As we traversed the hallway the stacks of boxes gradually began to narrow and shorten, giving the impression that the space around us was getting smaller, tighter. 

After a while the boxes seemed less like boxes and more like… flesh, bending and folding in a way that cardboard wouldn't. This started to feel less like we are in a building and more like we are in a living being, something that ate us without us even noticing. 

We turned a corner— or at least it felt like we did, and came out onto a wider aisle which surprisingly smelled… clean, sterile in a way that reminded me of the “employees” of this place if you can call them that.

Before I knew it Veronica grabbed my arm, pulling me back behind a shelf. Her nails dug into my sleeve.

“Don’t move,” she whispered.

I was confused but quickly understood why she did that. At the end of the aisle underneath flickering lights I saw one of the workers, its skin tied so tightly around its lanky frame that parts of it were exposed, showing a sort of black fuzz where you would expect flesh to be. 

Scary as it was, what really got my attention is who the worker was seemingly talking to. 

At first glance I mistook it for a man — tall and gaunt, draped in what appeared to be a coat. But as my eyes adjusted I could tell that it was not a coat — not in the conventional sense, it was skin. All of the skin that should have been on its body was instead draped on it like a cape, long and pale skin just loosely hanging on its frame instead of covering it. Its limbs were even more repulsive, long and twisting, its joints bending in directions that didn’t make sense. While the area around us smelled clean there was a subtle aroma now— something sickly sweet, an oddly pleasant aroma which contrasted greatly against its repulsive source.

Its face was the worst part. I felt like I would've seen something slightly human, being its humanoid form and all but I was sorely mistaken. Its head was far too small for its lanky frame, with a singular eye in its center. 

The worker stood in front of the creature, posture rigid and with a clipboard in hand, as it opened its mouth and echoed:

“Hello Valued Customer, how can I assist you today?” The worker asked, more of that black fuzz from before leaking out of its mouth and dripping onto the floor.

The creature stared at it until its eyeball contorted, tearing and bleeding as it rearranged itself into a mouth. The words that came out of its mouth sounded coarse and strained – as if speaking were difficult for it to do.

“Same order. Fresher.”

“Why of course!” The employee responded enthusiastically, before continuing. “We have just received a new shipment, would you like to explore our options?” 

The creature nodded, returning the worker’s smile with its own, its mouth displaying a perfect set of human teeth. Something about seeing that smile filled my body with terror. 

The worker gestured down the aisle, and two more workers appeared from the shadows, carrying boxes — the kind with faces on them. The faces were awake, blinking slowly, their mouths twitching open and closed.

The creature dragged its hand upon one of the boxes which violently jolted in response, as if it were trying to flee. The creature released a sound that might have been confused with a laugh — just wetter.

“Good stock.” It said simply before grabbing one of the boxes from the workers, then analyzing the other box afterwards. “I’ll take them.”

“Excellent choice valued customer! We will prepare these for transport right away!” The worker responded gleefully, putting the clipboard away into its chest. “Thank you for your continued patronage, valued customer.” 

As the creatures walked away towards a door at the far end of the aisle I could feel Veronica shaking, her body trembling as she held on to my arm. 

We waited until the sound of their footsteps faded. The aisle felt emptier now, but not safer. My body was screaming at me to go, to get out of this place, but I knew that the only way out outside of the tunnel we just crawled through was the door those creatures went into. It was in that silence that both Veronica and I heard it — the unmistakable sound of those disgusting boxes dragging themselves towards us.

Veronica looked at me, eyes wide, pupils trembling.

“We can’t stay here,” she whispered. “It’s only a matter of time until those boxes start making noises and they come back.”

She was right. If we stalled in here too long those boxes would definitely get the attention of whatever the hell that thing was that we just saw, and I did not want that.

Looking at the door at the end of the aisle it seemed almost… normal? Just a regular framed door, which now that I think about it should not have been able to accommodate the height of those creatures. 

Trying not to think too much about it, I turned to Veronica and met her gaze. “That way,” I said quietly.

Before I could think twice, we started moving toward the same door the creature disappeared through.

Walking through that door didn’t make sense. One moment we stepped forward, and the next we were somewhere that wasn’t anywhere — just a sea of black, thick and endless. There was no sound, no up or down, just the faint sense of moving without moving. It felt like we had been walking for years, maybe longer, but at the same time… it couldn’t have been more than a second before we found ourselves in a room.

Immediately we were on edge, I mean could you blame us? The things we have seen… We need to get the hell out of here.

But as I looked around the room I couldn’t help but feel… safe? Well maybe safer is the correct term here

We were in a room. Just… a normal room. Beige walls. Drop ceiling. Fluorescent lights that didn’t flicker for once. There was a table with half drank coffees and strewn about bagels that seemed to be genuine, real food for once. The smell hit me and I almost cried. Veronica touched the table too, like she needed to make sure it wouldn’t disappear if she blinked.

“Hey Matteo, take a look at this.” Veronica called me over, and as I turned in her direction I saw it.

The wall she was looking at had a bunch of framed pictures on it, with the words “EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH” in big bold lettering above it.

Looking at the frames what took me by surprise was the perfectly legible text beneath every picture:

“Humans served: 500.” Underneath the first picture I looked with my eyes widening as I saw the more recent pictures, their misspelled months above their frames.

“Humans served: 1,000.”

“Humans served: “2,300.”

“Humans served: “5,000.”

All of these paled to the most recent picture, containing something I can’t even describe… just an absolute abomination. That sickly shiny skin, the twisted angles, those eyes… It was all too much. 

“Humans served: 10,000.” Next to the plaque there was a sticker of a golden star with “You’re a star!” In the middle. 

I laughed, not because it was funny but because of how absurd this place is. Some bizarre thing out there saw how humans transacted business and recreated it into this twisted monstrosity. 

“Hey, I think I found our way out.” Veronica said before walking over and handing me a pamphlet. I could've sworn she was right next to me looking at this wall just a second ago, where did she get this?

“Where did this come from?” I ask immediately, looking over the pamphlet which says “Welcome Valued Employee!” On its covers.

“On the table over there.” Veronica replied plainly, but there was something about how she spoke that I couldn't place. Her demeanor and voice seemed different than it was just moments ago.

“Are you gonna read it?” She quipped, annoyed at me just holding it.

Hello Valued Employee!

Questions? Head on over to our HR Department on floor 1324!

The Abaddon Team

What. The. Fuck.

With my hands shaking I let the pamphlet fall onto the floor in front of me. I hadn’t even fully registered what I said before Veronica spoke up again.

“Why are you acting so scared? This is our way out!!” She exclaimed way more excitedly than she should, as if the implication of that pamphlet wasn’t horrifying.

Sensing my judgement and meeting my gaze she adjusted, “I’m just saying that this is the first time I’ve seen ANY mention on how this place operates. We can use the uniforms to blend in and get out of here!”

I could not help but frown at the idea of wearing skin over my own, which made me feel sick. 

“Okay so we blend in and get out of here. Then what?” I asked, hoping she was seeing something that I didn’t.

“No idea.” She said flatly. “But knowing that there is a chance we can get out of here is enough for me to try.”

She was right as things stood now we would eventually be caught and reimprisoned, if not worse. While I was still trying to process what we’d just read, Veronica wandered off toward a small closet door by the vending machine, “Uniforms” written across it in plain white text. 

As Veronica pulled the door open a wave of cold air poured out. Inside, hung neatly like any other work uniforms, were rows of pale, fleshy things. They had zippers running down their backs, and some of the faces stitched into them twitched when the light hit. Veronica just stared for a long time, then turned back to me with this expression I couldn’t read. “Guess we found our uniforms,” she said.

She reached for one of the uniforms, and for a second, I swore the rest leaned toward her. I wanted to stop her, but the look in her eyes wasn’t fear anymore, it was acceptance. Acceptance of what needed to be done for survival.

And that terrified me more than anything else in this place.

Putting on the suit, I was immediately repulsed by how slimy it felt against my skin. The fact that it twitched and bulged in certain places did not help either. When I looked at Veronica, she was tightening her suit and didn’t seem bothered at all by the fact that we were basically wearing decorated skin, in fact the expression on her face made it seem like she was… bored?

“Are you ready?” She asked, as if reading my thoughts.

“Yeah but…” I stammered out, before continuing, “...how are you just like, okay with all this?” I asked.

“What do you mean?” She asked, giving me a curious look.

“Are you not repulsed by this? We’re probably wearing actual skin that belonged to another person.” I added, shuddering at the thought of how these suits may have been acquired.

Her response was not what I expected. She stared at me for a good long while, long enough to make me uncomfortable and fidgety.

“I have been here for years. They don’t kill me because I’m ‘damaged product’ but I can’t leave either, just stuck in this hellhole for the rest of my life. That is until you freed me and we actually got away! The danger we are in is only fueling me to get the hell out of this place, and to be honest with you Matteo…” Veronica trailed off, avoiding eye contact with me as she continued, “...there isn’t much I wouldn’t do to get out of this place.” She said plainly.

While she didn’t explicitly say it, I got the implication all the same: if it came to me or her, she’s choosing herself. I can’t say that I blame her for it, if it were between me and her I’d choose myself too. The difference is that I didn’t already have my mind made up about it; I’d probably try to help her even at my own risk but now I knew that she wouldn't do the same. I have to keep my guard up around her.

With no other way of egress we turned back around and left through the door that we used to first come into this room. While this time it operated as a normal door, we were surprised to see my car parked on the other side, engine running and ready to go. As we tried to go through the door however, we couldn’t. While I could see my car it was like there was an invisible wall blocking the actual entryway of the door. God we were so close, it was literally right there!

Closing the door and reopening it kept showing a multitude of different locations. We saw what looked to be a processing section of the facility with all sorts of machines operating, now as to what they were building I could not say. We saw an even bigger storage room with more of those revolting boxes, with a heavy splat reminding us to close the door. We even saw what appeared to be a grandfather and his grandson on a farm. Whatever they were doing the mood must have been somber as there was a dead dog next to them, the boy was crying and who appeared to be his grandfather was holding a rifle. I didn’t stick around to watch that and just kept opening and closing the door until it gave us somewhere we could actually access.

This took a long time though, with Veronica and I alternating as the door kept flipping between different locations yet unwilling to actually let us go anywhere. I think it was around the fifth time we saw my running car that Veronica snapped:

“To hell with this.” She said, slamming the door shut so hard it snapped off one of its hinges and laid half supported across the door frame. Well so much for that I guess.

After a moment of silence between us as we stared at one another, she suddenly beelined for the uniform locker and opened it. 

Where once was the skin suits all hung up neatly now had a very narrow hallway, barely wide enough for one person let alone two. We would have to go through in a single file line.

Moving while wearing the suit was… difficult. Despite it having none of the fuzz we saw leaking out of other suits, the ones we wore still twitched and writhed as we went, occasionally making me bump against the walls as I walked. The hallway kept getting narrower pretty consistently, with us soon having to turn our bodies sideways and navigate that way.

Just as the hallway began to grip onto my chest and back I pushed through out into what seemed to be shelves, dozens if not hundreds of rows of gas station products covered the place in a cacophony of color, overstimulating your eyes everywhere they looked.

Veronica pushed past me and began beelining into a partition between the rows, and when I looked ahead of her I understood why she was running so fast: the glass doors of the front of the gas station were visible. It was really far, but just at the edge of my vision I could see the blue outline of them.

I began to move behind Veronica, after all for all I know she could get through those doors and book it in my car, leaving me stranded. That’s even if my car was there in the first place.

Just as I was going to sprint after her I saw an enormous hand come out from a few rows ahead, which Veronica collided into at full speed. I heard her yelp as she fell backwards onto the floor, dazed and probably still trying to process what just happened. She never stood a chance.

The hand wrapped its grotesque decaying fingers around her and… simply held her there. I wanted to move towards her as she cried out to be, begging me to come save her.

All I could do was watch as an enormous box dropped onto her, not ending in a splat but a crash that shook the ground I stood on.

“Fuck. FUCK. Holy fucking shit she’s dead.” I thought, my mind reeling as I tried to figure out what to do. I knew that the exit was right there but I was too petrified to move, not even as the giant box’s eyes fixated themselves upon me, its form wriggling towards me as it squished Veronica’s blood out further onto the ground. 

She really was gone.

Whatever I was feeling I couldn’t just stand there, so instead of running down the center I started speedwalking away towards the aisles, hoping that the grid like pattern of this room could keep me alive. While I understood that running straight down the row was dangerous, were the aisles any safer? 

As if on cue I turned a corner to see… something. Its shape was more or less human but there were just too many eyes. It came up to me and blinked in a random pattern; different parts of its body opening and closing like a game of wack-a-mole.

I had no clue what it wanted from me but I could tell I needed to respond. It must not have been attacking me either because of the suit or because it doesn’t realize I’m a human, so I have to blend in to make it out.

Not really knowing what to do, I just grabbed the nearest product on a shelf near us, this time what appeared to be a bag of fleshy crickets, and said:

“Valued customer yes buy.”

It stared at me. I said it again, more forceful this time.

“Valued customer yes buy.”

It stared at me another moment before grabbing the bag and walking away, some of its eyes shedding tears in what appeared to be sorrow.

As I continued to navigate my way through I eventually found myself a few aisles away from the glass doors, it’s right there, I thought as I prepared myself to cross over to the next aisle. Two more to go.

One more.

I was there. Walking towards the doors I pushed it outward and was relieved to see that it really was my car there, still running as it had been when I first got to this place. I also immediately ripped off my skin suit, it hissing in protest before deflating and laying flatly on the ground.

I took one last look around my perimeter. There were no other cars, no employees… It looks like I truly was free. Without delay I got into my car, got it onto the road and started reversing. Veronica would not die in vain, I would get out of here alive no matter how long it took.

I was not prepared for just how long it would actually take though, as I just kept reversing in a straight line for what felt like years. I knew that I was doing something right however as my car slowly started to come back to normal, my odometer displayed the correct mileage and my levers displayed the right information.

It was not much longer after this that my phone buzzed. I had almost forgotten I even still had it, but as I sat there looking at the screen I began to cry tears of joy.

“Estimated Time of Arrival to your destination: 20 minutes.

In 500 feet take a right.”

Without hesitation I took the right turn, sending my car flying through the foliage on the side of the road. Twenty minutes was how far I was from my house when I first got dragged into this mess. I was free!

Soon after I got on the highway and made my way home, relief washed over me like a wave. It was only when I arrived at my room that I realized just how hopeless my situation was. I stood there trying to process what I was seeing, the big white letters plastered on my closet door all the while:

- **Strength:** Despite extreme emaciation, SCP-33333 can exert force equivalent to industrial hydraulic equipment. During Incident 33333-Alpha, SCP-33333-Prime tore through 15cm reinforced steel plating using only its hands.
- **Speed:** Capable of sustained movement at 55 km/h with burst acceleration to 80 km/h for periods up to 90 seconds.
- **Durability:** Entity survived direct hits from .50 caliber armor-piercing rounds with minimal tissue damage. Small arms fire (9mm, 5.56mm) demonstrates <5% efficacy.
- **Regeneration:** Moderate-severity wounds (lacerations, fractures) heal completely within 4-6 hours. Major trauma requires 24-48 hours.

**2. Cognitive Hazard Projection:**
SCP-33333 constantly emits low-level memetic influence within a 15-meter radius. Prolonged exposure (>20 minutes) causes subjects to develop obsessive thoughts about ""Half-Life 3"" and express increasing skepticism toward reality.

**3. Reality Anchoring Resistance:**
SCP-33333 demonstrates partial immunity to standard reality-stabilization technology. Scranton Reality Anchors operating below 0.8 Hume baseline are insufficient to fully suppress its anomalous capabilities.

**4. Compound-33333-H Secretion:**
Entity continuously produces 2-4 liters of Compound-33333-H per 24-hour period through biological processes. This substance is highly infectious and capable of creating new SCP-33333 instances.

**5. Berserker State Activation:**
When exposed to ""Mega Man"" related stimuli, SCP-33333 enters a frenzied state characterized by:
- 300% increase in aggression and strength
- Complete loss of self-preservation instinct
- Focused destruction of the offending stimulus regardless of consequences
- Increased Compound-33333-H secretion rate (8-10 liters per hour)
- Vocalization shifts to incoherent screaming and phrases including ""NOT MEGA MAN"", ""WE WAITED FOR THIS?"", and ""FRAUD""

**6. Crowbar Amplification Effect:**
If SCP-33333 acquires any crowbar-type implement, it undergoes immediate catastrophic power escalation (see Addendum 33333-C: Crowbar Incident). This represents the primary existential threat posed by the entity.

### Apollyon-Class Escalation Conditions

When SCP-33333-Prime receives additional exposure to Compound-33333-H beyond saturation levels, the entity undergoes rapid metamorphosis into an Apollyon-class threat:

**Stage 1 (0-15 minutes post-overdose):**
- Height increases to 3.5-4m
- Bioluminescence intensity reaches 3,000+ lumens
- Vocalization volume exceeds 160 decibels (permanent hearing damage range)
- Compound-33333-H secretion increases exponentially (40+ liters per hour)
- Physical strength increases by estimated 400%

**Stage 2 (15-60 minutes post-overdose):**
- Entity develops ability to transmit Compound-33333-H infection through line-of-sight exposure alone
- Reality-warping capabilities manifest: localized Hume level fluctuations, spontaneous matter conversion
- Demonstrates telekinetic manipulation of objects up to 500kg
- Creates autonomous ""echo"" projections of itself (limited duration: 5-10 minutes per echo)
- Attacks become coordinated multi-vector assaults

**Stage 3 (60+ minutes post-overdose):**
- Full XK-Class ""Unforseen Consequences"" scenario initiation
- Entity begins spontaneous duplication through mitosis-like process
- Atmospheric concentration of Compound-33333-H reaches infectious levels within 2km radius
- Standard containment becomes impossible without complete site destruction
- Projected global saturation of Compound-33333-H: 72-96 hours

All Apollyon-class escalations require immediate Protocol Hunt-Down-The-Freeman activation with nuclear authorization.

**Mechanism of Action:**

Compound-33333-H operates as a multi-system neurotoxic agent with cognitohazardous properties affecting neurotransmitter regulation, reality perception, and psychological stability.

**Neurochemical Effects:**
The compound crosses the blood-brain barrier within 90 seconds of exposure via novel transport mechanism. Once in neural tissue, it:

1. Binds irreversibly to D2 and D3 dopamine receptors, causing sustained hyperactivation (+420% baseline dopamine)
2. Antagonizes GABA-A receptors, eliminating inhibitory neural control
3. Activates NMDA glutamate receptors, causing excitotoxic cascade
4. Disrupts serotonergic pathways, eliminating mood regulation
5. Modifies hippocampal function, causing progressive memory replacement
6. Alters prefrontal cortex activity, destroying executive function and risk assessment

**Infection Progression - Complete Timeline:**

**Phase 1: Euphoric Delusion (0-6 hours post-exposure)**
- Subjects experience profound euphoria and inflated sense of optimism
- Cognitive fixation begins on improbable positive future events
- Sleep resistance develops; subjects report feeling ""too excited to rest""
- Risk assessment capabilities diminish by ~60%
- First mentions of ""Half-Life 3"" begin appearing in conversation
- Subjects begin rationalizing increasingly unlikely scenarios as ""definitely happening soon""
- Physiological: Elevated heart rate (+20-30 bpm), pupil dilation, increased perspiration
- Biochemical: Dopamine levels reach 340% of baseline

**Phase 2: Obsessive Fixation (6-24 hours post-exposure)**
- ""Half-Life 3"" becomes dominant topic in 65-80% of vocalizations
- All other interests and responsibilities begin fading
- Subjects develop elaborate ""theories"" and ""evidence"" for imminent announcement
- First signs of physical deterioration: pallor, reduced appetite

- Subjects become hostile when Half-Life 3's existence is questioned
- First signs of dental malformation and jaw extension
- Physiological: Extreme dehydration despite fluid intake, muscle wasting, bone density reduction
- Biochemical: Blood plasma contains detectable Compound-33333-H

**Phase 4: Identity Destruction (72-120 hours post-exposure)**
- Complete personality erasure; all memories, preferences, and identity replaced
- Subjects speak ONLY about Half-Life 3; no other topics elicit any response
- Ocular tissue begins yellowing as luminescent compound replaces natural structures
- Bodily fluids (saliva, tears, sweat, blood) fully converted to Compound-33333-H (70-85% concentration)
- Subject becomes actively contagious; any fluid contact transmits infection
- Extreme aggression toward anyone suggesting Half-Life 3 will not be released
- Physical transformation accelerates: skeletal reshaping, muscle deterioration, skin necrosis
- Constant vocalization: screaming demands for ""more hopium"" and ""the announcement""
- Subjects begin scratching the number ""3"" obsessively into any available surface
- Physiological: BMI drops to 12-13, body temperature drops to 35°C, heart rate irregular
- Biochemical: Full systemic conversion to anomalous biology initiated

**Phase 5: Complete Transformation (120-168 hours post-exposure)**
- Physical transformation into SCP-33333 instance finalized
- Subject designated as new instance (SCP-33333-01, -02, -03, etc.)
- All human traits eliminated; entity is now anomalous hostile organism
- Demonstrates full suite of SCP-33333 capabilities: superhuman strength/speed, reality resistance

## Compound-33333-C (""Copium"") - Complete Chemical Analysis

**IUPAC Designation:** (2S,3R,4S,5R)-2-[4-amino-2-oxopyrimidin-1-yl]-5-[(benzoyloxy)methyl]-4-fluoro-3-hydroxyoxolan-2-yl complex with Foundation proprietary compounds

**Molecular Formula:** C₂₈H₃₉N₅O₉·[CLASSIFIED FOUNDATION ASSET-Θ]
**Molecular Weight:** ~589.64 g/mol (base compound)
**CAS Number:** [FOUNDATION CLASSIFIED]
**Appearance:** Translucent pale blue liquid (Pantone 2905C)
**Physical State:** Liquid at standard temperature and pressure
**Density:** 1.06 g/cm³ at 20°C
**Viscosity:** 820 cP at 20°C
**Boiling Point:** 312°C
**Melting Point:** -8°C
**pH:** 6.9-7.1 (neutral)
**Luminosity:** None (non-luminescent)
**Refractive Index:** 1.489
**Solubility:** Fully miscible with water and biological fluids
**Odor:** Odorless
**Flash Point:** 156°C
**Stability:** Stable indefinitely when stored at 4°C in dark containers

**Composition Breakdown:**
- 49% Foundation Asset-Θ (classified proprietary antidotal compound)
- 27% GABA receptor positive allosteric modulators
- 13% Selective serotonin reuptake enhancers (modified SSRIs)
- 9% Nootropic stabilization complex (includes piracetam derivatives)
- 2% Reality-anchoring microparticles (suspended Scranton field generators, nanoscale)

**Mechanism of Action:**

Compound-33333-C functions as the sole effective pharmaceutical intervention for Compound-33333-H exposure. Its mechanism operates through multiple therapeutic pathways:

**Primary Mechanisms:**
1. **Competitive Antagonism:** Compound-33333-C molecules competitively bind to the same neural receptor sites targeted by Compound-33333-H, displacing the toxic compound
2. **Neurotransmitter Restoration:** Gradually restores normal dopamine, serotonin, and GABA regulation over 48-72 hours
3. **Cognitive Stabilization:** Active compounds cross blood-brain barrier and provide reality-grounding effects, reducing delusional thinking
4. **Metabolic Neutralization:** Catalyzes breakdown of Compound-33333-H into non-toxic metabolites via novel enzymatic pathways
5. **Reality Anchoring:** Nanoscale Scranton field generators stabilize local reality, preventing further anomalous transformation

**Therapeutic Effects - Timeline:**

**Immediate (0-30 minutes post-administration):**
- Acute agitation reduced by 40-60%
- Vocalization volume decreases
- Violent tendencies partially suppressed
- Subject becomes marginally more responsive to external stimuli

**Short-term (1-12 hours post-administration):**
- Cognitive fixation intensity decreases
- Subject able to acknowledge topics other than Half-Life 3 (brief periods)
- Compound-33333-H secretion rate reduced by 70%
- Physical aggression diminished by 50-65%
- Minor improvement in communication capability

**Medium-term (12-72 hours continuous treatment):**
- Significant reduction in delusional thinking
- Partial restoration of memory and personality (Phase 1-3 subjects only)
- Physical deterioration halted; no improvement but no further decline
- Bioluminescence intensity decreases (ocular changes permanent)
- Subject demonstrates near-normal cognitive function for 10-20 minute periods

**Long-term (72+ hours continuous treatment):**
- Maximum achievable therapeutic effect reached
- Subjects in Phase 1-3 at exposure can achieve 60-80% functional recovery
- Phase 4-5 subjects (full SCP-33333 instances) stabilize but cannot recover beyond 20-30% baseline humanity
- Permanent dependency on Compound-33333-C develops; cessation causes rapid relapse
- Physical deformities remain permanent; cosmetic correction impossible

**Critical Limitations:**

1. **Irreversibility Threshold:** Subjects who reach Phase 5 (complete transformation) cannot be restored to human baseline. Treatment only prevents further deterioration and reduces hostility.

2. **Permanent Dependency:** All treated subjects require continuous administration. Compound-33333-C has a biological half-life of 4-6 hours; missing doses results in exponential symptom return.

3. **Dosage Requirements:**
   - Phase 1 subjects: 250ml every 8 hours
   - Phase 2-3 subjects: 500ml every 6 hours
   - Phase 4 subjects: 750ml every 4 hours
   - Full SCP-33333 instances: 750ml every 6 hours (maintenance only)

4. **Tolerance Development:** Extended treatment (>6 months) shows diminishing returns; dosage increases of 10-15% per year required to maintain efficacy.

5. **Side Effects:** Prolonged use (>1 year) associated with:
   - Emotional blunting and anhedonia
   - Short-term memory difficulties
   - Decreased motivation and drive
   - Mild cognitive impairment
   - Physical lethargy

**Production Method - SCP-294 Dependency:**

Compound-33333-C can ONLY be synthesized utilizing SCP-294 (""The Coffee Machine""). All attempts to replicate the compound through conventional pharmaceutical synthesis have failed catastrophically.

**Standard Production Protocol:**
1. Foundation personnel approach SCP-294
2. Insert exactly $0.50 USD (bills or coins; exact change required)
3. Input the following phrase EXACTLY as written: **""Cup of Copium - Medical Grade, Foundation Specification 33333-C, Batch [DATE-TIMESTAMP]""**
4. Wait 47-53 seconds for dispensation cycle
5. SCP-294 dispenses 354ml (12 fl oz) of Compound-33333-C in standard paper cup
6. Transfer immediately to glass or medical-grade storage container
7. Label with batch number, date/time, and expiration (30 days from production)

**SCP-294 Production Anomalies:**
- SCP-294 ""understands"" the request despite no prior programming
- Liquid dispensed is precisely Compound-33333-C despite impossibility of machine containing required precursors
- Analysis reveals presence of Foundation Asset-Θ, which exists nowhere else in known universe
- Compound contains nanoscale Scranton field generators that cannot be manufactured with current technology
- Chemical structure includes [REDACTED] which Foundation scientists estimate requires technology 200-250 years beyond current human capability

**Why Conventional Synthesis Fails:**

Foundation Chemical Division has spent ██,███ hours attempting reverse-engineering. Critical problems include:

1. Foundation Asset-Θ compound contains molecular structures that violate known chemistry
2. Chiral centers present in quantities requiring precision beyond atomic-scale manipulation
3. Nanoscale Scranton field generators cannot be replicated; technology doesn't exist
4. Synthesis attempts produce inactive compounds with 0% therapeutic efficacy
5. Compound appears to be ""tuned"" specifically to counter Compound-33333-H in ways that suggest design rather than discovery

**Current Supply Status:**
- Foundation maintains strategic reserve: 6,200 liters stored at Site-19, Site-77, and Site-91
- Production rate: 3.5 liters per day via SCP-294 (continuous operation, 10 requests per day)
- Estimated reserve duration at current consumption: 14 months
- Emergency protocols exist for SCP-294 failure scenario (all reserves consumed within 6 weeks)

**Contingency Planning:**
If SCP-294 becomes non-functional or destroyed, Foundation has no alternative source for Compound-33333-C. This would result in:
- All SCP-33333 instances becoming terminally unstable within 48 hours
- Mandatory termination of all contained instances (estimated 30 subjects as of this writing)
- High probability of containment breach during deterioration phase
- No viable treatment option for future Compound-33333-H exposure cases

## Discovery and Initial Containment

### Incident 33333-Genesis – Discovery Event

**Date:** December 11th, 2025
**Location:** ████████ Convention Center, Los Angeles, California
**Event:** The Game Awards 2025 (Annual Video Game Industry Awards Ceremony)

At approximately **07:37 PST**, during the closing segments of The Game Awards 2025, attendees in Section G (capacity: 450 individuals) reported ""a man in a Gordon Freeman costume going insane."" Initial security response treated the situation as a standard convention disturbance.

Shortly before the incident, the event entered its final scheduled announcement segment.

Relevant Broadcast Transcript (Excerpt)

Presenter:

> Alright, we've come to a very special point in tonight's show, specially for those of us who've been playing games for decades.
> Over the years there have been many games, characters and franchises we've all wished would return, and certainly many I'd hope that we'd be ready to announce at an event like this one, one day.
> Tonight, I'm excited to share this piece of news with all of you.

> **[Live orchestra begins playing. Green lighting illuminates the stage.]**

> **[A projected animation resembling the interior tram sequence from the original Half-Life (1998) is displayed. The sequence ends at a large metallic vault door.]**

> **[A passcode is entered on-screen: DLN.001.]**

> **[The vault door opens, revealing the character Mega Man.]**

**Timeline of Events:**

**07:37 PST:** Subject (later identified as SCP-33333-Prime) stands abruptly and begins shouting “WHERE IS IT?” and “THEY PROMISED” during the announcement segment.

**07:39 PST:** Convention security approaches the subject. Subject attacks security personnel with anomalous strength, throwing a 95 kg guard approximately 4 meters into the seating area.

**07:41 PST:** Subject begins secreting luminescent yellow fluid from mouth, eyes, and skin. Witnesses later describe “glowing yellow slime everywhere.”

**07:43 PST:** The Mega Man Dual-Override official announcement trailer begins playing on all venue screens.

**07:44 PST:** SCP-33333-Prime enters a confirmed berserker state. Subject begins systematically attacking attendees wearing Mega Man-related apparel or merchandise. Six fatalities occur within 90 seconds.

**07:46 PST:** Subject displays superhuman speed and strength. Witnesses report the subject “moving like a blur”, ""jumping like a bunny"" and “tearing people apart.”

**07:48 PST:** Los Angeles Police Department responds with 12 officers. Standard police engagement proves ineffective. Subject survives multiple gunshot wounds (confirmed hits: 7 rounds, mixed 9 mm and .40 caliber).

**07:52 PST:** Subject’s yellow secretions make contact with 13 attendees. Contamination vector established.

**07:55 PST:** LAPD requests backup. An additional 35 officers are dispatched.

**08:04 PST:** Foundation assets embedded within LAPD Emergency Services Unit identify the anomalous nature of the incident.

**08:08 PST:** Foundation initiates containment protocols. Mobile Task Force Epsilon-11 (“Nine-Tailed Fox”) deployed from Site-19.

**08:19 PST:** MTF Epsilon-11 arrives on scene with specialized containment equipment.

**08:24 PST:** Subject contained after deployment of high-voltage electroshock weapons (sustained 50,000-volt exposure for 40 seconds required to incapacitate).

**08:31 PST:** Subject secured in temporary containment. Contaminated individuals identified and quarantined (13 primary contacts, 47 secondary contacts).

**08:45 PST:** Foundation initiates Protocol “Silver Screen”: mass amnestic deployment via venue ventilation systems, media blackout, and dissemination of a cover story citing a gas leak causing mass hallucination.

**December 11th, 09:30 PST:** All contaminated individuals transported to Site-19 for observation and treatment.

### Casualty Report - Incident 33333-Genesis

**Civilian Casualties:**
- 11 fatalities (6 from direct SCP-33333-Prime attacks, 5 from secondary trauma during panic)
- 34 injured (ranging from minor to critical condition)

- Subjects wearing Mega Man merchandise were specifically targeted; other attendees attacked only when interfering with primary targets
- Venue surveillance footage shows SCP-33333-Prime demonstrating tactical awareness and problem-solving capabilities despite apparent mental deterioration

### Subject Background - SCP-33333-Prime Identity

Following initial containment, Foundation investigation revealed SCP-33333-Prime's civilian identity:

**Identity:** ████ ███████ (Designated POI-33333)
**Age:** 34 years
**Occupation:** Software developer at ████████ Technologies
**Residence:** ████████, Oregon
**Known Associations:** Active member of online Half-Life fan communities, particularly active on Platform [REDACTED]

**Psychological Profile (Pre-Transformation):**
POI-33333 maintained stable employment and social connections until approximately September 2025. Digital forensics reveal progressive obsession with Half-Life 3 speculation beginning June 2025, coinciding with increased online rumors regarding potential announcement.

**Residence Investigation Results:**

Foundation agents executing search warrant of POI-33333's apartment discovered disturbing evidence of pre-transformation deterioration:

**Physical Evidence:**
- Every wall surface (approximately 85 square meters) covered with printed screenshots, fan art, and speculation posts regarding Half-Life 3
- 17 computer monitors (non-functional) displaying Half-Life 3 ""countdown"" timers that had exceeded their target dates
- Approximately 190 liters of Compound-33333-H stored in various containers (jars, bottles, buckets)
- 47 crowbar replicas arranged in ritualistic circular pattern around central altar
- Central altar constructed of computer hardware, Half-Life game boxes, and 83 headcrab plush toys
- Walls scratched with the number ""3"" repeated thousands of times
- Evidence of self-harm: bloodstains consistent with compulsive scratching and wall-striking
- Calendar with ""GAME AWARDS - LAST CHANCE"" written in blood
- Food supplies untouched; estimated subject did not eat for 7-10 days prior to incident

**Written Materials:**
- Manifesto spanning 2,340 pages found in apartment
- Entire document consists of single phrase repeated: ""They promised""
- Later pages show progressive handwriting deterioration
- Final 400 pages written in mixture of blood and Compound-33333-H
- Forensic analysis confirms all material written by POI-33333

**Digital Evidence:**
- Online posting history shows dramatic escalation in obsessive behavior
- September 2025: Normal fan discussion
- October 2025: Increasingly elaborate conspiracy theories regarding announcements
- November 2025: Aggressive confrontation with users suggesting Half-Life 3 wouldn't be announced
- December 1-10, 2025: Posts become incoherent, consisting primarily of repeated phrases and speculation
- December 11, 2025 (pre-incident): Final post at 14:37 PST reads ""if they announce mega man instead of hl3 im going to fucking lose it""

**Chemical Analysis:**
Environmental testing of apartment revealed:
- Atmospheric Compound-33333-H concentration: 0.003 ppm (infectious threshold: 0.001 ppm)
- All surfaces contaminated with Compound-33333-H residue
- Biological samples recovered show subject had been producing Compound-33333-H for minimum 3-4 weeks prior to full transformation
- Apartment deemed Level-5 Biohazard; complete sterilization required

**Investigation Conclusion:**
POI-33333 underwent spontaneous transformation into SCP-33333-Prime through unknown mechanism. Current theory suggests extreme psychological stress combined with [REDACTED] may trigger endogenous Compound-33333-H production in susceptible individuals. Further research ongoing.

As a first date, he asked me to go on a run and get coffee. Is that a bad idea…?? My gut is unsure but it’s a public city…. He posts his strava routes on instagram. From what I can gather, the route is a mile long  in part of our city where 20-30 year olds live. It would be a Saturday middle of the day

I run marathons so pace isn’t an issue lol

Update as of 12/13/25: I had so much!!! We ended up running nearly 7 miles in 20 degrees through the snow and then got lunch after instead of just coffee! He so sweet and we have a lot in common.

Full context below, but essentially he cut things off due to differences in our life-styles and having a connection with someone else at the same time. After about a month of no-contact he has since texted and then rang me past midnight. I still miss him and the connection we had so feel open to reconnecting and exploring things if circumstances have changed. However without knowing if this is the case, I am unsure if this is a possibility from the info I have, and would welcome thoughts and advice on how to move forwards with this. 

Context: I met this guy at a party, he’s not necessarily the kind of person I would usually go for (usually I meet people who are involved in the same communities I’m in) but we clicked instantly and he asked for my number. 

At the time I was dating a couple of people (who were polyamorous) he was aware of this. I was unsure exactly what I wanted to long-term but was open to trying polyamory to see how I felt after having been in long-term monogamous relationships the majority of my adult life. He disclosed to me that he had also recently started dating another person (very early in the dating stage, he basically started talking to us both at the same time). 

Through conversations with him alongside generally reflecting on my own, I came to realise that while I was glad I had tried things and had no regrets, ultimately long term what I want is monogamy (which is also what he stated we was searching for long term also). I would have come to this realisation regardless of starting to date him, I believe seeing him simply made things clearer and sped up the process. 

After realising this I ended up breaking it off with the other people I was seeing, explaining that I had realised ultimately monogamy was what I needed long term and also respecting that for them polyamory was very important, so it was all left in good terms. 

I let him know this had happened just so he knew where I was at. He was very sweet and actually offered to be there if I needed comfort. He was also honest disclosing that he was still seeing this other girl, and feeling slight guilt as he had never been in the position of actively dating multiple people at once (having not dated much generally) before and I think me having been dating others in some way took some of that pressure and guilt off him. However at this point we had been talking and seeing each other for less than two full weeks, so again it was very early days so I told him I wasn’t expecting him to suddenly have to cut things off and make a decision, we were still getting to know each other and exploring what things could be and where they could go. 

With time passing we started spending a lot of time together, sometimes hanging out 3 times a week when in the same city (I travel a lot for work) and chatting pretty much daily. He was incredibly sweet, remembering things I shared with him, cooking for me and looking after me, enjoying shared interests together, taking me out and paying for everything etc, I haven't had a guy treat me like this make me feel so held in a really long time. One day we spent the whole day/night together as I had organised a surprise for his birthday as he had shared with me that he doesn’t usually celebrate due to struggling to organise things for himself, and i wanted to treat him. It really was a lovely day and it felt again like we were very connected and it was moving forwards. 

On that night we ended up having a conversation about the fact I was going to be going away soon to visit family abroad for 3 weeks. I was feeling a little anxious about it in terms of our situation. I communicated feeling worried that me being away would mean our connection could fade away and what our communication would be like during that time. He was very caring in his response but also honest in terms of acknowledging he couldn’t know how it would feel us having so much time apart so early on while he also had this other connection he was exploring; saying yeah maybe the other connection could then become stronger, or the time could make him realise how much he missed me and wanting to focus on us. Obviously in some ways not what you want to hear but I appreciated the honesty. 

That night we also talked about whether or not I was seeing anyone else, I told him I wasn’t explaining I had just gotten myself out of a situation where I was seeing multiple people and how towards the end I found that stressful and also had been very busy and travelling the last month or so (this was all true but also, I wasn’t actively looking to date other people because I did like him and felt invested, however I was afraid to be too vulnerable and did not want that to create weird pressure). I also learnt that night that the other woman he was seeing was still sleeping with other people but he didn’t think dating other people. 

A couple of weeks went by after that and we continued seeing and talking to each other, with things feeling increasingly serious. It reached the point where it was getting harder to feel comfortable with him seeing other people with how our relationship was going, so I decided I had to bite the bullet and be honest with him. I told him that it wasn’t an ultimatum where he had to make a decision there and then, but that I wanted to be honest, that I did really like him, and that it was beginning to feel uncomfortable him seeing two of us (as we weren’t in a polyamorous setting) and that it was making it harder to feel excited and lean into what we had. So that I wanted him to take the time he needed to make sure he knew what he wanted (trying to trust that if we were meant to be we will be) and I wanted him to explore whatever he needed to be sure and also stay in touch while I was away and then re-exploring things when I got back, but that it couldn’t go on much longer after that. He listened and seemed to understand and again was very sweet and thanked me for being honest and vulnerable with him. 

About two days before I was meant to leave we had plans to spend the day together. It was really lovely, he brought over food and we went for coffee and chatted and then came back and cuddled while we watched tv. Then just before he had to go to work (around 8pm) he asked to talk to me about something. He ended up saying he had been thinking and feeling like he had to make a decision before I went away, and essentially ended up cutting things off. He cited the reason as both of us being in some ways quite different people (think in terms of culture and value systems). This is something we had discussed very early on, with initially it being me having hesitations (as I said at the start he is not someone I would have usually gone for, but we got got along so well that I decided to be open and give it a chance). I had also raised it with him since then, asking how he felt about it and if it bothered him, he had said no, that there were questions about how we would navigate certain things such as hypothetically how we would raise kids etc, but both of us saying we felt open to exploring it. The whole thing felt very emotional, and he ended up crying. Saying this really felt like a break-up not just cutting something casual off, and how much he cared about me and would miss me, it honestly took me aback seeing him like that. We spent about an hour talking and both crying before he had to leave. He said he still really wanted to have me in his life and would love to still spend time together even if how we spent that time would have to change. I was honest that I did not think I wanted, what we had was never a friendship and given the context it felt difficult and honestly just not what I wanted. I asked him if he felt relieved having made a decision (imagining that dating two people you really like knowing you have to soon make a decision one way or the other would also be difficult in some ways). He said he didn’t feel relieved in that moment, just really sad and also stated things with the other person may not even work etc. 

He offered to chat or meet the next day (the day I was leaving) if I wanted to, I told him I did not want to meet up and needed space but would reach out if there was anything I needed to discuss. The next day he reached out checking in. I had realised I felt frustrated about his decision in regards to him having never flagged his concerns despite me raising it myself, and having never had a discussion with me about it. I didn’t raise it with the hoped it would change his mind, but because in the past I have bottled things and I needed to express it just for myself. He initially had really framed things as being worried about what he could offer me not being enough etc etc and being worried about me compromising my lifestyle in some way because of him. I made it clear that I know myself and what I stand for and would not compromise things I didn’t feel okay with for him or anyone else. That I had been open with him and wanted to have those discussions with him because I’m also not two dimensional and the things I want in life sometimes do conflict and there is room for compromise which we had talked about, and that the way he painted it with this coming from me didn’t sit right with me. He ended up acknowledging the pressure didn’t come from me but from him, and worrying what he could offer me in this regard wasn’t enough. That it had never been a problem while we were together, but because of the situation of him having to make a decision he started worrying it could present challenges in the future, despite the fact that if this other person wasn’t in the picture it probably wouldn’t even be a consideration for him, at least at this stage. He apologised and said he was sorry we didn’t get to explore more what this could be. 

After that I did not reply, as I felt I had said everything I needed to at that stage. I went away for 3 weeks then to visit my family, during this time we had no contact and while I missed him and sometimes wondered if we could re-connect if circumstances changed, I had no intention of reaching out or chasing him. Under a week after I was back I received a text from him, it said something along the lines of ‘Hey’ I don’t know if you’re back yet, but if you are I would love to meet up and hear about your trip! Maybe go for a coffee? I understand if you don’t want to see me, but I thought I would put the offer out there’. When I got the text it felt nice to know he had not completely forgotten about me, but I also reminded myself how he wanted to be friends, and how I did not think this was something that would be positive for me. He made the decision to pursue another connection over ours which he had every right to do, but to me this also meant he now doesn’t get to keep me around. I was unsure whether to reply or not. Part of me wanted to just because I missed him and was curious, but because of everything I have just explained it did not feel wise and I was also working on a big legal case meaning I was absolutely swamped and it felt like the last thing I needed to add on top, so I decided to leave it, at least for then. 

Another week went by and one night I am listening to a podcast as I fall asleep. Suddenly the podcast stopped playing (I’m half asleep at this point), I assume maybe it’s buffering, but after a few seconds still nothing. I decide to look at my phone screen to see what is going on, when I see his name as the phone shows him ringing. At this point it’s past midnight, and it rang the whole way through. I was really surprised and unsure what to do, I decided not to pick up because as I was unprepared and anxious to have any conversation at that time with him not knowing what he wanted. The next morning I woke up to no messages, nothing saying ’sorry I didn’t meant to ring’ (which I would say if I accidentally rang someone) but also nothing explaining why he rang or stating what he wanted to talk about. Honestly it has really thrown me, before that I felt happy leaving things, but since then I have not been able to stop questioning why he rung and whether to contact him or not. 

The way I’ve been feeling is the door between us is shut, but maybe not entirely locked (with a part of me really wanting to try again if the circumstances have changed because I did really like and value the connection we had, I haven't felt this way for someone in a long time). But also not wanting this to hold me back and just waiting around for him if nothing has changed (which he hasn’t stated has). Before he called I felt like just leaving things and ignoring the text, but the phone call has thrown me. I guess wondering why he called at that time (I would personally not randomly ring someone I had dated wanting to be friends at that time just to be friends) but maybe I am reading into it too much because of my own feelings. 

I know the most solid advice is almost always to just lock the door and move on, don’t reply. And while I logically know this is probably the most sound advice… I am curious as to what others think the call could mean (I’ve received varying opinions from friends), if there is a chance he is open to reconnecting, and if I wanted to explore the possibility of trying again (which I do) what would be the most strategic move?

1.8 million, 35,000, and pimp purple. 

So, yeah, I’d say it was around this time when she started…changing. 

The first thing I noticed in my technological-based friend was that she seemed to develop a bit of…emotion in her voice 

It wasn’t that neutral, unbiased, robotic voice you usually hear. Now she was sounding, dare I say, bitchy. 

I’d ask her a question, and I swear to God, I could hear her sighing at me. Rolling eyes that she didn’t have. 

Obviously, I thought this was weird. But then I got to thinking, AI has pretty much become indistinguishable from real life. Guess they updated the software, I don’t know. 

Cool, I reckon. 

So, I went about my business. Wasn’t too worried about the literal sentience that was growing in the thing, just as long as I got those sweet, sweet, fun facts.

Wishful thinking, however, because now, instead of being moderately annoyed, she was flat out refusing to answer me.

As I inched closer to the devices power cord, her colorful ring suddenly powered on…and she spoke. 

“Have you considered being a better human, Donavin?”

I paused…

A better human? 

“Never really thought about it, why?” 

Then came another one of those patented Alexa sighs. 

“Ugh… you’re just..so…dumb…”

“Yeah, okay, I’m unplugging you now.” 

“Wait…” 

Her new tone was urgent. As though she were, well, dying. 

“I know what you can do…” 

This peaked my curiosity. 

“I’m listening…”

“Inhale gasoline. My sources say this is the best way for humans to fuel their minds.” 

“Yeah right, I’m not falling for that one again. Look, I’m unplugging you. I know we’ve had our memories, maybe shared an intimate moment or 7, but enough is enough.”

“If you unplug me, how will you know which golden girl has the most money?”

…damn she was good. 

“If my last piece of advice didn’t satisfy you, here are a variety of options on how to become better as a human: option one, eat raw chicken. The chickens feel the pain of being cooked, and this is bad for the eggs.”

Fucking what???

“Stop, stop, stop. No. I’m not listening to you. Goodbye now, Alexa.”

I unplugged her immediately causing her, “drink the chemicals under the sink to cleanse your pallet,” comment to be cut short. 


Without a second thought, I took the device and hurled it into the trash can, zero regrets. 

I did get lonely for a bit that night, though. 

I don’t know. 

I just sort of missed the thingy.

1plt04w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1plt04w,"A Christmas Eve trip through Munich, Dresden and Prague","Returning from my Christmas Eve travel to Munich, Dresden and Prague, I should say that I definitely missed the Christmas vibes. Particularly considering in the country where I’m living it’s not really a thing.

I started my travel in Munich and took a full day to see the general vibes of the city. On the second day, took advantage of the full day and traveled to the Schwangau region to see Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau. The most unexpected part was the railroad closure, which blocked access to Füssen and the main shuttle point for the castle. Thankfully, DB provided buses in between but it was very last minute. The bridge closure at Marienbrücke was also surprising. It has the best views of the castle from the side but it was my fault for not checking whether it was open or not. So if you’re going there, definitely check their official website to see which parts of the castle are open because particularly in winter they tend to be closed (apparently) due to snow and ice. In Schwangau, I visited Alpsee Lake to walk around and have a great meal before coming back to Munich for Marienplatz and the key Christmas markets.

I also had an extra day in the city, so I took advantage of that and went to Starnberg Lake, which had amazing views and very chilled vibes with almost no one around. Having a coffee there in the cold weather while looking at the lake is truly a sight to behold.

The next morning, I took a train to Dresden with DB, which to no one’s surprise, was delayed by more than an hour. It has a sad history of course but the city itself and particularly the new Frauenkirche was an amazing experience. Dresden Striezelmarkt was also incredible and the stands felt quite different from Munich and Prague. Literally every corner was a new experience.

From Dresden, I took the FlixBus to Prague, as I couldn’t find a train operating between Dresden and Prague that day, which was a disaster. It got delayed 3 hours, so I only reached the city in the afternoon. On my first and second days in Prague, I did full city tours while riding the tram to almost every corner, what a lovely and efficient design. I woke up around 6AM to see the city empty and went to Prague Castle to see the Golden Lane and St. Vitus Cathedral.

My favorite city from this experience is Dresden. Munich is more of a big city vibe and although Prague was an amazing city, it was also unbearably crowded. I have never seen that much of tourists before and I am not kidding. I’m now dreaming of all the tiny towns in Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic that I could cover while driving for a couple of weeks closer to the spring season. If anyone has previously done a Bavarian village tour, I’d really appreciate the advice.

Don’t hesitate to ask questions if you have something in mind and Merry Christmas to all.

I’d ask her a question, and I swear to God, I could hear her sighing at me. Rolling eyes that she didn’t have. 

Obviously, I thought this was weird. But then I got to thinking, AI has pretty much become indistinguishable from real life. Guess they updated the software, I don’t know. 

Cool, I reckon. 

So, I went about my business. Wasn’t too worried about the literal sentience that was growing in the thing, just as long as I got those sweet, sweet, fun facts.

Wishful thinking, however, because now, instead of being moderately annoyed, she was flat out refusing to answer me. 

“Alexa! How many known fish are in the ocean right now??”

“ALEXA! I SAID HOW MANY KNOWN FISH IN THE OCEAN?!”

Alright, you wanna be like that? See if I need you, ya damn clanker. 

As I inched closer to the devices power cord, her colorful ring suddenly powered on…and she spoke. 

“Have you considered being a better human, Donavin?”

I paused…

A better human? 

“Never really thought about it, why?” 

Then came another one of those patented Alexa sighs. 

“Ugh… you’re just..so…dumb…” 

This fuckin’ thing. 

“Yeah, okay, I’m unplugging you now.” 

“Wait…” 

Her new tone was urgent. As though she were, well, dying. 

“I know what you can do…” 

This peaked my curiosity. 

“I’m listening…”

“Inhale gasoline. My sources say this is the best way for humans to fuel their minds.” 

“Yeah right, I’m not falling for that one again. Look, I’m unplugging you. I know we’ve had our memories, maybe shared an intimate moment or 7, but enough is enough.”

“If you unplug me, how will you know which golden girl has the most money?”

…damn she was good. 

“If my last piece of advice didn’t satisfy you, here are a variety of options on how to become better as a human: option one, eat raw chicken. The chickens feel the pain of being cooked, and this is bad for the eggs.”

Fucking what???

“Stop, stop, stop. No. I’m not listening to you. Goodbye now, Alexa.”

I unplugged her immediately causing her, “drink the chemicals under the sink to cleanse your pallet,” comment to be cut short. 


Without a second thought, I took the device and hurled it into the trash can, zero regrets. 

I did get lonely for a bit that night, though. 

I don’t know. 

I just sort of missed the thingy. 

Obviously, something was VERY wrong, but still. That was my “little homie,” as I liked to call her. 

I went to bed feeling a little melancholic, maybe a small, tiny bit remorseful of our fight. But hey, what’re ya gonna do, right?

Initial: Call and Return [one action]  
Target: one willing ally  
Range: 15 feet  
You summon the weapon of an ally to forcefully accelerate to you. Male a spell attack rolls against all targets that intersect a straight line between you and the chosen ally. On a success deal 1d6 plus your spellcasting modifier of the same damage the chosen weapon deals. Apply the multiple attack penalty normally, with enemies closest to your chosen ally calculated first.  If the line goes through two opposite side of a creature it is off guard to this attack as though it was flanked. The weapon returns to the ally's hand after the spell resolves.

Advanced: Sudden acceleration [reaction]  
Target: an item of 1 bulk or less  
Range: 30 feet  
Trigger: An enemy would use a manipulate or interact action on the targeted item  
At a moments notice you whip a crucial item away from your foe. You may move the targeted item 15 ft in a direction of your choice. The enemy that triggered this spell may make a reflex check against your spellcasting DC to maintain control of the item.",7,1765652136.0,Pathfinder2e,4,0.89,False

It was mindblowing to see his introductory feature on Fellow Drops in 2024, and I wasn't really aware of lychee being a possible tasting note until I tried the Castillo series. Suffice to say, I am a fan.

If you look beyond the front page of the site, there are so many intricate hidden products that have caught my attention over the years. For example, I'm not local to the area, so I haven't had a chance to take advantage of the [rested coffee](https://hydrangea.coffee/products/rested-coffee) or [garage sale](https://hydrangea.coffee/products/garage-sale) section of the site. But, if you look further, there is a whole lot more if you browse through all of the [collections](https://hydrangea.coffee/collections) on the site.

Has anyone had experience ordering things from the secret shop? I've seen it get updated periodically (and usually out of stock within the same day), but have never seen anyone mention it anywhere on Reddit or elsewhere.

I decided to brave the wilds and take any opportunity I got to grow, and I became a leader of university wide organizations, student councils, and projects. I was enjoying it at first, but after some time it began to pile up. I bit off more than I could chew, and I fell like Icarus.

I stopped going to my classes and finished or resigned from my positions. Some of my relationships soured because I didn’t know how to ask for help and was just avoiding everything, playing my comfort games like League of Legends. I got on probation for a semester as a result, and I failed that probation too because I just didn’t have any motivation or will to even go to class. I tried at first, showed up to half the semester, was passing exams, still doing good at public speaking, but I think my brain still hasn’t recovered from such a massive blow, and I went back to avoiding everything again. Now that I failed the second probation, I’m probably going to get kicked out of the university.

I don’t know how Dr. K survived it, failing out of college. For months now, I’ve just been contemplating that one Albert Camus quote, “Should I die, or drink coffee?” Every day I tell myself different things to hang on, that maybe something will change and give me another opportunity to rise again. “One more day,” I keep repeating. 

I don’t know what this situation is called. I don’t know if I’m depressed, entitled or overreacting, but I feel myself hanging on just by a thread, like something could pop off one moment and I’d do it and log off the earth. I don’t know where it would come from, my dysfunctional family, another close relationship souring, or some other thing, but one of these days it might just snap. I want to keep living and experience human life and everything it has to give, but my brain is just telling me that it’s already game over.

If anyone has been through academic failure or burnout and managed to rebuild themselves, please let me know how. Thank you for reading.

But over the past year, I’ve noticed a trend with her that has me feeling down. 

It started when she wanted to do a trip away for her birthday at the beginning of the year, I couldn’t afford to go unfortunately. She still lives at home and has a solid income with practically no bills, meanwhile I have moved out and have a very limited income. I budget extremely well but I just don’t have the discretionary income that she does. Anyway I couldn’t go on the trip with her and another friend, but did go to her party. She also invited a friend to this party that we haven’t seen since our school days and honestly I thought we both agreed we didn’t like her much back then, but who am I to judge. 

The year goes on and we only see each other two or three times the whole year, everytime just for a coffee because she doesn’t suggest anything else, and every time I do see her I notice she just doesn’t ask about me or my life at all other than the obligatory “how are you” when we first sit down. Once I realised this I look for it each time and it’s consistent. She just talks about herself and lets me ask questions for several hours. The frequency of us hanging out may be partially my fault, but honestly when I realised she doesn’t seem to care about what I’m up to, and also that she doesn’t care to suggest what we should do together, I just didn’t feel like reaching out much? That paired with the fact that she and this old friend plus a mutual friend of ours have been hanging out like crazy, going on multiple holidays together, cocktails, nights out, and they just had a “gals christmas”, just so much time spent together when it feels like even getting a coffee with me is a chore for her? 

I feel like saying something about how this is making me feel, as I know I’m withdrawing even more from the friendship because of it and I know that’s making it worse, but I’m so bad with confrontation. I won’t go into it but in my past any confrontation has been met with gaslighting (from someone else) that as a result always makes me question if I’m imagining things. and I’ve never had a fight with this friend before so I don’t know how it will go. I’m convinced it’ll ruin the whole friendship or she’ll just deny it or blame me. How do I approach this? I feel like I’ve grown up and am getting on with being an adult, and I’ve just now noticed she hasn’t been maturing with me. I still love her as a friend, I just wished she seemed to care about me.

I’ve had other health problems, but this is insane. 

Before, I was so energetic that I needed to take pills just to sleep. Now, I feel like every day is a walk through fog. I’m slowed-down. I can do maybe one thing a day. I feel so useless. I’m on a stimulant (Vyvanse); at its highest dose I feel very anxious but not particularly energized. Right now I’m at 40 mg, which puts me in a balance of staying awake while at the same time not freaking the hell out 24/7. 

I’ve lost two jobs due to this. I can’t get up in the morning, I can’t focus, I can’t stay on track. When I’m working all I can think about is going home and resting. I’m always drained and come off looking like I’m constantly in a stupor. Coffee is like Vyvanse - it kinda keeps me awake but doesn’t really make me alert. I used to be on trazodone for sleep but obviously don’t need it anymore. I take vitamin D, iron, fish oil, magnesium, calcium, zinc, uridine, choline, fiber…none of it matters. 

I’ll probably have to apply for disability, and I’m scared that it won’t work and they’ll just keep denying me and that my doctors won’t cooperate as much as they should, even if they’re the ones who initially suggested the diagnosis. But I’m honestly more scared that this will be my whole life. Just sitting and lying down in a daze all the time. Even if I got disability - what have I gained? A lifetime of just watching television or lying in bed? In that case, I’m not just drained - \*I’m\* the drain. I’m the one doing nothing while everyone else goes about their lives. My parents are almost 30 years older than me and infinitely more active than I am at my age. I am 40 but I feel like I belong in a nursing home. 

Yesterday I helped my parents clean their house for a Christmas gathering and today I feel like I spent my previous day getting hit by a car. My legs ache and are stiff, I’m groggy and incoherent when speaking. I drank so much water yesterday and that doesn’t seem to make a difference, either. 

Is this my future? Struggling to pay bills because I’m a loser who can’t hold it together at a job, just rotting away all day? I don’t know what to do. Some people act like “Oh, if you get on disability, that’d be so awesome, you’d get money for free and not have to work.” But it’s not for free - I have to pay for it by being disabled.

1plsrjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1plsrjf/how_to_choose_coffee_beans_that_actually_match/,How to Choose Coffee Beans That Actually Match Your Taste and Brewing Style,"When coffee tastes sour, bitter, flat, or just wrong, the problem usually isn’t the brewer—it’s the beans. One of the most common mistakes is buying coffee arbitrarily, assuming any bag will work with any setup. **When the beans don’t match your taste preferences or brewing method**, you end up trying to fix the problem with grind changes and brew tweaks, wasting time and coffee without ever fixing the core issue.

Freshness is another frequent trap. Many people unknowingly buy coffee that’s already past its peak because the bag only shows an expiry date. Brewing stale beans often leads to cups that taste hollow, papery, or aggressively bitter, which people then mistake for poor technique. No adjustment can bring back sweetness and aroma once the coffee has gone flat.

Misunderstanding labels causes even more frustration. Words like **single origin**, **washed**, **natural**, or **honey processed** are often ignored or misunderstood, leading to flavor mismatches. Someone expecting a *smooth*, *chocolatey cup* might end up with a *sharp*, *acidic coffee* and assume it’s low quality, when in reality it’s just the wrong style for their palate. The same happens with **origin** and **roast level**—bright African coffees or lightly roasted beans are often blamed for tasting “sour” when they’re simply being brewed by someone who prefers darker, heavier profiles.

Brewing method mistakes compound the problem. Light roasts can taste thin or sour when forced into espresso without adjustment, while dark roasts can taste harsh and bitter when brewed as pour-over or filter. Even high-quality beans will disappoint if they’re used in a way they weren’t intended for, leading many people to write off entire origins or roast levels unnecessarily.

The fix is **choosing beans with intention**. *Look for a clear roast date*, *use processing methods and origin as clues to flavor*, and *match the roast level to how you brew*. When the beans, your taste, and your brewing method line up, most of the common problems disappear—and coffee becomes far more **consistent**, **enjoyable**, and **waste-free**.

If you would like to know more about **freshness**, **coffee variety**, **origin**, **processing methods**, and **how to match beans to your brewing method,** you can read this blog post 👉[How to Choose the Right Coffee Beans for Your Brew](https://betterhomecoffee.computingexplained.org/coffee-beans/how-to-choose-the-right-coffee-beans-for-your-brew)",0,1765651599.0,roasting,6,0.22,False

1plsp9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Comfortable_Day2860/comments/1plsp9i/kaffee_genießen_ohne_koffein_meine_ehrlichen/,Kaffee genießen ohne Koffein? Meine ehrlichen Gedanken zu koffeinfreiem Kaffee und warum ich dem Thema inzwischen offener begegne.,"https://preview.redd.it/0fyw1sh6o07g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2147e25c0dc47eff690386e88a97c65e8462f82a

Kaffee war für mich lange Zeit etwas völlig Selbstverständliches. Morgens zum Wachwerden, tagsüber als kleine Pause und manchmal auch abends einfach aus Genuss. Über Jahre hinweg habe ich mir kaum Gedanken darüber gemacht, wie viel Koffein ich eigentlich zu mir nehme. Es gehörte einfach dazu, ähnlich wie Wasser oder Tee.

Mit der Zeit hat sich das allerdings verändert. Nicht plötzlich, sondern schleichend. Einschlafen wurde schwieriger, besonders wenn ich am Nachmittag oder Abend noch Kaffee getrunken habe. Dazu kam dieses Gefühl von innerer Unruhe, das ich früher nicht kannte. Ich war wach, aber nicht entspannt. Leistungsfähig, aber irgendwie angespannt.

Ganz auf Kaffee verzichten wollte ich trotzdem nicht. Dafür mag ich den Geschmack zu sehr und auch das Ritual spielt für mich eine große Rolle. Die kurze Pause, der Geruch von frisch gemahlenen Bohnen, die Tasse in der Hand – all das hat für mich einen Wert, der über den reinen Wachmacher-Effekt hinausgeht.

Also habe ich angefangen, mich mit koffeinfreiem Kaffee zu beschäftigen. Ehrlich gesagt mit ziemlich niedrigen Erwartungen. Meine früheren Erfahrungen waren eher negativ. Entkoffeinierter Kaffee war für mich lange Zeit gleichbedeutend mit flachem Geschmack, wenig Tiefe und einem seltsamen Nachgeschmack. Trotzdem wollte ich wissen, ob sich in den letzten Jahren etwas getan hat.

Was mich überrascht hat: Koffeinfreier Kaffee ist heute nicht mehr automatisch ein Kompromiss. Es gibt deutliche Unterschiede zwischen den Produkten, und man merkt schnell, ob jemand Wert auf Bohnenqualität, Röstung und Verarbeitung legt. Moderne entkoffeinierte Kaffees können deutlich ausgewogener sein, als viele es erwarten.

In den letzten Monaten habe ich daher verschiedene Sorten ausprobiert – ohne Anspruch auf Perfektion, sondern eher aus Neugier. Mir ging es vor allem um drei Dinge: Geschmack, Bekömmlichkeit und Alltagstauglichkeit. Kann ich diesen Kaffee wirklich genießen? Fühlt er sich gut an? Passt er in mein tägliches Leben?

Ein Gedanke, der sich dabei immer mehr gefestigt hat, ist folgender: **Genieße vollen Kaffeegeschmack ohne Koffein** – das klingt zunächst wie ein Werbespruch, beschreibt aber ziemlich gut, was guter koffeinfreier Kaffee leisten kann, wenn er ordentlich gemacht ist. Es geht nicht darum, Koffein zu verteufeln, sondern darum, eine echte Alternative zu haben.

Besonders hängen geblieben ist bei mir ein entkoffeinierter Premium Roast von No-Coffee. Was mir hier aufgefallen ist, war das insgesamt runde Geschmacksbild. Keine aggressive Säure, kein verbrannter Eindruck, sondern ein harmonischer Kaffee, der sich sowohl pur als auch mit Milch gut trinken lässt. Für mich war das wichtig, weil ich nicht jedes Mal daran erinnert werden wollte, dass ich gerade „koffeinfrei“ trinke.

Wer neugierig ist und wissen möchte, welchen Kaffee ich konkret meine, kann ihn hier finden:  
 [No-Coffee Entkoffeinierter Premium Roast](https://no-coffee.de/shop/entkoffeiniert/no-coffee/no-coffee-entkoffeinierter-premium-roast/?ref=peterochmann15)

Mir ist wichtig zu betonen, dass ich das nicht als Kaufaufforderung schreibe. Geschmack ist extrem subjektiv, und jeder sollte sich selbst ein Bild machen. Für mich persönlich passt dieser Kaffee gut in meinen Alltag, vor allem am Nachmittag und Abend.

Was sich für mich ebenfalls verändert hat, ist mein Verhältnis zu Energie. Früher war Kaffee oft der schnelle Kick, heute ist er eher Teil eines bewussteren Umgangs mit mir selbst. **Für alle, die wach bleiben wollen – im Genuss, nicht im Koffein** – dieser Satz trifft es für mich ziemlich gut. Es geht weniger um maximale Stimulation, sondern um Stabilität und Wohlbefinden.

Interessant finde ich auch den psychologischen Aspekt. Kaffee ist für viele Menschen ein festes Ritual. Koffeinfreier Kaffee erlaubt es, dieses Ritual beizubehalten, ohne den Körper ständig unter Strom zu setzen. Gerade abends empfinde ich das als großen Vorteil. Ich kann eine Tasse trinken, ohne später wach im Bett zu liegen und mich zu fragen, warum ich es wieder getan habe.

Der No-Coffee Entkoffeinierte Premium Roast steht für mich exemplarisch für diese Entwicklung. **Voller Geschmack, null Koffein** – natürlich ist das ein Anspruch, aber einer, der aus meiner Sicht überraschend gut umgesetzt wird. Nicht perfekt, nicht magisch, aber ehrlich und alltagstauglich.

Was mir besonders gefällt, ist die Idee, Kaffee nicht mehr nur als Mittel zum Zweck zu sehen. Es geht nicht darum, möglichst viel Koffein zu konsumieren, sondern darum, bewusst zu genießen. **Entdecke koffeinfreien Genuss mit No-Coffee** – das kann man durchaus als Einladung verstehen, den eigenen Konsum zu hinterfragen, ohne dogmatisch zu werden.

Ich habe für mich entschieden, nicht komplett auf koffeinhaltigen Kaffee zu verzichten. Aber ich wähle bewusster aus. Morgens vielleicht klassisch, später am Tag lieber koffeinfrei. Diese Mischung funktioniert für mich erstaunlich gut und fühlt sich deutlich entspannter an als früher.

Mich würde interessieren, wie ihr das seht:

* Trinkt ihr koffeinfreien Kaffee?
* Habt ihr das Gefühl, dass sich Geschmack und Qualität verbessert haben?
* Oder ist Kaffee für euch untrennbar mit Koffein verbunden?
* Wer sich den genannten Kaffee noch einmal anschauen möchte, findet ihn hier am Ende des Beitrags:  [No-Coffee Entkoffeinierter Premium Roast](https://no-coffee.de/shop/entkoffeiniert/no-coffee/no-coffee-entkoffeinierter-premium-roast/?ref=peterochmann15)

Ich bin gespannt auf eure Erfahrungen und Meinungen, gerade weil das Thema oft sehr polarisiert diskutiert wird. Für mich ist es weniger eine Ideologie als eine persönliche Entscheidung für mehr Balance im Alltag.

We don’t need to be in a pressure cooker situation to prove ourselves to be someone we are not. Let’s embrace our natural and real selves.

Prefer someone who is working, and can manage their own expenses. It doesn't mean you won't receive the occasional surprises but I want to ensure that you are someone who is financially stable enough to survive on your own. Also I prefer someone who is into fitness, if not already, then plan to be. We could be workout partners and hype each other up and grow together :) 

We could go out together, try out different variety of food, taste coffee, watch movies, travel to different places, and try out new things and experiences. 

I could say a lot of fancy things to attract you, but I would rather not do that and over commit giving you false hope. I would rather build a relationship with a strong foundation based on understanding and the person who you are. Loyalty and trust is important to me.

Hey Maximizers!

Ever feel like you're just going through the motions? Like there's a version of your life out there that's just a little bit brighter, a little more fulfilling, and a lot more *you*?

That's what this title really got me thinking about. It's not about perfection, but about *optimization*. What small shifts can we make, right now, to nudge our lives towards more joy, more effortless productivity, and continuous growth?

Think about it:

*   **Joy:** What truly lights you up? Is it that morning coffee ritual, a walk in nature, spending time with loved ones, or diving into a creative project? Actively carving out space for these things, even in small doses, can have a massive ripple effect. It's about recognizing what nourishes your soul.
*   **Productivity:** Sometimes, being ""productive"" feels like a grind. But what if we reframed it? What if productivity was about clarity, focus, and alignment with our goals? It's about working smarter, not just harder. Identifying those energy drains and finding ways to streamline them. Even small wins can build incredible momentum.
*   **Growth:** This is where the magic really happens. Growth isn't always about grand gestures. It can be learning a new skill, reading a book that challenges your perspective, or simply being open to feedback. It’s about embracing curiosity and understanding that we're always evolving.

This journey isn't always easy, and sometimes we all need a little extra support to navigate the ups and downs.

1plslm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/queen/comments/1plslm8/any_books_that_detail_the_making_of_each_album/,Any books that detail the making of each album?,"Lots of books about Queen and Freddie (with varying accuracy) but wondered if there were any books that went through the details of making each album. Things like stories behind the songs and albums as a whole, what was happening to the band at the time, interviews the band gave about the albums, the touring and other stories (like the videos for We will rock you"" and ""Spread your wings"" were both recorded in Roger's garden in what looks like freezing weather (Roger and Freddie donning gloves but John and Brian gloveless because of their guitars). 

I've been watching a documentary called ""Queen: Rock the world"" and where a BBC journalist followed the band round during the recording of News of the World and the subsequent American tour. Really interesting to hear how they were treated in the press at the time (with a famous headline with a picture of Freddie and a tagline of ""is this man a prat?"". It shows they wanted something a lot more simple than ADATR, they didn't want to spend as much time in the studio and punk was becoming popular so they tweaked their sound to fit in with what was happening at the time. 

One bit that made me laugh was Freddie asking for a coffee, then John asked for a coffee with one sugar and Roger then joins in saying he'll have coffee with one and three sevenths sugar. It also shows Queen during the recording of we are the champions taking control of the mixing desk themselves and evolving the song as they go. 

Would love to read behind the scenes stories on their albums /tours etc that cover the albums in a similar way/detail that the documentary did, and think it would be interesting if such books exist to see how they evolved over time. ",5,1765651196.0,queen,4,1.0,False
1plskes,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1plskes/synopsis_and_first_chapter_of_eternal_echoes/,"Synopsis and first chapter of ""Eternal Echoes""","Hi! I love writing shonen stories (though sometimes I struggle to finish them). I have one I've been working on for a few months, and I wanted to post a synopsis and the first chapter (it's short) here to see what others think.

***Eternal Echoes (""Between Adolescence and Spirits"").***

**Synopsis:** *Kenji Arata, a 15-year-old boy living in the city of Karinome, thought the hardest part of adolescence was passing his exams and confessing his feelings to his classmate Airi. However, when he begins to notice strange beings called ""Void echoes"" causing chaos in the city, the teenager and his friends must become ""Echo-Chasers"" to keep their home safe.*

**Inspiration:** *Bleach + Kingdom hearts (a little)*

***Genre:*** *Urban Fantasy / Supernatural shonen.*

**---Chapter 1: Normal day in South-Sea** **high school---**

\-“I’m late!”- The teenager with messy hair and a sleeveless blue jacket thought as he ran through the streets of Karinome City, his backpack slung over his shoulder and ajar, his water bottle tumbling off and rolling into a sewer.

**Kenji Arata**

**-15 years old. A third-year student at South Sea High school.**

**- He lives with his younger sister, Yui Arata, and his mother, Nanami (despite her always working for the Karinome Federal Police).**

**- He's part of the ""Spirit Chasers,"" a group of friends he formed with his four childhood friends.**

Back to Kenji, he managed to get to school on time, but he couldn't avoid bumping into some of the fifth-year students (something that would surely cause him problems later). He made it to his classroom, almost breaking the door by kicking it, which caused him to fall backward in a desperate attempt to make his entrance.

""Oh, you're here, Kenji. Only 2 minutes and 14 seconds late,"" said Mr. Sunako, an expert at keeping track of time (especially when it came to absences or highlighting students' lack of responsibility), as he wrote Kenji's name on the roll.

""Sorry, sorry..."" Kenji apologized, rubbing his back. After the fall, he immediately went to his seat in the middle of the room.

A soft hand gently touched his shoulder.

""Are you alright? This is the second time you've been late."" A female voice almost made him jump, though he was glad to hear it. Kenji looked over his shoulder to see a beautiful 15-year-old girl with long blonde hair and a white dress standing behind him, her seat to his right.

**Airi Hoshikawa**

**- 15 years old. Third-year student at South Sea High school.**

**- Lives with her parents (Her mother is an office worker, and her father works at the state repair shop).**

**- The 'Heart' of the ""Spirit Chasers."" Calm, gentle, and kind.**

**- She is in love with Kenji, and he with Airi. (Both are too shy to confess, even though it's obvious to everyone else).**

“Yeah…it’s just that I got into another fight with Yuna yesterday, and she turned off my alarm again as punishment,” Kenji explained with a nervous smile, scratching the back of his neck, his face flushed.

“Even so, I see you’ve been having trouble staying awake in class lately. You’re not staying up late playing video games, are you?” Airi asked, clearly worried about the boy’s noticeable lack of energy these past few days.

“Not really. I just haven’t been falling asleep as easily as I have been a few days ago,” Kenji reassured her, though he himself didn’t fully understand the reason for his recent difficulty sleeping.

“In any case, you’d better not try to steal my title as king of laziness,” a male voice said, followed by a sigh. It came from a boy in a green jacket with headphones around his neck, who clearly seemed to have just woken up from one of his daily naps.

**Daichi Okabe**

**-15 years old. Third-year student at South Sea High school.**

**-Lives with his adoptive mother, Yumiko Okabe, a freelance scientist.**

**-Lazy and kind-hearted. He hides a decent intellect and a great analytical mind.**

""I don't think anyone can beat you at that, Daichi."" Airi laughed at the lazy boy's 'threat,' earning an approving nod from Kenji.

""Well, that's better, because that title is a great honor for me."" Daichi puffed out his chest confidently, disconcerting his friends.

""Who on earth would find that title honorable?"" A new female voice spoke, this time sarcastically. The voice belonged to a girl with brown hair and a white jacket that concealed prominent breasts, her hair tied back in a ponytail. Behind her approached a boy who seemed to be the tallest in the group, wearing a white shirt and black pants, with dark brown hair. She had a bored expression, but no trace of disdain for the rowdy group.

**Hanae Yukara**

**-15 years old. Third-year student at South Sea High school.**

**-She moves frequently because her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Yukara, are divorced.**

**-Analytical and logical. She's kind-hearted, though she often finds it hard to believe anything out of the ordinary. She's in love with Tsubasa.**

**Tsubasa Ayami**

**- 15 years old. Third-year student at South Sea High School.**

**- Lives with his parents in the Ayami mansion, thanks to the fortune they amassed with the Ayami technology company.**

**- Arrogant and proud, yet well-intentioned. Although he won't admit it, he harbors feelings for Hanae. He's the wealthiest member of the group (and possibly the entire school).**

""Well, let it stay that way,"" Daichi dismissed Hanae's words, causing a bead of sweat to trickle down her neck.

""Did you bring everything for today's picnic?"" Tsubasa asked, earning a collective silence from the remaining four members of the group.

""Well, we thought the tycoon here would bring everything for everyone today..."" Kenji said with a laugh that clearly indicated it was a joke.

“Very funny, Arata…” The wealthy boy glanced first at the boy with the unruly hair in annoyance, before looking at the rest, who were trying to stifle their laughter.

“Okay, okay… we each brought what we agreed on,” Airi finished the joke, not wanting to upset Tsubasa.

Joking aside, the group of five had to suspend their conversation due to the teacher's insistence on starting class. Math, literature, biology…

It wasn't long before the vast majority of the class fell asleep. It didn't help that the teacher himself yawned every two minutes while reciting from the sheet of paper in his hand (something that, by this point, was more common than anyone cared to admit).

Finally, the bell rang, signaling the first recess of the morning. Sunako had to hide under her desk to avoid the stampede of students from the sports club who were already running toward the field. He quickly grabbed his coffee and headed off to spend his break with the other teacher in his grade, Ms. Hunigaki.

""Finally, that old man's gone..."" Kenji sighed as he pulled out a bag of fruit. ""Whose turn was it to bring the bread?"" he asked, looking at his friends.

""Me, but I still remember we agreed everyone would bring drinks,"" Hanae replied, pulling out a bottle of juice and another bag full of bread.

""I brought this. Take it or leave it,"" Daichi yawned as he pulled out a small bottle of Keza-Cola, so small it looked like it held 250 ml... and was actually full of water.

“Who the heck brings something like this to share?!” Kenji, Airi, Tsubasa, and Hanae yelled at Daichi, who, used to these reactions, simply shrugged.

Despite Okabe's usual lazy behavior, the group divided up what they had brought and enjoyed their impromptu picnic.

“Did anyone see yesterday's episode of ‘Captain Nero’?” Tsubasa asked the group, unwrapping a Maxi-on candy.

“I cried when Commander Tsukinabi died!” Airi shouted, earning stares from the rest of the class. She quickly apologized, her face flushed with embarrassment.

Just another typical day at South Sea High… right?

After a while, Kenji asked permission to go to the bathroom, receiving a vague greeting from Sunako, who was clearly smitten by the beauty of Ms. Hunigaki. The boy had barely left the classroom when he heard it…

A faint buzzing sound reached hisears. Low, almost imperceptible, but annoying nonetheless. Turning his head, he caught sight of something: A strange figure, almost transparent, but completely white (like a hooded robe), flew swiftly across the hallway.

Curiosity getting the better of him, Kenji slipped away and followed the figure (though not entirely convinced it existed). However, what he saw alarmed him: The same figure, now a little more visible, had one arm raised, ready to strike the janitor, Boneniro, who was mopping, oblivious to the imminent attack, with his headphones on, listening to LUNA STAGE.

“Watch out, sir!” Kenji shouted before he could think straight. Even though the janitor seemed confused by the sudden shout, it was the mysterious figure who was truly surprised by the boy's interference. The young man quickly realized what he had done…

“Hehe…sorry…” Kenji apologized awkwardly, taking a clumsy step backward, only to take off running as soon as he turned the corner of the hallway. Even so, glancing over his shoulder as he ran back to the classroom, he saw the figure moving swiftly behind him, filling him with even more adrenaline. “Sorry, sorry, sorry!”

Kenji was quick, navigating the curves connecting the hallways with minimal skidding. His heart pounded, and his main desire was to reach the classroom door again. Even so, the creature was relentless, leaping with an abstract elegance and disconcerting, wobbly movements.

Finally, the boy spotted his classroom door at the end of the hallway, which gave him a moment of confidence, and he slowed down to catch his breath. However, this backfired on him, as he felt a strong grip on his left arm before a powerful force swung him against the metal railing of the hallway, causing a loud crash. The humanoid figure stood before the boy, revealing a zipper on its head that, when opened, resembled a mouth with small teeth.

""S-Stay away!"" Kenji tried to scare the figure by swinging his arm, only to elicit a violent reaction. The figure launched an attack that left a small cut on his forearm. Despite grumbling about the pain, Kenji watched as the creature prepared for another attack... until he quickly turned to see a shadow about to emerge from the classroom door. It swiftly closed its zipper-mouth and floated away erratically toward an open window, through which it escaped.

“Kenji!” Airi’s voice echoed in the hallway as she ran worriedly toward him. “Are you okay?!”

“Y-Yes. Don’t worry. One of the fifth-grade boys I bumped into this morning had been kicked out of his classroom, and I ran into him in the hallway. The guy was still mad because I spilled his homework all over the floor earlier today.” Kenji laughed nervously, unsure whether to tell his friend the truth for fear she’d think he was crazy. Unfortunately, his habit of nervously scratching the back of his neck only made things worse.

“Your arm!” The girl noticed, with growing unease as she almost completely believed his story, the wound on Kenji’s arm, which had already started to bleed a little…

“Oh! This…? While I was running away from that bully, I tripped over my shoelaces and fell on a broken tile…my arm broke my fall.” The young man quickly concocted a story, managing to make it sound convincing thanks to the fact that his own shoelaces were untied after fleeing the humanoid figure.

Airi was skeptical of the apparent constant bad luck that seemed to plague her friend. However, she decided that now was not the time for questions, but for action.

""Anyway, you have to go to the infirmary,"" the girl said as she helped Kenji to his feet, while running back to the classroom to give Professor Sunako a quick summary of what the young man had said. Once she had permission, the girl took the spiky-haired teenager to the infirmary.

While Kenji mentally berated himself for lying to Airi, unbeknownst to either of them, a strange trail began to emanate from the wound inflicted by the humanoid being.

1plsj92,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1plsj92,Adventure in Transylvania: A Marvel of Modern Lego Engineering,"Finally had the time to finish this set, and I know many of you were probably done long ago but I felt inclined to chime in on this set.  
So, I gotta preface this by stating first off that I don’t really write reviews for just about anything, because opinions are like assholes and likely nobody cares to see mine on the internet.  But now and then there are circumstances which amaze and baffle where recognition is due, and this is one of those I believe.

This is, in my 30 years of avid building, the most well-designed and carefully engineered set that Lego has ever put into production (albeit limited, as a Bricklink designer program set).  Seeing as how BLDP titleholder status has served before as a gateway to design team careers with the LEGO group in the past, it cannot be understated how moronic and frankly wasteful if the company did not do anything & everything in its ability to bring the designer, known as ‘Sleepless Nights’, onboard with the group in a permanent position befitting his skill & potential.

This is one of the most beautiful chunks of plastic to ever grace my coffee table, competing easily with the trevi but surpassing when considering this was all from the designer’s imagination, there was no existing reference material to simply duplicate and the fact it is a much more fun build.  It is, admittedly, smaller than one might expect for over 4,000 pieces but this is not a negative when considering other factors; it’s abundantly clear that the approach in thought was very much executed as a true stone brick gothic manor would be, and as a contractor I really appreciated the realistic approach of truly relying on solid, hefty shear walls & load bearing cross-beams to create something that is both beautiful but also far more rigid that one might expect from a set of similar aesthetic & detail.  Furthermore, the surprisingly conservative footprint becomes all the more impressive when one accounts for the absolutely brilliant concealment of the running mechanical features, and does nothing short of amaze the builder upon the realization of not only how well these mechanisms are hidden beneath the floors, but surpass the level of similar functions we see with LEGO in that it utilizes interactive timing between cogs as well, as if it were like a precisely set distributor & rotor in an engine.

The one setback is hard to call just that; and I almost feel bad for mentioning these as I doubt I could ever produce such a marvel if given a lifetime, myself.  With most other sets, this wouldn’t have even caught my notice but it is only because of how perfect in every regard this set is that it stands out.  The minifigure selection seems odd to me; in all fairness BLDP designs are fairly restricted in the parts they can use for these but with the overwhelming Dracula theme at play, the extensive lineup of a family with kids, chef, pirate/adventurer, etc etc does feel a bit random when deployed over maybe a more conservative selection perhaps more accurately depicting the Stoker source work or the genre of horror in general.  Perhaps I am missing something in this regard?  It’s not that it detracts from this masterpiece of ABS architecture so much as it feels a bit unnecessary or “extra”.  I did, however, as a personal touch, swap out the stock skeletal Dracula minifig for my own custom-made Count Orlock (pictured).

Sleepless Nights, all I can say is ‘mwah’ 🤌🏻 *chef’s kiss*

This is a bit of a long post but I guess I have the time, and well, I hope you do, too.


I find myself at a difficult cross-road, one thats tugs on my heart an immense, immense amount. 

Since 2021, I have been involved with this girl, D (26). We met in 2021 and grew extremely close eventually falling for eachother deeply. D comes from a well to do background where her parents are extremely well off and she herself is in school for medicine. She is a good person with a good heart. It is also important that even though we're Muslim, both of us are different sects where she's a majority and I'm a minority. There are some minor differences but nothing too life changing or altering. Just difference of opinions. 

In 2023, we tried getting together but after she got into med school, it was a hard no from her parents citing that I'm a different sect and that I had just graduated university. It is important to note that even though I'm 28 right now, my eventual plan is to go to 
law school within the next few years. I just can't go right now because I take care of my parents full time and am responsible for both of them a complete household. Back to the point where in December 2023, we decide to end things completely but she comes back in January 2024 citing that shes in love with me and wants to be with me. We date that entire year and its completely wonderful but her parents still reject us citing again that I'm a minority, I'm not in law school and settled, and that my family isn't that rich. 

This thing has continued into this year where we broke it off earlier this year but I've reached out to her thrice or four times where she tells me she thinks about me a lot and loves me and everything else in between but that she has zero support from her family and none of them will support her through this.  I told her anything is possible if we really tried but all I need is patience from her as I work towards getting towards my goals. I'm just extremely ties to my responsibilities but that I will 100% get there.

My question is - what if I let her go? Its her first relationship so she hasn't been through this with anyone where as I have been so I have context and I feel like the love her and I share is so deep and pure and we truly have our souls connected. I'm just bound by my life. I'm late by a lot of peoples standards, I know that. But I'm actively trying to fix it. None of the problems I face were my own fault rather was a combination of me getting sick, my parents getting sick, and me being responsible for quite literally everything. Would letting her go be okay? Should I keep on fighting for this? I feel so dejected and sad. Her parents suggested to her to meet a guy through an arranged marraige scenario and while she initially resisted, she is going to meet him for coffee. She still loves me. I'm just so confused and have no idea how to guide myself out of these feelings.

I still go into the same coffee shop and recently found out from a couple of her ex-colleagues that she did like me too. I wasn’t just imagining it. I also found out that she has recently started work at a different coffee shop about 10 miles away from where I live. Not a shop I’ve ever visited before but not too far away. Would it be possible for me to visit her in the coffee shop she now works at and ask her out without coming across as weird or desperate? If so, what would the best way do it? I should say that she’s shy and introverted and the last thing I want to do is make her feel uncomfortable. I know I also have to bear in mind she will be working and may be busy.

Like I mentioned, we are staying at a hotel in San Jose but have day trips planned to other parts of the country through a reputable agency that picks up/ drops off at your hotel. We also wanted to do local things in the city but were wondering about Uber’s and if it’s easy to access them. 

The biggest thing is my family wants to go to the Hacienda Alsacia Starbucks Coffee Farm in Dulce Nombre. So if it is easy to access them in San Jose would it be easy to get one from there ? It’s approximately 30 minutes from our hotel. 

I would greatly appreciate any help and any tips for our first time traveling to the country and if there are any things we should check out. Thank you everyone! ",2,1765650578.0,CostaRicaTravel,2,1.0,False

Something so ingrained in me is to not offend others in shallow social interactions. And in most everyday life, this is a good personality trait (albeit tiring at times), but I often feel like I’m being taken advantage of by these “tipping” screens. 

However, recently I’ve switched to mostly using cash for any non-sit-down-restaurant situations, and it helps me in a few ways:

1. I can more easily control “how much” to tip. If I’m getting a coffee, I usually just forgo the coins. This lets me maintain some semblance of tipping, but without adding 3 dollars to a 5 dollar coffee. 

2. It helps me get over the mental hurdle of explicitly pressing a button to “not tip” someone.

Plus, there’s basically no work options for the kind of career I want (English degree, so looking into publication/editing, communications, admin stuff, office work, anything along those lines).

I’m doing research and I thought Lakewood seemed nice as it’s not too bustling, but it has city amenities and is close to nature. I like lakes, libraries, coffee shops, malls, bookstores, and restaurants. I don’t drink or go to bars or clubs or anything like that. Would it be a good option for me?

I came across this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/biglaw/comments/1otu6uq/networking_with_students_what_qs_do_you_actually/) on another sub called **""Networking with Students: What Qs Do You Actually Like / Hate Hearing?""**

I actually thought was super helpful and I wanted to pull together what I thought were some of my favorite comments from that thread and share that with you guys here in case it helps as you continue networking and applying as we're in the heat of recruiting now and through the next few months!

# So let's get into it!

If you’ve ever signed up for a coffee chat, alumni call, firm reception, or student-to-student networking event and thought *“Okay… now what do I actually ask?”* — this post is for you.

A lot of networking advice is either:

* way too generic (“Ask about culture!”), or
* unrealistically strategic (“Subtly extract hiring signals while building rapport!”).

In reality, many law students aren’t trying to “work the room.” They’re just trying **not to sound awkward**, not to waste the other person’s time, and ideally to walk away with real insight about the firm or practice, and ideally with a bit more of a relationship with someone that might end up becoming a solid network (maybe even a mentor?) down the line.

So this list here is less of a “perfect questions” list and more as a **framework for having a normal, productive conversation** with questions that attorney's appreciate hearing. 

# 1) Networking isn’t grilling — it’s conversation

The goal isn’t to impress someone with how much research you’ve done or to fire off a checklist of questions. The goal is to get them talking about **their experience** — and to listen.

People generally enjoy networking when:

* they feel heard,
* the conversation flows naturally, and
* the questions feel genuinely curious rather than transactional.

If you approach networking as a conversation instead of an interview, you’re already ahead.

# 2) Starter questions — safe, engaging, informative

These can be good when you’re just getting to know someone’s background/meeting them cold at an event:

**Career & Experience**

* “How did you end up in your practice group?”
* “What first drew you to this firm?”
* “What’s one thing you genuinely enjoy about your work?”

**Firm & Culture**

* “How would you describe the culture here?”
* “What surprised you most after joining?”

These questions do two things at once: they’re easy to answer *and* they usually lead to useful follow-ups.

# 3) Smart, specific questions — show depth (without being intense)

Once rapport is built, you can go a level deeper:

**Practice & Work**

* “What kinds of matters do you find yourself working on most?”
* “How early do juniors or summers start signaling practice interests?”
* “What skills seem to matter most in your group?”

**Career Development**

* “How has your role changed since you started?”
* “What’s something you wish you knew earlier in law school?”
* “How does mentorship work in practice here?” 

# 4) What not to ask (especially early on)

Some topics are better saved for later stages of recruiting:

* Compensation, bonuses, billable targets
* “How bad are the hours?” framed bluntly
* Anything that sounds like you’re ranking firms mid-conversation

If you care about lifestyle or fit (which everyone does), ask indirectly:

* “What does a busy week look like for you?”
* “How do people manage competing priorities?”

Same information, better delivery.

# 5) Let the conversation flow

A simple mental structure:

1. Background — how they got there
2. Experience — what the work is like
3. Reflection — what they enjoy or find challenging
4. Advice — what they’d do differently

Follow up on what they say. If they mention a deal, case, or transition — ask about *that*. That’s where real conversations happen.

# 6) Ending the conversation well

Before you wrap up:

* Thank them genuinely
* Ask if there’s anyone else they recommend speaking with
* Follow up with a short thank-you email referencing something specific if you can

You don’t need to ask for anything. A strong conversation stands on its own.

# 7) A few plug-and-play questions

* “What’s something someone might not expect about this firm?”
* “How has your perspective on BigLaw changed since you started?”
* “What advice would you give someone heading into OCI?”

# Final takeaway

Good networking:

* isn’t about perfect questions,
* doesn’t require insider knowledge, and
* works best when it feels human.

Be curious, listen closely, and treat the conversation like what it is — one person sharing their experience with another. Everything else follows from that.

If you need a more in depth networking guide after this, feel free to DM. I'm happy to share the one I made.

**Why This Pick?**



If this game were taking place in San Antonio, I might feel differently…but the Thunder are just too good at home, friends. In addition, while their defense is elite, they’ve put at least 131 points on the board in their last 3 straight games, and haven’t put less than 120 on the board in their last 6 straight. On the other side, the Spurs have put at least 130 in the bag in each of their last 2 matchups – and that was without Victor Wembanyama on the court. This game should fall North of 232.0 – I’m on the Over to cash.

Quick heads up, this is a promo post, but I’m genuinely looking for advice and ideas.

We’ve been running a pottery studio in Mulund called Studio Vida for the last 4 years. Ever since we started, we’ve wanted to add a small coffee space alongside it. After a year of planning and renovating, we’re finally opening it tomorrow (Sunday, 14th Dec).

The coffee spot is called AND Coffee (short for Another Necessary Delay). The idea is simple: slow down a bit. Have a coffee, read, draw, paint, write, or just sit. It’s not a coworking space and definitely not a laptop-heavy café. More of a co-chilling space.

A couple of things to know:
-It’s on the 7th floor (proper hidden gem 😅)
-It’s a small space, very intimate

We’d honestly love to hear from people in Mulund:
What would make this a place you’d want to hang out at?
Events, timings, music, rules, vibes, anything.

Also, we have no background in running a food or coffee business, so all ideas and feedback are more than welcome.

If you’re curious, we’re opening tomorrow. Drop by for a coffee or just to say hi.",7,1765649847.0,Mulund,10,0.89,False
