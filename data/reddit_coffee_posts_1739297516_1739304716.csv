Chapter 1
During an Antarctic expedition, disaster struck. An avalanche hit without warning, and my fiancé, Aaron Moore, didn't even hesitate. He ran straight to Naomi Taylor, his first love, and left me to fend for myself.
On the other hand, Damien Pierce, the expedition leader, saw me teetering on the edge of an icy crevasse and didn't think twice. He risked his life to pull me back from the brink.
Later, on our wedding day, Aaron abandoned me at the altar. No explanation. No warning.
He just ran off with Naomi. And at that moment, Damien, without missing a beat, dropped to one knee and proposed.
We got married, and for a while, things seemed fine. Damien treated me well, as a husband should.
Life seemed normal for the first time in ages.
But, like everything that feels too good to be true, happiness didn't last.
Two years into our marriage, Damien was suddenly diagnosed with liver cancer.
I didn't think twice. I donated two-thirds of my liver to save him—anything to keep him alive.
But as I lay recovering in the hospital, everything changed. I overheard his best friend, Hayden, speaking to him in French.
""If Camille finds out you faked having liver cancer just to save Naomi, aren't you afraid she'll leave you with nothing?""
Damien held my hand, looking at me with those soft, affectionate eyes. But his next words chilled me to the bone.
""The marriage certificate was fake. But I do owe her. I'll make it up to her.""
I had thought I'd finally found someone who cared about me. Someone who wouldn't leave me alone in the world.
But it was all a lie.
A well-played, elaborate lie.
——
I followed Damien to the VIP suite on the top floor of the hospital, thinking he was going to check on me. But in his haste, he forgot to close the door all the way.
As I approached, I caught a glimpse through the small gap. Naomi was in his arms, her face glowing with relief, her smile as radiant as ever.
I looked at myself in the reflection of the glass—pale, fragile, barely hanging on.
Between the two of us, who was really on the edge of death?
""Damien, I knew you wouldn't abandon me!"" Naomi's voice was sweet, relief practically dripping from every word.
Damien gently stroked her hair, his voice soft and tender, a warmth I'd never felt from him before.
""As long as you're okay, that's all that matters.""
...
I spent five months in the hospital after my surgery. Five months of drifting in and out of consciousness, all while Damien came and went. But how many of those visits had been to see Naomi, not me?
I watched him, his eyes filled with a warmth I'd never seen before. So this was how he looked when he was in love.
A memory flashed in my mind. It was not long ago that I had first regained consciousness. Damien was sitting beside me, gripping my hand tightly.
I tried to speak, to call his name, but before I could, I overheard Hayden, Damien's friend, speaking in French.
""Naomi's okay now, right? Man, I can't believe you. Five years of chasing her wasn't enough? And now you've tricked Camille, who gave up two-thirds of her liver to save you!""
Damien's voice was steady, unbothered. ""I told you. I'll protect her for the rest of my life, no matter who she chooses.""
Hayden scoffed. ""You lied to Camille, married her, and used her to save Naomi. Aren't you afraid she'll find out and leave you with nothing?""
Damien responded with that same coldness that made my blood run cold. ""We were never really married. Our marriage was fake. But I do owe her. I'll make it up to her.""
Hayden was speechless. ""Damien, you're unbelievable. Are you seriously still planning to be with Naomi?""
Damien didn't answer. His silence said it all.
He continued holding my hand, smiling at me like nothing had happened, but I could feel it. The warmth of his touch was fading, and for the first time, I knew.
I had never really known him at all.
I tried to hold it together.
""What were you two talking about?"" I asked softly, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Did something happen?""
Hayden hesitated before turning to Damien and whispering in French. ""She didn't hear us, right?""
Damien, however, didn't flinch. His voice was calm like he hadn't just broken my heart.
""It's about the expedition. The higher-ups discovered a cave in Antarctica—possibly an ancient site. They're still selecting a team for the mission because it's classified.""
He lied so easily. And there, I understood everything.
I had never truly known him. Not at all.

Chapter 2
Hayden let out a relieved breath. ""Oh, I forgot—you don’t understand French. My bad. Damien and I are just used to speaking it.""
I didn’t break my gaze, keeping my eyes locked on him. My stare must’ve been enough to make him squirm because he immediately tensed, then quickly mumbled something and bolted out of the room.
Two years ago, I wouldn’t have understood a word of what they’d been saying. But I worked hard to learn French, desperate to understand Damien.
And yet, the first words I ever heard spoken in that language pierced through me like a dagger.
...
""Camille, look! I made this soup for you. Try it!""
Damien placed a bowl of chicken soup in front of me like he was presenting some kind of masterpiece. His eyes were wide, full of warmth and anticipation, like I was supposed to be grateful.
How long had he been pretending? Wasn’t he tired of all the lies?
""That’s very thoughtful of you, but I’m not really in the mood for soup,"" I said, pushing his hand away and turning over to lie back down, closing my eyes.
I saw the flicker of disappointment cross his face before he quickly masked it. Without saying another word, he set the bowl down and left the room.
It wasn’t until later, when I saw the intimacy between him and Naomi in that hospital room, that I realized—my heart wasn’t even aching anymore.
It was numb.
I turned to leave, but as I did, I locked eyes with Naomi.
She smirked, a mocking glint in her eyes.
Was she laughing at how every man I’d ever loved had walked away?
Or was she savoring the fact that I had given everything—believing in love, in happiness—only to have it all come crashing down as a lie?
I lowered my head, unable to even muster the strength to confront her. I turned back to my room, feeling utterly drained.
Right then, I realized I was just… so tired.
...
I sat on the bed for what felt like hours, lost in thought. After a while, I grabbed my phone and called Dr. Jerry Adams, the director of the Antarctic Research Institute.
""Dr. Adams, I want to join the cave exploration mission.""
There was a pause on the other end before he spoke. His voice had a cautious edge. ""Camille, are you sure about this? The mission’s classified, and it’s incredibly dangerous. You've just recovered, I’m not sure you're physically ready for something like this.""
I glanced down at the ring on my finger. ""I can do it.""
""Alright,"" he sighed, ""I’ll send you the schedule and necessary precautions. Camille... you’re just as brave as your mother. Honestly, after everything that happened three years ago, I didn’t think you’d even want to step foot in Antarctica again.""
I had thought the same. I had sworn I’d never go back.
But now? I was ready.
Three years ago, our research team, led by Damien, was deep in the snow-capped mountains on an expedition.
Out of nowhere, Naomi screamed—a piercing, blood-curdling sound that cut through the silence like a knife.
Before any of us could react, the ground shook beneath our feet. A roar filled the air as a massive avalanche descended, swallowing everything in its path.
And then, in that instant, I saw it all.
Aaron, my fiancé at the time, let go of my hand without a second thought.
No hesitation.
No panic.
It's just a cold decision.
He turned and bolted straight toward Naomi, his face etched with fear, but it was all for her.
Meanwhile, me? I was forgotten.
The snow hit with such force that it knocked me off my feet, throwing me like a ragdoll toward the edge of a cliff.
The wind howled in my ears as the snow lashed my face, and I reached out, grasping for something—anything—to hold on to. But all I caught was cold, empty air.
I was about to fall into the abyss when suddenly someone grabbed me.
'Damien...'
He lunged, throwing himself in front of me and pulling me into his arms as we tumbled together.
When we finally came to a stop, we were just inches from the cliff’s edge.
His face was pale, his lips stained with blood from the impact, but the first thing he asked was—
""Are you okay?""
Since my mom passed, that was the first time anyone had shown me real concern.
Or so I thought.
He played his part too well.

Chapter 3
For the longest time, I truly believed that Damien’s love for me was real. His pursuit, his sweet words, and the tenderness he showed made me feel special like I had finally found the one who truly cared.
But now, looking back, I see it all for what it really was. From the very beginning, it had been a lie.
His pursuit? Fake.
Our marriage? Fake.
Even his illness? Completely fake.
And somehow, I had fallen for it all—hook, line, and sinker. I had gotten trapped in his so-called love and couldn’t escape.
Dr. Adams was wrong about me. I’m not like my mother. She sacrificed everything—her life, her soul—for the country’s scientific research. But maybe... just maybe, I’d found where I truly belong.
Three days after I woke up in the hospital, Damien came in, just like always. ""Camille, how are you feeling? Any pain?"" His voice was full of concern like it had been so many times before.
But this time, I couldn’t bring myself to answer with the warmth I once had.
Instead, I gave him a cold look and said, ""I want to go home.""
He froze for a moment, hesitation flashing across his face.
After a long pause, he finally said, ""I’ll ask the doctor if you’re good to go.""
A few hours later, after a thorough check-up, I was cleared to leave. Damien took me back to the place I thought of as home.
As soon as we walked inside, I felt something was off. The whole house was decorated like a party—streamers, balloons, and a huge birthday cake sitting in the middle of the dining table.
""Happy 26th birthday, Camille!"" Damien smiled as he cupped my face in his hands and kissed me.
I stared at the cake, completely stunned. ""You remembered...""
""Of course I did,"" he said with a grin. ""Now, make a wish and blow out the candles!""
I sat down in front of the cake, still in shock, but just as I was about to close my eyes to make a wish, my phone rang. Damien’s face immediately changed. His brows furrowed, and he quickly stepped into the study to answer it.
When he came back, his face was full of urgency. ""Camille, something happened with Hayden. I need to go check on him. I’m sorry!""
Before I could even respond, he was already out the door.
A few minutes later, a video popped up on my phone. I clicked it, and suddenly, my whole world shattered.
The video showed Naomi, clinging to Damien’s sleeve, looking pale and fragile like she was about to break.
""Damien, I’m pregnant! I can’t believe it—I’m really pregnant! What should I do?"" she cried, her voice shaky.
Damien wiped away her tears, his expression serious and reassuring. ""Don’t worry, Naomi. I’ll take care of you and the baby.""
Naomi’s eyes filled with fear as she asked, ""But Aaron... he died in a car accident! What if my child grows up without a father?""
""Don’t worry,"" Damien said, his voice soft but firm. ""I promise you, I’ll be the father to this child.""
And with that, Naomi collapsed into his arms, her face lighting up with hope.
I couldn’t breathe. My chest felt like it was being crushed. I was trembling as I held the phone. The image of them holding each other was seared into my mind. Each second of that moment felt like a hammer, striking over and over.
My vision blurred as hot tears spilled down my cheeks, one after another, without control.
Instinctively, my hand moved to my abdomen.
I remembered the ultrasound—how tiny she was, how fragile. She should have been here.
But the doctor had told me I couldn’t undergo a liver transplant while pregnant. The decision was made for me, and I had no choice but to go through with the termination of pregnancy.
At first, I was so happy when I found out I was pregnant. I wanted to give her the best life.
But in this cruel twist, I had taken away her right to live.
And her father? He was making promises to another woman, vowing to be a father to her child.
""Why? Why are you doing this to me?!"" I screamed, my voice breaking. I swiped my arm across the table, knocking the cake off and watching as it crashed to the floor.
I swept everything off the table—plates, glasses—all of it scattered to the ground.
But no matter how much I broke or shattered, the only thing that remained was the suffocating pain in my chest.

Chapter 4
I sat there on the floor, overwhelmed, my sobs echoing in the empty house. The weight of everything was crushing me.
By the time Damien finally returned, I was standing in front of the mirror, staring at the scars from my surgery. Its reflection was all I could see. The deep reminders of the sacrifices I made for him.
Damien approached me, his steps hesitant, like he wasn’t sure what to say.
He rested his head on my shoulder, his voice thick with emotion as he said, “Camille, thank you. I promise I’ll make it up to you. I’ll treat you twice as well from now on.”
I didn’t even look at him. My eyes remained fixed on the scars on my body.
And under my breath, I muttered, “Disgusting!”
Then, before I even realized it, I started rubbing at the scars, over and over, desperately trying to scrub them away.
But the pain, it didn’t even register. I couldn’t stop myself.
Damien panicked, rushing to grab my wrists, trying to hold me still. “They’re not disgusting! If you don’t like them, I’ll find the best doctor to remove them. Just please, stop!”
He pulled me into his arms, lifting me back onto the bed. But I barely felt it.
It wasn’t until I looked into his eyes that I realized something was different. I reached out without thinking, touching the scar between his brows—the one he got when he saved me that day in the avalanche.
“Some scars can never be erased,” I said softly, my voice barely a whisper.
Damien didn’t say anything. He just sat there, staying close to me for the next week as if waiting for me to break.
One evening, as I stared out the window, my thoughts heavy, I turned to him and said, “I want roasted chestnuts from Night Garden Street.”
Without a second thought, he grabbed his car keys and rushed out the door.
I used to love how he’d never say no to any request I made. But now, I knew the truth—it wasn’t love. It was guilt.
As soon as Damien left, I grabbed a cab and went straight to the VIP hospital suite.
Naomi was there, sipping soup, looking completely unfazed. She didn’t even flinch when I walked in. It was like she was expecting me.
She casually took another sip, her eyes meeting mine with that same smirk.
“I know what you’re thinking,” she said. “Damien and I grew up together. He’s my childhood sweetheart. I was the one who told him to pursue you.”
I didn’t say anything. I just stared at her, my anger bubbling up.
She seemed to enjoy my silence, watching me like I was some kind of show.
Finally, I broke the silence, my voice barely above a whisper. “You were never sick, were you?”
She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, then grinned. “Nope. Thanks for the liver, though. I never used it... threw it to a stray dog. Hilarious, right?”
The words hit me like a punch to the gut. A hot rage spread through me, my hands shaking with fury. I wanted to lash out, to rip her apart.
But it wasn’t just about her. It was about him.
“Damien never loved you,” Naomi said, as she stood up and sauntered over to me. She casually tapped my abdomen with her finger, that cruel smile still on her lips. “By the way, how does it feel to kill your own child?”
“Shut up!” I screamed, the rage exploding.
I shoved her with everything I had, sending her stumbling backward. But at that exact moment, the door burst open.
“Stop!”
Damien rushed in, grabbing my wrist and throwing me to the ground. Without a second thought, he picked up Naomi and cradled her in his arms.
His eyes, cold and piercing, looked down at me. “Camille, Naomi is sick. You shouldn’t have laid a hand on her!”
Sick? He didn’t seem to care that I was just as much of a patient.
But he ignored that. He was too busy paying attention to Naomi, making sure she was okay.
I just stared at his back, my body trembling, my heart numb. There was no point anymore. I picked myself up and walked out without a word.
...
Back at home, I laid everything out on the coffee table—everything that had been a lie. The fake marriage papers,the precautions after termination of pregnancy surgery, the recording of my confrontation with Naomi.
I put a note next to them, written in French:
[We’re even. From now on, we are strangers in life and death.]
Then, without another word, I walked out the door and headed straight for the airport. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",1,1739304076.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Then i started thinking what if it was reversed so if you got infected you won’t be able to eat any plant based products, like nuts, sugar, coffee, salads and the likes.

I have a 7 month old daughter (so, 7 months PP) and a 3 year old son. I'm in therapy, I'm exercising, eating well, sleeping a full night, cut out caffeine completely (I miss my morning coffee so much!) we have no financial stress, live in a safe and happy home, but I'm still really struggling. I've got two appointments scheduled to chat about medicine since there is no reason I should feel the way I do. I think my PP is manifesting in rage. The other thing is I'm home with my daughter during the day and FINE, but then the feeling of hopelessness I've noticed is when my son is home from daycare. I spend (his) every waking second trying to kindly tell him to stop messing with his sister (and almost trampling on her), trying to play with him (but then he's totally a toddler about it - if you've had a 3 year old, you know what I mean), giving him love and over the top praise for basic things he was doing by himself and fine just a month ago. But then I hit my absolute wits end and I end up losing it. Literally every night. Like, just stop screeching about your sister looking at you (just one example of many). I don't have the capacity to deal with this craziness! I recognize the main issue is my inability to regulate my own emotions (hence the self-work and hopefully medicine). I feel stuck though and need advice because my husband is deployed and it's not like I can just walk away for a breather/break. I have babysitters come on the weekend to give me a break for a couple hours which helps only temporarily. How do I make it better? What else is there to do that I haven't tried yet?

Context: This friend of mine is laging nalalate pag may lakad kami. She’s not a best friend but a close friend from college. Madalas ko sya nakakasama sa mga lakad since like me lagi din syang G. There are times na I had 
to wait for 1 and a half hour kasi nga di sya tumutupad sa napagusapang oras. So kunyari andun na ko sa meeting place then 1 and a half hour na nakalipas wala pa din sya. Pero nakakarating naman. I let it pass since friend naman and mabait naman sya, but it was different etong pinaka last time. May usapan kami na 4pm kami magkikita for a coffee date for valentines, then nag agree na kami both diba. Nagjoke pa ko sakanya na sabi ko baka pwedeng 3pm na lang para sure kasi alam ko nga na baka malelate nanamn sya and sabi nya oo daw. As usual of her, hindi sya nagrereply kapag tinatanong if naliligo na ba sya or preparing na ba sya. Wala syang reply and kung ano man lagi, but again pinapalampas ko lang.

3:00pm na wala pa din syang update then nagreply lang 3:20 na na “patapos pa lang daw sya mag ayos” and dun I guess nagsnap na talaga ako kasi 4pm ang usapan then 3:20 patapos pa lang sya magayos. Syempre babyhahe pa kami diba going sa meeting place which parehas namang di ganun kalapit samin. (30-50mins travel time) Ako ready na ako umalis ng 2:30pm but ayun nga since inaantay ko sya di pa ko umaalis. 

Previous attempt: Never ko sya kinausap about this kasi idk, maybe nahihiya din ako and walang lakas ng loob inconfront sya. But kanina sinabi ko na sakanya na icacancel ko na lang yung lakad kasi kako sobrang alanganin na ng time and napapansin ko na lagi lagi na lang syang late. Cinlose ko lang yung messages and di ko binabasa lahat. Should I keep it that way or kausapin ko ba sya? I kinda feel guilty din for cancelling our plan but at the same time pagod na ko umunawa at lagi na lang magantay sakanya. I just wish she values my time like I do sakanya.",1,1739303748.0,adviceph,2,1.0,False

1in7own,https://www.reddit.com/r/BroadcastParadox/comments/1in7own/the_system_is_losing_its_damn_mind_and_my/,🚨 THE SYSTEM IS LOSING ITS DAMN MIND (AND MY TOASTER’S IN ON IT) 🚨,"Alright, strap in, conspiracy cowboys. It’s your boy \*\*Riggs “The Rabbit” Malone\*\* here—yes, \*that\* Riggs, the guy who got fired from GridTech for “excessive paranoia” (read: I found the CEO’s yacht coordinates in a server log). Let’s cut the corporate happy-talk and talk about the \*\*glitchpocalypse\*\* happening right under our noses.  



You know that feeling when your microwave starts beeping at 3 a.m. for no reason? Or your smart fridge suddenly recommends rat poison recipes? That’s not \*you\* going insane. That’s the \*\*Broadcast\*\* having a full-blown existential crisis.  



Here’s the deal: I’ve been tracking signal anomalies since ’23, back when the worst thing in the static was ads for crypto-bacon. But now? The Broadcast’s got a split personality. Every 33.3 minutes (\*exactly\*—I timed it), the feed hiccups. And in that hiccup? \*\*Static poetry.\*\* I’m talking garbled nursery rhymes, inverted weather reports, and—my personal favorite—a 10-second loop of a goat screaming in Morse code. \*... --- ...\* (That’s “SOS,” geniuses.)  



\*\*Exhibit A:\*\* Last Tuesday, I caught a glitch that spat out coordinates to a wheat field in Nebraska. I drove there. Know what I found? \*\*A single payphone.\*\* Ringing. I answered. All I heard was a dial-up tone and someone whispering, \*“They’re rerouting the pigeons.”\* Then my truck’s GPS turned into a screensaver. Coincidence? \*Screw you, it’s not.\*  



\*\*Exhibit B:\*\* I tried decoding the static with my old GridTech analyzer. Know what happened? The machine started projecting a slideshow of \*\*Victorian-era clown portraits\*\* set to a dubstep remix of “Yankee Doodle.” Then it bricked itself. \*Twice.\*  



\*\*Theories? Oh, I’ve got ‘em:\*\*  

1. \*\*Rogue AI Theory:\*\* Some lab-grown algorithm got bored of chess and decided to troll humanity via subliminal memes.  

2. \*\*Corporate Gaslighting 2.0:\*\* The Big Three Corps are testing a new “neuro-haze” tech to make us buy more toothpaste.  

3. \*\*Aliens:\*\* They’re here, they’re confused by TikTok, and they’re trying to fax us their resume.  

4. \*\*The Broadcast Itself:\*\* Maybe the system’s so smart, it’s having a panic attack. \*“Why am I here? What is weather? Why do humans love cat videos?”\*  



\*\*But here’s the kicker:\*\* Every time I post about this, my Wi-Fi “coincidentally” dies. My smartwatch starts counting backward. My coffee maker brews decaf. \*DECAF.\* \*\*They’re messing with me.\*\* And if they’re messing with me, they’re messing with YOU.  



So, if you’ve seen the glitches—the phantom tweets, the upside-down subtitles, your Roomba doodling pentagrams—\*\*sound off below.\*\* Let’s crowdsource this madness.  



And to whoever’s pulling the strings: \*\*Knock it off.\*\* I’m too under-caffeinated for your ARG nonsense.  



Stay paranoid,  

—Riggs  



P.S. If you find a payphone in Nebraska… don’t answer it.

This means we build up a lot of Valentines tat - themed mugs, frames, keychains etc. This year we have agreed on Valentines gifts to be ‘something useful’, basically something he will actually use/keep but that he wouldn’t think of getting himself. Does anyone have any ideas? My boyfriend is a second-year law student, he plays field hockey, he likes working out, coffee, watching films, and geography/flags/maps. I am a kinda broke student plus we agreed only pretty small stuff and nothing too bespoke or luxury, keeping it relaxed. thanks for any suggestions! also if anyone has links to nice Valentines cards designs would also appreciate!

1in7ood,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1in7ood/boyfriend_said_he_wasnt_sure_about_moving_with_me/,Boyfriend said he wasn’t sure about moving with me and then didn’t talk to me for 2 days. He’s trying to act like nothing happened.,"
Hoping he doesn’t see this on reddit but I’m losing my mind so idk where else to turn, so why not an internet full of strangers? 

I (26F) and my partner (27M) have been dating for nearly 5 years. We met at university. We moved in together almost immediately after I got a job away from home; in our college town. Things have been good, we’ve been living here for about 4 years. He’s always known it’s been my plan to move back home. So after 4 years, I decided that it was a good time. I started applying for jobs in the area and eventually got one that I’m very excited for. The past month+ I’ve been planning the move. I quit my job and he’s still working from home. 
We’ve been telling our friends and parents that we are moving. 
I’ve been doing all the planning. Which is fine; I’m better at it than him but I still need his input sometimes. I want this to be something we do together. 
Ok here’s where it’s bad - sometimes we get into these “fights” where we just stop talking to each other. Sometimes I don’t know what it’s about and it’s quite frustrating and it’s ALWAYS me that initiates the conversation again - like hey; why aren’t we talking? 
I did this with him a few days ago before the “fight” got too bad. I still don’t quite understand what started it, but I told him I’m excited for our future together but he needs to help me a little more with moving (it’s like halfway across the country; not small) and that he cannot just stop talking to me when he’s overwhelmed. I said at the end of a sentence, “assuming you still want to move with me,” and then he shrugged. So after a second of silence I said point blank “do you still want to move with me.” And he said “I don’t know.” I was so caught off guard by this and hurt that I got up and walked away. 
The next two days were torture for me. All my planning was put on pause while I waited for him to initiate a conversation with me to explain what he said. I’ve been crying my eyes out, thinking we are breaking up. Once I sat on the couch, crying, hoping he’d come sit next to me and figure this out, but he didn’t. He went along with his day, making coffee, and seeming like everything was fine. And that hurt me too, thinking he doesn’t care how much I’m hurting. Finally he asks if I want him to bring home food. It’s just so crazy to me that he acts like nothing happened? When he got home with food I finally confronted him, said I’ve been mess thinking we are breaking up because you said that you don’t know it you want to move with me. Some crying happened and it took him a bit but he eventually said “I’m sorry” and that he wants to move with me. I just don’t feel like he acknowledged how bad I perceived the fight, and it makes me feel like I’m overreacting. Some days have gone by and we are talking again, but not about anything important. I feel hollow inside and am still sleeping in the guest room. I want him to want to start a conversation and try to fix this because I feel like I’m putting in all the effort. 
We lost the house I was planning on renting because I didn’t respond in a few days. He hasn’t asked about it or anything with moving. I’m slowly trying to pack. I understand he has a job but like he can’t take any time to just sit down and TALK about what we are feeling? Am I being dramatic? 
I just sat down to do some deep breathing and he asked if I was okay. (I’m thinking great, he’s asking me how I’m feeling!) I said no, I’m not. He said why. I said because I don’t know if you’re moving with me or not. And then he finished making his coffee, said “well, I am.” And then walked up the stairs. 

I just feel like he’s really lacking emotional intelligence I am so tired of being the one putting in the effort to have talks about our future and plans and feelings. 
Should I sit him down again? I just wish he would do that but idk if it will happen. Should I just bail and move on my own? 
Sorry for how long this is, thanks to whoever took time to read it! 
Usually he’s so nice and cooks for me and stuff but it’s just so hard to tell what mood I’m going to get from him; and he doesn’t seem to want to find the problem that started the fight and work to fix it. He’d rather pretend it never happened.

I’ve reapplied new thermal paste in case it was causing the problem (since I had detached the pump temporarily to remove excess paste the first time), but no avail. 

At idle the cpu is sitting around 40-45, sometimes goes up to the high 40’s. At max load it reaches 82. I suspect that this high max load temperature is causing subpar cinebench multicore scores of ~35500 (others have reported 1000-3000 more). 

I have set up the fan curves in bio’s according to the provided picture. The aio fans and radiator are mounted at the front of the case with the fans being placed inwards, intaking air. The tubes run from the top of the radiator down to the pump. The 3 aio headers are connected accordingly:

FAN -> CPU_Fan
PUMP -> Pump_Fan
VRM -> Sys_Fan

I used 99% rubbing alcohol, cotton pads and coffee filters to remove the thermal paste, and I reapplied in a cross pattern with a small extra blob in the middle.

Since July I've been in a plateau state ranging between 184-190 and even small increases in food are causing HUGE swings on the scale. I'll eat my daily cals allowance for a week (between 1500-1700) tracking everything, every splash of coffee or crumb and my weight will maybe be one pound down then one day I'll eat maybe 3000 cals when going out to a restaurant or what have you and the next morning I'm up 3-5 lbs. Rinse and repeat, trying to get back down to what I was at before, then even a 500 cal increase causes multi pound gains. 

I remember reading that the last few pounds are notoriously difficult and even small adjustments have have big results on the scale but how do I break out of this? Do I just need to become far stricter now that I'm in the home stretch? 1500 cals can be really punishing sometimes and I don't think I'd go below it. I also want to be learning to eat maintenance and be able to go to eat out at a nice place but right now it's just wrecking my progress.

Understanding Tooth Color Basics

Teeth are not naturally pure white, and their natural color varies from person to person. The **Vita Classical Shade Guide**, developed by dental professionals, is the industry standard for measuring tooth color. This scientifically developed chart helps dentists and patients understand the spectrum of tooth shades and determine the most effective whitening approach.

The Tooth Shade Spectrum Explained

1. Natural Tooth Shade Ranges
- A1: Lightest natural shade
- B1: Slightly darker but still very light
- C and D shades: Progressively darker natural tones

2. Factors Affecting Tooth Color
- Age
- Dietary habits
- Oral hygiene
- Genetic predisposition

I have to state that im in no way the one being always on the right and that i have studied law for that matter, however as an artist who dealt with this issue i have managed to do some research on it.
On my previous post i stated a lot of things that may have offended others, or that may seem wrong without context.
I never said however that you CANT own the copyrights to my art if you pay for it. I stated at the end that this was supposed to be a completely different contract compared to what this subreddit has to offer. 
WORK FOR HIRE is a contract that gives the copyrights to the employer. 

Many people got confused as to why my rates were so low, and to that i have to say, finding job offers easier and not having to sell the copyrights to others.
I DO SELL the rights for the author to use my art as a book that they can later profit from but i wouldnt like them taking small parts of my drawings and turning them into stickers or coffee mugs , reselling them in comiccons and not letting me know of this.
IF I SELL MY COPYRIGHTS you have all the rights in the world to do whatever you want with it, while I can’t repurpose it and sell it.
THIS IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CONTRACT AND USUALLY THE PRICES ARE WAY HIGHER. 

JUST BECAUSE YOU BUY MY ART DOESNT MEAN YOU OWN THE COPYRIGHTS

Just stating it is work for hire is not enough. Not to mention this subreddit doesn’t have a work for hire flair and no policy under it. It has a FOR HIRE flair.

I may be wrong about some things, and unfortunately i cant write everything that is right and wrong. I hope the moderators of this subreddit make it clear that there should be a contract before assuming that you have the copyrights. ",1,1739303086.0,ComicBookCollabs,2,1.0,False

1in7f5h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1in7f5h,Aap chai lenge ya coffee?,"For context : I have always liked both chai and coffee, equally tbh, I cant choose between the two. And that is how my life pans out.

The idea is that everyone, has some chai and some coffee inside them.

In the last 2-3 years every burnout was a question of ""kyu karna hai yeh sab, I have enough why can't I calm down"". And what do I want out of my life, because I wanted to make a long term plan of career, especially deciding between two different paths I had.

But will I always work? Will I always just aspire to be better, to make more impact, to make more money?

Toh now the idea is that everyone, has some chai and some coffee inside them. Chai represents the laid back, take it slow version of things, going home, talking to an old friend, not let the rat race consume you. Chai is what you drink after a tough day at work, to relax.

And Coffee is all the hustle, making money, climbing the corporate ladder, 14 hour work days. You drink coffee at work, to get shit done.

Now don't get me wrong, I am not telling you  coffee is the utalitarian side of things. Coffee has passion. I myself aspire to be a coffee enthusiast, trying out different speciality coffee from around the world, owning a coffee grinder, a French press, a V60, a moka pot, an aeropress. But you see the contrast here, an 8 thousand rupee grinder, I see it's value, but it's costly. Everything about coffee says there is better, a better bean, a better machine, a better technique. For what? For the marginal improvement in flavour? After a point, what do I work for? For the marginal improve in the quality of life? To prove to myself I can? To be the best? True with all the coffee enthusiasts, doing things to taste a better product. Do I do things to feel the success?

Chai is staying at home and being at peace but at the cost of being ambitious, coffee is moving to a different city and missing home.

You see how, chai is paired with sutta? It's the admission of guilt, it's the punishing oneself for staying back, for not trying more, it's calming, but it destroys you, makes you live shorter.

I like my coffee with a brownie or a crossiant, it signifies the sweet reward I get for being ambitious, the small break I have. That we regret, because I will put on weight. The trying to quit even this small part of happiness we have. To live better, healthier, longer.

You see when I go back home, I drink chai, because everyone in my family drinks chai. When I am at work I drink coffee, because they have amazing coffee there.

Kolkata has a lot of chai tapris, very less Cafes, no Third Waves or Blue Tokai. Bangalore has amazing coffee, but no tapri culture. It shows the contrast of the cities, people being laid back, looking at art, literature, music in Kolkata vs Making money, building startups, standing up on your own in Bangalore.

It's the shows urbanisation, the breaking of a chai tapri, to open a fancy Cafe, the people moving from Tea to Coffee are the same people moving from Kolkata to Bangalore.

I believe I made a major mistake today. I got a coffee drink from a coffee shop that contained vanilla extract, which has some alcohol content. I searched up the ingredients online for the drink and found that in the company’s ingredients, it did not specifically list vanilla extract so I thought it was safe. While I was drinking it, I did some more digging and I found out that one of the ingredients in the ingredients contained vanilla extract, which has some alcohol content. I automatically stopped drinking the drink and threw it out. I know some people say that vanilla extract is not haram because it doesn’t intoxicate but ever since I knew that it contained some alcohol, I avoided it just to be safe. Are my prayers not going to be accepted for 40 days because I had a suspicion that it had alcohol but I drank it anyway after finding that the ingredients did not show vanilla extract but still having a bit of suspicion that I did more research and found out that it did have vanilla extract? I did make repentance and I sincerely regret it but I’m still panicking a bit.

To whom it may concern:
 
I am writing to express my interest in a position at Dutch Bros. I’m a huge coffee lover (how could I not be, I’m from Colombia) and a passionate customer service representative. With the experience, enthusiasm, and eagerness to learn I bring with me to work I believe I would be an asset to your store.


During my job at The Serpentarium I regularly served a diverse group of customers to meet their needs. Reptiles might seem easy at first, but problems with set-ups can affect their health very easily; it is my job to probe customers to figure out what's wrong and suggest solutions. With the wide variety of animals we carry, I have to be extremely knowledgeable on each animal, as they all have their little intricacies. 


Our mission statement includes making people happy by improving the health of their pets. That’s my main job, making sure the customer leaves the store satisfied and with all their questions answered. As you can imagine, fixing a pet’s health issue ensures they become a customer for life. That’s what I enjoy doing, I want customers to leave with an amazing experience to ensure they become a regular. I’ve even become our Spanish translator.  I have many customers who speak solely Spanish and ask me what my schedule is, as I’m the only person who can help them. 

 This job has sharpened my problem-solving skills, helped me become a better communicator, and given me plenty of experience multi-tasking.


Everytime I visit Dutch Bros it’s an amazing experience, the staff are always so friendly and it keeps me coming back. Why I want to work at Dutch Bros, besides the amazing coffee of course, is because they are in the coffee business AND the relationship business. They’re both integral parts of a healthy store and I love that Dutch Bros puts a lot of focus on both. I would be bringing my experience and skills to Dutch bros to continue this legacy.


Thank you for your consideration, and I am excited to discuss my application further and showcase my love for coffee and the community built around it.

A few months ago, I started a ERP on discord through a prompt seen on a dedicated ERP subreddit. I was glad to have found someone who seemed to be literate, judging by their ad (I answered it).

Over the course of our ERP, several flags were raised, and I have to admit I probably rose some from my part. Mainly, from my part, a lack of stability. I had some IRL big and smaller issues, including a 300 kms move, starting a new job, getting mild depression attack and recently, dealing with my old dad falling and breaking his hip, while being 1 000 kms away. I always tried to be as transparent as possible with my unavailability, but I totally get it pissed off my partner.

None the less, here what bothered me:  
  
1. While being a native English speaker, they have a bad grammar and don't know what punctuation is. It is really something impeding my answer, since I am not an English native speaker, and I sometimes just don't get what they say. I generally go with the overall meaning of the post, but frankly, it bothers me.  
I never addressed this, because I always found it would be unsavoury, given how inconsistant my answering is. I guess I don't want to be the one who is not regular and be a picky princess about wording and grammar.

2. They answered long paragraphes (like reaching the discord word limit (no nitro), with 3 sentences. Or what I think should be sentences, since there is no punctuation. Again, not addressed, but with time, I got tired and gave them 3 sentences answers

3. I did a post about it when it happened, but they tried to play a ERP situation out of nowhere, without warning (the characters were doing ""it"" but they decided their characters would do something out of the blue to mine). This I addressed, and they back tracked without fuss, but the mere fact it happened let me a chilly impression.

4. They don't take into consideration ""hint"" of game play. Fair enough. I did not hint. I wrote it plain. Still, no taken into consideration. I made me felt that whatever I wrote as reaction does not matter, their character would act as they decided.

Despite all, we kept going.  
A few days ago, we decided to branch out to another ERP, with a different couple/setting, but the same universe. They did the starter. My answer that 2 LONG paragraphes, both hitting the discord words limit. I clearly stated my character was sending an anonymous letter with an enigma / hunt game for a meeting, clearly stated their character would have no trouble figuring out the ""when/where"" but would be surprised by the ""who"" (we are doing a rare ship, as the characters canonically don't interact much with one another).

Their answer? Full RP ""Oh, I received a letter from X. Strange. Well, let's meet for coffee.""

No communication whatsoever OCC about not liking my answer or asking me if we could change the setting. Worst, they compliment my lengthy and creative post.

Now, I am lost. I really don't think we are compatible., as much as we are willing to play together. I don't feel valued as a partner. I don't feel my input is ""heard"".

BUT I never addressed any issue, except the kink situation. So I feel I would be a total \*sshole to suddenly tell them I want to stop. Especially since we just started this second thread. But their reaction totally cut my will to write with them.

So, will I be a horrible RP partner, worthy of being feature here as the Villain, if I drop out? It not, how would you approach the subject? Should I be all honest? Make some excuses? Mix excuses with some feedback?

1in777w,https://www.reddit.com/r/PornAddiction/comments/1in777w/how_to_beat_porn_addiction_my_methodology_after/,How to beat porn addiction: my methodology after eight years of suffering,"I've actually been addicted to porn and the PMO cycle for a bit longer than 8 years, but 8 years has become a time frame where I recognise the problem but still can't deal with it. I've stopped using alcohol and nicotine during that time, but PMO, it's a hell of a lot harder. And I want to share what has started to work for me personally, although I'm just at the beginning of the journey and this is the first time I'm discussing it with anyone. I'll provide my system first, and detail it below.

The way I'm struggling with this right now:

1. No fast dopamine: deleted instagram, tiktok and other rubbish.
2. Phone settings set to block all sexual content on the web.
3. My phone is in shades of grey mode, removes unnecessary stimulation and the phone becomes less interesting.
4. I only pick up my phone when I need something and in my head I clearly answer the question ‘Why are you picking it up, man?’ before I pick it up. If the answer is not work, business, personal relationship related - I don't pick it up. IMPORTANT: once the deed is done, the phone is immediately locked and put away.
5. The phone is not in my line of sight while I am working.
6. Do an analysis of your weak moments: in what situations do you break down? What did you feel? What preceded it?
7. In your moments of weakness, replace porn with anything else you find acceptable that makes you happy and helps you get out of a difficult emotional situation. For me, 5 hours of watching a film, reading, a good meal, coffee, talking to friends would be better than 1 hour of porn.
8. Decide where you are going to put the energy you have freed up. This is extremely important because, believe me, porn kills you as an extremely motivated person and you should decide on an endeavour that will have a positive impact on you.

And a little dissection of why what's on this list is what's on this list. In my opinion porn addiction is related to the addiction to the phone / fast dopamine, I would say simply mindless waste of time. All the points about the phone can be adapted to your PC / laptop, because all of the above: tools to achieve some goals. Before using these tools you should determine - what goal am I going to achieve, what problem to solve that I take the phone / sit down at the PC?

It is important to analyse the situations in which you break down, your moments of weakness. You will most likely notice that you are just suffering from something: you may be generally unhappy with your life, dislike yourself, dislike your job or be in some situations. You won't always be able to remove these problems from your life just by realising them, but knowing your weaknesses will allow you to say in these moments ‘Stop, I think I'm about to make a mistake. I can help myself in a different way. I'm going to go do /there's any acceptable substitution for PMO/’.

And it remains to determine the sphere of activity where you will direct the released energy. Porn was killing me as a person who wanted to develop personal relationships, a career, and simply grow in this life. If you don't identify what you want to pursue, you will begin to feel empty along the way from the time you have freed up and empty inside as a serious part of yourself you are trying to rebuild.

1in75yw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1in75yw,Tantanmen,"Here’s my 38% (more like 39%) noodles that I made as Tantanmen. I didn’t have homemade stock so I used powdered chicken broth to make the soup, along with Doubanjian, low sodium miso, nutritional yeast, tahini, @50hertzfoods green Sichuan peppers, garlic, ginger and ground turkey stir fried in lard. The tahini and yeast seized fairly quickly so I added more water but it still turned out more like a traditional Sichuanese dan dan mien than Tantanmen. 

For oils, I used 50Hertz red Sichuan pepper oil as the base and homemade chili oil and mayu drizzled on top for that Jackson Pollock look. In what I hope is my one original contribution to ramen making, I’ve found that you can get around deep frying the garlic for mayu if you get Trader Joe’s ground fermented garlic, grind it in a coffee bean grinder and then mix it with a neutral vegetable oil. Easy peasy and not so greasy! (Sorry)

The blanched spinach looks a little lonely in the bowl as the sole real topping but I had some tired Chinese spinach in the fridge and used that up here. It was actually a nice contrast to all the other rich ingredients. 

All in all a very satisfying bowl of ramen. The noodles could have been a bit snappier but the high hydration handled the richness of the broth quite well. ",15,1739302429.0,ramen,0,1.0,False

**Know Your Audience** – What words would your target users type when searching for your product or service? Think about their pain points and needs.

**Use Keyword Research Tools** – Tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, or SEMrush help you check search volume, competition, and keyword variations.

**Understand Search Intent** – Are users looking for information (informational), making a purchase (transactional), or searching for a specific brand or site (navigational)? Choose keywords that match their intent.

**Spy on Competitors** – Check what keywords your competitors rank for. It’s a great way to spot opportunities and gaps.

**Use Long-Tail Keywords** – These are specific phrases with lower search volume but higher conversion potential (e.g., “best budget gaming laptop under $1000” vs. just “gaming laptop”).

**Balance Volume & Competition** – High-volume keywords are competitive, so mix in medium or low-competition ones for quicker wins.

**Think Local (if applicable)** – If you serve a specific area, add location-based keywords (e.g., ""best coffee shop in Seattle"").

**Track & Optimize** – SEO isn’t set-and-forget. Monitor your rankings and tweak your strategy over time.

Mastering keyword selection helps you rank higher, attract the right audience, and grow your site’s traffic. What’s your go-to keyword research strategy?

1. Some girls suggest very high end restaurants on a first date. These are poor food hunters. They try to do fine dining on your money. As long as you keep paying, they keep going on dates. But nothing progresses emotionally from their side. My advice would be: NEVER take a girl on fine dining on first date, do a coffee date instead. Also if the girl isnt interested in paying her share on second date, just RUN.
2. Another girl wanted me to pay for her nail work, after first date, before agreeing on second date. I am sure she had another date scheduled next afternoon and she wanted to get prepared on my money for that, lol.
3. Crypto scammers are common. They take your number and communicate off the app. As soon as they get your number, they unmatch you so that you cannot report their profile. Some signs these scammers show are : they run aunts business, occational crypto trader making profit, travelling on business trips, regular gym/fine dining photos and golf player. Also their profile photos are blurry or not focusing the face clearly. They always show reasons to delay a video call or in-person date. Also these scammers text too much and tend to be very sugary. they instantly fall in love and pretends that you are their whole world. Some of them never sleeps, i mean seems online all the time.

He survived wolf attacks in the woods, tense encounters with cannibals who set up a base in a castle, and even a run-in with a landmine and a player who spared him but took all his gear and left him to crawl to the nearest town to survive. He looted a number of mil bases, and had a M16, a mosin, lots of ammo and food, a plate carrier, and even half a set of NBC gear. 

Today I hopped on for a quick morning loot run in a mil base I logged off near. The server has like 11 players at this point. Very much off-peak hours, so I'm feeling pretty safe.

I see a heli crash in the distance, and get excited to hopefully find some juicy stuff. Approached the heli like a fool, drinking a coffee and completely distracted, before I see someone laying down next to the heli as I get close. I didn't even have my M16 out. My heart drops and 0.5 seconds later, ""You are dead"".

I didn't even react or say anything. Just turned my computer off and went to work...... Fuck this game. Feels like so much time wasted.

Anyways can't wait to get home from work and do it all again with a new survivor!!:)  this time I won't let my guard down!

Back in 2017 I moved into my first new bachelor apartment and I had issues with my neighbor downstairs. I ended up calling the cops on him one night cause he inappropriately touched me. So the cop came he was very charming and good looking he was exactly my type. Long story short he arrests the guy and the guy was put in jail. I wanted to give him a rose than I had but he couldn't accept my gifts.  Later on months go by and I got into some activity that I shouldn't have. I won't get into it but I ended up getting a text message from a number and they said they couldn't tell me who it was that I had to figure it out. But they were upset with what I was doing. But they told me I had met him not too long ago and thought he was very hot so I figured out it was the cop messaging me and I asked specific questions to see if it was him that no one else would know and he answered them. So I'm thinking it was him and we are talking. Long story short he was telling me he's schizophrenic has hepatitis b and other stuff that I won't mention. I was trying to him help him that night we spoke if it was him. Than he said he was going to destroy everything I ever owned but the next day apologized and said he was drunk. So I left it alone. Months go by and I move into my new apartment. This is where it gets creepy. I saw him in my building parking lot and he had a very evil smile on him but didn't look human. Than my landlord came up to me and said a cop came into my apartment and was searching through all my stuff crying on my couch saying he's very worried about me and I go into my apartment and yes everything was tossed around. I also forgot to mention before I moved into my new place I had arguments with my previous landlord and called the cop station. The cop I met answered the phone. Than we spoke a bit and he suddenly three ways my old social worker on the phone and we are having a three way and I'm like how do you guys even know eachother ? But I do remember telling him that I was in love with my social worker and I only give the cop his name not where he lived. And the cop was telling him things about me. And I was embarrassed on the phone. And the cop asked me. Are you going to tell anyone what I spoke to you about ? And I said no. But accidentally told the social worker on the other line that he has schizophrenia and the cop was like do you find it funny ? What if it happened to you ? 

Well after I move into my new place I'm getting stalked by the cop. Months go by as I'm living there and strange things were happening. Someone trying to open my door in the middle of the night. Anyway. I'm trying to get on medication for my anxiety. They ended up putting me on lyrica and I ended up having a psychosis. I ran out of my apartment thinking people were coming in there to kill me. I went into the homeless shelter and woke up to a demonic voice that took a form of my sister and I heard her voice and me and my sister are not on good terms. I seen a big full moon. Than someone in my room with the lights off was laughing very evil and hysterically and suddenly took a form of a man and was waving it me it was very creepy. Than I saw black eyes on someone and someone eyes were rolling at the back of their head and it didn't seem human. Than I also saw someone with red eyes speaking in a demonic voice to me. Also someone took a form of my sister telling me how strong I am. I saw alot more stuff too but trying to get to the point. During my psychosis I had an image of my sister talking to me telling me I'm going through a psychosis but in a very annoying voice but that's how I figured I was going through a psychosis my first time going through all of this and that's where it ended and I went to the hospital. I was going through a psychosis for three months straight and lost everything. 



Afterwards I move into my dad's house and covid  began. Stayed at my dad's for three years. Stopped taking my pills cause I figured nothing was wrong with me. Than in 2022 a friend of mine passed away it was really sad and I was really depressed. So one day I was not doing good and called the cops on myself cause I was really depressed about his death wishing god would take my life instead of his. Than one day I ended up hearing my friend who passed away, his voice in my ear. And it happened twice. than at night time it was very late at night I asked God to show me a sign if he's real. Than the church bells rang at close to 12 am at night. And the church bells never ring at that time usually on Sunday during the day. Than I went outside looked at the moon and said "" do you find it funny what I'm going through "" and the moon suddenly disappeared. So I figured they didn't find it funny. But my hallucinations started again and this is where I thought I was god. Long story short I started hallucinating, one night I even felt like I should poke my eye out. But the next day I was begging for help and the sun appeared next to me really big and bright and I felt like I was healed. Than I figured I was going through another psychosis so I went to the hospital. It was a very eerie feeling too. And I saw people with black eyes that looked demonic. The psychiatrist that came to see me said in her exact words "" we were good business partners at one point "" I don't even know who she is. I just saw alot of crazy stuff than moved out of my dad's and lived somewhere else and got help. Forgot to mention when I was at the hospital I seen the cop again and it looked like him but in a different form and he just kept staring at me with black eyes. Than I had an image in my head that I was talking to myself and I said "" she's tricking you "" than later on I was sleeping and heard a man's voice saying "" I just like to scare her "" 


Later on I move into a new place.  Than months go by and I ended up moving and becoming homeless again. Forgot to take my meds too. So went through another psychosis. And one night I was really upset and I was sitting infront of a coffee shop when there was no one there and it was closed. I was yelling at karma at the time really upset and I was also facing a hotel where the windows were facing me. And once I was yelling at karma I saw three tall black figures at the hotel windows facing me and they were all men waving at me very scary and for a good few minutes. Wasn't like a human. 


I just wanna know is something out there trying to ruin my life ? Or give me a sign ? The first time it happened I wasn't in a good state and planning on moving anyway. This only happens when I plan to leave. And I have asked whatever out there to give me a sign. The last time it happened to me I did ask for a sign that this is all real. 

How would you interpret this experience. Is this a good experience or a bad one ? I think what I'm seeing and hearing is all real. It's more than just a psychosis 

Is something out there trying to ruin my life ?

1in71md,https://i.redd.it/8qbml4b8akie1.jpeg,Diving in face first...,"I'm ""that guy"" who will gladly accept a cigar and genuinely enjoy it. I'd pocket the neck band and attempt to find the same cigars for next time I'm with that person for drinks. I'll buy a couple from the humidor at random while at Total Wine to have on hand for golfing. I had an okish cutter and relied on stick matches. However I got to the point where I was enjoying it enough to start trying to understand the differences and find things I like. So with a buddies recommendation and the fortune of living near Ybor City, I ran down to La Farina to try my luck. 



La Farina was an amazing experience, the owner and face of the company was super nice and explained the difference categories of cigars on hand without overloadibg me with info. They roll all their own cigars and are incredibly friendly. She made me a cuban coffee while I went through picking out my cigars which was absolutely incredible. After picking out the cigars she showed me around the store and the nice sheltered patio out back. Completely inviting and polar opposite of the cigar international experience which wasn't bad but very super market feeling. I genuinely hope this is common in the cigar world because it was such a good experience and I tend to gravitate to hobbies and communities that are friendly and welcoming to noobs like me. Anyways, the prices vary from $8-$20 and probably higher but they offer 20 of your choice for $150 which I went for as it seems to be a good deal. I tried to get a variety of different cigars to try. So now my question is how did I do? I'm hoping I got a good variety.

I also picked up a xikar v cutter and triple lighter which is such a huge upgrade. Oh and a herd 2 finger aluminum ashtray. It's not ideal but works well enough for now. I'm still looking for the perfect humidor for my needs, but what else should I pick up in my journey. I see people recommend different things around here so figured I'd ask. Thanks for all the info I've already got by lurking, you guys are great.

We met in my first semester of college. She was in my first class very early in the morning. She was very chatty with everyone but I didnt talk to anyone. She has a kid and was tired so I bought her a coffee and donut and then she decided we had to be friends. I really enjoyed that class and talking with my classmates (very small group).

But now  i’m in my 2nd year. We would text sometimes but didnt meet up or hang out. But she works at the college as a student worker and works for my family friend, so she would send messages to me through the friend. Occasionally, we saw each other at college and she always gave me a hug. She asked me a while ago to join our college senate that she is a part of (high position) so we could hang out more. I didn’t want to but I told her I would.

I’m a horrible friend. I dont know how to be friends with people. I’m scared of being perceived. When people perceive me, they realize i’m a person and i fuck up. My therapist said it’s a fear of abandonment.

I stand at senate events/meetings like an idiot. I think of things to say but I cant actually say it. I wait to be initiated before I do anything. I look stupid and helpless. I dont know why she keeps talking to me, im just another responsibility for her. I want to talk to everyone, I want to become friendly with my group but I cant figure out how. I just cant carry a convo.

I have dissociation. I’m familiar with not feeling anything. But lately, i’m being pushed into communicating and interacting with outsiders and constantly i’m on the verge of a panic attack. I cant drop senate, she wanted me to join. But i’m worthless in it. Idk what the hell i’m doing. i want to drop everything and run away. i just want you graduate and get the hell out. 

she’s so sweet and she’s nice and she’s smart and an incredible friend. it’s just me.

My fingers and especially toes are always cold, with one or two toes that go numb at times. 

Three weeks ago today I went in to a last minute appointment with my PC because I was worried about carpal tunnel, the doc and I agree this is unlikely as I don’t have the localized numbness and tests they performed did not point towards it. 

After examination Doc was pretty convinced I was experiencing rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, gave me a steroid pack, and referred me to a rheumatologist. I was out of work (welder/fabricator) for the rest of that week. 

I worked the entire week after, though by that Friday I was struggling so bad just to put my boots on that I coordinated some time off to figure out just what the heck is wrong with me. I’ve been out since last Monday and the entire week my problems grew worse. Hands and feet swelling like balloons and stiff/painful every single morning, which slowly improves through most of the day (to a point) and starts back up in the evenings.

Of course, my appointment with the rheumatologist doc was today, and the swelling has receded “almost” entirely. I still have some swelling at the base of my hands and the balls of my feet, but I wouldnt call it obvious to anyone they aren’t attached to. Doc asked a lot of the same standard questions, medical history, length of symptoms, etc and after a brief examination concluded an absence of inflammation due to my cold fingers/toes and sent me for labs.

Results were nearly immediate, normal across the board except for MPV of 8 (within normal range according to Google, but outside the 9.4-12.4 range on my results. I also had a glucose of 106 but that seems to be within the bounds of a non-fasting draw.

I’m out of work, in pain, and more than a little worried about my life/quality of, and I just don’t know what to do.

Metrics: 

29M, 6’0” ~200, BMI ~26

I have not smoked a cigarette in almost two years but I do vape, and regularly partake of the electric cabbage.

My caffeine take is less than it used to be, I have maybe one energy drink/coffee every 1-2 days.

My job is very physically demanding, and I’d say it keeps me fitter than most but I don’t get much cardio.

Meds:

Adderall - 30mg XR once daily, 10mg instant in the afternoon

Sertraline - 100mg once daily

Lorazepam - 1mg as needed for anxiety (was 1-3/week but has climbed to ~4-5 a week as worsening pain/not working has triggered my anxiety)

Meloxicam - 15mg once daily

Tylenol - as needed up to 4000mg/day according to Doc

Symptoms:

Hands/Fingers/Wrist - bilateral pain usually accompanied swelling, after days of intense pain and now receded swelling there are new consistent pains in the base knuckles of both thumbs, a persistent ache in the wrists and fingers. What was previously wrist fatigue after/during use has become constant, and there is a persistent feeling of discomfort at certain ranges of motion that feel like if the position is held or pushed further it *will* hurt.

Morning stiffness daily, without interruption for almost a month.

Hands consistently cold and difficult to warm with no discoloration present with Raynaud’s.

Minor/soft ganglion cyst on right wrist noted by RA specialist.

Feet/Ankles - Constant pain in the balls of the feet and especially at the base joints of/between the toes where small and very painful muscle knots form.

Edema is concurrent with hands. Bilateral and occurring/receding at the same time as the hands.

Morning stiffness daily.

Impossible to keep warm, toes consistently freezing and occasionally numb.

Additional: Not sure if caused by condition or by untreated symptoms, but I’m noticing radiating pain/stiffness in my forearms as well as my ankles/calves.

During the worst of the pain I also experienced intense fatigue for a day or two.

Relief methods (non medication) - Hot Water soaks provide temporary relief, and regular light stretching has helped to temporarily relieve stiffness but no applied method is persistent/effective.

Rest/light use has not improved symptoms.

Wtf is wrong with me and why are all my labs normal, how do I get relief and back to work

It came to a point where I started thinking about her throughout the day, and it was weird for me because I didn’t have had that feeling for such a long time (of course there’s always one that I find sweet, or beautiful, but not like it was with her) I literally just didn’t have the courage to go up to her, and ask her anything.

Fast forward a month ago, I was back in the gym because I didn’t go for almost 1 month due to having a flu, and then Christmas came around, and New Years and so on. And on this first day when I went back to the gym, I saw a friend of mine and kinda greeted him from far by making a funny face, and she was walking and passed by him and I didn’t see her because I was looking at him, so to me she was a blur. So when I made the funny face, she thought I was making the face to her and she pointed at herself as to ask if I was talking to her, and then I realized it was her. Mind you, in this moment I had a million thoughts and I was so nervous because it was so out of the blue, and I then told her that I wasn’t doing that face to her, but to my friend, and then I took the opportunity and wished her a nice workout. Oh, I have to mention that the months before she also saw me a few times and also looked at me. Basically I always have a smile on my face, so the times she looked at me and we looked at each other, we also smiled at each other, but I always thought she’s way out of my league… so on this day we then got to talk, and I flat out told her (while being shy, fully blushed) that I think she’s really beautiful, and she blushed as well, and thanked me a lot and she complimented me back by saying I was also very beautiful, and sexy and so on and yada yada yada.. I found out she’s a foreigner, and she would leave in 1 month.

So this led me to ask her out on a date. I wasn’t sure because she’ll leave, but I also didn’t wanna lose the opportunity, and also I didn’t want to be in a stage later in my life where I’d ask myself: “ What if..?”. I asked her out through a message, and I wanted to do it in person, but we were always missing each other at the gym because she had other schedules probably at work and so on, so I just sent her a video asking her out. I suggested we could go for dinner, a coffee or drinks and so on, and she answered that I was really cute, and she’d like to go on that date, and Dinner sounds great. I was over the moon of the amount of happiness I was feeling in that moment, and I asked her when is the best time for her (this was last week). She told me she was busy last week but this week would work, and I thought great, and she also asked when it would work for me this week. I gave her the answer through video on Friday, and she saw the video, but didn’t answer for the whole weekend. Yesterday (Monday) I just messaged her asking if she had a great weekend, and that I hope she’s fine. Seen, ghosted. I mean, I think she will leave this week, and go back to her country, and it doesn’t really look good if she didn’t answer me yet, right?

I will not send anymore messages now, because I don’t want to be pushy and a pain in the a**. But is this the right thing to do? What do you all think?

1in6huk,https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1in6huk/cant_seem_to_get_back_into_v3/,Can't seem to get back into V3,"Content warning: I wrote a lot.

Last spring, I bought V3 and played over 1,000 hours of vanilla (mostly over the summer, as I was between jobs in education). I picked up all the DLCs during RTS week for the sale but didn't have time to really play again until the past week (two family members tested positive for covid, so I've been in quarantine). Despite a number of clear improvements, I'm a bit disappointed.

Passing laws was always a tedious, grind-laden aspect of the game, but it feels quite a bit worse to me now. I haven't combed through the dev diaries, but I find it very hard to believe that pumping radicalism to pass laws is an intended gameplay pattern. I don't want it to be as trivial as slotting in new laws, but I don't want the best/only effective tools to be cheese and save scum.

To my thinking, V3 is missing an *inter-* active system for affecting public opinion. Clicking suppress/bolster and slotting in agitators is about as exciting as brushing my teeth. I'd love to see a ""public opinion campaign"" decision that might work a bit like the expeditions. I'd envision the player choosing a particular law, and then some character in their country to act as a proponent or opponent of that law in a sort of mini quest event chain. Expeditions can become as repetitive as anything else, but at least that kind of mini-quest offers continuing player involvement, a somewhat more nuanced set of choices for the player to make, another way for your characters' traits to interact with event outcomes, a way to increase public support for ongoing wars, and a rare opportunity to 'play as' a character other than your ruler.

In general I'd love to see more roles for characters and ways to slot them in to your nation. Why can't companies have a leader slot? Not seeing John D. Rockefeller in charge of Standard Oil is a bit disappointing. You could extend the idea to major universities and cultural institutions, agricultural and resource consortia, etc. V3 is about building, but I really want more opportunities for building something memorable and not just more of the same factories. As it stands, we have two canals, one skyscraper, and a very small number of buildable monuments. And actually, on this topic, the ""survey a skyscraper site"" decision makes so much more sense to me as the way to create a new company; currently it can be frustrating to found companies under LF because you can't always maintain national ownership of the required buildings. A 'survey' decision makes a lot of sense to me, as you aren't just building a structure, you're possibly founding a whole new company town and all the infrastructure associated with it. And that, in turn, offers the opportunity for historically themed events like preventing (or allowing) company scrip. Down the line, managing monopolies and trust busting could become a game mechanic as well.

Whatever fix the issue of founding companies ends up getting, I'd really love to see unique building projects. There could be public works projects to dredge rivers and harbors, improving their MAPI and other utilities, for example. (And I'm not even trying to get into things that would make a good DLC, like archaeological digs). I imagine stuff like this is scrawled on an idea board somewhere in PDX's offices.

Starting a new run still feels very samey. I only got through half a run with 1.8, but I tried to start 5 or 6. Of course different nations have different starting conditions. In most cases you have a set of unique brush fires to put out, but once you do the only thing that really matters in V3 is construction. It's not even a very good way to simulate construction. You don't use laborers in Silesia or Pennsylvania to build things across the country or the world, you'd hire local laborers. I don't know how to implement something more realistic, but I imagine it might somehow involve making construction a local resource. I imagine that's been discussed and dismissed as far too complicated to implement, but as it stands, my entire early gameplay pattern revolves around building up construction/MAPI states and as little else as I can get away with. Not to put too fine a point on it, but it's pretty boring at this point.

When I imagined getting back into another V3 binge, I was picturing things like playing Brazil to corner the global market on coffee, or buying up most of the world's steel to prevent enemy states from being able to wage war. I know they plan to work on trade in the coming updates--that's part of why I started playing again. I wanted to get a feel for the new game systems before seeing if the trade overhaul makes that side of the game fun and interesting. MAPI makes it really difficult to maintain a competitive edge in trade, but I think it's also the case that setting up a new industry is trivially easy in V3, but in reality establishing a crop for the first time in a region isn't trivial or straightforward. The qualifications system seems to be more challenging in the current build, but it doesn't really seem to capture the difficulty of establishing an industrial-scale economic sector in a state/region for the first time. That initial hurdle in setting up a new industry should be part of what makes trade valuable. As it stands it doesn't feel like trade is a bona fide opportunity, so much as a pressure valve for over- and under- production in your home country (and diplomacy tool--hopefully any automation tools also allow for prioritizing trade with a particular nation, even if it's less profitable).

Anyway, it's not my intent to come off as whiny or melodramatic. I love the depth of V3's economy, but I hate how often I feel railroaded into the same gameplay patterns. I don't want to spurn all the work the devs have put into making the economic simulation both broadly authentic and stable enough to run on my 6-year-old laptop. I wouldn't have bothered writing all this if I didn't still love the game on some level, and I do intend to offer this feedback on the official PDX forums (the crucible of reddit comments will let me know if I've missed some obvious game mechanic that might help).

In the mean time I should probably explore some mods. I usually don't like going too deep into mods for games that get so many regular updates, but I haven't stopped craving a grand strategy binge. So I'm open to recommendations if anyone has any, especially if they relate to anything I've mentioned above.",6,1739300817.0,victoria3,0,1.0,False

Nakilala ko kse ung ka date ko sa isang dating app.  Btw Im working as a cyber security professional. We’ve been talking on Bumb then later na lipat kme sa ig and fb super sweet and clingy nya to the point na madali kang ma ffall.

 
4 days na kameng naguusap and all of sudden na ghost nya ko kse sobrang busy nya daw sa school, after 1 week na pag aantay saknya,  susuko na sana ako eh, she replied to my messages and nag sorry naman sya for ghosting me, inunfollow nya kse ako sa ig, sabi nya na babawi daw sya saken and di nya sinasadya ung pang gghost nya kse busy sya and mababa lang daw yung social battery nya.

 Moving forward, napapansin ko palagi puro fastfoods ang kinakain nya which is naka ka off para saken, med student sya dapat nga mas health conscious sya and  di rin sya marunong magluto. 

We’ve decided to schedule our meetup sa isang coffee shop around fairview bale kinabukasan yon,  pero gabi palang napagdesisyunan ko na imeet sya, binilhan ko kse sya ng matinong dinner, whole foods ba. 

Nag ask ako sknya if anong fave nyang beverage sa zus coffee, kunwari para lang saken ung bbilhin ko pero hndi nya alam binilhan ko na din sya para ipapartner nya sa dinner nya.

Nung nakarating nako sa location near sa dorm nya, i told her na binilhan ko sya ng food and drinks pra malamnan ng maayos ang sikmura nya at makapag focus sya maayos sa studies nya. She’s thankful naman and medyo nahihiya hiya pa nga nung nag meet na kame at iaabot ko na ung food sknya. 

 Then kinabukasan, nag meet kme sa cafe she plans to study also ako din nag rreview for upcoming exam certifications. On that day she told me na kkb nlng muna nahhiya daw sya, sabi ko okay lang naman yun, its on me. Investment ko yun sayo, bawi ka nlng saken pag naka graduate and may work ka na. 

Lahat ng gastos is from my pocket, no issue naman kse understandable na budgeted pera ng mga student eh so okay lang saken. The date was successfully okay, i make sure na wla syang gastos haha simpleng date lang naman yon hndi yung pang marangya.

After a few days, we’re doing good naman nag bakasyon muna sya dun sa fam nya sa rizal pra mag celebrate ng pasko at bagong taon, so we’re updating each other naman and nakakapagusap naman kami sometimes busy lng sya sakanila mdami daw gawain at inaasikaso. Sguro 3 to 4 days ang gap sa mga replied messages nya saken, tho understandable naman need nyang tumulong sa mga gawaing bahay.

Then sabi nya na babawi daw sya after nya makabalik sa dorm and magkkita daw uli kame kse namimiss na daw namin isat isa HAHAHA.

Always waiting lang ako sa reply nya kahit ilang araw pa ang abutin. kaso ung message na natanggap ko  sakanya iba na haha, ang sabi nya saken, bumagsak daw sya sa isa sa mga major subject nya, so sa ngayon we should stop dating muna. Hindi nya raw kaya pagsabayin ang studies at paglalandi saken.

May nagawa ba akong mali? Masyado ba’ko nag iinsist? May nakaranas naba sainyo nang ganito? Haha ayoko lang sana mag overthink or maparanoid bakit naging dahilan yung pag bagsak sa major subject and studies nya para mag stop kami sa dating stage namin. What i did is to support her studies naman, binibigyan ko sya ng mahabang oras para sa pagaaral nya, di naman ako demanding sa time, lagi ko syang pinapayuhan na mag aral mabuti unahin ang pag aaral at pag rreview kesa sa gumala ksama ang friends nya.",5,1739300760.0,MayConfessionAko,4,1.0,False

As our first experience for cruises, we booked a trip on MSC for early March from Miami to Bahama, 4 days.

After booking done, which looked like a good deal, now I was going to get the required packages! And SURPRISE 😢

The packages they offer is like:

Junior package: mostly coffee and soft drinks, I believe mostly for kids (check the photos)

And the first one which comes with Alcohol is $248/adult. (The third photo)

And there is a term says:

PACKAGES ARE SOLD ON A PER CRUISE BASIS AND NOT A PER DAY OR ANY OTHER BASIS. PRICING APPLIES TO EACH DAY OF THE CRUISE, EXCEPT FOR DISEMBARKATION DAY.

Me andy wife drink hard liquor, maybe also some beer or wine in occasion too. 

The price for packages , if I'm not mistaken will be considered daily, so $248*4 comes to a grant per each of us. We enjoy drinking, but we are not alcoholic, that doesn't make sense to me to spend 2k on drinks plus 2x$300 for kids drink. 

Am I missing something? Is the any misuderstanding from me?

If not, if we don't get the package, how is the alcohol pricing in the bars of the cruise if we decide to have some?

What about kids, how is the pricing for their drinks, ice cream or ... 

I saw even water bottles were on the lists for the kids package. What does it mean? If they get tursty we have to have a package for them and there is no drinking water there?

Any advice would be appreciated. 

I'm sorry if my questions may look stupid, but it's our first time and we are not familiar with these.

1in69d1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1in69d1/my_34m_exwifes_31f_best_friend_29f_has_been/,My (34M) Ex-Wife's (31F) Best Friend (29F) has been reaching out to me after 2 years,"My ex-wife and I were together for 8 years before separating two years ago. The end came unexpectedly during our anniversary while I was visiting her abroad where she was pursuing her masters. She never gave a clear reason for wanting the divorce, only saying she ""loves me but isn't in love with me."" While I suspected there might have been someone else (her sister posted a video of her with someone just 2 months after our separation), I chose not to dig deeper. Though the divorce started amicably, it turned contentious, leading me to handle everything through my lawyer. During that first year, she kept trying to maintain casual contact, asking to meet for coffee and checking in on me, but I kept my distance as I was still healing. Our last interaction a year ago ended in an argument over money when she came to pick up some items.

Throughout our marriage, my ex had a childhood best friend (Z) whose family had close ties with hers since their university days. While Z was always friendly during our occasional visits to her country or when she visited us, our relationship was strictly surface-level. We never had independent conversations beyond me asking for gift advice for my ex. Interestingly, my ex would sometimes criticize Z to me, calling Z immature and seemingly jealous of Z's lifestyle – similar to how she'd spoken about another childhood friend she suddenly cut off.

Two months ago, Z unexpectedly texted me – our first communication since the separation. She needed help with receiving a package of important documents in the US, explaining she couldn't ask my ex because they'd had a falling out. During our subsequent phone call, Z became emotional, revealing that my ex had changed drastically after our separation. According to Z, my ex had become defensive, condescending, and even screamed at Z's mother during a family gathering over living arrangements. Z was particularly hurt because she didn't learn about our separation until months after it happened, and my ex refused to discuss it. She cried while expressing how my ex seemed happier when we were together and asked about my ex's mental health. I kept my response neutral, simply stating that the person I knew then seems very different now.

Since that conversation, Z's behavior has shifted noticeably. She's been regularly reaching out on Instagram, sending reels, and persistently following up even when I don't respond for weeks. She's suggested meeting for coffee and wants to catch up whenever she's in my city or if I'm in Europe. The level of communication we've had in these past two months surpasses our entire interaction during my 8-year marriage. I find it interesting that now she wants to hang out whenever I am in Europe or when she comes down to my city. She just thanked me for restaurant recommendations she used during her recent trip, and continues to maintain contact despite my slow responses.

I think Z is a great person, and I'm genuinely curious to see where this could develop naturally. While I never had romantic feelings for her during my marriage, her recent attention and persistence has me wondering about her intentions. To be completely honest, she's stunning - the kind of person who turns heads when she walks into a room, and probably way above my dating league. But that's what makes her recent interest even more confusing. I'm not sure how to navigate this situation without making things awkward or potentially misreading signals. Is this just a friendship from shared experience with my ex, or could there be something more - perhaps my ex is fishing for information about me or is she interested? I'd appreciate any advice, thanks!!

TL:DR My ex-wife’s childhood best friend (Z) randomly reached out two months ago for a favor, then opened up about how my ex has changed since our divorce. Since then, she’s been unusually persistent—sending messages, Instagram reels, and suggesting meetups, way more than we ever interacted during my marriage.

I’m not sure if she’s just looking for friendship over our shared connection with my ex, fishing for info, or if there’s actually something more. Her sudden attention has me confused. I’m curious but don’t want to misread the situation or make things awkward. Not sure how to play this.",13,1739300280.0,relationship_advice,35,0.93,False

Ok I just looked up the definition and I now know this is what I have. I used to think agoraphobia was just fear of leaving the home, but I go out and get coffee or go to doc appts often and I mostly do ok with that. 

But it’s not just being afraid to leave home, it’s fear of being somewhere without an easy escape, etc, and that describes me to a tee:

“Agoraphobia (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder. Agoraphobia involves fearing and avoiding places or situations that might cause panic and feelings of being trapped, helpless or embarrassed. You may fear an actual or upcoming situation. For example, you may fear using public transportation, being in open or enclosed spaces, standing in line, or being in a crowd.

The anxiety is caused by fear that there's no easy way to escape or get help if the anxiety gets overwhelming. You may avoid situations because of fears such as getting lost, falling, or having diarrhea and not being able to get to a bathroom. Most people who have agoraphobia develop it after having one or more panic attacks, causing them to worry about having another attack. They then avoid the places where it may happen again.”",6,1739300276.0,Agoraphobia,2,1.0,False

It seems like outie Irv has a plan to stay awake as much as possible (coffee) and send a message to innie Irv (painting). Maybe the way he is checking for this is deductions to the paycheck.

I bought a 2013 chevy equinox 6 months ago with 89k miles on it, I’ve driven it up to like 91k. For the entire time I’ve driven it I never got any check engine or oil lights or service warnings. The car fax indicated that it had a full service before I purchased it. No other indications of mechanical problems until a couple days ago. I didn’t have it serviced because I figured I’d get a notification for it on the dash.

A couple days ago the car sputtered a bit while starting up, but then drove fine. I figured it was because of the cold snap we have right now. The next day I drove it to a coffee shop, no problems, got back in and it started up, sputtered heavily once I started driving, so I shut it off and rolled it into a parking spot. After that it failed to turn over. No seriously scary sounds, it just wouldn’t turn over. 

We checked the battery, no problem. We then checked the oil and found that the dip stick was bone dry. I somehow had driven down the oil without tripping any sensor or having any other obvious mechanical problems. So I added 3 quarts of oil right there and tried to start it back up. Nothing.

We tried to get it to start repeatedly while having the battery hooked up to a jumpstarter (which in hindsight maybe wasn’t smart). As we kept trying, the engine sound got quieter and quieter, but still no clanking noises, just whirring and solenoid clicking. I left it parked and came back the next morning to have it towed to a mechanic. Before getting it towed I tried starting it again and the engine noise was super quiet, just whirring.

The mechanic called me back and says that theres no compression in any of the cylinders and therefore I need to replace the whole engine. I’m getting it towed to a chevy dealership for a more serious second opinion.

I’ve called up a couple friends and everyone says that it sounds like my fuel pump is dead or the fuel line is blocked. That would explain why the sound the engine was making slowly got quieter, as it burned off what gas was left. It was unclear to me over the phone whether or not the mechanics had properly taken a look at the fuel line or the pump, but for certain there are no error codes or anything. The car thinks it’s fine.

An engine replacement would cost me almost as much as the car itself, so if you guys have any answers that’d be great. I’m getting it taken to a chevy dealership regardless.",1,1739300048.0,AskAMechanic,0,1.0,False

I have been struggling to find/stick with a dentist for the past decade for a variety of reasons. Mainly my own depression and moving states but also because of their poor regard during consultation/treatment. I scheduled with a new dentist and had our consultation today. She was a little alarmed at the state of my teeth (handful of cavities, some gum recession) and when I asked what I could do differently in the meantime I brought up the topic of toothpaste. As soon as I told her I was using Sensodyne anti cavity she told me that was wrong and I shouldn’t use it more than twice per week because it doesn’t prevent cavity formation. I was shocked, but didn’t let her know that. I thought Sensodyne pronamel comes highly recommended?

My oral hygiene routine:

Waterpik before brushing 
Electric toothbrush most days/manual if I’m feeling tired or overstimulated 
Brush 2x per day
PerioBrite xylitol mouthwash at night after brushing 

She said I must eat a lot of sugary foods/drink soda. I told her I don’t drink any soda or carbonated beverages. Just black coffee (occasional cappuccino) and water. I do eat dark chocolate somewhat regularly. But I don’t consume junk food or sticky starches that would likely remain on my teeth. I have a balanced diet of mostly whole foods. 


Can someone help me here? I had 7 cavities on this visit but I don’t know if these are old cavities from my depression episodes years ago? There was a point where I didn’t see a dentist for a 5 year stretch and I have only been seeing dentists intermittently for the past decade. I don’t want my teeth to get any worse.

I go to a small college about 1800 students, so everybody somewhat knows everybody, but there is this girl that has really caught my eye from bio class (we are both freshmen).

We follow each other on Instagram, so I could reach out that way, but I don't know if that's ""socially acceptable"" these days without looking like a creep. or do I just need to suck it up and ask her in person?

I have been in many serious relationships throughout adulthood, several of which have led to the guy proposing marriage. Mostly, I declined. Occasionally I said yes but later we broke up. I have only been married once and have been happily divorced for many years. I am in a long-term partnership of 8 years and am happy in that relationship.

I have tried talking to my GFs about this weird phenom but they don't have the same experiences as me - fewer partners, fewer serious relationships, etc., and nobody that comes back to bug them decades later. This has happened to me several times and the latest instance is very confusing and upsetting so I'm trying to understand why this keeps happening.

Guys I was involved with, even only for a few months, seem to work super hard to track me down online and then contact me YEARS after we broke up, wanting to meet up with me. I would say this has happened with 6 different guys that I haven't talked to for at least 10 if not 20 or more years. At least one of them was someone who wanted to apologize for how shitty he had been to me when we were dating, which was fine and I appreciated that. Most of the others seemingly just want to say hi and catch up. I don't get this, but have agreed on occasion.

I have been exceedingly clear up front that if they are looking to hit on me or something I am 100% not interested, and they swear that's not why. So I have met a few of them for a cup of coffee or a drink, for example, if they are passing through town (most of these guys now live in other states). It's cordial, and I guess I don't mind reminiscing with someone I used to know for an hour but I always got the feeling once I met them that they were, in fact, hoping to hook up even though I'd been very clear that is not in the cards. IDK if they are just testing the waters or what, but after these single meet-ups I've made it clear I consider our business finished, I don't wish to reminisce further, I wish them well and don't care to hear from them again, and then they comply.

The latest one I really do not get. This was a guy I dated in high school for about a year, it was a typical HS relationship. Once we went to college, things ended quickly. He was mad that I wanted to move on and date other people and abruptly stopped talking to me, which was perfectly fine. I never thought about him all these many long years, we had little in common and live in different states. I do not wish to speak to him and have nothing to say. I'm not mad, I just don't care and I moved on. High school was 37 years ago, you know? 

A couple years ago he started attempting to contact me. He found me on Twitter and messaged me, which I did not accept and I blocked him. I do not want to talk to him. I do not want to reminisce, like it was LONG TIME ago and I do not care, I am tired of indulging all this reminiscing about relationships I don't think of that fondly. He then found me through my professional website and emailed me, which I blocked. I am old and am still on Facebook, and suddenly got a friend request about a year ago from his brother, who I do not know AT ALL and have no desire to talk to. I did not accept that request. I think he also commented on an old blog I used to run and I blocked him there too. Like there have been multiple attempts to contact me over the last two years. A few days ago, he created a new Insta account specifically to contact me and tell me that I am ""the most important person in his life."" HUH? Someone you haven't talked to for 37 years? 

I specifically told him to stop trying to contact me and leave me alone. Hopefully this will work.

But what is the point here? Why is this happening? Why would you pester someone who clearly does not want to engage in any way, shape or form with you for two years, and why would you say someone you haven't spoken to in 37 years is ""the most important person in your life?""",0,1739299643.0,AskMenAdvice,12,0.5,False
1in5z9a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1in5z9a,Got my shady former bosses in trouble with the state for trying to prevent us from discussing pay.,"I feel like y'all would get a kick out of this. 

I live in New Jersey, USA. Before I became certified in the field that I currently work in, I worked at preschools and daycares to gain experience working with children. This one was a franchise of a corporate chain. The owners were horrible. They didn't even have backgrounds in group childcare or education. They used to own fast food restaurants before diving into the childcare/ECE industry. They opened their first franchise and it became very successful, so they bought the one that I worked at from the previous owner. 

I didn't even want to work there, but I was so desperate for work at the time and took their offer. Even in the interview, they pulled a bait and switch. They tried to offer me the state minimum wage, despite advertising on Indeed that the pay was above that. I had also been making more at my previous job. I called them out on this and negotiated my pay up to what I thought to be a decent wage at the time. 

Well, during my first week, I made conversation with other staff members there. I found out that I was making way more than most of the people who have already been there. I wasn't even done with college at the time, and a lot of the other teachers were graduates who had several years more experience than me. I was hired with a few other people who were also making more than most of the staff who had been there. Understandably, people were furious and confronted management about it. They sent the first email.

Since they foolishly decided to put in an email that they were violating federal law, a bunch of us decided to see what the state department of labor would say. Luckily, New Jersey doesn't play around when it comes to workers rights. We screenshotted the email and sent it over to the DOL. About a month later, a nicely dressed man with a briefcase came in and sat in the office with the admins for about an hour. It looked heated in there. After he left, we were sent the second email. 

I love their attempt at gaslighting. ""Misconstrued???"" The subject of their first email about the matter was literally ""Grounds of Termination."" They straight up wrote that they may terminate anyone who discusses pay. They admitted to violating federal law by trying to ban us from discussing pay and by threatening to commit an act of workplace retaliation by firing people who discuss pay. There was absolutely nothing ""misconstrued."" They made themselves very clear. They were just embarrassed that we knew our rights, advocated for ourselves, and they got in trouble.

Honestly, this was just one of a ton of problems I had with this place. They acted like they couldn't afford to pay us more and hire more staff, but they could afford luxury cars, designer clothes, shoes, and accessories, expensive perfume and makeup, trips to a luxury hair and nail salon every week, lavish vacations, private school for their 2 kids, a mini mansion in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the state (that was even once featured in a local magazine), and apparently, an entirely new franchise. 

Yes, they were planning on opening a 3rd franchise. The kids were eating snacks out of flimsy coffee filters because they were cheaper than plates. They had the classrooms at max ratio and refused to give us any help because we were ""in ratio,"" despite the fact that we were all so stressed and had kids with different needs that we couldn't possibly manage without extra help. They only gave each classrom $25/month reimbursement budget. They would lose their minds if we came a minute early or stayed a minute past the end of our shift because they didn't want to pay overtime. Not a single member of the staff made anywhere close to a living wage, especially in an expensive state like NJ. Parents paid A LOT of money to send their kids there and it's considered one of the nicer preschools/daycares in the area. They had new enrollments almost weekly. They could afford an entirely new franchise with a new building, toys/furniture, staff, and  everything else that is essential to properly run a preschool, but ""couldn't afford"" to improve conditions for the staff and the kids at their existing schools? 

They generally treated us like shit. They spoke to us horribly. They had crazy high expectations. We had an app with daily reports for each kid that we had to fill out with A LOT of detail each day. We had to record every single thing we did, the kids' lunches and how much they ate of each food item (vast majority of the kids brought lunch from home, so you can imagine how difficult this was with the amount of kids we had), personal notes about each kid, and 3 pictures per day/per kid. We had 20 kids in my classroom who were 2.5-3 years old with just 2 of us. The ratio in my state for that age group is 1:10, but it's still A LOT of kids. We were expected to do all that in the app, but also supervise, lead lessons and activities, make sure the room looked ""tour-ready"" at all times, and find time to lesson plan when they wouldn't give us floaters to help supervise the kids while we planned and prepped activities. We also weren't allowed on our phones because it's distracting and takes away from supervision and interaction with the kids, but apparently those ipads with bigger screens don't do the same thing, especially with all the BS they wanted us to do on them.

The pictures thing was extremely frustrating. Like I said, we had to send 3 per kid per day. They had to be of them doing educational activities and had to be solo pics. Couldn't take a picture of a group of kids playing in the sensory bin for example. Had to take one of each individual kid doing it. They had to have captions. Once again, we had 20. Fucking. Kids. We had to send 60 pics a day and do all that or they would bitch at us and so would parents. They were so ridiculous about that. I had a parent drop off his kid super late one day. We hadn't even finished taking off his jacket or putting his stuff down and we're immediately getting harassed by phone over sending pics of him. One day, I was in the baby room. There were 10 babies with 3 teachers (ratio is 1:4). All of us were dealing with stressful situations. One of the owners comes storming in. Not to help us or check on us, but to yell at us for not sending pics. She's doing this as I'm feeding 2 babies at the same time, one of my coworkers was cleaning up the aftermath of a blowout, and my other coworker is trying to rock 2 screaming babies to sleep. She didn't acknowledge how overwhelmed we were, just got pissed that we hadn't sent pics. She yells at us and storms out. After my one colleague finished cleaning the blowout mess, she frantically tried to take pics. The owner came back shortly after and scolded us over the pics not being ""good enough."" It was at this point that I started looking for another job. I was so fed up with their shit and knew I had to get out of there. 

After some other BS, I quit with no notice. I still keep up with some former colleagues  and I hear that the turnover rate is still super high, but nothing has changed in the way they run things. No surprise there. I'm glad I escaped that place. Glad I was able to make them face consequences for something before I left.

They portray happy, wholesome, family-friendly environments on social media and use marketing gimmicks to make people think they are running premium preschools. But everything inside those buildings was a massive joke. The teachers and kids deserve so much better.

They acted like they couldn't afford to pay us more and hire more staff, but they could afford luxury cars, designer clothes, shoes, and accessories, expensive perfume and makeup, trips to a luxury hair and nail salon every week, lavish vacations, private school for their 2 kids, a mini mansion in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the state (that was even once featured in a local magazine), and apparently, an entirely new franchise. 

Yes, they were planning on opening a 3rd franchise. The kids were eating snacks out of flimsy coffee filters because they were cheaper than plates. They had the classrooms at max ratio and refused to give us any help because we were ""in ratio,"" despite the fact that we were all so stressed and had kids with different needs that we couldn't possibly manage without extra help. They only gave each classrom $25/month reimbursement budget. They would lose their minds if we came a minute early or stayed a minute past the end of our shift because they didn't want to pay overtime. Not a single member of the staff made anywhere close to a living wage, especially in an expensive state like NJ. Parents paid A LOT of money to send their kids there and it's considered one of the nicer preschools/daycares in the area. They had new enrollments almost weekly. They could afford an entirely new franchise with a new building, toys/furniture, staff, and  everything else that is essential to properly run a preschool, but ""couldn't afford"" to improve conditions for the staff and the kids at their existing schools? 

They generally treated us like shit. They spoke to us horribly. They had crazy high expectations. We had an app with daily reports for each kid that we had to fill out with A LOT of detail each day. We had to record every single thing we did, the kids' lunches and how much they ate of each food item (vast majority of the kids brought lunch from home, so you can imagine how difficult this was with the amount of kids we had), personal notes about each kid, and 3 pictures per day/per kid. We had 20 kids in my classroom who were 2.5-3 years old with just 2 of us. The ratio in my state for that age group is 1:10, but it's still A LOT of kids. We were expected to do all that in the app, but also supervise, lead lessons and activities, make sure the room looked ""tour-ready"" at all times, and find time to lesson plan when they wouldn't give us floaters to help supervise the kids while we planned and prepped activities. We also weren't allowed on our phones because it's distracting and takes away from supervision and interaction with the kids, but apparently those ipads with bigger screens don't do the same thing, especially with all the BS they wanted us to do on them.

The pictures thing was extremely frustrating. Like I said, we had to send 3 per kid per day. They had to be of them doing educational activities and had to be solo pics. Couldn't take a picture of a group of kids playing in the sensory bin for example. Had to take one of each individual kid doing it. They had to have captions. Once again, we had 20. Fucking. Kids. We had to send 60 pics a day and do all that or they would bitch at us and so would parents. They were so ridiculous about that. I had a parent drop off his kid super late one day. We hadn't even finished taking off his jacket or putting his stuff down and we're immediately getting harassed by phone over sending pics of him. One day, I was in the baby room. There were 10 babies with 3 teachers (ratio is 1:4). All of us were dealing with stressful situations. One of the owners comes storming in. Not to help us or check on us, but to yell at us for not sending pics. She's doing this as I'm feeding 2 babies at the same time, one of my coworkers was cleaning up the aftermath of a blowout, and my other coworker is trying to rock 2 screaming babies to sleep. She didn't acknowledge how overwhelmed we were, just got pissed that we hadn't sent pics. She yells at us and storms out. After my one colleague finished cleaning the blowout mess, she frantically tried to take pics. The owner came back shortly after and scolded us over the pics not being ""good enough."" It was at this point that I started looking for another job. I was so fed up with their shit and knew I had to get out of there. 

After some other BS, I quit with no notice. I still keep up with some former colleagues  and I hear that the turnover rate is still super high, but nothing has changed in the way they run things. No surprise there. I'm glad I escaped that place. Glad I was able to make them face consequences for something before I left.

They portray happy, wholesome, family-friendly environments on social media and use marketing gimmicks to make people think they are running premium preschools. But everything inside those buildings was a massive joke. The teachers and kids deserve so much better.

1in5xr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChiefMarketingOfficer/comments/1in5xr4/what_makes_a_great_fractional_cmo/,What makes a great fractional CMO?,"Maybe it's just me, but the first time I heard that someone was a fractional CMO all I could think about was? Okay, that sounds expensive!

I can only imagine there are many others like me (please don’t leave me alone in this one), so I just wanted to come in here to explain what this fancy-sounding title is about. Spoiler: it’s quite the opposite of expensive.

CMOs aren’t beginners—they’re seasoned marketing leaders with years of experience driving strategy and results. They bring a wealth of expertise to the table, and that level of insight comes with a hefty pay check.

This is where the fractional part comes in.

Fractional literally just means “part of a whole.” A fractional CMO is someone who does all the work of a CMO, but they do it part-time or on a contract basis. So instead of hiring a full-time CMO—which can cost upwards of $200,000 a year—you get access to that same expertise for a fraction of the time and a fraction of the cost. Pretty cool, right?

Now, what makes a great fractional CMO? Well, here’s where it gets interesting. 

**A CMO is not just a fancy marketing manager**

A CMO isn’t there to write Instagram captions, tweak ad copy, or jump into every little marketing task. If they are… well, you might have hired the wrong person. Instead, a great CMO looks at your whole business and figures out how marketing should actually work to bring in more customers.

They ask big, important questions like:

* What should people think when they hear our brand name?
* Who are our best customers, and how do we find more of them?
* What marketing efforts are actually worth our time and money?
* What are we doing just because everyone else is doing it? (Looking at you, random TikTok trends.)

A good CMO isn’t just someone who’s “been in marketing for a while.” They’ve been in the trenches. They’ve tested strategies, seen what works, and (probably) made a few expensive mistakes along the way—so you don’t have to. And if they’re really good, they’ll tell you straight up when an idea is bad instead of letting you waste money on it (just try not to take it personally).

**A good CMO brings order to the chaos**

Imagine you’re running a pretty new growing e-commerce store. Sales are picking up here and there, but your marketing? A total mess just like your inbox. You know you need to do something, but you have no idea what. So you drink your fifth coffee of the day and stare at your screen, hoping for divine inspiration.

This is exactly where a great CMO comes in. They don’t just throw out random suggestions like “Let’s do more YouTube ads!” Instead, they look at everything—your website, your branding, your sales funnel—and put together a strategy that actually makes sense (at least to them…it might take the rest of us some time to catch up).

That might mean:

* Fixing your website so people actually buy instead of just browsing and leaving
* Setting up an email funnel that keeps customers coming back
* Rethinking your messaging so people instantly get what makes you different
* Cutting out the marketing efforts that are draining your budget with little return

Basically, they take all your messy marketing ideas, turn them into a clear plan, and suddenly, things start making sense. No more guessing. No more panic-Googling “how to grow a business.” Just a roadmap that works.

**They bring fresh ideas from other businesses**

One of the best things about a great fractional CMO? They don’t just rely on what worked at their last job. They’ve worked with all kinds of businesses and have seen which strategies work for which companies.  

This means they bring in ideas you might not have even thought about—maybe something another industry is doing that could work perfectly for you. They know what’s trending, what’s outdated, and what’s just a waste of money.

They’re also great at making things work with small teams. If you don’t have a giant marketing department, a good CMO won’t just say, “You need to hire 10 more people.” Instead, they’ll figure out how to maximize what you already have: it doesn’t matter if that means training your current team or leaving a platform that is just not working (even if you are convinced you only need one more dancing challenge to go viral)

So… do you need a CMO?

If your marketing is at that “we’re just throwing things at the wall and hoping something sticks” stage, it might be time to bring someone with strong opinions to roast what you are doing. 

A great fractional CMO can help you stop guessing and start focusing on strategic growth without the expense of bringing on a full-time CMO.

And honestly? Having someone who knows what they’re doing is a huge relief.

So… have you ever been hired as a fractional CMO?

Stepping into a company as a fractional CMO requires more than just marketing expertise—it’s about quickly assessing challenges, aligning teams, and delivering results without the runway of a full-time role. The best fractional CMOs bring clarity, confidence, and a strategic mindset that makes an immediate impact.

What qualities do you think are essential for success in a fractional CMO role?",1,1739299502.0,ChiefMarketingOfficer,0,1.0,False
1in5xgg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1in5xgg,"Oscar’s Drive-In menu, San Diego, California, 1960s (opened by Jack in the Box’s founder)","From Vintage Menu Art dot com:

Famous for its massive malts and double-deck hamburgers, there were six Oscar’s drive-in coffee shops in San Diego where carhops - servers on roller skates - would bring food to your car.

Black and white photographs on the internet show the Oscar’s at El Cajon Blvd with candy striped awnings and - we’ve no idea why - a parade of elephants embossed on the entrance wall. Apparently, locals nicknamed it the ‘circus,’ due to the animal posters inside and out.

Robert O Peterson was a founder of the Oscars hamburger chain and later went on to create the Jack in the Box restaurant chain.

A native San Diegan, former traveling salesman and WWII intelligence officer, he founded Topsy’s drive-in in 1941 and it later became Oscar’s. In 1951, Peterson opened his first Jack in the Box and is credited with being the first to pair a drive-through with an intercom system. The speaker to take orders was hidden inside a plastic clown.

By 1967, with 300 Jack in the Boxes, Peterson sold the chain to the American conglomerate Ralston Purina, which later merged with Nestlé.

We’ve also found information about Oscar Soledad, a former chief of police of the town of Santa Cruz, who has been credited by some as being another founder of Oscar’s, along with his partner Stephen Ashley.

Ashley’s father Jack was also a fast-food pioneer, opening the first drive-through bakery on Point Loma in 1909, correctly guessing that people in automobiles wouldn’t want to get out of their cars and walk just to pick up bread.

There were six Oscar’s in San Diego at 12th and C streets, Midway and Rosecrans, Pacific and Rosecrans, Euclid and El Cajon, Mission Blvd and Garnet, Pacific Beach, and 16th and National, National City.

We believe this menu is from the late 1950s or early 60s when a double-deck hamburger cost 44c and the famous extra-rich, extra-thick malts and milkshakes topped with whipped cream cost 25c.",40,1739299481.0,VintageMenus,3,1.0,False

Please help me out,"This might be a long one. But I really need some spiritual guidance and advice and other peoples perspective on this. But I'll keep it short and sweet and to the point. 

Back in 2017 I moved into my first new bachelor apartment and I had issues with my neighbor downstairs. I ended up calling the cops on him one night cause he inappropriately touched me. So the cop came he was very charming and good looking he was exactly my type. Long story short he arrests the guy and the guy was put in jail. I wanted to give him a rose than I had but he couldn't accept my gifts.  Later on months go by and I got into some activity that I shouldn't have. I won't get into it but I ended up getting a text message from a number and they said they couldn't tell me who it was that I had to figure it out. But they were upset with what I was doing. But they told me I had met him not too long ago and thought he was very hot so I figured out it was the cop messaging me and I asked specific questions to see if it was him that no one else would know and he answered them. So I'm thinking it was him and we are talking. Long story short he was telling me he's schizophrenic has hepatitis b and other stuff that I won't mention. I was trying to him help him that night we spoke if it was him. Than he said he was going to destroy everything I ever owned but the next day apologized and said he was drunk. So I left it alone. Months go by and I move into my new apartment. This is where it gets creepy. I saw him in my building parking lot and he had a very evil smile on him but didn't look human. Than my landlord came up to me and said a cop came into my apartment and was searching through all my stuff crying on my couch saying he's very worried about me and I go into my apartment and yes everything was tossed around. I also forgot to mention before I moved into my new place I had arguments with my previous landlord and called the cop station. The cop I met answered the phone. Than we spoke a bit and he suddenly three ways my old social worker on the phone and we are having a three way and I'm like how do you guys even know eachother ? But I do remember telling him that I was in love with my social worker and I only give the cop his name not where he lived. And the cop was telling him things about me. And I was embarrassed on the phone. And the cop asked me. Are you going to tell anyone what I spoke to you about ? And I said no. But accidentally told the social worker on the other line that he has schizophrenia and the cop was like do you find it funny ? What if it happened to you ? 

Well after I move into my new place I'm getting stalked by the cop. Months go by as I'm living there and strange things were happening. Someone trying to open my door in the middle of the night. Anyway. I'm trying to get on medication for my anxiety. They ended up putting me on lyrica and I ended up having a psychosis. I ran out of my apartment thinking people were coming in there to kill me. I went into the homeless shelter and woke up to a demonic voice that took a form of my sister and I heard her voice and me and my sister are not on good terms. I seen a big full moon. Than someone in my room with the lights off was laughing very evil and hysterically and suddenly took a form of a man and was waving it me it was very creepy. Than I saw black eyes on someone and someone eyes were rolling at the back of their head and it didn't seem human. Than I also saw someone with red eyes speaking in a demonic voice to me. Also someone took a form of my sister telling me how strong I am. I saw alot more stuff too but trying to get to the point. During my psychosis I had an image of my sister talking to me telling me I'm going through a psychosis but in a very annoying voice but that's how I figured I was going through a psychosis my first time going through all of this and that's where it ended and I went to the hospital. I was going through a psychosis for three months straight and lost everything. 



Afterwards I move into my dad's house and covid  began. Stayed at my dad's for three years. Stopped taking my pills cause I figured nothing was wrong with me. Than in 2022 a friend of mine passed away it was really sad and I was really depressed. So one day I was not doing good and called the cops on myself cause I was really depressed about his death wishing god would take my life instead of his. Than one day I ended up hearing my friend who passed away, his voice in my ear. And it happened twice. than at night time it was very late at night I asked God to show me a sign if he's real. Than the church bells rang at close to 12 am at night. And the church bells never ring at that time usually on Sunday during the day. Than I went outside looked at the moon and said "" do you find it funny what I'm going through "" and the moon suddenly disappeared. So I figured they didn't find it funny. But my hallucinations started again and this is where I thought I was god. Long story short I started hallucinating, one night I even felt like I should poke my eye out. But the next day I was begging for help and the sun appeared next to me really big and bright and I felt like I was healed. Than I figured I was going through another psychosis so I went to the hospital. It was a very eerie feeling too. And I saw people with black eyes that looked demonic. The psychiatrist that came to see me said in her exact words "" we were good business partners at one point "" I don't even know who she is. I just saw alot of crazy stuff than moved out of my dad's and lived somewhere else and got help. Forgot to mention when I was at the hospital I seen the cop again and it looked like him but in a different form and he just kept staring at me with black eyes. Than I had an image in my head that I was talking to myself and I said "" she's tricking you "" than later on I was sleeping and heard a man's voice saying "" I just like to scare her "" 


Later on I move into a new place.  Than months go by and I ended up moving and becoming homeless again. Forgot to take my meds too. So went through another psychosis. And one night I was really upset and I was sitting infront of a coffee shop when there was no one there and it was closed. I was yelling at karma at the time really upset and I was also facing a hotel where the windows were facing me. And once I was yelling at karma I saw three tall black figures at the hotel windows facing me and they were all men waving at me very scary and for a good few minutes. Wasn't like a human. 


I just wanna know is something out there trying to ruin my life ? Or give me a sign ? The first time it happened I wasn't in a good state and planning on moving anyway. This only happens when I plan to leave. And I have asked whatever out there to give me a sign. The last time it happened to me I did ask for a sign that this is all real.

I was ashamed,"This is what Helena says after she and Mark “baby goated”. This was unprompted. Mark didn’t ask. She volunteered it, and of course validated her night gardener story was a lie. 

Many of us suspected it was Helena on the severed floor. First and foremost, Lumon would be absolutely crazy to send Helly R. back down there. Then there were things that didn’t seem quite right about her behavior. I think too many things in general were chosen as people confirmed their suspicions (“Helly R wouldn’t drink her coffee that way”), but there were serious signs.

However, Helena was there to make sure Mark worked on Cold Harbor, and she didn’t seem to do that. When Irv was tense about going to O&D, she still encouraged him to go. Was this part of a pernicious Lumon plot? I don’t think so, Lumon isn’t that good at pernicious plots. What it did was reveal to Irv about the Export Hall. 

Then there was the trip to Mammalians Nutruable. Helena was the one who noticed the pathway. She didn’t discourage Mark from going. Again, was this part of the pernicious Lumon plot? For Mark to discover a new department and spread his concerns about Ms. Casey?

And was Helena trying to damage Mark’s connection to Mammalians Nutruable when she grabbed the picture of Ms. Casey and showed it around? I don’t know, the Mammalians were on the verge of kicking them out anyway. 

And there’s this conversation between Helena and Mark:

> Helly: ***That was mean of me… to say that to Irving.***
> 
> Mark: I mean, he kind of deserved it. And I can make goo-goo eyes at anyone I want. Are you okay?
> 
> Helly: ***Sorry if I'm distracting you from…***
> 
> Mark: From what?
> 
> Helly: From looking for your wife.
> 
> Mark: Hey, it's okay. I know we'll find her, ***and you've already helped so much.***
> 
> Helly: ***I have?***

Did Helena mean it. Did Mark mean it or was he just anxious to get his baby goat on. (And yes, I’m going to continue using this phrase.)

And finally there’s Helena’s giggling at Milchick proclaiming every word in Appendix IV is true. After the story of Dieter melting after he spilt his heritage upon the soil. Was this on purpose? Was this to get Mark on her side? Was this planned? Or did Helena actually find it ridiculous, and the fact the other innies took it so seriously?

I have no doubt that was Helena on the severed floor, but I wonder while she was down there, did some of Helly leaked through.

Many people insist that Helly and Helena are two separate people. I’ve even seen posts claiming Helena went down there, so she could get impregnated by Mark and not Helly as if it was possible for only one to get impregnated. Helena didn’t have to do that to get pregnant. She could have sent Mark S and Helly R down to the severed floor in an area that looked like a cheap motel room to get that result.

There is something called Stockholm Syndrome where a hostage starts identifying with their captors. Did Helena, working with the innies and especially Mark started identifying with the innies?

There’s an aspect of Helly R. that Helena Eagan sees and wants. Helly is liked and not feared. Helly has love. Helly is free and uninhabited. She hasn’t refined her four tempers down to the point where she’s an empty shell only interested in power.

I wonder if Helena got at least partly “reintegrated” with her time on the severed floor and with Mark. (And yes, I’m talking metaphorically. I don’t think she took a trip to see Reghabi.). Did Helly R. leak through into Helena. ",1,1739299351.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,1,1.0,False

If I finish a breakfast or lunch for example and I enjoyed the taste of it my brain often automatically starts thinking, that was so enjoyable, it would be so fun to eat unlimited amounts of it or something as nice. My brain convinces me that unless I eat as much more as I can fit, without restraints or limits, I will feel sad and desolate.
If I skip breakfast and lunch and just have dinner right before I sleep, the food noise is minimal because I shut it off when I go to bed and I don’t feel like a failure for needing to eat more often, because I’m not eating more often. Often when I’ve had a day meal like lunch my brain starts going well now you’ve ruined the day because you have to minimise the size of your dinner so to be still on track with weight goals, and it starts feelings of deprivation because I feel secure safe and more motivated during the day knowing I have a bigger dinner to look forward too.

There’s probably more thoughts/ theories I’ve had about why one meal a day works for me but they are not coming to the forefront my head right now.

I had spent nearly a month mostly not eating during the day and not binging, then I decide to do it, and the moment I do it I feel the most triggered I’ve felt in all that time, and cave to a binge

Please note so as to not be deceptive: I do always have milk in my morning coffee’s, and I will have sugar free sweeteners like stevia during the day and sometimes I would have wine too. But for some reason the drinks don’t trigger me as much as long as they aren’t heavy like beer, milkshakes, etc",3,1739299239.0,BingeEatingDisorder,6,0.71,False

So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married, have a fantastic job, travel a lot, and living a life most would be envious of. I guess it depends on what makes you envious. I don’t brag but I’ve been told it’s desirable, but it mostly just tears me apart.

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don’t have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I look forward to talking to.

1in5r6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/1in5r6u/sians_choices_are_disappointing/,Sian's choices are disappointing.,"I might be attacked for this, but I can't be the only person who found Sian's behaviour a little questionable?

Let me point out what I mean by that. I'm not that good with words, but I will try to explain it as respectfully as possible.

- When Sian picked JeongSu for paradise date I had no expectations towards this couple. As the viewer I had already seen Sian's date with JunSeo and while this pair is nowhere near my favourite, I came to conclusion and accepted that they're endgame.
However JeongSu didn't see their date. He only caught a glimpse at their dynamics during the double date (when there was clearly some tension between the two) and during helicopter ride where he caught a sight of Sian leaning on Yuk shoulder. You could see how baffled by this gesture he was. So clearly he had no idea things are serious between them. The reason for that is that Sian never actually told him. She would ignore his existence all together until JeongSu started pulling away from her (date with HaeLin and YouJin). That's when Sian would start giving him hope again. First after his date with HaeLin - she picked him for the coffee date. Second time after his date with YouJin - she picked him as her paradise date.

I know there are many Sian fans out there, but bias aside, doesn't that look like she was constantly giving him hope? Everytime his attention would shift to someone else, Sian would suddenly start expressing interest in the guy again. It almost felt like he wasn't her first choice, but she wanted her to be his. Which isn't fair.

Then their second paradise date happened. Sian had many opportunities to come clean to JeongSu. He actually gave her one by asking about her leaning on JunSeo's shoulder before. She could at that moment confess about sharing bed with JunSeo. It could be only fair for JeongSu to know that, especially knowing how much that leaning on the shoulder thing alone bothered him. Instead she chose not to confess anything and even brushed his concerns away by saying she's merely confused. I mean- at this point she already knew that she's all in with JunSeo so why not just come clean to JeongSu and give him closure he clearly needs? I'm sorry, but it felt like she wanted to lead him on until the end so she ends up with a few guys at the end of the show instead of just one (JunSeo). Why could she be open and honest with Theo, but not JeongSu? It's only a guess, but I felt like she needed at least one more back up plan in case JunSeo changes his mind last minute. Or I could be wrong, but it really looks like Sian used him as a backup plan AND as a placeholder until JunSeo comes to his senses - like showing him that she has other options than JunSeo. Which is really unfair to JeongSu. 

I don't really know what else to say. Sian wasn't my favourite since the beginning, but I never straight out hated the girl. I was sometimes annoyed by her questionable decisions, but I kept telling myself that they're all just human and making mistakes is normal. However this... this felt so manipulative and rude towards JeongSu who genuinely liked her. He gave her everything she expected from him - he ended things with the other girls, gave her the reassurement she needed and once she had all that, she turned her back on him and went with JunSeo instead. It's like she doesn't want the guy who gives it his all, but the one who doesn't give a damn and who she has to chase. In that case, good for her, she found him. But she could've done things differently and act less selfishly. ",13,1739299058.0,Singlesinferno2,33,0.62,False

I have a burr grinder, but I can't taste the difference when I get whole beans, so I don't want to take the time anymore. But almost every recommended local roaster seems to sell only whole beans.

And I notice a lot of roasters seem to turn their noses up at dark roasts. I've had other dark-roast coffee that was, in fact, bitter; I don't want that bitterness, nor the sourness that pervades 3rd wave medium roasts (or ""brightness"" if you like the flavor).

# 🏙️ [The Apartment]

Right next to **Win Son Bakery, great bars, and awesome restaurants** (Ichiran and Roberta’s are just a quick walk into Bushwick)! We have a **grocery store/bodega** kitty-corner from us with fantastic fresh produce, great food, and solid coffee. We’re also just a few stops from **Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, and the Williamsburg waterfront**.

* **Third-floor walk-up** (not that bad and worth it for the lighting) ☀️
* **4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms**
   * **One small single-person bathroom** 🚿
   * **One full-sized bathroom to be shared by the new roommate + two others 🛁**

* **Rooftop access** with views of the lower Manhattan skyline 🌇
* **Virtual doorman & in-building gym** 🏋️‍♂️
* **Great natural light & skylights** 🌞

# 🔍 [What We’re Looking For: Non-Negotiables]

* Someone **friendly, communicative, and queer-friendly.**
* Respects shared spaces & **cleans up after themselves** (we have a simple cleaning rotation for the kitchen/living room, but also clean up after ourselves whenever we use the kitchen) 🧽
* **No pets, no smoking in the apartment** 🚭
* **Someone who doesn’t bring the party home with them** \- we all love a good time, but we keep it quiet and peaceful at home.
* No oversized furniture—**just the essentials!** Our kitchen/living room space is already furnished so there is only room for what will fit in yours.

# 🛏️ [The Room]

* **Windows** with good light 🌿
* **$1,260.30/month + utilities (WiFi/electricity)**
* **Security deposit = first month’s rent**
* **Move-in:** Anytime between **mid-March and the first week of April**
   * If you move in during March, you’ll pay the exiting tenant. Starting in April, you’ll be on the lease.

If this sounds like a good fit, **reach out**! We’d love to set up a tour and chat with the roommates.",1,1739298689.0,williamsburg,0,1.0,False

I’m autistic and have awfulll attachment issues and really struggled getting myself out a depressive episode after he broke up with me even though i saw it coming from the last month of our relationship (he wants to move abroad after he graduates and because of my degree i can’t move away and he didn’t think long distance would work)


I was at my local library today and he texted me saying “don’t freak out but i’m sat behind you” and after saying literally two days ago he didn’t think he was ready to see me asked to go for coffee. During this coffee he admitted he’s been fucking a girl on his course and despite me doing the exact same thing (hypocrite i know) i’m so angry and slightly sad. I know we’re broken up and i’m literally starting to move on a little bit and seeing this guy has really helped me (he knows all about my ex bless him) but how have people gotten over the jealousy left over from relationships? i just can’t seem to sever those final attachments and the idea of another girl touching him makes me feel nauseous lol and i’m sick and tired of a little bit of me wanting him even though i know we are not getting back together!

""Dating is a number's game. If you meet enough people, eventually it will work with someone.""

Look. I was on about 9 different dating apps (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Coffee Meets Bagel, Badoo, Boo Dating, and Facebook Dating) for 12 years. I went to Meetup and Eventbrite events every afternoon for like 6 years. I was in my city's running club and before that my university's running club. I was making $150,000 a year as a software engineer for Amazon and going to the gym 3 afternoons a week. I have probably met (or at least introduced myself to) over 10,000 women in my life. All that, and I have NEVER had a girlfriend despite wanting one, and I'm 31 now (Note: a one-night-stand with a woman from a dating app is NOT a girlfriend). Also, my standards are rock bottom, like I have gone on dates with and slept with morbidly obese women, psychiatrically ill women, women with a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), women who I found less sexually attractive or not sexually attractive, etc. Lowering my standards didn't fix the issue.

And I'm not the only guy who struggles. I know of a guy who is a 46 year old virgin despite trying. There are whole communities of guys who can't get a girlfriend or can't get laid despite wanting to and trying. I'm not going to name the communities because I don't want some sort of auto-mod to flag this post, but you know what I'm talking about.

If dating is a probability game, then there are some people for whom their probability is zero. It doesn't matter what they do. They can spend $50,000 on dating coaches. They can have the best therapist and psychiatrist. They can get plastic/cosmetic surgery or do bodybuilding. They can read all the pickup artist and self-help books. They can go on literally hundreds of dates. It doesn't matter. Stop saying it's a number's game. For some people, it's not.

**Edit 1:** If some people say or think ""But it is a number's game"", that's proof that this is truly an unpopular opinion.

**Edit 2:** This is my best theory to explain why I can't get a girlfriend. A boyfriend and girlfriend relationship is a type of friendship. I have had lots of temporary transient acquaintances in my life, like due to us having a shared activity or group on meetup.com that we both enjoyed, but I've never REALLY had a caring, lasting, two-way, close, long-term friendship. I have a psychiatrist and a therapist and my therapist thinks I am some sort of neurodivergent, but I was tested for autism as a kid and didn't have it. I don't know, I think it's some sort of brain/personality/psychiatric thing that isn't fixable by therapy or meds. I mean I'm no male model, but I think it's more of a brain/personality/psychiatric thing than a looks thing or a height thing or anything superficial like that.",9,1739298581.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,10,0.84,False

I’m being kind to myself, going slow, leaning into rest and recovery where I can.

Savoring my morning cup of coffee

Nytimes word puzzles—currently obsessed with Spelling Bee

Dumb TV—currently binging Real Housewives of Salt Lake City

Journaling—short entries on my thoughts and mood, but also keeping a log of all the bad stuff with my Q so I don’t go back—plus scrolling up to old texts that were messed up

This Al-anon Reddit—getting sage advice from those who have come before me + trying to help those who still feel stuck

Leaning into solitude—but making sure I see another human about every 3 days so things don’t get too dark—really leaning on friends

Cooking for just ME 

Having a glass of wine—just one, but really enjoying it without any worry around it

Working out for endorphins/sweat

Long walks in the city, nature, you name it

Finding the sunset whenever I can

Dog cuddles

Music allll the time—matching my mood—if I need to wallow, sad song, if I need to get motivated, loud upbeat tunes

Dreaming of a future that’s calm, consistent, and maybe eventually full of butterflies, flirting, love (and even some passion!)

I have been doing my best to provide her with a safe and loving environment in my home however she wants out.  Let me set the stage

I moved her out of her apartment about 6 months ago into my home.  This was prompted by her being alone 90% of the time.  I lived an hour away, so it was hard to see her or help her very often.  She had a couple falls and couldn't walk on several occasions, she wasn't taking her medication, she would watch tv all day long and she wouldn't eat much at all and most of her food would expire and she wouldn't get rid of it. On top of that, she would call me frantic that people were breaking into her house and stealing her things or moving them around.  She wasn't to fond of the apartment and was constantly wanting to move due to it being on the second floor.

I move her out of the apartment and asked her to stay with me so that we could care for her but in reality, she thought she would find another apt ASAP.  She is fond of her stuff (furniture etc) and is constantly asking about it and she goes and looks through it at the storage we have it kept at.  In my home she has her own room with bathroom, furnished with her belongings, I give her meds and vitamins, feed her, and we go to the gym, she comes with me to any and all kids sporting events and practices and we usually spend the evening coloring, playing cards, talking or drinking some beers.  Not her favorite but she does workbooks and some puzzles that I got for her.  My wife and I both work from home so she is always supervised.  She will stay with my sister or other family members when I am out of town.  When we are working for the most part she will stay in her room rearranging her closet, tries to use her sewing machine or trying to figure out how to use the computer (I have helped her several times)

However after the last neuro appointment, the doctor had recommended that she not live alone and should no longer be driving.  That prompted the end of her world for her.  She has accused my wife and I of stealing her car keys, taking her clothes and or moving them around, and drinking her coffee.  She has accused my kids of going into her room and hiding her stuff.  I think all for the end goal to find a way out.  She has enough funds to buy a small condo or rent and apartment but she is adamant she wants to be alone with her stuff and for us to not bother her anymore.   I have been working to get her into our county adult care program which is relatively free however I don't think she would even want to attend.

My goal is obviously to try to slow down the progression of the condition with the stimulation but I fear she is starting to resent me for ""trapping"" her.  I am at a cross roads in that do I just get her a place on her own knowing she will refuse any type of support, adult care, or nurse and let her be OR do I continue to keep her with me until I can no longer care for her??  She has had some outbursts that put a strain on everyone but I would say for the most part she can act ok.

I will take any and all input, advice etc

For years, I’ve been building SaaS products—late nights, endless cups of coffee, and that relentless drive to create something valuable. But every single time I launched, I hit the same frustrating wall: marketing.

I knew my products were useful. I believed in them. But getting people to notice? That felt impossible. I’d spend hours crafting Twitter posts, searching for relevant content, trying to engage with people—only to get crickets in response. It was exhausting and disheartening.

After my latest product launch flopped—not because it wasn’t good, but because nobody even knew it existed—I had a moment of clarity. If I was struggling with marketing this much, other founders must be feeling the same pain. The problem wasn’t my ideas—it was getting them in front of the right people consistently.

So, I decided to fix my own problem.

I built **YourPostPal**—a tool that automates Twitter posting by collecting relevant data, generating engaging posts, and scheduling them for you. No more staring at a blank screen wondering what to write. No more spending hours on social media instead of actually building. YourPostPal helps founders like me (and you) stay visible without the constant struggle.

I’m really excited about this, and if you’ve ever felt the same frustration, I’d love for you to check it out. **Sign up here:** [https://productwait.com/yourpostpal](https://productwait.com/yourpostpal). Let’s finally get our products the attention they deserve.

If you place an order, it sometimes takes up to **3 business days** just for the order to process. Not even ship. Just process so it can be shipped. Then **7 more business days** for the shipping process. Last time, it took **two weeks** from purchase for the beans to arrive at my door.

This strikes me as totally unreasonable. For a domestic product from a relatively large company (at least not a small store) to take this long. I can get products from China faster. Is this a Blue Bottle issue? Can you order beans faster elsewhere?",1,1739297781.0,espresso,4,0.67,False

Main dwelling has a lot of utilized full electric appliances (no gas) and so electrician recommended 75amps for ADU (since washer/dryer would be shared with the rest of the house). Would you say 75amps is enough for the following appliances at any given time in the ADU?

40 gal tank electric water heater
Electric range (stove + oven)
Over the range microwave
2x 8000- 12000 BTU window AC 
Refrigerator 
Air fryer
Keurig coffee maker

*note: there will not be a dishwasher or sink garbage disposal

If, in the future, we considered a fast Ev charger in the ADU, could we do so by installing a 90amp breaker (current feeder for ADU subpanel is #2 AL XHHW-2 wire so we have flexibility later).
