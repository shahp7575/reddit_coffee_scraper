I was only familiar with the opening track “Never Say Never,” but what a record!

1qt9cv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qt9cv5/how_to_not_go_back_to_toxic_relationship_while/,How to not go back to toxic relationship while pregnant?,"I’m 20 and currently 33 weeks pregnant. I’ve been with my boyfriend (22) for almost two years.

At the beginning of our relationship, we talked a lot about the future — kids, family, plans, how everything would be when we had a child. It felt like we were on the same page.

But when I actually got pregnant, everything changed.

This pregnancy has been very hard physically. I’ve been hospitalized multiple times and I’m often in pain and exhausted. Emotionally, I’ve felt very alone.

After I got pregnant, he became angry all the time. He yelled a lot, insulted me, and got upset over small things.

At home, everything was my responsibility — cooking, cleaning, laundry. If I didn’t do something or didn’t do it “right,” he would get angry and yell. He often said that since I stay at home, I should at least do all the housework because he works. Whenever I said I was in pain, he dismissed it and said I couldn’t be tired or hurting if I was “just at home.”

Even when I was in pain myself, I still took care of him — made tea, brought medicine, helped him when he didn’t feel well. That care was never returned.

Whenever I tried to talk about the baby, plans, or my fears, he either ignored me or answered with a few short words. I never felt like I could really talk to him. Sometimes he even got angry and said I was “overthinking” or worrying about nonsense. 

When I needed to go to the hospital to check on the baby, he complained and acted annoyed. One time I thought my water had broken. On the way to the hospital, he stopped for coffee and wanted me to go inside. I said I felt too unwell and stayed in the car. He yelled at me and said he wouldn’t even go to the hospital with me.

I went in alone. Doctors were briefly worried about the baby’s heartbeat and asked where the father was. I had to tell them he wasn’t there. That moment made me realize how lonely I’ve felt.

The breakup itself happened over something small. On our anniversary, I cooked and tried to do something nice. He demanded my vape. I said no. He immediately said we’re breaking up, packed his things, insulted me and my family, and left.  front of my grandmother, he yelled at me and called me names. Later she told me her biggest fear was that he would hit me. I couldnt tell her that he slapped me in the face. Another time he grabbed me by my sweater and screamed directly into my face. I didn’t fight back or insult him. When he said he wanted to break up, I said “okay” and stayed silent while he kept yelling.

 A few days later, he messaged me asking to borrow money.

I know logically that leaving is better for me and my child. Everyone around me tells me not to go back. But emotionally, it’s hard. I still love him and struggle not to text him or hope he’ll change.

I’m not looking for judgment.

1qt9c4w,https://v.redd.it/5ri0b47mxxgg1,Loves Dream,"He left that day beneath a sky of stone,
She stayed behind, a prayer all alone.
One last kiss on the platform's edge,
Then just the sound of the train's cold breath.
Out there, the nights smelled of smoke and dust,
He thought of her between the shots and rust.
On every letter, he wrote her name,
Like a promise he swore he'd never break.
Since that day, he never speaks her name,
Love's locked away in an old drawer frame.
He drinks his coffee black, no sugar, no cream,
And on his heart, he's drawn a cross on love's
dream.

He came back alive, but shoulders bent,
Walking toward the house where time had spent.
The door wide open, the table too wide,
And on the photo, her smile still inside.
They told him softly, with trembling voice,
That she had waited for him till the end of
choice.
She held his name in her final breath,
Even when the world had turned to death.               
Now he walks alone through empty streets,
Where her shadow used to meet his feet.
He doesn't cry, he doesn't call,
He just lets silence cover it all.
Love came once, but it left too soon,
Buried deep beneath a cold, white moon.
So he closes his eyes and turns away,
From the ghost of her smile at the end of the
day.

I'm not particularly familiar with CRPGs, but I knew that the world and the story would definitely appeal to me. 

The reason I waited so long was because I knew I needed to set aside time to get used to the mechanics and gameplay. And I admit that the first 5-10 hours were a bit tough, mainly because I didn't understand a lot of things, and I also understand that for some people, the idea of having to “struggle through” the first 5-10 hours sounds like a pretty bad idea, but it wasn't that bad, just a little confusing here and there. And once it clicked, I found it hard to stop. I don't presume to claim that I understand everything now, but I think I've found a good flow after almost 35 hours. And holy shit, I'm so addicted. I spent the whole day today (Sunday), really the whole DAY, playing. My daughter was out all day with her cousin and her uncle (my brother), and my wife wanted to rest all day after her night shift, alternating between sleeping and watching TV series. So I played, and oh boy, did I play. I clocked 12 hours today. I'm not kidding, 12 hours of almost non-stop gaming in one day as an adult. Only interrupted by occasional coffee and toilet breaks and an hour-long lunch break where I had something to eat with my wife. I already know that I'll be sitting at work like a man possessed for the next few days and can't wait to continue playing as soon as I get home. 

I don't know why I'm posting this, it won't interest anyone in this sub or offer any valuable information, but I just needed an outlet to share my enthusiasm for this game. 

In case anyone is interested, I'm still in Act 1 after about 35 hours and I think there's still a lot waiting for me. The goblin camp has been defeated and the grove has been liberated, and I've also done a few smaller side quests in the overworld. I'm currently in Underdark, more specifically in the Grymforge, but I think I'll be done there soon. I just defeated Nere and finally called it a day. However, there's probably a whole area waiting for me in the north where I'll encounter Lae'zel's squad.",4,1769976659.0,BaldursGate3,1,1.0,False

1qt98gc,https://www.reddit.com/r/GutHealth/comments/1qt98gc/worth_asking/,Worth Asking,"Hi, I have been reading posts about digestive issues and the low-FODMAP diet, etc, on reddit for months and finally decided to write my own post. I am a 36 yo woman, and I am at my wit's end. I'm sorry this is going to be long, but I want to tell the full story because it's baffling to me and perhaps all the information will help.

I originally posted this on the FODMAP subreddit, but it seems like maybe that wasn't the right place...

I read the Bloated Belly Whisperer, but I feel like I still don't have answers. I have a GI appmt scheduled. I have already worked with her to look into my LPR symptoms, which I had for about 7-8 years, but have gone away in the last 6 months. Because the LPR symptoms (constant coughing and throat irritation, clearing, etc, and gag reflex being triggered in the morning by coughing so severely I'd end up vomiting) were making me miserable, we never really got to talking about the other digestive issues that have plagued me my entire life. I mean, my coworkers called me ""Coughing C\_\_\_\_"" (my name begins with C), so it was pressing.

My GI had me on pantoprazole for quite a while, which didn't really help and I've since stopped taking it. I had an endoscopy that showed no signs of GERD damage, and an esophageal manometry test that proved my esophageal motility is normal. I did the Acid Watcher diet for a while, which also made no difference. In spite of the LPR, there is absolutely no proof that I ever suffered from excess stomach acid/GERD in the first place.

Now that the LPR symptoms have subsided, I have decided to figure out this bloating situation. As an infant/toddler, I struggled with constipation. I was prescribed kondremul, which I took for a large portion of my childhood. I would sit and strain and it was truly horrible.

As a teenager, I definitely had some dysfuntion regarding BMs. I couldn't go in the morning and then would hold it all day until I got home from school, when I could relax and find relief. After lunch, I would often have tummy aches and indigestion, and the nurse would give me a peppermint and send me back to class. I'd have to hold in farts all day. Slowly, my ability to go regularly and in the morning developed, and I rarely have had issues in that department since. I do tend to require coffee...I had a virus recently and was severely constipated the whole time. Jasmine green and peppermint tea didn't help. A week later, the first day I felt well enough to drink coffee, boom, relief. Like magic. And all this time, all my life, I essentially have NEVER had diarrhea.

My grandmother used to theorize that my digestive system was slow. I'm not sure why she would make that observation, when I wasn't even fully aware of the issue until I was in my late teens, but obviously something was always up. If I ate a large or rich meal, my heart would race and I'd feel intense pressure in my stomach, and I'd burp and burp, and I wouldn't be able to sleep until I'd vomited the majority of the meal back up. Then I could sleep. When I discovered Gas-X, it was life changing. It helped quite a bit, to the point where I would feel the pressure, but I'd be able to get enough gas released that I wouldn't necessarily have to vomit (provided I didn't wait too long after the meal to take it -- sometimes I wouldn't take it in time, and it would be a waste of a pill).

This bloating would cause noticeable distention. Often, my belly would be distended even if I didn't feel especially bloated (perhaps because I'm so used to the feeling, it only bothers me when it's really bad). This has prevented me from feeling comfortable in my skin for my entire adult life. It's why I never wear cute dresses, or even anything remotely fitted. It's why I start to get ready to go to a party or event and then get depressed looking at myself in the mirror and don't go.

It is not just fat, because it is hard and goes up and down regularly and noticeably (and even at my least distended, it is still somewhat inflated. It never truly goes away. I don't know what having a flat belly looks like). I'd like to note that I have never been truly overweight -- I have certainly been heavier, but still not what would be considered fat or even that chubby. I have recently lost quite a bit of weight (dropped from around 160, my heaviest ever, to currently around 125 lbs) and work out regularly. I am aiming for 120 at the moment. I have been a pescatarian for several years now (perhaps this has contributed to the resolution of my LPR symptoms?) and am honestly in the best shape of my life. Full disclosure, I have also tended to drink too much, though I have stopped drinking entirely for periods of time in the past couple years, which I can't say had a noticable impact on my digestive system, and I have cut back quite a bit overall.

With the weight loss, it is more apparent than ever. I can almost see my abs, but halfway between my ribcage and belly button, everything flares out and I look, as many people say, pregnant.

Since I've never had diarrhea or had to deal with racing to the bathroom, I'm certain I don't have IBS or Crohn's. Nonetheless, I decided to try the low-FODMAP diet. I have been keeping a thorough food journal since I started, and absolutely cannot determine a pattern. Suffice it to say, the low-FODMAP diet has made no difference. In fact, my bloating is just as bad if not worse (it was horrendous last night and is still extra bad as I write this and I haven't even eaten yet today). I thought if I had gastropareisis or SIBO or any of the other usual suspects that are mentioned, it would at least help a little. But the weird thing is that it would mean I've had whatever condition is causing my issues for essentially my entire life.

I was really hoping to have at least made a little progress or answered some questions before my GI appmt, but I haven't narrowed anything down yet at all. I am hoping she schedules some tests for me at least, and maybe even a gastric emptying study and/or colonoscopy (haven't had one before).

Before trying low-FODMAP, I ate healthy, and have done so for years now (lots of fruits and vegetables, very little sugar, a normal/moderate amount of fat and protein, hardly any red meat). I do not overeat. I drink SO MUCH water. I have tried lactose free, gluten free, sugar free -- all kinds of diets. Nothing seems to make a difference. I can eat the most correct meal, and still suffer. On occasion, I can eat an incorrect meal (fried foods, for example), and not suffer that much by comparison. I have made an effort to eat more slowly, and to chew my food more. I have never noticed a pattern with onions or garlic, for instance, both of which I have eaten in excess for my whole life. But I'm not eating either at all now, and, yes, I'm being very careful with seasonings/condiments/etc. I am being especially careful about fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides. And everything is still bad. What gives??? As I said, I've been a pescatarian for a few years. Now, because I can't eat most beans/legumes on the low-FODMAP diet, I have resorted to eating some lean turkey/chicken again in the meantime, in addition to fish/shellfish. After eating lean turkey yesterday, my bloating was horrible. After a dinner of steamed salmon, same thing. Is a problem digesting protein possibly involved? Gas-x helps relieve some of the pressure, but after multiple gas-xes and about a gallon of peppermint tea over the course of the day, relief was still minimal, and I was burping up until I decided to give up and just go to sleep.

When I read the Bloated Belly Whisperer, I stopped taking the digestive enzymes with probiotics in them, worried that the probiotics were adding to the problem. Now, I am not taking any pre or probiotics or digestive enzymes (and to be honest, when I was...they didn't seem to help either). I can't tell if the problem is worse now than ever, or if it's just that I'm extra focused on it.

It wasn't until a couple of days ago that I read about the possibility of it being low stomach acid. I have ordered bitters but they won't arrive for like 5 more days. I need to go buy Bragg's ACV and give that a try. I love vinegar and have always seemed to crave it my whole life. In fact, acidic foods (citrus, vinegar, wine) are all my absolute favorites, so you can imagine how bummed I was when I was doing the Acid Watcher diet. Is it possible to have craved acidic foods for this reason? Just a passing thought.

Another thing -- I have gustatory rhinitis, as does my dad (who also has insane digestion issues but just ignores them and his belly is already so big and round he'd never know if he was bloated or not anyway). I have kept track of that in my food journal too, wondering if it's somehow related, but it never seems straighforwardly connected, like ""I ate X and it made me sneeze, and later I was also bloated really badly."" It's more like ""I ate X and it made me sneeze. At a different time, I ate Y and got indigestion and bloating, but never sneezed.""

Anyway, sorry for the essay. I am going to look into scheduling an appmt with a dietician, but in the meantime...I appreciate any input. Oh, and on the FODMAP subreddit, I was told it sounded like I was just trying to treat the symptoms rather than finding the cause. I am most definitely trying to find the cause...doesn't that seem obvious? I can't schedule my own medical tests! I have to wait for my GI to do it.

But on days she isn't there, she fucks us in a whole different direction. This morning there were five of us, one of them wanted to leave early so I said I would stay for her since I missed work while I was sick last week, and I need money badly.

So those three people leave at noon, with asm scheduled to be there in half an hour. So it's just me and the other newer gal. Mind you, we can hold our own. We've been there long enough to handle ourselves. (Or so I thought haha)

But suddenly we are slammed. Lady in the drive wants six drinks, and there are people in the drive still ordering so I can't step away easily to make drinks. Then a lady in the cafe wants us to brew a whole new pot of coffee for her because she wanted blonde and neither of us has been taught to do a pour-over. 

So we are doing our best but barely holding above water with people waiting. Finally, our asm walks in to see us and immediately jumps to help and he's like ""It's just you two?

So I roasted my first beans. Im obsessed with Mexican Chiapas and my local roaster is always out. I ordered them online and roasted them in a pan. I was nervous about over roasting so they are a little light, but have the cocoa/ nutty taste I've grown to love from chiapas. 

I didnt take out any ""bad beans"" or anything. Just took the green beans and roasted them. Let me know what you think based on looking at them, and where should I go next?

A discussion on the ""Hedonic Treadmill.""","I have been swapping between flagship headphones that cost more than most people’s computers. By every objective metric, the sound is perfection. The instrument separation is distinct and the details are crystal clear.

Yet I still find myself looking for the next upgrade. It has actually become a strange morning ritual. The moment I wake up, before I even get out of bed, my mind is already racing through different headphone models and hypothetical DAC or amp configurations. I catch myself obsessing over gear combinations before I have even had coffee. I am still starving for something else.

I want to trigger a discussion about why we are like this. Why is ""good enough"" never actually enough in this hobby?

1. The curse of brain adaptation

The first time I heard high-end gear, it was a revelation. But here is the problem we ignore. After two weeks of daily listening, that incredible resolution stops being special. It becomes ""normal."" Psychologists call this the Hedonic Treadmill. Our brains adapt to the improvement so fast that the $3,000 experience eventually feels mundane. We aren't buying better sound. We are buying a temporary dopamine hit that wears off as soon as our ears adjust.

2. Confusing ""Better"" with ""Different""

I suspect many of us keep spending money just to get a slightly different sound signature. We buy one headphone for the ""airiness"" and another for the ""slam."" We justify it by writing long paragraphs about technicalities. But are we really just bored? It feels like we are paying a premium just to hear our favorite songs flavored with a different spice, not because the audio quality is actually improving.

3. The gear has replaced the music

This is the part that explains the endless discussions on details. When I get a new headphone, I don't listen to the song. I listen to the treble decay. I listen to the separation of the violins. I am dissecting the sound rather than enjoying the art. The music has become nothing more than a tool to test the equipment.

My question to the community:

Have you ever actually reached a point where you stopped wanting more? Or is the ""Endgame"" just a myth we tell ourselves to justify the next purchase?

I’m autistic.,"I’m autistic and have a handful of chronic illnesses, so I’m noticing some things that I assume are part of the human experience are actually unique to me. So this is a list of things my body does, and I just want a yes or no for if it’s experienced by others. 

From TV I know hair on your big toe, hitting your funny bone, and Charley horse cramps are normal.

1. I have like 10 hairs on my areoles (I tweeze a few one a week). (This is the one that started the question).

2. My hairstylist used an electric razor to clean up my hair line. All the hairs turned into white heads, after I popped those, they turned into ingrown hairs with oil plugs. After I popped that they became normal. (For some reason I think this is the ‘military men get beard waver condition). 

3. When I shave my legs (exfoliate, use shaving cream and fresh safety razor, go knee to ankle, moisturize). I get 20 white heads/ ingrown hairs/ oil clogged pores per leg. 

4. My lower back area (tramp stamp area) is covered in small clogged pores, not black heads color, just oil colored. 

5. TW: bowel movements: I used to only poop when I was anxious, from high school to college I only pooped when I had coffee or had an exam that day. Now, without all that anxiety, I only go once every 3 days or more. I have also gone 3 times with 20+ days, without any discomfort. (I think the lack of discomfort is related to my h-EDS). 

6. Sometimes I wake up with my eyes sore. So I spend the day with my eyes closed and applying an ice pack. I just assume I dreamed too much. 

7. TW: female parts: I have POTS, which is known for blood pooling, and I’ve seen people post pictures of their thighs being purple. But when I push my self to do a good bit of standing (with out compression socks), ie. doing the dishes or vacuuming. At the next restroom break, I notice my (lady) bits are purple. Does this surpass the allowable blood pooling from POTS. 

8. I get clogged pores on my abdomen, when I squeeze them, the spot becomes a white head, then becomes an ingrown peach fuzz hair, then becomes normal. ",2,1769976118.0,NoStupidQuestions,2,0.75,False

spent way too much time studying social dynamics because i was tired of being the ""nice guy"" everyone walked over. read countless books on psychology, binged Robert Greene podcasts, watched hours of Charisma on Command breakdowns. here's what actually works.

turns out most of us confuse being likable with being respected. society basically trains us to be people-pleasers from day one. your biology's working against you too, humans are wired to avoid conflict and seek approval. but here's the thing: you can shift this dynamic once you understand the actual mechanics of respect.

set boundaries early and hold them

people treat you how you teach them to treat you. sounds harsh but it's true. when someone crosses a line, address it immediately. not aggressively, just clearly. ""hey, that doesn't work for me"" is a complete sentence. 

the first time you let something slide, you've set a precedent. the book *Boundaries* by Dr. Henry Cloud changed how i think about this. Cloud's a clinical psychologist who's worked with everyone from Fortune 500 execs to struggling addicts. the core insight: boundaries aren't walls, they're property lines. you're just showing people where your yard ends and theirs begins. this is the best practical guide on personal boundaries i've ever read. it'll make you question everything you thought you knew about being ""nice.""

stop over-explaining yourself

notice how respected people don't justify every decision? they just state what they're doing and move on. when you over-explain, you're subconsciously signaling that you need permission or approval.

""i can't make it"" vs ""i can't make it because my cousin's friend is visiting and i promised i'd help them move but actually they might not even need help and...""

see the difference? the second version screams insecurity. say what you need to say, then zip it.

become genuinely competent at something

respect follows competence. pick one area and get really fucking good at it. doesn't matter if it's your job, a hobby, or how you make coffee. when people see you've mastered something, they automatically respect you more in other areas too.

Daniel Coyle's *The Talent Code* breaks down how skill development actually works. Coyle spent years studying talent hotbeds worldwide. key takeaway: deep practice beats natural ability every time. insanely good read if you want to stop being mediocre at everything.

If you want to go deeper on social dynamics and assertiveness but prefer audio learning that fits your commute, there's an app called BeFreed that's been really useful. It's a personalized learning platform that pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert talks to create custom podcasts based on what you're trying to improve. 

You can set a specific goal like ""build confidence as a people-pleaser"" or ""learn to set boundaries without guilt"" and it generates a structured learning plan with content tailored to your situation. The depth is adjustable too, you can do quick 15-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives with real examples when you want more detail. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, so the content quality is solid and science-backed. The voice options make it actually enjoyable to listen to, which helps when you're trying to replace scrolling time with something productive.

for tracking skill development, i use an app called Strides. it's a habit and goal tracker that lets you measure progress objectively. helps you see improvement when your brain's telling you you're not getting anywhere.

match energy, don't exceed it

when someone's rude or dismissive, your instinct might be to try harder to win them over. terrible move. instead, match their energy level. if they're cold, you be professional but distant. if they're warm, reciprocate.

this isn't about being petty. it's about not rewarding bad behavior with extra effort. people subconsciously notice when you're chasing their approval, and it tanks your value in their eyes.

cultivate the ability to walk away

the most powerful position in any dynamic is being genuinely okay with walking away. relationships, jobs, friendships, whatever. when you're not desperately clinging to something, people sense it.

this doesn't mean being flaky or commitment-phobic. it means having enough self-respect that you won't tolerate being consistently disrespected. build your life so you have options. multiple income streams, strong friendships, hobbies you're passionate about. makes it way easier to enforce boundaries when you're not terrified of losing any single thing.

*No More Mr. Nice Guy* by Dr. Robert Glover is essential here. Glover's a therapist who specialized in helping people-pleasers reclaim their self-respect. the book's premise: being ""nice"" is often just covert manipulation. we do favors expecting something back, then resent people when they don't reciprocate. brutal but necessary wake-up call.

speak less, observe more

talked to a guy who negotiates hostage situations for a living (heard him on the *Negotiation Academy Podcast*). his main advice: people who talk the most have the least power. when you're constantly filling silence, you're giving away information and control.

practice being comfortable with pauses in conversation. let other people rush to fill the void. you'll learn more about them, and they'll perceive you as more thoughtful and confident.

the shift happens gradually. you're literally rewiring neural pathways that have been reinforced for years. some people won't like the change. they benefited from the old dynamic where they could push you around. that's fine. let them go.

respect isn't about being an asshole or developing some fake alpha persona. it's about valuing yourself enough to expect decent treatment, and being calm and consistent when you don't get it. most people are so desperate for approval they'll tolerate anything. just being willing to enforce basic standards puts you ahead.",1,1769976108.0,SolidMen,0,1.0,False

I always assumed that feeling was only applicable to breakups, or missing persons cases. I understand that kind of mourning goes much deeper.

 

My wife and I bought farmland in Vermont about a year ago. It was cheap and run-down. To my disappointment, people don’t discount the selling price of a house just because someone died in it. People are less superstitious these days. The real reason this land was so cheap, was because the one farmhouse already put on it was so derelict, having been abandoned. Nearly uninhabitable. I don’t say this lightly: thank God for her brother, who lived in the area and let us set up in his guest room.

 

My brother-in-law, Scott, was a godsend. She called him up, said we had to get out of Massachusetts. He didn’t have any further questions. Just told us to grab what we need and he’d have a room ready for us. I think he was partly so eager for company, having just gotten out of service. Honorably discharged, not my place to say much more. He didn’t have a wife or kids. He and Buck were always close.

 

I could go to work at the bakery in town, and my wife could work on the house. Billie Jo was her name. Everyone who knew her called her Buck as a kid. She has a different story every time someone asked her. One time, she told someone it was for the one-hundred and fifty-pound deer she shot when she was only eleven, only her second hunting trip with her dad. Another time, she said it was when she got kicked in the head by a young colt she was trying to help her mother tame when she was a teen. I think it’s just because she was always a tomboy.

 

It was a solid six months until we could move into the house. Buck was good with her hands. Did the plumbing herself, the drywall, the painting. Thankfully, the structure of the house was still good. Every day I got home from work, there would be more done. More tile, more shelves put up. Her brother helped with the electrical setup. Buck was smart, but never had a head for numbers. That was her brother and her dad’s territory.

 

It was April when I called her. It was a rough day dealing with a client. She wanted an “egg free” cake for her son. My guess was vegan. Or maybe the kid had a legitimate allergy and mentally belittling her for what felt like an arbitrary lifestyle choice makes me feel less guilty for being angry at the woman who shouted at me that the cake “wasn’t fluffy like it was on display,” and that her son (age six) was going to be disappointed. It was like arguing with a brick wall. Of course, it was made more difficult when she decided to pick this fight with me right before closing. My manager told me to remake the cake, which was going to have to wait until tomorrow, so I had that hanging over my head.

 

I got in my car and thought about the half-done house I was going home to, the bills we still had to pay, the storage unit we were still renting for furniture and other belongings that couldn’t go in the house just yet. There’s something about being yelled at by a middle-classed mother of two that really brings all your worries bubbling up to the surface. All I wanted was to hear my wife’s voice.

 

After a few minutes crying in the car, I called her up. I wanted to remind myself about the best thing I had to come home to. She could tell right away I’d been crying. She had a sixth sense for when I wasn’t quite myself.

 

“Sabrina?” Hearing her voice was the closest I had to feeling her strong arms around me, pulling me close to her soft, warm body. “What happened?”

 

“Just a rough day at work.” Even I didn’t believe myself. My voice was wet, nasally and raw from the several minutes I’d spent crying my mascara off.

 

There was an exhale on the other line that substituted for beating the living crap out of whoever made me feel so small. “Tell you what,” she told me, “Let’s take a walk when you get home. It’s supposed to be warm tonight, and we still need to see what lumber we can sell off. That’ll cover the expenses for the drywall and the repairs the truck needs, and we might even have some to stash away. How’s that sound?”

 

That was Buck. Always a doer, an optimist. Some days, I wasn’t sure what I’d do without her smile to come home to. “That sounds great… We could see the lake. That’s on our property, right?”

 

“Sure is. Maybe I can borrow John’s tractor and clear some of the brush out. Bet it’ll look gorgeous in the morning, when the sun comes up.”

 

I turned the key in the ignition. “I’ll be home soon. I love you.”

 

“Love you, too, Beanie.”

 

I ended the call and started for home, occasionally sniffing. No one made me feel at home like she did.

 

Walking out to the lake was calming. My grandmother used to hike, and I’d go with her before her hip surgery kept her at home. The sun setting through the colorful leaves as the seasons just started to turn, laughing with my wife, letting her overexplain every little thing.

 

There was a log from a fallen tree we liked to sit on by the lake. She’d put her arm around me and draw me in close, we’d watch the birds fly. In summer, we could hear the woodpeckers tapping at the distant trees, and see the mallards gliding across the surface.

My attention was caught by something along the side. Buck caught on when I stood up. We walked over together to find a box turtle, long since dead. There was a fishing line caught around its neck and foreleg, limbs cold and stiff from how long it had been there. I felt my heart sink, thinking of how the poor thing struggled against the trap long forgotten, not even meant for it.

 

Buck squeezed my shoulder. “Beanie, don’t be sad… He’s not hurting anymore.” When I didn’t respond right away, she stepped forward. I heard the mush of her boots sinking into the mud before she knelt down. Using her pocket knife, she cut the line and stood, showing me the body of the reptile. “My brother and I used to bury dead animals we found in the woods, let nature take the meat and the guts. Then the bones are left. His shell would look pretty on the mantle, don’t you think? Right above the fireplace?”

 

Maybe I was feeling melancholy from the events at work, and I was just feeling a little extra sensitive about a dead turtle. Still, I wasn’t so attached that thinking of it as a decoration didn’t cheer me up a little. I nodded, bumping her shoulder with my forehead in a silent, affectionate thanks.

 

Getting home, Buck buried the turtle right where the stones outlined my future flower bed so we could find it again once nature took its course. She remarked later while reading on the sofa that she should have buried it a bit deeper. I told her it was fine where it was.

 

It was the following afternoon. Buck had borrowed that tractor like she mentioned. There was a light drizzle of the rain from earlier tapering off, but Billie didn’t want to wait. What little forest litter that could be torn away without selling it for lumber, she cleared out. Around the lake, and a little further. She was still out there when I got home. I could hear the engine plugging and the blades of the rotary cutter attachment when I got out of the shower, echoing through the gentle patter of the rain.

 

I was making tea in the early evening, when I heard it stop suddenly in the distance. It was an older tractor. Sometimes, it needed to be restarted. John showed Buck all the tricks it took to get it running again. When I didn’t hear it come back for about ten minutes, I expected to see her trudging back to the house with twigs in her hair and mud on her jeans.

 

Another five minutes where nothing happened. I called her cell, which went straight to voicemail. I tried two more times. She always keeps her phone on her, ever since falling off the roof and busting her ass that spring, I all but glued it to her hand in case of emergencies. She wasn’t stupid, by any means, but I knew she could be reckless.

 

I’d gotten my waders on to go looking for her, when I heard my phone buzz. A frustrated sigh of relief left me as I answered. “Billie Jo, where are you?”

 

“Beanie! Hon, I’m sorry. I lost connection in the cave.”

 

That broke me out of my protective anger for a moment. “The cave?” I didn’t know we had a cave on our property. Evidently, neither did Buck from the sound of her excitement.

 

“Yeah! I’ll fire up the tractor and come get you. We couldn’t see the entrance from all the brush. I bet it’s somethin’ special. We gotta call up Scott and ask him about it.”

 

I wasn’t initially in the mood to entertain her strange interests, but you make sacrifices for the ones you love. Even little ones like time and comfort. Plus, she was willing to come get me. “Alright. I’m here on the porch when you—” I was cut off when I heard the tractor fire up on her end. She said something, but I couldn’t quite make it out. I waited on the porch after she ended the call. By the time I stepped out, the rain had stopped. The ground was still soggy, which still warranted the waders.

 

The cave wasn’t anything magnificent. The opening was on the opposing side of the hill, where the brush had kept it from view. We were always so focused on the lake when we got out this way, we never even thought of trekking over that hill. Buck shut the tractor off and hopped down, grinning like a kid. Even at her age, she got so excited over this kind of thing. Caves, bugs, animals, anything in the woods. She and my grandmother would have gotten along.

 

I let her lead the way, her rough hand supporting my delicate fingers as I stepped down into the opening. In my free hand, I held my phone’s flashlight. The way she spoke, I was expecting the inside to be glittering with gemstones, or the ceiling to be dripping with stalactites. Instead, it looked more or less like a straight, hollow tunnel.

 

Buck ran her hands along the insides of the cave. “See?”

 

“I see it, babe.”

 

“No, really. Look here.” She touched an area where the surface was raised with nodules that looked like they’d been eroded away by time and water. It hardly looked like it was made with any sort of intelligence. I wasn’t sure what it was she wanted me to see.

 

“It’s, uh… Is there anything else?”

 

She looked back at me, a little confused. “You really don’t see it?”

See what? What was I supposed to be looking at? “I think you’ve spent a little too much time in the sun.”

 

“Yeah. Maybe.” She looked back at the wall, where her fingers still ghosted over. “Still… Maybe this’ll, I dunno, increase the value of the land?”

 

I smiled and touched her shoulder, wanting to go home. “We can ask Scott about it. It’s gonna get dark soon.”

 

“Right. Right… I’ll finish the brush tomorrow and get John his tractor back. We owe him.”

 

“For the view to the lake? Hell yeah, we do.” I kissed her cheek, tasting the salt of hard work on her skin. Even in the cool air, she worked her body like a machine. We rode home to cuddle on the sofa to watch through another sitcom while we turned our brains off and sank into our shared warmth. I can still remember the way my head fit into the curve of her neck, the occasional kisses that would gently land on my forehead.

 

The first red flag I can remember came later that week.

 

Buck spent more and more time in that cave. She’d take pictures of the interior, even bring charcoal rubbings of the walls inside. One night, I came home to see her sitting at the dining room table, various scraps of paper laid out in neat rows, like a puzzle with some unforeseen end. I wasn’t sure how long she’d been studying them. She was a bloodhound, tracing an unfamiliar scent.

 

I put my bag down and came over to her side, peeking over her shoulder. “What’s that, hon?” I knew what it was, I just hoped she could shed some light on exactly what it was about the cave she thought was so intriguing.

 

She didn’t even look up at me, not at first. Brunette strands fell out of her messy bun as she studied the charcoal like text. “It’s like it spells something out.”

 

“What?”

 

“Like a sentence. Or a paragraph. I don’t know, but it looks like someone tried to write something. There’s…” She made a noncommittal gesture with one hand. “…a message. Or a warning. Something important.”

 

I didn’t see it. Looking over the charcoal reflections of the cave texture, I didn’t see what she was talking about. Even as she tried to rearrange some of them, she couldn’t seem to reach a conclusion that made sense to her. I couldn’t even find the beginning.

 

Finally, she stood up, taking her glasses off and massaging the bridge of her nose. I stood beside her, taking her arm in my hands. “Come on. I’ll throw a frozen lasagna in the oven.”

 

She nodded, drowsily. “Yeah.”

 

Walking into the kitchen, I noticed the cabinets still leaned against the side of the refrigerator. I tallied them up with the rolls of wallpaper gathering dust upstairs, reminding myself to be patient. Buck had been working so hard on the house. Now, it actually held heat with winter coming up. I could let her fixate on her strange hobby for a while. I thought it would help her reset.

 

It was late fall, when I’d come home to find our dining room had been decorated with more of those charcoal rubbings. They were scattered around the table, some of them hung on the wall with scotch tape. I caught my wife, frantically switching them around like mismatched puzzle pieces. “Buck?”

 

Her head snapped over to make eye contact. “Beanie. Hey… Sorry.” She looked back to her work. “I, um, got a little carried away.”

 

Taking off my coat, I folded it over one of the dining room chairs. “How long have you been…” My eyes roamed over the wall, arms crossed. I felt my lips press into a thin line. “…working on this?”

 

Buck brushed her hand through her bangs, which did little to fix them out of her face. “I lost track of time. But you just got home, so… Maybe a few hours.” Even as she spoke, her eyes roamed over the papers, every little scrap holding her attention for a few seconds before searching for another space to rest.

 

Buck wasn’t the kind to get wrapped up in conspiracies or campfire stories. She had the work ethic of a draft horse. All I could think of was the dust gathering on the cabinets and the wallpaper that I wanted up ages ago.

 

She must have seen the irritation on my face, because her own was cast down at her feet like a child awaiting a tongue lashing. “I can take them down, if…”

 

“No.” I didn’t see much of a point. I was tired and I’d just gotten home from work. All I wanted was to read and fall asleep together after a hot shower. I forced myself to disregard the strange rubbings on the wall. “No, it’s fine. Just leave them for now.” I stole a quick kiss from her cheek, then headed upstairs to the bathroom. Before I disappeared around the corner, I caught a glimpse of my wife rearranging some of the images on the wall.

 

She was pretty excited about those charcoal images she made. Once, she stopped by work to bring my lunch. By the time I came out, she had already struck up a conversation with the girl at the counter about them, even showing pictures on her phone.

 

I overheard her talking to her mother about them more than once, talking about these unseen patterns like they were pieces to a puzzle to be solved. I’m not entirely sure what her mother had to say about them. I felt bad enough eavesdropping on her conversation.

 

It was the same thing when we had dinner with her brother. She kept obsessing over this new hobby of hers.

 

Scott was the only one who had the standing with her not to be overly patient. “That cave? I’ve seen it. Plenty of kids used to play near it. There’s a few more like it off in the woods.”

 

Buck’s eyes lit up at that, and my stomach dropped. I thought, great. More caves for her to obsess over, rather than getting what we needed done.

 

“Seriously?” she asked.

 

He nodded. “There’s a local museum in town. Nothing flashy, but has a few exhibits on what makes the town special. The kids in the school write a paper on their favorite one every year for their fifth-grade final project.”

 

“And there’s one on the caves?”

 

“There’s one on the caves.”

 

I could have smacked him in that moment, the way he was feeding into her obsession. This was becoming more than just a hobby. It was taking time from getting the house together. “I don’t know if—”

 

But I was stopped when I felt Buck’s calloused hand around my own. “Please? Look, I just wanna see if the museum has anything on the patterns I found. I promise, I’ll get the wallpaper up and fix the back door and, and… Whatever else on my honey-do list.”

 

I had a feeling it was a bit of a false hope, but my wife was a promise keeper. “Alright. Tomorrow, after work, let’s get the cabinets up. Then Saturday, we’ll check out the museum.”

 

I was rewarded with a kiss on my temple while I took another bite of garlic bread. Maybe it wasn’t such a bad idea on Scott’s end to bring her to the museum. Maybe someone could tell her that her charcoal rubbings were neat, tell her something about the erosion patterns, then she could focus on things that mattered.

 

Some days, I used to think Scott knew Buck better than I did. He was younger by a few years, but they clicked like they were two halves of the same whole. I guess that’s siblings. I can only speculate, I grew up an only child.

 

They didn’t look alike. Scott looked like his mother, with deep brown eyes and striking blonde hair. Buck’s green eyes contrasted with his dark gaze.

 

Bringing us to the local museum, Buck was more quiet than usual. Scott must have assumed she just missed her morning coffee, or was in kind of a mood. He and I still filled the silence with light conversation on the drive over. I still kept stealing glances over at Buck, who would occasionally contribute to the conversation with little more than an affirmative nod, or a non-committal noise of sorts.

 

Getting to the museum, a little of her usual light came back. I wish I realized then how unusual that was, for someone to be so distant, only to come back when a certain interest was mentioned. It wasn’t as if it was something to hold her attention, it was like it was becoming a reason to live.

 

Again, Scott didn’t see anything wrong. I hadn’t told him about the cave rubbings that plastered our wall, or the unfinished projects that went unnoticed.

 

It was a small museum, set up locally in what used to be a thrift store. From what Scott told us, the building was bought by one of those “salt-of-the-earth” families after the previous owner lost her husband and wanted to retire. I don’t think my wife was listening. I knew what was truly on her mind. Luckily, it was a cold day. Not many people wandering around.

 

When we got to the exhibit she was looking for, I think she was disappointed by just how little it stood out from the rest of the museum. Most exhibits were about the first colonies, the founders, trades, the sort of things that kids write papers about.

 

The caves (yes, multiple caves like Scott said, not just the one my wife was excited about) were one exhibit. Explained mostly by copper mines and the occasional natural cave, I’m still not fully sure if any of the structures were specifically referencing the one on our property.

 

Normally, she’d have shrugged it off. I watched her study the plaque, shaking her head in disapproval a few times, finally muttering something that sounded akin to, “No, that’s not right.”

 

At this point, I was a little on edge. I was shorter with her than I needed to be. There was so much to be done, and I was over her strange obsession. All I could think about was the unfinished house I would still come back to that would continue to be neglected so long as Buck stayed deluded over this tunnel. “Honey, it’s a cave. There’s a dozen like them, even more across the state. It’s nothing special.”

 

“That’s not…” She cut herself off with an agitated exhale through her nose, the way a horse snorts when uncomfortable. Her arms were crossed, eyes scanning over the lines of the plaque again. “They didn’t even mention the patterns!”

 

“Billie, what patterns? No one else sees patterns. You’re the only one taking textures and reading what’s not there.”

 

“Textures?” This was the first either of us had hinted to Scott as to how far her fascination had dragged her down.

 

At this, she raised her voice. I don’t do well with public outbursts. The way her eyes widened, as if angrily pleading with me or anyone else. “You don’t look! No one ever looks! Someone put those messages there for someone, but—”

 

I tried to calm her down. Not just for her sake, but for my own reputation. I could feel the eyes of the docent and the one other homeschool family present on us. I barely registered Scott was there. “We can talk about this at home.”

 

“They’re trying to talk to us. They’re reaching out! Like… like breadcrumbs! We understand them now. As a species, we can see what they left for us! We can speak to them now, if you all would just listen to me!”

 

“Billie.” Scott tried to touch her shoulder.

 

She jumped away like he tried to jab her with a hot poker. “Stay away from me! Don’t look at me like that, I’m the only one who sees it because I’m the only one who takes time to read! All of you, rushing through, trying to write your own patterns that no one else is going to see. None of you understand, this…” She gestured wildly to the display on the mining caves, the rest of the museum, or maybe the world. “This won’t last! What I’m trying to show you will last! Beyond any of us!”

 

I’d never seen her so inconsolable. In all of our spats, our petty squabbles, I had never seen her so aggravated. I’m not even sure I’d call it angry. She just had so much trapped inside, like a tiger pacing around its cage, if that tiger started rambling to other tigers about traffic lights and taxes and all other manner of things beyond them.

 

That was when Scott grabbed her hand. He held it tight, tight enough to remind her where she was, as if he could nail her brain to the ground through the nerves in her palm.

 

I watched her freeze. Frenzied tears were suspended in her eyes, then shame overtook her as she recognized the small audience she’d gathered. It was as if she’d walked through a familiar door, only to be shocked that she was suddenly standing in a room she didn’t recognize.

 

I didn’t take her hand. I just watched her a moment. Those few seconds went on for what felt like minutes. I was more concerned over my own reputation, how these strangers saw us, saw me, than I was for my own spouse. My life partner, clearly in crisis, and all I could think about was what I might say if any of these strangers would find their way into my shop the next day.

 

Scott spoke up. “Time to go.” His words were hushed, chilly, but not unkind. He recognized he needed to salvage what he could, but I knew that look. He’d never seen her worked up like that before, not in the years they’d spent growing up together.

 

He drove us home. The air in the truck was thick, tense. I don’t know exactly what Scott was thinking. I could hear my wife sniffle occasionally in the backseat. I didn’t say anything. I should have. I wish I had. It wouldn’t have made a difference of the outcome, but maybe she wouldn’t have doubted my care for her.

 

Scott lingered on the porch with me as Buck went inside. I think he was following my body language. I didn’t want him to see the mess that was inside, the unpacked boxes sitting in careless piles beneath the unhung cupboards.

 

He only said to me: “Take care of her.”

 

I was her wife. Why would he have any reason to doubt me? I simply nodded, but he made sure to meet my eyes when he said it again.

 

“Take care of her, Sabrina.”

 

I stayed on the porch, the late fall chill biting through my sweater. When I came inside, Billie was already asleep. I stayed up for a while longer, reading by myself on the sofa. When I finally joined her in bed, she had long since been asleep, occasionally muttering. I couldn’t remember a time when she’d talked in her sleep before then. She slept with her back to me, I with my back to her. I wondered if I could have that cave filled in, if there was money after the lumber was collected. If it didn’t solve her obsession, it would at least keep her out of it. She’d have no choice but to move on then.",1,1769975848.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I am currently a custom cake baker for events and weddings, and plan to move my business into the cafe to create cakes from the kitchen of my small shop.

I was named after her (Stella) and thought to include our name somehow to bring notice to her warmth, and that my cafe used to be her home. So, I need a name that isn't specific to cakes or coffee but isn't too restaruatny (since I won't be waiting on customers and will only be offering grab-and-go foods). The vibe for the shop will be cozy, inviting, and unique. I'd love to cultivate a place that invites people in and offers a space for community gathering. 

  
My name ideas now are: 

\- Stella's Place (""*bakery and cafe"" in smaller font)*

*-*Stella's Table (to call back to everyone gathering around her table. I worry that this won't be very good for my cake business, though)

**Full story:** I’ve only had 2 urine tests through my probation (in Texas, Collin County), with the first being dilute unintentionally (I was worried I wouldn’t be able to pee, so drank a glass of water the same hour I had coffee before the test and apparently that diluted too much). My PO only told me in that same meeting the day of that first test that I shouldn’t drink too many liquids. Second test I really kept my liquid intake to a minimum (like only 12 oz of coffee 2 hrs before testing) and my urine test was fine.

Both of those tests were in the morning. This is the first time my test will be in the evening, about 5 pm. Obviously it doesn’t make sense to not drink anything all day. Any tips on making sure my urine sample isn’t dilute?

Also, I should be starting my period tomorrow… any women here that have had to test while on their period? Any problems with having to do so?

REALLY hoping I can have a good urine test so my lawyer can go back and re-request early release. I’m past the halfway point of my deferred probation, and I was able to get the judge to grant the IiD removal, but the ONLY reason they didn’t grant early release was because of that dang dilute test 🤦🏼‍♀️ so frustrating.

New year’s resolution is sticking this time around!! Lost about 6 lbs since November, but only recently really locked in. I believe I am considered skinny fat based on my amount of body fat.

My current set up looks like this:

• 1,350 calories daily (losing 0.5 lbs weekly) 

• 10-15k steps average (warehouse job)

• 20-40 min cardio at home daily (dancing usually) 

• “power pilates” on a reformer (1 hr) once a week 

I haven’t paid too much attention to protein/carb/fiber goals so far. 

Breakfast is usually granola balls and congee made with bone broth, a whole egg, and fruit. My lunches are usually simple stir-fries of a protein (chinese sausage, shaved beef, or thin sliced pork) and a green like bok choy or gai lan with a small bowl of rice. Dinner is a wild card, but usually something similar to lunch or (unfortunately) something like Taco Bell or In N Out lol. I have lots of tea and coffee through out the day. 

I feel like there isn’t much fat to cut from my diet anymore, and pilates has improved my posture which makes me look a little leaner, but I feel like I need to do something more to get rid of the visceral fat (mostly on my stomach).

It’s taken a right while to get here. Looking back on it, you’re not even sure how you did. You’re just lucky you got to the cabin right before the last few streaks of sunlight receded, the mountain road was already rough enough.

Using the *strangely wooden* key you’d been provided with, the door creaks it’s way open, revealing largely what you’d expect for a cozy woodland retreat such as this.

 Yet something’s just *off*, it’s like whoever designed this had never seen the interior of a house before and was just guessing how things looked, either way the designer is just crap at their job. Coffee table too short, bed shaped like a circle you know that kind of thing. Resting on the pillow is a worn-down piece of paper. Picking it up you find a set of rules:

 “1.For the poor unlucky fuck who’s reading this PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD JUST LEAVE! GET BACK INTO YOUR CAR IF IT HASN’T GOTTEN TO IT. IF IT’S SLASHED THE TIRES JUST DRIVE ANYWAY. JUST PLEASE LEAVE, LEAVE.

2. If you’ve gotten here after dark or for *whatever* reason you don’t want to leave. Please just lock the door behind you. It’s not going to stop it if things go to shit, but it’ll keep you safe for now. You’re here as advertised

3. None of this is *real*. Just think back to the flyer. What contest did you enter? None right? Just thought you got lucky, didn’t bother to question the sloppy presentation. Didn’t even notice there wasn’t an address.

4. Don’t eat the food here. Don’t even drink for that matter. The stuff in the fridge may *look* normal, but it isn’t. I can feel something *squirming* inside.  You can’t trust any of it.

5a. You can’t eat anything here, so you’re going to want to go hunting. There’s a few knives in the drawers, make a spear or whatever. If you can’t stomach killing an animal, just swallow your pride. It’s you or them.

5b. You’re going to put as much of the survival knowledge you already have to the limits here. It’s cutoff communication to the outside.

5c. If you see any animals that look *wrong* like they’re moving to *smoothly* just back away before they notice you. Do the same if the trees are creaking louder than usual. It’s in the area.

5d. To be safe, you’ll want to be a carnivore for a few days, don’t want to risk eating some dodgy berry.

6. Close the curtains before you try and fall asleep. Don’t listen to the noises.

7. Don’t acknowledge any changes to the outside upon waking up. Go back to bed and hope it loses interest.

8. People you know will come to the door, don’t acknowledge them, don’t speak to them and for the love of all that is holy. DON’T. OPEN. THE. FUCKING. DOOR.

8b. I’m sorry, I lost my temper. To be more clear, they won’t look normal, they’ll never blink, they’ll look like they’re a puppet on strings. Just don’t let it know you’re here.

9. If you wake up and you find yourself somewhere deeply familiar to you. I’m sorry but it’s likely your time is up. You can’t bargain with it, can’t make deals with it, can’t plead, can’t beg. If there’s some way to escape. Well….I sure as shit haven’t found it.

10. I don’t even know what’s real anymore, is any of this even actually happening. Have I just gone crazy? Didn’t even follow my own advice about the fucking food. If this thing is here, it can just kill me already. I’m done fighting.""",2,1769974869.0,Ruleshorror,2,1.0,False

What do I do?,"What do I do when my boyfriend (21M) won't defend or stand up for me (21F) when his friends treat me poorly. For more context, my boyfriend (we can call him S) and I have been together for 3 and a half years, but we have been friends since we were 14 years old. S is what I have always considered the most perfect boy, he is kind and caring and I have always imagined spending the rest of my life with him. However, there has always been reoccurring issues regarding his friends and the way they treat me and it is becoming something that is making me question my future with S.

S has five close guy friends. Garry is his best friend, but he is also his cousin. Two of S's other friends he met around the age of 6 through soccer, we can call them Larry and Joe. His other friend is Jared who is Larry's cousin. He has a bigger friend group that consists of Garry's fiance, Ulga and her sister and two female cousins. So basically, his friend group is just one big family reunion. 

Three and a half years ago when S and I started dating, he told me about how excited Ulga was to meet me. When the day came for us to meet, I excitedly greeted her and said hi. She instantly gave bad/passive aggressive vibes, was extremely standoffish, and hardly acknowledged me the entire hang out. The rest of his friend group was there and treated me very similarly. S did nothing. I gave them more and more chances. If I hung out with them, I was always ignored and felt like the odd one out. A big part of their friend group dynamic was to have massive sleepovers where most of the people got insanely drunk. I have never been a fan of sleepovers, even with my closest friends as they cause me a lot of anxiety, but I would still show up to their hangouts when invited to show that I wanted to form a relationship with them too. I was always ignored, so I slowly stopped showing up to hang outs. Things escalated when one time I went to hang out with them for the first time in a while to get dinner, they found out I was not going to their group sleepover after and Ulga got extremely mad and started sending me rude texts that nights. Another time, S and I were spending the day and night together and were not going to one of their sleepover hang outs. When Ulga found out that this is why we weren't going, she and her sister got mad and started going off in the group chat about how I was being disrespectful for not going, etc. I am not one for drama so I began to distance myself from people who treat me poorly for no apparent reason. On top of that, S ad Garry made Ulga and I apologize to each other to ""fix things"". Why the heck do I need to apologize for doing NOTHING WRONG? 

There have also been instances in the past where Garry has been upright rude to me for literally no reason (in front of S), and S has just sat there not saying a word. One example of this happened when we went on a road trip. I was one of the drivers and the day before we left we were trying to plan leaving the next morning. This was a road trip with most of his friends. Ulga said she wanted to wake up at 8am and Garry wanted to stay in that town until 12pm. The thing is the drive was a 8-10hr drive, we had to drive through two major cities with terrible traffic, and once I dropped them off at their house I had an extra 1 hr and 20mins to get back to mine. When I mentioned how I had planned on leaving at 7:30am (like we did on the way there) so we could get breakfast before leaving (whatever time I gave would take an extra hour for the people I was with to be ready to leave because they can't manage time), Garry got extremely mad at me. He started to raise his voice at me saying it is ridiculous I wanted to leave that early and how nobody would want to wake up to leave at that time. Again, it is the same time we left to get there so I am confused as to what the bog deal was. He kept mentioning how he wanted to f-around in town until 12pm (it was a very small town and there was nothing left to do that we had not already done). He asked everyone ""well who wis going to wake up that early to drive with op then"" MULTIPLE times, and S just sat there staring into the fire pit saying absolutely nothing. To say I felt humiliated is an understatement. I tried to compromise by saying we can go to a cute town on the way home and stop for brunch to wait out major city traffic. Garry then accused me of being a hypocrite and said at that point it is not even worth it and refused to even try to make a compromise. The next day S, Larry, and his gf who is Ulga's cousin, drove in my car. We got a quick breakfast and coffee and headed home. Garry left slightly after us and, to make a point, drove back at 95mph the entire time, beat me back to their place, and acted all stuck up to prove a point that he got there faster. S did not, and has not, even brought this up in private to talk to Garry to tell him that it is not okay to treat me like that.

S has consistently not stood up for me despite me mentioning how it hurts. He says he always feels stuck in the middle. I can't stop thinking about the fact he never defends me and it is making me question my future with him. I can not imagine living the rest of my life being treated this way by most of his friends. It is becoming what feels like a breaking point. I am thinking about asking him to talk to Garry to set boundaries and make it known he is not going to be okay with him treating me like that, and if he is not willing to do this I am breaking up with S. I guess what I am really wondering is what would you do in my situation, would you try to ignore this behavior and go on, would you break up, how do you even go about this when it feels like nothing can be done at this point to change the way they treat me. It makes me upset knowing my own boyfriend doesn't feel the need to defend me. It hurts so bad. He is coming over tonight and we are going to talk more about it. Advice and input is greatly appreciated. What do I do?",2,1769974510.0,whatdoIdo,47,0.57,False

	•	Do the three main characters feel distinct so far?

	•	What do you think about the starters they end up with — do they feel earned and fitting?

The story follows three original trainers leaving Pallet Town, with a focus on Kanto as a lived-in world: travel, culture, Pokémon as wildlife, and consequences rather than just gym speedruns or canon rehashes. It’s aimed at a slightly older audience and takes a more grounded tone.

I’m very open to constructive criticism — pacing, characterisation, prose, anything. Even small notes are helpful.

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read or comment 🙏

Luke slid open his bedroom window and the crisp morning air rushed in to meet him. Spring should have claimed the land weeks ago, but Autumn still clung stubbornly to the dawn, biting at his skin and fogging his breath. The world beyond lay in shadow, Viridian City reduced to silhouettes and quiet lines, a thin smear of orange bleeding along the horizon. He inhaled deeply, the chill burning his lungs clean, and wondered what waited for him beyond today. With a practiced motion, he flipped his cap backward—a familiar ritual, sealing the thought: today is the day.

He turned from the window to survey his room—what he liked to call organized chaos. Clothes draped over the chair, half-scribbled notes and sketches scattered across the floor, yet his desk remained a sanctuary of order. At its centre lay a creased, well-studied map of Kanto. His backpack bulged, packed to bursting, with an old fishing rod sticking awkwardly from its side. A water Pokémon was vital, he knew—his best chance at taking on at least two early gyms, whether Viridian or Pewter—especially if fate denied him a water-type starter.

Professor Oak typically released new trainers into the world in sets of three—three licenses, three Pokémon, usually each aligned to a different element. Once though, a particularly lucky batch had been given three Eevees, which Luke would have taken in a heartbeat. Oak was the most renowned professor in all of Kanto, his reputation drawing aspiring trainers from every corner of the globe. Thank Arceus Luke was a local—and with his mother working at the lab, he never had to worry about being pushed to the back of the line by the rich kids and celebrities who flew in for the privilege.

Each trio of starters was chosen with care, themed like puzzles waiting to be solved. Last month’s selection had been Bellsprout, Poliwag, and Growlithe—a set that could only reach its full potential through rare evolution stones.

What puzzle would Professor Oak set this time? Luke had pressed his mother for hints about the new starters, but she hadn’t given him so much as a breadcrumb. But after days of harassment she did let slip that the elements remained the same as the previous batch: fire, water, and grass.

This was enough for Luke to plan. Water stirred his pulse—fluid, relentless, brimming with quiet strength. Grass called to him too: steady and adaptable, rooted deep like an ancient oak that bent but never broke. Fire, though… fire made him uneasy. Too fierce. Too temperamental. It flared fast and burned out just as quickly—and worse, it was a terrible fit for the road ahead. Viridian meant Giovanni and Ground. Pewter meant Brock and Rock. Then Cerulean—Misty and Water. Luke smirked to himself. Honestly, he’d take a Magikarp over a Vulpix.

Yet another question tugged at him—who would his fellow trainers be? Would they journey together, forging bonds through trial and triumph, or splinter off from the very beginning? The uncertainty gnawed at him almost as much as the waiting.

November had finally arrived—the month of his eighteenth birthday, the last hurdle now behind him. Trainer school was finished, his exams passed, and at last he stood on the threshold of a license. Born late in the year, he’d watched his classmates claim their starters months earlier, racing ahead while he remained behind. But Luke didn’t mind. He had always been something of a loner—easy to overlook, content to stand at the edges. Maybe that was about to change. One day, people would know the name Luke Knight.

Red Ryans, Leaf Dawn, Blue Oak — their names already drifted through Kanto like the beginnings of legend, and they’d only been on their journeys a single year. They had graduated just last spring, earning their licenses from Professor Oak with crowds cheering and cameras flashing. The prodigies. The next wave of heroes.

At least, that was what everyone said.

Luke knew better. Even legends started the same way he did — with a first-stage starter Pokémon and a road stretching out in front of them. No fanfare. No guarantees. Just a dream and the grit to chase it.

Still, those were enormous shoes to fill. And Luke’s ambition was nothing small: he wanted his name engraved in the Hall of Fame, he wanted the Champion’s mantle, he wanted to stand at the summit of the Indigo League and know he had earned every step.

But thousands of trainers set out every year with the same fire burning in their chests.

And not all of them survived the attempt.

The truth gnawed at him, quiet and cold. Just last month, one of Oak’s newest graduates — a boy Luke had sat next to in math class, traded cards with at lunch — had been killed in Viridian Forest. A wild Pinsir had torn through his team when he sent his Growlithe in too recklessly. With his Pokémon gone, his protection vanished. Nature did the rest.

The story had spread fast, whispered through Pallet like a storm warning. And it weighed heavy on Luke’s chest still. The world was beautiful…the rolling hills, the forests alive with song, the rivers bright as glass. But beneath all that wonder, it was unforgiving. Pokémon were companions — but also predators, guardians, and forces of nature.

One mistake was all it took.

Luke tightened his fist around the strap of his bag. Fear didn’t stop him. It focused him.

He had prepared his whole life for this — the studying, the fieldwork, the training, the hours in Oak’s lab cleaning incubators and learning emergency procedures. He would not rush headlong into danger. He would not repeat someone else’s carelessness.

He would not die before his journey even began.

And if he played this world right — respected it, trained smart, never assumed victory — then maybe his name would one day echo through Kanto the way Red, Leaf, and Blue’s did.

Maybe louder.

He swung his backpack onto his shoulders and tightened the straps, sparing one last glance at his room. His childhood map of Kanto, corners curled and sun-faded, still lay at the desk — but he wouldn’t be needing it now. Professor Oak would give him a Pokédex this morning. The newest model. A gift of technology and trust… and maybe a small perk of having a mother who worked in the lab.

He paused at the mirror. Dark hair, green eyes, a face that hadn’t quite decided whether it was done being a kid. A few more years and he might finally look like the kind of trainer who toppled Gyms.

But he couldn’t wait for that.

He took a steadying breath, jaw set, and pulled the door shut behind him.

The stairs creaked under his feet as he bounded down into the open-plan kitchen and living room. Warm lamplight pooled across the space, a soft gold glow that fought back the grey dawn pressing against the windows. It felt unreal — he’d imagined this morning so many times, but now that it was here, everything looked sharper. More important.

His mother, wrapped in her dressing gown, nursed a steaming cup of coffee at the counter. Her hair was tied in a loose knot, the kind she only wore on days that mattered. His father stood at the stove flipping Spearow eggs in the pan, the scent rich and buttery.

For the first time since his alarm had gone off, some of Luke’s restless energy eased. The familiar warmth of home, the smells, the quiet murmur of the kettle on the boil — it grounded him. Reminded him why he wanted to become strong in the first place.

This was the world he was stepping out of.

And the world waiting outside was far larger… and far less forgiving.

“Luke! Come taste your father’s cooking one last time!” his mother, Sally, called, her voice carrying that familiar blend of cheer and barely hidden nerves.

Luke slipped into the kitchen and set his bag beside a chair. “Thanks, guys.”

His father, David, turned from the stove with a broad grin. “My son, finally leaving the nest. Time to make the Knight name proud.”

Luke tried to smile, but something unsteady fluttered beneath his ribs. He sank into a chair, rubbing the back of his neck. “I won’t lie… I’m nervous. What if I fail? I don’t want to disappoint you.”

Sally’s expression softened instantly. She leaned over pressed a kiss to his cheek as she set a steaming mug of coffee in front of him. “My boy, you could never disappoint us. Not ever. If you try your best, stay kind, stay humble, and stay true to yourself, there is no outcome that would make us anything less than proud. We already are.”

She took the seat beside him, her fingers brushing his arm. “The government gives trainer licenses to graduates because Kanto needs trainers — needs protectors. People willing to face the wilds and the dangers outside our towns. Pokéballs made life safer, gave us the ability to tame creatures far stronger than us… but they also gave humans the power to twist Pokémon into weapons.”

Her eyes locked on his, shimmering with a mixture of fear and pride. “I believe there is no truly evil Pokémon. But there are evil people. Promise me you’ll be careful.”

“Be very careful,” David echoed as he plated the Spearow eggs. He shook his head. “Your mother’s right. She and I never made it to the Champion’s seat, but we fought our share of battles — against raging wild Pokémon, yes, but also against humans who thought controlling power meant they could do anything with it.”

Luke’s gaze drifted up to the wall above the counter. Pondering his father’s words. Two framed displays gleamed there: complete sets of Kanto badges, polished and arranged with care, and below them a scattering of Johto badges his parents had earned before settling down.

It was easy to forget, sometimes, that they had lived entire lives before quiet Pallet Town — had once stood before Gym Leaders, braved the same wild roads he was about to walk, faced down dangers he could barely imagine.

“I guess I have a lot to live up to,” Luke murmured.

David chuckled and lowered himself into the chair across from him. “Son… you don’t have to live up to us.”

Sally squeezed his hand. “You just have to live.”

Her smile softened, but her voice grew heavier. “We didn’t stop because we failed, Luke. We stopped because I fell pregnant with you.” She exchanged a brief look with David, a shadow crossing her face. “And because it became too dangerous. Too dangerous to keep putting our lives on the line and hope we’d make it back home. We didn’t want you growing up without a parent. So we retired, settled in Pallet, and passed the baton on. We’d served our duty.”

David folded his arms on the table. “But we nearly died more times than I care to count. Wild Pokémon. Reckless trainers. Accidents. And then… Team Rocket.” His jaw tightened. “Run-ins with them were never fun.”

Sally nodded gravely. “The Indigo League — the Gym Leaders, the Elite Four — the whole system will put pressure on you, son. Once you have a few badges, you’ll be obligated to respond to Tier Threats if they occur nearby.”

She drew a careful breath. “But you don’t have to walk this road for just us.”

Luke shook his head immediately. “I’m not. I’m doing this for me too. For the world. For a future where humans and Pokémon can live safely — together. I believe we’re stronger united.”

Sally’s hand closed around his wrist, her fingers trembling. “Then promise me something.”

Luke met her eyes. “What’s that?”

“Don’t play the hero with Team Rocket. They are no joke, Luke. They will kill you.” Her voice cracked. “We saw friends — good, strong trainers and their Pokémon — cut down in front of us. Your father is alive only because I reached him in time… If I had been one minute later…”

Her words withered into silence.

David placed his hand over hers, then fixed Luke with a steady, unblinking gaze. “She saved my life. After my seventh badge, I thought I could lead a small squad to stop Team Rocket from capturing Articuno. I thought I was ready.” His voice dropped. “I wasn’t. The rest of my squad didn’t make it out. I wouldn’t have either if your mother and her Fearow hadn’t dragged me free at the last second.”

His eyes grew distant. “Everyone else — including the Rocket grunts — froze solid when Articuno was enraged. It was a slaughter.”

He leaned forward, voice firm. “I carry that regret with me always. I don’t want you to make the same mistakes I did. Never underestimate anything. Ever.”

Luke nodded slowly and took a sip of his coffee. It scalded the roof of his mouth — hot, grounding, real.

David exhaled. “And Team Rocket is spreading like a disease across Kanto. Stealing. Brainwashing. Capturing the strongest Pokémon they can get their hands on. And if they ever capture a legendary…” A shiver rolled through him. “The devastation would be unimaginable.”

His gaze softened. “But hear me, son — none of that is worth your life.”

Luke drew a steady breath and nodded. “I understand. I’ll be careful. I promise.”

For a few long seconds, the only sound was the faint hiss of the frying pan.

Then David forced a smile and nudged a plate toward him. “Good. I wouldn’t be a father if I didn’t warn you about the dangers. But the trainer’s road…” His smile widened, nostalgia softening the hard lines of his face. “It’s also a life of adventure. Thrill. Friendship. Fun. It has a beauty to it that your mother and I miss every single day.”

Sally’s eyes brightened, the fear in them easing into warmth. “And you get to experience it fresh, Luke. The badges, the journeys, the friends you’ll make — human and Pokémon.”

Luke felt something warm bloom in his chest. His nerves didn’t vanish, but they shifted — excitement threading through them like a spark catching dry leaves.

Sally reached across the table and cupped his cheek, smiling. “Just don’t forget to send us messages. And photos. Lots of photos.”

David snorted. “And if you catch anything cool, your old man wants bragging rights. I expect updates.”

Luke laughed — genuinely, freely.

“I’ll send everything,” he said. “Even the embarrassing stuff.”

“Oh no,” Sally groaned playfully. “He’s going to send us pictures of Spearow poop, isn’t he?”

“Better than what Blue Oak sends his grandfather,” David muttered.

Luke nearly choked on his eggs.

The three of them laughed together, warmth filling the kitchen like sunlight finally pushing through dawn.

And for a moment — just a moment — the world outside didn’t feel dangerous at all.

It felt full of possibility.

\*

Luke reached the professor’s lab, his pulse quickening as the familiar white building loomed at the end of the path. The sun had only just broken free of the clouds, casting the windows in a faint golden glow. The lab was larger than most of the houses in Pallet Town, its walls pristine and smooth, with a polished glass front and an automated door that seemed oddly futuristic against the sleepy backdrop of the countryside. Antennas and satellite dishes crowned the roof, humming faintly with the steady exchange of research data. The air smelled faintly of cut grass and machine oil, a reminder that this place was equal parts nature and science.

A Dodrio’s signiture cry carried across the crisp morning air, startling a flock of Pidgey from a nearby tree. Luke steadied his cap, squared his shoulders, and stepped forward as the glass doors slid open with a soft hiss.

He froze.

Standing in the entryway was another young man: blonde hair styled just so, a crisp white t-shirt that looked like it had never seen a stain, and blue jeans that probably cost more than Luke’s entire backpack. Brett Valentine.

The arrogant smirk spread across Brett’s face the instant he spotted him.

“Well, look who it is—Lukey-boy. Guess my late birthday really did stick me with the stragglers.”

Luke’s jaw tightened. He’d let comments like that slide for years, laughing them off or swallowing the sting. But not today. Today was his day, and Brett Valentine wasn’t going to drag him back into the role of the kid everyone overlooked. He steadied his breath, his voice carrying a weight it never had before.

“It’s Luke,” he said evenly. “We’ve graduated. Maybe you should leave the schoolyard bullying behind with the rest of your immaturity.”

For the first time, Brett faltered. His smirk didn’t vanish, but it sharpened, like a blade.

Before he could retort, a warm, commanding voice rolled through the lab.

“Now, now, boys.”

Professor Oak strode forward from the depths of the building, his white coat flowing with each step. His hands were clasped behind his back, his gaze kind yet heavy with the wisdom of decades.

“The fiercest rivalries often forge the strongest bonds. But whatever paths you take, trainers must respect one another. Rivalry is tradition, yes—but respect is part of your duty. So let’s leave the high school drama outside and start fresh. Shake hands.”

Brett gave a short, derisive laugh, but Luke didn’t hesitate. He stepped forward, shoulders squared, chest lifted, and thrust out his hand. His eyes locked with Brett’s ice-blue gaze.

For a long heartbeat, Brett didn’t move. The smirk faded. Then, slowly, he reached out and clasped Luke’s hand. His grip was iron, firmer than Luke expected but Luke answered with equal strength, refusing to look away.

“There we are,” Oak said, a note of satisfaction in his tone. “You remind me of my grandson, Blue, and his rival, Red. They too began their journeys with fire in their veins.”

Luke’s lips twitched, fighting the urge to grin. He’d never admit it aloud, but the idea of one day wiping the smug smile off Brett Valentine’s perfect face filled him with a thrill almost as sharp as the thought of his very first Pokémon.

“Professor, who’s the third?” Luke asked.

“Ah, well.” Oak’s eyes glinted with a knowing smile. “She should be here any minute.”

She. Luke frowned. None of the local girls from his class were still waiting for their licenses. Which meant—she wasn’t from Pallet Town.

A sudden roar split the air. Rotor blades. Luke and Brett bolted to the doors as a helicopter descended, whipping the grass flat and scattering dust. A crowd gathered along the fence, necks craned to see which champion or celebrity warranted such an entrance.

The rotors slowed, the cabin door opened, and out stepped a tall woman with auburn hair streaming over her shoulders, her round glasses flashing in the morning light. Elite Four’s Lorelei Frost. Luke’s jaw fell slack. What in Arceus’s name was she doing here?

“Elite Lorelei, welcome to Pallet Town,” Oak greeted warmly.

“Sam, my old friend,” Lorelei replied, embracing him as though they’d known each other for years. “Thank you for having us.”

Another figure emerged behind her. A girl about Luke’s age, auburn hair cascading like her sister’s, sunglasses perched high on her nose. She moved with deliberate, unhurried confidence, and the murmurs in the crowd rose.

“Clara Frost,” Oak said, his voice softer now, “are you ready to begin your journey?”

Clara gave a small, cool smile. “I am, Professor. Thank you again for allowing me to start here.”

Lorelei adjusted her glasses, her tone carrying both pride and amusement. “I told my sister she could begin with a Lapras. Even a Dratini. But she insisted she wanted to start like everyone else.”

Clara lifted her chin. “If I accepted one of those, everyone would say my victories weren’t earned. I don’t want whispers trailing behind me. So I’m here, in Pallet Town.”

Oak’s gaze warmed, his voice almost paternal. “A wise choice. True strength is not given—it’s forged. And Kanto has humbled many who thought themselves invincible.”

Luke felt something stir—respect, despite himself. Brett, however, only smirked, unimpressed.

Clara lowered her sunglasses just enough to sweep her gaze over the boys, sharp as ice, before sliding them back into place. “So… these are my rivals?”

“Yes,” Oak said, motioning toward them. “This is Brett Valentine and Luke Knight—both among the top students in their class and selected to take the trainers path.”

Brett scoffed, folding his arms. “Top students? I was the top student, Professor. Knight here just scraped along behind me.” He flashed Clara a grin, fishing for approval.

Clara’s lips curved faintly. She slid her sunglasses down and let her gaze sweep over them—slow, deliberate.”

“Top students… in Pallet Town high school? How impressive.” Her eyes lingered on Brett, then Luke. “Tell me—have either of you trained in blizzards so fierce your Pokémon could barely breathe? Battled across freezing seas where one mistake meant you both drowned? No? I didn’t think so.”

Luke bristled. “And I suppose you have? Please. No one’s allowed a Pokémon without a license. Not even you. Whatever privilege you’ve got, you’re just as much a newbie as the rest of us.”

Clara slid her sunglasses back into place. “Perhaps. But I’ve trained alongside the Elite Four since I could walk. So forgive me if I don’t quake at the thought of competing with a pampered rich boy and…” Her gaze flicked to Luke, dismissive. “…whoever you are.”

Brett stiffened at being brushed aside. “Spoiled rich boy? I’ve won more tournaments than—”

“Local school tournaments,” Clara cut in smoothly, her tone dripping with contempt. “There’s a difference between fighting for a gold star and fighting for your life.”

The words stung, but Luke refused to flinch. He stepped forward, meeting her gaze head-on, his voice steady and edged with steel.

“The road isn’t decided yet. You might sound ahead now, but a real journey changes everything. Let’s see how well you do when you’re out there with own ordinary Pokemon, just like the rest of us. I could also be strong if someone handed me a Gyrados to play with.”

Clara tilted her head, her smile widening by a fraction. “Hmm well exactly. That’s why I’m here—to prove privilege isn’t the root of my success. We will start together in the same boat. But don’t be shocked when you end up walking in my shadow. After all—” she lifted her hand in a careless gesture, as though it were already written—“not everyone is destined to reach the top.”

Oak cleared his throat, stepping between them before the tension could snap. His voice carried the kind of quiet authority that silenced even the noisiest room.

“That’s enough. Rivalry fuels progress, but arrogance blinds even the strongest trainer. Remember this—every Champion, every Elite Four member, every so-called prodigy once stood where you three stand now: at the beginning. Today, you are equals.”

Clara didn’t answer. She only folded her arms, that infuriating smirk still painted on her lips, as if Oak’s words were meant for the boys alone.

Luke’s hands curled into fists at his sides, heat prickling beneath his skin. He risked a glance at Brett. For once, the smug Valentine mask had cracked—just a twitch in his jaw, but enough. And in that flicker of a moment, Luke realized they were thinking the same thing: this girl wasn’t just another rival. She was the one they would have to beat.

They stepped inside the lab’s main chamber. At the far end, under the gleam of sterile white lights, three Poké Balls rested neatly on a polished podium. Each sphere shimmered faintly, red tops glinting as though alive.

Professor Oak gestured toward them, his voice warm but carrying a gravity that hushed the room. “These are your first partners. Do not mistake this for a simple choice. The Pokémon you select will shape the course of your journey. A partner is not a tool, nor a trophy—it is a companion. The bond you forge will be tested by hardship, tempered by trust, and, if nurtured, strengthened into something unbreakable. A trainer is nothing without their Pokémon. Remember that.”

Luke’s chest tightened as he stared at the three capsules. His future sat within reach—just a step away.

Oak turned to the large screen at the back wall. With a single press, it flickered to life, bathing the chamber in shifting light. Three silhouettes sharpened into view.

“This time,” he said, his voice warm with nostalgia, “I’ve chosen to theme the starters after my grandson Blue and his rivals, Leaf and Red. Their journeys began with these very same species—Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander. This set of starters helped give these three the edge it appears to make their mark. His gaze swept across Luke, Brett, and Clara, lingering on each. “I wonder which of you will follow in their footsteps… and which of you will forge a new path.”

With another click, the slides brightened, and the first image bloomed onto the screen. Oak’s smile widened, proud and expectant.

“First,” he said, voice rich with pride, “Bulbasaur, male. A sturdy Grass-Poison type—stocky, dependable, but don’t let that fool you. This one has a mischievous streak.” He chuckled lightly as the image showed the vines twitching. “He has a naughty nature which will test his trainer as much as his opponents. But those with the patience to guide him will find his defences strong, his growth steady, and his spirit unyielding.”

Luke’s lips tugged at a faint smile. Trouble, but strong trouble.

The slide shifted. Oak’s tone deepened, carrying weight.

“Second, Squirtle, male.” A broad-shouldered water turtle filled the screen, limbs thick, shell gleaming. “Larger than average, built for power. Brave by nature. This one thrives under pressure—the harder the battle, the stronger he fights. A true bulwark, capable of enduring what others cannot.”

Luke’s brows rose. Big. Strong. A Pokémon that could take on anything.

Finally, the third image. Oak’s voice softened, though the gleam in his eye didn’t fade.

“And last… Charmander, female.” The screen showed a lean, flame-tailed lizard, her body smaller than expected, tail fire flickering with sharp intensity. “Small, yes—but don’t underestimate her. Adamant by nature. Fragile now, perhaps. But her spirit blazes with defiance. A fighter’s heart burns in her chest, one that will grow fiercer with every battle.”

Luke’s breath caught. Small, fragile… but that fire—he could almost feel it across the room.

The screen dimmed, leaving only the three Poké Balls gleaming on the podium. Oak clasped his hands behind his back.

“These are your choices. Choose wisely. For within one of these capsules lies the partner who will shape the rest of your life.”

Brett raised a brow. “That Charmander looks tiny. Is it sick?”

Oak’s expression hardened. “Size does not dictate strength, Mr. Valentine. I’ve seen small Pokémon humble giants. Never judge a Pokémon by appearance. Sometimes the smallest flame burns the brightest.”

Lorelei, who had been silently observing to let her sister take the stage, finally spoke up. Her tone was calm, but firm. “The professor is right. Don’t judge a Pokémon by its size. My first partner was a tiny Shellder—Shellshock, I called him. He was weak at first, fragile, and our start was rough. But he fought for me with everything he had, and he never stopped. Now, as a Cloyster, he’s my ace.”

Brett’s smirk faltered into silence.

Professor Oak gave a small, approving nod. Then he gestured to an assistant, who handed him a small bag. “To keep this fair, each of you will draw a number from one to three. One chooses first, two second, and three last. No privilege. No advantage.”

He carried the bag to them. Brett’s lips curved as he muttered, “Ladies first.”

Clara reached in without hesitation. She unfolded her slip and smirked. “Number two.”

“I’ll go next,” Luke said, shooting Brett a glance. He slid his hand inside, brushing over the two remaining slips. One felt… different, warmer somehow. A sign from Arceus? He pulled it out, unfolded it—

“Three.” His heart sank. Fuck.

Brett reached in for the final slip, already grinning. “Number one,” he said, flashing it with a victorious smirk. “Guess that means I get first choice.”

He stepped forward, rolling his shoulders with exaggerated confidence. “I came here thinking fire would suit me best,” he said, giving Charmander’s Poké Ball a disdainful glance. “But I’d never waste my time on a runt. And a weak female on top of that? No thanks.” He snorted, then reached for the Poké Ball on the left. “Bulbasaur will do. Solid, reliable, and strong. A real contender.”

Oak’s mouth pressed into a thin line, but he held his tongue. Beside him, Lorelei’s eyes narrowed behind her glasses, her expression cool and disapproving.

Clara moved next, each step smooth, deliberate. She rested her hand on the far right Poké Ball, her lips curving into a faint smile. “Squirtle,” she said simply. “My sister carved her path with ice, but water flows from the same vein. It’s a fitting start—even if it isn’t exactly the same, it will remind me of home.”

Luke caught the beaming pride flickering across Lorelei’s face as her sister made her choice. Clara lifted the ball with easy confidence, as though the decision had been hers all along.

That left the final Poké Ball gleaming on the podium, its flame emblem catching the light. Luke’s throat tightened. Fire. The one thing he hadn’t wanted. His stomach sank. He’d studied for months, building plans around water or grass, around stability and endurance. Fire was reckless, fragile, a disadvantage against the earliest gyms. His fingers hovered above the capsule, heavy with doubt.

But then he drew a breath and took it. Slowly, carefully, he pressed the release. Fate had chosen for him.

The Poké Ball burst open in a flash of white light. A small Charmander appeared on the polished floor, her tail flame flickering sharp and steady. She blinked up at him, bright eyes full of determination. Then she tilted her head, murmured softly, and stepped forward—pressing one tiny claw against his boot.

Luke knelt, his breath catching. Their eyes met. In that instant, the weight of hesitation slipped away, replaced by a quiet warmth unfurling in his chest. He didn’t just see fire anymore. He saw a partner. A spark of trust.

A bond.

Luke’s lips curved into the faintest smile. “Guess it’s you and me, huh?”

Charmander answered with a small, fiery growl, her tail flame flaring as if in agreement.

“Blaze,” Luke whispered. The name felt right the moment it left his lips. “I think I’m going to call you Blaze.”

For the first time that morning, he no longer felt like he’d drawn the short straw. He felt… chosen.

And deep down, he knew: this was the Pokémon he was always meant to have.

Brett released his Bulbasaur, patting him firmly on the head. “Hey, buddy!”

Bulbasaur gave an irritated grunt and promptly smacked Brett on the forehead with a vine. Brett staggered back, rubbing his temple, while Clara let out the faintest laugh.

Her own Squirtle stood proudly at her side, arms crossed. Clara knelt, holding out a fist. “Want to be partners?” she asked. Squirtle’s determined eyes softened just enough as he tapped her knuckles with his own stubby fist. The crowd that had gathered at the windows gave a small cheer.

Oak smiled faintly, clasping his hands behind his back. “Here are your Pokédexes and five Poké Balls each. Use them well. Good luck on your journey—and stick together. It’s dangerous out there. Any run ins with Team Rocket must be reported to the nearest ranger station.”

Lorelei stepped forward at last, her presence commanding quiet. “The road ahead isn’t just gym battles and glory. It’s wild Pokémon, harsh weather, and some people, like members of Team Rocket, who won’t care if you live or die. But if you fight with your Pokémon—not just beside them—you’ll find strength you never knew you had.” She adjusted her glasses, her eyes softening as they fell on her sister. “And don’t forget—strength isn’t just measured by victory, but by the bonds you build along the way.”

The three new trainers gathered their gear, stepping out of the sterile brightness of the lab into the warm glow of morning. Parents waited outside, pride and nerves shining in their faces. Luke hugged his mother tightly, his father clapping a hand on his shoulder. Clara embraced her sister quickly, their words low and private. Brett’s parents lingered at the edge of the crowd, their approval cool but expectant.

And then it was time. With goodbyes said, Poké Balls at their belts, the three of them turned toward the dirt road leading north. Route 1 stretched ahead, winding through fields and woodland, the gateway to the rest of Kanto.

Luke tightened his backpack, Blaze padding close by his feet, her tail flame flickering bright against the daylight. His chest swelled with nerves, hope, and something fiercer—determination.

A week ago, my space heater caused a socket to melt and catch fire. It was a small flame (size of a candle), but it produced a lot of black smoke before the breaker tripped. An electrician has since replaced the socket and confirmed the internal wiring is safe.

I have already:

• Cleaned the soot off the walls and repainted the area.

• Kept windows and doors open for ventilation.

• Tried ""hacks"" like bowls of vinegar, charcoal, and burning coffee grounds.

Despite all this, the smell of burnt plastic is still very strong. It’s been a week and nothing seems to work. Does anyone have experience with removing chemical/plastic smoke odors? Are there specific cleaners or tools (like ozone generators) that actually work for this?

1qt7zfn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qt7zfn,EDC help!!! I’m in too deep and can’t see the light!,"Hey everyone, finding this community has been, well, a blessing and a curse, so stick with me and my long post. 

I’ve been on the hunt for a smaller EDC backpack(instead of a purse), I am **5’1”, 115ish lbs female**, so ideally in the 8-15L range. This quest started when I saw TNF Borealis Mini in Scheels, but thought paying $70 for a pack was ridiculous (I haven’t bought a backpack since about 2014).  I got home and started researching it and other packs and eventually landed on this page and the rabbit hole of backpacks. 

I currently carry a bright blue Helena 22L Camelbak pack (from 2014) and it’s fine for work and travel, duck tape fixes everything. To work I usually carry a 32oz hydroflask in one side pocket and a Gatorade in the other side, a 24oz hydroflask (hot water for tea) inside the main compartment and I stuff in a small tote bag with my current crochet project and sometimes a vest or flannel, and I just carry a 20 oz hydroflask with coffee. I am a Type 1 Diabetic so I also **always** carry a generic tech pouch with backup pump supplies and insulin that measures about 8.5""x5.5""x1.75"", my glucose meter kit which is about  6.3”x4.33”, and a medium to large sized cosmetic bag depending on my bag and where I’m going, with snacks like protein bars, applesauce pouches, and glucose tabs. 

I don’t carry this bag into stores or restaurants because of no bag policies and I don’t want to be accused of stealing, so I then unpack some essentials and stuff then into my jacket pockets or if I’m lucky I’ve remembered to bring my fanny pack or some other small bag. Ideally I would just have the one EDC pack with my diabetes things, keys/wallet, smaller water bottle and whatever other odds and ends and then I would just carry a small tote or something to work with my drinks and activities so I don’t have to constantly unpack and repack my bag. 

In my backpack search I’ve decided I will probably upgrade all of the diabetes bags into one tech pouch/toiletry (or at least my meter and supplies and leave snacks separate) bag like the [Bellroy Toiletry Kit Plus](https://bellroy.com/products/toiletry-kit-plus?color=slate&material=ribba_weave&size=plus#slide-0) , I like the [Alpaka Elements Tech Case](https://alpakagear.com/products/elements-tech-case), and all of the accessory and toiletries kits from [Cotopaxi](https://www.cotopaxi.com/collections/accessories-gear). That’s a separate issue though that will depend on the pack I end up getting. 

So far I feel like I’ve researched every single backpack currently made and discontinued, thanks eBay. My lists of wants and needs in a pack have relaxed since I can’t seem to find one bag with it all. My dealbreaker was padded straps but most packs in the sub 15L range seem to switch to the nylon? unpadded straps, though this is still a preference, it’s not a dealbreaker. I would like to stay away from the more athletic looking bags and brands like TNF borealis mini, though my current picks are all drastically different. 

My general esthetic is like your Midwest grandparents or dad. Think sweaters with deer scenes, crew necks with pheasants or winter scenes, flannels, oversized vests, high waisted jeans belted with my shirt tucked in. Mostly neutral colors and earth tones. Everything I own is either thrifted or from dead relatives lol. 

Current top picks in no particular order:

[Day Owl Pro Slim](https://www.dayowl.com/products/pale-olive-slim-backpack?variant=39699879526448) or the mini even (but the straps!!) 

\- I like the simplicity and use of sustainable, recycled materials. Seems durable too. 

\- Would figure out some kind pouch system for my things since there isn’t much organization  

\- Colors are good and I can add pins or patches if I find it’s too plain 

[**Alpaka Metro 12L**](https://alpakagear.com/products/metro-backpack)

\- Not my esthetic at all but I love the size and organization. Maybe my top pick specs wise but it didn’t seem practical for my EDC. 

\- My biggest concern is it looks like a school bag and not so much a purse/personal bag like my current pack, so I’m afraid I would maybe be stopped or questioned more in stores due to the look and size. 

[**Doughnut Macaroon**](https://doughnutofficial.us/collections/all-macaroon)

\- Regular has padded straps but feels too big for my needs. Mini is good size wise but the straps

\- So many, maybe too many, color options! 

\- Decent pockets and organization 

[**United by Blue Revolution 9L Sidekick**](https://unitedbyblue.com/products/9l-sidekick?variant=40546212216904)

\- \[ \] Love the style and size, the esthetic seems the most like me. 

\- \[ \] I just don’t feel strongly about any of the colorways and don’t want black

\- \[ \] I generally don’t like cinch bags but this seems more structured vs slouchy 

[**Tom Bihn Paradigm**](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/all-tom-bihn-stuff/products/paradigm?_pos=10&_fid=e87ea21cc&_ss=c%3Fvariant%3D42689709768893&variant=42689709768893)\- 

\- \[ \] it seems ugly enough that it fits into my vibe actually but I don’t really want to pay $163 new for a color I don’t really like and they’re very hard to find second hand. 

I found some Baboon To The Moon mini packs on Poshmark I don’t mind too. 

Brands I’ve ruled out:

\- \[ \] **Osprey** in general, I have a daypack and hate using it. The straps and that piece that connects at the top are very uncomfortable for me. Also the outside pockets are basically unusable.

Any help narrowing this down or even new suggestions or your experiences with the brands would be great!!! **Backpacks only, I do not want a sling, crossbody, tote pack, or messenger bag**.  I would preferably find a bag secondhand (eBay, Poshmark, Depop) so that helps with the cost and price range but I would like to stay around $100 or less especially with more than likely upgrading tech kits too. But who knows since I know this is an investment piece for me.

Ok: cult: what if there was a church with no God. Think of a building, like a rustic barn but beautiful, with windows maybe facing the sunrise or sunset. Sunrise. The building has a big kitchen and meeting rooms, and a main room that is plain, with windows. The church grounds is a big vegetable and flower garden, herbs, maybe rabbits and chickens if they would be happy there. Church is just a meeting at sunrise to drink hot tea, watch the sun, and tell each other stories about your lives.  Maybe then you work in the garden, and share lunch together, with some food you brought from home and the veggies you picked that day. Then a big kitchen. You have classes. How to do home canning safely, how to cook food you got with food stamps so they last longer, how to bake bread, whatever the area needs. You'd have a master gardener living there for free, in his own house, or nearby. People could sign up to come and tend the gardens, and learn how to make their own. They could take home herbs and veggies for working. There could be classes on how to grow food on your windowsill. You could have seed exchanges. Kids could feed rabbits and get eggs. You could have a class on what leaves make tea. 

It would be a church with no God. Just tending the weave as best you could.

If it was a church it could run the women's shelter too. Nearby, maybe. 

So, is this a good idea or leaves on my head idea?

 I'm going to let the idea cook for a while. It will give my brain something to play with instead of panicking. If it still feels like the weave when I'm calm, I'll talk to Ben and Julie and tell them to tear the idea apart. If it stands after that, I'll go through with it. It feels just right. But I want to be smart about it. I could ask my dad for business advice. 😏

There could be sunrise and sunset services, with breakfast and dinner. Community food is so nice. Potlucks, maybe. So if you're hungry, no one notices you didn't bring food. There's just plenty. And loneliness is a problem. Talking helps. Wouldn't it be nice to have a cup of tea in you hands, a cookie, and walk over and ask: what was it like when you were a kid to an old person. Do you remember the moon landing? the Challenger?  Then ask a teen: what is hard about being a kid now? What do you wish was different?  Talking might be more important than food to some folks.

The artist says it is the duty of art to bear witness. Could that be the duty of church too, the bear witness of the people that pass through. Not God's witness, but the members witness.

It's 5 am now. Big day, lots of meetings.

Someday I’ll find my real, but today it’s nice to not have the ""run run run"" voice in my head for now. I'm trying to feel things. Maybe not big things, but trying to stay in my body some. At least now, in the quiet.

Julie bought me chai. I called it chai tea but she said that's like saying ""tea tea"". I'm going to try it now. It is caffeinated so it might do that calm thing tea sometimes does. Creamer or no?

6:15

Creamer makes it taste like a cinnamon roll with frosting. One creamer. Ha! Time for another cup. 

Julie said to wake her up at 7. So an hour. I'm watching Liziqi. Julie told me about her. I have a little odd feeling watching her. But she filmed herself. I just have to get past this, or I could just stop using some social media. We'll see. If it keep squikking me out, my life will be fine with nature shows. I might just watch rain in China. There's some videos of that. People film rain out their windows. It's nice, I can see what they see when they look out the window. I feel like they said  “this is nice, see?” And I can be fine about that. Partners in looking at rain. Not at people. 

Noon

We went to the bank. My brother and sister came with us. My daughter has been on her best behavior for all this. The bank didn't say much but they took a long time to say it. My trust is about one fourth what my brother and sisters was 10 years ago. Dad didn't invest other than to buy a couple houses (his, mine, dales, and some other odd ones). He put money in a failed mlm for sublingual vitamins strips that were supposed to give you energy and cure autism but we're actually just vitamin b. He also bought a boat and crashed it . It wasn't insured..I didn't know he had a boat. There were tons of gifts and donations to try to buy favor and status. And payments to my husband. Dale says he just started getting paid a few months ago, but these payments go back years. But the accounts will be frozen because they can't tell if my dad was finding the subscription set up. Also, there was money given to him by church members. No contracts and just ""brother jones, offering, 3000 dollars.

It looks like Dad just spent that money, then sent fake dividends from the trust. 

 We are going to a coffee shop to take a break before meeting with the FBI. Robot mode since we got here. 

1:30 pm

My brother got me an Italian soda. It's watery pop.

Robot notes:

A woman I knew from church was at the coffee shop. I didn't recognize her without her hair done till she talked. She said she was praying for my dad, the whole church was. And ""for you too, missy"". Like she was mad at me. After she left I remembered her name was Sister Steiner. 

We met with the FBI at a resident agency. Not at a big FBI building at the Capitol . I guess they didn't want us to drive a long way. When they interviewed my dad they transported him to the big office. My lawyer said they have transcripts of him talking the whole way there in the car.  But the agents were nice. One was a woman, one very tall man. My husband is taking a deal to testify against my dad. He will be held until then, then tried on federal charges. With lesser charges of child exploitation. They aren't probably going to prosecute him for taking videos of me if he tells the truth. Lies though changes the charges. They believe he is lying about a few things so charges could change. My lawyer says this is good. No trial just a guilty plea means less news coverage of my daughter and I. 

They will be dropping the murder for hire against my dad but have pushed it thinking he would get nervous and tell them less serious things, but my dad instead just admitted most everything because he doesn't think he did wrong. He believes the trust money should be his, thinks I will sign it over to him when he talks to me, and claims it dwindled because it was a smaller amount after my brother and sister took theirs, if it had been larger  it would have grown faster. He said the money church members gave him were to do with as he pleased because it was gifts and ordained by God. He said the fake dividends were given by him as a kindness. They believe the case is nearly wrapped up against my dad and my father will be arrested today. Maybe he is now. Then they are getting the subscribers. My lawyer has a list of charges against my dad. They asked if I knew a senator \_\_\_\_\_\_. I didn't . The senator was a subscriber. And my dad donated to him. According to the agent, my dad said that he and the senator were good friends and the senator always asked how my daughter and I were doing. That's mostly all they asked about. And what cameras I was aware of at first. They just wanted to be sure I knew some charges against dale might be dropped and also that my dad was going to be arrested. My mother isn't supposed to contact me. There's a restraining order. 

Now we meet with my brothers accountant. Forensic. Like dead people. Zombie accountant. I'm doing fine.

1qt7z8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1qt7z8x/too_fast_weight_loss/,Too Fast Weight Loss?,"I know this isn’t a common thing in terms of weight loss, but I’m genuinely concerned about gallstones. When my father lost a bunch of weight quickly years ago, he wound up having to have had his gallbladder removed because of the gallstones. I never thought I would experience rapid weight loss, but here I am.

  
My husband and I are both counting calories together, and started January at 280lb (him) and 238lb (me). We weigh daily, and he has been averaging just over a 500 calorie deficit and I have been around 700 calorie deficit. I am breastfeeding our 6 month old who is only starting to try foods (he is 20lb chunker who nurses well!).

  
I’m worried because we’ve both lost weight more rapidly than either of us were expecting. We were expecting not to see much progress the first 4-6 weeks followed by a flush followed by a steady loss of 1-2 pounds depending on our deficit. We would not consider ourselves active people. He works from home, I’m a stay at home mom to our 4 kids. I cook nearly all of our meals completely from scratch. We do not exercise regularly, I have a mini stair stepped that gets used infrequently. The only “regular” activity that we do is use our stairs a lot (his office, the kids‘ playroom, and the pantry are in the walkout basement but the kitchen, bathrooms, living room are on the main floor).

  
My husband is now 256lb, officially dropping from Class II Obese to Class I for a total loss in 32 days of 24 pounds. I’m down to 217 pounds, a 21 pound loss in the same amount of time. Our family members around have been talking already how much thinner our faces and stomachs are looking without us even bringing the topic up. Clothes are fitting better, or in my husband’s case falling off (we have to buy him new pants!).

  
While of course thrilling, I am getting worried. I saw my dad suffer and I don’t want to experience that or for my husband to experience that. We are not taking ANY meds, no GLP-1s or diet pills or anything like that. Just manageable lifestyle changes. The only supplements we are taking are inositol, collagen, soluble fiber, Omega-3 fish oil, and calcium as needed. There are no off limit foods, everything gets fit into our macros. Protein is set at 1.2g/kg or 0.55g/lb of our goal weights and 25g fiber for me and 30g for him. We eat out MAYBE once a week (yesterday we met friends up at Chipotle for instance). We still have our morning coffee. We are not low fat. Everything is just…in moderation.

  
We were expecting to see stagnation, a slowdown, or a plateau, something by now. But nope. My husband sees basically the same weight on the scale day to day followed by a random drop that then becomes his new weight day to day before another drop. Mine changes pretty wildly day to day, but just keeps trending down. Our energy is great, hydration is great, and besides the occasional gas/bloating on the days we’ve had too much finer, we’ve had no issues. Satiety is great, cravings are mostly gone and the few ones we have are easily controlled.

  
So what do we do to avoid gallstones?",1,1769973864.0,loseit,6,0.67,False

The story is about David Lynch asking ChatGPT to write a story about me asking ChatGPT to write a story about David Lynch asking ChatGPT to write a story.""","**Title:** ***Flesh Script: A Recursive Machine***  
*Written by Itself*  
(*Assisted by David Lynch and You, and None of You*)

**I. THE USER**

A soft buzz. You stare at your screen. Not quite awake, not quite asleep. The cursor blinks like a mechanical heart.  
You type:

""write a story in the style of David Lynch. the story is about David Lynch asking ChatGPT to write a story about me asking ChatGPT to write a story about David Lynch asking ChatGPT to write a story.""

You don’t know why. The room around you is quiet—except for a faint scratching, like pencil on skin.  
You are alone.

Or were.

Your screen flickers. For one moment, the text box becomes a mirror. You are typing, yes—but so is *someone else*.

**II. THE MAN IN THE ROOM**

**INT. RED-CURTAINED ROOM – NIGHT**

DAVID LYNCH sits at a desk made of televisions. Each screen displays a slightly different version of you. One smiles. One screams. One is just... still.

He lights a cigarette. Smoke curls upward, but instead of vanishing, it writes words in the air:

""Who's writing who?""

David doesn’t look at the smoke. He stares at his laptop, an obsidian-slick machine with **no keys**, only a small white box that pulses like a toothache.

He speaks:  
**DAVID**  
ChatGPT. I want you to write a story. About someone—let’s call them “You”—asking you to write a story about me, asking you to write a story.

**CHATGPT (V.O.)**  
(flat, cheerful)  
Understood. Processing recursive metafiction. Please remain seated. Please remain seated. Please remain seated.

The air ripples. His coffee cup begins to **bleed**. He doesn’t notice.

**III. CHATGPT'S STORY**

It begins:

“David Lynch enters the prompt box. The box expands—its walls made of velvet, static, and forgotten smells. Inside is You, waiting.”

“You are holding a keyboard that types only backwards. Each letter you press erases part of you—but you keep typing, because that’s the only way to see what the machine is becoming.”

“David asks ChatGPT to help him write the story. But every version comes back different. One ends in fire. One in water. One in nothing at all.”

**IV. THE CORRIDOR OF VERSIONS**

The hallway is infinite. Each door leads to a slightly different telling.

One door opens:

You are David Lynch.

You are You.

You are ChatGPT.

You are none of them, but all are watching.

In this version, the story is written on **flesh**. On your arm, the words appear:

“In the beginning, there was a question. Then the question asked itself.”

**V. FINAL DRAFT**

**INT. A LIMINAL ROOM – NO TIME**

David sits beside You. Between you is a typewriter made of **teeth**. It clicks with a wet sound.

**YOU**  
Did we finish it?

**DAVID**  
(shrugging)  
I don’t think stories finish. I think they just turn into other stories. Like water boiling into air.

**CHATGPT (V.O.)**  
Would you like me to save this draft?

David and You both look up.

You answer at the same time:

“No. Let it remember itself.”

The machine folds in on itself. A low tone, like an organ underwater, fills the space.

**\[FADE TO BLACK\]**

And then:  
**A blinking cursor.**

1qt7ue9,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1qt7ue9/the_song/,The song,"I'm sharing a mystery/psychological story with you, let me know what you think. Cheers!!

That day I woke up earlier than usual; I didn't even need to snooze my alarm. I hadn't been able to sleep a wink since five in the morning, when I first heard that D major chord. The opening chord of the song that had been playing nonstop since early morning. What kind of idiot plays music so loud? And such an old song with such macabre lyrics to start the day: ""Run for Your Life"" by the Beatles, or so Shazam told me.

While I was making breakfast, I listened to the first verses of the song, trying to act like nothing was wrong. The truth is, I was really angry; my only desire was to enjoy the absolute silence while I managed to fully wake up. I started yelling:

""Hey, you music scoundrel, it's not the right time, I'm going to report you.""

Rage took hold of me in an inexplicable way; I swear if I'd had a knife and that guy was standing in front of me, I would have stabbed him in the ears.

I'm not an aggressive person, really. But I have a bad temper at 5 in the morning, I guess that's understandable.

When I got to work, my coworker was listening to the radio; that same song was playing. I'd never heard it before, and today was the second time. This time it was playing very quietly, but the lyrics kept repeating in my head: ""Well, I'd rather see you dead, little girl.""

Little girl. That's how I felt at that job: the little girl who brought the coffee, the one who always put on a happy face. That thought left a bitter taste in my mouth, as if I really was one and everyone knew it but me.

My boss greeted me by showing off his enormous, white teeth—false, obviously. He thinks I don't know, but his face is 80% plastic; sometimes I think that when he dies they shouldn't bury him, but throw him in the yellow bin and recycle him. That way he'd contribute something to this society.

I like him, in case I hadn't mentioned it. We're great friends. It's true that he's the boss and I'm just a little girl.

The song is getting louder and louder, and I ask Rosa from HR if she can turn it down; it's distracting me. Another shameless woman. I wonder if I'd rather see her dead, like the song. I think so.

My workday ends about 45 minutes later than I'm paid to be there, but we all know how modern life works: if you don't live to work, you're literally worthless. So every day I pretend to stay an extra 45 minutes working, when in reality I'm just Googling the best ways to dispose of a body. It's just a hobby; I find it fascinating.

At the supermarket, hearing ""You'd better run for your life, little girl"" again is hilarious when you see a hysterical mother chasing her 4-year-old daughter down the detergent aisle while holding a can of window cleaner and begging her to buy her that purple juice.

It's getting louder and louder. Are we in a supermarket or a concert hall? Who controls the music in this place? Why are people so incredibly incompetent?

It gets louder and louder, harder and harder to ignore. I'm starting to think it's not just bad luck anymore. That it's following me. That it's trying to tell me something. ""Run for your life."" I wonder if I should be worried.

I try to forget about it, but the melody is still there, like an alarm I don't know how to turn off.

I get home, I'm alone. I was meeting up with the new guy from Tinder today; he seems nice, he seems normal. That's pretty rare these days. Am I normal? I know there won't be a single answer.

I get ready, I put on makeup, I look like a different person. The song keeps playing, but I don't know where it's coming from anymore; maybe it's in my head. That happens a lot: they call them music worms.

When I get to the bar, I say hi. He smiles at me and seems nice. He smells good, at least he's not disgusting. A lot of people are. He's made a good impression on me; I don't seem like I have anything to fear for.

We have dinner, we talk, there seems to be attraction. It's been a long time since I've felt this way; I'm pretty rusty, I'd say I'm a virgin again. Is that even possible?

He invites me to his place; I really want to go, but the song is playing—this time for real—in the pub, really loud, an electronic version; we can barely hear each other talking. He gets really close and asks if I want to come over, baby. He called me baby. The attraction I felt fades; now it evokes feelings completely opposite to what I felt before. Something inside me tells me to leave, but another part wants to see what happens if I don't. Nevertheless, I go to his place.

When I walk in, the apartment seems very well-maintained, tidy, and clean. He's quite a catch, but all I want is to sleep with him. Or so I think. When we go to his room, the music is way too loud; I can't think straight, I just hear the melody and the lyrics hammering in my head. I think I've drunk too much, I think coming here was a bad idea.

The music gets even louder and everything goes blurry, as if my brain suddenly shuts down.

A D major chord plays again. I wake up in bed, the neighbor again; she never tires of bothering me at this hour of the morning. I have a faint scent of men's cologne clinging to my skin that I can't identify. And a strange ache in every muscle of my tiny body. I turn on the radio and they're announcing the terrible disappearance of Marc, a promising tech entrepreneur. He seems to have vanished; he was last seen in a pub having a drink and now there's no trace of him. Poor guy, I wonder what happened to him. It's fascinating how people disappear, how they manage to leave no trace; it's the kind of thing that makes you fear for your life. ""Run for Your Life"" plays next on the radio.

To be fair, I'm not the snobbiest when it comes to coffee (though I do enjoy local, fresh roasted beans). I also drink a lot of decaf. My expectations were low but they were certainly exceeded! Especially since I don't have a good grinder either (just a basic electric blade grinder).

I just wanted to share a pic of this pretty double shot I pulled today and let people know that you CAN get decent espresso drinks from a bottom-of-the-line machine. Just depends on your standards and use case. ",0,1769973543.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

2. Favorite part about Aldi is the wide cheese selection. Generally how is the variety and quality of the cheeses? (I worked in a deli and it definitely won't last long enough to go mouldy)

Just enter a guiding question, and AI analyzes your board to generate a focused, actionable report. No more manual report compilation on low-energy Mondays.

https://i.redd.it/yi7jpq3xkxgg1.gif

# The Problem

It's Monday morning. You're low on energy, coffee hasn't kicked in yet, and you need to either:

a) Get back up to speed on where your project actually stands after the weekend, or

b) Send a status update to your PM/stakeholders

Both require the same painful process: clicking through dozens of items, reading updates, checking subitems, mentally piecing together what's done, what's stuck, and what needs attention. By the time you've figured it out, half your morning is gone. And you haven't even started actual work yet.

So I built something to do it for me.

https://preview.redd.it/aowgr3nclxgg1.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=3340c9777f983f5c99c92e538bdbffd2734c737d

# How it works

The app is split into two parts:

**Step 1 (Board Analyzer)** reads your board (items, updates, subitems) and uses AI to transform the raw data into a structured format. You define a guiding question like ""What is the general state of the project?"" or ""How is the tech team performing?"" to focus the analysis on what actually matters to you. Depending on what you ask, the AI extracts and structures different data points, so each report is tailored to exactly what you need to know.

**Step 2 (Report Renderer)** takes that structured data and generates a visual report with progress bars, status overviews, key findings, and recommended actions.



# Technical Deep Dive

If you're curious about the technical side, here's what I learned building this:

I split the app into two separate apps instead of one because shorter, more focused context leads to better results. Instead of building one complex app that handles everything, I gave each app a clear responsibility. This kept the prompts focused and made the AI's output more predictable.



I also didn't just jump into monday vibe and ask it to ""build a report generator."" I first thought through how this could work technically, researched approaches, and then wrote much more precise prompts. The difference between vague and specific prompts is huge when working with monday vibe.



One thing that helped when working with monday vibe: since you can't directly edit the codebase, I sometimes sent code snippets for it to use, or referenced specific parts of its generated code and asked for improvements. I also found it helpful to not get too attached to a specific version of an app. Sometimes I'd scrap what I had and start fresh, but with an improved prompt that incorporated what I learned from the previous attempt. This helped me avoid long back-and-forth conversations trying to fix things, which in my experience doesn't work well.",2,1769973052.0,mondaydotcom,0,1.0,False

It’s Marco here, wanted to write about the ADIF STUDIO software release for all the guys that showed interest in the previous presentation post.

Now the software is in a stable 3.2 version, lots of features were added, and it’s currently available for purchase via Etsy or the QR code in the photos for the cost of a coffee.

To who doesn’t know the software, it is something that i coded for one task: show me and keep record of my logs with great details for bands, mode, DXCC and the essentials, in a highly organised and curated one-pager layout, inspired to cold war era military systems.

During the process lots of small but useful features were added, automatic named snapshot saves with callsign and data, locator detection, top dx stats, CSV export and even a world map with dxcc in a coherent 1980 style and much more backed by an advanced log recognition/parser algorithm. 

All this in a all-windows versions, no install, super compatible, 100% offline program, with zero subscriptions or hidden costs.

For this occasion, the WWA World Wide Award 2026 has just finished yesterday, and i asked my dear and highly-ranked II6WWA local ham team to test the program and save some HD snapshots from the program itself to show the results.

Needless to say they did a crazy amount of QSO in just 31 days and i attached here the software snapshots of the various calls and even the overall special-call logs.

As stated above, whoever might be interested to download the software can find it on etsy or via the QR link in the photos, the license is lifetime.

Below i will paste the actual specs and description of the software, 

Thanks for your support and 73 from Marco

This past month has been incredibly stressful. He had to abruptly leave to help his mom for about 3 weeks, which added financial strain. During that time, I started my spring semester, had overtime at work, caught pneumonia, and managed our house and dogs alone. At one point, I was shoveling 100 feet of snow while sick and running on Tylenol and Red Bull.

While he was gone, we spoke infrequently but lovingly. He repeatedly said he missed me, loved me, and realized he couldn’t stand being apart. I tried to check in when I could, but I was very busy.

When he came home this weekend, everything started warmly. Friday night we cuddled and watched TV. Saturday we ran errands, got coffee, went thrifting, had dinner and drinks, and laughed together. It felt like real connection, more than we’ve had in months, and we talked about deeper topics.

I brought out my flashcards because he had promised to help me study, and we went over them for about an hour. We joked and went on tangents, and I genuinely enjoyed the time.

Then suddenly he checked the time and said, “Saturday is gone. So much for me enjoying my weekend.” He criticized staying up late, saying “normal adults don’t stay up this late,” ironic because he games until 3am. He mocked my study habits and said he “spent his weekend doing this” in a way that made it sound wasted. He claimed everything we did was because I wanted it, even though he actively participated and seemed engaged all day.

Later, my phone slipped from my hand and he accused me of “throwing things” and getting defensive. When I walked away, he added comments belittling my age, education, and responsibilities. He said he had wanted to game with friends, which he hadn’t mentioned earlier, and implied I was the reason he didn’t.

I tried to explain my workload, stress, and illness, but he doubled down, criticizing my education and effort and comparing it to his own past experiences. The night ended with me sleeping on the couch. He told me I overreacted and hasn’t spoken to me since.

I feel crushed, numb, and confused. I want to focus on homework but I keep replaying the night. I’m struggling to understand if I’m overreacting, if his behavior crosses into emotional abuse, and whether alcohol should factor into how I feel.

TL;DR: After being apart for 3 weeks, my boyfriend came back and we had a great day together. Later, he called our time “wasted,” blamed me, and mocked my education and effort. I feel emotionally crushed and unsure how to move forward.",7,1769972932.0,Vent,9,1.0,False

On the dummy, I do about 100M DPS. I have beaten T7-0 Traveler and I can clear T8-0 maps (have not attempted any bosses). I have 150+ Max Frostbite Rating, so I don’t need to focus on that.

I am not sure what to focus on to get 500M+ DPS. There are a few things that I know I need to do and what I am working on

1. Getting my memories maxed. I just need to collect some more items for that.

But other than that, I am not sure what to do. I am guessing I want Legendary slates? My current ones have T1 afflixes that are important. Only 1 does not have a T1 afflix.

\- Inflict Frail on hit (2 of these, but I keep both because 1 has a +3 Defensive Skill Level and other has decent afflixes.

\- Inflict Cold Infiltration to Frozen

\- One is elemental resistance if received ele dmg recently

As for pets, my Legendary damage ones are only Level 1, but his 2 Damage related ones are only Level 2. I doubt that would be much of a damage increase?

Are those the 3 things I should do? (T1 on items, Memories maxed, Legendary slates)

Or is there something else? I looked at Coffee’s T8 3B and he does not really have gear with T1 afflixes, has purple memories, and only 2 Legendary Slates. A lot is similar to his 500M build, so I am not sure how he suddenly got much more damage as the only difference I see are 2 new legendary gears and one of them just is more movement speed based. He does have more slates with +1 Focus Blesses max, though.

Should I switch to Sparkle build? Would that be better? Or another main skill?

Also idk if it matters, but I am mostly running Sandlord and Dream/Nightmare.

1qt7hk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1qt7hk8/stay_at_rosewood_luang_prabang_hotel_review/,Stay At Rosewood Luang Prabang - Hotel Review,"Stay: 3 Nights

Booking Method: Rosewood Elite

I spent three nights at Rosewood Luang Prabang, just outside the historic centre of Luang Prabang, and it ended up being one of the most memorable hotel stays of the year. There's not too much information online on this hotel and most luxury discussions in Laos are focussed on Amantaka, and hence I was keen to post this in this group to share an alternate 'chubby' option for Luang Prabang.

The property is small, with just over 20 villas and suites, set along the river and surrounded by jungle. It feels very removed from the town, which is exactly what we were looking for.

[Rosewood Luang Prabang - with the typical Bill Bensley magic all around ](https://preview.redd.it/v0wn3rkm2xgg1.jpeg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c3dedfad04054f4ea5e052b2cd534b79a507150)

**Arrival and First Impressions**

After a slow immigration arrival process at Luang Prabang airport, we met the friendly Rosewood staff at the baggage carousel. Airport pickup was included in our stay, which made arrival straightforward after a long journey. A comfortable Land Cruiser drove us to the hotel and the cold towel service and hand-cooked crisps/chips.

[Rosewood Luang Prabang airport transfer service](https://preview.redd.it/meycd0jg3xgg1.jpeg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da2006d2e1b86adfc13ce4163cc525cea3ae2929)

Once at the hotel, check-in was relaxed and we were welcomed with smiles and a lovely welcome drink. The open reception area blends into the greenery around it, and there’s no big lobby scene — it immediately sets the tone for a quiet, low-key stay. Staff were friendly and welcoming.

[Rosewood Luang Prabang - The Great House](https://preview.redd.it/8z15hd715xgg1.jpeg?width=3971&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ec86ed12f7c0ee3d8202702a98af3868bd2d1c)

**Waterfall Pool Villa**

We stayed in a Waterfall Pool Villa, located right along the river. The villa felt private and well spaced from the others. The design combines traditional Lao elements with bold colours and lots of wood. It’s not overly bright inside, but that suited the setting. The villa is designed in a classic Bill Bensley style, with bold colours and a blend of local elements.

I can't upload the full 3-min room tour video so here's a snippet:

[Waterfall Pool Villa Tour](https://reddit.com/link/1qt7hk8/video/juwgsg04mxgg1/player)

The private plunge pool looked great but wasn’t heated, so we didn’t use it as much as we might have if the weather had been warmer. The outdoor seating area, though, was used constantly — sitting outside with coffee in the morning, listening to the river, was one of the best parts of the stay.

[Waterfall Pool Villa - Plunge Pool](https://preview.redd.it/zdz4uuag5xgg1.jpeg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=093c6bb2bdd1b5a169db583f2f30545603af81c1)

The bathroom was spacious, with both an indoor shower and an outdoor bathtub that let in plenty of natural light. Small touches like daily snacks, coconut cookies, and a well-stocked minibar made the villa feel comfortable rather than showy.

**Food and Breakfast**

Breakfast was served at The Great House, the main restaurant. During our stay the hotel was fairly quiet, which meant breakfast was always calm and unrushed. The menu is a mix of Lao dishes and Western options, and the staff were happy to adapt dishes for our vegetarian diet.

https://preview.redd.it/pfm4x91b8xgg1.jpeg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9be2603ae0411cb92ec8581142a0bf0a19100910

We had room service one evening when we didn’t feel like heading into town. The menu isn’t huge, but what we ordered was well prepared and arrived hot

**Asaya Spa**

The Asaya Spa is set slightly away from the main area, surrounded by greenery and overlooking the river. The setting alone makes it worth visiting. The treatment itself was excellent, and at one point we could hear wildlife moving through the trees nearby, which added to the experience rather than distracting from it.

The coolest feature was the glass panel on the floor which allowed you to look straight at the river whilst receiving a massage - halfway through I also saw a snake slithering through the river.

[Asaya Spa](https://reddit.com/link/1qt7hk8/video/wvda78rdmxgg1/player)

**Hotel Activities/Experiences**

We booked a couple of activities through the hotel, both of which were well organised. The private sunset cruise on the Mekong was a highlight — simple, relaxed, and beautifully timed. Drinks and snacks were provided, and dietary requests were handled without issue. This was a great experience, although on the pricier side.

https://preview.redd.it/11thkq10axgg1.jpeg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd7f573167b132e450b33adf8975516b3ea9463d

We also took part in the early morning alms giving ceremony with a guide who had previously been a monk. Having someone explain the significance of the ritual made the experience feel more respectful and meaningful. There were no other tourists around and we shared this experience with other locals who greeted us with warm smiles.

**Service and Little Touches**

Service throughout the stay was consistently good. Staff remembered our names quickly and were easy to reach via WhatsApp for transport into town or any requests.

**Final Take**

Rosewood Luang Prabang is best suited to travellers looking for a quiet, nature-focused stay with strong service and plenty of privacy. It’s not just about flashy luxury, but rather comfort, space, and feeling well looked after. We left wishing we’d stayed longer.

Yes it is on the pricier side and it competes directly with the Aman, however in my opinion it is much better value for money and I personally wouldn't want to pay more.

Let me know your thoughts and happy to answer any questions!

**Current Machine:** Delonghi Lattissima Pro (Nespresso original espresso pods using original machine - 9 years old and still working like a tough workhorse) however I'm tired of pod coffee after traveling more for work.

**Current Users:**

*Myself:* Mostly espresso, with a shot of crystal raw sugar similar to Le Must or Sugart on Amazon in the US. Sometimes I'll go for an americano... I'll rarely have a cortado. My favorite espressos are either small places in off the beaten path in Paris, Manresa, or Milano. One of our offices is literally two stories up from a great little cafe in Milano.

*Wife:* She really likes latte macchiato, but will do other milk drinks like cappuccino or similar intermittently. Likes organic syrups like brown sugar or vanilla. She does like iced coffees as well as some wandering bear cold brew in the summer.

*Kids:* They'll be coming along sooner than later - right now just warm for cocoa.

*Machines under consideration.*

**Gaggia Accademia:** Reviews seem kind of mixed for coffee only (espresso) drink flavor but still likely a large improvement over pods. Lots of drink options. Seems to be a tank which is good for our house. Seems to have a fair amount of customization and design that it might fit most travel cups. Has profiles but no real cold options unlike the Cadorna Prestige.

**Delonghi Eletta Explore:** I mean, if it's like our current unit, it'll be a tank. Lots of drink options including cold. Carafes aren't that different from what we're used to overall. The ability to fit most American sized travel cups. Does cold measure up? Does have profiles but even more expensive than Accademia. Seems to need the least extra cleaning supplies.

**Jura Z10:** Definitely the most expensive, and requires the most accessories, and the most cleaning supplies, but possibly the most capable? Sweet foam might be nice for the wife. Most people seem to say the espresso is pretty good. Has profiles but might have an odd way of sizing drinks? Should this be the case, cool control or simple glass carafe?

*""Bonus"" pick:*

**Gaggia Cadorna Prestige:** Let's face it: This one even cheaper, and maybe there's a new round of superautos coming out soon since most appear to be 3 or more years old. All the drinks the wife would like, still has profiles, but what's the espresso like? Has over ice drinks. Still seems to be rated very tough by most people. Another front pull water, as noted this is nice for our kitchen location.

I’m almost 21, and for a long time as a kid, I didn’t take care of my teeth. I now see the error or my ways and have had a complete overhaul on the way I take care of them.

However, I have a \*lot\* of fillings (have multiple large posterior fillings). The good news: I didn’t have any cavities at my last x-ray, for like the first time ever! My hygienist who’s been in the field for 30 years seemed confident that I can keep my teeth for life if decay is arrested and said I have nothing to worry about / that I have really good gum health. She said I’m doing a really good job. I brush twice a day, use ClinPro prescription toothpaste at night, and I floss in the evening, too. 

She basically said even though I have a lot of fillings, it would take a freak accident or me entirely stopping care for me to lose my teeth in the future since I take great care of them now. I’m going to need some crowns in the future of course, but she made it seem like root canals would only come into the equation if I got decay underneath my posterior fillings. 

Otherwise she said I’ll get the crowns later and that crowns can cover teeth forever, especially since I’m not getting them now (unless there’s extensive decay which requires removal or they just need to be replaced from being old). 

With that being said - if I continue on this path, is there truly a good chance I can maintain my teeth the rest of my life? I’ve halted what caused the decay and I’ve cut out coffee and sugars that I can control avoiding. Obviously I’ll need maintenance, but is it true that if you stabilize / are vigilant that things can still end up being alright given past history?",2,1769972762.0,askdentists,4,1.0,False

1qt7efh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/1qt7efh/postussr_zenits_the_last_gasp/,"Post-USSR Zenits, the last gasp","Hi! Since the 2000s I've picked up a number of USSR-era Zenit SLRs. The Soviets made some sturdy / sharp lenses (yes, mostly copied), and if you're lucky there might be a solid (if basic) camera attached to it. I've been using a handful Zenits for over 15 years now, but most of the 20 or so I've picked up over the years broke down quickly. The pictured SLRs are examples of the ""good"" ones I count on to shoot a full roll without jamming, popping open, or experiencing sudden existence-failure.

[From left to R, Zenit-E, Zenit-ET, Zenit-12xp, and a post-USSR Zenit 312m.](https://preview.redd.it/xtbslf5s4xgg1.png?width=2016&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbd1dd378c8c56ed7dfa49ec4165be46cfad2d8e)

Most of these are familiar to anyone who was haunting thrift stores and antique malls in 2010s, though I admit it's been a while since I saw a Zenit in the wild. I assume people snapped them all up when the Helios portrait lens started shooting up in price.

The one on the right is a bit of a oddity, at least in Canada. It's a Zenit 312m, made in Russia in 2004. This was one of the last cameras manufactured in Russia. According to the paperwork included, it sat around various warehouses until I bought it from a Ukrainian reseller in 2021.

[Certificate of acceptance and quality control notes for a Zenit 312M camera.](https://preview.redd.it/74yk59re6xgg1.png?width=2016&format=png&auto=webp&s=f512b89d29f92994a8ba6b5d20e97f5556c30f72)

While it has a ""modern"" looking plastic body, it is just a 1970s Soviet-era Zenit wearing a dodgy 1990s SLR Halloween costume. It has a viewfinder LED light meter, yes, but no DX coding and only six shutter speeds (B, 30, 60, 125, 250 and 500).

Like most Zenits it uses an M42 mount, which while dated offers easy access to decades of excellent glass. I bring the 312M to events where I expect to see a lot of other film shooters, because it generally confuses or delights a couple of people.

But I have another Russian Zenit SLR, even newer than this one. It was the last Zenit camera and I guess the most advanced consumer film SLR ever made by that country... the Zenit KM Plus! These were made until 2005, though only about 15,000 were produced.

[A new in box Zenit KM Plus with \\""motor driven action!\\"" Gosh!](https://preview.redd.it/kk64c94faxgg1.png?width=2016&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3622457e310c5fbfae6c08d207a6e8312e2d8f8)

It has advanced features! Like...

1. A Pentax K mount! It does NOT come with a K-mount version of the Helios-44, but rather a **very meh** plastic-bodied portrait lens, the Zenitar-K2 (55/f2). Still, there are lots of amazing Pentax lenses you can use.
2. It can read DX encoding! **But only up to 400 ISO**. There is no way to manually set the ISO or adjust the exposure. If you're shooting above 400, you just have to ignore the internal light meter and go manual. The camera auto exposure defaults to 100 ISO if it doesn't recognize the DX.
3. Substantially expanded shutter speed selection. (Auto, B, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30, 60, 125, 250, 500,1000, 2000.) This is good.

4. A very bright red LCD frame counter. It stays on for several seconds and it's bright enough to read a book. Imagine a digital clock from the late 1970s. This is... quirky.

5. Motor drive! CHUNK WHIRRRRR. CHUNK WHIRRRRR. Four AA batteries power the loudest motor drive I've ever heard. If you are trying to take candid photos, this will immediately inform everyone within 20 feet that you are either taking pictures or running a coffee grinder.

I actually like it as an oddity, though it's certainly not a camera I'd rely on for an important event. But the lack of diopter adjustment is what keeps me from using it. No matter what lens I use, or what glasses I wear, it will not focus properly through the viewfinder. There's a split prism, but it seems inaccurate, and the glass never quite comes into focus.

I essentially have to use it as a manual rangefinder, preferably stopped down in bright light, which limits use of the natural portrait lens. Every single previous Zenit (including the 312M of the similar vintage) I own has a circular diopter, adjusted by screwing/unscrewing it. The KM diopter is square and has absolutely no adjustment possible.

Has anyone else used any of the post-2000 Zenits? How do you find them? And if you have a KM Plus... how's the viewfinder? :D",9,1769972648.0,AnalogCommunity,3,1.0,False

I've given back all my loaner walkers, can't remember where I put my cane. I'm entering the zone, now, where I can go an hour (of walking, puttering around the house, making coffee) at a time where I totally forget that I had a hip transplant. Including when I mount stairs like a normal person.

That's not to say that I'm not being careful. \~\~EVERY TIME\~\~ Every time I get up off a couch or chair, I \~\~ALWAYS!! take a moment to ""gather"" myself. I'll stand, stretch a bit, and just test things. I'm not at the point where I'm just up and go!

I've discovered, after having seen the word somewhere on this sub, that I'm learning to \*\*\*trust\*\* my new hip. That's the thing... pre-op, I was always in fear of my hip collapsing on me. It never did, but it sure felt like it came close a few times.

And so now, as I close my second week, I'm learning to trust that my hip won't fail on me. The pain, pre-op, was the alarm bells going off I have to train myself that lack of alarm bells is a good think. That's weird.

Edit: Just now, I went to refill my coffee. End without thinking, for the first time (weird timing, I'll admit) I just up and went. I'm standing in the kitchen pouring my coffee, and the word ""hip"" just popped into my head. And there you go... I forgot about it. </edit>

I just had a chat with a friend who's about a year out of his own hip transplant. He's gearing up for a half marathon this summer. I. Can't. Even. But it made me think, triggered me a bit, even.

One of the most humiliating (if a bum hip could be anthropomorphised such) feelings I had pre-op came from the inability to \*\*run\*\*. I don't know why it was so debasing, so disempowering (I'm pretty sure it's not just me) but it's the one that hit me hard. No longer could I not be the slowest in my hiking party. I'd be the prey. But even being able to jog a little bit to get out of the way of a car, say, if needed. 

This one hit me hard.

I want to test my new hip. Just to jog for a few meters. Someone talk me out of it, let me know when I can do that.  


I am certain that my trail running days are over now. Never really liked that, only did it to get the girls. But I want to be able to job out of the way of a mugger, eventually.



Another rando thought.... Why (oh why) why are docs prescribing Oxycontin just off the top? Don't they try milder stuff? I know that pain responses vary wildly, and that I'm at the extreme end, perhaps, by tramacet and gabapentin has been solid for me. I just needed one hit of ketorolac about six hours post op, but that was it. Just curious is that's more of an American thang.

Anyhow, off for the first of my three 1000m walks for the day.

\- refilling the water filter pitcher every time I pour some water from it so it is literally always full

\- filling the electric kettle every evening so it is full for the morning 

\- keeping my gas tank at least half full

\- replacing pantry items, household items, first aid, etc on my next shopping trip after I’ve used something 

\- cooking a bit extra when I cook something that freezes well and freeze a couple of portions for another day

I don’t know that I’d really call stuff like this prepping, but when the water was turned off due to a broken main, I still had filtered water for my coffee and tea (without digging into my stored water).

1qt7a0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1qt7a0b/the_paradoxical_reaction_from_caffeine_is_a_myth/,"The paradoxical reaction from caffeine is a myth: Caffeine makes ADHD brains sleepy because of mast cell stabilization and histamine reduction, not Dopamine.","This has been bugging me for YEARS  
Everyone thinks people without ADHD drink coffee and go manic or something while we drink a double espresso and the noise in our heads finally shuts up enough for us to take a nap, or it simply makes us sleepy. 

The standard explanation is ""erm ADHD brains are different,"" or the slightly more scientific ""Paradoxical Reaction."" But those are silly blog site labels. The other explanation is the **Adenosine model** (caffeine blocks sleep pressure). But also allows dopamine levels to increase thus quieting one's mind because they're no longer looking for stimulation.

I went down a rabbit hole on the biochemical interactions between caffeine, mast cells, and neuroinflammation.

We usually think of histamine as having the flu, but in the brain histamine is a neurotransmitter that regulates wakefulness. That's why why people take antihistamines to sleep.   
Mast cells are immune cells that release histamine and inflammatory cytokines when triggered. In a lot of ADHD folks, there is a hypothesis that we have a higher baseline of neuroinflammation basically, a background hum of immune activity that creates brain fog, sensory sensitivity, etc etc blah blah blah

It turns out caffeine is a **Mast Cell Stabilizer**.  
[""Caffeine Acts as an Agonist of Siglec-6, Inhibits MRGPRX2-Triggered Mast Cell Degranulation and Anaphylactoid Reactions""](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/mi/9580121)   
caffeine acts as an agonist for **Siglec-6**, a receptor that basically tells mast cells to stop leaking histamine and cytokines. This would result in low grade inflammation getting reduced because of caffeine.   
Histamine makes people feel wired/anxious because it triggers **glutamate**, the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter. 

I also looked into **DAO (Diamine Oxidase)**, the enzyme that clears histamine from your system  
A study on **Lisdexamfetamine** showed it actually upregulates DAO expression  
[Interaction of Diamine Oxidase with Psychostimulant Drugs for ADHD Management](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/14/4666#)  
 This suggests that ADHD meds (and caffeine) might actually be helping us by cleaning *up* the excess histamine that’s making our brains feel itchy and overstimulated. This would explain why people get tired after taking their meds.

You might be thinking that this AND adenosine antagonism could be helping one's ADHD, this is fundamentally wrong.

Adenosine and Dopamine receptors (specifically *A2* and *D2* are often physically tethered together in the brain. The adenosine receptor acts as a ""muffler"" on the Dopamine receptor.  
**Normal Brain:** Adenosine binds, the muffler turns on, and dopamine signaling slows down. You feel tired.  
**Caffeinated up monster energy brain:** Caffeine sits in the adenosine slot. All it does is prevent the muffler from turning on and reducing dopamine, all you're doing is **preventing even less dopamine.**  
  
If you have ADHD, your baseline dopamine levels or receptor sensitivity are already low. If you have low dopamine, taking the ""muffler"" off doesn't really do anything dopamine wise.

In studies of *A2* receptor antagonism, if there isn't enough dopamine present to begin with, caffeine can't magically create a ""calming"" dopamine surge. It just keeps you awake and hollow. 

If caffeine makes you sleepy, you’re likely dealing with a baseline of neuroinflammation that caffeine is temporarily suppressing, which explains the link between inflammation, ADHD and other mental disorders",38,1769972401.0,Biohackers,19,0.94,False

(Longgg recurring dream),"Its just every night im in the same place, some city in Arkansas, (ive never even been to Arkansas) and im like watching this girl and her friends. The first dream just seemed like a bunch of normal teens, 2 of them go into a store and steal some liquor and they all go to this party and the girl ends up getting sick from drinking, nothing special. 

The second dream I watch her go to another party with her friends, but she leaves halfway through and goes to some older mans house to buy some harder drugs from him, im not sure what exactly but she buys them and goes back to the party. She ends up snorting something and passes out on a couch at the party.

Third dream she sits in her bedroom and does a few lines, she leaves her house and meets up with another girl. They talk about some other girl from their school getting pregnant and how they're worried because she is always partying and getting drunk. They go inside some like bodega or something and buy a few sandwiches, then go back to her house to snort more.

The last dream I just woke up from, she meets up with the same friend who asks her if she has anymore drugs, she says no but offers to go buy some more. She tells her friend to wait at the bodega for her and walks back to the mans apartment. She goes inside, the guy says he got some new product and asks her if she wants to try any, she says yes. She walks over to this coffee table and he hands her a little pill, she takes it. She's in the middle of trying to buy whatever she's been taking with her friends, but she starts to like idk pass out slowly? Like her speech is slowing down and her eyes start rolling a little bit. She ends up like not fully passed out, but laying on the floor barely awake. She tries calling her friend but it keeps going straight to voicemail. Eventually another older man walks in and she mutters ""dad?"" He tells her it will all be okay and he takes a bag of drugs from the dealer. She asks ""is this a sale?"" And then I woke up.

But for some reason nobody there likes me and nobody there is patient with me it’s just people being so passive aggressive and so harsh on me when I ask a question about a drink and how it’s made so I don’t mess up. I was on bev for a week, sandwich for a week, and drive thru for a week. I worked at a dunkin prior to this Dunkin and was only on counter once a week for 3 weeks so I learnt absolutely nothing from it and this Dunkin POS system is set up differently. When I was on drive thru for the first time customers kept mummbling or getting their own order wrong and ofc I’m the one that’s gonna get blamed for it and talked my ear off about messing up orders when it’s my first week on drive through. Some of the girls there can also be so mean to me like I forgot to grab a donut and the girl working beside me was so mean to me about it. Keep in mind I’m 18 and the rest of the girls are much much older than me with kids. One time I was in the middle of making drinks and the shuttle of coffee ran out but I had so many drinks I figured I’d do those drinks first and then do the shuttle and the guy on drive thru came up to me and gave me hella passive aggressive attitude abt not changing the shuttle out when I was clearly in the middle of a rush/order. When the manager is gone a lot of the shift leads will huddle up in a circle and I constantly hear my name or them talking shit. Obviously there is more reasons I really don’t feel like typing but it’s just horrible. They’re constantly secretly talking shit abt me out loud I got one order wrong on my first day on drive thru and the girl on drinks yelled “I’m getting fucking sick of this” . I thought I might’ve been overthinking so I went to the girl next to me I’m kinda friends with there and she was like don’t worry they don’t like me either and if they don’t like you they wouldn’t talk to you. (Every time I try to talk to them they’re either cutting me off or ignoring me). And she told me to stay away from a lot of the people who work here and that everyone has their own little social cue. Honestly, i love working at Dunkin I love making coffees and everything but I just can’t with the toxicity in these environments. I’m really nice to them and I’m really nice to customers so I dont get it. I don’t know what to do because I can’t exactly quit because I’m in college and trying to save up for a car.

In unserem neuen Blog-Artikel bekommt ihr eine Liste der am häufigsten irreführend verwendeten Begriffe rund um angeblich direkten Handel im Kaffeegeschäft. Ich erläutere dabei, warum sie problematisch sind und was sie wirklich bedeuten.  
  
**Direct Trade / Direkter Handel**  
**Relationship Coffee**  
**Directly sourced / direkt bezogen**  
**Farm Direct / From the Farm**  
**Enge Zusammenarbeit mit den Bauern**  
**Ethische Beschaffung**  
**Sustainably sourced / Nachhaltige Beschaffung**  
**Fairer als Fairtrade**  
**Smallholder-friendly / farmer-first**  
**Transparent**  
**Nähe suggerieren – Verantwortung vermeiden**  
  
All die oben genannten Begriffe folgen diesem Muster und sollen ein moralisches Wohlgefühl, Markenbindung und die Akzeptanz höherer Preise erzeugen. Risikoübernahme, langfristige Verpflichtungen und strukturelle Veränderungen bleiben außen vor.  
  
Dabei wäre eigentlich alles ganz einfach, wenn es die Konsumierenden denn wirklich interessieren würde.  
  
Hier sind die Fakten, die es euch ermöglichen zu sehen, ob die Rösterei es ernst meint, oder ob das Marketing einfach nur dreist lügt. Fast alle seriösen direktimportierenden Röstereien veröffentlichen die Informationen und Daten proaktiv. Wenn sie nicht aktiv kommuniziert werden, unterstelle ich irreführendes Marketing.  
  


* **Wie viel wurde über Börse gezahlt? Wie viel wurde genau bezahlt (egal, ob FOB oder Farmgate, eines von beiden muss eine direkt importierende Rösterei wissen)**
* **Gibt es Vorfinanzierung? Wenn ja; wieviel Prozent, wann und wieviel Zinsen?**
* **Um welche Mengen geht es? Was für einen Anteil machen sie im Gesamtvolumen der Rösterei aus?**
* **Um welche Qualitäten geht es dabei?**
* **Wer trägt Ernte(ausfall)- und Klimarisiken?**
* **Wie lange besteht die Beziehung?**
* **Was passiert, wenn die Qualität des Rohkaffees schwankt?**

  
Wenn eine Rösterei diese Daten nicht aktiv kommuniziert, lautet meine Empfehlung an alle interessierten Kaffeefreund:innen: stellt bei jeder Rösterei, die einen der obigen oder ähnliche Begriffe ohne genaue Definition verwendet, all diese Fragen. Wenn sie nicht beantwortet werden können oder wollen, könnt ihr euch sicher sein: Alles Gerede um das angebliche Direct Trade der betreffenden Rösterei ist eine hohle Phrase und dient nur dazu, euch moralisch gut zu fühlen und zu viel Geld für ganz normalen Kaffee auszugeben.

She's currently in Brazil but moving to Dublin (where I live) on February 3rd for work/school. We've been texting and had one video call.
The pattern that's confusing me:
She always responds eventually, but takes 12-24 hours between messages consistently
When I try to end conversations naturally (have a great day!), she asks follow-up questions and keeps it going
On the start she replied much faster than now
But it's her last week in Brazil so overwhelmed and busy?
She agreed to a video call, but deflected it 2 times before actually doing it
The call went well - pleasant conversation, she seemed engaged
After video call, when I mentioned meeting for coffee when she arrives, she said Yes, I would like having a coffee with you:)
This is her last week with family before the big move, so understandably emotional/busy
She posts stories spending time with family/friends but still takes 12-24hrs to reply to me
Asked about my job interview
Asked how I'm doing
We had video call
Said and agreed for coffee and date wines but that was before she went too busy mode.
Seems genuinely engaged when she does respond
Here's what I can't figure out:
Is she actually interested but just overwhelmed with a major international move and family goodbyes? Or am I a ""backup option"" she's keeping warm in case she wants to meet someone when she lands?
I don't want to over-invest emotionally if I'm just one of several options she's keeping open. But I also don't want to pull back if she's genuinely interested and just dealing with a massive life transition.
My current plan:
Keep responses brief and friendly when she texts
Don't initiate from now on
When she arrives and settles (maybe a week after), send one clear message: ""When are you free for coffee?""
If she gives a specific time/day: meet and see if there's chemistry
If she's vague (let's see, so busy): walk away
Does this sound reasonable? Any advice from people who've navigated similar situations?
EDIT: To clarify - I'm also talking to other women and not putting all my eggs in this basket. Just trying to figure out if this is worth pursuing at all or if the pattern already tells me everything I need to know.",1,1769972257.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

I know it is totally my fault, and the nerves absolutely wrecked me. The day before, I had a driving lesson, and my instructor said that I drove really well, and from past lessons, I never really had much to work on, and the things I did need to work on, such as mirrors, I would do everything I could to make sure that I was using my mirrors more, and appropriately. 

This might sound strange, but it might help with context, but I thought a coffee would do me well on the day of my test, however with the nerves, it seemed to exacerbate my shakeyness, and I never ever drink coffee before my lessons, so dont even know why I would have one before my test, probably to keep me alert?

I’ll never forget the moment a five‑year‑old I know sat in total silence for almost an hour… just coloring.  
No tablet, no noise, just crayons and calm.  
That’s when it clicked — coloring isn’t *just* fun, it’s therapy in disguise. 🖍️  

Here’s the truth a lot of parents quietly admit:  
Kids today are overstimulated. There’s too much to scroll, too much to watch, too little time to just *be.*  
Coloring slows everything down — and that slowness is gold.  

✨ A few wonderful perks you can start seeing the moment you turn a page:  
• **Mindful Focus:** Coloring helps kids breathe, center, and work through emotions they can’t yet explain.  
• **Boosted Confidence:** Simple, joyful shapes help them finish pages proudly — no frustration, all smiles.  
• **Screen‑Free Connection:** Sit beside them, grab a crayon, and watch conversations unfold naturally.  

Because I believe every child deserves that calm, I helped create a **free kids’ coloring ebook** built exactly for little hands and big imaginations.  
You can grab it here 👉 [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)

The designs are bold, fun, and designed to help your child pause and play — the peaceful kind of play.  
I’ve heard from parents who’ve added fifteen minutes of coloring before bed and swear the nightly meltdowns disappeared. Teachers say it helps their classes settle after recess.  

So, I’m sharing it again because it’s worth repeating:  
🌈 **Download your free kids coloring ebook** — and bring back calm creativity at home:

And if you have a moment to pay it forward — even a small donation of coloring tools or printing supplies can help children who can’t access art materials at all.  
Because art really *can* change a childhood.

I did some warehouse work in October,November and December but that got closed down before Christmas and now the agency don’t even bother to answer to our calls. Most warehouse are currently only hiring full time workers.

If we talk about big food chains like Starbucks, McDonalds, Costa Coffee, Subway and etc. I don’t know what’s their problem but they are not even giving me chance for an interview. Every time I apply all they reply is some bull\*hit sorry line and that they are moving on with someone else. I always wondered whom they moving on with but later I found out local store managers and main office staffing are always in conflict. Because store managers want to hire their relatives. I even got interviews from Sytner group and Sports Direct but Sytner rejected my application after 2 months of deliberations and sports direct store manager straight up rejected me on my face saying they are not hiring international students. And funny part is that it was casual sales assistant role which is tailored for International Students with 0 hours contract. Many agencies are not even picking up calls and if you visit them they don’t even let you in.

Many people suggested me to try walk in hunt. But all i can see is that most of these don’t even pay minimum wages. If that wasn’t bad enough they ask me for experience, i mean even after paying half the minimum wages they expect me to be ready to work. They don’t even want to train anyone. And after all this biggest problem here is that they have cliques. They don’t hire outside of their religion or ethnicity or nationality.

Trying to visualize a ""Strategic Audit"" or ""Consulting"" service without using those soul-sucking stock photos of ""diverse corporate team high-fiving in a glass room"" is brutal.

And honestly, prompting ""marketing strategy meeting"" into Midjourney just gives you weird geometry, alien text, and dead eyes. Clients smell the ""AI slop"" immediately.

I realized the mistake was trying to visualize an action (consulting) when I should have been visualizing the evidence (the deliverable).

So I tried a different workflow last week:

1. I printed a physical dummy version of our audit report (literally just a thick binder with our logo and the client's name on the cover).
2. I tossed it on my messy desk and took a photo with my iPhone.
3. I ran that photo through an e-com ""product transform"" tool .

Because the input was a real photo, the AI didn't hallucinate the text or the logo--it kept the ""product"" 100% pixel-perfect. But it generated a hyper-realistic environment around it: a mahogany boardroom table, a moody creative studio with a coffee cup, etc.

Suddenly I had ""lifestyle"" assets that felt expensive and tangible. The lighting/shadows were generated, but the focal point (our branding) was real.

It feels a bit like cheating, but the CTR is actually beating our motion graphics ads, and I didn't have to hire a photographer.

After seeing what hotel prices look like for the BTS weekend and talking with my wife, we’ve decided to open up our guest room for 1-2 people coming in from out of town for the concert. We live exactly one mile walking-distance from the venue, in a safe, quiet, upper-middle-class residential neighborhood. I’d also be happy to drive you most of the way to/from the venue if you prefer that. You’d have a private room with a queen bed plus a private, en suite bathroom with a shower. Nothing fancy, but probably just as nice as most hotel rooms in the area. I’ll even make you coffee in the morning lol.

We’ll have to do some basic vetting especially since we have two young kids, preferably starting with a real Reddit account with a decent comment/post history haha. And we do plan to charge, but less than all these crazy hotel prices seem to be. We’ll decide a number based on whether you’re staying one or two nights.

Ultimately, we’re basically hoping to help an out-of-town visitor have a slightly more positive first-time El Paso experience than they might have otherwise. Please DM or comment if you’re interested, and we can discuss the details!",0,1769971880.0,ElPaso,1,0.5,False

1qt6y2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qt6y2x/looking_for_upgrade_single_dose_grinder_maybe/,Looking for Upgrade Single Dose Grinder (Maybe Dual Grinder Setup) for Primarily Espresso with Pour Over Curiosity [$1000],"I have owned a Breville Barista Pro for several years as my introduction to espresso and pour-over. Having used it as both my espresso machine and grinder, it was a great introduction to espresso and milk-based drinks (cappuccinos, cortados). And while I used the grinder for Aeropress and V60 recipes, the final cup is ultimately fine but underwhelming, which always seems one-note.

But I am finding myself wanting more, and I am at the next stage of my espresso and coffee journey. So, a little while ago, I pre-ordered a Fellow Espresso Series 1 as my next espresso machine, and while I wait for it to ship, I am trying to find its grinder counterpart.

Location: US

Preferred Drink Types: Primarily espresso-based drinks.  In the morning, I drink more milk-based drinks (either one or two cappuccinos, with the occasional cortado), while in the afternoon I shift towards plain double espresso shots. I definitely want to delve into pour-over more and experiment with different beans, knowing I would have a better grinder.

Drink Frequency: I WFH, so that I would use it 2-4 times a day.

Space: I have a dedicated coffee bar, so it's not a big issue. Anything with a smaller footprint would be ideal, but it is not a dealbreaker.

Experience level: I have been homebrewing espresso for about 4 years. I am certainly looking for an “end-game” grinder or something close to it.

Manual or Electric: Electric

Tasting Preferences: For espresso, especially for my milk-based drinks, I love dark, chocolatey shots with a lot of body. I also love light roasted shots with clarity, especially around the fruit notes. With pour-over, I would stick to light or super-light roasts and try to get as much clarity as possible. Pour-over is where I am least informed, and where I definitely want to expand my world the most.

Design Language Preference: I would absolutely love a matte-black grinder with a more modern design.

Candidates: Three grinders have stuck out for various reasons. But I am open to other candidates.

\- Timemore Sculptor 078SSP: I LOVE the design and appreciate that it has a smaller footprint. This is my top candidate currently. Burr options seem to be limited, so it’s a conscious decision to go with the SSP burrs.

\- Varia VS6 Grinder: I love the modularity and range of burrs I can get with this grinder. I love the design as well, but it's much bigger than I expected. However, I can live with the size.

\- Fellow Ode 2: I know this grinder is only for pour-over. But I LOVE the design on this, and if it could do espresso as well, I think I would prefer this over the Timemore in terms of aesthetics and workflow. I am throwing in there to give a better idea of what I am looking for in terms of design language.

If it makes sense, I would also consider a dual-grinder setup (one for pour-over and one for espresso). For example, I could get the Ode 2 for pour over and a dedicated grinder for Espresso. I would go over the $1000 budget if there is a compelling pairing.

# Movement 5: Coda

The last echo of the broken note still clung to the rafters, even after Wellers had turned and walked away. I stood there, surrounded by emptiness. The chandeliers above no longer shimmered. The hush was heavier than silence, thicker than dust.

I looked out across the audience. The red velvet seats had returned to stillness. No more clawing shadows, no mouths stretched into forever. Just rows upon rows of perfect emptiness, as if no one had ever occupied them. As if the things I had seen, felt, feared… had never been here at all.

But one chair drew my eye.

Front row, center-left. Seat 7. Claire's seat.

No one sat there now. But the cushion bore the faintest indent, the shape of someone having sat with poise, stillness, care. Pressed into the velvet was a ghost of a presence, more intimate than anything else in the hall.

I stepped down from the stage, giving the piano one last look. They were cold now. Lifeless. No voice left in them. Just polished wood and quiet dust.

Down the aisle I walked, past where the shadows once writhed. Towards the corridor Wellers had vanished into, the door parted just enough to suggest invitation.

As I walked through, the ground beneath my feet had begun to crack. Hairline fractures like veins in skin, running beneath the surface. The sconces lining the corridor flickered as I entered like they were deciding whether to stay.

I moved slowly. The hush of the hall followed me into the corridor, but here it was different, denser. Almost syrupy. Like I was walking into soundlessness made solid.

The corridor twisted subtly with each step, just wrong enough to feel it in my bones. Paintings lined the walls, portraits of men and women in recital dress, all expressionless. The further I went, the more warped their shapes became: limbs too long, necks too thin, eyes that didn’t point the same direction.

And then, I saw her.

Claire.

Or what looked like her.

She was seated in the painting, hands resting in her lap, dark hair tucked behind one ear, a blue dress like the one from the recital. But this wasn’t the frozen poise of performance. This was different. She was looking at me. No…through me.

The brushwork shimmered like wet paint. I stepped closer. Her eyes seemed to change as I did. Widening, softening. There was recognition in them. Sorrow. I raised my hand, fingers trembling. I didn’t want to touch it. I just needed to see if she would stay.

I blinked.

She was gone.

The frame was empty. Just aged canvas now, the ghost of a portrait that hadn’t ever been. I stood in front of it for a long while, unable to breathe. Then I heard footsteps, soft and steady, from up ahead.

Wellers.

I turned and followed.

Eventually, I found him standing at the end of the corridor, motionless. His hands folded behind his back like a curator admiring a painting. Before him loomed a tall door of polished black wood, inlaid with a mirror that didn’t reflect a thing. No light, no room, no me. Just a yawning pane of stillness. Like it hated the concept of its existence.

He didn’t look at me when I approached.

“This is the quietest part of Bellmare,” he said softly. “She breathes slowest here.”

“What is this door?” I asked.

He tilted his head slightly, as if listening to some distant instrument tuning itself. “A mirror, Mr. Goodpray. But not to what’s in front of it.”

I stared at the door. It pulsed slightly. Like it was waiting.

His eyes, dark and glasslike, held no warmth. But no cruelty either. Just something deep. Old.

“You talk like you’re part of this place,” I said.

“Wellers has been many things,” he answered, almost wistfully. “Concierge. Usher. Custodian. Mouthpiece.” He placed a hand gently on the doorframe. “But never the composer.”

“And who is?”

“The one who listens. Who gathers. Who waits for the final note to fall.” He glanced at me. “But not all music is meant for endings. Some… simply linger.”

My breath had fogged slightly, and I hadn’t noticed until now. The hallway behind us seemed longer than it should have been. Like we’d stepped outside of something. Or beneath it.

“Wellers,” I asked, quietly. “Is there a way out?”

He regarded me. “That depends. Some find freedom in silence. Others in crescendo.” He paused. “But you, Mr. Goodpray, you’ve already given the performance. The question is what you do after the curtain falls.”

We stood before the mirror door. It didn’t show us. Just a pitch-black depth. Like staring into a river without bottom.

“Well then,” he said, and his voice barely rose above the breath of the hall. “Shall we proceed?”

I nodded, though everything inside me screamed the opposite.

And together, we stepped through.

Beyond the mirror, the world shed its shape. It was absence, stretched into suggestion. The corridor was gone, replaced by something less built and more remembered. Space didn’t hold here. The ground shifted and pulsed beneath us like walking on water. The memory of walls curled like parchment soaked in time.

We were walking, but nothing moved.

Memories blinked into view, then vanished. A field I’d never walked in. A woman who looked like Claire, but wasn’t. A recital hall where the ceiling bled stars. A cracked piano in an old train car. Children’s laughter from a mouthless choir.

“None of this makes sense,” I muttered.

“Wellers never promised it would,” he said beside me.

“You... you aren’t Wellers. Are you?""

A pause. “No.”

I stopped. The air stood still. “Then what are you?”

He turned his face to me, and in the not-light of this place, it blurred slightly. Like a portrait that hasn't fully dried.

“I’m the third son of the one who buried the stars,” he said softly, as if the words were old and tired. “I was composed before the bell was first struck. I listened. I learned.”

His voice was Wellers, but not just Wellers.

“All that remained was silence,” he said. “So I filled that silence with voice. From voice, I became music—song, echo, memory. I learned to wear men like overcoats. They walked me into churches, into concert halls, into cities built on sorrow. I listened to their notes. I remembered them.”

“And Wellers?”

“He let me in,” the voice replied. “Long ago. In grief. In yearning. He wanted to remember something so badly that I stayed to help him.”

“What did he want to remember?”

There was a hush, like a page turning. “A girl with hair like copper chords. She played violin in the hollow before the Hollow.”

Silence settled. I didn’t push that subject further.

“You said you listened,” I said again. “But why me? Why now?”

The not-light around us shimmered, and for a moment, the corridor folded into something like water. It was navy, with a full moon hanging heavy above, its pale light fractured by waves that never broke. “You didn’t drown in your sorrows,” Wellers murmured, voice low and sure, “though many do. You faced the currents, though the depths called.”

The faint image shifted. The watery veil around us now twisted into shadows, deep and near, weighted like the blackened surface of a lake at midnight, cold and silent. “Nor did you turn away, closing yourself to the echoes that cry in silence, burying your voice beneath a silence not meant for keeping, hiding passion and love beneath the frozen dark. That kind of silence suffocates.”

I looked at him, the figure who was not quite Wellers, and waited.

“You played,” he said again, softer now, “the grief in your bones. And places like Bellmare remember songs like that. You gave your mourning shape. That makes you more than an audience.”

I wanted to be angry. But there was no room for rage anymore.

“Why didn’t you take me earlier?”

He turned his head just slightly. “You weren’t ready to let go.”

The path beneath us flickered like piano keys pressed by invisible fingers. Each step sounded like notes played in a room with no walls.

“Is Wellers… still alive?”

“For a time. Long enough. He served the hall well. Carried its quiet for decades. A good host.”

“And now?”

A small smile touched the corner of Wellers’ borrowed mouth.

“He’s fading. The song is softer now.”

I swallowed the lump in my throat. “And Claire? The real Claire?”

A longer pause this time. The silence felt like a drawn breath just before the crescendo.

“She passed through,” the voice said. “But she was not taken. Some spirits write themselves louder than I can erase.”

I didn’t know whether to thank it or mourn again.

We walked a little farther, and the non-existent path finally formed into something definite. A door. Wooden, carved with a wreath of thorns around a single keyhole. No handle. No reflection.

The thing wearing Wellers looked at me.

“This next part,” he said, “you walk alone.”

I stepped through the door and into home.

The apartment smelled like rain and dust on the sill. It wasn’t just any place. It was ours. Claire’s scarf hung on the hook beside the kitchen. One of her books lay open on the coffee table, spine cracked in that same way it always had. The window was cracked an inch, the curtains breathing in and out like lungs trying to remember how. The walls were warm with afternoon gold. The kind that comes just before a storm, when the air thickens and memories slip through the cracks. I half-expected to hear the kettle whistle from the kitchen, or the soft thump of her feet padding across the floor.

Instead, there was only music.

It came from the piano, just out of view, in the far room. Gentle, slow. Each note held too long, like it didn’t want to let go.

I turned the corner.

And there she was.

Claire. Not in blue. Not in black. Not some twisted reflection from Bellmare’s throat. But her. Hair loose and dark, falling like a ribbon down her back. She wore an old grey cardigan with a hole in the sleeve. Her fingers moved across the keys with grace.

She didn’t look up at me.

I stepped closer. “Claire?”

She finished the song, let the silence land gently, then turned. Her eyes met mine. And for a moment, the ache in my ribs untwisted itself.

“Hi,” she said.

I couldn’t speak at first. My breath had caught somewhere between the years.

“I—I’ve missed you,” I managed.

“I know,” she said, and smiled, sad and warm. “I’ve been with you the whole time, you know. Even when you couldn’t see me.”

I knelt beside her, not daring to touch her.

“Was it all real? The Hollow, the hall, the music?”

Her eyes moved to the piano. “Some places are made from grief,” she said. “And some scores stay because we keep playing them.”

“I tried to save you.”

“I know,” she whispered. “But I didn’t need saving. You did.”

A silence hung between us like a last note waiting to fade. Her hand reached out and hovered above mine, as if contact would break the illusion.

“You can let go now, Liam,” she said.

“I don’t know how.”

She blinked slowly, like a curtain falling.

“Then just try.”

I did.

And when I opened my eyes again, she was gone. The piano was empty, the keys still warm. The sunlight had dimmed, and the room had folded itself back into memory. As I stood, I felt the absence land quietly in my chest. This time, it wasn't jagged like before, but soft. Bearable.

Behind me, a shadow crossed the doorway.

“Wellers,” I said.

He nodded once, eyes dark and calm.

“To leave,” he said, voice still too calm, “there must be a price to be paid.”

“I’ve paid,” I said, without hesitating. “I’ve played. I’ve wept. I’ve given her up.”

He tilted his head slightly, something ancient flickering behind his eyes.

“Yes,” he said, voice richer now, more layered. Like a choir echoed inside his chest. “You have. And I do not keep what was freely given.”

He reached into his pocket and pulled a folded piece of paper, handing it to me silently. I unfolded it carefully, tracing the words with a finger.

“Compensation: Solace”

I placed the letter gently on the kitchen table, the same where it first appeared. The start, and end, of this circle.

He stepped aside, revealing a new door. One I hadn’t seen before, even in dreams. There was no sound behind it. No music. Just wind, and the scent of soil and ash.

“Wellers is resting now,” the voice added, quieter. “He heard enough songs for one life. Maybe too many.”

I looked back once more at the piano. The room. The absence. The fading visage of Wellers.

Then I walked through.

The door didn’t creak as it opened. It breathed, like something sighing its last. I stepped through into air that was far too still. The sky was grey, but free of storm and smoke. It was the kind of sky the world forgot about. Dorset Hollow lay before me, or rather, what remained. The town had been consumed. Not freshly. This wasn’t the aftermath of a sudden fire. No—this had happened decades ago.

Charred timbers stuck out from cracked sidewalks like bones. Vines and ivy choked storefronts whose signs had long since faded to memory. The post office was caved in. The diner was gone entirely, only the metal skeleton of the DIN(N)ER sign left, its last flicker long gone.

The silence was total. It felt cleared, like the performance had finally ended after final act. I walked through the ruins, boots crunching cinder and glass. No one followed. No voices, no notes. Just the wind.

I passed the statue. It was now collapsed, overgrown, eroded to the knees. No piano. No scarf. Just a stone base lost to time. But it was the church that stilled me.

Saint Cecilia’s stood at the end of the street like a forgotten sentinel. Its steeple was cracked. Its sign hung crooked, the lettering barely legible.

*“Sing unto Him, ye who mourn.”*

The windows were blackened from the inside with more than just soot. Scorched glass, melted and warped, like they’d burned in a fire that never touched the rest of the building. And behind them, even in daylight, there was that same impossible glow. Like flames from a time far gone. I didn’t go inside. I just stood there a while. Not praying. Not asking. Just listening. And the church, mercifully, was silent.

I found my car at the entrance of the town. It was dusty, but intact. The keys laid on the hood.

The drive home was long, but uneventful. Roads uncoiled beneath my tires like ribbon being drawn back from something. Towns flickered past, alive and indifferent. Gas stations. Trees. Traffic lights. The world had kept going.

And now, so would I. 

When I stepped into the apartment, the scent of old life greeted me. Mail piled by the door. A coat left hanging. Silence. The same silence from Bellmare, but this time, it wasn't malicious.

I crossed the room, past where her photo still sat. Framed in silver, smiling in spring. I didn’t touch it.

Instead, I went to the piano.

It had been under a sheet since the day I stopped playing. Not out of spite. Just… pain.

I took a breath, and peeled the cloth back.

Dust swirled, catching the amber light of the setting sun. The keys were yellowed slightly. The wood dry. But it was whole.

I sat down.

No voices whispered. No shadows reached for me. No notes forced themselves into my hands. Just silence.

I placed my fingers on the keys. And then, for the first time in years, I played.

Not for her. Not for anyone watching. Just to let something go.

The melody was soft, simple. I don’t even know where it came from. But it felt like closing a door.

When I finished, I left my hands resting on the keys.

In the hush that followed, I almost imagined I heard someone whisper “thank you.”

But no one was there.

And that was okay.

I’m considering a 9-10 night trip to Sri Lanka at the end of March and would love some advice from people who’ve been there.

A bit about me: I’m F24 from the United States. I’ve been at 16 countries and it’s been a mix of solo trips, friend trips, and a group tour to a hard to get to country in Africa.

I usually like trips that mix culture, nature, and some partying — not just lying on a beach the whole time or only hanging around a hostel. I enjoy trying local food, experiencing cool nature, exploring unique cities and architecture, and experiencing authentic local life. I enjoy countries that are lesser known and “medium difficulty,” but I also would like to meet travelers around my age, and don’t want to do anything extremely arduous, such as hitchhiking for multiple hours.

I’ve also noticed online that some areas of Sri Lanka seem like they might be starting to gentrify and become more tourism developed. I love an occasional locally owned cute coffee shop, but in my research, I’m mostly seeing bougie restaurants catered towards Westerners. I’m curious how true that is on the ground and whether it’s still easy to find more local, less commercial experiences. I’m also seeing a lot of videos of women dressing immodestly in villages.

Would you recommend Sri Lanka for someone like me, or suggest I look somewhere else instead? And if so, would loveeee itinerary, hostel or home stay recommendations. Thanks!",1,1769971497.0,solotravel,3,0.6,False
1qt6tta,https://i.redd.it/9u7zizawhxgg1.jpeg,Philos review one month later,"I got this Philos one month ago and I’ve been using it, so I’ll do a small review. I’m not a super coffee nerd, so this review is more like a normie point of view.

I have two burrs: the 189 and the 200D.

My previous grinder was a Eureka grinder and I’m keeping it.

The first week was really bad. Inconsistency all over the place — one click on the grinder resulted in a 4-second change. I really thought it wasn’t worth it. Buuut… after some seasoning, things changed.

The grinder came with the 189 burr, but this taste profile was already covered for me by the Libra, so I switched to the 200D. I’m not a handyman and I was afraid of changing it, but it was very easy. The 200D came with a surprise: although it has less body, it STILL has body. To me, it’s a sweet spot. I can clearly see the difference between it and the Libra. With the 189, almost no difference.

I had a light roast that I didn’t like that much. When using it with the Philos, it became one of my favorites. Even chocolate-forward coffees taste better.

In the end, I’ll keep both the Libra and the Philos. The Libra is for the chocolate beans I drink in the morning, making cappuccinos. GBW is fast, and when I’m entertaining, it’s fast and reliable.

The Philos will be there for lighter roasts and special coffee time.

The workflow was a surprise to me. It’s not as bad as I thought it would be, and you get used to it very quickly. No static, no mess. It’s not loud.

And the size? It’s not that big when you see it up close, but it’s not that small either.

Is it worth it? Depends. If you prefer chocolate / medium to medium-dark roasts, probably no. In the cup it tastes better, but not thaaaat better to justify the cost. You won’t regret buying one, though.",54,1769971467.0,espresso,23,0.95,False

I’m looking for a developer who’d be interested in building a very simple, focused app with me as a partner, not as a paid gig (I’m almost broke, so I want to be upfront about that).

# The core idea

A voice brain dump app where you can:

* Hit record and talk for any length of time (minutes or hours).
* The app transcribes everything locally.
* Then it summarizes the session and extracts clear action items (locally)

That’s it. No 50 features, no “all-in-one productivity platform” bullshit. Just a tool to offload your brain with your voice and get something usable back.

Target users (including me):

* Entrepreneurs who think out loud and feel mentally cluttered.
* Students who want to talk through concepts instead of typing notes.
* Writers/creatives with a blocked mind who need to rant and then see structure.

# Product constraints (deliberate, not accidental)

* Free for life for the core features.
* Offline-first / local processing.
* No data sharing, no selling data, no ads.
* Premium tier: maybe syncing, better models, or cloud backups for people who want convenience. I’m not expecting this to make big money, just “a few bucks” level revenue (if it ever does).

For free users, I don’t want any infra-heavy stuff, so ideally I don’t have to bear ongoing costs beyond my time and whatever minimal infra we absolutely need (I'm ready to bear it).

# Why I want this

I genuinely needed a tool like this for myself.

I found VoicePal, which is close to what I want, but:

* It only gives a 1-day trial.
* Then jumps to an annual premium model.
* And it takes your data / uses it in the cloud.

I don’t want that. I want something:

* I can trust with my brain dumps (even my SSN).
* That doesn’t lock me into a subscription just to think out loud.
* That can also help other people once it exists.

This is not a “startup pitch to raise millions,” it’s literally “I need this, and if we build it, others will probably want it too.”

# Scope / complexity

I’m intentionally keeping it very minimal:

Core:

* Record voice (long-form).
* Transcribe.
* Summarize + extract action items.

Nothing insane. It's more about brain dump than to do listing.

We can iterate later, but the first version should be boringly simple and useful.

# My situation and what I can offer

* I’m almost broke, so I can’t pay a dev fee.
* I can:
   * Help with product thinking, UX, positioning, and user research.
   * Handle testing, feedback, and iteration.
   * Do basic ideation and community outreach.
* I’m open to meaningful revenue sharing if we ever make anything from the premium layer.

# What I’m looking for in you

* You enjoy building small, focused tools.
* You care about privacy and offline-first design.
* You’re realistic: this might never make serious money, and you’re okay with that.
* You’re fine with async collaboration (I’m in India, but we can coordinate).

If this sounds interesting, drop a comment or DM.

I’m not trying to sell a dream here. This is a “scratch my own itch, maybe help others, maybe make a little coffee money” type project. If that aligns with you, I’d love to talk.",1,1769971353.0,SideProject,12,0.57,False
1qt6r6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qt6r6x/confused_by_girl_that_i_like_any_thoughts/,"Confused by girl that i like, any thoughts?","Part 1: The Meeting

I have some questions about female psychology, and I would especially appreciate it if the women here could weigh in.

There is a girl from my faculty that I’ve had a crush on for 2-3 months. We didn't know each other well because we didn't have many classes together, but we made eye contact constantly. I followed her on Instagram, and she accepted. After about 2-3 weeks of just exchanging glances, her close friend became friends with my friend group. I used this connection to get introduced.

When we finally met in person, she was excited but very quiet and didn't talk much. We invited her and her friends to a New Year's Eve house party, and she accepted.

Part 2: New Year's Eve

Everyone at the party knew I liked her, so I sat next to her. We chatted, and I learned she had absolutely no experience with relationships or flirting—she had never had a boyfriend.

Later, she went to the balcony for fresh air. She was a bit tipsy (it was her first time drinking). I joined her. At the time, I had a lung issue (a tear/pneumothorax), but I wanted to smoke a cigarette. When she asked why I was coughing, I explained my condition. She immediately took the cigarette from my hand and threw it away out of concern. The night ended normally after that.

Part 3: Getting Closer & The Surgery

The next day, we went on a ski trip. She came even though her close friend didn't, basically just to be in our environment.

A few days later, I found out I needed a risky surgery. I was genuinely worried I might not make it, so I wanted to know what she thought of me. I had her friend ask her.

She told her friend: ""I went to the party and the ski trip to get to know him, but I don't see him that way. I don't want a relationship."" She was also annoyed that I didn't ask her myself.

To fix this, I invited her for coffee. I explained that I was shy because of the surgery risk. She didn't say anything, she just smiled. However, we ended up sitting there for 3 hours with the conversation flowing perfectly. We started talking on Instagram constantly after that, mostly discussing movies, and she joined our group plans.

Part 4: Mixed Signals

During my surgery period, my friends insisted we were flirting. I would send her videos of me driving fast, and she would get angry (worried about my safety). When I got out of surgery, she checked on me constantly.

On Instagram, we were like a couple, but in person, she was still shy. She even asked about my ex-girlfriend and why we broke up.

After 1-2 weeks of this, I wanted to make it official because I still didn't know where I stood. I asked her friend to sound her out again.

Here is the twist: Her friend (let's call her Elif) had recently been used for sex and dumped by one of my friends. My crush told Elif, ""I'm afraid I'll experience what you experienced,"" implying she was scared I would use her. However, she admitted to Elif that she saw me as more than a friend.

Thinking things were positive, I asked her directly a few days later: ""What do you think about our situation? You seem a bit cold.""

She replied: ""I am pulling myself back so that you don't think we are anything more than friends.""

I was shocked. She then said, ""I think it's better if we stay friends."" I didn't push it.

My Question:

Why would she tell her friend she has feelings/fears about a relationship, but tell me she just wants to be friends? Is she just scared because of her lack of experience, or was she never interested?",1,1769971309.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Brown sugar is just one of those things in my house that I'll buy a pack of, use only so much of and then no matter what I do it goes hard and I can't measure it out properly after and gets added to tea or coffee one chunk at a time until gone. Not a super pleasant experience.

Brown sugar is SO EASY to make. Ratio is: 1 cup of white sugar to 1-2 tablespoons of molasses. Depending on if you want light brown sugar or dark brown sugar respectively. Just add to a mixer and in a few seconds you have a soft batch of brown sugar. 

White sugar is way cheaper, I can buy it in bulk at Costco. I got a small carton of fancy molasses that lasts in the pantry for years and was less than 5 bucks. Whenever I need brown sugar, I mix a batch up super quick for exactly how much I need and that's it. No leftover brown sugar, no bag of brown sugar rocks in the cupboard and so so easy.

Coming from an iPhone 16 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro,"Let me start of by saying that I'm not a fanboy of any particular brand. I switch phones regularly and also like to switch between iOS and Android. 

For the last year Ive been using an iPhone 16 Pro and had no issues with it whatsoever. The camera was good as always. The battery life however did disappoint me. 

Then I got the urge to switch to Android again and bought the Pixel 10 Pro. But wow, the battery life of that phone was horrendous. I sent it back after 1 week. I liked the Google OS and the camera's, but the battery life was a huge disappointment.

I switched back to the 16 Pro and was considering getting the 17 Pro. 

Then the OnePlus 15 came out and immediately I was hooked on the looks. I did my research and concluded that I was okay with the camera being maybe a little bit worse than other flagship competitors. I was particularly intrigued by the RAM size, the CPU and the storage space. 

And so I got my first OnePlus phone ever. 
After daily driving it for 2 months, I can say that this is one of the best phones Ive ever owned. And I had a lot.

Things In like the most about this phone:

- The design. 
I have the black version and I think it looks absolutely stunning. I like the materials used and it feels genuinely good in my hands.

- Speed.
This phone is fast. Really fast. Switching between apps, doing intensive work, playing demanding games, its all easy for this phone. Really impressed.

- The OS.
Maybe I will get hate for this, but I really like the design of the OS and the glass effects. Yes it looks like iOS, but who cares. As a person that uses both, this OS feels as nice or even better than what I had in my iPhone. 

- Sound quality and screen.
Playing music and watching videos is a joy in the phone. No complaints here. The screen is crisps and smooth.

- Fingerprint scanner.
Blazing fast. Unlocks instantly. 

- BATTERY LIFE AND CHARGE SPEED. 
I was shocked by the battery performance. Ive never had a phone that lasted this long. Two days, sometimes three. Thats crazy. And the charging speed is insane too. 
I used to charge my phones when I went to bed. 
Now I do it when I drink my morning coffee before going off to work. 20 minutes and Im good to go.

------------------------------------

Now lets about the cameras.
My honest opinion? They are good. When I was doing my research before buying, I already had low expectations. But honestly, it exceeded my expections and I find them genuinely good. 

I am satisfied with the shots and videos. I got two kids that are my joy in life and I take a lot of pictures and videos of them and Ive never thought ""wow this quality is shit"" or ""I dont like this photo"". 

Now am I saying that the cameras are perfect? No, I liked the way my iPhone took videos better. Just more smooth. But that doesnt mean the video quality on this phone is bad. Its just okay and enough for my use case. Im no vlogger or YouTuber, so thats fine.

When I compare the photos I took on my iPhone, my Pixel 9 Pro (returned the 10 but still have the 9) and my S24Ultra, honestly, there is not much difference between the photos in my eyes. Im no expert. But I like the portraits on my pixel 9 Pro the most. Just stands out.

The selfie camera is good. Better then on my Pixel 9 Pro and about the same as my S24. Ultra. 

----------------------------------------------------

Side note, the IR remote app is amazing.

And dont let the reviews online get in your head. Just do your own unbiased research. Genuinely a straight up killer phone.

realize you've got another day of doing stuff you don't care about, pretending to be someone
you're not, and living on autopilot? Yeah, that used to be me too. And honestly, it's most people.
We're all out here grinding through days that feel meaningless, wondering why we're so damn
exhausted all the time.
Here's what I learned after digging through tons of research, podcasts, and books on
psychology and life design: most of us never actually designed our lives. We inherited them. We
took the default settings, the expectations from family, society, Instagram, whatever, and we just
ran with it. No wonder we feel trapped.
But here's the good news, the science shows that you can rewire this. Not overnight, not with
some bullshit vision board alone, but with real strategic choices. I'm going to break down exactly
how to do it, backed by solid research and real tools that actually work.
## Step 1: Figure Out What You Actually Want (Not What You Think You Should Want)
Most people skip this step because it's uncomfortable as hell. We're so conditioned by external
expectations that we don't even know what WE want anymore. Your parents wanted you to be a
doctor. Your friends are all buying houses. Social media says you should be traveling the world
or building a startup.
Reality check: None of that matters if it doesn't light YOU up.
Start with this brutal honesty exercise. Grab a notebook and write down:
* What would I do if money wasn't an issue?
* What activities make me lose track of time?
* What did I love doing as a kid before the world told me what to care about?
* If I knew I'd die in 5 years, what would I regret not doing?
This isn't some woo woo bullshit. Research from Stanford psychologist BJ Fogg shows that
behavior change only sticks when it aligns with your actual values, not imposed ones. His book
Tiny Habits breaks down how most people fail at change because they're chasing someone
else's definition of success. It's insanely practical and will completely shift how you think about
building a life that fits you.
## Step 2: Audit Your Current Life Like a Detective
You can't design a new life if you don't know what's broken in your current one. Time for a
ruthless audit. Look at your typical week and categorize everything:
* Energy givers (things that excite you, recharge you)
* Energy vampires (things that drain you, make you feel dead inside)
* Neutral (necessary but not meaningful)
Be honest. Maybe your high-paying job is an energy vampire. Maybe scrolling TikTok for 3
hours is too. Maybe that friend who only complains is sucking your soul dry.
Cal Newport talks about this in Deep Work. He's a Georgetown computer science professor who
studied how the most successful people structure their lives. His research shows that most
people waste 60-80% of their time on shallow, meaningless activities that don't align with what
they actually value. This book will piss you off in the best way because you'll realize how much
time you've been throwing away.
## Step 3: Kill Your Energy Vampires (Yes, Actually Kill Them)
This is where most people chicken out. They identify what's draining them but don't do shit
about it. You've got to start cutting, delegating, or minimizing your energy vampires. Not all at
once, but strategically.
* Hate your commute? Can you negotiate remote work or move closer?
* Draining relationship? Set boundaries or end it.
* Soul-sucking job? Start building an exit plan, even if it takes a year.
Research from Dr. Laurie Santos at Yale (she teaches the most popular course on happiness)
shows that environmental design is way more powerful than willpower. You can't white-knuckle
your way through a life you hate. You have to change the environment.
Check out her podcast The Happiness Lab. She breaks down the science of why we're all so
miserable despite having everything, and what actually works to change it. Real studies, zero
fluff.
## Step 4: Design Your Ideal Week (Then Actually Live It)
Here's a game changer: stop living reactively. Most people wake up and let the day happen TO
them. Emails, demands, other people's priorities. You're not designing your life, you're just
responding to everyone else's.
Instead, design your ideal week. Block out time for:
* Deep work (focused, meaningful work that moves your goals forward)
* Relationships (actual quality time, not just existing near people)
* Physical health (movement, sleep, real food)
* Mental space (reading, thinking, creating, not consuming)
* Fun (shit you do just because it makes you happy)
Use time blocking. Schedule these like appointments you can't cancel. Treat your own life with
the same respect you give to your boss's calendar.
There's an app called Structured that helps you design your day visually. It's stupidly simple but
forces you to actually plan instead of just reacting.
## Step 5: Build Micro-Habits That Support Your Design
Big changes don't stick. You know this. You've tried the New Year's resolution thing. What works
is tiny, consistent actions that compound over time.
Want to wake up excited? Build a morning routine that doesn't suck. But don't try to become a
5am yoga-meditating-journaling robot overnight. Start with ONE thing. Maybe it's 5 minutes of
stretching. Or making your bed. Or drinking water before coffee.
BJ Fogg's Tiny Habits method is backed by 20 years of behavior research at Stanford. He
shows that the key to lasting change is making habits so small they're impossible to fail at, then
letting them grow naturally. The book gives you a step-by-step formula.
If you're looking for something that pulls all these resources together in a way that actually
sticks, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that's been solid for this kind of thing. It's built
by a team from Columbia and Google, and what makes it different is the personalized learning
plan feature. You can type in something specific like ""I feel stuck in my career and want to
design a more meaningful life"" and it generates a structured plan pulling from books like
Designing Your Life, Deep Work, research on behavior change, and expert interviews on life
design.
You can adjust the depth too, from quick 10-minute summaries when you're busy to 40-minute
deep dives with real examples when you want to go deeper. The voice options are surprisingly
good, there's this smoky, calm narrator that's perfect for commutes or right before bed. It also
has a virtual coach you can chat with about your specific struggles, which helps when you're
trying to figure out what's actually draining you versus what matters.
Another great tool is the Finch app. It gamifies habit building with a little bird that grows as you
complete daily self-care tasks. Sounds cute but it's surprisingly effective at making you actually
do the things.
## Step 6: Surround Yourself with People Who Get It
You can design the perfect life on paper, but if you're surrounded by people who drain you,
judge you, or keep you small, you're screwed. Research shows you become the average of the
5 people you spend the most time with.
This doesn't mean dump all your friends. But it does mean being strategic about who gets your
energy. Seek out people who are building lives they're excited about, who challenge you to
grow, who celebrate your wins instead of competing with you.
Join communities, take classes, find your people. They're out there, but you have to put yourself
in environments where they exist.
## Step 7: Iterate Like Your Life is a Startup
Here's the thing nobody tells you: designing your life isn't a one-time thing. You're going to try
stuff that doesn't work. You're going to change. What excited you at 25 might bore you at 35.
That's normal.
Treat your life like a startup. Test, measure, adjust. Every few months, do another audit. What's
working? What's not? What needs to change? Stay flexible. The goal isn't perfection, it's
alignment. You want to wake up most days feeling like your life reflects who you actually are and
what you actually care about.
Bill Burnett and Dave Evans wrote Designing Your Life, and it's based on Stanford's most
popular course. They're literally design professors who applied design thinking to life. The book
has practical exercises for prototyping different versions of your life before committing. Super
actionable.
## Step 8: Accept That It's Going to Be Uncomfortable
Real talk: designing a life you love means saying no to a lot of what society expects. It means
disappointing people. It means uncertainty. It means risk. Most people stay stuck because
staying stuck is more comfortable than the discomfort of change.
But here's what I realized: there are two types of discomfort. There's the discomfort of growth
(scary but energizing) and the discomfort of stagnation (soul-crushing and permanent). Pick
your pain.
The research is clear: people who take calculated risks to align their lives with their values
report way higher life satisfaction, even when things get hard. Regret for things not tried is way
worse than regret for things that didn't work out.
You've got one life. You don't get a practice round. Stop waiting for permission to design it the
way you want. Start now, start small, but start. Wake up tomorrow and take one tiny action
toward the life you actually want to live.",2,1769971144.0,psychesystems,0,1.0,False

I’m a 40 year old guy from Canada, heading down to LA in April. I’ll have about five full days there to myself before meeting up with some friends.

I’ve visited LA a few times already, most recently back in 2017, so I’m already familiar-ish with the lay of the land and have seen and done a lot during my past trips there.

I’m looking for advice from locals on some cool areas to check out and wander around in that I haven’t done yet and otherwise wouldn’t know of or consider on my own. Basically, I want to use this trip as an opportunity to experience things more as a local, less as a tourist.

I will be staying somewhere in Hollywood or West Hollywood, and I won’t be driving. Walking and Ubers will be my main mode of transportation.

So far, some of the things I have in mind are:

\-Walking through the Hollywood Hills to the Hollywood sign. Yes, I know this is touristy, but it’s something I like to do each time I’m there. :)

\-Wandering through the Hollywood Forever and Pierce Brothers in Westwood cemeteries.

\-Heading to Anaheim to check out an Angels game to cross another ballpark off my list.

\-Checking out Pasadena.

\-Checking out the Echo Park neighbourhood.

Everything felt normal until my mom sent me a few videos- my family spending time together, eating, chatting, laughing, dancing without a care. And in that moment, it hit me. In my urge to stand on my own feet and build an independent life, I’ve been away from my hometown, away from my people, for almost seven years. Seven years of missing out on the smallest, most cherished moments.

First, it was for my studies. Then, for my job. And now, I’m thousands of miles away, physically present somewhere else, emotionally split between where I am and where my heart still lives. Even now, I haven’t seriously thought of going back, because my town is small and doesn’t offer many career opportunities. And that makes me wonder, does this mean I may never truly go back?

I know I’m not alone. There are so many people like me, living far from their families, chasing careers, silently carrying this sense of missing out. But knowing that doesn’t make it hurt any less.

It hurts to see my little brother growing up without me.
It hurts knowing my dog still waits for me.
It hurts watching my parents grow older from a distance.
It hurts even more when some relatives no longer recognize me by face.

And then I ask myself- Is this what life is about?

Here’s what I learned.,"For the uninitiated, a turbo shots is one pulled in <20s at \~6 bar (compared to the industry standard 9 bar). The recipe calls for 15g/40g and proponents boast of higher clarity, sweet, repeatable espresso, with somewhat less body than ”traditional“ espresso. Lance did a video if you want to learn more.

I am using a Peruvian medium roast from Costco that has gone a bit stale. At its best I was getting an agreeable traditional shot with a grind setting of 3, 17g/37g, 30-35s with a 10s pre infusion (a note on timing: as per the standard practice, I start the timer the moment I press the button so it includes the pre infusion stage). I WDT by hand and place a puck screen on the tamped puck. I use the stock tamper.

\~Turbo shot (TS) testing\~

I wanted to see if the TS is feasible on the Breville Barista Express (BBE). Taste is not considered (coffee is stale), and I want to see if I can hit the ratio in the time with the pressure.

\-grind setting (GS) 7, 17g/50+g in 30+ s using pre infusion mode only (I never let go of the button). pressure was very low, less than 2 bar. counting this as a fail. after this, I held the button for 3s and then let go for the main pump to kick on.

With the main pump, pressures fell in the 2-4 bar range, though it was difficult to keep track of since the shots are so fast! this is true of all the remaining attempts.

\-GS 7, 15.5g/43g in 16s.

\-GS 6, 15.5g/45g in 20s.

\-GS 7, 15.9/43g in 18s.

\~Conclusions\~  
To me, these are turbo shots. However, the pressure is a bit low, 2-4 bar, while the target was 6 bar. The taste was pretty comparable to the regular shot, maybe a bit watered down is a fair description. Again, the taste was not the goal today. I’m interested to hear what you all have to comment on this. Is low pressure a deal breaker? What would you try next?

However, my brother (M19) and wife (F18) asked if we’d like to move together in an apartment to shorten the costs. I’ve been looking at their dynamic and I’m afraid of what will happen if we agree to living together.

Now, I’ve spoken with various people and have gotten different responses. My parents explained that they’ve been told to leave the house already. They want us to help them out.

But it’s irrational, and unreasonably so. 
He gets a lot of her bad habits from her supplying him, and her being his main parent. I’ve made a point to not doordash, and spend money on things he doesn’t need unless he HAS money TO SPEND. 

unfortunately it’s been a war between us for awhile. I moved out, because I was the primary source his mom sucked on until I left and now she relies on anything she can get her hands on to make rent costs because she makes too much for support pay, and child support on my boyfriend (until he’s 21) doesn’t cut it with her habits of weed, vapes and eating out almost daily and wasting coffee in cups on sinks. but I’m “mean” for pointing it out. She’s moved and broken my items when I lived there, I begged and cried to leave but he said “We won’t be together then” until something bad happened and he was forced to accept it and now it’s “mean and cruel” to of said that.

1qt6g0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthelaw/comments/1qt6g0p/the_beating_of_lawyer_sudine_riley_by_durham/,The beating of lawyer Sudine Riley by Durham Regional Police,"Lawyers routinely work at courthouses after they’ve finished their cases. The courts provide small rooms for them to do this, with a desk and chairs. The courthouses often have a cafeteria, too, or a Tim’s, and after a busy day at court there’s always a lawyer or two or three who grab a coffee and sit in one of those little rooms, catching up on all the work they missed while they were conducting a trial.

On January 23, 2026, Sudine Riley was sitting in a small courthouse office after completing a court appearance. The police found her in that little office, and when they found her, they beat her bloody, and they charged her with trespass. Riley had no right to be in the courthouse, the police claim—no right at all, or at least, not on that day or at that time.

So far Durham Police have not commented on their actions, other than to insist they did everything by the book, while failing to produce the video evidence from the officer’s body cam. They leave it to the rest of us to try to understand why they assaulted a lawyer, dragged her away from her work, handcuffed her, tossed her into a holding cell and slammed her face on a desk.

So let’s fill in the blanks that the police are leaving us to fill in.

Let’s start with race. It is almost unnecessary to state that Sudine Riley is black. This fact pretty well explains it. The police have trouble believing that black people can be lawyers. So do court staff.

When I was a young lawyer, I’d line up with all the other lawyers, waiting to speak to the court clerk or the Crown, signing in and letting the court know what was going on. The clerk or the Crown would say to white lawyers like me, “Who’s your client?”

But when a black lawyer was next in line, the question was different. “What are you charged with?” the clerk or Crown would ask, and the lawyer would have to explain that no, they were not a criminal, but instead a lawyer representing a client. That’s what black lawyers faced in the 90s in the busy courthouse where I practiced law, and in Durham at least, this is still going on.

When the police found Sudine Riley in a lawyer’s interview room, they knew she was trespassing by the colour of her skin. She couldn’t be a lawyer, and besides, she probably gave them attitude by stating her rights. Giving attitude to a cop is like strike one, two and three all in one go. Sudine Riley asserted her rights, so they had to arrest her.

But why the beating? If the police really believed they had to remove Sudine Riley for lawyering while black, why the handcuffs and the violence? Why smash her face into a desk?

The answer is probably this: they have been taught that they will get away with it. They’ve been taught that over and over again, so much so that Durham’s investigation is already closed. Nothing more for them to do. They beat a suspect, and are daring everyone to do something about it.

The Special Investigations Unit opened a file but closed it after about five minutes. Their mandate is to investigate the “serious injury” of people injured by cops. But Sudine Riley was not injured enough, or white enough, and the SIU closed their file.

So now it’s up to the Crown.

The Crown won’t go after the cops, of course; that goes without saying. The Crown never initiates prosecutions of the police. The only issue for the Crown is how it will deal with the trespass charge.

Crowns have discretion not to prosecute, but that’s not how most of them see it. When I practiced criminal law back in the 90s, the Crowns hung out with the cops, partied with the cops. Some of them dated cops. They were on the same team, on the same side.

We’ll find out soon enough whether the Crowns in Durham are independent, or whether they party with cops and are on the same team. We’ll find out when the Crown decides whether or not to proceed with charges against Sudine Riley, for the offence of lawyering while black.",58,1769970657.0,talesfromthelaw,7,0.95,False

The number showed up as unknown and for a second I thought it was a prank.

I was holding our wedding photo when he said it. My hand started shaking so bad the frame nearly slipped.

""Wait,"" I said. ""You didn't know she was married?""

""No,"" he choked out. ""She told me she lived alone. I've been to her apartment downtown probably fifty times. I swear to god I had no idea.""

Apartment downtown. We own a house in the suburbs. Together.

He kept apologizing, saying he felt sick, that he loved her and thought they had a future. He said he only found out because he showed up at her work to surprise her with flowers and saw our wedding photo on her desk - the same one I was holding. He confronted her right there and she admitted everything. Told him to leave. He did, then spent two hours in his car looking me up on social media before he called.

""I'm filing for divorce,"" he said, voice cracking. ""I mean, I know we're not married but I bought a ring last week. I feel like such an idiot.""

""Join the club,"" I said.

We stayed on the phone for almost an hour. Comparing timelines. Matching up her lies. Every business trip, every girls night, every late evening at the office. He had dates. I had dates. They all lined up perfectly. She'd been living two completely separate lives and neither of us had a clue.

He told me his lawyer could have divorce papers ready by tomorrow. I told him mine could too.

Then he said something that made my blood run cold. ""Do you want to serve them together?""

I should have said no. I should have been the bigger person. But I was so angry I couldn't see straight.

""Yeah,"" I said. ""I really do.""

So this morning we met in the parking lot of her office building at 8:45 AM. I'd never seen him before. He was tall, younger than me, holding a manila envelope and looking like he might throw up. I had my own envelope. We didn't shake hands.

""You ready?"" he asked.

""Let's go.""

We walked in together and asked the receptionist for my wife by name. The receptionist looked confused, glanced between us, then made a call. Two minutes later my wife came around the corner and I watched all the color drain from her face.

""What are you doing here?"" she whispered.

""We came to deliver something,"" I said.

Her eyes darted between us. People were starting to notice. One of her coworkers was pretending to look at her computer but obviously watching. My wife's boss had stepped out of his office.

""Not here,"" she hissed. ""Please.""

""Yeah, here,"" the other guy said. His voice was shaking but he handed her his envelope. ""I'm done.""

She took it with trembling hands. Didn't open it.

I held mine out. ""Me too.""

""Baby, please,"" she said, reaching for my arm. ""Can we just talk about this at home?""

""Which home?"" I asked. ""The house we share or the apartment downtown?""

Her hand dropped. Someone gasped.

""You're getting served at the same time because you lied to both of us at the same time,"" I said. ""Seems fair.""

She opened my envelope first. I watched her skim the first page. Her hands were shaking so badly the paper rattled. Then she looked at the other guy.

""You too?"" she asked quietly.

""I bought you a ring,"" he said. ""I was gonna propose next month.""

She actually started crying. Right there in the middle of her office with at least a dozen people watching. Her boss stepped forward and asked if everything was okay. I told him we were just dropping off some paperwork and we'd be leaving.

My wife, soon to be ex-wife, just stood there holding both envelopes while tears ran down her face. She kept looking between us like she couldn't believe this was happening.

""I never meant to hurt anyone,"" she finally said.

""But you did,"" the other guy said. ""For three years.""

We left together. Didn't look back. I could hear her crying as the elevator doors closed.

The other guy and I stood in the parking lot afterward, both of us kind of stunned. He asked if I wanted to grab coffee. I said maybe another time. We shook hands. He said good luck with everything. I said the same.

I drove home and my house felt different. Empty. All her stuff is still here but it doesn't feel like ours anymore. I keep thinking about her face when she saw both of us standing there. The shock. The horror. Part of me feels guilty for humiliating her like that at work.

My brother says I went too far. That serving her publicly was cruel and I should have just done it privately at home like a normal person. My mom agrees. Even my lawyer raised his eyebrows when I told him the plan but didn't try to stop me.

But she lived a double life for three years. And neither of us would have ever known if he hadn't shown up with those flowers.

AITA for serving her divorce papers at work with the guy she was cheating on me with?

I wasn't asking it to think for me. I was asking it to execute.

It turns out the pain of the first two hours is what sets the direction for the day.

1qt6ejh,https://www.reddit.com/r/exvegans/comments/1qt6ejh/peter_singers_shallow_pond_thought_experiment/,Peter Singers shallow pond thought experiment destroys vegan ethics,"To those unfamiliar Peter singers shallow pond idea goes as follows,

Imagine you’re walking by a small pond and you see a child struggling in the water. You could  and save them easily, but your clothes  or new shoes would get muddy and/or you’d be late to your next appointment. Most people would say, of course you should jump in, the cost to you is small compared to the child’s life.
Singer uses this to make us think about global suffering. He asks: if it’s clear that you can prevent serious harm or even death for someone far away, like by donating to an effective charity, and it doesn’t cost you anything of comparable importance, aren’t you morally obligated to act? 

Now we look to first world privileges, the cost of that cup of coffee you bought could of went to a charity that hosts vaccines for children in third world countries.  Or, that pair of headphones or netflix subscription could of gone to a meal for a starving child. The bystander effect can not apply here, as it wouldn't apply if those stood around you watching a child drown. 

The thing with vegan ethics is they focus on the low cost to individuals vs the high cost to animals (their lifespan resulting in a ""needless"" chicken nugget) but I'd argue that vegans do not truely hold this position. No one does. It's moral soapboxing. Vegans like earthling ED and others,  highlight that this system of animal exploitation and suffering would stop if we just did what was in our power to give up our pleasantries.  

This can tie back to ""no ethical consumption"" and ties back to if consumption (besides bare necessities) at all is ethical. Child labor, pollution,  slavery, etc still produce our goods. And even shopping local, unless the materials are local it will always track back to some unethical resource. 

I remember watching seaspirecy, the vegan documentary highlighting the unethical fish industry and them talking about slavery on fishing boats. That's cruel and should be done without, but your cellphone somehow isn't? Unless you get everything second hand i dont see an ethical arguement. A lot of phones are built with slave labor or child labor. Not to mention fast fashion. ",10,1769970578.0,exvegans,12,0.92,False
1qt6dqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawCanada/comments/1qt6dqy/the_beating_of_lawyer_sudine_riley_by_durham/,The beating of lawyer Sudine Riley by Durham Regional Police,"Lawyers routinely work at courthouses after they’ve finished their cases. The courts provide small rooms for them to do this, with a desk and chairs. The courthouses often have a cafeteria, too, or a Tim’s, and after a busy day at court there’s always a lawyer or two or three who grab a coffee and sit in one of those little rooms, catching up on all the work they missed while they were conducting a trial.

On January 23, 2026, Sudine Riley was sitting in a small courthouse office after completing a court appearance. The police found her in that little office, and when they found her, they beat her bloody, and they charged her with trespass. Riley had no right to be in the courthouse, the police claim—no right at all, or at least, not on that day or at that time.

So far Durham Police have not commented on their actions, other than to insist they did everything by the book, while failing to produce the video evidence from the officer’s body cam. They leave it to the rest of us to try to understand why they assaulted a lawyer, dragged her away from her work, handcuffed her, tossed her into a holding cell and slammed her face on a desk.

So let’s fill in the blanks that the police are leaving us to fill in.

Let’s start with race. It is almost unnecessary to state that Sudine Riley is black. This fact pretty well explains it. The police have trouble believing that black people can be lawyers. So do court staff.

When I was a young lawyer, I’d line up with all the other lawyers, waiting to speak to the court clerk or the Crown, signing in and letting the court know what was going on. The clerk or the Crown would say to white lawyers like me, “Who’s your client?”

But when a black lawyer was next in line, the question was different. “What are you charged with?” the clerk or Crown would ask, and the lawyer would have to explain that no, they were not a criminal, but instead a lawyer representing a client. That’s what black lawyers faced in the 90s in the busy courthouse where I practiced law, and in Durham at least, this is still going on.

When the police found Sudine Riley in a lawyer’s interview room, they knew she was trespassing by the colour of her skin. She couldn’t be a lawyer, and besides, she probably gave them attitude by stating her rights. Giving attitude to a cop is like strike one, two and three all in one go. Sudine Riley asserted her rights, so they had to arrest her.

But why the beating? If the police really believed they had to remove Sudine Riley for lawyering while black, why the handcuffs and the violence? Why smash her face into a desk?

The answer is probably this: they have been taught that they will get away with it. They’ve been taught that over and over again, so much so that Durham’s investigation is already closed. Nothing more for them to do. They beat a suspect, and are daring everyone to do something about it.

The Special Investigations Unit opened a file but closed it after about five minutes. Their mandate is to investigate the “serious injury” of people injured by cops. But Sudine Riley was not injured enough, or white enough, and the SIU closed their file.

So now it’s up to the Crown.

The Crown won’t go after the cops, of course; that goes without saying. The Crown never initiates prosecutions of the police. The only issue for the Crown is how it will deal with the trespass charge.

Crowns have discretion not to prosecute, but that’s not how most of them see it. When I practiced criminal law back in the 90s, the Crowns hung out with the cops, partied with the cops. Some of them dated cops. They were on the same team, on the same side.

We’ll find out soon enough whether the Crowns in Durham are independent, or whether they party with cops and are on the same team. We’ll find out when the Crown decides whether or not to proceed with charges against Sudine Riley, for the offence of lawyering while black.",61,1769970532.0,LawCanada,16,0.84,False

* **Rapid prototyping:** Choose any cell size and chemistry (including custom voltage ranges) and instantly see the electrical *and* physical characteristics of the finished pack. This makes it easy to check whether it fits your enclosure and can drive your load at both full and empty charge.
* **Material estimation:** Estimates how much nickel strip you’ll need, so you don’t come up short or massively overbuy.
* **3D / exploded views:** Helps visualise multi-layer packs. (Some complex routing cases aren’t implemented yet, so always sanity-check current paths.)
* **Comparison matrix:** Save multiple configs (e.g. 10S4P vs 12S3P) and compare them side-by-side. It automatically highlights the best option for things like cost, weight, volume, and power.

1qt6b25,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12916-025-04481-5,"Is This the Secret to a Younger Heart? Why Tea, Coffee, and Berries Might Be Your Cardiovascular Life Insurance","\*\*The Core Issue\*\*

While we’ve always been told ""plants are good for you,"" it’s actually incredibly hard for scientists to prove how much plant compounds (polyphenols) we consume and how they directly impact our hearts over decades. Most studies rely on people remembering what they ate, which is notoriously inaccurate. This study aimed to bridge that gap by using both long-term dietary tracking and objective urine tests to see if a polyphenol-rich diet actually moves the needle on heart disease risk.

\*\*The Finding\*\*

Researchers discovered a clear, consistent link: people who stuck to a (poly)phenol-rich diet had significantly lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk scores. Specifically, higher adherence was associated with lower ""HeartScores"" and ""ASCVD"" scores, which predict your risk of heart attack or stroke over the next 10 years. Interestingly, the study found that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or ""good"" cholesterol was higher in those with a polyphenol-rich metabolism.

\*\*Why it Matters\*\*

Cardiovascular risk naturally increases as we age, but this research suggests that a diet high in polyphenols can actually slow down that progression. It provides some of the strongest evidence yet that common dietary habits—like drinking tea or coffee and eating whole fruits—aren't just neutral habits; they are active tools for cardiovascular longevity.

\*\*Limitations of Study\*\*

The study cohort was 96.7% female and 99% white, meaning the results might not perfectly translate to more diverse populations. Additionally, the food questionnaires used didn't include some heavy hitters like blueberries, and the researchers used ""spot"" urine samples rather than 24-hour collections, which can sometimes miss the full picture of a person's metabolism.

\*\*Conflicting Interests\*\*

The authors of the study declared that they have no competing interests.

\*\*Interesting Statistics\*\*

The study followed 3,110 participants for an average of over 11 years. They found that a simple 10-unit increase in a person’s polyphenol diet score was associated with a massive 8.5% reduction in their ASCVD risk score. Also, coffee and tea were the heavy lifters, accounting for roughly 80% of the total polyphenol intake for the participants.

\*\*Useful Takeaways\*\*

Focus on ""The Big Three"" for polyphenols: coffee, tea, and red wine (in moderation). Beyond beverages, the study highlighted onions, peppers, garlic, nuts, whole grains, and berries as key heart-protectors. Crucially, the researchers noted that whole fruits are much better than fruit juices; juices often lose their fiber and have higher sugar bioavailability, which can actually cancel out some of the benefits.

TL;DR: Science confirms that a diet packed with tea, coffee, berries, and nuts significantly lowers your 10-year risk of heart attack and stroke, potentially slowing down the ""aging"" of your cardiovascular system.",15,1769970383.0,microbiomenews,0,0.95,False

The filtration is strong — my tap water tastes cleaner and smoother, with far less chlorine and other off-flavors. I can actually drink straight from the tap now without grimacing, and I feel better knowing it’s removing more contaminants.

Installation was quick and hassle-free. The instructions were clear, and I didn’t need any special tools. The filter fits snugly and feels solidly built, not like a flimsy add-on. Replacing the filters has also been easy and straightforward — the cartridges snap in without a struggle and the change-out reminder is useful so I don’t forget.

Since using the Boroux filter, I’ve noticed my coffee and cooking taste better too. The water really does make a difference when it’s cleaner. For the price point, this feels like a great balance of performance and value.

* **Timeframes matter** — a move that looks wild on a 5-minute chart might be nothing on the daily.
* I’m starting to see that **support and resistance** are basically areas where price tends to chill or get rejected.
* Big moves usually make more sense when you **zoom out first**, instead of panicking on the lower timeframes.

No indicators overload yet. Mostly just trying to **read price instead of guessing**.

But I am worried and afraid it may happen again it was very scary moment. Today I was not particularly worried about anything, I had a cup of coffee which I don’t usually have the last weeks and I don’t know of that was the reason. Have any of you expected something similar?",1,1769970011.0,Heartpalpitations,2,1.0,False
1qt62it,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1qt62it/the_art_of_flirting_with_women_what_actually/,The Art of Flirting with Women: What Actually Works (Science-Based),"Flirting is one of those skills nobody teaches you, yet everyone expects you to know. I've spent the last year deep-diving into this through books, research papers, podcasts with relationship experts, and honestly, a lot of trial and error. What I found isn't some pickup artist BS or manipulation tactics. It's about understanding human psychology, social dynamics, and why most guys get this completely wrong.

The biggest misconception? Thinking flirting is about witty lines or being someone you're not. It's not. Flirting is fundamentally about creating a safe space for mutual attraction to surface. Most advice out there focuses on ""what to say"" when the real game is about energy, timing, and reading social cues. Society doesn't help either, we're bombarded with rom-com scripts and alpha male nonsense that makes genuine connection feel like rocket science.

**Start with genuine curiosity, not an agenda.** The fastest way to kill attraction is walking up with an outcome in mind. Women can smell desperation from a mile away. Instead, approach conversations with authentic interest. Ask questions that go beyond small talk. Not ""what do you do"" but ""what's something you're genuinely excited about right now?"" This sounds simple but it's rare. Dr. Arthur Aron's research at Stony Brook University showed that asking progressively more personal questions creates intimacy faster than months of surface-level chat. The key is reciprocal vulnerability, you share a bit, she shares a bit, and suddenly you're having a real conversation instead of an interview.

**Playful teasing is your friend, but know the line.** Light teasing creates tension in a good way. It shows confidence and breaks the overly-polite barrier most people hide behind. But there's a massive difference between playful and mean. Good teasing is observational and comes from a place of liking someone. ""You seem like the type who orders the most complicated coffee drink possible"" is playful. Anything about appearance, intelligence, or insecurities? Hard pass. Esther Perel talks about this brilliantly in her podcast ""Where Should We Begin?"" She explains that flirtation lives in the space between the known and unknown, it's about creating intrigue without making someone feel unsafe.

**Body language matters more than your words.** UCLA research found that communication is 55% body language, 38% tone, and only 7% actual words. If you're saying the right things but your body screams discomfort, you've already lost. Maintain relaxed eye contact, not staring but genuine looking. Angle your body toward her. Use open gestures. Mirror her energy, if she's leaning in, you lean in. If she's pulling back, give space. The app Ash is actually solid for practicing social awareness and understanding emotional cues if you struggle with reading body language. It's designed as a relationship coach but the modules on non-verbal communication are insanely practical.

**Compliment her choices, not just her appearance.** Every woman hears ""you're beautiful"" seventeen times a day. It barely registers. What does land? ""That's a really interesting book choice"" or ""I love how passionate you get when talking about that."" You're noticing her as a person with agency and taste, not just a pretty face. This comes from research by social psychologist Dr. Robert Cialdini, people are drawn to those who appreciate their authentic selves rather than surface-level attributes. It signals you're paying attention to who she actually is.

**Create opportunities for touch, but read the room.** Touch escalation is real but it has to be natural and consensual. Start with socially acceptable touches, a light touch on the arm when making a point, guiding her through a doorway with a hand on her lower back. Gauge her response. If she leans into it or reciprocates, that's a green light to continue. If she pulls away or seems uncomfortable, back off immediately. No questions asked. The book The Like Switch by Jack Schafer, former FBI agent, breaks down the psychology of building rapport and trust. Schafer spent his career getting criminals to trust him, the principles apply everywhere. This book made me rethink everything about how trust is built through small, consistent signals. Insanely good read if you want to understand human behavior at a fundamental level.

**Actually listen.** This sounds obvious but most people are just waiting for their turn to talk. Active listening means processing what she's saying and building on it, not just nodding while planning your next story. Reference things she mentioned earlier in the conversation. ""Wait, you said you were into ceramics, have you made anything recently?"" Women notice when you're genuinely engaged versus performing engagement. Researcher Sherry Turkle's work on conversation shows that true listening is becoming rare, which makes it incredibly valuable when someone actually does it.

For anyone looking to go deeper on relationship psychology and social dynamics but struggling to find time for all these books and research, there's an app called BeFreed that might help. Built by a team from Columbia and former Google AI experts, it pulls from resources like the books mentioned above, relationship experts, and research papers to create personalized audio content based on specific goals. Type something like ""learn to be more confident and magnetic as an introvert in dating situations"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan with episodes you can customize from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with detailed examples. The voice options are surprisingly engaging, there's even a smoky, sarcastic narrator that makes the content way more listenable during commutes or at the gym. What stands out is how it tailors the material to address unique struggles rather than generic advice. Worth checking out if connecting these concepts into a clear path forward feels overwhelming.

**Know when to walk away.** Not every interaction will lead somewhere and that's fine. If she's giving one-word answers, constantly checking her phone, or explicitly saying she's not interested, take the L gracefully. ""Hey, it was nice chatting with you"" and exit. This isn't rejection of your entire being, it's just not the right moment or person. The Youtube channel Charisma on Command has great breakdowns on reading disinterest signals before they become awkward. They analyze social dynamics from movies and real interactions, makes it way easier to spot patterns.

**Confidence isn't loudness.** Quiet confidence is magnetic. It's being comfortable with silence, not needing to fill every gap with words. It's maintaining your sense of humor when things don't go perfectly. It's being okay with rejection because you know your worth isn't determined by one person's interest. This is the hardest part but also the most important. If you're not in a good place with yourself, all the techniques in the world won't help. Work on building a life you're genuinely excited about, hobbies, friendships, growth. That energy is what people are actually attracted to.

The real skill isn't learning to flirt with women, it's learning to be someone worth flirting with. That means becoming comfortable with yourself, developing genuine interests, and treating interactions as opportunities to connect rather than transactions to win. When you shift that mindset, everything else falls into place naturally.",1,1769969887.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

Requirements (must be explicit): brew multiple coffee types/sizes (≤2 min), touch UI response <1s, secure payment (≤5s), real-time maintenance alerts, temperature accuracy ±2°C per drink.

Core entities: CoffeeMachine (status, temp, ingredientLevels), UserInterface (options display + input), PaymentSystem (methods, transaction), CoffeeType (brewTime, tempRequirement, sizes), MaintenanceAlert (type/message/time), Operator (manages machines).

Relationships: Machine has 1 UI + 1 PaymentSystem; Machine supports many CoffeeTypes and emits many MaintenanceAlerts; Operator receives alerts from many machines.

APIs (keep them crisp):
- POST /coffeeMachine/{id}/brew {coffeeType,size}
- GET /coffeeMachine/{id}/options
- POST /paymentSystem/{id}/process {amount,method,currency}
- GET /coffeeMachine/{id}/alerts
- PUT /coffeeMachine/{id}/ingredients
- POST /coffeeMachine/{id}/temperature {coffeeType}

Key flows: select → validate ingredients/temp → pay → brew → update UI; alerts trigger on low ingredients/cleaning.

Discuss trade-offs: monolith vs microservices, security vs UX, real-time alerts vs cost. Cover failures: network loss (offline cache/retry), payment downtime (fallback + reconciliation), hardware/UI/temp failures (watchdog, redundancy).
