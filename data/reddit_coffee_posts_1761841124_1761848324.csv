i used to think it was bills but after i started tracking my spending on walletwize, i realized i just spend without thinking. like coffee, doordash, amazon, snacks, random gas station stuff.

when you add it all up it’s kinda depressing.

trying to actually be better now and give myself a weekly limit. it’s crazy how you can make decent money and still feel broke.

1ok7bby,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ok7bby,Liminal Shroud Demo Now Live on Steam and Itch.io,"Hey r/IndieGames!

I just hit publish for the **Liminal Shroud Demo** on **Steam** and Itchio and now I'm stuck between realities. Send snacks...

**What is it?**  
Imagine waking up in a dream where your memories are scrambled, the furniture judges you silently, and the puzzles are smarter than you. That’s Liminal Shroud. It’s a vibes-driven, atmospheric mystery where you explore surreal spaces, solve puzzles, and try not to question your own reality too hard.

**Why should you play it?**

* Because your heart deserves a workout
* Because the soundtrack slaps (in a moody, existential way)
* Because puzzles are cheaper than therapy
* Because I made it with love, coffee, and way too many sticky notes

I’d love your feedback, bug reports, or just general existential musings. And if you like what you see, hit that wishlist button on Steam like it owes you money.

1ok76tb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ok76tb/a_very_pink_and_slightly_bloody_halloween/,A very pink and slightly bloody Halloween,"“Hold still, Haasha!” Skylar said with irritation.

“Are you sure about this? I feel ridiculous,” I responded as she smeared more red goop into my fur.

“Don’t you remember what Erika and I did to Takara?” she asked.

“The scars and makeup were pretty funny,” I conceded. “And according to a message from Auggie, the eye patch was also appropriately pirate-like.”

“Right!” She said as she gave me a firm nod. “And how well did it all work out in the end?”

“He helped get past all the stupid bureaucracy just by standing around and looking grumpy,” I admitted.

“So, trust me!” she said with a large grin. “This will be a great look! And we’re in the Terran Embassy, so everybody will understand what’s going on.”

I sighed and let her do her thing. She spent the next five minutes putting the thick red liquid called fake blood all around my mouth, and then she covered the fur on my hands and wrists. I looked like I had just pigged out on a strawberry or raspberry pie, except the color was a bit darker and a perfect match to human blood.

“This isn’t going to stain my fur, right? I like my natural shade of pink over this ugly dark red and I’ll look ridiculous if this doesn’t come out,” I grumbled.

“I already checked! Guaranteed not to stain hair or fur of any species. Washes out with just soap and water. Harmless if consumed,” she responded while pointing at text on the tube of fake blood. “Now stop worrying, and let’s go down to the party in the conference room. The first batch of kids just got here for trick or treat, so it’s time for you to make your Halloween debut!”

We headed down the back stairs to get to the rear entrance of the conference room. Skylar swiped her security badge to open the door and held it open just enough to peer inside at the festivities.

“Here they come!” she whispered with excitement. “Get ready, and… GO!”

“Growl-owl-owl-roaaaar<shrieeeeeek>!” I bellowed out at the top of my lungs as I stepped into the room and stomped towards the kids. 

There was silence as the kids stood there and stared at me. Then, one of them dropped their candy bucket and it spilled all over the floor. That seemed to be the tipping point.

All 18 little kids started screaming, running away, and calling out for their mommy or daddy. None of the adults in the room were laughing. As a matter of fact, they looked about as pissed as First Officer Auggie when I had knocked his first coffee of the day out of his hand.

That incident got me scrubbing toilets for an entire day as punishment, and it was just over one spilled cup of coffee. My stomach churned as I wondered how a room full of angry human parents would respond.

“Well,” Skylar said as she looked at the chaos. “That was definitely not what I expected to happen.”

Two minutes later, security dragged us up to the Terran Ambassador’s office. 10 minutes after that, the Ambassador burst through the door in green face paint and a classic black witch costume complete with an extra pointy hat.

“What do you have to say for yourselves?” She demanded as she put her hands on her hips.

“It's my first Halloween,” I said meekly. “I thought you were supposed to dress up and be scary.”

“Do you realize if you had just showed up with a bucket of candy, you would have gotten free massages all night long?” she asked in an exasperated tone.

“Really?” I said dumbly.

“Yes!” the Ambassador exclaimed before explaining. “Kids would have wondered if you were a person in a costume and gone bonkers when they discovered you’re real! It would have been mind-blowing and exciting for them to meet a cute, fuzzy sapient that loves scritches and looks like a cartoon dinosaur. We would have needed pry bars to get them off you.”

I glared at Skylar. A night of free massages blown to bits? The value of the treat lost far exceeded anything gained by us tricking the kids. 

“Even better, the next time one of the kids saw a Py’rapt’ch, they would have gone nuts to learn it really wasn’t a Halloween trick and furry space dinosaurs truly do exist!” she finished while shaking her head in disappointment.

“I’m truly sorry. I was just trying to fit in and participate in my first Halloween,” was all I could say in response. In the back of my head, I began to wonder if I had just committed the first significant Py’rapt’ch - Human diplomatic incident in galactic history.

“And you, Skylar! Are you insane?” the Ambassador said in an accusatory tone as she whirled to glare at my companion. “The look would have been perfect for the adults-only party tonight, but for little kids? How on Earth did you think it was appropriate? You took a furry pink space dinosaur and turned her into a homicidal flesh-eating monster. How many cute and fun things did you just ruin for those kids?”

“Well…” Skylar started to try to defend herself, but the ambassador cut her off.

“Let’s take a quick look, shall we? I’m sure it’s not that bad. You only ruined a few things for them,” the Ambassador said sarcastically before raising her voice to thunderous levels you could probably hear clearly three rooms away. “Furry things? Check. Pink? Nothing I can think of in human history that’s pink and typically seen by kids has ever been scary. Strange, silly, or stupid? Sure. Scary? Never. Dinosaurs? Kids love them. It’s OK in monster movies for a dinosaur to try to eat people, but a furry, pink, easily-confused-for-a-cartoon space dinosaur?”

“I thought it would be funny…” Skylar mumbled while looking incredibly sheepish.

“Do you have any idea how many years of therapy the two of you have caused those poor kids?” the Ambassador roared at her.

“So… Um. Maybe this is too soon, but perhaps we can clean Haasha up and try some exposure therapy?” Skylar responded while smiling hopefully and pointing at me. “We could even find a pair of tighty-whities, cut a hole in the back for her tail, and have her wear that to look super silly and non-threatening!”

1ok766w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Voicesofthevoid/comments/1ok766w/09_spoiler_warnings_some_thoughts_about_the/,(0.9 SPOILER WARNINGS) Some thoughts about the update. (it's awesome),"I'm directing this post mainly to those who are curious about the changes but haven't managed to download the new version yet. Perhaps it's better to wait a bit longer and see for yourself, but curiosity wins out... Enjoy my opinion.

I'll start by saying I know about the instability of this version and I couldn't care less. Go ahead, delete System 32, I dare you.

I've been playing for about three hours and I have to say, this update makes me wonder if this is even the same game anymore. Generally speaking, most things are a huge plus!

1. New Controls. They were hard to get used to, but I honestly think they are better. Once you overcome the muscle memory, it's so much more comfortable! This is especially noticeable when, for example, you're packing trash, because the interface doesn't keep clicking you onto a different option. A massive plus overall!
2. THE NEW DRONE! I love it. The item box is no longer needed because the drone has an infinite inventory and you can load it up to your heart's content. Everything you can carry in your hands (even if it's too heavy for Kel) can be packed and sold. Best change of all, IMO. The downside is that there are still pieces of furniture you can't sell (e.g., the cafeteria couch), but on the bright side, you can get rid of those green bins. Wonderful.
3. New Crafting Table. You still craft the same way (i.e., you put everything on the table), so trash still falls on the floor, but everything happens via the interface now. It's harder to accidentally craft gas cans when you're spamming inputs. Great!
4. New Lab. What more is there to say? It looks gorgeous. The microwave is downstairs. You can carry the bed away.
5. Main Terminal and Transformers. Scanning now requires more effort, which I think is a plus, because you can't just upgrade the sensor speed and ignore it anymore. The transformer mini-games are meh, but it's cool that they involve more than just ""press the red button."" The best change is probably the fact that you have to upgrade the computer yourself! (I recommend turning it off first, lmaooo)
6. You can upgrade the ATV. Why isn't this game on Steam yet? Seriously, that's the only thing that was missing.

Overall, immersion and quality of life have gone up. The new lab is wonderful (the coffee machine!!!). Honestly, it's hard to believe how many changes this game has undergone since version 0.5. I am extremely impressed. Now it's time for me to go back.

Okay so me and a friend whom I personally talk about manifesting and about consciousness and reality were just discussing about how it works. She was still skeptical about it and so I tried to make her understand. 

Our talk was about experiencing ""blackout"" today (yes very weird) I was like ""if anything is possible, and then you can ask anything"" randomly I just use blockout as an example (because  it was the first stupid thing my mind came up)😂 so i told her, manifesting is instant. You can even manifest a blockout today if you want.

A few hours later in the afternoon, we forgot about our conversation, it just so happens when the electricity went out that we remembered ""hey werent we talking about blockouts this morning????"" Me and her were so amazed and shocked. It never blackout on Thursdays!!! So I myself was still shocked. 

Question is, why is it that easy to manifest something like that??? But not the important things like money or love?

My revelation is that we put meaning or value on things. I think the more important, the more struggle to get it. For those like me who put so much importance on material objects and with limiting beliefs, I suggest decreasing importance of money and reducing its value like it were like a ""blackout"" 

Like it's just free coffee or free food u usually receive

This is probably where law if assumption comes in. U just assume money or love or anything u desire is unimportant and so YOUR LOGICAL BRAIN WILL BELIEVE it's easy to have it. ✨

Edit: Law of Assumption is assuming it's already yours. I know. But my logical brain says otherwise. I realized it needs proof all the time 😭 so this is how I use it. Bye.",1,1761847721.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False
1ok733k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ok733k/the_dog_by_the_door/,The Dog by the Door...,"Morning

I wake to the sound of paws on the floorboards.

“Max, bitte…” I mumble into the pillow. It’s too bright already; the thin curtains can’t hold back the Berlin sun. My head is pounding. I shouldn’t have had that last beer.

Max’s nails click closer. Then a wet nose presses against my cheek, a low whine that means breakfast or walk, choose one.

“Alright, alright, you tyrant.”

I swing my legs over the bed, feel the cold wood, and instantly regret existing. The apartment smells faintly of coffee grounds and dog fur, the two constants of my life. Posters peel from the walls, Freiheit für Tiere!, Science ≠ Suffering! my idealism laminated in cheap ink. A half-finished protest sign leans in the corner beside an old cactus.

I shuffle toward the bathroom. The handle sticks, as always.

“Verdammte… push, come on” using my strength i lean in and with enough effort It gives with a sharp creak.

Then I’m on my knees, retching for the toilet but then i gag up foam and acid. I miss. It splashes on the tile. “Scheiße.”

Max watches from the doorway, ears tilted, confused sympathy in his eyes. “Don’t look at me like that.” I grab paper towels, mop up, dump everything in the bin, rinse my mouth, and smile at the ridiculousness of it all.

Coffee first. Then redemption.

The Message

By the time the caffeine hits, I feel almost human again. I scroll through my phone.
There it is the encrypted chat Green Vein.
Anja: Tonight. 22:00. Tiergarten station. Bring gloves.

Beneath it: a link Novaprax Biotechnik leaked documents.

I open the file. Scans of research memos, grant proposals, photos of white corridors. One phrase repeats: “Behavioural Control via Selective Aggression & Passivity Modulation in Mammalia.”

I mutter, “Selective aggression, my ass.”

They call it pest control, population management. We call it cruelty.

Max noses my knee, demanding attention. “You’d hate them too, huh?”

He yawns. I laugh. I scroll further rumors about trials on stray dogs in Brandenburg. That hits harder than it should.

Outside, trams rattle by. Berlin hums, indifferent. I sip cold coffee and think about Anja’s last voice message: “We just need proof. People listen when they see cages.”

Tonight, we’ll break in. Photograph everything. Leave. No damage. Just truth.

At least, that’s the plan.


---

Afternoon

The sun burns pale gold through clouds. I clip Max’s leash, pocket my earbuds, and step outside.

It’s one of those perfect days... warm, breezy, alive. Kids chase pigeons near the canal; an old man sells strawberries by the bridge. For a moment, the world feels exactly right.

We cut through Tiergarten. The air smells of rain and grass. Max bounds ahead, tail flagging. I throw a stick; he sprints after it, tongue lolling, pure joy.

A woman with a dachshund smiles at me. “Er ist sehr brav.”

“He tries.”

She laughs, moves on. I watch Max wrestle the stick out of a puddle, proud of his triumph. It hits me how much I love this stupid dog. He’s my family, my roommate, my sanity, the only kumpel that truly understands me.

As we walk home, he shakes off water all over my jeans. I groan. “Unbelievable.” He looks smug. I scratch his head anyway.

For a heartbeat I think: maybe skip tonight. Maybe stay home. But then I remember those lab photos, the tags on animal ears. Someone has to care.


---

Night

Rain starts as I leave. It patters soft against my hood, misting the empty streets.

The Tiergarten station glows dimly, reflected in puddles. Six of us wait beneath the bridge with Anja and Felix standing together, two students I don’t know, a wiry man named Leo who brought the tools.

No one talks much. Only the rain and the low hiss of car tires on wet asphalt.

We drive east, past the city lights, into the dark countryside. Brandenburg’s flat fields stretch forever. Windmills turn like ghosts.

The facility rises from the fog, cold, concrete, sterile, ringed with fences. No guards visible. Just floodlights and cameras.

Leo cuts the wire with a hiss. We crawl through, hearts hammering. Inside: warehouses, shipping crates, ventilation ducts breathing steam.

A keypad door yields to Felix’s stolen code. Cold fluorescent light washes over us.

At first, we didn’t even know what we were looking at. The room was lined with cages, floor to ceiling, but not the kind you’d expect from an abuse exposé. Everything gleamed under white fluorescent lights. Stainless steel, spotless floors, filtered air humming quietly from vents above.

Inside the cages were monkeys, capuchins, a few macaques just watching us with steady, unblinking eyes. Their fur was clean. They had food. Water. Even toys.

It was unnerving, how calm they were.

I stepped closer to one of them, crouched until we were eye level. He didn’t shrink back, didn’t show a single flinch of fear. Just blinked at me, slow, deliberate, like he understood that I shouldn’t be here.

“No trauma response,” I muttered, frowning. “That doesn’t make sense.”

Felix’s voice pulled us away. He’d found a terminal still glowing green in the corner, stacks of printed notes scattered beside it. The paper rustled as he flipped through. His expression changed, first confusion, then a flash of alarm.

“These apes aren’t the test subjects,” he said, his voice suddenly low, tense. “They’re controls. Baseline samples to make sure there’s no risk of primate infection symptoms.”

“What?” Elke asked.

He swallowed. “They’re testing something they already know doesn’t affect us. Humans. Primates. That’s why these ones look so... fine.”

A chill crept down my spine.

At the far end of the room, a set of clear PVC strip curtains swayed gently in the recycled air. A rhythmic mechanical hum pulsed beyond them, steady, rhythmic, like a heartbeat amplified through metal.

I didn’t wait for anyone else. I just ran.

The plastic strips slapped against my shoulders as I burst through and then froze.

Rows. Endless rows of cages, each lit by cold surgical lamps. Rabbits. Raccoons. Dogs. All sedated, motionless, their chests rising shallowly. Tubes threaded into veins, monitors flashing tiny green heartbeats. Charts hung from clipboards, each stamped with a single block code: RFX.

Anja’s whisper trembled. “Take pictures. Fast.”

My hands shook as I pulled out my phone. Through the camera lens, the world looked even more wrong. The sterile white light, the gleam of steel, the limp bodies breathing because machines told them to.

A red-taped door stood at the back, the paint chipped where someone had scraped at it. RFX: Mammal Behaviour Control Trials.

Otto adjusted his glasses, eyes darting over the cages. “There’s only mammals here... why?”

Elke pressed her hand to her mouth, her voice breaking. “What the hell is this?”

The machines just kept humming.

And for the first time I realized we weren’t here to uncover abuse. We were standing in the middle of something that wasn’t supposed to exist.

Before anyone answers, Leo smashes the lock. The door swings open.

Inside, glass cylinders filled with pale fluid hum like beehives. The air smells metallic, sharp. Screens blink with genetic code.

Anja lifts her camera. Flash.

Something bursts, a pipe as the nozzle came loose a mist of red vapor sprays across us. My eyes sting; I cough violently.

“Scheiße! Back out! Back out! This it the real thing!”

Alarms blare. Red lights strobe.

We scatter, crashing into corridors, slipping on wet tiles. I grab the railing, slick with the same reddish residue. My glove tears.

Outside, rain slaps my face. We run through mud, headlights flashing in the distance, most definitely security or even police.

By the time I reach the car, my lungs burn. My jacket sticks to my skin.

We split up at the city limits. I take the U-Bahn home alone, still trembling, the smell of iron in my nose.


---

Home

The apartment feels unreal, too small, too quiet for my racing mind.

But then Max barks once, joyous. He jumps up, paws on my chest. I hug him, half-crying, half-laughing. “You won’t believe the day I had.”

I toss my soaked jacket and gloves in a heap by the door. I’ll wash them tomorrow.

Shower first. The water runs pink as the rain. I tell myself it’s dye, nothing more.

When I step out, the mirror fogs over. My skin tingles faintly, but I chalk it up to nerves.

Max is sniffing the jacket pile, whining softly. “Hey, don’t chew that,” I warn, nudging him away. He obeys, tail wagging uncertainly.

I pour cereal, eat standing up. My eyes sting from exhaustion.

“Good night, Max,” I murmur, patting his head. He licks my fingers, then pads to his blanket by the door.

I collapse onto the bed and drift.


---

The Sound

Scratching.

At first it folds into the dream, leaves on a window, wind through branches.

Then louder. Rhythmic. Wood against metal.

I open my eyes. The room is black except for the faint LED glow of the alarm clock. 3:42 a.m.

“Max?”

No answer.

The scratching comes again, from the hallway. Then a low growl, wet, guttural, unfamiliar...

I sit up, heart thudding. “Max, was ist los?”

Something bumps the bedroom door. A soft whine. Then silence.

I get up slowly, bare feet on cold floor, and reach for the handle.


---

The Dog

“Max, are you—”

The door cracks open.

He’s crouched there, shoulders twitching, chest heaving. His fur clings damp to his body, eyes red and swollen, pupils tiny pinpoints. Drool hangs in ropes from his mouth.

For a second I freeze, thinking he’s sick, poisoned maybe. “Oh, Gott, Max, what happened—”

He lunges.

The door slams into my arm; teeth close on skin. Pain flares, hot and bright. I scream and shove, catching the edge of the frame. Blood sprays.

He thrashes, snarling, forcing his way through the gap. I slam the door again, but his strength is unreal.

“Stop! Max, stop!”

He doesn’t hear. He doesn’t even blink.

I break free, stumble backward through the kitchen. My arm is dripping. The tiles blur.

He charges, claws skittering, jaws snapping. I grab a chair and swing it. Wood splinters against his flank. He yelps, then growls deeper, madder.

“Please, Max…” My voice cracks.

He circles, panting, eyes locked on me like prey.


---

The Bathroom!

The only door that locks, the bathroom...

I dash for it, lungs burning. My blood leaves streaks on the wall.

Behind me, the crash of claws, the hiss of breath, rabid barking i had only seen on gore site videos or rabies documentaries.

I barley shut the rotten passage way door as Max smashed against it with predatory fury.

I reach the handle. It sticks.

“No, no, not now.”

I press down, but my fingers tremble. The metal feels slick. The lever barely moves.

I shove harder with all my might, shoulder against the frame. Nothing.

He hits the door; it jolts. The wood cracks.

I try again, but my arm gives out, the bitten one. Numb now. Weak.

I sob, pushing with all I have. The handle still won’t budge as i collapse, my legs giving way.

The door groans once more, then splinters inward.

Something heavy slams into me.


---

The Mauling

I instantly feel excruciating pain as my once best friend bites into me like a crocodilian during a death roll an agonizing buring sensation all throughout my body, spreading fast. The world shrinks to noise: claws, snarls, my own heartbeat drumming out as i gradually lose the strength... freedom to move as if the venom of a komodo dragon is coursing through my veins.

The hall light flickers. The rusted handle of the bathroom gleams dully, my hand twitching as Max feasts upon me as his last supper.

I think of Tiergarten, of sunlight and grass, of Max rolling on his back while children laughed.

Then there’s only dark.

I still had hope since the shipping label said an espresso machine was inside but sure enough, it was a random shark vacuum cleaner.

When I called customer service the lady said it didn’t sound right and was super skeptical. She claimed someone with my address and email already started the warranty which made no sense seeing I don’t even have an espresso machine, I have a vacuum cleaner.

After seeing the pictures she said she would escalate the situation and I would hear back in 24 hours (I never did) and that they would determine if they could do an exchange. She also said I would need to send the vacuum back and once that processed they would be able to send my coffee maker if they deem my claim to be valid. Does this sound weird to anyone else?

It’s not a casual diet hack — it requires serious oversight, planning and risk management. If you’re thinking of doing it, you *must* talk to a medical professional first.

**🔍 Key rules & careful prep**

* The “water only” rule: No calories at all, only water (2-3 litres/day typical). No tea, coffee, juice, broth if doing a strict water fast.
* Preparation phase: Medical consultation is essential. Before you begin: reduce processed foods, lower carbs, hydrate well, clear your schedule so you’re not under high stress. 
* Refeeding matters hugely: After 21-day fast you’ll need a gradual reintroduction phase (for example 10+ days) starting with diluted juices or broths, then soft fruits/veggies, then healthy fats + protein, then full meals. 
* Light movement only: Intense exercise is not advised during. Body is in high stress already.

❔❔ What would you say is the biggest deterrent to trying a 21-day fast — muscle loss, electrolyte risk, mental stress, or something else?

1ok6rjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BGodInspired/comments/1ok6rjx/reflections_of_grace_a_journey_within/,Reflections of Grace: A Journey Within,"### Health and Wellness Devotional: Reflections of Grace – A Journey Within

**Scripture Focus:** 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 (NIV)

*“Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.”*

- - - - - -

### Day 1: Embracing Your Temple

As we embark on this journey of health and wellness, let us first remind ourselves that our bodies are more than mere vessels; they are temples of the Holy Spirit. This understanding nudges us to view our health as a sacred responsibility. It encourages us to treat our bodies with kindness and respect, just as we would treat a cherished guest.

**Reflection:**

Spend a few moments looking at yourself in the mirror. Instead of focusing on flaws, acknowledge the beauty in your uniqueness. The grace that fills your being is a reflection of God’s love.

**Action Step:**

Commit to nourishing your body today with healthy foods. Choose something vibrant and fresh – perhaps a colorful salad or a piece of wholesome fruit – and as you eat, remember that each bite is an act of worship.

- - - - - -

### Day 2: The Power of Movement

Movement is a gift that enhances both physical and mental well-being. Engaging in physical activity is not merely about burning calories; it’s a means to celebrate our ability to move, to breathe, and to live fully.

**Reflection:**

Where do you find joy in movement? Whether it’s dancing, walking in nature, or practicing yoga, view movement as a joyous expression rather than a chore.

**Action Step:**

Dedicate 20 minutes today to a movement that brings you joy. As you move, allow thoughts of gratitude to flow within you, thanking God for the ability to be active.

- - - - - -

### Day 3: The Gift of Rest

In our fast-paced world, rest can often feel like a luxury rather than a necessity. Yet, rest is fundamental to our overall health. The Sabbath is a reminder of the importance of resting in God’s grace – it is a time to recharge our bodies and refresh our spirits.

**Reflection:**

Consider the last time you took a break. How did it refresh you? What activities bring you peace and rejuvenation?

**Action Step:**

Plan a rest period today, be it a nap, a quiet moment with a book, or time spent in prayer. Use this time to center yourself and invite God’s peace into your heart.

- - - - - -

### Day 4: Cultivating a Healthy Mindset

Our thoughts influence our actions, and a positive mindset can dramatically affect our health choices. As we reflect on God’s grace, we are reminded to transform negative thinking into uplifting affirmations.

**Reflection:**

What negative self-talk do you often entertain? Challenge these thoughts and replace them with truth from Scripture – for you are fearfully and wonderfully made.

**Action Step:**

Write down three affirmations that celebrate who you are and how God sees you. Read them aloud each morning to start your day with positivity.

- - - - - -

### Day 5: Community and Connection

We were designed for connection. Engaging with others not only enhances our mental health but also supports our spiritual growth. Community allows us to share burdens and joys, amplifying our experience of God’s grace.

**Reflection:**

Reach out to a friend, family member, or member of your community today. What joy can you bring into someone else’s life?

**Action Step:**

Invite someone for a walk or a coffee, and share a moment of fellowship. Discuss your health and wellness journeys and encourage one another to keep going.

- - - - - -

### Closing Thoughts

As you continue on this journey of health and wellness, remember that each step you take is an opportunity to reflect God’s grace. Keep your eyes focused within, seeking wisdom and strength through prayer, connection, and nurturing your body. You are not alone in this journey; God walks with you, continually reminding you of your worth and calling.

**Prayer:**

1ok6qs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TMJ/comments/1ok6qs0/tmjtmd_nightmare/,TMJ/TMD Nightmare,"Writing this post because Reddit has actually helped me a lot through this hellish journey that I have been on. Everything for me started when I would wake up with tension headaches in the morning from clenching my teeth during my sleep. The tension headaches were a regular occurrence and something that I just learned to live with. I would pop ibuprofen, Tylenol, or Excedrin and go on about my day. When I had my regular headaches coupled with occipital neuralgia (shock-like pain) at the base of my skull & the back of my head, I decided to seek help. I also would frequently wake up with what I called a ""crick"" in my neck or upper back. I experienced a sharp pain and tightness when turning my head or looking down. I could feel ""knots"" in the base of my skull, shoulders, and upper back. Trying to ease the knots away with massages, stretching, or a tennis ball was futile. I later learned these ""knots"" were migraines or a sign that a migraine was on the way.

I was referred to a neurologist and a pain management doctor after trying and failing several medications with my PCP (diclofenac, Fioricet, sumatriptan, tizanidine, methocarbomal, propranolol, etc. etc.). An MRI showed chronic migraine, and I was then prescribed Ubrelvy 100 mg tab and Ajovy 225 injection once a month. I also take cyclobenzaprine at night. At my worst, I was having 15 or more headache days per month. The medications seemed to help, but I am still experiencing 2 migraines a week (at the least). Migraines are usually accompanied by sensitivity to light, sound, & smell. More often than not I get nauseous and vomit from the pain. :') Along with migraines, I am in chronic pain from my neck. I wake up like I slept 0 hours, and I'm constantly running on empty. I am a 70-year-old in a 35-year-old body… and I am sick of it!!!

While seeing my PCP and the neurologist, I also saw an orthodontist who said she could help me with TMJ/TMD and facial pain. She said that fixing my bite would help with daytime and nighttime clenching. She also administered Botox, which really helped with the pain. Throughout this whole process, I've had Botox administered 4 times. I tried Angel Aligners for a few months, but they just made me grind my teeth even more during the day. They're also a lot of work for lazy girls like me who don't want to take them out every time I eat or drink. After failing the aligners, we decided on metal braces. It has been two months since I've had them on. *Smile!*

Thanks to Reddit. I started seeing an osteopath who referred me to her actual dentist that had helped her with her own TMJ issues. She advised that I get a second opinion on the braces, since I had seen an increase in migraines and facial pain, especially after getting them tightened. Yesterday after meeting with her, I was very discouraged. After reviewing x-rays, she let me know that my lower jaw never grew to its potential. My braces will have to come off, and I will start orthopedic orthodontic treatment with her. At her discretion, I'll either do a palate expander to move the lower jawbone to the correct position OR dental splints that will be worn both night and day. Hopefully surgery won't be needed, but I did not think to ask about that. She also will have me do a sleep study, as she suspects that my jaw causes my airway to be restricted, thus causing sleep apnea. She also recommended that I wear Breathe Right strips pretty much all the time.

The lovely osteopathic doctor works in conjunction with her spouse, who is a chiropractor. It has been about a month of treatment: adjustments, stretches on a vibrating plate, weights hanging from the back of my head, etc. He advised that I'll probably feel worse before I feel better. Following his regimen, he is confident that he can get my straight neck curved how it is supposed to be as well as my spine. He thinks that he can cut the number of headaches that I have in half. This whole process will take 7 months. With my OD's guidance, I have been following an elimination diet for the past three weeks. I've cut out gluten, dairy, eggs, soy, SUGAR!!!, coffee, sodas, and my will to live (jk). Luckily my wonderful spouse has been a godsend during these JoURNeYs, helping me with meal prep and keeping the kitchen stocked with healthy food.

I guess I'm writing this sub for anyone who is going through the same hell that I have been going through for the past 3+ years. At the first sign of pain in your temples or face, please go see a TMJ specialist! A regular dentist will probably just advise you to get a mouthguard to wear at night, which does nothing to solve any actual problems. If you are in or have been in the same boat, did fixing your jaw actually help? Is continuing to see a chiropractor something that you would recommend? I am tired and at my wit's end with everything and don't know if I have it in me to continue treatment for 2 more years. I guess compared to a lifetime of pain, 2 years will be a blip. Any advice for a girl going through it? Also, if you took the time to read all of my ramblings, bless your heart, and thank you from the bottom of mine!!

1ok6nwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1ok6nwr/toxic_mil_with_new_baby_help/,Toxic MIL with new baby - help,"Buckle up for another story of entitled new grandparents.. 😵‍💫 seeking tips from those who've been there. Thanks! 

Before my son was born almost 4 months ago, I had a pretty good relationship with the in-laws. While they weren't my favorite people, we got along ok. Occasionally, I would even meet up with my MIL for wine or coffee without husband. However.. the in-laws quickly went off the deep-end day ONE my son came into this world. From initial attempts to bypass hospital wishes to ignoring my discomfort with baby hogging, from subtle jabs & critiques instead of gentle support to the disinterest in helpful grandparent tips, many things have been poorly handled since the first (possibly only) grandkid was born. (Husband has older 43 yr old brother who lives at home). Putting the pieces together, I've realized I never clashed with my assertive MIL before as I'd always go along with what she wanted, when she wanted it, etc. So there was nothing for her to be mad about with me. We'd see them about once a month to meet up for dinner, etc. Seeing them roughly every 7-10 days the first couple months after birth was waaay too much.😵‍💫 Before my son, I didn't have anything to protect or be in charge of. She sees herself as the matriarch & having hard time coming to terms she's not the matriarch of MY primary family. These people tainted my early postpartum phase. Entitlement started early, texting my husband declaring they'd arrive soon at the hospital before our blessing (he held them off, but the stress it caused still pisses me off to no end. I was recovering from c-section, bleeding, in pain, etc). Their wants come before my needs. Once home, my MIL demanded daily new baby pictures every 12-24 hrs... She finally took the hint I couldn't keep up after a second text saying we were quite busy adjusting & will send pics as able.🙄 She's the type who assertively rips newborn baby away to ""help"" & have to ask twice for him back. As I become more confident as a new mom, that's not happening anymore moving forward. They also would offer to take the baby many times for us to get a ""break."" Why would I want to seperate myself from my tiny newborn?! 

To top it off, MIL thinks my baby is her do-over 100%. While she hyper focuses on a nursery for him at her place & talks of taking him places (story hour at her local library, etc), my son has 0 books or toys in his actual bedroom from her. That's bizarre, right?? I feel that's lame. My mom has bought him a few crinkly books (told both her & MIL my son loves them) & stuffed animal. When I recently invited MIL out to coffee & calmly told her they wouldn't be co-parenting, she shut down with short, muted responses (has a loud, boisterous personality). I asked for her to scale back the overzealousness, that I felt overwhelmed as a new mom. She deflected with the non-apology, ""sorry you feel that way."" When I said we love them & appreciate them, she ignored & said ""k."" I tried to be positive & respectful -- she threw a jevenile fit, IMO.. Apparently, my in-laws had big plans of basically raising my son, having him 5+ days a wk while we work, I guess.. NO THANKS. The entitlement is through the roof. When I make attempts to bond/ share helpful resources on grandparenting thru text or Facebook, I'm ignored. Last time she ignored & sent a text about the weather instead. There is 0 interest in what I have to say & I feel invisible.. Only my husband gets glowing thank yous or acknowledgment when we see them or through texts. They're definitely going the route of try to bypass / cut me out & gain grandson access thru husband by buttering him up. Low contact it is. I keep our calendar busy. Information diet, rarely sending baby pictures now & I don't bother texting first anymore. They made their own bed. Right now, we see them roughly every 2-ish weeks, which is more than enough. I'm surely the bad guy, keeping their grandson away from them.. 

I can see it from miles away.. they'd do whatever they want while watching baby, nap routines, any rules.. why would they suddenly care to respect my wishes when they haven't thus far? I'm not crazy here, right?! I could see us having clashes over routines, safety, etc. Babies & toddlers generally thrive on consistency. Right now, I am thinking maaaybe they'll earn a date night spot a couple times a month. Otherwise, all-day childcare is not happening on my watch. How do I get my husband to see how bad it is?? He largely defends them & says they're just excited. Unfortunately, he wasn't present for most passive-agressive comments & some baby hogging. I'm currently looking for a part-time nanny (my folks will watch 1-2 days a week). My husband did tell his folks recently that as we still finalize childcare (return from maternity leave in December), in the new year they may be needed once a week. This poked major holes in their plans/agendas 100%. They made no response or acknowledgment, just listened.

1ok6mvr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ok6mvr,I visited a bunch of cat cafes in Japan,"Cafe Mocha runs an established chain of cat cafes all across Japan. I know there’s some skepticism about the practice as a whole, but my own experience and conversations with many of their compassionate employees led me to believe that they care deeply about the well-being of their feline pals and sustain their business as ethically as possible. 

Many positive signs included tidy, scentless facilities with lots of toys. Employees ran lint rollers and regularly groomed and trimmed each cat while reassuring them in a soothing voice. Shiny coats and clean nails for all. The relaxed temperament of the cats seemed to reflect their sense of ownership of the space—I’ve visited other franchises with lingering odors of pee accidents from thinning, skittish cats that fought over kibble. It was a slightly heartbreaking scene, but rest assured Cafe Mocha lay far on the opposite spectrum. Really made me realize that cats are the reflection of the home you provide. 

Other reassuring guardrails were the enforcement of no chasing after or picking up the cats, no flash photography, and the requirement of adult supervision for children (although things could get a tad rowdy when a parent brings a gang of four, five kids). Certain locations would open applications to seek forever homes for those ready to “graduate” from their cafe. The adopters’ anonymity remained protected, as some of the stars had amassed quite a following. 

Other non-cat related perks were unlimited drinks (soda, juice, coffee, tea, water, even soup), all-you-can-read manga, board games, free wifi, charging cables, and a Nintendo Switch at some spots. Gacha machines containing Churu capsules and specialty kitty treats like iced lollipops could be purchased as extras. The staff could kind of get by on basic English, but please don’t take their efforts for granted and appreciate that they are trying very hard to make the place just as welcoming for non-Japanese speaking visitors. 

Overall, I highly recommend Cafe Mocha as a joyful cat-filled respite for anyone roaming through Japan. I left each cat’s name and location in the comments. Enjoy the view, and feel free to ask any questions 👋😺",7,1761846709.0,cats,1,1.0,False

I have two 3-seater couches, a long narrow Sideboard with two double-doors and drawers in the middle. I also have a six seater dining room table

We were gifted a massive TV, so we cannot place it above the fireplace. BTW, that hole in the wall above the fireplace used to be a cabinet with doors. I have no idea where the doors are but the previous occupants installed that wooden plank to presumably mount their TV. I could get doors custom made

I’m just not sure how to place the couches not to block the walkway to the door. The dining room has to go under the chandelier. But the sideboard should be in close proximity. And I will probably install the TV above it

So should one couch face the fireplace? Or should I place both perpendicular to the fireplace? Oh and I have a small coffee table and side tables. A floor lamp

What do I do underneath that opening to the kitchen? The kitchen sink is on the other side so I don’t imagine I’ll be pulling up a counter chair and serving dinner from there

1ok6jth,https://www.reddit.com/r/BGodInspired/comments/1ok6jth/embracing_love_a_devotional_journey_in_loving/,Embracing Love: A Devotional Journey in Loving Others,"What Jesus teaches about Loving others

Introduction
------------

Imagine a world where love is the guiding principle in all our interactions. It sounds like a dream, but Jesus invites us to make it a reality. His teachings about loving others can transform our personal lives and the communities around us. When we choose love, we reflect God’s heart and bring light to the darkness.

In a society that often emphasizes self-interest, Jesus shows us a different way: a path where compassion, kindness, and genuine care become the norm. Let’s explore how Jesus’ timeless teachings on love can impact our lives today.

Bible Verse
-----------

John 13:34-35 (NIV): “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”

Meaning
-------

In this profound statement, Jesus commands us to love others with the same fervor and commitment that He has shown us. His love is sacrificial, selfless, and unconditional, setting a standard that challenges us to rise above ordinary love.

Loving as Jesus loves means seeing beyond the surface. It requires understanding, patience, and often forgiveness. It’s about putting the needs of others above our own and seeking their well-being.

This love is a witness to the world. When we follow Jesus’ example, we become beacons of His light. Our love becomes a testament to our faith and a reflection of God’s love for humanity. Through such love, people “will know that you are my disciples.”

Actions to Take
---------------

- **Practice Active Listening:** Take the time to truly hear others without interrupting, fostering deeper connections and understanding.
- **Show Kindness Daily:** Perform simple acts of kindness, such as paying for someone’s coffee or writing a heartfelt note.
- **Offer Forgiveness:** Let go of grudges and strive to forgive, just as Jesus forgives us.
- **Serve Others:** Volunteer your time and resources to help those in need, reflecting God’s love in action.
- **Pray for Others:** Dedicate time each day to pray for those around you, including those you find challenging to love.

Journal Prompts
---------------

- Reflect on a time when someone showed you unexpected love. How did it impact you?
- Write about a person you find difficult to love. What steps can you take to change your perspective?
- Consider how Jesus’ example of love can be implemented in your relationships. What changes might you need to make?
- List three people you want to show love to this week and plan specific actions for each.
- Explore any obstacles within yourself that prevent you from loving others as Jesus loves you.

Prayer
------

Lord Jesus, thank You for Your perfect example of love. Help me to love others as You have loved me. Show me how to see beyond faults and flaws, and embrace others with grace and compassion. May my actions reflect Your love and draw others closer to You. Amen.

Social Posts
------------

- “Love one another deeply, just as Jesus loves us. #LoveLikeJesus #FaithInAction”
- “By our love, the world will know our faith. Let’s be a light today! #BeTheLight #LoveOneAnother”
- “Small acts of love can change the world. Spread kindness today! #LoveInAction #KindnessMatters”
- “Imagine a world where love reigns supreme. It starts with us! #LiveLove #FaithfulLiving”
- “Forgive and love, for that’s the way of Jesus. #JesusWay #ForgiveAndLove”

Conclusion
----------

As we embark on this journey of loving one another as Jesus has loved us, we not only enrich our own lives but also impact the world around us. The ripple effect of our love has the power to transform hearts and communities. Let’s embrace this mission and watch how God works through our dedication to His command.

1ok6j0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ok6j0y/being_lonely_in_late_twenties/,Being lonely in late twenties,"Hi. As the title says, I feel extremely lonely in my late twenties (28F).

Because of years of emotional/relationship turmoils and also years of therapy I finally figured out that people I had in my life were mostly emotionally unavailable. I always played a role of managing other people's emotions and adapting to them and their ways. Most of the time I always felt either like a burden/or like a feast/where relationship was build solely on their terms through intensity(romantic) or avoidance/absence(friendships).

And that's my thing, my pattern, I know that.

Well, now that I know that and I feel like I actually maybe can deserve reciprocal, loving, present friendships my old connections started falling away (not many were there anyways but still).

Well but I still struggle. I feel pathetic that I am so lonely when I am already ""so old"", that even if I go and join for example (queer) game nights and such, I will look like this out of place weirdo among people in their early twenties.

I feel like such a failure in life in this ""community sense"".

And funny thing is that even if I am introverted, I would be deeply happy to give love and presence to people I would call my friends, and receive that back. I would like that before I would have something romantic with someone, because I don't want my future partner to be my only friend.


** my dream is to like grab a cup of coffee on a random sunday morning, late afternoon invite for a movie or just exist in the same room for a bit reading books, sharing a connection.",3,1761846472.0,FriendshipAdvice,2,1.0,False

**Warning: This contains cringe. Please forgive me in advance.**

I have been sober for 19 days now. I should be happy, but I am skeptically cautious. If that is even a real word/saying. This is not the first time I was sober for this long. The firs time was sober for consecutive amount of days, I was 26 days sober some time in August. On the 26th day, my heart started racing rapidly, panic ensues and I relapse. Is it normal to have that happen? Is there a way to avoid it? Looking back, maybe I was dehydrated. Who knows. I wanted to post an update on my 15th day, but I wanted to make sure I didn't post and relapses. Also, I was kind of ashamed that it took me this long, to be this sober again. I know it stupid to have that mentality, but I tried for so long, and having that victory being taken away by me, made me, almost gave up on this. At the same time, that also gave me hope that I have that ability to be sober. So after many, many, many failed attempts...I got to this point. 

This is what worked for me in this attempt:

   1. **Drinking a lot of water**. Never allowing that to happen again.

   2. **Getting rid of my enablers**. I have a spare phone(s) that I use for my...addiction. I have factory reset them and drained the battery. I will get rid of the batteries and toss the phones out. You know the saying; out of site, out of mind. Well I hope the idea applies here too. 

   3. **""Moving to another room""**. Where I live, I have a spare room. I sleep in that room, I stay in that room and avoid my bedroom. The reason is that I do **that** in my bedroom. This avoidance mentality comes from the idea of trying to fall back asleep. If you can't sleep, don't stay in your room, go to another and stay awake there. Walk around, do whatever, then go back to your room and you'll feel tired again. With that in mind, I avoid my room, so I don't feel comfortable to relapse and slowly start to integrate back into being in my room. To get me use to the idea that my bedroom is more than doing my addiction. 

   4. **Watching my health**. I use an app to track my calories and been working out. From 238lbs (107.955 kilos) to 224lbs (101.605 kilos). Not much, but significant to me. Using that extra energy into the gym and not holding it in really helps. 

   5. **Hanging out with friends and family more**. Being distracted helps me not think of it. Even though certain scenes tend to randomly pop up in my mind, I tend to brush it away when I am doing other activities. Also, I've been allowing myself to enjoy life a little bit. Because....why not? If I can't hangout with people, I'll hangout out with myself and go on an adventure. Hence me finding out different restaurants and coffee places that I never knew existed. 

   6. **Improving myself**. Other than watching my health, I have been reading more, teaching myself new things. All of this is comprise in a list that I want to accomplished. 

   7. **Cleaning my room**. I don't know. When I was a few days in my sobriety, I slowly started cleaning my room. wiping, throwing, disinfecting. My room is relatively clean, but subconsciously, it makes me think I am wiping away the addiction. The more I clean, the more the addiction fades away.  After all...fighting this addiction is a mental game as well. 

   8. **Being okay to being emotionally alone**. Everyone becomes an addict for one reason or another. For me, I guess it was to fill emotional emptiness. It was a long road, but I am now comfortable with me being emotionally alone. That it may not be important to always have someone to fill that emptiness. That I am enough and any more is like a sweet dessert after a good meal. 

This is what helped me so far. I have no idea if this will help you, but I do hope and pray that this could encourage you to not give up, like how many of your posts continuously gave me that same courage. I have never been happier, and I feel a lot better. So thank you, all of you!",2,1761846417.0,PornAddiction,0,1.0,False

I get asked by people all the time how I don’t smell, my house doesn’t smell (yes, it still smells like pets, but not disgusting pee or poo smell), and how I don’t have hair all over me when I go out. Worth noting I also have ADHD.

I deep clean every single Monday. I choose mondays because trash day is Tuesday’s so all the stuff goes right to the road rather than sitting around stinking. I go room by room and start with surfaces first. Obviously everyone has a different house layout/setup, but I do bathroom, bedrooms (I have 2), living room, kitchen, litter box room/mud room. That means wiping down every single surface, top & bottom shelf of coffee tables, the whole entire toilet, the tub, top of dressers, etc. I do things like windows, light switches, cabinets, walls, etc on an as needed basis. When they start to look dirty, I clean them. After all of this I mop the entire house with a bissell cross wave, one of the best and most handy purchases as an adult. I pull my couches out every week and mop under them. I do under my bed & stuff usually 4 times a year (only because it’s harder to move things around in my bedrooms). 

The litter room I pay more attention to, I do clean the boxes every single day, but they are dumped on Monday & refilled. I pull them all out, mop under them, mop under every single dog kennel, and wash all the water and food bowls as well. This takes me about 1.5-2 hours start to finish for all the rooms and cleaning. 

I burn candles if I have guests over as well to help with any smells. 

Every single time I see a mess, whether it’s puke, pee, etc, I immediately clean it, toss it in an outside bin, and wash the floor (it’s worth noting I have all hard wood flooring so it’s easier to clean fast than carpet). 

I wash the dishes every single day. Remember that it’s okay if things do need to soak overnight. And it’s also okay if you cannot get to the cleaning right away if you’re tired or had a busy day but do it the next day. 

I spot clean daily such as kitchen counter tops, bathroom counter tops, and I vacuum at least every other day (but try to do it daily). I wash the animals bedding every week. I wash my bedding every week. I have 1 laundry hamper and when that is full, I do laundry. It’s not feesible for me to do daily laundry as I am one person but I usually do it about every 3-4 days depending if I leave the house & change out of pajamas. 

I have couch covers (just regular throw blankets and those are also washed weekly, or more often depending. Helps so I don’t have to worry about vacuuming cat hair off the couches. 

Edit: I keep my clothes clean by as soon as I’m ready to fold (and I do my laundry immediately as it’s done), I fold them or hang them and put away. The basket does not sit out. If you want to minimize the hair get a basket with a lid. The dryer removes most of the hair that gets on it and anything else a lint roller will easily pick up. My cats aren’t allowed to sit in dresser drawers or in my closet. I make my bed every morning so pet hair doesn’t get under my covers where I actually sleep. My dogs enjoy sleeping under blankets but they sleep on top of the top cover & I put blankets over top of them. But I also don’t care if my pajamas are hairy like I do my regular clothes. 

That’s pretty much all I can think of. 

I like having a clean home. It makes me happy. And the biggest thing to remember is even if you didn’t clean everything you wanted in one day…that’s okay, there’s always tomorrow. Never beat yourself up as long as you did something. Homes aren’t meant to look cookie cutter perfect and it’s okay if your home looks lived in.

I assumed that's just life after thirty. My face appeared tight and lifeless, and my makeup began to cling to strange, dry spots.

No, however. My skin simply felt worn out. Glycolic, lactic, retinol, niacinamide, vitamin C, exfoliating toners, and various holy grail serums that TikTok claimed I needed were all things I was essentially attacking for years. It looked like Sephora had exploded in my bathroom. How about my skin? cranky. Flaky, tight, red, and somehow still boring. I remember thinking, What am I doing wrong? one evening after applying moisturizer and my face literally stung. I made the decision to take everything away. My routine is now absurdly easy:

CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser

Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion (the hydrating one)

La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume morning + night

Supergoop Unseen SPF during the day


That’s it. No exfoliating, no vitamin C, no brightening serums. Just healing mode with some really basic stuff.

I even started tracking stuff like coffee, sleep, and stress in my Notes with an app and it’s wild how clearly I can see patterns now. Like, 3 nights of crappy sleep = dullness, two glasses of wine = tiny breakouts near my mouth. 😭

After two weeks, my face stopped feeling tight. Around week 5, I swear I caught myself in the mirror and went, yes finally my skin looks kinda good, Smooth, calm, alive again. It feels like my skin finally forgave me for years of overdoing it.

Lesson learned: sometimes your skin doesn’t need another “active,” it just needs you to chill. Especially once you hit your 30s and your barrier isn’t bouncing back overnight anymore.

Especially through my maternity leave, the vast majority of which I received no paycheck, and yet I still continued to spend....I've got ADHD and such poor impulse control when it comes to spending!! I'm gonna list my tallies cause I'm appalled and want to take accountability for myself for my 2025 spending so far:

Haircuts/color: $235.25

Initial investment into birdwatching and birdfeeding supplies plus subsequent feed: $921.23

Crochet patterns and supplies: $228.85

Books: 98.77

PS5 games: $273.12

Clothes:  $826.43

Misc: $485.52

Grand totaling $3069.17

I'm honestly shocked. This is money I could've used to pay bills during my leave instead of my emergency savings dwindling to almost nothing. The bird feeding investments and clothes are what shocked me the most, though a good chunk of the clothes were maternity items, which I could never seem to find at thrift stores 🙄

My goals starting now and for 2026 are:

-to only buy crochet and PS5 items/games one at a time and only when my current projects are finished

-only buy bird feed once a month

-absolutely no clothes buying, I've got a variety of clothing sizes for a wide range of weights I have been, so no need to buy anything smaller or bigger at this time 

-reduce coffee buying to twice per month (I didn't even tally coffee and DoorDash spending but I know they were atrocious)

-read 5 books before I'm allowed to buy one, I've got way too many unread books 

Anyways if you made it this far thanks for reading. I'm ashamed at how grossly I have spent on myself and I'm looking forward to simplifying going forward.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Barndominiums have become a trendy choice for modern living, offering the perfect blend of functionality and style. These unique structures, often taking the form of a barn-like exterior combined with a cozy interior, are popular among homeowners looking for spacious, versatile floor plans. Whether you're considering building your own or simply exploring ideas, understanding some of the best barndominium floor plans will help you envision your dream home.

### Why Choose a Barndominium?

Barndominiums are not only visually appealing but also practical. They allow for large open spaces, making them ideal for families, hobbyists, or those seeking a workshop or studio space. Here are a few reasons to consider this innovative living option:

- **Durability:** Built with sturdy metal frames, barndominiums can withstand harsh weather conditions.
- **Low Maintenance:** The materials used in barndominium construction require less upkeep than traditional wood-frame homes.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Many barndominiums are designed with energy-efficient features, which can reduce utility bills.
- **Customization:** You can easily personalize the layout and design according to your needs.

### Popular Barndominium Floor Plans

Finding the right floor plan is essential for creating a functional living space. Here are some of the best barndominium floor plans that combine modern design with everyday living needs:

#### 1. Open Concept Living

This layout typically includes a spacious living room, dining area, and kitchen in one open area. The absence of walls allows for maximum interaction and natural light. This design is particularly appealing for families who enjoy being together and entertaining guests.

#### 2. Split Bedroom Plan

For those who value privacy, a split bedroom layout is ideal. This plan separates the master suite from the additional bedrooms, providing peace and tranquility. Couples can enjoy their own space while allowing kids or guests to have their separate quarters.

#### 3. Lofted Design

If you have high ceilings, consider incorporating a loft into your barndominium. A lofted area can serve as an office, an extra bedroom, or a cozy reading nook. This design maximizes the use of vertical space, making the home feel larger.

#### 4. Multi-Purpose Spaces

Barndominiums excel at versatility. Many floor plans include spaces that can serve multiple functions. For instance, a room could function as a guest bedroom, home gym, or craft area. The ability to adapt spaces for different uses is perfect for modern living.

#### 5. Outdoor Living Areas

Integrating outdoor spaces is a key feature of many barndominium designs. Patios, decks, and porches help bring the outdoors inside, promoting a lifestyle that embraces nature. These areas can be ideal for barbecues, lounging, or simply enjoying a morning cup of coffee.

### Design Elements to Consider

When choosing the best floor plan for your barndominium, think about key design elements that will enhance your living experience. Here are considerations that can make your barndominium stand out:

- **Kitchens:** An open kitchen with an island can become the heart of the home, perfect for cooking and socializing.
- **Storage:** Ensure ample storage options with built-in cabinets, walk-in closets, or even a pantry to keep things organized.
- **Natural Light:** Large windows not only let in light but also connect you with the surrounding landscape.
- **Eco-Friendly Features:** Consider incorporating solar panels, energy-efficient appliances, and sustainable materials to reduce your home’s environmental footprint.


Exploring the best barndominium floor plans opens up a world of possibilities for modern living. With their unique combination of strength, functionality, and style, barndominiums are destined to become a favorite choice for homebuyers. Whether you favor a cozy retreat, a spacious family residence, or a multi-purpose layout, these designs can meet various lifestyles and needs. Dive into the world of barndominiums, and you might just find the perfect plan that suits your vision of home.

Key Elements to Consider When Designing Your Dream Barndominium
---------------------------------------------------------------

Designing your dream barndominium can be an exciting journey, but there are key elements you should consider to ensure that your vision becomes a reality. Whether you’re drawn to rustic aesthetics or modern designs, getting the right floor plan is crucial.

### Understanding Your Needs

Before diving into designs, it’s vital to assess your personal needs. Ask yourself:

- How many bedrooms do you need?
- Do you require a home office or workshop?
- What type of living space setup works best for your lifestyle?
- Do you want an open floor plan or separate living areas?

Understanding your requirements will help narrow down your choices and make the design process smoother.

### Choosing the Right Layout

The layout of your barndominium significantly impacts functionality and flow. Some popular layout options include:

- **Open Concept:** Ideal for social gatherings, this layout combines the kitchen, dining, and living spaces into one area. It enhances the feeling of freedom and spaciousness.
- **Split Design:** This design separates the master bedroom from the other bedroom areas, offering privacy and quiet. It works well for families with children or guests.
- **Multi-Level Designs:** If you have a smaller footprint but want more space, consider a multi-story barndominium. Stairs can lead to extra bedrooms or a loft area.

Choosing a layout that fits your family’s daily activities will make a positive difference in your living experience.

### Maximizing Natural Light

Integrating natural light into your design can transform any space into a warm and inviting environment. Consider these tips:

- Large Windows: Use oversized windows or sliding glass doors to create a seamless connection between indoor and outdoor spaces.
- Skylights: Installing skylights can brighten up dark areas and provide a unique architectural feature.
- Strategic Placement: Position windows to maximize sun exposure, ensuring that common areas benefit from the most light during the day.

Natural light not only enhances aesthetics but also contributes to better mood and well-being.

### Choosing Quality Materials

The materials you select for your barndominium play a significant role in durability and maintenance. High-quality materials can also improve energy efficiency. Consider the following:

- **Siding Options:** Metal siding can withstand harsh weather conditions while offering a modern look. Wood siding provides a classic aesthetic but may require more maintenance.
- **Insulation:** Choose an insulation method that fits your climate needs, whether spray foam, fiberglass, or cellulose, to enhance comfort.
- **Flooring:** Enhance functionality by opting for durable and easy-to-clean flooring materials like vinyl or tile, especially in high-traffic areas.

Investing in quality materials upfront can save you money in repairs and replacements down the line.

### Outdoor Spaces

Outdoor living is a significant benefit of barndominium life. You can capitalize on this by incorporating:

- **Porches and Decks:** These areas can serve as outdoor gathering spaces for family and friends, blurring the lines between home and nature.
- **Landscaping Features:** Thoughtful landscaping can enhance curb appeal and provide areas for gardening or recreation.
- **Outdoor Kitchens:** For those who enjoy entertaining, adding an outdoor kitchen can expand your living space significantly.

Creating outdoor options will help you enjoy the natural surroundings while adding functional living space.

### Planning for Storage

Storage is often overlooked in planning but is essential in maintaining a clutter-free environment. Here are helpful storage solutions:

- **Built-In Cabinets:** Utilize built-in shelving and cabinets in common areas to keep items organized without taking up extra space.
- **Under-Stair Storage:** If you choose a multi-level design, consider storage options beneath stairs.
- **Closet Space:** Ensure bedrooms have adequate closet space to avoid clutter in living areas.

Effective storage solutions can enhance the overall functionality of your home.

By considering these elements when designing your barndominium, you can create a living space that aligns perfectly with your lifestyle and preferences. Embrace your vision to design a functional, beautiful retreat where you and your loved ones can truly thrive.

### Conclusion

Choosing the perfect floor plan for your barndominium is a significant step toward creating a space that embodies both functionality and beauty. As you've explored the best barndominium floor plans for modern living, it’s clear that flexibility and open spaces are essential components. These designs not only accommodate today's lifestyle but also offer the chance to harness natural light and create a welcoming environment.

When designing your dream barndominium, it's vital to consider key elements such as layout, room sizes, and overall flow. Think about how you will use each space, ensuring it meets your family's needs and lifestyle preferences. Whether you prefer a rustic charm or a sleek, contemporary look, incorporating personal touches will make your barndominium truly unique.

Another important aspect is to evaluate your property and its surroundings. The landscape can greatly influence your design choices, and planning for outdoor living spaces can enhance your enjoyment. Additionally, energy efficiency and sustainability should be top considerations; these elements not only lower your utility bills but also contribute to a healthier planet.

As you embark on this exciting journey, remember that the best barndominium designs are those that resonate with you personally. Take your time exploring different options and gathering inspiration. This project is more than just constructing a building; it’s about creating a home where memories will be made and cherished for years to come. With thoughtful planning and a clear vision, your dream barndominium will become a reality that reflects your lifestyle and values.",1,1761846170.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

1ok69ia,https://i.redd.it/ezgybmr3cayf1.png,OpenAI's new Atlas browser blocks only 5.8% of phishing attacks while Chrome blocks 47%. I tested it for 3 days and the security issues are actually scary,"OpenAI dropped their Atlas browser last week and everyone's hyped about the AI agent that can browse websites for you. MacOS only for now.

I spent 3 days testing it. The agent mode is cool but the security vulnerabilities are genuinely terrifying.

**The number that should freak you out:**

Researchers tested Atlas with 103 real-world phishing attacks. It blocked 5.8%. Chrome and Edge blocked 47-53%.

That's not a typo. The AI browser designed to click around websites for you can't tell when a website is trying to steal your passwords.

**What happened when security researchers tested it:**

Researchers at SquareX were able to trick Atlas into visiting a malicious site disguised as the Binance crypto exchange login page.

Malicious code on one website could potentially trick the AI agent into switching to your open banking tab and submitting a transfer form.

OpenAI's own CISO admitted ""prompt injection remains a frontier, unsolved security problem.""

So OpenAI knows this is broken and released it anyway.

**The privacy nightmare:**

ChatGPT Atlas has ""browser history"" meaning ChatGPT can log the websites you visit and what you do on them and use that information to make answers more personalized.

EFF staff technologist testing found that Atlas memorized queries about ""sexual and reproductive health services via Planned Parenthood Direct"" including a real doctor's name. Such searches have been used to prosecute people in restricted states.

Your medical searches. Banking sites. Private messages. Everything you do in Atlas gets fed to OpenAI's servers unless you manually use incognito mode for every session.

MIT Technology Review concluded ""the real customer, the true end user of Atlas, is not the person browsing websites, it is the company collecting data about what and how that person is browsing.""

**What actually works (because I did test it):**

The agent mode can fill out job applications by pulling info from your resume. Worked after a couple tries.

Shopping comparison is decent. It opened multiple tabs and compared coffee machines for me.

The sidebar ChatGPT is useful. Highlight any text anywhere and ask questions without copy-pasting.

**What completely failed:**

Restaurant reservations via Resy. Atlas just clicked around aimlessly without checking availability.

Speed is terrible. Reddit users noted Atlas takes about 8x longer than Perplexity's Comet browser for similar tasks.

MIT Technology Review tested the shopping agent and it kept trying to add items they'd already purchased and no longer needed. The AI isn't smart enough to understand context.

**My actual experience:**

I asked it to fill out a job application. It worked. I asked it to book a restaurant. It failed completely. I asked it to compare products. It worked but took forever.

Everything felt like watching someone learn to use a computer for the first time. Painfully slow, makes obvious mistakes, requires constant supervision.

**Here's what concerns me:**

OpenAI is pushing this as a productivity tool while knowing the security is fundamentally broken. TechCrunch's testing found that while agents work well for simple tasks, they struggle to reliably automate the more cumbersome problems users might want to offload.

So it can't do the hard stuff that would actually save time. But it CAN be tricked into draining your bank account or logging your medical searches.

**The question nobody's asking:**

Why did OpenAI release this knowing the security was broken?

They admitted prompt injection is unsolved. They know phishing detection is terrible. They know malicious sites can trick the agent.

But they released it anyway because they needed to compete with Perplexity's Comet browser? Because AI browser agents are trendy right now?

**My take:**

Don't use Atlas for anything sensitive. Banking, healthcare, legal stuff, private communications - keep that in Chrome or Firefox.

If you want to test the agent mode for random tasks like comparing products or filling out forms, fine. But understand you're giving OpenAI access to everything you browse and the security is genuinely bad.

I'm sticking with Chrome. Atlas is interesting as a tech demo but it's not worth the risk.

**Questions:**

Am I overreacting about the security stuff or are these legitimate concerns?

Has anyone else tested this and found the agent mode actually reliable?",1,1761845883.0,CreatorsAI,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Was super intense cherry and chocolate, and insanely sweet too - Gonna let it rest a bit and see what else I can get out of it, kinda tasted like raspberry and strawberry a bit too, 

Was looking at the Sidra too just to check it out. Anyone else had the Sidra? I feel like they can be hit or miss, and the price is a bit steep, but this sl28 was worth so I might just jump on the Sidra?? ",4,1761845675.0,pourover,1,0.75,False

1ok661e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maxwell_Isekaied/comments/1ok661e/016_conners_conversations_and_coffee/,"016: Conners, Conversations and Coffee","Max & May had been welcomed into the Conners' family home by Mrs. Maggie Conners when Mr. Arnold Conners had introduced Max and May to her. The three story whitewashed farm house was surrounded by a copes of trees. With a big red barn, doors wide open just off to the side of the home. A large silo can be seen peaking over the top of the barn. The screen door gave a squeek as Maggie opened it and led them inside. 


Maggie led them to the kitchen and sat them both down at the table, ""You two look thin let me get you something to eat."" She started bustleing around the kitchen grabbing leftovers and making coffee. Max smiled feeling the warmth and happiness of the home. His eyes widened in shock though when the wiki-power activated and words flew into his vision. 


Name: Maggie Conners 
Age: 62 
First Appearance: Titan 01
Powers: N/A
Weaknesses: Normal Human 


Notable Events: Found baby Clyde Conners in his crashed pod from Titania: Titan 01. Helped Brad, The Owl, Vickers through the loss of his son: TOL 332. Helped Max & May reach Titan for training: M&M 17. 


Max read and reread the notable events section. He was in it and so was May. The Previous notable event that had contained May was gone, replaced by this new one. Max relized that his actions were causing the comics to change and now he seemed to have a comic about him. That was being referenced in the wiki ability he had. He noticed a silence in the room. ""I am sorry, I must be tired. What did you say Mrs. Conners?"" He asked.


""Call me Maggie youngster."" Mrs. Conners smiled as she spoke. ""I asked if you had eaten yet and if you would like some coffee?"" Max looked at May whom had a steaming cup in her hands, watching the steam twirl in the cool evening air. ""Yes mam. That would be wonderful, and we havent eaten yet. So food would be wonderful."" Maggie gave a winning smile and proceeded to make him and May each a plate of leftover steak and potatoes. Max and May dug in greedily. Making pleasent noises as they ate. 


Arnold and Maggie both sat down at the table across from Max & May, and waited for them to finish eating. Once they had cleaned there plates Mr. Conners sipped from his coffee and asked ""So tell us how you two found each other and how did you get here?"" Max & May started talking at the same time, then they stopped and looked at each other before giving out a little laugh. ""You go."" Max told her and sat back as May told the Conners everything that had happened to her and him over the past few days. Max would occasionally interrupt to mention a part of the story she wasn't there for.


The Conners were hanging on every word and listened closely to May & Max's journey. ""So then the new car got a flat and Max and I started walking. That's when we found you."" May finishes her story, her and Max's hands finding each other while she spoke. He gave her a soft squeeze and she gave him one back with a smile on her face. ""And that's when you came running out of the corn and flew up infront of my compactor. Scaring the life out of me for sure."" Arnold finished her story with his part. ""Well let me give Clyde a call. He will want to hear this story also."" Maggie stood from the table and walked to her phone in the living room and gave her son Clyde a call. 


Max yawned wide and loud. Causing May to yawn aswell. Arnold looked at them both then he gestured towards the stairs ""Theres a guestroom upstairs. Third door on the left and the bathroom is the second door on the right from the stairs. How about you two go and take a rest, looks like you need it. No funny business though."" He finishes with a broad teasing smile and a wag of his finger. 


May & Max both blush to Arnold's delight. Then they both rise from the table. Still holding hands Max nods at Arnold ""Thanks mate. I.."" a big yawn breaks through his sentence ""really need to sleep."" Arnold nods knowing how much a long drive can take from a person. May pulls Max towards the stairs by the hand ""Come on Max I need my hair washed."" she says as she smiles, looking forward to there little shower time together. Arnold laughs ""Got him trained already dontcha."" Max can hear the old man laughing as they climb the stairs excited to wash the road dust from themselves.


As Max starts the shower he hears Maggie downstairs yelling across the home to her husband. She asks him about the car and where it is before he replies, also yelling across the house. May feels the water with her hand before she strips off her clothing and steps into the shower. Already passing Max the shampoo she found by the time Max steps into the shower behind her. He smiles and starts lathering up her hair. ""They seem nice."" she says while leaning into his hands. 


""They are nice. Some of the best people on this planet for sure."" Max replies as he massages May's scalp through her hair. She breathes out in satisfaction as he works. ""Do you think he will like me?"" she asks trepidation in her voice. ""He will I promise you that May. Family is the most important thing to him and he will cherish meeting you as I have."" May spins infront of him and stares him in the eyes. ""Are you sure?"" Max's heart stops as he looks into those big golden eyes with her gold-blonde hair plastered to her head. ""I am sure."" Max tells her. ""Good."" she then turns around ""Now get the conditioner and make my hair shine."" ""Yes mam."" He says with a smile and laugh as he runs the conditioner through her freshly washed hair. 


They talk more, quietly in the shower together. Sharing inner fears and feelings and enjoying each other's company. May has grown fond of her and Max's shower talks. Theres something about the warm water and noise that just relaxes her and allows her to have an easier time talking about difficult subjects. She remembers her parents and how they would have loved the Conners, and can't stop from crying missing them both. Max holds her until her sobs stop and the shower grows cold. 


Maggie and Arnold talk below at the kitchen table. ""They have been in that shower awhile."" Maggie says. ""Well if you want to go up there and knock on the door. Go right ahead, but I ain't doin it."" Arnold playfully says as he nudges his wife. She gives a giggle remembering young love and her first days with Arnold. ""Maybe I will just give them a little more time then."" the elderly couple laugh together. ""You should have seen them blush when I told them no funny business."" Arnold tells his wife laughter in his voice. ""Now arnold we were young once too."" his wife chastized him. ""Ya but whats the fun being an old man if I cant make young people squirm a bit every now and then."" The old man said with a broad smile, remembering his younger days with Maggie. 


Maggie kisses him on the cheek ""Now now. Youve had your fun. Leave those two poor youngsters alone."" ""Ok honey."" Arnold replied. Knowing that the conversation about young love is over. 


""So when is Clyde arriving?"" Maggie looks at the clock at Arnold's words. ""Well he usually makes the flight in an hour but if he is bringing Evee then maybe two or more."" Arnold then stands from the table. ""Well in that case I am going to go get Gurdy from the feild and put her away for the night."" He cracks his back and grabs his keys. ""Do you want to join me? I will need someone to drive the truck back while I get Gurdy."" Magggie puts her half-empty cup on the table and follows her husband from the home. A farmer's job never stops. 


As they close the doors on the truck and drive into the fields Max & May finish there shower. Both emotionally drained from crying together and remembering ther past lives that are gone forever. He helps May dry her hair with a hairdryer he found in a bathroom drawer. Then they both stumble into the guestroom and fall into bed. So tired they don't even shut the door and fall asleep as soon as they lay fully on the bed. May snuggling against Max and his arm naturally falling across her back. They sleep like that peacefully until Clyde and Evee arrive two hours later. Maggie had checked on them when her and Arnold got back from the fieldes. She had seen them both dressed in there clothes from earlier sleeping ontop of the covers on the guest be. She had quietly entered the room and tucked them in with a spare blanket. She smiled softly as she watched May snuggle into Max more as the blanket fell across them. Then she softly left and closed the door behind her, before heading back downstairs and cooking a meal for her son and hopefully his fiance. ",1,1761845667.0,Maxwell_Isekaied,0,1.0,False

Let’s call her Donna and her husband Tony. TONY is not my bio grandpa. But she’s pushed me to call him papa my whole life. Tony is a pedo in my eyes. He’s always been creepy, saying gross inappropriate things, rude things, wanting front hugs, commenting on my outfits, and soooo much more (I literally made a list). 

January of this year i finally have enough so I told my grandma I didn’t want to be around him anymore (like at holidays she would invite me to) because of his behavior and she was super understanding. He has done these things to sooo many people, my sisters & brothers, my mom, any friends I’d bring over.. etc. we’ve all told my grandma multiple times and I was just done. 

Well, I got engaged and sent out my cards for my wedding and I sent one to her because I want her to go, she is my grandma after all even if her husband is trash. Well we usually have little coffee dates once a month with just her me and my sister. I go and my sister isn’t there yet and she asked me if Tony can come to the wedding, talking stuff like he’s watched you grow up, he really wants to go, blah blah blah. I strait up tell her I don’t want that because I may be forced to punch an old man at my wedding and I don’t want to do that. But eventually I say maybe we will see how things play out. She took that as yes and fast forward we have a funeral we have to attend. Tony is there and he is awful. AT A FUNERAL. So I text her and I say grandma I’m so sorry but Tony can’t come to the wedding. He can’t handle events and I don’t want to think about that on literally one of the biggest days of my life. Here’s the thing- he has dementia now. But to me he has been this way since my mother was a kid. His antics are nothing new dementia or not. She is pissed and sends back that I’m a terrible person for doing this and he’s wrecked because of it so she’s going to stand by him and also not come to my wedding. I say ok because if that’s the lesser evil so be it. 

Wedding goes off with out a hitch, and on my wedding day she’s posting about me on FACE BOOK. Yes my own great grandma who’s 77 lol. So I ask if we can go to coffee and just settle things and she finally agrees. She basically just tells me what dementia is and I tell her that my choice had nothing to do with his new found dementia and everything to do with who he’s always been. 

Anyways things have spiraled out of control now at the end of the coffee date she threw a card at me and stormed away. Now my whole family is divided. My mom and siblings are with me because they’ve all had and told her about Tony’s shiz, but some of my uncles don’t really get it and think I’ve cause a whole divide. They and my grandma arnt speaking with me. I’ve reached out multiple times to my grandma telling her our coffee dates are still always on the table even if I don’t want Tony around I can still be around her but nothing, she’s gone ghost and said she doesn’t want a relationship with someone who thinks like me. I’m starting to think I see exactly why she chose Tony in the first place and maybe her true colors are starting to show. AITAH? ",0,1761845351.0,AITAH,11,0.5,False

1ok6085,https://i.redd.it/mi9gq6gnaayf1.jpeg,My new Maxim La Siene,"Love my new machine.  It replaced my Bambino plus that I used with the Eureka Facile.  I was getting a bit weary of weighing out everything and also the limited control of the Bambino.

I followed the La Seine because it seemed to give me the features I was hoping for and had thought were way out of my price range.  There were some early machines sent to coffee guys online and I thought the reviews sounded good.  I was ready to jump and when the La Seine became available I got a discount for being one of the first 20 people to order.

The machine is made in China and though not as fancy as the expensive Italian machines, it does present a quality look and feel.  

Im still discovering all this machine can doth.  So far ive just used ""standard"" mode.  But ill mention some of the things I really like.

First off it violates one of the rules by having a built in grinder.  But I love it. I set it and insert my portafilter with funnel attached and it automatically weighs out the 17grams I have it set for.  I am using a setting of 17 on a
 scale of 1-70 this for a medium roast.

Likewise the brewing has a scale and will stop at the 36grams i have set.  It also displays the time so you immediately know how well you are dialed in and can easily adjust. 

The La Siene is a single boiler but has two thermoblocks attached so warm up time is 3 minutes and you can jump immediately to steam.

Beyond this the La Siene has adjustable temperature and adjustable pressure.  You can create your own ""curve""  say with pressure starting at 3 bars for 8 seconds then increasing to 9 bars and tailing off at the end.  

The steaming is pretty special too with an infrared temperature guage that scans the surface of the milk.  

I  am enjoying the heck out of this and consider it a real bargain. ",2,1761845305.0,espresso,0,0.75,False
1ok5z5y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ok5z5y,My CRH’ed American Small Cent Collection,"It’s unfortunate that I can’t get boxes anymore, but holding out that eventually there will be a great surplus to scour through once banks can’t send the bags back to distributors. 

So this is how I hold the nicer raw cents in my collection. It’s just some boxes of squared tubes with some taped-on information and decoration, but I think it’s pretty cool. It’s bittersweet, but it looks like I’ll have plenty of room for the “fun stuff” I search for in Box 4 🥲 It might be creepy, but I like the cents with fingerprints because it gives more weight to the perspective of the temporary ownership of the coin - you’re just one holder in a long lineage of holders. Anyways…

Initially I started with a “Box of Ages” as I liked to call it, I still hear Def Leppard every time I say it and that’s why it stuck🤣. It was just my first bank box, named in sharpie, with the beginning of rolls of copper by year. After a few more boxes hunted, I realized I couldn’t fit every year’s roll in the one box. So then I really caught the itch and all the copper went just into coffee cans as I did a bunch of speed-searching.  

After a while, the cans and old cheeseballs jugs got messy so I was rolling them up. As I was doing this, I decided to upgrade and make a shoebox with cardboard inserts to help keep the nice rolls organized. It was fun to make and some rolls were in more tightly than others, but it worked. But then it got heavy  as the rolls filled up and it began to flex when I would move it around with me.

The itch to hunt kept growing and I got more interested in errors and varieties beyond just the copper years, and the amount of wheats I had accumulated in my hunts had started growing to a point where I decided to expand. I bought 3 boxes of the square tubes and rebranded my “Box of Ages” to “Lincoln’s Legacy: A Century of Cents & Beyond”, printing out a nice picture for the top of the boxes and a mintage chart for the inside. I gave the shoebox to my kiddo for the start of his collection. 

It was nice and helped me stay organized during my hunts. Then I decided to further expand and add the earlier years with a fourth box. It took some rearranging and some more printing the sides and front and a new top with the rebrand to just “The American Small Cent” as pictured above. I also included some fun facts and included the mintages for 1855-1908. 

Looks like I’ll need to update to Box 4 to “2007-2025”, but I’ll be a hopelessly optimistic CRHer and procrastinate on that one (And I have nickel boxes as well, that I’m currently researching fun facts to tape inside of them between hunts - so I’d rather focus on that right now). 

All of this is CRH’ed with the exception of the IHCs, I’ve only ever found 1 in a roll from the bank. Thanks for reading and happy hunting while you can!!!",21,1761845243.0,CRH,6,1.0,False

1. Goût & Co
Micro-Roastery having a wide array very high quality beans, very light roast, excellent baristas. Owner has spent time in Paris, they work together with Substance. No Chinese beans. Beans available for sale in their bigger branch. In the smaller one more limited choice.

四川省成都市锦江区龙舟路二环路东五段 邮政编码: 610022

3. Youwei Coffee
Choice of three beans, the washed coffee tasted like a co-ferment. Not my cup of tea but it can surely be tasty there. 

Address:
四川省成都市金牛区黄忠路18-8号

Not tested but according to the Goût Barista very good:
The Chengdu coffee street with 3-4 great coffee shops next to each other. If I came to Chengdu that's where I might be hearing first! 

Address
四川省成都市锦江区点将台东街73号

You will find: 

Agua Coffee: Roaster of high quality beans, light but not ultralight 

Air Bus

Espre.so (or sth like that)

Zen Home (maybe sth like that)

One of those shops is supposed to do blends but in a good way so don't be put off by that and listen to the beans they blend together when you go there.

Your task this week is to celebrate darkness and shadows by mixing a cocktail which is - you guessed it - pitch black in hue. It would also be acceptable to use just one ingredient which is black, or a black garnish, or black glassware. It’s Halloween, do whatever carves your pumpkin!

There are several appropriate (if not somewhat gimmicky) alcohols on the market which are pitch black - black vodka, black rum, coffee or dark chocolate liqueurs, etc. I would also accept something “black label” even if the colour itself is not that dark. Mixers provide even more options; black coffee, black cola, black fruit juices such as cherry, or simply black food dye, which you’ll find on many store shelves this season. Black garnishes include liquorice (how frightful!) or even a [black olive](https://blog.thenibble.com/2014/06/08/recipes-cocktails-with-black-olives/) in place of the usual pimento-stuffed green.

So mix up a tongue-turning monochrome cocktail and enjoy a trick and a treat! Just do not take this post as an endorsement to get blackout drunk.

*October 29, 2025*

Okay, when I say ""his stuff"", I don't mean that we cordoned off areas that the other partner isn't allowed to go through. It's more like a natural evolution that things like papers, notebooks, etc, just end up piling up in a specific area.

The reason I don't go through them is just because there is nothing I need from them. Today was different. I needed his mini screwdriver set, and I knew it was in his office somewhere. I had texted him beforehand, and he couldn't remember exactly where he had put them, so he said just look around.

So I eventually find them on his book shelf, and as I'm picking them up, I set a piece of paper sticking out from one of the note books with my name in his hand writing.

My first thought is, ""Oh, this must be something he forgot to give me. Let me take it.""

What it was, was a list of different things I had said to him over the last few months. Things like ""I love you."", ""I love the way you smell."", ""Don't go, the bed is colder without you here."". Things I just said off without thinking, he had written down and dated with estimated time.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to go through the notebook I had found this piece of paper sticking out of. Turns out the notebook was a sketchbook, and he had drawn images of me in various poses like drinking coffee on the couch while reading, sleeping, staring out the window, laughing. (when I say images of me, I mean really romantacised images of me, because I don't even look that way on a good day, and believe me I don't have many good days).

The thing is I've never seen him pick up a pencil. I didn't even know he could draw. I've never seen him draw, especially not anything of me, but there it was.

In the sketch pad were also all these loose papers. Ideas for books, games, theories on the afterlife, reflections about life, society, romance, freaking time/space relativity! Drafts for short stories. Fully composed songs, with lyrics and music. A list of things that made me happy and things that made me sad. Special notes about traumatic events I had experienced in my life so he wouldn't forget. Notes about things we did together.

It was amazing, and fascinating, and enthralling, and most of all sad.

Because I didn't know any of this about him. Despite how long we've been together, I find it difficult to get him to open. Whenever I've tried to find out anything about him, he deflects it back to me. Try to find out what he wants to do? He wants to do what I want to do. I knew nothing about this part of his life, and not from lack of trying.

It's like I found out my husband has been living a double life, and I'm seriously wishing it was with another person. Because this hurts. I don't know why it hurts but it does. Badly.

I've put all the notes and drawings back. Tidied up. And I don't know what to do. I feel like if I ask him about it, he'll try drawing back deeper into his shell. Might even stop himself from doing any of this just in case I find it again. But I don't know if I can pretend that I don't know, what I now know.

TLDR: Found out my husband isn't who I thought he was.

*October 29, 2025, about 6 hours later*

I talked to my husband about this.

He was not happy that I posted this online before talking to him first.

As punishment I need to inform you all that I am the most dramatic drama queen that ever queened over drama.

But we sorted a lot of things out. 99% of it was just because of communication. ""Agreeing past, each other."" as he puts it.

He's also asked me to clear a few things up.

1. It's not *his* office, it's *the* office that he just mostly uses. Likewise, it's *the* bookcase. He wants to make sure it's understood that there is nowhere in our home that either of us don't feel welcomed.

2. If he really didn't want me to read those notebooks, he would've asked me not to. It is not my responsibility to figure out what is and isn't off limits. That's the point of communication.

3. Also, if he really wanted to hide them from me without me knowing, he can think of better places to put it than between World War Z and the Sandman Omnibus on our bookshelf.

4. He just never thought they would be interesting to me. He wasn't ashamed, or trying to hide a part of himself, he just honestly thought that those things were uninteresting.

5. He realises now that by doing that, it does seem like that he doesn't want to share his life with me. He always thought that when I was trying to get to know him better, or find out more about his life, or his interests, I was just being polite.

6. To those who said he has no obligation to share every part of his life, which is different from sharing *none* of his life with me. And even that is bullshit, because if he didn't want to share his whole life with me, why did we get married?

7. A lot of you said ""invasion of privacy"", but what if instead of something loving, there was something sinister like ""Ways to murder spouse and look like accident""? Would you have still said that? Refusing to investigate further into something that involves you because you might violate your partner's trust is denial at best, ignorance at worst.

8. Some of you have an idealised way of how you think relationships should work.

9. Some of you have never been in a relationship.

10. Some of you should never be in a relationship.

11. Not dismissing the idea of a counsellor, just think it's a bit extreme. In this situation, it was because of communication. Just because you hear hoofbeats, don't automatically think zebras.

12. Don't know whether to be insulted or proud of the fact that some you think this is AI

13. The planet is on fire, and fascism is everywhere and you're worried about something that might be 'karma farming'? Can we exchange lives, because if that's what makes you froth at the mouth then you live on easy street compared to the rest of us.

Second Edit: The 13 bulleted points are not mine, they are what my husband asked me to put in, that's why I started the list by saying *He's also asked me to clear a few things up.*.

Hi, I am Rohan Singh a aspiring writer who is about to write his own book and I got this idea from my chaddi buddy named Purohit Sal. This is because once I get famous from my book, I will publish this diary and avoid the effort to write or hire a ghost writer for an auto biography. I am in collage and in the final year my parent mainly my father advise me to study for the exams and he even says he will let me become a writer but first I have to pass the final exam and he is probably right but I am going to write my book and study for my exams by the way my book is called Aiko and it is a mafia story and I have been writing mafia stories since I was in middle school. I am leaving for my collage class so I will see you later.

The class was so boring the professor gave so many notes that make no sense for example he wrote The heart is a plumbing blood like what does that mean is my heart a plumber now, but now I can write my story, I have written the first page it is just the protagonist I named Aska, Nice name, right? Anyway, Aska is now taking his badge and joining Aiko which is the mafia group and then Bla Bla Bla, I am not spoiling my story if you want to know go buy my book which will be available as this diary will be released after my book gets famous.

Now I have invited Riya on a coffee and  I was so nervous that I wrote will you come with for a papad because my mother just told me to bring papad that same moment but I delated it and wrote a good message written by ChatGPT and It was good ( I am saying this was good so that I will be spared with robots do take over.) I will reveal you something, I have a crush on Riya but not yet told her as I will tell her on the last day of collage so I don’t get embarrassed in collage every day because I know that she will reject a nerd writer like me. Why I think like this because I don’t have any friend in my collage because everyone thinks I am a boring boy who will not do anything interesting but the people who have grown up with a golden card will understand anything about books.

Purohit is my childhood friend and the only chance I have on Riya is that she kind of a nerd.",1,1761844846.0,DestructiveReaders,1,1.0,False

I’m concerned for his health if this is a medical issue or if it is something else, but he just keeps saying he’s fine.

Posting this uncleaned transcript of that polyam update video and pulling out this quote. Um, people aren't collectible. The point is meaningful connections, no? It's not a game to collect 'em all. For someone who labels themself pansexual they sure do put a lot of emphasis on gender and orientation. Perhaps my understanding on pansexuality is misguided.

Transcript:
Hi. Hello. It's me, Saturn. I went on two dates yesterday and I kind of want to talk about them and just my dating history right now, what I'm going through. So I was talking to a couple for a while and ultimately it didn't work out. I would be interested in dating a couple again in the future. I'm not interested in dating a couple that only has a one penis policy. Not my thing. Otherwise. I am talking to a few people right now very casually, and one of them I've been seeing since April. Our first date was actually the Midday Parade concert that I went to on my birthday weekend in April, and we've been seeing each other since. And I quite like him. I'm currently sitting outside of a coffee shop waiting for him to show up. I went back to his house last night. And we were getting coffee and we drove separately because he has to go to work afterwards. But yeah. Quite like him. I also went on a first date yesterday with a guy that's been in my friend's circle for a while. So I know him and we really hit it off on the date, so I'm excited to have a second date with him. He is, like, really close friends with one of my exes. One of my exes that I'm still friends with. We're all on the same friend circle, so that's interesting. Me and Eli are doing really well. We're actually having a little date night tonight. I'm really excited about it, and I'm talking to this girl that I'm really excited about, and I'm talking to a trans mask, non binary person. And hive. I've been seeing that person for, like, four months now as well. So, yeah, I've been dating. I'm arguably dating, like, too many people right now. Casually seeing them dating. Not, like, labeled partnership dating, but I'm really just trying to lock down, like, a second relationship. It's cuffing season and kind of, like, slow down on everything else a little bit. So we'll see. But, yeah, this one guy that I'm seeing that I'm crashing hard on, I've been seeing since my birthday weekend of April, and. I really like him. And I hate that it's another man. Thankfully, no one I'm seeing we're talking to is straight. Y'all know me. I don't fuck with straight men. If I'm dating a man. They're a little fruity, okay. Yeah. I don't know. I'm just happy. And it was cool being able to go on a date yesterday. And. Literally, one partner left while the other one showed up, which was really cool. And so they met each other, and they were like, oh, hey, nice to meet you. Polyamory is cool. And I've been really enjoying dating again for the first time in a long time. Yeah. I feel like when I was dating Cade and stuff like that, like, Haley, I love both of them. I fell in love with both of them, and they're phenomenal people. But I don't think that I was really locked in because I was just like, I want a partner. And so I was, like, rushing. And just doing whatever I could do to get a partner. And now I've been being more intentional with my time and prioritizing myself and my established partners and my family. And taking things really slow. I've been seeing this guy since around the time I started seeing Cade, and we're still seeing each other and don't have a label on our relationship, and that is. Incredible. So I don't know. I don't know the point to this video. I kind of just wanted to ramble and talk about my dating escapades right now while I fidget with my pop socket. Yeah. Anyways, he just pulled up, so we're gonna go into this coffee shop and get breakfast at Coffee. Because we had a little bit of a late night last night. I think we went to bed at, like, midnight. We need coffee to power us through. Okay, I'm excited to update you guys, and I haven't asked any of them yet if they're comfortable being in my content, so if they're not, you'll never see them. But if they are, maybe you'll meet some of them soon. Okay, Bye. I hope everyone has a wonderful day. ",7,1761844555.0,sinnabunnysnark,3,1.0,False
1ok5o7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1ok5o7l/any_advice_after_gastroscopy_with_biopsy_and/,Any advice after gastroscopy with biopsy and inflammation of stomach?,"Hey everyone, 

today I had my gastroscopy, after being too afraid to do it for 15 years and rapidly escalating symptoms since start of September.

The gastroscopy went extremely well, went under quickly and woke up feeling as if only moments went by. 

They told me I have an inflammation in my upper stomach, they are not sure yet if it's bacteria or not and since the lab in Germany doesn't with tomorrow due to a national holiday, I'll only get that info sometime next week. 

To me there now seems to be a 50:50 chance of it being an easy things to fix with antibiotics or being a chronic thing?

In addition I seem to have two polyps in the stomach, which need to get taken out in January (or if I can find another doctor to do it earlier) earlier.

I'm currently in a pretty bad mental state. Not much different food, not much tasty stuff since start of September, twice a day PPIs and even additional stuff. No coffee, no sugar, mostly no fruits and such. Makes me really depressed and I already have a medical history of severe depression. 

My gf cooks and she gives it her all, really does, but still I'm quite down at the moment, getting pangs of jealousy whenever she eats stuff I can't have and such. 

So basically this is about to screw my whole life over. I'm not too sure what to do, what to eat to get a little joy back into my life (I drew much joy from eating nice food, either cooked by my gf or from restaurants) or to be able to accept this better.

Also ... I'm currently uncomfortable, having slight stomach pain and worse heartburn than the last few days. 

Any advice what I might do is very much welcome. Not only recipes, but really anything that might help.",1,1761844555.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

A few quick facts about me:
• I’m not the clingy or overly bubbly type — more of the calm, grounded, “I’ll handle it myself” kind
• Strong, independent, and a bit stoic — but I open up once the conversation’s real.
• I’m honest with my words — I don’t sugarcoat, but I’m never rude for no reason.
• Coffee is basically part of my DNA.
• Dog person
• Not planning to have kids — I prefer my peace, sleep, and quiet mornings intact.
• Agnostic — I respect all beliefs but prefer keeping faith personal and uncomplicated.
• Not into politics much; I’d rather save my energy for things I can actually control.
• My humor’s on the darker side — if you can laugh at life’s nonsense without taking offense, we’ll get along fine. (But I sometimes throw some corny jokes out of the blue)
• I like random conversations that turn unexpectedly deep… or sarcastic. Either works.
• Not here for drama — just looking for good company, genuine talks, and people who can match my energy.

What I’m Looking For:
• Someone who’s grounded, real, and emotionally mature. I appreciate people who can communicate honestly without turning everything into drama. 
• I’m drawn to calm energy (not overbearing) — the kind of person who doesn’t need constant attention, but shows up when it matters.
• soft, 'good-boy' type who knows how to treat people with respect and doesn’t see gentleness as a weakness.
• Bonus points if you’ve got a dry sense of humor and can appreciate sarcasm without taking it personally.
• Not looking for someone perfect — just someone real, kind, and easy to be around.

If you think we’d get along, message me. I’m always up for a good chat.

P.S. Looking for meaningful connection only. No hookup stuff, thanks.",0,1761844527.0,PhR4Dating,0,0.5,False

# Training

Had been carrying a few niggles. tendinopathy kept me out for 6 months early 2024. Got back at it and then got some pretty significant hip pain. Physio really helped me. Did the Dublin City half in March in  1:44;29. I was delighted with that. I then went after a 5mile race in May and did it in 34:43. Felt really good but hip flared up again so didn't run apart from Park Run for a couple of months. Got a marathon transfer at the end of July and slowly built up my km's. My routine was a 10/15 on Mon/Tues, 10 Wed, parkrun saturday and a long on a Sunday. I really enjoyed the focus and the training. Hip and tendon were niggly at times but I felt pretty good. I did a 30k Sept 14th and the dublin 1/2 sept 21st 1:43:44.  Sept 28th I got my new Megablast and did 34k and felt great. pace was 5:25. Did wonders for my confidence for the big one.  I then did a little 10k on Oct 1st and hurt my calf. That was pretty much the end of my training block. Did not do my head well. I was so freaked I wouldn't be able to run it. I did a couple of 10kms and it was sore but I knew I could run on it, the fear was that it would blow up at 30k. Went to the physio and he said my hip was looking good as I had evidently been doing all my exercises but the miles had added up and taken its toll on my calf. he said rest was better than pushing the miles in prep so I took his advice. I did a couple of 5ks and 10ks but that was it in the 3 and a bit weeks leading up to it after my long 34k.

# Pre-race

It was hard really focussing on prep as I was so worried my leg wouldn't hold out but I got in the mindset and did some carb loading. Nothing too hectic, just pasta for dinner the previous 2 nights etc. I was training with a couple of friends and it was great to be texting back and forth about what we were doing and eating etc. I made sure I got to bed early enough the previous week which definitely helped (need to do that as more of a routine anyway).  
Up at 6am. Porridge & banana. Forgot to eat a bagel. Pinned my bib on, checked my fuel 1000 times and then the person I was giving a lift to knocked at 7. Picked up a couple of other friends on the way and I found a perfect parking spot by the national concert hall.  
Friend who had done it before warned me to get in early. Couldn't believe we pretty much did about 3000 steps going the loop around to the bag drop! Was proper feeling the buzz of the race. Was excited and nervous but knew I had a prepared as much as I could. couple of my friends were in wave 1 so we said good luck to them, another couple in wave 2 and 3 of us made our way to wave 3. I went for a wee about 4 times. so glad I brought a crappy zippy top cause it was very cold before the race started. Rain started to fall about 5 mins before the wave 3 gun which was disappointing.

# Race

I was determined to run my own race. I aimed to do 5:30 pace and not go out too quick. I did just that. Felt pretty good enjoying the buzz of it. Had nice chilling tunes in my ears low enough so I could hear the crowd too. Just as we entered the park I felt a little niggle in my knee and I thought 'this is new but it'll ease off'. I kept going. The crowd in castleknock were unreal and I kept cruising at the pace I wanted. The hill coming up to Inchicore was a bit of a killer but I did a couple of 5:20 splits and again, was feeling good. Then coming up toward the Crumlin Road at 21km I felt a hot poker type pain in my knee. Again, thought it would ease off but it didn't. Rain pelting in my face, a long wide road that just felt so so grim. 5:43, then 6:02, then 5:49, then 6:10. I tried so hard to get back in to the groove but just couldn't. The pain was bad. I knew my wife and kids were at 29km. I felt a rush of overwhelm and tears at the thought of seeing them (odd how these things happen!). The Templeogue road which I run on very often just felt so so long. They greeted me with a gorgeous sign and jellies and electrolytes and told me to keep going and I could do it. My body wanted to stop right there but my head told me to keep pushing even though the thoughts of 13 more km was very overwhelming. Keep going I did though. One lady on heartbreak hill shouted my name and said 'keep going!'. Moments like that just meant the world to me. Splits were about 6:30 until about 39k when they hit 7km. My body was so close to being done. the last couple of km were so tough. I took my headphones out and just listened to the crowd.  finally I could see the finish line and no joke, about 50m before it my hamstring just fully seized and I couldn't run. johns ambulance person came over but I asked her to just let me walk in myself (the video of the finish line is kinda funny). I crossed the line at 4:11:51.

(I took - 6 gels, 4 paracetamol, 1 lucozade, some water and 4 jelly babies!)

# Post-race

I had thought I'd vibe disappointed with anything less than 4 hours but my first feeling was pride. I was so proud I pushed through and got over the finish line. Then all I wanted to do was see my family. I went to bag drop and the woman was so kind. I was a bit teary. Then I saw our parkrun director which was brill - he's a gem and it was great to see him and he was so encouraging. Finally met the family and the feeling was unreal. We then went to a coffee shop and met my two buddies and their families and we all had hot chocolate. I was so proud of them and their times - they smashed it.  
Hard to put words on the real feeling afterwards. I have a whole new appreciation for anyone who even attempted a marathon, never mind finish it. Anything can happen in a training block or on the course and it can be pure luck between pushing on and dropping out. I feel lucky I was able to keep going. I know 3:50 is in me so I'll be signing up for next year. the whole experience was also a reminder of how lovely most people are. from the volunteers to the other runners to the supporters along the way. It brings out the best in people and Dublin was just mega.",2,1761844431.0,firstmarathon,0,1.0,False

*Grab your coffee, this is gonna be wild...*

**A quick intro**: I'm from Argentina and I usually write articles in Spanish for my sub. Every now and then I write in English because I'm interested in learning more from different perspectives and viewpoints. I used Claude to help me translate this piece.



Hey there, writing this late at night making friends. Maybe I'm wrong (and more than one person is gonna come at me) but I wanted to write this given what's about to go down. I don't think the same about all companies—for example, Anthropic has a better business plan TODAY in my opinion. But since I could be wrong, you tell me what you think at the end...

# [The IPO of the Century (or How to Sell Snake Oil at Gold Prices)](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-lays-groundwork-juggernaut-ipo-up-1-trillion-valuation-2025-10-29/)

Grab your coffee, this is gonna be rough...

So it turns out that OpenAI, that little company that's been burning through cash like there's no tomorrow, has decided that the best course of action is... to go public with a valuation of ONE TRILLION DOLLARS!

Yeah, you read that right. A trillion. With a T for ""They're screwing you"" and ""Tremendous nerve.""

# The Art of Selling the Oven While It's Still On Fire

Picture this: you've got a company that's basically a money vacuum. Cash goes in one end, smoke comes out the other. Annual revenue is around $20 billion (nothing to sneeze at, mind you), but the losses... ah, the losses are also ""growing."" Beautiful euphemism, isn't it? Like saying the Titanic was ""taking on water.""

So what do you do in that situation? If you said ""try to become profitable,"" you clearly don't understand how modern capitalism works. The correct answer is: GO PUBLIC WITH AN INSANE VALUATION!

# The Million (of Millions) Dollar Excuse

Sam Altman, with that smile that makes you suspect he knows something you don't, says: ""It's the most likely path, given the capital needs we'll have.""

Translation for humans: ""Yo, we need A LOT of money. Like, billions. And the only way to get it without looking bad is to make the general public foot the bill.""

Because of course, to keep burning money... sorry, I mean, to keep ""investing in AI infrastructure,"" they need more capital. It's like that friend who asks to borrow money to pay off the credit card, which they got to pay off the loan, which they took out to pay off... you know how it ends.

# Altman's Double Narrative: Playing Both Sides

**For the believers** (investors, tech press, fanboys): ""We need billions to build the Stargates and reach AGI. We're the pioneers, the visionaries who will change the world.""

**For those of us who can read balance sheets**: ""We need to dilute risk because this isn't sustainable without others paying for our party.""

And here comes the genius of the operation: Altman's gonna say ""Yeah, but look at the dot-coms. The bubble burst, but the infrastructure remained and then changed the world.""

# The Monorail Trick

Remember that Simpsons episode with the monorail? A charismatic salesman (Lyle Lanley) convinces all of Springfield to spend their savings on a useless monorail, collects his commission, and leaves on the first train while everything falls apart.

Well, this has all the hallmarks, but with better marketing:

**The real play:**

* Insiders (VCs, employees with options) have ""fantasy paper shares"" valued in the billions
* Those shares are only worth something if you can find someone willing to buy them
* The IPO is finding that ""someone"": pension funds, your uncle who watched a finance video on TikTok, your neighbor who thinks he's Warren Buffett
* They sell at the peak of the hype, walk away with real cash, and leave everyone else holding the bag

# The Infrastructure Trap

Altman's right about one thing: the infrastructure will remain. The problem is **for whom**.

**What happened with the dot-coms:**

* Yes, infrastructure remained (fiber optic cables, data centers, etc.)
* But investors who bought [Pets.com](http://Pets.com), Webvan, and eToys at the IPO **lost everything**
* Who inherited that infrastructure? Amazon, Google, and others who bought it at fire-sale prices

**Translation to OpenAI:**

* The Stargates might get built
* But those who buy shares at $1 trillion in the IPO are gonna lose their money
* When the bubble bursts, Microsoft or another big tech will buy the assets for pennies on the dollar
* The infrastructure will be useful... but not for you, IPO investor

It's like investing all your money in building a luxury building, going bankrupt, and the bank keeping it for the debt. Yes, the building exists and is useful. But you're out on the street.

# Employees Going Full Promo Mode

Just—but JUST—before the IPO, suddenly a bunch of OpenAI employees start showing up in interviews or dropping tweets (sorry, on X) saying ""We're SO close to AGI! It's a matter of months!""

Coincidence? Hmmm...

About as much of a ""coincidence"" as every used car salesman telling you the car they want to sell you ""is a gem, owned by a little old lady, never a taxi.""

**Why employees and not Altman?**

Because Altman already burned his credibility:

* ChatGPT-5 didn't arrive with the promised quantum leap
* ""AGI by 2025"" went up in smoke
* Every time he speaks, fewer people believe him

So he needs **fresh voices**, new faces, to maintain the hype. It's pure narrative pumping.

And those employees also have stock options. Every point the valuation goes up at the IPO means millions in their pockets. You think they're gonna come out and say ""Hey, the truth is we're hitting a technological plateau and we don't know if this scales""?

# The Cruel Math of Fictional Valuation

Let's run the numbers because otherwise it seems like I'm exaggerating:

* **Annualized revenue**: \~$20 billion
* **Proposed valuation**: $1 trillion
* **Price/Sales ratio**: 50x

For this to make any sense, OpenAI would have to:

1. Become profitable (today it's bleeding money)
2. Maintain exponential growth for years
3. Absolutely dominate all AI markets
4. AGI has to be real, achievable, and monetizable

**Probability of all that happening**: About the same as the Cubs winning 10 World Series in a row.

It's like valuing the corner diner at $50 million because ""someday it could be McDonald's."" Technically possible in a parallel universe, practically delusional in this one.

# The Timing: Racing Against the Clock of Reality

The IPO is planned for 2026-2027. Coincidence? Suspicious...

**Why right now?**

Because they know that:

* The technological plateau is real (even Karpathy admitted it, and that guy's no hater)
* Energy costs are unsustainable (you need a nuclear plant to train a model)
* The hype window is closing faster than blinds when you see Jehovah's Witnesses

**The play**: Go public before the market realizes that:

* AGI isn't around the corner (it's several corners away, in another neighborhood, maybe another city)
* The business model doesn't scale without massive subsidies
* The losses are structural, not ""temporary investments""

It's the corporate version of musical chairs: while the music plays (the AI hype), everyone dances happily. The trick is not being the sucker left standing when the music stops.

# The Philosophical Contradiction of the 21st Century

Let's pause to appreciate the absurd beauty of this: a company that LOSES MONEY wants to be valued at a trillion dollars.

It's like if your cousin who never paid you back the $100 told you: ""Look, I know I owe you money, but let me sell you my 'future income potential' for, say, $10 million?""

And the craziest thing is it'll probably work. Because in the world of tech bubbles, reality is negotiable but hype is unquestionable.

# Is Altman a Visionary Genius or a Monorail Salesman?

This is the million (of millions, literally) dollar question.

And the most likely answer is: **both at the same time**. And that's what makes him dangerous.

Altman probably **genuinely believes** in AGI. He drinks his own Kool-Aid. He's convinced he's going to change the world.

But he **also** knows he needs to exit before it's proven whether he was right or not. He's the ""True Believer Grifter"": he believes in his story, but he's still selling you smoke.

It's like that friend who invites you to an MLM. He really believes you're gonna be a millionaire selling cleaning products. But he also needs you to join so he gets his commission.

# The Great Referendum of Narrative vs. Reality

If this IPO succeeds, it'll be the financial equivalent of all humanity voting ""yes, we believe the earth is flat."" It'll be confirmation that you can sell anything, at any price, if the story you tell is epic enough.

""Losses? Nah bro, those are 'investments in the future'."" ""Unsustainable expenses? Nope, that's 'building infrastructure for AGI'."" ""Broken business model? Not at all, it's 'disruptive growth'.""

# Takeaway Moral

Next time someone tells you that you don't understand modern finance, remember this story. Remember that a company that functions as a capital black hole is trying to convince the world it's worth a trillion dollars.

**OpenAI's IPO isn't an investment opportunity. It's a risk transfer.**

Those who buy at the IPO aren't buying a company. They're buying:

* A narrative
* A promise
* A speculative bet
* The right to be the ""greater fool"" holding the valuation while insiders cash out

And when it explodes (not ""if,"" **when**), the Altmans, the VCs, and the employees with options will already be on the beach, counting their real money.

IPO investors will be holding paper shares that were once worth $1 trillion... until they weren't.

It'll be like that Simpsons episode: Springfield is left with a useless monorail, and Lyle Lanley is in Tahiti drinking piña coladas.

*Grab another coffee and sit back to watch how this movie ends. Spoiler: probably not well for those who buy at the IPO.*

**Disclaimer 2**: If you're thinking about buying OpenAI shares at the IPO because ""AGI is gonna change the world,"" please, just give me that money instead. At least I'll buy you a burger.",0,1761844359.0,economy,0,0.4,False

I live in the Netherlands. I've been taking 100mg sertraline since March - started with 50mg and my psychiatrist increased it since then. She never properly evaluated me, she prescribed it because I have compulsive behaviors and was depressed due to my disability and parental divorce. I also take 20mg of propranolol for hand tremors because of my CMT.

My main complaint is that I am exhausted, all the time; this has been going on for around 2 months. I try to sleep 9hrs regularly, I fall asleep around/after midnight but I get enough sleep. I go to university every day for 2hrs only, but I can barely stay awake for lectures, I'm always told I look tired. February to April I had months of sleep deprivation because I couldn't sleep due to my depression. I can fall asleep just about anywhere in any situation, no matter how much I slept; except sometimes when I'm trying to sleep at night. Coffee usually makes me sleepier. I can't focus on any kind of tasks, I'm incredibly forgetful, and disorganized. My body feels heavy, slow, and I'm just insanely sleepy.

My stress levels are lower now, I moved out 3 months ago, and I'm dealing better with my physical state; yet this sleepiness is a huge stress factor because I cannot study for my exams. I don't do a lot of exercise because I recently had screws removed from my knee after TTO and MPFL surgery. I want to, but it doesn't feel like I can because of my lack of energy. 

Even when I sleep, I don't feel like I did when I wake up - I dream vividly and often have traumatizing nightmares. Literally the second I fall asleep I start dreaming. I have a lot of difficulty waking up.

My psychiatrist said it's not because of the sertraline but because of my environment - I think my environment is okay. She never diagnosed me properly so I'm looking for a new one who could properly help. I got blood work done to check my thyroid, vitamin D, hemoglobin, and iron.  
Everything was fine except my vitamin-D being lower and my iron too, but not that bad.

I feel like something is really wrong here but I keep being told it's nothing and it'll go away if I sleep more or take vitamins. Doctor said it might be anemia - blood test ruled it out. I've heard various suggestions what it could be: ADHD, narcolepsy, serotonin syndrome, sleep apnea, side effects of sertraline, etc. I'm so lost, I'd really appreciate if someone could help me make sense of all this.",1,1761844314.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I'm sorry the story is long, there will be a TLDR at the end. This is only a summary of the important events. There is much more, but, for the sake of time I cut them out.

I grew up in a small city and attended the local community college. When I was there, I met another student from the same college on the online forums. I'll call her Sara. Sara seemed friendly and we decided to meet in person and go for coffee. We did and she seemed normal enough. She was  in her early 20s at the time, a few years older than me and was the single Mom of a little girl who was around 1 y/o. I'll call her Jessica. Sara's story was the typical, got pregnant too young, her bf took off once she told him she was pregnant, she's going at it alone, and trying to improve their life by going to college. I admired her drive to improve the situation at the time. She lived in family student housing which was close to our college, but, on the other side of town than me as I still lived at home with my parents. 

I drove and had a mini van. So after classes, sometimes I would drive Sara and Jessica to do grocery shopping/general errands, and at the time, I really didn't mind. I watched her count her pennies as money was tight and I truly felt bad for her. I organized a bottle drive on the same forum where we met, to try and raise money for her. We ended up raising nearly $500, which I used to buy her a gift card at Walmart. I knew she wasn't allowed to receive cash without reporting it, decreasing her funding. But, I looked it up with our school and she was allowed to receive gift cards without reporting so I felt this was the best solution. When I gave her the gift card and told her about the bottle drive, which I spent my own gas money to drive all over town and collect, she seemed really appreciative. 

One day she asked if I would be willing to babysit on a Friday night while she went out with other friends. I get it. She deserves a night off. But, I really needed to study for an exam and she gave me an elaborate story about how she really needed this and she would make sure Jessica was asleep so I could study. I agreed. I showed up to her apartment at 9pm as requested. Not only was Jessica not sleeping, she was screaming in her crib when I walked in. Sara said that she cried herself to sleep and it would be fine. Sara runs out to go to the bar with her friends. After a while, Jessica was still screaming and crying. Now, at this point, I had not much experience looking after babies. I went in to try and comfort her, when I picked her up, she felt overly warm. I tried to look for a thermometer but I couldn't find one. At that moment, Sara calls. I tell her that I think Jessica has a fever and ask where the thermometer is. At  this point she says she's fine. She already knew she had a fever, but, didn't tell me. She told me where the Tylanol was and to give it to Jessica. I did. After hours of comforting Jessica, she finally fell asleep in my arms, but would wake up and cry whenever I tried to put her down. I didn't get any studying done that night and finally got her to go to sleep in her crib about 15 mins before Sara came home. When Sara came home she acted like nothing was wrong. I tried to tell her I was kind of upset she didn't tell me her kid was sick before she left and she said, ""If I would have told you before, you wouldn't have agreed to babysit and I wanted to go out."" I was mad but over time I brushed it off.

About a month later, it's now Christmas break and a lot of my friends were back in town from being away at University. I planned to have a gaming night with one of my male friends. Sara calls and asks me to look after Jessica. At first I said no, she asked why, and I told her about my plans. She told me to just have my friend over at her place and she promised that Jessica will be asleep and she needs me ""urgently.""  Guess what, she's still wide awake when my friend and I arrive. This time she seems content.... until she sees my friend and she starts to scream and cry. Sara doesn't seemed phased by it and once again, rushes out the door. My friend has younger siblings and has more experience with babies than I. We do all the typical checks, with no luck. When she got distracted by something, she would slowly stop crying- but- my friend noticed something I did not. She would only scream and cry when she looked directly at my friend. He wants to see what will happen, so he ""pretends"" to leave the apartment. He walks out the door and Jessica goes back to normal. But as soon as my friend walks in- she screams and cries again. We knew it was because of him, but, we thought perhaps she didn't like strangers. Sara calls- I tell her that I think it's weird that Jessica only cries when she looks at my friend. That's when Sara dropped the bombshell. Jessica is afraid of men in general due to previous abuse. What? I was mad. I told her that was irresponsible of her then to agree to let me have my male friend and I watch her child if the child is afraid of men. She was aware my friend was a man, but she ""really needed this night out."" What? She needed me urgently to go drinking at the bar? Once again- I was mad- but there was nothing I could do about it at that moment. At one point, I was holding Jessica's hands as she walked in front of me up and down the hallway. She couldn't walk fully on her own yet. She walked up to the door of the spare room. (She had a 3 bedroom apartment- she said family housing at school let her stay there because there weren't any 2 bedrooms available.) I opened the door, thinking it was an empty room that Jessica wanted to walk around in- but what I found shocked me. It was an empty room with no furniture, but, there were Walmart bags shoved in the corner and her shopping scattered all over the floor. There were new women's clothes, make up, hair stuff, and electronics scattered all over the floor. All this stuff had brand-new tags from Walmart. I saw the receipt on the floor and picked it up. It was dated the day after I had given her the gift card, the total came to just shy of $500. These items were all for her. I didn't even know what to say. The rest of the evening was just me trying to get Jessica to sleep and my friend trying to stay out of sight so Jessica wouldn't get upset. Once again, I got her to sleep in her crib about 15 mins before Sara walked in acting like nothing was wrong. My friend and I left. I didn't answer any calls from her ever again and essentially ended the friendship. I moved on with life and haven't thought about this Sara in years.

Fast forward to today. I no longer live in that city-but- I live in a larger city that is close to the one that I grew up in. Somehow Sara found me on facebook and sent me a message. I exchanged small talk and I asked about Jessica as she's a young adult now. Well, Jessica had a teen pregnancy and was a Mom with the same story as Sara. Sara pointed out that we all live in the same city now. Great.... It wasn't long before Sara asked me to come over and watch her grandson so her and Jessica could go out. I instantly blocked both of them. I did not want a repeat of last time.

  
AIO? When telling the story to a friend they said that I should have helped out as it was for Jessica, not Sara, and I shouldn't punish Jessica for what her mother did. I agree with that, but, I didn't have a relationship with Jessica at all anymore. The last time I saw her, she was a baby-it was her Mom asking for the babysitting favor.... not Jessica.

  
TLDR: In college a friend took advantage of me for babysitting. I cut ties. Baby grew up and had her own baby and now that friend is asking for the same babysitting favors for her grandchild. I blocked them.",1,1761844242.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.67,False

He shared a French press method that’s super easy and gives amazing results:

Use 15 grams of coffee and pour in 225 ml of water at about 94 to 96°C.
Start a timer for 4 minutes. When it’s up, you will see a crust on top  gently break it with a spoon.
Then wait another 6 minutes. After that, press the plunger down slowly. Don’t worry, with the Blue Tokai press you won’t disturb the bottom much.

Your coffee will be around 70°C when it’s ready, and you’ll actually be able to taste the different notes in each coffee from the explorer pack.

To know when your water’s around 94°C, just turn off the heat right when you see small bubbles forming before it starts boiling.

1ok5h6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1ok5h6y/my_kids_halloween_costume_is_alive/,My Kid's Halloween Costume is Alive,"I made Halloween costumes for my kids. In the past, this was something my wife and I did together. It was a tradition. Sadly, my wife passed away recently, so this year’s Halloween felt heavy. I wanted to make it extra special for the kids – an exercise in futility, I know – but you can’t blame a dad for trying.   

  

My kids are eight and twelve: Nick, the oldest, is my son, and Edith is my eight-year-old daughter. Great kids. After watching Wizard of Oz for the umpteenth time, Edith decided to dress up as Glinda the Good. With the aid of many Youtube tutorials, I stitched up a sparkling witch’s costume. It looked splendid.

 

Then there was Nick’s costume.   

  

Nick was adamant: he wanted to be a robot for Halloween. He loves robots. Always has. Seemed harmless enough.



Little did I know.



For starters, we needed a large box for the body. Fortunately, I’d recently purchased a new dishwasher, so I used the box it came with. Fit like a dream. I found a smaller box for the robot’s head. Many other objects were required: flexible ducts, a Slinky, glass bottles and caps, spray can lids, and a plethora of throw-away computer parts. Plenty of tinfoil and silver spray paint were also used.

  

The kid's costume looked fantastic. Nick was ecstatic. His big blue eyes blew up like balloons. I’d truly outdone myself. 

  

The day before Halloween, their school had a costume party. Edith, who’s both stubborn and shy, refused to dress up. I wasn’t surprised; she’d been acting out lately, ever since her mother died. Nick, on the other hand, couldn’t contain his excitement. 



When he came down for breakfast that morning, I nearly died. His costume seemed so realistic; it fit him like a dream. The lights attached to his chest were blinking, and the gauges were moving. (Did I attach a battery?) His face was painted to precision. You’d be hard pressed to recognize him. He even walked like a robot: CLINK, CLUNK, CLANK.



It was seven o’clock in the morning; I was astounded. I watched, transfixed, as he ambled towards the fridge, found the milk jug, and poured himself a tall glass. He gulped it down, then sat awkwardly at the table.  

 

“Breakfast!” he demanded, sounding more machine than human.  

  

I spit out my coffee, soaking my crotch; the coffee was scorching, so I charged into the washroom and cleaned up. I didn’t trust the sound of the boy’s voice. It sounded cruel and inhumane. And it was two octaves lower. 



Just my imagination, I told myself. 

  

I gathered my nerves and returned to the kitchen. To my surprise, the boy fixed himself some cereal and toast. Not a big feat, of course, except he never does that. Ever. Despite my constant nagging. Maybe he’s learning, I reminded myself. I was the same way at his age.  

  

He devoured his breakfast, and belched. It stank like a rusted old train. He released a laugh so diabolical, it made my skin crawl. He belched again, then marched towards the fridge and came out with a full bottle of Coke. He emptied the entire bottle of pop down his throat. The belch that followed could be heard by the neighbors.   

  

I was gobsmacked. Why was he acting this way? Many thoughts crashed through my mind:   

  

Maybe the costume was giving him confidence?   

  

Maybe something happened at school – something I don’t know about – and he’s deflecting?  



Maybe the costume was cursed.



I was overreacting. He’s still a kid, and he’s acting strangely. No biggie. Heck, he’s still reeling from the loss of his mother. It would be weird for him not to be acting out. I told myself this, but I didn’t believe it.  

  

Edith came moping into the kitchen.   

  

“What’s up, sweetie?” I asked, trying to sound cheerful.   

  

She shrugged.   

  

“Hungry?” I asked.  

  

She plopped onto the kitchen chair, her red hair spilling across her freckled face. She looked at me and sniffled.  Meanwhile, the rickety robot was ravaging everything in the refrigerator. Nick started teasing her, and calling her names.  

  

“Nick!” I snapped. “Watch your mouth!”

  

The robot stood upright, “Or what?”  

  

He was so tall, it was shocking. The boy was due for a growth spurt, but this was ridiculous. I bit my tongue. 



Edith looked terrified. “Daddy,” she sobbed, “make him stop.”  

  

Despite my trepidation, I fake-laughed, hoping to lighten the mood, then I gathered their belongings and shooed them off to school. 

  

Work was hectic. I spent all day doing maintenance – which in itself is a nightmare – so I was busy, busy, busy. That afternoon, I received a platoon of texts from Amy, who runs their daycare. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it), I was too busy to check my phone, so I didn’t read them until I was parked in her driveway. And by then, it was too late.

 

When I entered the daycare, I smelled feces. No wonder. It was spread across the living room walls, like chunky brown paint. I  gagged.

 

Amy was red-faced and furious. “DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BOY!”



The boy was chasing kids around the house, throwing poop at them. The kids seemed terrified. 

 

Edith rushed over and hugged me; her face was withered from bawling.   

  

“Daddy,” she sniffled, “Nick is being bad.”   



Nick – still in his robot costume – had some poor kid in a full-nelson (a wrestling move he’d recently learned). He picked the kid up over his head and started spinning him. The poor kid was wailing. 



“Nick!” I shouted. “Knock it off!”  



I couldn’t believe my eyes. Normally, Nick’s a nice kid. He’s never acted like this before. I rushed over, yanked his arm, and yelped. The robot zapped me. The pain was incredible. Every hair on my body stood on end.  



The robot-boy growled, “Do NOT touch me again.” His eyes were blinking non-stop.

  

“Pardon me?” I was furious. Before he could reply, I picked him up over my shoulder and carried him to the door, despite the dripping kid-crap. Everyone applauded, especially Amy, who was completely disheveled.   

  

“PUT ME DOWN!” The robot-boy hollered. “STUPID HUMAN!”  

  

The shocks came like rapid fire – ZAP, ZING, ZOING. Every nerve in my body was exploding, and I stank like raw sewage. My ego burst like a balloon. I was the Worst Father Ever, and everyone knew it. I couldn’t leave soon enough.  

  

The drive home felt like forever. Nick wouldn’t let up: he insulted me, his sister, the kids at school, the kids at daycare, and especially Amy, who had the audacity to scold him. 



I sent him to his room.   

  

BIG mistake.  

  

The robot costume short-circuited; its gizmos were going haywire. Steam was sifting through its silver-tinged helmet. It grunted. Then the power went out. Not just for our house, but the entire block.  

  

A coincidence, I told myself. A bone-chilling coincidence. I ignored the unruly robot-boy, and ordered pizza for dinner, which pleased Edith. I was worried about her. The last thing she needed was more stress in her life. 



The robot-boy kept mucking around, and complaining about everything. I was at my wit’s end. If only Abby were here, she’d know what to do. Memories of my wife flooded into my mind. I missed her dearly. We all did.   

  

I found our wedding pictures, and sat with Edith on the couch. We went through the entire photo album. “Mommy’s so beautiful,” she said in a wistful voice. I agreed.   

  

The robot-boy seemed to have calmed down. He still hadn’t gone to his bedroom, but I wasn’t going to push the issue. I’m a big fella. I don’t scare easily. But I was on edge. This was my boy. Except, it wasn’t.    

  

The costume.   

  

I had to dispose of it.  

 

But how?  

 

I’d wait until he was asleep, steal it from his closet, take it to the dumpster and burn the damned thing. That was my plan. I’d deal with the consequences when they came.   

  

It took over an hour (and several slices of pizza) to coax the kid out of the costume. When he changed into his PJs, he returned to normal. I sighed. Everything was good again. Seeing as though the power was still off, we played boardgames. Perhaps ‘Robots’ wasn’t a good choice, but the boy seemed satisfied.  

  

In the wee hours of the morning, I snuck into his bedroom; he’s a light sleeper, so I had to be super-quiet. Holding my breath, I crept carefully towards the closet. The closet creaked open. I groaned. The costume wasn’t in there. Where the heck was it? I spied the entire bedroom. 

  

I saw the robot, and nearly screamed.   

  

There it was, wrapped in warm blankets, tucked neatly beside the boy. 



I stood there, angered and frustrated, unsure of what to do.  

 

The boy opened his eyes; he shot me a nasty look.  

 

“Hey champ,” I said, lacklusterly. “Just checking in on ya.” I tussled his hair, then scampered out of the room before anything else could go wrong.

  

Later that night, I dreamed the robot-boy murdered the entire neighborhood. The nightmare repeated all night long, and I awoke covered in sweat-soaked bedsheets.  

  

I was up at the crack of dawn, preparing a special Halloween breakfast for the kids. (Thankfully, the power was back on.) Their school was closed for the day, and I didn’t dare bring them back to Amy’s, so I took the day off work. I had them all to myself.   

  

Edith was quiet all morning; she picked away at her ghoulish pancakes (normally her favorite), then asked to be excused. Nick was late getting up. At first, I was fine with this. Grateful, if I’m being honest. But by ten o’clock, I started to worry.



What if he sneaked out the window and started causing havoc? 



What if he’s in danger? 



I reminded myself that he’s nearly thirteen-years-old, and that growing boys need sleep. If he’s not up by noon, I’ll wake him.

  

By noon the house was graveyard-quiet, and the boy still hadn’t come down yet. Not a good sign. Tepidly, I tip-toed upstairs to check on him. The old oak floors moaned as I moved. I stood at his door for what felt like hours. Why was I so skittish? I must be losing it. 



I put my ear against his door, and listened.  

 

He was awake alright. 

  

I knocked.   

  

No answer.  

  

“Nick? You hungry?” I waited.  

  

My veins were ice cubes. Something must be wrong. The boy was always hungry. I opened the door and gasped. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Was I hallucinating? Sure seemed like it. 



I charged inside, fists clenched, ready to rumble.  

 

The robot was strangling Nick. The boy’s face was blue and puffy, his eyes as big as saucers. I needed to act quickly, so I grabbed the robot and threw him off the boy.  

  

The robot stood up on its own and snarled. It leapt onto my shoulders and started thrashing me. The thing was strong, I’ll give it that. And quick. I tripped over a discarded transformer and fell, smashing my head onto the dresser. I saw stars. Then, darkness.  

  

Pain.  

 

At some point, my eyes popped open. My head hurt like hell. I was disoriented. I must be dreaming. In the real world, robot costumes don’t come alive and take a family hostage. That’s something you read about in sci-fi fiction.   

  

WHACK.  

  

The monster smacked my face. It was standing over me; its soulless were eyes blinking non-stop.  

 

I assessed the situation: I was on the floor, bound to the bed with rope; beside me was the boy. He wasn’t moving.  I feared he was dead, but his steady snoring reassured me. My mouth was taped shut. I started kicking and thrashing, and soon grew tired. I was a captive of my own creation. A prisoner.



What I needed was a plan.   

  

Edith! She was our only hope. Where was she? In her room with earbuds jammed inside her head, that’s where.



The robot was making weird noises, and flapping its arms. It wanted something from me. I tried talking through the tape. It ripped the tape off my mouth. WOOSH. The pain was instantaneous.  



The robot got right in my face; it stank like grease. Inside its helmet, looking back at me, was the life-sized alien head my wife bought Nick last Christmas. The thing cost a fortune. The rest of the alien was stuffed inside the box. It's legs were short and stout and painted silver.



I shivered. Somehow, the alien and the robot merged. Great. Just what I needed: an alien-bot.

 

“Wor-wor-wor,” the alien-bot barked.   

  

“Let me go!” I shouted. I wanted to it to bits. I was livid. Furious.   



It blinked non-stop, and tapped its chest. It was trying to tell me something. 



“I don’t understand,” I said.



The alien-bot disappeared under the bed, and came out with an empty can of WD40. 

  

Aha! It needs a lube. Well, it ain’t getting any. 



It crushed the can, then chucked it at the boy, who was still unconscious on the bed.   



“If you hurt him,” I said, “I’ll kill you.” A ridiculous thing to say to a robot costume, but I meant it.   

  

“Wor-wor-wor,” it replied. Then it zoomed across the bedroom and scooted downstairs.    

  

Now’s my chance! I tried freeing myself, and failed. I wanted to sit upright, but couldn’t. I was seriously pissed off. And worried. What if the alien-bot harms my daughter?  

  

“Edith!” I shouted, hating the sound of my shaky voice. “Edith, come quick!”  

  

Nothing. How many times did my wife tell her not to use the earbuds full volume?   

  

“Edith! Help!”  

  

The bedroom door creaked open. I tried craning my neck around to look, but I was stuck facing the wrong direction. All I could see was a dresser and a window overlooking a birch tree.   

  

“Wor-wor-wor.”  

  

Stupid robot. If I’d known any of this would happen, I never would’ve constructed the damned thing. It jumped onto the bed and started nudging Nick. The boy mumbled under his breath.   

  

“Nick! You okay?” I asked.

  

“Daddy?”  

  

Phew. He’s okay.   

  

“Don’t do ANYTHING,” I said carefully. “Not yet.”  

  

“Wor-wor-wor,” went the alien-bot.  

  

Ugh. I hated that thing.  

  

It stood in front of me, and produced a pack of matches. In its other hand was an aerosol can of WD-40, which was extremely flammable. It shook the can, then pressed the nozzle: ZZZZRRRRRRR.   

  

It wants to set the house on fire.  

  

‘Daddy!” Nick cried. “Stop him!”  

  

“I can’t!” I bellowed. “I’m stuck!”   

  

WOOSH.   

  

The bed caught fire.



“Wor-wor-wor.” The robot raced to the door. 



There was a commotion. If only I could turn around and see what was happening.    

  

Someone spoke. “Hey! What’s going on in there?”  

  

“Edith!”   

  

More commotion.



“Hey! Stop that!” she complained. 

  

There was a skirmish, followed by a dreadful silence. I wanted to shout, but I was busy flopping like a fish, trying desperately to put out the fire.   

  

“Hey robot!” Edith shouted. “Chase this!”  

  

I stopped floundering and looked up. Flickered through the window was a tiny red dot. 



The laser pointer! 



Our black cat Shadow, who disappeared last summer, loved the thing. Edith must have grabbed it from the junk drawer.   

  

The robot raced across the bedroom and stopped in front of the window. It pawed the glowing red dot.



“Wor-wor-wor.” 



The red dot dashed across the window.



It scooped and swiped, but the dot kept moving. The alien-bot started shaking; smoke was billowing from its ears.  The alien-bot backed up, and with remarkable speed, it attacked the red dot and crashed through the window.  

  

“Holy hell!” I shouted.   

  

“Daddy!” Edith grabbed me. “What do I do?”  

  

“Get a bucket of water!” I replied. “Hurry!” 

  

She returned moments later, and put out the fire. I told her where the knives were. With much effort, she freed me. I swiped the X-Acto knife from her tiny hand and rescued the boy. We hugged for an eternity.  

 

I rushed outside.   

  

The robot was stuck in a tree, flailing.  

 

“Payback’s a bitch,” I said, fetching a shovel. I told the kids to keep a close eye on the robot while I dug a hole in the yard. “If anything happens, call me.” In the heat of the moment, I didn’t know what else to do. It took ten minutes or so to dig the hole. Afterwards, I found a pair of work gloves; then, using a ladder, I grabbed the cursed creature from the tree and stuffed it into a garbage bag.  



We all took turns jumping on top of it, but the damned thing wouldn’t die. It kept making those whirling sounds.  

  

“Get the axe!” I ordered Nick.  

 

He did. I let him take the first few swings, smashing the stupid robot to bits, while Edith cheered him on. I finished the job, and chopped it into a million pieces. Then I buried the mechanical monster in the yard.   

 

Flustered, I took the kids out for lunch. They were uncharacteristically quiet. It’s not every day a Halloween costume comes to life and tries to kill you. I spent the rest of the day trying my darndest to cheer them up. It’s their first Halloween without their dear mother, after all.  

  

We stopped at a local costume shop on the way home, and Nick picked out a Spiderman costume. Nice and safe. They had a blast trick-or-treating. I wished my wife was with us. Maybe she was. Perhaps she was looking down from Heaven. If so, she’s probably laughing at us. Humor was her greatest strength, after all.    

  

Sleep didn’t come that night. How could it? I kept expecting an alien-bot to kill my kids. Ridiculous, I know. But every hour, I checked up on them. Then I searched around the house. Just in case.  The following morning, I was dead tired. But at least the kids seemed okay. Children have a wonderful way of coping, don’t they?



Later that day, just before dinner, something caught my attention in the yard: a gathering of animals.   

  

“What the?”  

  

I looked out the window, and frowned. 



My heart halted. 



Oh good God. This can’t be happening. Not now.  



But it was.  

 

I ran into the yard, wielding my Glock 19. Blood was on my mind. The squirrels and buzzards scrammed. Somewhere, a dog barked. I marched to the edge of the yard. The hole was dug up. I peaked inside and groaned. It was empty. Like a man possessed, I scavenged the perimeters of the house, gun cocked and loaded.



""Where’s that carking collection of spare parts?""  

 

After several trips around the house, I stopped to wipe the sweat from my brow. My hands were trembling. I really was losing my mind. Robots don’t come to life. Nor do they return from the dead. The sun was sinking. A cool breeze swept across the yard. The feeling of being watched was impossible to ignore. It was out there somewhere, taunting me.



 “Wor-wor-wor.”

 it's not like I'm narcoleptic, it only happens at night, at the correct hours, eight willing or unwilling continuous hours of sleep. Recently i realized I had never tried not to go to sleep before, my mom didn't let me go to sleepovers or long trips without her. I used to be very tidy, very clean, I would go to bed all by myself at ten, even in college. Not anymore. 

I work for a Swedish furniture company, the prototype people send me the boxes and one of any versions of the instruction manual, I build them in my medium size apartment filled with other furniture. I'm their model customer. I take detailed notes of difficult or confusing moments, add any suggestions for fixing the issue and why it's important. It’s a meticulous and demanding job; every extra twist of the screwdriver is noticed and archived.  

It’s usually a piece a day, then I do the same with the disassembly, that usually takes half a day and I ship them back alongside the folder or binder with the analysis. I can usually do and undo three big units a week. But not always, not this time. The designers must've been a young group, sons of bosses toying with psychotropics and a Memphis group - new age revival. Grotesque colors, mismatching sides and even a bloody new packaging. They wanted me to “experience” the making of the bookshelf; they wanted me to “put my own creative input” and said something about “modular” nonsense.  

This diabolical shapeless mess cost me the day, I didn't even finish the bookshelf and next in line was a night table and a bureau, i could not take it. I had a drink for the first time since New Year's Eve and collapsed on my sofa, even the thought of dismantling that clownish thing was daunting. I left it as it was, got myself something to eat and left the dishes for tomorrow me to handle, I remember that, i never do that, i was tired and stressed and fuck fuck fuck fuckfuckkfjñnlgffdsl 

Those dishes, they were fucking clean and dry in the morning.

It was a weird experience, confusing mostly. I continued with my day but could not get it out of my mind. I knew, I know I didn't wash them, is there someone here?  

The bookshelf was somewhat finished I guessed, it didn't look like a finished thing but I had no more pieces left. The bureau was worse, way past my schedule and still hadn't finished most of it, now the screws and planks were everywhere. I used to be very tidy, very clean, everything in a bag or colored box. Now a mess of screws, hinges, doors and pommels in my carpet, in the “bookshelf”, in the balcony... I had another drink and left it all there, like Nero left Rome after the fire. 

In the morning, as if no work was ever done, the bureau was boxed, not a splinter, not a nail nor nothing where I left it; it was all in the now sealed shipment box.  

I stood looking at my livingroom for what felt like hours, trying to explain, trying to have the strength to set foot in the living or the kitchen. I was sure there was someone here and was messing with me, I kept looking at corners and shadows, trying to catch something. I was going to catch the intruder, so I set a trap, I left both dirty dishes in the sink and the condemned bureau scattered in the room, I drank some coffee and waited behind a plant, my phone recording behind a vase.

Again, as if no work was ever done, the bureau was boxed, the dishes clean, my phone charging beside me and I in my bed in pajamas. No video from yesterday. I was livid.

Two red bulls and a spy-cam I bought with same day delivery, dirty kitchen, dirty living room, i also took a shit and didn't flush. Last time i checked the time it was 23:07, i fell asleep and again, everything clean, the spy-cam in a box with the return sticker printed and ready to be refunded in the app. I was not livid anymore, i was terrified and my toilet was shitless.

1ok5gc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1ok5gc5/best_vpns_for_singapore/,Best VPNs for Singapore,"Singapore presents a unique digital paradox. While boasting some of the world's fastest internet speeds and exceptional connectivity infrastructure, the city-state has simultaneously tightened its grip on online freedom. In 2024, Singapore experienced a **49% surge in phishing attacks** and a **21% increase in ransomware incidents**, according to the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore's latest report. Add to this the government's expanding censorship powers through the Foreign Interference Countermeasures Act (FICA) and the Online Criminal Harms Act (OCHA), and you have a compelling case for why Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have become essential tools for residents, expats, and travelers in Singapore.

But here's the critical question: **Are VPNs even legal in Singapore?** And if so, which ones actually work reliably in 2025? This comprehensive guide cuts through the noise to provide you with authoritative, security-focused recommendations backed by rigorous testing and current threat intelligence.

# Why You Need a VPN in Singapore

# Government Surveillance and the FICA Law

Singapore ranks **160th out of 180 countries** in the World Press Freedom Index, a sobering statistic for a technologically advanced nation. The Foreign Interference Countermeasures Act, passed in October 2021, grants the government broad powers to censor online content, block websites, restrict social media accounts, and compel Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block specific content.

Under Singapore's legal framework, ISPs are required to comply with government requests for user data. The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) levies fines of up to **10% of annual turnover or SGD $1 million** for data breaches, creating a complex environment where your online activities could be monitored more extensively than you realize.

**A quality VPN encrypts your internet traffic**, making it virtually impossible for ISPs, government agencies, or malicious actors to monitor your online activities. This encryption creates a secure tunnel between your device and the VPN server, protecting your digital privacy.

# Website Blocking and Censorship

The Media Development Authority (MDA) maintains a blocklist of over **100 websites** deemed offensive or harmful to Singapore's interests. Recent enforcement actions have intensified:

* **February 2025**: 22 additional illegal streaming sites and 70 related domains were blocked by court order
* **May 2018**: 53 torrent and streaming websites, including The Pirate Bay and KickassTorrents, were blocked
* **Ongoing restrictions**: Dating sites like Ashley Madison, pornographic content platforms, and politically sensitive materials remain inaccessible

While some of these restrictions target genuinely harmful content, legitimate research materials, news sources, and international services may also become collateral damage. A VPN allows you to access blocked websites by routing your connection through servers in unrestricted locations.

# Public WiFi Security Risks

Singapore is one of the world's leaders in public WiFi accessibility, with hotspots available in airports, shopping malls, coffee shops, hotels, and public transit. However, this convenience comes with significant security risks:

**Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Cybercriminals can intercept data transmitted over unsecured public networks, potentially stealing login credentials, financial information, and personal data.

**Evil Twin Networks**: Hackers create fake WiFi hotspots with names similar to legitimate networks (e.g., ""Changi Airport Free WiFi"" vs. ""Changi-Airport-FreeWiFi""). Once connected, all your internet traffic passes through the attacker's device.

**Packet Sniffing**: Sophisticated attackers use specialized tools to capture and analyze unencrypted data packets, extracting sensitive information from unsuspecting users.

According to recent cybersecurity research, **44% of Singaporeans admit to interacting with phishing messages in the past year**, despite high awareness of cyber threats. When combined with vulnerable public WiFi, this creates a perfect storm for data compromise.

**A VPN shields you from these threats** by encrypting all data transmitted over public networks, rendering it useless to anyone attempting to intercept it.

# Accessing Global and Local Content

For **Singaporean expats abroad**, accessing local streaming services like Singtel TV, meWATCH, Channel NewsAsia, Viu, and HOOQ becomes impossible due to geo-restrictions. These platforms verify your location through your IP address and block access from outside Singapore.

Conversely, **foreign residents in Singapore** often find themselves unable to access content from their home countries, including BBC iPlayer, Hulu, Paramount+, and region-specific Netflix libraries.

A VPN solves both problems by allowing you to connect to servers in your desired location, obtaining a local IP address that unlocks geo-restricted content.

# Is Using a VPN Legal in Singapore?

**Yes, VPNs are completely legal in Singapore.** There are no laws prohibiting the use of VPN services for individuals or businesses. In fact, VPNs are widely used by corporations for secure remote access and by individuals for legitimate privacy protection.

However, **using a VPN does not grant immunity from Singapore's laws**. The following activities remain illegal regardless of VPN usage:

* **Accessing pirated content**: Singapore's Copyright Act prohibits accessing copyrighted material without authorization. ISPs have sent cease-and-desist letters to file-sharers, and courts have blocked numerous piracy websites.
* **Engaging in cybercrime**: The Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act criminalizes unauthorized access to computer systems, distribution of malware, and other cyber offenses.
* **Distributing illegal content**: Spreading false information, hate speech, or content that disrupts racial and religious harmony remains prohibited.

**The bottom line**: Use your VPN responsibly for legitimate purposes like privacy protection, secure browsing, and accessing content you're legally entitled to view. A VPN is a privacy tool, not a license to break the law.

# Best VPNs for Singapore in 2025

After extensive testing of connection speeds, security features, server reliability, and customer support, these three VPN providers emerged as the top choices for Singapore users in 2025.

# 1. NordVPN - Best Overall VPN for Singapore

**Why NordVPN Tops Our List**: With approximately **100 servers strategically located throughout Singapore** and a global network exceeding 7,000 servers across 118+ countries, NordVPN delivers the perfect combination of local connectivity and international reach.

**Performance Highlights**:

* **Speed Retention**: 90% of base connection speed maintained through the proprietary NordLynx protocol (based on WireGuard)
* **RAM-Only Servers**: All servers run entirely on volatile memory, ensuring no data is ever written to physical drives
* **Obfuscated Servers**: Make VPN traffic appear as regular HTTPS traffic, useful if network administrators attempt to detect VPN usage
* **Threat Protection Pro**: Blocks ads, trackers, and malware in real-time

**Security Features**:

* **AES-256 encryption** with perfect forward secrecy
* **Independently audited no-logs policy** verified by PricewaterhouseCoopers
* **Automatic kill switch** prevents data leaks if VPN connection drops
* **DNS leak protection** ensures all queries route through encrypted VPN tunnel
* **Double VPN** routes traffic through two servers for enhanced anonymity

**Streaming Performance**: NordVPN consistently unblocks Netflix (US, Singapore, and 10+ other regions), Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, and Singapore-specific services like Singtel TV GO, Toggle, and Channel NewsAsia. Videos load in under 10 seconds with zero buffering in HD quality.

**Pricing**: Starting at **$3.69/month** for the 2-year plan with a 30-day money-back guarantee. Includes protection for up to 10 devices simultaneously.

**Best For**: Privacy-conscious users, heavy streamers, and anyone seeking the most comprehensive security features.

# 2. Surfshark - Best Budget VPN for Singapore

**Why Surfshark Stands Out**: While offering competitive pricing, Surfshark refuses to compromise on features. The provider's **unlimited simultaneous connections** policy means you can protect every device in your household with a single subscription.

**Performance Highlights**:

* **Speed Tests**: Achieved over **800 Mbps** on US servers during testing, outpacing both ExpressVPN and NordVPN
* **3,200+ Servers**: Distributed across 100+ countries, including multiple Singapore locations
* **CleanWeb Ad-Blocker**: Blocks intrusive advertisements and tracking cookies
* **Camouflage Mode**: Makes VPN traffic indistinguishable from regular internet activity

**Security Features**:

* **AES-256-GCM encryption** for maximum security
* **MultiHop**: Routes connection through two VPN servers simultaneously
* **Rotating IP**: Changes IP address periodically without disconnecting
* **GPS spoofing** on Android for location-based app privacy
* **Independently audited** by Cure53 (Germany) and Deloitte

**Value Proposition**: At just **$2.19/month** for the 2-year plan, Surfshark offers premium features at budget-friendly prices. The unlimited connections policy provides exceptional value for families or individuals with multiple devices.

**Best For**: Budget-conscious users, large households, and those who prioritize value without sacrificing security.

# 3. ExpressVPN - Best for Speed and Reliability

**Why ExpressVPN Commands Premium Pricing**: ExpressVPN operates servers in **three distinct Singapore locations** (Central Business District, Marina Bay, and Jurong), providing localized options for optimal performance. The provider's proprietary Lightway protocol delivers blazing speeds while maintaining military-grade security.

**Performance Highlights**:

* **Consistent 25+ Mbps speeds** even on distant servers
* **Lightway Protocol**: Custom-built for speed optimization without security compromises
* **MediaStreamer**: Smart DNS service enables VPN functionality on devices that don't natively support VPNs (smart TVs, gaming consoles)
* **Network Lock**: ExpressVPN's kill switch implementation is among the industry's most reliable

**Security Features**:

* **TrustedServer Technology**: All servers run on RAM-only, with no data written to hard drives
* **Perfect forward secrecy**: Generates a unique encryption key for each session
* **Audited by PwC**: Independent verification of no-logs policy
* **Headquartered in British Virgin Islands**: Outside Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, and Fourteen Eyes surveillance alliances

**Streaming Excellence**: ExpressVPN's reputation for reliably unblocking streaming platforms is well-earned. It works seamlessly with Netflix (multiple regions), Hulu, Disney+, HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video, and Singapore-specific services.

**Pricing**: Starting at **$6.67/month** with the 12-month plan plus 3 free months, backed by a 30-day money-back guarantee. Supports up to 8 simultaneous connections.

**Best For**: Users who prioritize maximum speed, consistent reliability, and premium customer support.

# Key Features to Look for in a Singapore VPN

When evaluating VPN providers for use in Singapore, prioritize these essential features:

**Singapore Server Presence**: Local servers provide the fastest speeds for browsing Singapore-based content and allow expats abroad to access Singaporean streaming services.

**Obfuscation Technology**: Disguises VPN traffic as regular HTTPS traffic, making it difficult for network administrators to detect VPN usage. While Singapore doesn't actively block VPNs, this feature adds an extra layer of privacy.

**Kill Switch Protection**: Automatically disconnects your internet if the VPN connection drops, preventing accidental data exposure.

**No-Logs Policy**: Ensures the VPN provider doesn't store records of your online activities. Look for providers with independently audited policies.

**Strong Encryption**: AES-256 encryption is the industry standard, used by governments and militaries worldwide.

**Speed Optimization**: Given Singapore's world-class internet infrastructure, your VPN shouldn't significantly throttle your connection. Look for providers with minimal speed loss (under 20%).

**Multi-Device Support**: Protect all your devices—smartphones, tablets, laptops, and smart TVs—with a single subscription.

# Common Use Cases for VPNs in Singapore

# Protecting Privacy on Public WiFi

Whether you're working from a café in Clarke Quay, waiting at Changi Airport, or shopping at Marina Bay Sands, public WiFi networks present significant security risks. **Always activate your VPN before connecting to public networks** to encrypt your data and protect against MITM attacks, packet sniffing, and malicious hotspots.

# Accessing Blocked Websites

While respecting Singapore's laws, VPNs provide access to legitimate blocked content, including international news sources, research materials, and services that may be incorrectly categorized. Remember: accessing pirated content remains illegal regardless of VPN usage.

# Streaming Global Content

Foreign residents can maintain access to their home country's streaming services (BBC iPlayer, Hulu, Paramount+, regional Netflix libraries) by connecting to VPN servers in those locations. This is particularly valuable for expats who want to keep up with news and entertainment from home.

# Watching Singaporean TV While Abroad

Singaporean citizens traveling internationally can access local streaming platforms—Singtel TV, meWATCH, Toggle, Channel NewsAsia, Viu—by connecting to Singapore VPN servers. This ensures you never miss your favorite local shows while on business trips or vacation.

# Protecting Yourself Beyond VPNs

While a VPN is essential for privacy in Singapore's digital landscape, combine it with these additional security practices:

* **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Despite 78% of Singaporeans claiming to use MFA, proper implementation matters. Use authentication apps rather than SMS-based codes when possible.
* **Use Password Managers**: Generate and store unique, complex passwords for each account.
* **Keep Software Updated**: Apply security patches promptly to protect against known vulnerabilities.
* **Be Skeptical of Phishing**: Given that 44% of Singaporeans interact with phishing messages, maintain heightened vigilance with unexpected emails and links.
* **Verify Network Authenticity**: Before connecting to public WiFi, confirm the network name with staff to avoid evil twin attacks.

# Conclusion: Your Path to Digital Privacy in Singapore

Singapore's sophisticated digital infrastructure and world-class connectivity are undeniable assets. However, increasing government surveillance capabilities, expanding censorship powers, and rising cyber threats create a challenging environment for online privacy. **VPNs remain legal, essential tools** for protecting your digital life in 2025.

**For most users, NordVPN** offers the best combination of speed, security, and features, with 100+ local servers and comprehensive privacy protections. **Budget-conscious users** will find exceptional value in Surfshark's unlimited connections and competitive pricing. **Those prioritizing maximum speed and reliability** should consider ExpressVPN despite its premium pricing.

Remember: a VPN is a privacy tool, not a license to engage in illegal activities. Use it responsibly to protect your personal data, secure your connections on public networks, and maintain access to content you're legally entitled to view.

**Take action today**: Choose a provider that meets your needs, activate the 30-day money-back guarantee, and experience the difference that proper digital privacy protection makes. In Singapore's evolving cyber landscape, a quality VPN isn't just recommended—it's essential.

1ok5fc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/loanoriginators/comments/1ok5fc3/what_being_an_lo_for_15_years_can_teach_you/,What being an LO for 15 years can teach you,"Not sure if anyone else’s been feeling this, but the last few years have been something in this business.

Been in mortgages for about 15 years now, give or take.

I wouldn’t say things were easier back then, but they were definitely different. People showed up with folders, documents ready, you’d shake hands, have a proper chat. Now it’s all text messages and clients asking for the lowest rate before they even tell you what their credit looks like.

I started around the end of 2009. Worked under a small brokerage in my home country. We weren’t the biggest, but we were probably one of the only ones doing things properly.

The owner passed away a few years in, heart attack, and we all kind of drifted off after that. I moved to the States later and joined a bigger firm for a bit, but I never liked being told how to handle clients, so I left after about a year.

In the early days, there wasn’t much tech to lean on. No real automation or “funnels” or whatever people are doing now. You’d just meet people, go to events, get introduced through someone. I used to print flyers for a free mortgage info night, literally just 50 or 100 pieces at a time and hand them out at community events or local shows.

Would rent a small room at a restaurant, pay maybe a grand or two for dinner, and invite anyone curious to come listen. It wasn’t fancy. Maybe 30–40 people would show up, and we’d just talk about refinancing, how to cut payments, that sort of thing. That’s how I built most of my early clients. No ads, no tracking, no online anything.

What worked wasn’t the presentation. It was just talking to people like normal humans. Learning the neighborhoods, knowing what houses go for, what people were worried about. That’s it. You talk like that, and they remember you.

Later on, I started running Facebook and YouTube ads. I show testimonials and explainers about how people save $1000–3000 a month through refinancing. It works well now, but it only works because of the way I used to talk to people back then and the “experiene” I had. 

The tone carried over basically, showing people you’ve done the job and really now what you’re doing is all you need, but wouldn’t recommend it for starters.

You don’t need an office either. I’ve had plenty of good talks with clients over coffee. Sometimes I’d joke, “I help people get into homes like these,” and they’d ask if I was serious, and I’d tell them I could get them approved for something similar. Little comments like that go a long way.

I guess what I’m saying is, a lot of people in this industry overcomplicate things. The tools  might have changed a bit but it’s still the same game.

If you can actually hold a real conversation and show you care, you’ll do fine.

Anywho, just figured I’d share a bit from experience.

Wether your drinking on the job, sneaking out to the dumpsters, railing Adderall off the domino's cutting table, smoking meth in the bathroom. Just know

#You are not alone.

This industry is ripe for abuse of all kind, physical, sexual, personal, drugs, etc...

#You are not alone

Creepy km keeps brushing against you? That friendly cook always wants a hug? Boss keeps standing in your way to leave the cooler. Coworker keeps grabbing you? Customers nagging sexual harassment management won't take care of?

#You are not alone

You can't sleep so you take an extra sleeping pill? Your anxiety is so high, you double the Xanax? Can't wind down, you pour yourself drinks until you pass out?

#You are not alone

Feel you cannot make it? Depression has you at your lowest? Life feeling like it's strangulation you?

#You are not alone

The abuse we take daily, takes its toll. Mentally and physically. Your restaurant will survive without you.

Make sure you are taking time for yourself. You matter, this job is just another job. 

I would rather see you all happy and healthy. Than what I see is the default in the industry.

You may be too proud to ask for help, or you may not know how. 

Just know there are people that will listen to you. 

Don't make rash decisions over a temporary situation. 

#Let's actually be the change.

Domestic abuse hotline: 800-799-7233
Human trafficking hotline: 888-373-7888

If you feel it's time, it's not. Please call 911. Help is out there.

Again I'd rather see you all alive and healthy, instead of what the industry standard is.

Obligatory:  make sure you all are eating right and getting enough water each day. 

WATER, not coffee or water containing products.

 it's not like I'm narcoleptic, it only happens at night, at the correct hours, eight willing or unwilling continuous hours of sleep. Recently i realized I had never tried not to go to sleep before, my mom didn't let me go to sleepovers or long trips without her. I used to be very tidy, very clean, I would go to bed all by myself at ten, even in college. Not anymore. 

I work for a Swedish furniture company, the prototype people send me the boxes and one of any versions of the instruction manual, I build them in my medium size apartment filled with other furniture. I'm their model customer. I take detailed notes of difficult or confusing moments, add any suggestions for fixing the issue and why it's important. It’s a meticulous and demanding job; every extra twist of the screwdriver is noticed and archived.  

It’s usually a piece a day, then I do the same with the disassembly, that usually takes half a day and I ship them back alongside the folder or binder with the analysis. I can usually do and undo three big units a week. But not always, not this time. The designers must've been a young group, sons of bosses toying with psychotropics and a Memphis group - new age revival. Grotesque colors, mismatching sides and even a bloody new packaging. They wanted me to “experience” the making of the bookshelf; they wanted me to “put my own creative input” and said something about “modular” nonsense.  

This diabolical shapeless mess cost me the day, I didn't even finish the bookshelf and next in line was a night table and a bureau, i could not take it. I had a drink for the first time since New Year's Eve and collapsed on my sofa, even the thought of dismantling that clownish thing was daunting. I left it as it was, got myself something to eat and left the dishes for tomorrow me to handle, I remember that, i never do that, i was tired and stressed and fuck fuck fuck fuckfuckkfjñnlgffdsl 

Those dishes, they were fucking clean and dry in the morning.

It was a weird experience, confusing mostly. I continued with my day but could not get it out of my mind. I knew, I know I didn't wash them, is there someone here?  

The bookshelf was somewhat finished I guessed, it didn't look like a finished thing but I had no more pieces left. The bureau was worse, way past my schedule and still hadn't finished most of it, now the screws and planks were everywhere. I used to be very tidy, very clean, everything in a bag or colored box. Now a mess of screws, hinges, doors and pommels in my carpet, in the “bookshelf”, in the balcony... I had another drink and left it all there, like Nero left Rome after the fire. 

In the morning, as if no work was ever done, the bureau was boxed, not a splinter, not a nail nor nothing where I left it; it was all in the now sealed shipment box.  

I stood looking at my livingroom for what felt like hours, trying to explain, trying to have the strength to set foot in the living or the kitchen. I was sure there was someone here and was messing with me, I kept looking at corners and shadows, trying to catch something. I was going to catch the intruder, so I set a trap, I left both dirty dishes in the sink and the condemned bureau scattered in the room, I drank some coffee and waited behind a plant, my phone recording behind a vase.

Again, as if no work was ever done, the bureau was boxed, the dishes clean, my phone charging beside me and I in my bed in pajamas. No video from yesterday. I was livid.

Two red bulls and a spy-cam I bought with same day delivery, dirty kitchen, dirty living room, i also took a shit and didn't flush. Last time i checked the time it was 23:07, i fell asleep and again, everything clean, the spy-cam in a box with the return sticker printed and ready to be refunded in the app. I was not livid anymore, i was terrified and my toilet was shitless.

1ok5a90,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ok5a90/my_kids_halloween_costume_is_alive/,My Kid's Halloween Costume is Alive,"I made Halloween costumes for my kids. In the past, this was something my wife and I did together. It was a tradition. Sadly, my wife passed away recently, so this year’s Halloween felt heavy. I wanted to make it extra special for the kids – an exercise in futility, I know – but you can’t blame a dad for trying.   

  

My kids are eight and twelve: Nick, the oldest, is my son, and Edith is my eight-year-old daughter. Great kids. After watching Wizard of Oz for the umpteenth time, Edith decided to dress up as Glinda the Good. With the aid of many Youtube tutorials, I stitched up a sparkling witch’s costume. It looked splendid.

 

Then there was Nick’s costume.   

  

Nick was adamant: he wanted to be a robot for Halloween. He loves robots. Always has. Seemed harmless enough.


Little did I know.


For starters, we needed a large box for the body. Fortunately, I’d recently purchased a new dishwasher, so I used the box it came with. Fit like a dream. I found a smaller box for the robot’s head. Many other objects were required: flexible ducts, a Slinky, glass bottles and caps, spray can lids, and a plethora of throw-away computer parts. Plenty of tinfoil and silver spray paint were also used.

  

The kid's costume looked fantastic. Nick was ecstatic. His big blue eyes blew up like balloons. I’d truly outdone myself. 

  

The day before Halloween, their school had a costume party. Edith, who’s both stubborn and shy, refused to dress up. I wasn’t surprised; she’d been acting out lately, ever since her mother died. Nick, on the other hand, couldn’t contain his excitement. 


When he came down for breakfast that morning, I nearly died. His costume seemed so realistic; it fit him like a dream. The lights attached to his chest were blinking, and the gauges were moving. (Did I attach a battery?) His face was painted to precision. You’d be hard pressed to recognize him. He even walked like a robot: CLINK, CLUNK, CLANK.


It was seven o’clock in the morning; I was astounded. I watched, transfixed, as he ambled towards the fridge, found the milk jug, and poured himself a tall glass. He gulped it down, then sat awkwardly at the table.  

 

“Breakfast!” he demanded, sounding more machine than human.  

  

I spit out my coffee, soaking my crotch; the coffee was scorching, so I charged into the washroom and cleaned up. I didn’t trust the sound of the boy’s voice. It sounded cruel and inhumane. And it was two octaves lower. 


Just my imagination, I told myself. 

  

I gathered my nerves and returned to the kitchen. To my surprise, the boy fixed himself some cereal and toast. Not a big feat, of course, except he never does that. Ever. Despite my constant nagging. Maybe he’s learning, I reminded myself. I was the same way at his age.  

  

He devoured his breakfast, and belched. It stank like a rusted old train. He released a laugh so diabolical, it made my skin crawl. He belched again, then marched towards the fridge and came out with a full bottle of Coke. He emptied the entire bottle of pop down his throat. The belch that followed could be heard by the neighbors.   

  

I was gobsmacked. Why was he acting this way? Many thoughts crashed through my mind:   

  

Maybe the costume was giving him confidence?   

  

Maybe something happened at school – something I don’t know about – and he’s deflecting?  


Maybe the costume was cursed.


I was overreacting. He’s still a kid, and he’s acting strangely. No biggie. Heck, he’s still reeling from the loss of his mother. It would be weird for him not to be acting out. I told myself this, but I didn’t believe it.  

  

Edith came moping into the kitchen.   

  

“What’s up, sweetie?” I asked, trying to sound cheerful.   

  

She shrugged.   

  

“Hungry?” I asked.  

  

She plopped onto the kitchen chair, her red hair spilling across her freckled face. She looked at me and sniffled.  Meanwhile, the rickety robot was ravaging everything in the refrigerator. Nick started teasing her, and calling her names.  

  

“Nick!” I snapped. “Watch your mouth!”

  

The robot stood upright, “Or what?”  

  

He was so tall, it was shocking. The boy was due for a growth spurt, but this was ridiculous. I bit my tongue. 


Edith looked terrified. “Daddy,” she sobbed, “make him stop.”  

  

Despite my trepidation, I fake-laughed, hoping to lighten the mood, then I gathered their belongings and shooed them off to school. 

  

Work was hectic. I spent all day doing maintenance – which in itself is a nightmare – so I was busy, busy, busy. That afternoon, I received a platoon of texts from Amy, who runs their daycare. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it), I was too busy to check my phone, so I didn’t read them until I was parked in her driveway. And by then, it was too late.

 

When I entered the daycare, I smelled feces. No wonder. It was spread across the living room walls, like chunky brown paint. I  gagged.

 

Amy was red-faced and furious. “DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BOY!”


The boy was chasing kids around the house, throwing poop at them. The kids seemed terrified. 

 

Edith rushed over and hugged me; her face was withered from bawling.   

  

“Daddy,” she sniffled, “Nick is being bad.”   


Nick – still in his robot costume – had some poor kid in a full-nelson (a wrestling move he’d recently learned). He picked the kid up over his head and started spinning him. The poor kid was wailing. 


“Nick!” I shouted. “Knock it off!”  


I couldn’t believe my eyes. Normally, Nick’s a nice kid. He’s never acted like this before. I rushed over, yanked his arm, and yelped. The robot zapped me. The pain was incredible. Every hair on my body stood on end.  


The robot-boy growled, “Do NOT touch me again.” His eyes were blinking non-stop.

  

“Pardon me?” I was furious. Before he could reply, I picked him up over my shoulder and carried him to the door, despite the dripping kid-crap. Everyone applauded, especially Amy, who was completely disheveled.   

  

“PUT ME DOWN!” The robot-boy hollered. “STUPID HUMAN!”  

  

The shocks came like rapid fire – ZAP, ZING, ZOING. Every nerve in my body was exploding, and I stank like raw sewage. My ego burst like a balloon. I was the Worst Father Ever, and everyone knew it. I couldn’t leave soon enough.  

  

The drive home felt like forever. Nick wouldn’t let up: he insulted me, his sister, the kids at school, the kids at daycare, and especially Amy, who had the audacity to scold him. 


I sent him to his room.   

  

BIG mistake.  

  

The robot costume short-circuited; its gizmos were going haywire. Steam was sifting through its silver-tinged helmet. It grunted. Then the power went out. Not just for our house, but the entire block.  

  

A coincidence, I told myself. A bone-chilling coincidence. I ignored the unruly robot-boy, and ordered pizza for dinner, which pleased Edith. I was worried about her. The last thing she needed was more stress in her life. 


The robot-boy kept mucking around, and complaining about everything. I was at my wit’s end. If only Abby were here, she’d know what to do. Memories of my wife flooded into my mind. I missed her dearly. We all did.   

  

I found our wedding pictures, and sat with Edith on the couch. We went through the entire photo album. “Mommy’s so beautiful,” she said in a wistful voice. I agreed.   

  

The robot-boy seemed to have calmed down. He still hadn’t gone to his bedroom, but I wasn’t going to push the issue. I’m a big fella. I don’t scare easily. But I was on edge. This was my boy. Except, it wasn’t.    

  

The costume.   

  

I had to dispose of it.  

 

But how?  

 

I’d wait until he was asleep, steal it from his closet, take it to the dumpster and burn the damned thing. That was my plan. I’d deal with the consequences when they came.   

  

It took over an hour (and several slices of pizza) to coax the kid out of the costume. When he changed into his PJs, he returned to normal. I sighed. Everything was good again. Seeing as though the power was still off, we played boardgames. Perhaps ‘Robots’ wasn’t a good choice, but the boy seemed satisfied.  

  

In the wee hours of the morning, I snuck into his bedroom; he’s a light sleeper, so I had to be super-quiet. Holding my breath, I crept carefully towards the closet. The closet creaked open. I groaned. The costume wasn’t in there. Where the heck was it? I spied the entire bedroom. 

  

I saw the robot, and nearly screamed.   

  

There it was, wrapped in warm blankets, tucked neatly beside the boy. 


I stood there, angered and frustrated, unsure of what to do.  

 

The boy opened his eyes; he shot me a nasty look.  

 

“Hey champ,” I said, lacklusterly. “Just checking in on ya.” I tussled his hair, then scampered out of the room before anything else could go wrong.

  

Later that night, I dreamed the robot-boy murdered the entire neighborhood. The nightmare repeated all night long, and I awoke covered in sweat-soaked bedsheets.  

  

I was up at the crack of dawn, preparing a special Halloween breakfast for the kids. (Thankfully, the power was back on.) Their school was closed for the day, and I didn’t dare bring them back to Amy’s, so I took the day off work. I had them all to myself.   

  

Edith was quiet all morning; she picked away at her ghoulish pancakes (normally her favorite), then asked to be excused. Nick was late getting up. At first, I was fine with this. Grateful, if I’m being honest. But by ten o’clock, I started to worry.


What if he sneaked out the window and started causing havoc? 


What if he’s in danger? 


I reminded myself that he’s nearly thirteen-years-old, and that growing boys need sleep. If he’s not up by noon, I’ll wake him.

  

By noon the house was graveyard-quiet, and the boy still hadn’t come down yet. Not a good sign. Tepidly, I tip-toed upstairs to check on him. The old oak floors moaned as I moved. I stood at his door for what felt like hours. Why was I so skittish? I must be losing it. 


I put my ear against his door, and listened.  

 

He was awake alright. 

  

I knocked.   

  

No answer.  

  

“Nick? You hungry?” I waited.  

  

My veins were ice cubes. Something must be wrong. The boy was always hungry. I opened the door and gasped. I couldn’t believe my eyes. Was I hallucinating? Sure seemed like it. 


I charged inside, fists clenched, ready to rumble.  

 

The robot was strangling Nick. The boy’s face was blue and puffy, his eyes as big as saucers. I needed to act quickly, so I grabbed the robot and threw him off the boy.  

  

The robot stood up on its own and snarled. It leapt onto my shoulders and started thrashing me. The thing was strong, I’ll give it that. And quick. I tripped over a discarded transformer and fell, smashing my head onto the dresser. I saw stars. Then, darkness.  

  

Pain.  

 

At some point, my eyes popped open. My head hurt like hell. I was disoriented. I must be dreaming. In the real world, robot costumes don’t come alive and take a family hostage. That’s something you read about in sci-fi fiction.   

  

WHACK.  

  

The monster smacked my face. It was standing over me; its soulless were eyes blinking non-stop.  

 

I assessed the situation: I was on the floor, bound to the bed with rope; beside me was the boy. He wasn’t moving.  I feared he was dead, but his steady snoring reassured me. My mouth was taped shut. I started kicking and thrashing, and soon grew tired. I was a captive of my own creation. A prisoner.


What I needed was a plan.   

  

Edith! She was our only hope. Where was she? In her room with earbuds jammed inside her head, that’s where.


The robot was making weird noises, and flapping its arms. It wanted something from me. I tried talking through the tape. It ripped the tape off my mouth. WOOSH. The pain was instantaneous.  


The robot got right in my face; it stank like grease. Inside its helmet, looking back at me, was the life-sized alien head my wife bought Nick last Christmas. The thing cost a fortune. The rest of the alien was stuffed inside the box. Its legs were short and stout and painted silver.


I shivered. Somehow, the alien and the robot merged. Great. Just what I needed: an alien-bot.

 

“Wor-wor-wor,” the alien-bot barked.   

  

“Let me go!” I shouted. I wanted to it to bits. I was livid. Furious.   


It blinked non-stop, and tapped its chest. It was trying to tell me something. 


“I don’t understand,” I said.


The alien-bot disappeared under the bed, and came out with an empty can of WD40. 

  

Aha! It needs a lube. Well, it ain’t getting any. 


It crushed the can, then chucked it at the boy, who was still unconscious on the bed.   


“If you hurt him,” I said, “I’ll kill you.” A ridiculous thing to say to a robot costume, but I meant it.   

  

“Wor-wor-wor,” it replied. Then it zoomed across the bedroom and scooted downstairs.    

  

Now’s my chance! I tried freeing myself, and failed. I wanted to sit upright, but couldn’t. I was seriously pissed off. And worried. What if the alien-bot harms my daughter?  

  

“Edith!” I shouted, hating the sound of my shaky voice. “Edith, come quick!”  

  

Nothing. How many times did my wife tell her not to use the earbuds full volume?   

  

“Edith! Help!”  

  

The bedroom door creaked open. I tried craning my neck around to look, but I was stuck facing the wrong direction. All I could see was a dresser and a window overlooking a birch tree.   

  

“Wor-wor-wor.”  

  

Stupid robot. If I’d known any of this would happen, I never would’ve constructed the damned thing. It jumped onto the bed and started nudging Nick. The boy mumbled under his breath.   

  

“Nick! You okay?” I asked.

  

“Daddy?”  

  

Phew. He’s okay.   

  

“Don’t do ANYTHING,” I said carefully. “Not yet.”  

  

“Wor-wor-wor,” went the alien-bot.  

  

Ugh. I hated that thing.  

  

It stood in front of me, and produced a pack of matches. In its other hand was an aerosol can of WD-40, which was extremely flammable. It shook the can, then pressed the nozzle: ZZZZRRRRRRR.   

  

It wants to set the house on fire.  

  

‘Daddy!” Nick cried. “Stop him!”  

  

“I can’t!” I bellowed. “I’m stuck!”   

  

WOOSH.   

  

The bed caught fire.


“Wor-wor-wor.” The robot raced to the door. 


There was a commotion. If only I could turn around and see what was happening.    

  

Someone spoke. “Hey! What’s going on in there?”  

  

“Edith!”   

  

More commotion.


“Hey! Stop that!” she complained. 

  

There was a skirmish, followed by a dreadful silence. I wanted to shout, but I was busy flopping like a fish, trying desperately to put out the fire.   

  

“Hey robot!” Edith shouted. “Chase this!”  

  

I stopped floundering and looked up. Flickered through the window was a tiny red dot. 


The laser pointer! 


Our black cat Shadow, who disappeared last summer, loved the thing. Edith must have grabbed it from the junk drawer.   

  

The robot raced across the bedroom and stopped in front of the window. It pawed the glowing red dot.


“Wor-wor-wor.” 


The red dot dashed across the window.


It scooped and swiped, but the dot kept moving. The alien-bot started shaking; smoke was billowing from its ears.  The alien-bot backed up, and with remarkable speed, it attacked the red dot and crashed through the window.  

  

“Holy hell!” I shouted.   

  

“Daddy!” Edith grabbed me. “What do I do?”  

  

“Get a bucket of water!” I replied. “Hurry!” 

  

She returned moments later, and put out the fire. I told her where the knives were. With much effort, she freed me. I swiped the X-Acto knife from her tiny hand and rescued the boy. We hugged for an eternity.  

 

I rushed outside.   

  

The robot was stuck in a tree, flailing.  

 

“Payback’s a bitch,” I said, fetching a shovel. I told the kids to keep a close eye on the robot while I dug a hole in the yard. “If anything happens, call me.” In the heat of the moment, I didn’t know what else to do. It took ten minutes or so to dig the hole. Afterwards, I found a pair of work gloves; then, using a ladder, I grabbed the cursed creature from the tree and stuffed it into a garbage bag.  


We all took turns jumping on top of it, but the damned thing wouldn’t die. It kept making those whirling sounds.  

  

“Get the axe!” I ordered Nick.  

 

He did. I let him take the first few swings, smashing the stupid robot to bits, while Edith cheered him on. I finished the job, and chopped it into a million pieces. Then I buried the mechanical monster in the yard.   

 

Flustered, I took the kids out for lunch. They were uncharacteristically quiet. It’s not every day a Halloween costume comes to life and tries to kill you. I spent the rest of the day trying my darndest to cheer them up. It’s their first Halloween without their dear mother, after all.  

  

We stopped at a local costume shop on the way home, and Nick picked out a Spiderman costume. Nice and safe. They had a blast trick-or-treating. I wished my wife was with us. Maybe she was. Perhaps she was looking down from Heaven. If so, she’s probably laughing at us. Humor was her greatest strength, after all.    

  

Sleep didn’t come that night. How could it? I kept expecting an alien-bot to kill my kids. Ridiculous, I know. But every hour, I checked up on them. Then I searched around the house. Just in case.  The following morning, I was dead tired. But at least the kids seemed okay. Children have a wonderful way of coping, don’t they?


Later that day, just before dinner, something caught my attention in the yard: a gathering of animals.   

  

“What the?”  

  

I looked out the window, and frowned. 


My heart halted. 


Oh good God. This can’t be happening. Not now.  

 

But it was.  

 

I ran into the yard, wielding my Glock 19. Blood was on my mind. The squirrels and buzzards scrammed. Somewhere, a dog barked. I marched to the edge of the yard. The hole was dug up. I peaked inside and groaned. It was empty. Like a man possessed, I scavenged the perimeters of the house, gun cocked and loaded.


""Where’s that carking collection of spare parts?""  

 

After several trips around the house, I stopped to wipe the sweat from my brow. My hands were trembling. I really was losing my mind. Robots don’t come to life. Nor do they return from the dead. The sun was sinking. A cool breeze swept across the yard. The feeling of being watched was impossible to ignore. It was out there somewhere, taunting me.


 “Wor-wor-wor.”

**\~\~\~**

\[One\] hour later in the underground parking hideout.



Captain Hicks sat on a crate of emergency medical supplies, cleaning his rifle with movements that had become automatic after fifteen years of military service. The rhythmic scraping of the cleaning rod against metal provided small comfort in the underground chaos that Safe Zone Delta had become.  
  


*Small comforts. That's all we have left now.*

  
Dr. Sarah Chen approached with a steaming cup of something that might charitably be called coffee. ""You look like you could use this more than I could.""

""Thanks, Doc."" Hicks accepted the cup gratefully, inhaling the bitter aroma that reminded him of better times. ""How are our supplies holding up?""

""Food and water will last maybe six more hours at current consumption rates,"" she said, settling onto another crate beside him. Her voice carried the exhaustion of someone who'd been making impossible decisions for too long. ""The real problem is morale. People are starting to ask questions I don't have answers for.""

  
*Questions like 'why hasn't anyone come to rescue us' and 'when will this nightmare end.' Questions I've been asking myself.*

  
Through the makeshift medical area, he could see families huddled around battery-powered lanterns, their faces hollow with exhaustion and fear. Children who should have been playing in school yards sat silent and wide-eyed, processing horrors no child should witness. Elderly citizens who'd survived the Border Wars now faced something that made those conflicts look like playground disputes.

  
*Three hundred souls are depending on me to somehow make this right. Three hundred people who think I have a plan beyond 'survive the next hour.'*

  
""Captain,"" Dr. Chen said quietly, ""can I ask you something?""

""Shoot.""

""Do you really think we can get these people out of here alive?""

Hicks paused in his cleaning, considering the question with the honesty it deserved. The truth was grim—creatures outside were getting smarter and more coordinated by the hour, their ammunition was running dangerously low, and the pressure field made surface evacuation impossible for most civilians.

  
*But she's not asking for a tactical assessment. She's asking if I still have hope.*

  
""Doctor,"" he said finally, ""I've seen impossible situations before. Sometimes what looks like certain death is just... the setup for something better. The key is staying alive long enough to see it.""

  
*And sometimes, certain death is exactly that. But these people need hope more than brutal honesty.*

  
Across the parking structure, he spotted Hawthorne sitting with a group of children, her ever-present smile somehow coaxing giggles from kids who'd witnessed unspeakable horrors. One little girl—couldn't be more than seven—was actually laughing as Hawthorne made funny faces and told silly jokes.

  
*She's been a godsend with the kids. If it weren't for her, we'd probably have complete panic on our hands.*

  
But even as he watched, something nagged at him. The way she moved through shadows between emergency lights always seemed to know exactly where to step to avoid debris. How her uniform, despite being torn and bloodstained, never accumulated the dust and grime that covered everyone else.

  
*Stop it, Ulrich. You're seeing patterns that aren't there because you're exhausted. Hawthorne saved those kids' sanity. Focus on what matters.*

  
""Captain,"" Sergeant Volkov appeared at his elbow, speaking in the low tones they'd all adopted. ""Perimeter check complete. No movement in the immediate area, but I'm picking up energy signatures three blocks east. Something big.""

""How big?""

""Bigger than the construction unit we took down. Multiple energy sources, coordinated movement patterns."" Volkov's expression was grim. ""Sir, whatever's out there isn't hunting randomly. It's surveying. Mapping.""

  
*They're planning something. The question is what, and how much time do we have to prepare?*

  
Before Hicks could respond, an explosion echoed through the parking structure, sending concrete dust raining from the ceiling. Emergency lights flickered, casting wild shadows that made the huddled civilians look like refugees from hell itself.

Screams erupted as chunks of concrete crashed down. Children cried, adults shouted contradictory orders, and the careful organization Dr. Chen had built collapsed into chaos.

""Contact!"" Webb shouted from the main entrance, his voice cutting through the pandemonium. ""Multiple hostiles approaching from the north entrance! Big ones, moving fast!""

  
*Ambush. The fucking things tracked us here.*

  
Hicks's mind shifted into combat mode, exhaustion falling away like a discarded coat. The parking structure offered excellent defensive positions—concrete pillars for cover, elevated firing positions on upper levels, chokepoints at every entrance—but limited escape routes. If they were surrounded, the civilians would be trapped.

  
*Three hundred innocent people. I won't let them be harvested.*

  
""Volkov, take Devon and Vasquez. Establish overwatch positions on Level Two. Webb, set charges on the support columns—if we get overwhelmed, we bring the whole thing down rather than let them take the civilians.""

  
*Better to die quickly in a collapse than slowly in whatever processing facility these things are running.*

  
""What about Hawthorne?"" Volkov asked, her voice carrying that edge of suspicion he'd been trying to ignore.

Hicks looked around and realized he'd lost sight of her in the chaos. Just moments before, she'd been entertaining children near the medical station, but now...

  
*Where did she go? In all this noise and confusion, how does someone just disappear?*

  
""Find her and—""

His words were cut off as something massive crashed through the north wall, sending chunks of reinforced concrete flying like shrapnel. Through the breach came creatures unlike any they'd encountered—tall, humanoid, but wrong.

  
*How in hell are they making new variants this fast!*

  
Where previous creatures had been obviously artificial, these carried an aura of organic wrongness that suggested they'd once been something else.

  
*Something human.*

  
The battle erupted with sudden violence that transformed the underground sanctuary into hell. Energy weapons carved through the air, leaving trails of superheated plasma that turned concrete to glass. Conventional firearms barked defiance, muzzle flashes strobing like deadly fireworks.

But something was wrong. Hicks felt it immediately—a dead weight in his chest where his Mantle should be singing with power.

""My fucking Mantle!"" Devon cursed, trying repeatedly to activate his \[Sharpshooter's Focus\] to no avail. ""It's like hitting a wall!""

""Same here!"" Vasquez's voice cracked with panic as she fumbled for her medical kit instead of relying on her \[Healer's Touch\]. ""The essence is completely suppressed!""

  
*The veil. The goddamn veil is blocking Mantle access. The only reason I can feel mine at all is because I'm Order III.*

  
But even Hicks could feel the interference—his \[Guardian's Resolve\] was sluggish, fighting against the oppressive field that turned air thick as molasses. For his Order I and II squad members, it was like trying to breathe underwater.

The creatures advanced, energy weapons carving through cover like paper. Webb went down first, his explosive charges scattered unfired as concentrated fire turned him to vapor before he could reach adequate shelter.

  
*Webb. Fuck, Webb.*

  
Devon's wounded leg prevented him from finding adequate cover. He died cursing, emptying his magazine into the nearest creature before return fire silenced him forever.

Vasquez lasted longer, her medical training helping her identify cover, but eventually the coordinated assault overwhelmed her position. She died trying to reach a wounded civilian, her final act pure selflessness.

  
*Elena. God damn it, Elena.*

  
Hicks fought with desperate fury, his Order III Mantle giving him advantages despite the suppression—enhanced reflexes, reinforced bones, and the ability to survive impacts that would have killed his subordinates. But it wasn't enough.

Volkov went down fighting, her special forces training allowing her to take three creatures with her before concentrated fire overwhelmed her position. Her last act was to look directly at Hicks and mouth a single word: ""Run.""

  
*They're all dead. My entire squad is dead because I didn't trust my instincts about that thing wearing Hawthorne's face.*

  
Hicks found himself alone in the ruins of what had been a safe zone, surrounded by bodies of people he'd sworn to protect. But it wasn't just his squad that was gone—the civilians were... changed.

Dr. Chen sat perfectly still beside an overturned medical crate, her eyes reflecting light like polished glass. Children who'd been laughing at Hawthorne's jokes now stood in unnaturally straight lines, their small faces blank and expressionless. Elderly citizens who'd survived decades of hardship stared at nothing with the empty gaze of broken dolls.

  
*Processed. That's what they called it. They're being processed for the Convergence.*

  
Their bodies remained intact, but something fundamental had been removed. The spark of consciousness, the essence of what made them human, had been extracted and stored elsewhere.

  
*Three hundred souls. Three hundred lives reduced to empty shells.*

  
""Oh dear,"" said a voice behind him, light and conversational. ""That didn't go very well, did it?""

Hicks turned to find Hawthorne picking her way through debris with careful steps, her uniform somehow cleaner than before the battle. Her voice was the same, but the inflection was wrong—too precise, like someone reading memorized lines without understanding their meaning.

  
*Order IV. Has to be Order IV minimum to have resisted the veil's suppression so completely.*

  
""You're not her,"" Hicks said, raising his rifle with hands that shook from exhaustion and grief. ""You're not Hawthorne.""

""Very good, Captain,"" she replied, clapping her hands together like congratulating a bright student. ""Though it took you rather longer to figure out than I expected. I was beginning to worry that I'd been too subtle with my performance.""

  
*How long? How long has this thing been wearing her face, listening to our plans, learning our weaknesses?*

  
""What did you do with her?""

""Patricia?"" The thing wearing Hawthorne's face tilted its head with predatory curiosity. ""Oh, she's been dead for hours, Captain. Such a lovely girl, though. She had the most interesting memories about all of you. Made it very easy to play my part.""

As she spoke, her right hand began to change. Fingers elongated into razor-sharp talons, nails hardened into obsidian claws, and skin took on a metallic sheen that reflected emergency lighting in patterns that hurt to look at directly.

Hicks forced power through his suppressed Mantle, feeling \[Guardian's Resolve\] flare to life despite the oppressive field. His aura blazed around him, providing the first real light the parking garage had seen since emergency power failed.

""The civilians,"" Hicks said, backing toward what remained of the exit while keeping his weapon trained on the creature. ""What about the civilians?""

""Oh, they're not dead,"" the creature said conversationally, as if discussing the weather. ""Death would be wasteful, and the Convergence requires efficiency above all else. They're being processed for transport to the cathedral. Every life has value in the great work, Captain. Even yours.""

  
*Three hundred people. Three hundred souls fed to whatever nightmare these cultists are trying to birth.*

  
Hicks squeezed the trigger, putting three rounds center mass into the cultist wearing Trish's face. The bullets passed through without effect, as if she were made of dense smoke.

  
*Damn it!*

  
""Captain Hicks,"" it said, advancing with leisurely confidence, ""did you really think conventional weapons would affect me? I'm disappointed. Your reputation suggested more.""

  
*This is it. This is how I die. Alone in a parking garage, talking to a monster wearing a dead woman's face.*

  
But even as death approached on clawed feet, Hicks felt grim satisfaction. His squad was dead, but they'd completed their mission. They'd confirmed the cathedral as the attack source, mapped enemy capabilities, and provided intelligence that might help other teams survive what was coming.

  
*Vienna will remember. Someone will remember what we tried to do here.*

  
The creature's claw swept toward his throat with surgical precision. Hicks felt his aura shatter like glass against its superior power. The talon pierced his neck, severing arteries and crushing his windpipe in a single, efficient motion.

As his life drained across concrete, Hicks used his final moments of consciousness to dip his finger in his own blood. With shaking hands, he traced three symbols on the floor beside his body—military code that only another guard would recognize.

  
*O-4-C: Order IV Cultist.*

*Let someone find this. Let them know what they're really fighting.*

  
Captain Ulrich Hicks died knowing that his sacrifice had meaning, even if he would never see the results.

  
\*\*\*

  
The cultist who had been wearing Patricia Hawthorne's face knelt beside Hicks's body, studying his features with detached interest of a scientist examining a specimen. The claws retracted back into human fingernails, and its face resumed the cheerful expression that had made it such an effective infiltrator.

  
*Such brave little insects. They really believed they could make a difference against forces beyond their comprehension.*

  
From deeper in the parking structure came sounds of its brethren processing the remaining civilians—not killing them, but preparing them for transport to the cathedral district. The Convergence required specific types of sacrifice, and living humans provided much better raw material than corpses.

  
*Quality over quantity. The Hierarch is quite particular about these things.*

  
The cultist's enhanced senses detected another squad approaching from the east, drawn by battle sounds like moths to flame. Team Foxtrot, if its stolen memories were correct, six more guards who believed they were rescuing survivors.

  
*Perfect. Another opportunity to have some fun... life in the cult is so boring!*

  
The cultist examined its current appearance, noting blood and tears that marked its supposed ordeal. But for the deception to work against fresh targets, it needed to look more convincingly wounded. The new arrivals would be suspicious if they found an uninjured survivor in the middle of a massacre.

  
*Details matter in any good performance. Method acting at its finest.*

  
As the sounds of the approaching squad grew louder, the creature arranged itself among bodies in a pose suggesting someone who'd barely survived a horrific attack. It even managed to produce tears—genuine human tears extracted from stolen memories of grief and loss.

  
*When Team Foxtrot's point man appears at that entrance, weapon ready and eyes scanning for threats, he'll find what appears to be a critically wounded survivor lying among the dead.*

*They'll rescue me. They'll bring me back to their base of operations, where I can enjoy myself. And when the time is right, I'll open the doors and let my true family inside to finish the work.*

  
The creature's laughter was perfectly human in pitch and tone, but it carried harmonics that no human throat had ever produced. In the darkness of Vienna's dying night, it waited for the next act of its performance to begin.

  
*The city is almost ready for harvest, and every soul will serve the greater purpose of the Convergence.*

Harper watched Megan dash out of sight before he freed the rest of his limbs. He grabbed the lantern,  stepped out of the cabin, and looked up at the moon as it held its place in the center of the sky. Harper didn’t know where he was and the moon essentially told him that he’d need to survive at least 5 hours or find a way to escape. He scanned the area around the cabin and was confused by the absence of a vehicle, wondering to himself, “Then how did she get me all the way out here?” 
Harper set the thought aside for later and decided to just high-tail it in the opposite direction he saw Megan flee to. Harper traversed the terrain as quickly as he could, never the sporty type but adrenaline had his legs working like they never had before. He was thankful for the lantern’s light as he narrowly avoided rolling his ankle. Harper had in mind what he believed Megan to be and if he was right, he couldn’t risk hindering himself in any sort of way. Although, he was certain there was no plausible way for him to fight her off once she caught him. Harper stopped and looked at the knife he still had. He contemplated the idea of ruining this hunting ritual by taking the easy way out. After all, she correctly picked him as a loner. Harper set the lantern on a branch and  deployed the utility knife’s blade. He brought it up to his neck, specifically the aortic artery.
“I can choose to end it here,” Harper thought to himself.  He then laughed at the idea of essentially giving a supernatural beast the middle finger by robbing it of the satisfaction of the kill. Then a second thought popped into his head, “You’ve always wanted to,” and the air suddenly felt colder.
It didn’t just have to be an escape from a monster, it could be the escape from his life. No more stress, no more pain, no more disappointment: Harper could be free. He put the knife’s edge against his skin and then he thought about his family. Harper’s hand froze and tears began to build up in his eyes as he struggled not to break down. Harper thought about his family never hearing back from him, never knowing what had happened, and how the lack of closure would haunt them. They’d be stuck worrying about the worst or even the possibility that Harper had decided to cut ties completely and start anew. Harper knew he’d never do that to them, it was bad enough when he moved to a different city. He remembered seeing the reluctant acceptance in his mother’s eyes the day he moved out, his older brother would later tell him that she cried that night and that prompted Harper to call at least once a week. He didn’t want her to be stuck at the phone waiting for him to finally check in. Harper put the knife away, grabbed the lantern, and kicked into a sprint with newfound determination. Then he heard it.
The first howl echoed through the forest and stopped Harper in his tracks. It was like a wolf’s but deeper and in a way corrupted, as he interpreted a human bellowing right alongside it. Harper felt every hair on his body stand at attention as his skin rippled with fear. His burst of energy almost completely drained, but Harper managed to save enough to get him running again. He felt like he needed to make a drastic move to inconvenience Megan and improve his chances of escape. Harper thought about his scent, looked at his shirt, and set the lantern down. He took his shirt off and rubbed it all over himself before launching it to the right and continuing his escape. Harper figured it was a decent, momentary distraction while he searched for a drastic measure to take. Harper noticed that the land steadily grew steeper and as he looked ahead, something made him come to an abrupt stop. It was the edge of a cliff and beyond that were treetops. Harper walked up to the edge, looked down, and saw it was a straight drop. This was exactly what Harper needed, now it was just a matter of finding a way down. He undid his belt and fed it through the handle of the lantern as he considered his options. That’s when a second howl cut through the air and pushed Harper into action. He latched his belt, took several steps back, ran towards the edge of the cliff, and jumped at the last moment towards a nearby tree.
Harper didn’t expect grace and finesse upon his landing, he just hoped he’d be cohesive enough to grab on to something instead of falling and leaving himself defenseless. His initial contact with the tree was met with bruises and scratches as he collided with branch after branch before landing gut-first onto a thick enough branch to stop his momentum. Harper dry heaved as he lowered himself to another sizable branch and stopped to gather himself. His body ached all over but he had managed to get about halfway down the tree already. Harper mindlessly looked up and immediately held his breath. At the edge of the cliff stood a towering figure draped in fur mimicking hazelnut flames. As it scanned the area the moonlight would occasionally reflect the same raw sienna off its eyes like Megan’s did back in the cabin. Harper was made witness of Megan in her full, beastly terror. She let out a growl with hints of annoyance and then darted away from the edge, surely looking for a way down. Harper continued with his own way down and once he was, he examined the array of marks on his torso. Thankfully the cuts hadn’t bled much, so his position wasn’t further compromised. Harper freed the lantern from his belt, put the cliff to his back, and began another sprint through the forest. He felt like he was making great progress when he abruptly stopped at the sight of a stool, one used for camping. Harper initially asked himself, “Did someone leave this behind,” and was immediately answered by a booming, “Hey!”

Harper looked to his right and saw a man emerging from a tent and aiming a handgun at him. The gun had a flashlight fixed to it, illuminating the setting and revealing a second tent to the man’s right. The man had short, dirty blonde hair and wore a red and black flannel paired with tan cargo pants. Harper heard a click and then the man demanded, “What the hell are you doing at our camp?”
Harper put his hands up and said, “I didn’t know you were out here. I got lost when something started chasing me.”
“Something? Is it the same something that let out those howls earlier,” the man asked with less aggression in his tone. 
“It looked like a bear but bears don’t howl,” Harper said with clear unease. Harper heard another click, unbeknownst to him that it was the safety of the gun, and then heard the second tent’s zipper open. Another man popped his head out, observed the scene, and asked, “Why’s dude shirtless?”
“That doesn’t matter, but we gotta get out of here,” the first man declared. He lowered the gun and slightly turned his head toward the tent he exited, “Naomi, please get our stuff together, we’ll come back for the tents and sleeping bags in the morning.” 
“Is everything okay,” Naomi asked from within the tent.
“Yeah but it’s best we don’t stay the night,” the man responded. Then he extended his hand towards Harper and said, “I’m Bobby, I’m guessing you’ll be needing a ride.”
Harper fulfilled the handshake and said, “Yes, please, I don’t know where my car is at this point and all I’ve got is this lantern and a box cutter in my pocket.”
“Had to scramble that urgently, huh,” inquired Bobby, “And what about your shirt?”
“I ditched it to try to throw my scent into a different direction and buy me some time,” Harper answered. 
“Clever, but you left yourself even more susceptible to the elements,” Bobby commented while observing Harper’s collection of injuries, “As far as I can tell there’s nothing major, but we’ve got some disinfectant spray you can use.”
Harper thanked him and soon they were joined by the rest of Bobby’s ensemble. They set out on the walk back to Bobby’s truck. 

Harper would go on to meet the rest of the crew, starting with Bobby’s girlfriend, Naomi. She stood just under eye level with Harper and hid her long, black hair under a navy, baseball cap. She wore a black, long sleeved shirt and pants that matched Bobby’s. Naomi was suspicious of Harper and would occasionally glance at him while her and Bobby led the group. Harper held the middle and was followed by another couple: Carter and Olivia. Carter was a head taller than Harper, though not as tall as Bobby, and had short, black hair. He wore a tan sweatshirt paired with black jeans and had given Harper a black shirt to wear, which Harper had to tuck in due to the excess length. Olivia stood about chin level with Harper and had medium-length, black hair. She wore a maroon hoodie paired with blue jeans and a hip bag reminiscent of a gun holster. Carter and Olivia were more easygoing and friendlier with Harper than Bobby and Naomi were.
“So you just full-sent that shit,” Carter asked Harper after hearing about his cliff jump. 
“I don’t think I woulda been able to climb down its side even in the daytime,” Harper remarked. 
“This is exactly why men have a lower life expectancy than women,” Olivia joked while Carter nodded in agreement.
“But hey, you survived that and an encounter with John Wick over there,” Carter said as he motioned over to Bobby.
Without turning his head, Bobby fired back, “You’ve got one too, jackass.”
“Goddamnit, Bobby, why’d you have to give up my element of surprise,” Carter remarked while drawing a handgun from behind himself, “Like what if Harper turns out to be a serial killer?”
“I’m pretty sure you guys can take me,” Harper said as he looked up at Carter, “At best I have a box cutter.”
“That’s an unusual knife to have when you’re out in the woods,” Naomi said while glancing back at Harper, “Maybe for field dressing game but then you’d be short a rifle.”
“I don’t hunt and it was just the first thing I could grab aside from the lantern,” Harper explained.
Naomi dragged out a “Right,” before turning her head forward and leaving the group in a moment of awkward silence. Carter took it upon himself to break the tension, “So Harper is a unique name for a guy, is there a story behind that?”
“Yeah, my parents already had my older brother and my mom so badly wanted a girl next that she didn’t even consider the chance of having a boy. So she only thought of girl names and eventually fell in love with the name ‘Harper’. When they found out I was a boy through ultrasound, my mom was devastated. She didn’t want to risk not being able to use the name if they were to only have boys and my dad agreed to give me that name,” Harper told the group.
“It must’ve been rough with the way kids are,” Bobby commented.
“Some adults too,” Harper added on, “But over time I stopped letting them get to me. My mom loves the name so why should I be ashamed of it?”
“That’s really sweet,” Olivia said while Naomi took a brief glance at Harper.
“Meanwhile my dad named me after the character from Rush Hour, one of his all time favorite movies,” Carter said, “But he didn’t want to name me after the Chinese character to avoid confusion and chose Carter instead.”
“Carter and I are Hmong, by the way,” Olivia interjected, “Naomi is Thai and Bobby is our token white guy,” which prompted a lackadaisical wave from Bobby.
“So we’re about two shades away from being the ideal cover for a college brochure,” Carter said.
“I guess I don’t offer much to the mix; my dad’s mom is Mexican but that still leaves me predominantly white,” Harper said.
“Hold on now, that bit of native Mexican in you still counts so embrace that shit,” Carter said with a smile. Harper was about to ask something when a howl froze the group. The howl sounded alarmingly close, perhaps only as far back as the campsite was. 
Bobby broke the group out of its stasis when he said, “The truck is 10 minutes away walking, we gotta run. Carter and I will be in the back in case it catches up to us.”
Olivia now joined Naomi at the front, setting the pace as the guys followed behind. Harper’s mind filled with thoughts of guilt and concern, “Fuck! I really thought I could escape but now I’ve dragged this group into this.”
A second thought popped into his head, “Maybe I should’ve killed my-”
Suddenly, Harper heard something tearing its way through the forest behind them. He went against his better instinct and looked back, seeing a dark figure closing in on them. Carter had heard the animal charging towards them but the sudden spike of fear in Harper’s eyes made him realize it was much closer than he’d like. Carter stopped, turned his body around, raised his gun at the black mass ahead of him, and fired. Bobby stopped as soon as the first shot rang out and joined Carter in building a wall of gunfire. Their flashlights and muzzle flashes steadily pieced together the true visage of their pursuer. The expectation of a bear heightened the shock brought by the reveal when a wolf-like head burst through the darkness as its imposing build either avoided or ignored the gunfire. Carter stopped firing for just a second as he became a deer in headlights, then snapped out of it and landed two solid shots into the beast’s torso as it lunged at him. A monstrous hand eclipsed Carter’s chest and stamped him onto the ground, cracking several ribs and concussing him in the process. The beast dug its claws into Carter then raised him up for a monstrous bite onto his neck, tearing out a chunk and devouring it before returning for more. Olivia cried out while Naomi held her back and dragged her in the truck’s direction. Harper stood there, almost resigned to share the same fate as Carter, when a roar from Bobby shook him out of it. Bobby unloaded the remainder of his gun’s magazine into the beast and yet the beast remained unbothered as it continued to devour Carter. Bobby didn’t allow himself to get stuck in a catatonic state, instead he commanded everyone to run and they followed. The group’s frantic footsteps and breathing flowed through the trees as they heard another howl, marking the start of another chase. The beast’s movement made it seem as if the group hadn’t cleared any distance since they left the scene of Carter’s demise. To little relief the truck was in sight and was unlocked more than twice by Bobby as he used his key fob like a stress ball. Olivia lost her footing and though she only needed a second to get back up, she and the group froze at the sight of the beast having caught up to them. 
They watched as it rose from all fours and onto its hind legs. Aided by the moonlight, they were able to pin the identity of this monstrosity to something they had only witnessed through works of fiction: a werewolf. It bared its teeth, their off-whiteness contrasting against the muzzle, having been darkened with Carter’s blood. Bobby handed the keys to Naomi, looked her deep in her eyes, and nodded. Naomi nodded and then pulled Bobby in for a tight hug and a kiss she wished wouldn’t be their last. Naomi then signaled to the others to make their way to the truck. The werewolf growled at the first sign of movement but shifted its attention to Bobby after he whistled at it. Bobby reloaded and then gripped his gun as hard as he could to not let the building sweat make it slip out of his grasp. 
Bobby thought about the first time he met Carter, back in elementary school. He never thought they’d follow each other to middle school, high school, and even remain friends after going to different colleges. Bobby had many “best friends” but he would only refer to Carter as his ‘brother’. Memories they shared flooded his head and instead of succumbing to grief, Bobby let out a primal roar and fired. The werewolf got back onto all fours and serpentined its way through the gunfire. Its movement was unhindered by the bullets that did manage to hit the mark and the werewolf ultimately closed the distance with a leap. Its mouth opened wide enough to easily fit Bobby’s head, but its target was Bobby's right arm. It clamped down like a bear trap springing to action. The werewolf’s bite sliced through muscle, crushed bone, and the momentum of the attack brought both of them onto the ground. The werewolf further eviscerated Bobby’s arm with twists of its head, seemingly trying to yank out his arm completely. Bobby was left unable to hear anything and his vision cycled in and out of darkness as his main focus was the scorching pain emanating from his right arm, never mind the claws dug into his left shoulder to keep him pinned down. The only comfort he had left was knowing he’d see Carter on the other side. Then a blur of maroon rushed into his field of vision as Olivia drove a bowie knife into the neck of the werewolf. The werewolf remained undeterred with its attack until Olivia began to repeatedly stab its neck. The werewolf swung its arm at Olivia, launching her away, and then charged at her. Before it got to Olivia, the werewolf was intercepted by Harper when he swung the lantern at the left side of its face. The hot glass tore into its flesh while the oil lit its fur ablaze, causing the werewolf to halt its offence altogether. Before it could completely recover, Naomi shot the werewolf in the chest. 
After Olivia had double backed to help Bobby, Naomi had counted on Bobby’s tendency to hoard things in his truck. And true to Bobby’s nature, Naomi found his pump action shotgun and a box of buckshot rounds stashed within the truck. She forced the werewolf to retreat with two more blasts of the boomstick, one of them tearing open its already wounded neck. Naomi kept the shotgun trained at the trees while Olivia and Harper rushed over to Bobby, still clinging to life. Olivia helped Harper get Bobby in a fireman’s carry and grabbed her bowie knife. 
They all packed into the truck with Harper joining Bobby in the backseat and Olivia riding shotgun while holding the shotgun. Naomi carefully raced down the dirt road and kept her head on a swivel. She looked in the rear view mirror and yelled, “Keep pressure on it,” to Harper as he wrapped a blanket around Bobby’s right arm. With further instruction, he used his belt as a tourniquet at the base of Bobby’s right shoulder. Bobby no longer acknowledged the pain as he murmured incoherently and let his head bob from left to middle and back, subconsciously avoiding looking at his right side. Seeing Bobby in his current condition and remembering Carter’s body on the ground further fueled the raging inferno of resentment Harper had for himself, “This is all my fault.”
“There’s a left turn coming up,” Olivia said as she recounted their drive earlier that day, “And then it should be a straight shot back to the road.”
“How far do you think we are from the closest city,” Naomi asked.
“I wanna say we’re less than half an hour away from Two Harbors,” Olivia said.
“I’d make it in 15 if we were already on pavement,” Naomi huffed.
Harper felt Bobby tug on his sleeve and so he asked, “What is it?”
“Take care… of each other,”  Bobby managed to get out. He began to drift off into what could be the final sleep.
“Hey,” Harper said as he raised Bobby’s head, “Stay with us, Bobby. We’ll take care of each other and that includes you.”
Bobby simply looked at him and shook his head just enough to get the point across. The truck’s tires gripped onto pavement and Naomi instantly felt revitalized. She floored it but then something hit the side of the truck like a pit maneuver and the truck spun out. When Naomi got control of the truck again, she looked out the rear view and saw the werewolf standing in the center of the road. It charged and leapt onto the roof of the truck just as it was picking up speed. The truck swerved as Naomi tried to shake off the werewolf. It started hacking at the roof, making a hole right above Olivia. Olivia turned her body around and shot up at the werewolf. It bellowed in pain but continued trying to get into the cabin of the truck. Olivia shot again and this time the werewolf halted its attempt to further open up a hole in the roof. Olivia racked what she hoped to be the final shot she’d need, but the werewolf’s right arm bursted through the roof and impaled her before she could pull the trigger. Olivia screamed out and looked down to see two of the werewolf’s claws stabbed into the left side of her midsection, right below her rib cage. The werewolf ripped its claws out of Olivia and attempted to stab them into Naomi’s head, but Naomi was able to lean back enough to avoid the attack. The werewolf then shaped its claw with the intent of using it like a bear trap on Naomi’s face, but Olivia sent her third shot into the werewolf's shoulder and forced it to retreat. 
“Harper, take over for me,” Olivia said as she handed Harper the shotgun and put pressure on her wound. Harper’s hands shook as he pumped the shotgun and readied himself to use it. The werewolf’s hands popped in from the roof and gripped the edge of the hole, widening it with little resistance. Once it was at a sufficient width the werewolf popped its head into the truck’s cabin and let out a roar like a death toll for the group, only to be met with the barrel of the shotgun being jammed into its mouth. Harper pulled the trigger and the werewolf’s head snapped out through the hole faster than it entered. The werewolf would’ve fallen completely off of the truck if it weren’t for the claws of its left hand anchoring it. Instead, the mass and momentum of the werewolf’s nigh unconscious body caused the truck to lurch off the road. Everyone just barely got their seatbelts on when the truck started to roll, aggravated by the eventual launch of the werewolf’s body off the roof.

The truck finally settled on the driver’s side, luckily Harper had managed to avoid all serious bumps and remained coherent. He called out, “Is everyone okay?”
Naomi and Olivia groaned in response, Bobby didn’t answer. Harper then said, “Let’s crawl through the hole. I’ll help Bobby through as soon as you guys get out.”
Naomi and Olivia got themselves, Naomi’s backpack, and the shotgun out through the substantial hole in the truck’s roof. Harper managed to free himself without landing on Bobby and then stopped. Before reaching to free Bobby from his seatbelt, Harper checked his pulse. “No, no, no,” Harper screamed within his head as he frantically freed Bobby and dragged him out of the truck. He immediately screamed, “ I didn’t feel a pulse!”
Naomi had been dressing Olivia’s wound when Olivia nodded at her to check on Bobby. Naomi knelt next to Bobby and checked his pulse. Her eyes widened and she began administering chest compressions. Harper could hear her softly whisper, “Come on, come on, please,” and watched tears fall from face as she tried to jump start Bobby’s heart. After the longest minute in Harper’s life, Naomi broke down and sobbed into Bobby’s chest. Olivia came over and comforted Naomi while expressing just as much grief. Both had lost their partners, both didn’t want to continue without them, but both knew exactly what their partners would say and found the strength to stand up. Naomi got her backpack and the shotgun while Harper helped Olivia get back onto the road. Harper looked back at Bobby’s body, told him “We’ll take care of each other,” through his thoughts, and then began walking to Two Harbors.


Twenty minutes had gone by and the road continued to stretch onwards. Naomi maintained the shotgun in standby while her eyes actively scanned the area. Harper carried Olivia via piggyback to make it easier for them and help her conserve her energy. Besides Harper offering to carry Olivia, words hadn’t been spoken since they started their walk. The deaths of Bobby and Carter weighed heavy on the trio almost to the point of numbing them to the lingering danger they still found themselves in. Despite the egregious damage the werewolf had taken they hadn’t confirmed a dead body and had to assume the hunt would resume at any moment. Naomi broke the silence and pointed ahead, “Look, there’s a road. I’ll go check where it leads to.”
“I hope it’s a house or anywhere with a phone,” Olivia meekly responded as Naomi jogged ahead. Naomi reached the entry and took a long look before calling back, “There’s a house at the end of the road, come on!”
Harper hurried over and kept up the pace as Naomi led them down the road. In no time they reached the driveway where a pick-up truck stood trailed by a buggy. Harper noted visible tracks leading up the driveway to the buggy, they looked pretty fresh. He then noticed that even Naomi took note of the tracks as well. She didn’t get hung up on them and hastingly made her way to the front door, prompting Harper to set that thought aside and follow after her. But Naomi suddenly stopped at the base of the stairs, looked at the bushes to her left, and quickly knelt down to hide the shotgun under them. When she stood back up she turned to Harper and Olivia and explained, “I don’t want to scare them with it, plus we shouldn’t need it anymore.”
Naomi continued to the door, rang the doorbell twice, and then stepped away when she noticed the Ring cam. Naomi allows a long moment of inactivity before ringing the doorbell twice more. Through the speaker an irritated, older man asked, “Who are you and what do you want?”
“We’ve been in an accident, sir, and our friend needs to get to a hospital,” Naomi spoke with a quickness, “We’re not asking to come inside, just that you call an ambulance for us.”
There was a pause so Naomi continued, “Please just call 911, we’ll even wait at the end of the road.”
“No, no, I’m already heading down and my wife’s on the phone with them,” the man answered dismissively. 
“Thank you so much, sir, we don’t mean to be a bother,” Naomi said, which was answered with a single “yeup”. 
The door was opened by a man looking to be in his late 40s. He had some salt and peppering going on except for his beard, which appeared to be a deep black; his brown eyes and slightly tanned skin didn’t provide much contrast. He stood about the same height as Carter and wore a gray t-shirt with blue, pajama bottoms. 
“Oh gosh, you kids are worse for wear than the camera showed,” the man exclaimed and then stepped aside, “Please come in, you can sit her down onto the couch.”
“Thank you so much. Do you have a first aid kit or anything I can use to dress her wounds again in the meantime,” Naomi asked.
The man closed the door after them and answered, “Of course, I’ll go get it.”
“No need,” a woman cut in as she handed Naomi a first aid kit, “I went for it as soon as I hung up. The paramedics are on their way.”
Naomi thanked her and rushed over to Olivia’s side. Naomi’s roadside first aid had managed to slow down the bleeding enough to keep Olivia present, though she could tell Olivia was far from okay. Harper sat on the opposite side and watched Naomi get to work, somewhat to hopefully learn something but mainly he had nothing else to contribute. He observed the woman to be about Naomi’s height, slightly younger looking than the man, with hair and eyes of the same brown that made up the man’s eyes.  She wore a light blue bathrobe and matching pajama bottoms. She spoke up, “My name is Beth and this is my husband, Frank, you all look like you could use some grub so I’ll be right back.”
Harper was about to stop her from burdening herself, but Frank raised his hand and shook his head with a smile, “There’s no talking her out of it, the minute someone walks through our door she’s already taking into account what she can feed them with. Plus the one in the middle definitely needs something to regain her energy. What exactly happened to you kids?”
“We were attacked by a bear,” Harper began with the lie he had already been planning to use, “It got two of our friends and although we got to the truck, it then caused us to veer off the road.”
“I’m sorry to hear that, how did you manage to get away,” Frank asked.
Naomi answered, “We used my boyfriend’s shotgun.”
“Why didn’t you keep the shotgun with you,” Frank followed up.
“There wasn’t extra ammo, just what was loaded, so I left it. Can’t really trick a bear with an unloaded gun, right,” Naomi answered with a hint of levity.
Frank chuckled, “It would be real nice if you could. That is strange for a bear to outright attack people.”
“Yeah, we haven’t been able to make sense of it,” Harper said.
“If not rabies then maybe it was a mama bear. Maybe you all unknowingly got too close to her cubs and she retaliated out of defense. After all, it’s a key role of parents to protect their young by any means necessary,” Frank said.
Harper felt that Frank was the type of person that needed to fill in dead air with any kind of dialogue, but that last line felt oddly targeted.
“Here you go, kids,” Beth exclaimed as she entered the room with a tray containing three drinks and a plate of diagonally-cut sandwiches, “I figured why bother with water if we’ve got lemonade available.”
Beth placed the tray on the coffee table as the trio thanked her for the nourishment and wasted no time by digging in immediately. Beth excused herself back to the kitchen while Frank decided to wait outside for the ambulance, leaving the three alone in the living room.
“We got really lucky running into such nice people,” Naomi remarked. 
“Yeah, they remind me a bit of my parents,” Harper said. 
Olivia put down her lemonade and said, “I think I’ll take a nap while we wait for the ambulance, I’m exhausted.”
Harper and Naomi got up from the couch so Olivia could readjust herself to rest on it. Naomi opted to sit on the floor next to Olivia while Harper took a tour of the living room. He noticed pictures on the mantle and knew the couple gave off such paternal/ maternal vibes for a reason. The first couple of photos were of the couple at a younger age along with their children embarking on various outdoor activities. Seeing as the pictures were in chronological order, the couple became more recognizable as Harper browsed through them. But they weren’t the only ones Harper began to recognize. The glimpse of one of their daughters as a young woman made Harper come to a complete stop and fail to catch his breath. Without any doubt whatsoever, Harper knew the young woman in the picture was Megan. He remembered her saying that she would bring her victims to that cabin since her family no longer used it, but that didn’t necessarily mean her parents knew what she now used it for. It’s possible they unknowingly provided her the ideal hunting grounds for her monster counterpart. But then Harper remembered there wasn’t a vehicle outside of the cabin and the image of the buggy outside flashed in his mind. Her parents definitely knew and they were helping her and if that’s the case, why were they helping the ones that got away? That’s when a sudden fatigue set in and a cold sweat overtook Harper’s body. He turned around as his legs became jello and saw the unconscious bodies of Naomi and Olivia. Harper’s legs gave out underneath him as he brought out the utility knife.

I'm not sure if this would affect it or not but they insisted on doing a random glucose test instead of a fasting one, because I had 3 sips of black coffee about 15 minutes before my bloodwork, just try to keep the caffeine withdrawal headache away.

Anyway, I'm most definitely going to work towards some lifestyle changes that hopefully I can stick with, namely exercising more than the none I do now, and decreasing red meat, dairy, and alcohol - none of which are off the charts but more than they should be and certainly any decrease is going to be good for me regardless of cholesterol.

In the meantime I would also like to take psyllium, flax, or chia as I need more fiber, no doubt. About 6 months ago I tried a ""flavorless"" (yah right!) generic psyllium powder but I couldn't find any way to take it that didn't make me want to vomit and I threw it out.

Ideally I would like something that would dissolve nicely in coffee since I drink it daily and it would be a good way to remember and be in a routine. But that may not exist. I despise oatmeal and not a huge fan of yogurt (edit: or smoothies) so adding to those is not going to happen. On weekdays I generally eat a slice of whole wheat toast with a slice of cheese (that I suppose I should try to reduce or replace with...nut butter maybe?) Lunch and dinner vary wildly depending on what's going on in life.

What's my best plan of attack here? I'm trying to be realistic...any crazy changes are probably not sustainable. Thanks!",1,1761843287.0,Cholesterol,7,1.0,False

***

**Started Pickleball After 50: Regret Ignoring This Tip for 6 Months! 🎾**

Alright, friends, let's talk pickleball. I know, I know, you're probably picturing those sporty retirees owning the courts. But hear me out!

I finally caved and tried it six months ago. And honestly? I'm kicking myself for not starting sooner. It's ridiculously fun, gets you moving, and is way more social than I ever expected. BUT... there's one thing I totally overlooked at first, and it set me back BIG TIME.

Ready for it?

*   **Warm Up Properly.** Seriously. Don't be like me. I jumped right in, thinking, ""Hey, I'm still kinda flexible!"" Nope. Pulled a muscle in my shoulder during a particularly enthusiastic serve. Spent the next week feeling like a pretzel someone tried to untwist.

*   **Start with Lessons.** I thought I could just wing it. I mean, it’s just hitting a wiffle ball over a net, right? WRONG. A little instruction goes a long way. Correct technique not only prevents injuries (see point #1), but also helps you actually *enjoy* the game. It's the quickest way to get better and avoid developing bad habits.

*   **Invest in Decent Shoes.** This one seems obvious, but I initially wore my old sneakers. Big mistake. My feet were killing me after an hour. Pickleball involves a lot of quick lateral movements, so you need shoes with good support and grip. Trust me, your feet (and knees) will thank you.

*   **Find Your Tribe.** Pickleball communities are incredibly welcoming. Don't be afraid to join a local group or league. It's a fantastic way to meet new people, stay motivated, and improve your game. Plus, post-game coffee and chats are the best!

So, what was the tip I regret ignoring? It's the warm up! It took me that injury to realise its crucial. Now I follow a consistent routine that includes stretching and light cardio before I even think about stepping on the court. And while we believe in strongest people, even they need warm ups. Check out this link for some tips: [We believe in strongest people.](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb)

I’m curious, has anyone else had a similar experience starting a new activity later in life? What did *you* wish you knew beforehand? Maybe something I missed? What's your favorite way to stay active?
I'd love to hear what you think!

Hey everyone! My name is a Olivia, a dancer working in marketing. I am an NYC transplant from Connecticut, and I have lived in this apartment for 2 years, planning a new beginning elsewhere with my partner. Otherwise, I would stay!!

This is an opportunity for a lease takeover in December, but one of the bedrooms is actually available to start off your move for November!! 
I am prioritizing people who can cover the room before taking over the full lease, as my roommate is moving out before me. 

There is also an option to renew on September 30th, 2026.

Some specs about the apartment:

• Very quiet, tree lined street a couple minute walk from the park 

• True 2 - Bed same size bedrooms (no flex walls) fits double bed or queen 

• Common living area

• Separate generously sized kitchen with new fridge, stovetop & microwave (windowed)

• Windowed bathroom with a soaking tub

• On the first floor of a walk - up. Chill live in super.

• Right by McGolrick park, and less than a 10 minute walk to McCarren Park. Easy access to Nassau Avenue G - train, under 15 minute walk from Bedford Avenue L - train.

• Bodegas border the apartment on either side. Met Food Supermarket & Susan Laundromat around the corner.

• Neighborhood favorites Diamond Slice & Variety Coffee a stone's throw away.

Disclaimer: The apartment is lived in, so personal items have been removed using Meta Ai

The full apartment rents at $3650 (Heat Included!). So the one bedroom in November is just 1825. 

I am responsive to texts for video and/or in-person tours for those that are serious about moving forward, and once we have that sorted, I am happy to send an application to the right person/people. Looking forward to meeting you, go ahead and text me at

👉 **The app is completely free, with all core features unlocked.**

✅ Edit every log down to the gram  
✅ Everything you see in the app right now is included — no codes, no subscriptions, no catch.

Later, after we reach 2,000 users, I’ll start adding **optional premium features** like deeper analytics, but that’s something planned **after reaching 2,000 users and not the same as the base features you are seeing here.**

So I have the Delonghi Dedica EC685 and I just added a Rancillo steam wand as an upgrade which has been good for frothing milk. 

I am now considering buying the sage dose control/dose control pro for grinding directly into my portafilter. I am conscious that I have a 51mm portafilter and sage is normally 54mm.

I can see this typically costs 200 euros and I can get a Sage Barista express for 500 euros that would already have a built in grinder and perhaps a better steam wand than what I have? Maybe better output of coffee through a better machine than Delonghi anyway? 

I’m not opposed to spending the 500 on the sage barista express but if the main value that’s missing between my delonghi and the sage is the grinder then maybe I’m better off buying the sage smart dose control?

I found it to be helpful- and was wondering if anyone else had effective illustrations they've come up with to explain how their condition affects them to family/friends/colleagues. Here is one I came up with, based on a game I'd play with friends back in highschool during study hall. I called it ""The Wikipedia game"" (not sure if it's an actual game or not, but we came up with it because our school computers didn't have games on them). The goal of the game was simple, to think of a specific topic that you want to arrive at (like Coco Cola as an example) and press the ""random article"" button. Whatever your starting point is, you can only use the blue hyperlinks in the article to move forward. So in mid conversation if someone is asking why on earth I'm bringing up coca cola when we were talking about Columbia, it's because Columbia>Coffee Bean>Coffee>Caffeinated Beverage>Soda>Coca Cola :)

It's especially helpful if they have a smartphone or computer handy to have them actually do this exercise, as sometimes the connections come easy, and sometimes they end up frustrated and lost.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1ok4rmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/metalworking/comments/1ok4rmr/reposting_my_steel_dock_railing_project_as/,Reposting my Steel dock railing project as pictures didn't properly load.,"Had finished this project before harvest but been busy operating combine for weeks now. This was something simple that my dad & mom worked out. Using 1 x 3 11 gauge rectangle tubing for most of the structure. The inner rectangles are 1/2 square tube 13 gauge steel. The Sun Moon and Star are 1/2 inch solid square stock.

The benches are also 1 x 3 11 ga. rectangle bolted to the dock and to the railings for strength. I went with this ""odd"" size to work with the 2 x 6's being used for the seats & back of benches and to have that perfect size for setting a hot coffee or cold beer atop of. Everything is powder coated black. The lumber will be rubber coated but dad hasn't decided on the color he wants yet.

Give me your honest opinions. Most of my work is agriculture welding repair and lawn ornaments/sculpture. I used to do work for cattlemen on custom sized continuous pipe fencing/corrals as well but that work was too hard on my back. I started out welding two decades ago to build nitrogen application farm implements (Anhydrous, liquid nitrogen and dry fertilizer applicators) and stopped a decade ago, loved working heavy metal but became injured and nursing disability because of it. Be kind if you can.

Whether visiting for business, leisure, or a deeper exploration of art and history, a [hotel stay in Kolkata](https://hotelkzarcorporate.com/) offers more than just accommodation—it’s an experience of the city’s heart and soul. From heritage neighborhoods filled with nostalgic architecture to bustling city centers alive with energy, every stay here is a journey through time and tradition.

[hotel stay in kolkata](https://preview.redd.it/8z0w8udz1ayf1.png?width=1495&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d56ba54c48174c7111dd852bafb9ae5dc0f850e)

# A City That Blends Heritage with Modernity

Kolkata’s hospitality landscape beautifully mirrors its personality—a city where vintage elegance coexists with contemporary comforts. Many hotels are housed in colonial-era buildings that retain their old-world charm, with grand facades, wooden staircases, and art-laden corridors. At the same time, modern hotels showcase sleek architecture, high-end amenities, and global standards of service. This blend of past and present ensures that travelers find options to suit every preference and budget, from cozy homestays to luxury suites.

# Ideal Locations for Every Type of Traveler

The choice of where to stay in Kolkata depends largely on the purpose of your visit.

* **Central Kolkata (Park Street, Esplanade, and Dalhousie):** Ideal for first-time visitors and business travelers. The area is rich in colonial architecture, vibrant restaurants, and shopping arcades.
* **South Kolkata (Ballygunge, Gariahat, and Tollygunge):** Known for its residential serenity and cultural charm, this region offers boutique accommodations perfect for long stays and family vacations.
* **Salt Lake and New Town:** These modern neighborhoods are hubs for corporate travelers, with numerous business hotels, tech parks, and convention centers nearby.
* **North Kolkata (Shyambazar, Sovabazar, and College Street):** For those drawn to heritage, literature, and tradition, North Kolkata offers old mansions turned into guesthouses, giving an authentic taste of Bengal’s past.

Each area provides a distinct experience—be it the bustling nightlife of Park Street, the tranquility of South Kolkata, or the intellectual buzz of College Street.

# Comfort and Convenience: What to Expect

Kolkata’s hospitality industry caters to a wide spectrum of needs. Standard amenities across hotels generally include complimentary Wi-Fi, air conditioning, 24-hour room service, and secure parking. Higher-end accommodations may also feature rooftop lounges, in-house spas, fitness centers, and conference halls. Many hotels now prioritize eco-friendly practices, offering energy-efficient rooms, organic toiletries, and locally sourced food options.

Service in Kolkata is marked by warmth and attention to detail, reflecting the city’s cultural ethos of treating guests as family. Whether it’s an early morning wake-up tea or assistance in arranging local tours, the staff often go the extra mile to ensure a comfortable stay.

# Culinary Delights Await

No trip to Kolkata is complete without savoring its diverse cuisine, and most hotels understand this well. Buffets typically feature a mix of traditional Bengali dishes—like fish curry, luchi with aloo dum, and mishti doi—alongside continental, North Indian, and Chinese specialties. Rooftop and garden restaurants in some hotels provide an enchanting ambiance for dinner, often accompanied by live music or panoramic city views.

For those keen to explore outside the hotel, Kolkata’s street food scene—filled with puchkas, kathi rolls, and jhal muri—is just a walk away from most major stay areas.

# Nearby Attractions and Experiences

Staying in Kolkata offers easy access to some of India’s most iconic landmarks. Within short distances from most hotels, visitors can explore:

* **Victoria Memorial:** A majestic marble monument surrounded by gardens and history.
* **Howrah Bridge:** An engineering marvel and one of the busiest cantilever bridges in the world.
* **Indian Museum:** The oldest museum in Asia, filled with ancient artifacts and art.
* **Kalighat Temple:** One of the most revered Shakti Peethas in India.
* **Park Street:** Known for its lively nightlife, colonial cafes, and festive illumination during Christmas and New Year.

Cultural enthusiasts can also enjoy theater performances at Academy of Fine Arts, attend poetry readings at Coffee House, or shop for traditional handlooms at Dakshinapan.

# Choosing the Right Stay

When planning your visit, it’s wise to consider the duration of your stay, the purpose of travel, and proximity to your areas of interest. Travelers looking for immersive local experiences might prefer heritage guesthouses, while business professionals may opt for well-equipped hotels in Salt Lake or New Town. Always check guest reviews, transportation accessibility, and safety measures before finalizing a booking.

# A Stay to Remember

Kolkata’s hotels reflect the city’s enduring warmth and grace. From waking up to the sound of tram bells and morning prayers to returning after a day of exploration to a comforting Bengali meal, every moment adds to the charm of your stay. The city’s welcoming spirit, coupled with a well-rounded hospitality sector, ensures that travelers leave not just with memories of places, but of people and stories that linger long after the journey ends.

In essence, a visit to Kolkata isn’t merely about sightseeing—it’s about feeling at home in a city that greets you with open arms and timeless character.",1,1761842426.0,u_Simple-Spinach-3967,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

I can't believe I have to write this post so early (usually I would wait until like, December) but we're already seeing people get early callbacks on the database so I feel like now might be the time just to make sure the extra early folks have all the guides they need that might help. 

**So let's get to it!**

As you know, callbacks are starting to roll out at early firms, both for 1L recruiting and in some cases, even 2L.   
  
If this is your first callback season, here’s a full breakdown of what to expect, how to prepare, and what actually moves the needle. If you want a little more after this post, I created a big law interview prep guide (with basically every question a firm could ask you, recommended answers, and recommended answer structures)-- feel free to DM if that's helpful. 

# What a Callback Is (and Isn’t)

A **callback** is the next step after your initial screener.  
  
If you’ve received one, the firm already liked your resume and stats, and now they want to really evaluate *fit*.

**At this stage:**

* You’ve cleared the academic and resume hurdle. So things like your school rank (and GPA when you get it), have passed whatever minimum marker the firm needs. 
* The callback is about **chemistry, communication, and consistency**.
* Firms (and more specifically the attorneys making the hiring decisions) are deciding: *would we want to spend thousands of hours a year working with you?*
   * Firms use callbacks to assess your skills (at least, ostensibly, because yes, they’re very very green), but most importantly, your personality and overall fit for their specific *firm, office,* and even possibly *practice groups*. 
   * Culture can be wildly different at each firm, at each office, and at each practice group, so this is their chance to see if you fit in, but also your chance to see if you fit in. 

# Typical Structure

Most callbacks include:

* Between 3–5 interviews, usually one on one with attorneys, about 30ish minutes each. So you should expect usually around 2 (or for some of the intense firms, upwards of 3+ hours of interviewing back to back).
   * Cons to this: it is exceedingly draining for many people. 
   * Pros to this: you get really good at pitching yourself because you just get to practice that interview muscle a ton by default. 
* A mix of partners, senior associates, and junior associates.
* **More Than Just a Q&A:** These interviews are (ideally) conversational but remember that you want to be strategic. In fact, oftentimes there’s an actual list that interviewers have to fill out after the interview to judge each candidate. There’s a post on that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1fazayu/a_guide_what_interviewers_at_a_firm_judge_a/) actually if you’re curious what they’re looking at.
   * Since every law student is essentially a fresh slate in terms of skills to a firm, as you talk and bring up your work experience/answer questions/weave that into the conversation, you’ll want to specifically emphasize *research, writing,* and *analysis.* 
   * Those are your number 1 value adds as an associate, and you want to show up front that those are skills you either learned in law school (maybe through legal writing, etc), learned through your 1L summer experience, or learned through your prior work experience in a way that makes your prior experience a clear transferable skill set. 
* Also, realistically, callbacks are also a chance for the firm to show off a bit. They want to impress you with their culture, work, and people just as much as you want to impress them, so just keep in mind that any answers you get to any questions you might have will probably have a bit of a rose colored tint to them, so take them with a grain of salt. 
* Most are still virtual, though it'll depend on the firm (i.e. Morgan Lewis in NY does many in-person).

# The Timeline

The callback process moves fast, but the exact timing can vary by firm, and even by region (i.e. primary markets like the New York market move super fast, but secondary markets like Atlanta can move slower). As always, you can check out the [database](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1jsztlb/the_big_law_offer_and_timeline_tracker_a_database/) for exact timing on firms from both last year and live updates this year. 

Here’s what to expect:

1. **After the Screener:**
   * If a firm likes you, you’ll usually hear back within 1-7 days to schedule a callback. Some firms may even contact you the same day if they’re quick to the punch.
2. **After the Callback:**
   * Offers can come as quickly as the same day or take up to a couple of weeks. Firms are often juggling multiple candidates, so don’t panic if it takes a little time.
   * Additionally, if you haven’t heard back in a while, sometimes it might be the case that you are the second string pick and the firm is waiting to hear a response from their first pick. 
   * For example, I had one firm that took nearly 5 weeks to get back to me with an offer, which usually meant their first choice candidate declined the offer, so they were looking at the other candidates that were close calls.
   * Either way, no need to waste a good worry. Once you complete the callback, focus your attention on the things you can control–your next application or interview, and hope for the best. 

# The Structure of a Callback

Especially if you happen to have some in person, they can take up to the better part of a day once you include commute time, waiting in lobbies, interviewers moving around, and all that jazz. That said, many of these still take place on Zoom which gives you a bit more control and comfort to play the game at least on your home turf.

Here’s what a typical callback day looks like:

1. **Intro with Recruiting:**
   * You’ll often (but not always) start with a quick meeting with the legal recruiting coordinator/HR person. They’ll give you the schedule and answer any logistical questions before the interviews begin.
2. **Attorney Interviews:**
   * You’ll usually meet with attorneys one on one (sometimes in pairs), and there will be around 3-6 attorneys. This will be a mix of associates and partners.
      * This is purely anecdotal, I did notice that these often started off with more junior folks first and your later interviews were often the more senior folks like partners and Of Counsel. Either way, you’ll usually get a list of who your interviewers are before the big day, so you can do your research and see who you’re talking to. 
   * **The tone can vary:** Some interviews are casual and conversational and sometimes barely talking about school or work experience, while others might feel more formal with canned questions like “tell me about a time you XYZ”
      1. **Sometimes you’ll get a bad interviewer. That’s okay. Don’t freak out. It happens:** Every blue moon you might get an interviewer who is either too tired/too busy/just a jerk/or got pulled in last minute to do the interview. Sometimes, that person will have literally zero questions for you and basically start off the interview by just asking “what can I tell you about the firm?” 
      2. Personally these are a big turn off for me for a firm since as an interviewee, I’m also judging culture fit, but it happens. 
      3. Don’t worry though. Just make sure you have questions lined up and gear up to take a driver's seat for the conversation. If you need a couple go to questions that show that you did your homework on the firm, there’s a post about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1fazahq/questions_to_ask_in_an_ociscreenercallback/). 
   * **Topics:** Generally, you’ll discuss your background, interest in the firm (*definitely* make sure you have a “Why this firm” answer ready to go in your back pocket, and possibly answer a couple of behavioral questions (e.g., “Tell me about a time you overcame a challenge”). But more often than not, I find most folks will briefly scan your resume, look for something that pops out, and just start asking some genuine questions about that (or just start asking you questions after you answer the standard “tell me about yourself” question). 
   * For example, maybe you had an interesting first career before you lateraled to law, or maybe you’re super involved with some clubs, or whatever. 
3. **Lunch or Coffee (Optional):**
   * Some firms, if they’re doing an in person interview, can include a meal or coffee chat with junior associates after the interviews. 
   * Remember, though this is more relaxed than an interview, it’s still part of the evaluation—stay professional, engaged, ask questions. (I promise you, every single year there is some story about a kid who decided that this was the time to order hard liquor at lunch or something silly and it never ends well, so just make sure you still treat it like an interview/evaluation until you’re out the door and on your way home.)

# How to Prepare

1. **Research the Firm:**
   * Do your first level google/deep dive into the firm’s website. Brownie points if you happen to catch any positive recent news/major cases/deals and weave them naturally into the conversation, i.e. “I’m interested in X practice area and I am really intrigued by the firm's publication/latest case on X that I just read about.” 
      1. You don’t need to be an expert or spend a ton of time on this, but it’s always a good idea to show you know about their world and can speak competently about it generally, even without being an expert or attorney yet. 
   * **Key research point:** Know their practice areas. We’ve seen a lot of folks go into an interview, who are wonderful and well spoken candidates, but who clearly didn’t do any research and say something like “I’m interested in X practice” and then the attorney has to awkwardly say “Welp. We don’t have X practice. Sooooo…” It’s awkward and a pretty easy way to turn a candidacy into an immediate no, so just make sure you know what the firm does, and you don’t say something else. (You can find this a lot of places, like Scout, firm websites, Chambers, etc.)
2. **Practice Your Answers:**
   * As I mentioned above, be ready to discuss your resume, why you’re interested in the firm, and “tell me about yourself.” Those are by far the most common questions you’ll be asked first, so you’ll want tight and focused answers for each. 
      1. I recommend checking out something like the [STAR method](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method), that just helps you focus your answers and tidy them up with nice clean endings (if you’re like me and long winded, I find this helps give them structure so you don’t ramble in interviews).
   * Think about behavioral questions you might be asked (e.g., about teamwork, problem-solving when there was no answer, etc.) and prepare concise answers. 
      1. If you need a callback interview prep document with a list of the most common big law interview questions, I’ve made one that I’m happy to share. Feel free to DM if you want it. 
   * Lastly, of course, take a second to practice a couple answers and cover a couple bullet points with yourself or a friend, but no need to over-rehearse either. The more canned your answers sound, the less conversational the flow of the interview will be. 
      1. My personal trick to this is that I will bullet point a couple of key stories in my notes and key points in those stories I might want to hit if I end up bringing them up, but I won’t write out word for word what I want to say. That way, it gives me a little breathing room to talk about the story in a natural way, as opposed to feeling like I should read directly off my notes. 
3. **Prepare Questions:**
   * This is not just a chance for you to vet the firm, but remember, your questions are still a chance to show something of value—that you’ve done your homework and are (ostensibly) genuinely interested in the people and culture of the firm. 
   * Again, here’s a [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1fazahq/questions_to_ask_in_an_ociscreenercallback/) with a couple questions that show you did your homework and aren’t treating this interview as 1 of 1000 similar interviews (even though it might very well be).

# After the Callback

1. **Send Thank-You Emails:**
   * It’s debatable how much these actually will sway anyone's opinion ultimately, but I’m personally of the school that it never hurts, so give it a shot. They don’t have to be long, and—pro tip: if you jot down a brief note after/during the interview about something you talked about, you’ll be able to more easily write a bit of a personalized thank-you email to each attorney you met.
   * For example, you can simply say “Hello XYZ, Thank you so much for your time in the interview today. Our conversation about X really helped me evaluate the firm/my practice areas of interest/my career/whatever. I am grateful for all your time and insight. I look forward to hearing from the team. Best, XYZ”
   * Bam. Short, professional, personal, and gives you one more positive touch point opportunity with that interviewer. 
2. **Be Patient:**
   * Waiting for an offer can be nerve-wracking and really it should be considered a 10th circle of hell, but just try to remember that firms are juggling a lot of candidates. If it’s been more than two weeks, it’s okay to politely follow up with the recruiter. 
   * Pro tip: If there are any updates to your application, that is an easy way to wiggle in a follow up poke too. You can simply say “Hi Recruiter X, I have XYZ update to my application (i.e. maybe new grades, resume updates, whatever). Let me know how the application process is going and if there is anything else I can provide the team. Thank you.”
3. **Compare Offers:**
   * I’m going to manifest here and say you’re all going to get multiple offers, okay? In that case, here’s a [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1eb23o3/a_guide_on_how_to_compare_offers_from_firms_after/) that can help you weigh your options, compare between offers, and get really in the weeds on how to tell these firms apart.

### Background
I started to run more consistently in 2020 and slowly increased my mileage over the next few years (2020: 910km; 2021: 1293km; 2022: 1581km; 2023: 2285km). I ran 3:35:44 in my first marathon (Brighton 2022) where I injured myself and jog/walked the final 5-6 kilometres. Despite this, I wanted to pursue longer distances so I then trained for and ran two trail ultras (50km in September 2022; 75km in April 2024). Following this, I decided to focus on the shorter distances as I’d always wanted to run a sub-20 5k. From Aug 2024 to Mar 2025, I followed a JD 5k-10k block and then a Pfitz HM 12/47-63 block. Averaging 45 miles (~70km) per week, I raced several times ending up with PRs of: 5k 18:38 (Dec 2024); 10k 38:39 (Feb 2025 as a tune-up); and HM 1:25:45 (Mar 2025).

Following my HM PR, I thought I could give a sub-3h marathon a good go so I signed up to Frankfurt about a week later. Prior to starting marathon-specific training, I built some speed through a shortened 5k Pfitz block, culminating in a 5k PR of 18:08 on the Sunday exactly 18 weeks before the marathon.

### Training
I decided to try follow something in-between the Pfitz 18/55 and the Pfitz 18/70 plans. I ran the harder quality sessions from the 18/70, but was flexible with mileage and running more easily when it felt warranted. I often broken down the threshold runs into shorter intervals, and also changed a few workouts to sub-threshold style intervals, especially in the latter stages where I thought a greater volume of threshold work would be more beneficial than some vo2max efforts. MP sessions never felt particularly easy but I managed to hit the desired pace (4’15min/km or below), also adding an extra MP run in week 15. 

Overall, training went largely smoothly. I felt some fatigue in weeks 4 and 5 so took these as mild recovery weeks. In week 9, I trialled out the Adios Pro 4 in my MP long run, which lead to an aggravated Achilles. It was definitely foolish to try them straight into that taxing session so lesson learnt. I took 4 days off and also opted out of a tune-up 5k race, but managed to ease back into running. In the following weeks, I blew up in a 5k parkrun hoping to ambitiously run sub18 despite not so fresh legs. Thankfully a couple weeks later, I PR’d my 10k tune-up (38’11) with minimal taper which brought back some confidence. 

In week 16, I had a slight health scare as I experienced paraesthesia across the right side of my body from head to toe. This prompted a visit to the ED where I was able to rule out some of the potentially more serious neurological causes. In any case, that was very much a spanner in the works, and I wasn’t entirely sure what it would mean for my race. The next couple weeks felt fine given the reduced volume during the taper, but I did experience further paraesthesia on/off closer to my right hip and lower body (perhaps hinting at piriformis syndrome), which wasn’t painful per se but remained a concern. 

For those interested, I used the following shoes: Adizero SL2 and Superblast 2 (easy and long runs without MP); Takumi Sen 10 (threshold / vo2max / 2 long runs with MP / tune-up races); and Adios Pro 4 (3 long runs with MP / race day). 

I ended up averaging 92km (57 miles) across the first 15 weeks (before the taper), peaking at 110km (69 miles). Below is an overview of the key sessions and paces:

### Pre-race
With a few days to go, my legs weren’t feeling great, my heart rate was quite elevated compared to usual, and I was feeling slightly under the weather but I ascribed these all to taper tantrums (or being in my head). We arrived in Frankfurt two days prior on the Friday. My partner who kindly travelled with me, was rather unwell, so I decided to stay in another hotel to minimise the risk of catching anything worse. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, my sleep was pretty poor and broken for several days in a row, and this cumulatively had its toll on the Saturday where my legs were in a lot of pain simply existing. Walking to the expo to pick up my bib was quite difficult, and I was quite upset as I thought I had hindered any chance at running a good race / hitting sub 3. Despite the taper, my legs were feeling worse than at any point throughout the training block. This was quite mentally challenging, but I decided that I would just give tomorrow a good go. In terms of carb loading, I aimed for about 8-10g/kg on the Saturday, getting them mostly in before my evening meal.

### Race
Morning of the race, I’d slept pretty poorly as expected given race day, and had my breakfast (apple juice; two pieces of toast and some jam; coffee) three hours before the race start. Conditions were great (5-7C) with some wind and thankfully no rain. I dropped off my bag at the expo, and jogged for about ten minutes and did some dynamic stretches as a warm-up before entering the pen. 

For nutrition, I took six Sis Beta gels (40g carbs; some electrolytes) as planned at: -15 minutes; 6k; 13k; 20k; 27.5k; and 35k. I carried a handheld 500ml bottle for the first hour to avoid any congestion at the earlier water stations.

I placed myself towards the back end of the sub 3:00 pen as I had little desire to go any faster than goal pace. In hindsight, I should have placed myself further up as I’d lost about 30 seconds in the first couple kilometres from congestion - but maybe that was a decent way to warm-up. I decided to run off feel, though I did check my time every few km marker to make sure I was loosely on pace, and was pleased to see that I had settled pretty much on a couple seconds quicker than my goal MP pace of 4’15/k.

My Achilles started to hurt around the 7km mark but thankfully quieted down, and the next hour and half was relatively uneventful. I split the first half in 1:28:39 - a tad faster than I had planned but not too aggressive so just kept at it. I knew the real challenge was coming up in the last 10km, and the wheels started to come off then. I had a stitch at 32km which went away, but then different parts of my body cumulatively started to hurt. I slowed down from 34km to 40km (4’21, 4’32, 4’26, 4’31, 4’43, 4’33), and for every kilometre split here, I was just calculating the pace I needed to creep under sub 3. This was ~4’35/k – and this kept relatively constant meaning that I couldn’t slow down any further, which was a scary thought. All I could think was that it might have been easier (rightly or wrongly) without the unfortunate circumstances of poor sleep/recovery, whilst acknowledging nothing is guaranteed in this distance. Nonetheless, I managed to pull through with two kilometres from 40km to 42km at 4’15/k, though it was only once I could see the finish that I was able to relax and enjoy the final stretch.

### Post-race
I felt emotionally and physically shattered, and still couldn’t quite believe I had made it. I do find it quite funny how one goes from running at a decent clip to hobbling around immediately on crossing the finish line. A lot of joy, tears, disbelief, and pain (hah) – and it was great to be able to share those emotions with my partner without whose support I wouldn’t have made it through months of training and to my goal.

After a couple weeks off, I think I’ll go back to focussing on the 5k-HM distances as I want a bit of a break from the marathon. A sub 1:20 HM (or the equivalent in the 5k and 10k) might be a nice target for some time in 2026. Not sure if that’s too ambitious but I’d like to hit that first before considering another marathon. I definitely won’t be hitting another 37-minute PR though!

If I post it anywhere on Reddit the master hackers (guilty members of htb in my honest but humble opinion) convince mods to take it down! It’s fact, not fiction! That criminal needs to go to jail!","I joined hack the box and had an argument with Harris Pylarinos. I was about to hit hacker status and I seen a reverse tunnel coming into my machine via my openvpn terminal. He went through my browsing history and accused me of cheating because I googled a thing or two about hacking. I was trying to reach hacker status on his site and was about there. I was injecting an ssh key into a user’s home directory from a temporary directory on the machine and come to find out Harris was sitting in the virtual machine deleting the key I injected stopping me from reaching hacker status and joining a team.

Come to find out he installed a keylogger in my computer and took over all my online accounts and any new one I created! I was also locked out of one of my computers and a phone.

My ex was cheating at the time and was seeing her ex husband who has it bad for me. He found out about this and reached out to Harris and they formed a criminal organization with a group of collection agents from work. These losers all do open relationships.

So they slip one of the girls from the collection agency into my life who played the loving and loyal girlfriend while betraying me the entire time. She had the keys to my apartment while driving my car and made copies while I was at work. She gave Harris’s criminal organization access to my apartment and set it up for cyber attacks. Gave Harris access points at her house and my apartment and the games begin.

He hacked 3 computers of mine overwriting my passwd using using openssl -6 salt newuser newpasswd command and editing my /etc/passwd file and then overwriting my original file locking me out of my computer!

He flashed my Bluetooth speaker and turned it into a listening device. The device name was now bt-99 which returned a headset firmware with a Google search.

He ran Bluesnarfer attacks and locked me out of 3 brand new iPhones. He intercepted emails to my car insurance provider stopping me from verifying my identity. My car insurance was dropped forcing my car off the road.

Fraudulent charges on my bank card from the United Kingdom locking my bank account forcing me to have to go into the bank to unlock my account 3 different times. Green dot credit cards were purchased and the money would go lost in cyber space with no explanation from the credit card company. Had to wait for a check via snail mail for a refund 4 weeks later.

My cell phone bill was due and my phone was supposed to be off yet it could still dial out to the woman who gave them access to do all of this? My apartment was watched and his criminal organization gained access while I wasn’t home and fentanyl was put in my coffee in an attempt to kill me.

I have police reports filled everywhere. See more at r/Hackedvictims  Harris is a cyber criminal and a killer. This man should be behind bars and never allowed access to a computer. His group of cyber criminals r/masterhackers are all over my subreddit trying to say I have mental health issues and this never happened. I assure you that all of this happened

I will continue on letting everyone know he is a cyber criminal! He can’t do anything more to me than he already has! It takes a hacker to catch a hacker!

I’m 20 f now but when i started struggling with attention in school I went to the doctors for adhd meds at 9 years old. The doctor proceeded to tell me that i’m too “high functioning” in school to need medication because my grades were great. I only couldn’t stop talking out of turn and never wanted to sit. The behavior problems didn’t stop and I started hating school. When i was 10 years old my mom let me start coffee to help get me up and ready for school. I’ve been drinking coffee everyday since then until recently. It’s only been a week without coffee and my body is more energetic than ever. Around 13 i started getting physically depressed and not expressing myself of commuting at all. I thought it was just MDD major depressive disorder and GAD generalized anxiety disorder (what they diagnosed me with) and started antidepressants. I’ll just say my parents paid their dues for about 7 years of me being miserable and sharing the favor. At 18 i was hospitalized in a mental health facility and finally diagnosed with adhd. I try not to think that it could’ve all been avoided if i’d been diagnosed sooner. I remember being a kid and struck by the audacity of him saying i cant be adhd cause i’m too smart. It didn’t even feel like a compliment. Anyways, the train of thought left the station. I’m not on any adhd medication or coffee right now and it’s actually better than when i only drank coffee. I have way less anxiety and shakes (yes i shake sometimes after coffee) but the only downside is the withdrawal. Headaches have been killinnggg me I almost had a cup of coffee today to get rid of it. Now’s time for the question.  

Does anyone have a similar experience or have any opinions on what can help adhd?

We’ve been back together for a few years, but we actually dated when we were 17 and 18. It always felt like unfinished business, and we would randomly reach out over the years. After both of our divorces, we found each other again, and it honestly felt like fate gave us another chance. When things were good, they were really good. We could talk for hours, laugh over the dumbest things, and we’re aligned on a lot of the important stuff. I also know we truly care for each other.

But over time her triggers have gotten worse. I journal a lot and have written about many of our hard moments, and lately those moments have been happening more often. About six months ago she was arrested after an argument, and her ex used that situation to take her kids away. She hasn’t seen them since, and that loss has crushed her while likely fueling the intensity of things between us too.

Then in September there was an incident while my own kids were at the house. Chairs and plates were thrown, and after that I made sure my boys weren’t around when things felt unstable. When I have them, I would stay at my parents instead. That was when I drew a line and told her that for us to keep trying, she needed to be in consistent therapy. She did start an intensive program and was diagnosed with complex PTSD from her previous abusive marriage of 17 years.

Even with that, it’s been hard. I’ve got two little boys from my first marriage, and it’s started feeling like I’m always trying to keep peace in two places at once. This week, things escalated again when I was leaving to see my kids. She panicked, begged me not to go, and her abandonment trigger took over. It got bad enough that I called 911. An emergency protective order was filed and she was arrested. Since then, I haven’t seen or spoken to her. Up until that night, we were still living together and I truly thought we were trying to make it work. It’s been a shock.

Even though I know it’s taking a toll on me emotionally, I’ve always tried to stand by her and help her through the hardest moments because I know what’s underneath all that fear. This wasn’t the first time things went too far. Arguments can turn destructive, and then later when we would discuss it, the situations would get minimized and lowered from what actually took place, that for me, It makes it hard to heal. Sometimes she’ll say something different later that doesn’t match what’s on our cameras or recordings, and it leaves me confused, wondering if I’m being too sensitive, which I think about most nights.

She’s never really been alone. She married young, went straight from that into our relationship, and since her ex restricted her time with her kids, she’s lost almost everything that gave her stability. I helped her get legal help, stood by her after her earlier arrest, and did everything I could to be in her corner. Now I’m sitting in peace at home and she’s alone in a hotel, and I feel guilty about it.

During the last incident this week after I had already called 911, she was so terrified of getting in trouble again that she said something about telling the police a version of events that wasn’t true which would have made me the aggressor. When I reminded her about the cameras and audio, she broke down and apologized, saying she was just desperate in the moment. That scared me because it showed how far her fear can push her.

My lawyer wants to move forward, serve the divorce at her work, and try to extend the order past the 91 days. I keep hesitating because my heart hasn’t caught up to all of this. Part of me believes that if we both do the work, maybe one day we could try again. But I’m scared that if I take that space, I’ll lose her completely. I’m also scared that if I don’t, I’ll keep putting her healing above mine and my kids’. I know the depth and complexity of who she is at her core, and I believe the chaos comes from the damage left behind by her past. But trying to help her remove all that pain has made me completely lose myself.

I’ve been seeing a therapist for a few months now, and she believes I’m trauma bonded after years of these emotional highs and lows. I can see the pattern and I’m trying to be honest about it, but it doesn’t make the feelings stop. I miss her even through all the pain, and then I get these waves of calm at home that feel like peace, and I don’t know what to do with that.

One of the hardest parts of this is the protective order and knowing that the legal side could affect her job and her ability to see her kids. I don’t want that for her. In a perfect world, I wish I could just tell her we both need a year apart, I’d focus on therapy and my boys, she could keep healing and rebuilding, and maybe we could meet again one day for coffee, healthier versions of ourselves. But I don’t know if that’s realistic.  If I don’t drop the charges against her though, she will lose her job, likely lose her kids even more and truly have nothing.  I can’t be the one to do that to her when I see past the outside destruction.

My questions:

1.	How do I let go of someone I still care about when the relationship has gotten this unstable?

2.	How do I handle the guilt of knowing she’s alone and struggling when I’m the one in our home and she’s in a hotel?

3.	Is it realistic to hold on to the idea of maybe trying again later if we both actually heal, or am I just keeping myself stuck?

TL;DR: 41M, partner 39F. Long history and strong bond, but her triggers and escalations led to an incident where I called 911 and an emergency protective order was filed. My lawyer wants to finalize and extend the order. I still love and worry about her but I also want peace and to protect my kids. How do I move forward without feeling like I’m abandoning her, and is it realistic to hope for a later reconnection?

1ok4diw,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1ok4diw/control_is_abuse/,Control IS abuse.,"I just broke up with my ex a few days ago. I knew for a while I was being abused, but I stayed. I stayed because he would cry. Because he would pull on my heart strings and I would eventually say sorry for my part of the situation. Some things he did:

-Coerced me into having sex by saying it has been x amount of days since we had any and he needs to feel desired in that way.

-Punched and broke my car radio in a fit of anger.

-Gave me herpes and didn’t even say sorry. It was some of the worst pain I ever felt and he made sure to say something about how I wasn’t meeting his sexual needs during that time.

-Did not work the entire 2 years we were together except some I.T. consultant work and the money went towards his truck payments. I paid for his gas, food, clothing, cigars, the rent, everything. I spent a lot of money buying things that would make him happy even if he didn’t ask for them. I got a lot of joy out of surprising him with gifts. His truck got repossessed and without hesitation, I told him not to worry, that I will pay to get it back. I paid for everything and more solely on my own. His excuse for not working was that life was too unstable with me because I have borderline personality disorder (which he has used against me). I am 34 and he is 47. I work my ass off as a nurse and sometimes I pick up extra shifts. His previous girlfriend was about my age. I feel like he targets younger women because nobody his age would put up with his shit.

-Borrowed my car and got hit by another car while parked and didn’t say sorry for that, either. I know it wasn’t his fault, but saying sorry would have been reasonable. We tried to go through the other person’s insurance, but their insurance was horrible and about a month in, I decided to go through my insurance because I have extremely good coverage and he got mad because it wasn’t “our plan”.

-We talked about being better with money and I agreed. We just moved into a new place and I bought a 50 dollar entry way table on Amazon. He flipped out. Ummmmm it’s my money and I was very selective about finding the cheapest table I could.

-I have credit card debt trying to pay for both of us and we agreed to get my credit score higher before applying for a 0% APR card. Shortly after the agreement; I got mad at him about something and applied for one despite “our” plan. I got rejected, but that wasn’t the point. Every time I didn’t take his advice, he got mad. He said I was disregarding his life experience, but I told him I need to make my own mistakes. 

-He got mad when I had coffee too late or if he saw me on the phone while in bed, but should have been sleeping.

I could go on and on, but I am so happy I don’t have to live like this anymore. It was hell. I wasn’t living for myself. I was living to make him happy. If you aren’t happy, if you feel like you have to do things you don’t want to do or your partner will be mad, that’s abuse. At the very least it’s coercion and that’s enough reason to leave. This is your sign to take your life back. Live for yourself. Being lonely can be seen as being at peace. I’m so thankful to have my peace back and not be walking on eggshells. The loneliness is okay.

I had planned to take my final GMAT mock test before the real exam. I woke up early, brewed a strong cup of coffee, and told myself this was going to be the day I broke 730. My prep had been consistent for weeks. Quant felt strong, verbal was finally improving, and I had even started feeling comfortable with data insights. Then, of course, life decided to test me before the GMAT did.

Five minutes before starting the mock, my laptop crashed. Not a simple restart situation, this was a full system meltdown. My test file corrupted, and the GMAT prep software refused to open. I sat there staring at the frozen screen, trying not to panic. I had spent weeks preparing for this moment, and it felt like all of that effort was slipping through my fingers. I remember thinking, if this happens on test day, I’m doomed.

After about twenty minutes of frustration and mild despair, I decided to adapt. I grabbed a notebook, opened an online timer, and took the test manually from memory. It wasn’t perfect, I couldn’t recreate every question, but I tried to simulate the pressure and pace as best as I could. Halfway through, something strange happened. Without the polished software interface, without the stats and analytics, I felt oddly calm. I was just solving problems, not obsessing over the score that would follow.

That improvised mock ended up teaching me more than any official test. It reminded me that no matter how much we prepare, unexpected things will happen. On the real GMAT day, my testing center’s power flickered mid-exam, and while everyone around me panicked, I just smiled and waited. The system rebooted, the clock reset, and I picked up right where I left off, steady, focused, unbothered.

When I got my final score a week later,740, I realized that the technical disaster had been the best prep session I could’ve asked for. GMAT prep isn’t just about mastering formulas or grammar rules. It’s about mastering your nerves when things don’t go according to plan. And trust me, that’s a skill you’ll use long after the test is over.

Hey Reddit,

I’m an interior designer who helps people rebuild after life knocks them down. Grief doesn’t just linger in your heart; it seeps into your walls, turning familiar rooms into reminders of what’s lost.

Last year, a client I’ll call M came to me after losing her partner overnight. Her apartment felt stuck: dishes from their last meal still sat in the sink, and his coat hung like a ghost. Rooms she once loved felt suffocating. The hallways were too dim, and corners were sharp with memories. She said, “I can’t breathe here, but leaving feels like betrayal.”

We skipped the glossy inspiration and focused on one simple question:

“What do you need to feel safe in this space again?”

It wasn’t magic, but it sparked small changes that added up.

The harsh afternoon light in her hallway reminded her of the world’s cruelty. A light, gauzy curtain softened it, and with that, her feeling of arriving home improved. If your space feels aggressive, see where the light hits harshly—softening it can reduce that edge with little effort.

Their shared couch felt too large and empty on one side. Rotating it created a personal nook for reading, away from the void. She draped a soft knit throw over it—something to hold onto when feelings hit. Textures like that ground you; they’re a hug for your senses when touch feels distant. Research shows that soft fabrics can lower cortisol levels, which helps ease the fog grief can bring.

And that single shelf of old photos? She cleared it for one resilient plant that she watered every morning—a tiny ritual saying, “I’m still growing here.” Rituals help rebuild rhythm when everything’s shattered.

I see shadows of this in history: Jackie Kennedy creating homes after tragedy as safe spaces of order, reclaiming control through simplicity after JFK’s death. Coretta Scott King channeled her sorrow into the King Center—a place that held legacy when nothing else could. M’s changes were simpler, but they taught her body gentleness again.

Six months later, she sent a photo: her bedroom bathed in golden hour light, window open, coffee on the sill. Her note said, “I smiled without forcing it.”

If grief has turned your home into a stranger, what’s one small change that helped? A moved chair to catch better light? Removing something that burdens you? Or starting a quiet ritual?

Share if you’d like, or just know that you’re not alone in this journey. Solidarity to anyone feeling that quiet ache.",2,1761841541.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False
1ok4bcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1ok4bcm/the_law_is_actually_this_simple_but_not/,The law IS actually this simple (but not necessarily always easy!),"The law's very very simple (that doesn't necessarily always mean easy) but it's simple in that you don't have to do a lot. You understand the 3D isn't your reality no more, that it can change and bends to your assumptions, both old and new, negative and positive.

You are not suddenly now finding out about manifestation. It's something you've been doing your entire life, maybe it's because we call it manifestation that it might seem like sorcery, but it really isn't. I'm not a huge fan of the word because it makes me feel like I'm wearing a tinfoil hat.

You been doing it your entire life, every thought you've dwelled in, everything you've assumed has come to fruition



(assumption

/əˈsʌm(p)ʃn/

noun

a thing that is accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof.)



I get it, those circumstances of yours are so, so, odd and special and its so exclusive to you and so it must be IMPOSSISSSSLBEEEEE! But that couldn't be further from the truth

When those negative circumstances appeared, it all started with you. You thought of something, a poor circumstance, dwelled on it. Started seeing more of it, creating more of those thoughts and hardening it into stronger fact. You started this process without seeing ANY external proof of it. It was just a thought you dwelled on. When you were manifesting these negative circumstances, you weren't stuck up on whether you were doing everything right, about if you were doing sats properly, about affirming 10K times a day, about how vivid your imaginations are, about the feelings you're getting from it, if there is a secret sauce... You were just imagining something and persisting in it without any proof. Without any idea of the law's existence!! Now, suddenly, you demand external proof even though you've never needed it before for your ''negative'' circumstances?

Okay, I get it. You saw this one thing and that was your ''proof'' or did you.. just..  assign a meaning to an action that could've meant ANYTHING. You could've assigned a positive meaning ''He didn't text me for 5 hours he must be-'' You could've said it's because he was just asleep and will reach out to you as soon as possible. YOU choose how to perceive EVERY action and what meaning to assign to it.

You are the SOURCE of EVERYTHING Everything starts with you. And you're not aware, or remember EVERY single. It is not: something happens > i dwell on it. 

It's:  i dwell on it > something happens > i dwell it on more > more happens

This is why circumstances don't matter, because YOU created the SAME circumstances you are crying about. Don't get me wrong, it's okay to cry. Emotions don't manifest if you don't let them, and you'll most likely feel better after! But some of you will start wavering, doubting, arguing and crying after every minor inconvenience!!! Trust and BELIEVE in yourself!! If only you put as much focus on already having your desire as you would complaining and making excuses about your negative circumstances.

It's really unfortunate that the law means we get stuff we might not necessarily want, but that's also a good thing. It means it does not discriminate, it works both ways. We can use that to our advantage.  Just like you assumed that ''negative'' circumstances of yours (again, you did this without ANY proof!) you can now assume the bestest of circumstances EVER! You didn't need proof for your negative circumstances, why need it now? 

If you weren't worrying about whether you were manifesting a third party properly, why do it now? If you weren't worrying about 10k affirmations, reading every NG post for the secret sauce.. Why do it now? You've always been manifesting and now you're conscious of it. When you start getting into lucid dreaming you're not suddenly learning how to dream. You've always been dreaming and now you're just aware of it.

None of this has to be complicated, you've manifested your perfectly your entire life without fail and suddenly now you overthink everything, demand external proof, whether you're doing it right etc

A lot of you will endlessly search for the secret sauce in manifestation. Watch billions of videos and scour endless reddit posts. There's no need for this. Your circumstances are not special, there is no secret sauce in manifestation (because again you've been doing it your whole entire life) and just like maths, it's something you have to JUST DO to make it click.

You can't keep reading theory on maths you just straight up have to do it. Not just for the love of your life, or that house, or that job, but for EVERYTHING in your life. It's not a quick fix, you always manifest. EVERYTHING in your life. So use it to your advantage anywhere you can. That's how you start realizing circumstances don't matter, that's how you build faith, that's how you will be okay and understanding that person will come back.

That coffee, that phone, that cancelled class, that job, that gift. All of it. You apply it EVERYWHERE, because you will always be using the law and you choose whether to use it in your advantage, or not.

A lot of you try to jump right into manifesting an ex back and that's okay. Because you can manifest multiple things at once. A lot of you seem to think that, you can only focus on that one thing. Manifesting anything else will somehow hinder your progress towards your ''main'' manifestation. Because you see it as this hard task... Like your life depends on this ONE thing. The top of that mountain you're trying to climb and it needs your full focus

But that's not necessarily true. Trying to manifest self concept is a massive help.

It's much easier to build a house on a nice stable platform of rock than sticks. You can still manifest all those ''small things'' while really wanting your ''main'' manifestation. And if it helps you with faith, understand the law? Then that's also beneficial when trying to manifest ANYTHING ELSE that you might deem ''hard''

Seeing it as this hard thing that requires all your focus so you must focus on it to make it come as fast as possible, that's possibly the part that's hindering you most. Because, you, most likely, without even realizing it are constantly thinking to yourself about how hard it is to manifest this thing when in reality it's the same as those ''small things.'' The law doesn't discriminate. Now obviously you can still 100% focus on your ''main'' manifestation and do just that, if you want to. My point is that a lot of you will do it because you think/assume it's so hard that it needs your undivided focus.

You're going to be manifesting those small things in your life anyway, you're either going to be leading them actively or do it passively. I want people to realize this, to actually apply the law and not just endlessly read on theory, question whether they've been doing everything right etc. You most likely already know the answer, you've been manifesting everything your entire life and now just doing it consciously. The amount and what techniques don't matter, you've never worried about techniques in the past, why now? Just do something you enjoy!! That's the best way to do it!!

The more you persist, the more you manifest, the more you apply, the more it'll click and that's the best way. Conscious experience is the BEST way to get better, always, at any skill and manifestation's not any different. Manifestation is a lifestyle so apply it to your entire life, not just as a quick fix for your so, because you've discovered something wonderful here.

I know a lot of people will still try and beat their head against the same wall but I hope I at least cleared some doubts, helped people understand what they've gotta do, how the law works etc and to just stop questioning everything and apply and persist!!!!

Had finished this project before harvest but been busy operating combine for weeks now. This was something simple that my dad & mom worked out. Using 1 x 3 11 gauge rectangle tubing for most of the structure. The inner rectangles are 1/2 square tube 13 gauge steel. The Sun Moon and Star are 1/2 inch solid square stock.

The benches are also 1 x 3 11 ga. rectangle bolted to the dock and to the railings for strength. I went with this ""odd"" size to work with the 2 x 6's being used for the seats & back of benches and to have that perfect size for setting a hot coffee or cold beer atop of. Everything is powder coated black. The lumber will be rubber coated but dad hasn't decided on the color he wants yet.

Give me your honest opinions. Most of my work is agriculture welding repair and lawn ornamates/sculpture. I used to do work for cattlemen on custom sized continuous pipe fencing/corrals as well but that work was too hard on my back.

1ok4a7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiforhospitality/comments/1ok4a7x/the_inn_bakery_partnership_that_increased_repeat/,The inn + bakery partnership that increased repeat bookings (no marketing budget required),"There's a clear pattern emerging in small hotel and vacation rental marketing: the properties that thrive aren't the ones spending the most on ads—they're the ones collaborating locally.

**Real example:** A West Virginia inn partnered with the bakery next door. Every guest got a warm pastry at breakfast: no formal contract, just a conversation and a handshake.

Result? Guests started timing their trips around that breakfast ritual. The inn's weekends sold out. The bakery's mornings got busier.

**Another one:** Corfu's off-season used to be dead. A local brewery teamed up with hotels and restaurants to create the Corfu Beer Festival. 10,000+ visitors showed up during what used to be the quietest month.

According to research from HospitalityNet and RTO9, approximately 85% of hotels experience improved guest reviews after starting to partner locally. Guests want a story, not just a bed.

**The formula is simple:**

* Pick ONE local business your guests already love
* Have ONE real conversation
* Create ONE easy offer (coffee discount with room key, early seating at a restaurant, whatever)

If it's complicated, it's not collaboration—it's homework.

**Question for hosts here:** Have you done anything like this? What local partnerships have actually moved the needle for you?

So here's some backstory I met joe back in May 2022 when I was 23 & he was 37, we hit it off really well we started dating June 2022 sharing ex horror stories & I tell him I can't stand being yelled at ill automatically shut down & remain quiet, I also don't put up with being hit due to being in a previous very abusive relationship both physical & verbal & he informed me his don't s & we swore/promised to not cross each other's boundaries (this will be important later) we also told each other past medical injuries/conditions such as I have constant back hip & knee pain (also will be important later),I moved into his 1 bedroom apartment with him & his sweet adorable dog named sweetie also not real name here's the layout of the apartment-walking in the front door you enter the living room to the left is the kitchen/pantry also the back door to the right was a small hallway, bathroom, closet, & bedroom (the bedroom didn't have a door), so Joe & I grew closer enjoying life as I become a second human for his dog to be comfortable with in the apartment daily & had a deep connection then 2-4 weeks into living with him he lets his friend & friends girlfriend move in til they can save up & get their own place the only place for them was to sleep on the living room floor (we'll call them Jim & Jane) well Jim & Jane moved in & it actually went well for about a 8 months then I start noticing that they were starting to just be lazy all around mind you yes they had a job but so did me & Joe yet I was the only person cleaning on a daily basis because I noticed that even on Joe's days off he'd just watch tv with Jim & Jane mind you Jim & jane just layed around watching TV all day using my Wi-Fi which I paid for while pilling dirty dishes,trash,ect all around them in the living room cause they stopped going to work except 2-3 days a week for 2-4 hours, so I bring it up to Joe that I'm getting drained cleaning up after 3 grown adults he immediately started birading me saying he cleans on his days off when he's home alone so he has no distractions & apparently he doesn't believe me due to them telling him they do clean while we're at work mind you at the time I worked full time in customer service working 5-6 days 8-10 hours per shift a week just to come home & clean the apartment top to bottom was exhausting so I continue going about my day waiting for them to get their own place & move out & when I say top to bottom I mean every room absolutely spotless so I'm a gamer I had my PC in the bedroom so on my days off I just started staying in the bedroom so 2 months later apparently I'm making them feel uncomfortable for being antisocial & making joe feel abandoned for always being in the bedroom on my PC when I'm home. So I this continues for 4 more months by this time I'm still cleaning up after 4 adults so I bring it up to Joe once again & apparently Joe realized it as well but was scared to say anything to them about it so we end up arguing about it multiple times over the following 3 months so I decided to stop cleaning up after everyone & keeping to myself only coming out of the bedroom for work,food, restroom, & rare occasion of being home alone with joe this goes on for 3 months which is around the time Jim & Jane start breaking up in the morning & getting back together by the end of the same day & they would argue loudly to the point the entire building heard them & sweetie would be horrified running straight to me jumping in my lap & shaking mind you this was a 90ishlb doberman mix but this dog had trauma from past owner's & joe made sure everyone in the apartment knew not to raise their voice or make loud noises welp guess Jim & jane didn't really care about it anymore but them scaring his dog on a daily basis apparently was Joe's breaking point cause after I tell him their at it again & our neighbor (mine & Joe's friend) also was wondering what was going on Joe comes home & immediately lays into him & Jane about terrifying his dog & being so loud he finally ends up giving them a month deadline to be out of his apartment, after joe finished birading Jim & jane he comes back & goes straight to sweetie seeing her in my lap still shaking we finally get her calmed down & she stays in the bedroom with me laying on my feet, fast-forward it's The Day Jim & Jane have to be out by this time Jane went back to old habits (certain substances) & would go mia for days/weeks so it was just Jim still laying in the living room floor & haven't really been doing anything to prepare for the deadline so he starts making excuses for y he can't move out yet so Joe gladly gives him another month they do this routine 3-4 times then once again jim makes another excuse but Joe finally says no it's time to go cause he wants his apartment back & wants to finally be able to only have me,him & sweetie in the apartment & states I'm lucky to be staying at this point mind you me & joe were paying for everything the utilities were in his name groceries & wifi in mine but once they were finally gone I started be social again sitting in the living room ect me & joe get back to being close & being romantic towards each other & enjoying the piece & quiet,fast forward to fall 2023 by this time I lost my job due to having a hernia surgery & was having trouble finding another so Joe & I came to the conclusion/agreement of me staying home & caring for sweetie so I get in the routine of waking up fixing his morning coffee seeing him off to work cleaning the house top to bottom fixing him ice coffee & taking sweetie for a walk to a nearby park & playing fetch & tug of war going home & gaming til joe gets home with sweetie sitting on the bed watching for joe, fast forward to winter & I start realizing Joe just spends his days off in bed while I get up before sunrise & do my daily routine granted he's still working full time but he does have a set schedule rotating weeks mon,wed,Friday one week Tuesday Thursday Saturday the next but he would stay in bed til noon-3pm wake up drink coffee,& smoke a little ern iykwim then go back to bed by 8pm making me feel unwanted (to preference this I was diagnosed with crippling depression in highschool by a psychiatrist I do manage to keep it suppressed but it does flare up occasionally usually at night) back to the story he continues this routine for months so by this time I feel like I'm just a live in maid/dog sitter I did love spending time with sweetie she was the sweetest loving dog so about 3 weeks in to August 2024 sweetie gets sick & has to be put to sleep me & joe are heart broken so afterwards me & joe continue arguing constantly fast forward to winter 2024 i bring it to Joe's attention that we don't really get to spend time together he immediately goes ballistic ranting & raving about he works all week & comes home exhausted & so what he wants to relax on his days off & complains he never gets alone time unless he's in bed & how apparently he doesn't believe I clean the apartment on a daily basis cause he has to come home & do the 2-3 dishes in the sink so he starts another tyraid about how I need to focus on keeping his apartment clean & stop gaming so much by the time he's done he demands I get out of his apartment he doesn't want to see/sleep next to me mind you it's freezing outside cause beginning/mid winter so I'm forced to walk out into the hallway between apartments as I hear joe slam & chain the door behind me mind u I didn't grab my keys anyway the hallway which is just as cold as outside due to the downstairs door being propped/stuck open 24/7 so I get locked out the entire night sleeping on the balcony freezing to avoid the bright hallway lights he wakes up the next day around 1-2pm so I'm on the balcony in the fetal position shivering cold & can't feel my hands or feet so once he gets up & realizes I'm not in the apartment he pokes his head out the bedroom window &sees me shivering & says "" it's awfully cold outside ain't it"" he closes the window goes back to the living room takes his medicine & finishes his coffee & eventually let's me back in saying ""I ment to let you back in but I got comfy in bed"" so I'm still waiting to warn up & regain feeling in my limbs as I straight up tell him you did what you did which shows me I don't mean anything to you leaving me outside like a dog which is fucking outrageous considering he never did that to sweetie "" he immediately slaps me across the face hard enough to leave a handprint on my face & goes off on another tyraid loud enough the neighbors can hear which I immediately ball up in the fetal position & protect my head & when he raises his hand to slap me again soon as I get an opertunity I run into the bathroom & barricade myself in balling my eyes out as he beats on the door & says your lucky I slapped you I wanted to do worse bringing up my dead dog "" I yell just leave me alone the next thing I hear is the front door slam & him screaming at the top of his lungs""talking to me like that in my apartment who do you think you are"" after I'm able to calm down & stop crying I leave the bathroom & go straight to the bedroom leaving him at this point joe is sitting in the living room lost in the tv show he was watching soon as I get comfortable in bed he comes back much calmer now & starts trying to apologize for both laying his hands on me & yelling at me knowing my past abusive relationships I just ask him again to leave me alone for a while,as I lay in bed I realize he crossed lines he swore not to cross, so my depression immediately starts flooding my head & I come to the conclusion I can't do anything due to me not having a job & so I start crying again as my depression amplifies the hopeless,alone, unwanted feelings I'm experiencing I end up passing out I'm woken up by him flipping me out of bed onto the hard carpet floor,I get off the floor in pain limping to the living room from then on we start drifting apart as he continues birading me daily top of his lungs, complaining about everything I do that he doesn't like me doing such as he really hates me gaming,ect & I need to find a job or else,so from that day I get on a different sleep schedule opposite of him if he got up I went to bed & vice versa,& start looking for a job, fast forward to beginning of June 2025 I get a job at a very popular taco/burrito place & I get the opportunity to start planning my exit, jump to April 2025 I find a place & move out after getting biraded one last time thankfully my workplace & co-workers are so nice 2 of my coworkers helped me move out.

1ok48uc,https://i.redd.it/3xoo5hxuy9yf1.jpeg,Which countertop materials are most durable and low-maintenance?,"If you’ve ever stood in a kitchen showroom, you know how overwhelming countertop options can be. Every slab promises beauty, but not every material holds up to real life, especially in busy Phoenix homes where heat, spills, and family activity are part of daily life.

Let’s break down which materials actually live up to the “durable and low-maintenance” promise so you can invest once and enjoy for years.

# Quartz: The Low-Maintenance Powerhouse

Quartz is the top choice for homeowners who want durability without constant upkeep. It’s an engineered stone made from crushed quartz mixed with resins, which makes it nonporous and incredibly resistant to stains, scratches, and bacteria.

You don’t have to seal it, polish it, or worry about wine or coffee leaving marks. A simple wipe with mild soap and water keeps it spotless.

**Best for:** Busy families or anyone who wants a sleek, consistent look that holds up for decades.  
**Avoid if:** You plan to place extremely hot pans directly on the surface. Quartz can discolor from direct heat.

# Granite: The Classic Workhorse

Granite has earned its reputation for strength. Each slab is unique, offering natural beauty that elevates any kitchen. It’s heat-resistant and extremely hard, meaning you can chop, prep, and even set down hot pots (within reason) without damage.

However, granite is porous, so it requires **periodic sealing** to protect against stains. Many homeowners find sealing once a year (or less with modern sealers) a small price to pay for its timeless appeal.

**Best for:** Homeowners who love natural stone and don’t mind a little maintenance.  
**Avoid if:** You want a completely uniform look or prefer a zero-maintenance surface.

# Solid Surface (Corian): The Seamless Look

Made from acrylic resins, solid surface counters are nonporous, easy to clean, and repairable if scratched. They can mimic the look of stone or concrete but without the seams or upkeep.

While not as hard as quartz or granite, they’re perfect for homeowners who prioritize hygiene, smooth finishes, and an understated design.

**Best for:** Low-traffic kitchens or minimalist designs where a uniform look matters most.  
**Avoid if:** You’re hard on your counters since it can scratch or burn under high heat.

# Porcelain and Sintered Stone: The Up-and-Coming Contenders

These newer surfaces are incredibly durable, nonporous, and resistant to scratches, UV light, and heat. They’re growing in popularity for modern remodels thanks to their sleek, elegant finish.

Porcelain slabs are thinner than quartz or granite, which makes them ideal for contemporary kitchens with clean, minimal lines.

**Best for:** Design-forward homeowners who want cutting-edge materials with ultra-low maintenance.  
**Avoid if:** You’re on a tight budget since they can cost more due to specialized fabrication.

# What We Recommend for Phoenix Homeowners

At Phoenix Home Remodeling, we see quartz outperform nearly every other option in both durability and maintenance. It holds up beautifully in our desert climate, doesn’t stain, and comes in hundreds of colors that complement both traditional and modern homes.

That said, every remodel is unique. The right countertop isn’t just about the strongest material. It’s about what fits your lifestyle, design goals, and willingness for care over time.

If you want help comparing real material samples and seeing how they fit into your overall design, our design-build team walks you through each option before construction ever begins. That’s part of why our homeowners love our process. No surprises, no regrets.

If you want the look of natural stone without the upkeep, go quartz.  
If you love the character of real stone and don’t mind sealing, granite remains a winner.  
And if you crave a sleek, ultra-modern look, consider porcelain or sintered stone.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I just got back from a **5-night Mexican Riviera cruise on Norwegian Bliss**, sailing roundtrip from Los Angeles with stops in Cabo San Lucas and Ensenada. It was my first time doing this itinerary, and I wanted to share a few quick thoughts — the good, and the not so good.

Also, I've put together a video of the trip here if you'd prefer a more visual review: [https://youtu.be/3jnD-YXI9DM](https://youtu.be/3jnD-YXI9DM)

**The Good:**

* The *ship itself is gorgeous* — really modern, clean, and well laid out. I loved all of the little venues for drinks and people watching.
* The **Observation Lounge** is one of the best spaces I’ve seen at sea — perfect for morning coffee or just relaxing.
* The **staff were consistently excellent**, especially in the bars and specialty restaurants.
* **Palomar** and **Le Bistro** both delivered really nice dinners (worth the splurge).
* The **go-karts** are just pure fun — not something I ever thought I’d do on a ship.
* **Three adults survived one balcony cabin**\--it was a little tight but we made it work.
* **Tendering in Cabo** was actually well organized and quite fast.

**The Not So Good:**

* The **main dining room food** was hit or miss — a few things were great, a few were pretty dry or bland, especially the chicken dishes
* The **buffet gets hectic** on sea days; finding a seat felt like a competitive sport.
* T**he Bliss Theater**\--what a bland spot, really surprised how dull that theater was!  And the magic act was kinda...meh.
* **Entertainment was very popular**, especially the comedy acts in the Social Lounge, and most nights it was standing room only 30-45 minutes BEFORE the show, so plan accordingly.  ",14,1761841193.0,NCL,7,1.0,False

Big mistake, as of course they never change. Long story short, They’ve made my life hell here and tried to control all my relationships in the area. I just graduated college and since they kicked me out, I’ve been staying with my grandparents, who they pretty much harassed and cut off for letting me stay there. They demanded all extended family report to them before helping or engaging with me, and somehow they always find out what I’m up to. I am tempted to move back to my old town 10 hours away, I have friends, a job, and a boyfriend there. And space from them to live my own life. However, I got my dream business opportunity to buy a coffee shop here in my hometown. I’m debating whether I should stay and keep it, and try to have better boundaries with my parents, or if it’s safer to sell it and try to get another one further away. Is moving out of the state the best way to thrive without them? I have the opportunity to get my own apartment here which may help. ",2,1761841183.0,raisedbynarcissists,4,1.0,False
