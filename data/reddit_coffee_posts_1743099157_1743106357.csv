I started my youtube channel in January, made YPP earlier this month, and have had what I would consider commensurate success for having a dozen years of transferrable storytelling / design / presentation skills while still being very new to youtube.

All that said: most people trying their hand at the youtube game do not have any creative experience, and you're frankly fighting an uphill battle to not only learn technical craft, but to develop your eyes to be able to improve. To a large extent learning design is not just picking up ""make it pretty"" skills, but learning how to look at something phenomenal and articulate exactly how it is made, and why it is working.

When you're new, you don't understand how Your Thing is failing, because to your eye it seems roughly the same as The Great Thing which you are emulating. The reality is that you are not, in fact, approaching The Great Thing except in the broadest sense -- you're making the equivalent of that old lady's botched restoration of ""*Behold the Man""* in the Sanctuary of Mercy and wondering why everyone on the internet is laughing.

So. Here are some ways to break down a video quantitatively, until you develop the instinct to make these judgements automatically.

**Pacing**  
I think this is the biggest struggle for most Newtubers. You have not developed a great sense of timing, so your videos tend to *drag*.

I want you to pull up The Great Thing you want to copy. Have a stopwatch handy, or just get your spacebar primed to stop and start the video.

1. Calculate the WPM (words per minute) of the reference video to judge the overall speed of delivery. Copy the transcript for a particular section you want to analyze; paste that into a word processor to get the word count; time the length of that section in the video; divide word count by time (in minutes). Now do the same exercise for one of your videos. How does your time compare to your reference?
2. Time the pause between sentences, or the pause after a completed thought before a cut to another. It depends on your style, but these days I find that a lot of popular channels are going at a pretty brisk clip and hardly leaving any empty air.
3. Time how long they let an image or piece of stock footage / b-roll sit on the screen before they cut to another. Most newbies do not cut nearly frequently enough and just let a still sit on screen forever -- it's deadly.
4. Time how long their intro is. I think you'll find that unless it's a very personality-driven channel, they cut to the chase in the first 15-30 seconds. Don't waste this precious time at the front introducing yourself and playing a self-indulgent title card with a logo you bought on Fiverr -- literally no one cares. Your brand is your face, your discussion topics, and your style, not the name of your tiny channel with 10 subs.

**Presentation**  
Youtube is an entertainment business, so for better or for worse you need to develop acting skills to some extent.

1. Enthusiasm -- if you have a naturally monotone voice, this is going to be tricky, but you just need to drill reading with genuine emotion and variety. Read a sentence out loud as though someone just rear-ended you. Read it again as though you just learned you won the lottery. Read it again as though your girlfriend just broke up with you. And so on -- pay attention to how your speed, volume, and pitch changes with each emotion. Generally speaking, for entertainment you kind of need to sound like you've just had three cups of coffee and are about to spill the juiciest tea to your closest friends -- high, fast, and exuberant. If you're doing more academic content you can get away with a slower, lower, more ""scholarly"" delivery.
2. Back to copying your fave -- pick a section of the video, maybe a ""paragraph"" worth of script, and pay attention to their delivery. How does their speed modulate over the course of the section? How is their pitch changing? How are they adding emphasis -- do they use a silly accent, make their voice lower or higher, speed up or slow down? Make notes, and practice delivering the same piece of text just like they do, like you were learning a tonal language. Now apply that rhythm to your own work, and create a pattern that feels natural, but expressive, to you.
3. Once you've mastered your voice, you'll also have to master your face, if you're going to be on camera. Harness the power of a raised brow, a squint, a smirk, a wide eye. Figure out what kind of hand gestures feel natural to you. Watch your faves very closely, and note what small movements and expressions create an emotional connection.

**Editing**  
Some people are such animated, charismatic, organized, and cogent speakers that they can rattle off one take and call it good without any editing. I would guess that most of us aren't those people.

1. Pay close attention to the techniques of your Great Thing. How are they adding comedic effect or emphasis? The ""Tiktok Zoom"" of a quick cut 200x magnified into their face? The ""Ken Burns"" slow zoom inward, or pull outward? A black and white filter? Typography?
2. How are they making ""still"" portions, like a photograph, still feel dynamic? Again, that ""Ken Burns"" slow zoom, side pan? Quick cuts?
3. Use language as your anchor points for cuts. As you switch to another idea, cut. As you reveal a new piece of information, cut. As you make a joke, cut on the punchline.

**Value**  
Now, I fear that you can have the greatest production value in the world -- camera quality, audio quality, personable and charismatic presentation -- and that can get you 50% of the way there, but the remainder is going to be *what value are you actually bringing?* Why does your video matter to anyone but you? Do you have a new perspective, or added nuance to an existing discussion? If you're telling a story someone has told before, how is your version different? How is your personal experience relatable or useful to anyone else? I don't really believe in oversaturation when it comes to entertainment -- we've had what, 10 Spiderman remakes in the last 20 years? -- but I do believe you need to have some spin that is unique to you. Sometimes that spin IS you.

As much as this post is about learning how to deconstruct success in order to replicate it, at the end of the day you need to be able to use those tools to create something fresh (and more importantly *enjoyable*). I can't really coach you on finding that point of differentiation, but at the end of the day, craft combined with value is what makes you worth watching.",1,1743106236.0,NewTubers,0,1.0,False

Every day, my parents walk into a spotless house—a clean living room, dishes washed, dried, and put away, clean cupboards wiped down, no washing up left for them to do. I also do the laundry, folding their clothes individually, vacuuming, mopping, cleaning the bathroom, and sweeping the stairs. Yet, I feel incredibly underappreciated.

The house is a mess every morning, and I am more than happy to clean up after everyone. But every weekend, when my parents are home, they still call me “lazy” if I’m not quick enough to get something sorted, make someone tea, or unload the dishwasher—on top of all my other household work. Now, I’m also expected to cook dinner for everyone.

I am trying to build my own business while preparing for my new job, where I will be away for six months. After finishing my chores, I like to take some time for myself at a coffee shop. But now, on top of everything, I am being pressured to cook dinner too? My mum gets home from work at 3 PM, and most of the time, my sister and I cook for ourselves. However, my mother gets angry when I forget to cook something for my dad.

Sometimes, I am just exhausted from everything I do every day. I feel undervalued, like nothing I do is ever good enough. I even get criticized for going to Costa because my mum can’t go since she works. I get laughed at for not having moved out yet (even though I am moving in April) and looked down on for claiming benefits because I can’t afford my phone bill.

I constantly try to explain that I get tired too and that cooking dinner on top of everything else can sometimes be too much. I deserve a life and appreciation for all that I do. It takes me hours to clean, and it hurts when I’m called lazy, especially when they don’t have to lift a finger.

I have secretly planned to move away for 6–8 months and hopefully permanently, as I will be working on a cruise. I can’t take the name-calling, mockery, and lack of appreciation anymore. I am cutting my family off completely. I am tired. I feel run down. Most of all, I feel depressed.",1,1743106150.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

In summary, I fully expect this post to get hated on, because AI posts almost always do. Nonetheless, I find they can sometimes start interesting speculation and discussion, so I tried my hand at one. Took less time than the pot of coffee I was brewing while I wrote the prompt. In any case, it'll be fun, for me at least, to come back after seeing the film and see how far off the AI was.

So, here was the prompt:

""Yesterday, the main character list for the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday movie were announced. The main characters include The Fantastic Four, Thor, Loki, Captain America (Sam Wilson), Black Panther (Shuri), The Sentry, Ant-Man, Black Widow (Yelana), Bucky Barnes, Red Guardian, Ghost, Namoe, Shang-Chi, Professor X, Magneto, Mystique, Cyclops, Gambit, Nightcrawler, Beast, Falcon (Joaquín Torres), and, of course, Dr. Doom.Given all the events of the MUC leading up to this point and allowing for some cameos from other MCU characters, given that this film is being directed by the Russo brothers, and given the Marvel Comics storylines it is likely to take inspiration from in setting up the next film, Avengers: Secret Wars, can you create a likely synopsis for Avengers: Doomsday, keeping in mind a likely 3-hour runtime?""

And here is the result:

Here’s a plausible synopsis for Avengers: Doomsday, crafted to reflect the MCU’s current trajectory, the Russo Brothers’ storytelling approach, the extensive character list, and the comic book influences like ""Time Runs Out"" and ""Secret Wars"" that are likely shaping this film as a lead-in to Avengers: Secret Wars. The synopsis is structured to fit a roughly 3-hour runtime, balancing action, character moments, and a multiversal narrative.

Synopsis for Avengers: Doomsday  
The multiverse teeters on the brink of collapse. After years of reality-altering events—Loki’s timeline breaches, Wanda’s chaos magic, and Strange’s multiversal gambles—incursions begin tearing through Earth-616, threatening to erase it and all other realities. Victor von Doom, a brilliant and tyrannical variant from a shattered universe, steps into the chaos as both destroyer and self-proclaimed savior. Armed with a device that harnesses multiversal energies, Doom seeks to obliterate the fractured multiverse and rebuild it as a singular, flawless dominion under his control.

Sam Wilson, the new Captain America, unites a fragile alliance of heroes to confront this threat. Shuri’s Black Panther defends Wakanda from incursion fallout, while Scott Lang’s Ant-Man and Yelena Belova’s Black Widow bring ingenuity and grit. The Fantastic Four—Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm, and Ben Grimm—face a Doom more formidable than ever, his intellect amplified by stolen cosmic power. Thor and Loki, bound by rivalry and redemption, join the fight, as do Shang-Chi and Namor, whose earthly domains are imperiled. The Thunderbolts—Bucky Barnes, Red Guardian, and Ghost—offer uneasy aid, their loyalties wavering under Doom’s promises.

The stakes skyrocket when Professor X, Magneto, and their X-Men—Cyclops, Gambit, Nightcrawler, Mystique, and Beast—cross into 616 from a reality Doom has already razed. They warn of his unstoppable campaign, backed by The Sentry, a volatile powerhouse whose raw might serves Doom’s will—until his fractured mind begins to rebel. Joaquín Torres’ Falcon rises as a symbol of hope amid the chaos.

Tracking Doom to a multiversal citadel—a patchwork of dying worlds—the heroes uncover his plan: to trigger a final incursion that will collapse all realities into one he can rule. Reed and Xavier clash over strategy, Shuri and Namor butt heads over leadership, and Magneto’s radicalism tests the team’s unity. Cameos from MCU stalwarts—perhaps Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, or a battle-scarred Nick Fury—hint at a wider resistance forming.

The third act erupts in a reality-spanning battle. Ant-Man infiltrates Doom’s device, Loki sows discord, and Sentry’s turn against Doom shifts the tide—momentarily. In a devastating climax, Doom activates his machine, merging realities into Battleworld, a chaotic realm where he reigns supreme. The heroes, battered and scattered across this new plane, face a grim reality: they’ve lost. As Doom’s victory dawns, the film closes with Sam rallying the survivors, setting the stage for a desperate counterstrike in Secret Wars.

Runtime Structure

* Act 1 (\~1 hour): Establishes the incursions, Doom’s emergence, and the core team (Avengers, Fantastic Four, X-Men), ending with the mutants’ arrival.
* Act 2 (\~1 hour): Deepens character conflicts (e.g., Sam’s leadership, Reed vs. Doom, Magneto vs. Xavier) and reveals Doom’s citadel.
* Act 3 (\~1 hour): Unleashes a multiversal showdown, Sentry’s betrayal, and Battleworld’s creation, concluding with a cliffhanger.

Key Influences

* Russo Brothers’ Style: Emotional stakes (e.g., Bucky’s struggle, Thor-Loki dynamics) blend with grand-scale action, echoing Infinity War.
* Comic Ties: Draws from ""Time Runs Out"" (incursions, multiversal doom) and ""Secret Wars"" (Doom’s godlike rule, Battleworld), tailored to the MCU.
* Secret Wars Setup: Doom’s triumph and Battleworld’s birth mirror the comics’ prelude, priming a larger war.

So anyway.. we exchanged IG and we text daily. We send some silly memes, we're talking about general topics.. would it be too awkward if I ask him to go for a coffee? Or maybe dinner? Or should I text him that I'm interested in him?",1,1743105032.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False
1jlc2p4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jlc2p4/i_asked_god_too_open_my_3rd_eye_and_now_a_demon/,I Asked God Too Open My 3rd Eye And Now A Demon Is Stalking Me.,"Growing up, I lived in a pretty Christian household. Parents reading Bible stories to me as I fell asleep, grandparents taking me to church every Sunday, and other things in a similar vein. As I got older, I started to move away from religion and started to look at the world through a more scientific lens. Now, though, I have reason to believe the Christian God does exist.

Recently I've been pretty bored with my life; everything is moving at a snail's pace with no exciting events coming up. That's where I got the amazing idea to pray to God. It wasn't a normal prayer, though; instead of thanking God for all my blessings and whatnot, I asked a singular favor.

""God, please open my eyes, allow me to see everything I wasn't supposed to, allow me to see everything hiding among us. In Jesus name, Amen.""

At the time, I didn't think much would come of it. I peacefully went to sleep that night with my sanity intact and woke up the next morning with absolutely no change. I went about my normal Monday morning routine of chugging a coffee, eating breakfast, smoking a joint, and taking a shower in preparation for the day ahead. When I was locking my front door as I was leaving for work, I noticed a tall, sickly-looking figure standing at the tree line just across the street from my home. As soon as my gaze focused on the location of where the figure was supposed to be, it vanished. At that point I chalked it up to my hair getting in my eyes mixed with the fact that the sun had just started to rise and it was foggy, not even remembering the prayer I had made the night before.

The rest of the day was uneventful, an average workday, and a long commute back home as expected. I arrived at home around dusk, dragging my feet along the concrete of my driveway out of exhaustion. When I got to my door, I noticed the same exact figure in the same exact location as it was this morning. Except this time when I focused my gaze on where it was, it didn't instantly vanish. Instead, it quickly did a sidestep-esque motion and darted out of view. I still hadn't remembered the prayer from the night before, but I was a little disturbed. The next morning I followed the same routine without incident, and this time the figure wasn't observing me from the tree line. What did happen was objectively more horrifying, though. I got in my car and inserted the keys into the ignition as I checked my mirrors, and what I presume was the same figure from the previous day was standing right at the end of the driveway. This time I could get a good glimpse at its features before blinking and it disappearing; it was unearthly pale, almost glowing from the peeking sun shining down on its skin, with matted and messy hair accompanied by its blank, dead eyes and its frown stretching down to its chin, showing off its chipped, yellow, jagged teeth off in the process.

I was rightly terrified, shuffling to put my car in reverse, stomping on the gas doing so. I was contemplating seeing a psychiatrist before thinking back to 2 nights ago, when I prayed that prayer. The prayer and sighting of what I now classified as a demon haunted my psyche for the rest of the day. As I arrived home, I rushed to my door and frantically unlocked it, not even checking my surroundings to see if the demon was waiting for me to arrive. Every room I entered, I turned the lights on; even when exiting, I didn't turn them off. I even ended up sleeping with a nightlight next to my bed. The next day *mostly* went off without a hitch. No tree line figures or car mirror demons today. When arriving back home, I chuckled at the thought of a demon stalking me of all people.

That was until I attempted to sleep; as I was drifting off into unconsciousness, I heard three consecutive knocks on the window behind my bed. I jolted awake, looked at my window, and it had the writing ""Don't be afraid"" engraved into it, but not from the outside; it was engraved from the inside. I was too scared to sleep in my bedroom, so I grabbed a pillow, the revolver sitting in my nightstand drawer, and proceeded to sleep on the couch. Even then it took hours for me to fall asleep, and that was reflected by how groggy and tired I was upon waking up. As I entered the bathroom to brush my teeth and shower, the light was turned off, even though the previous night I had left it on. For a split second after the lights came on, I could see those same dead eyes staring directly into me through the mirror. I gasped and stumbled backward, shaking with fear. As I got up, I could see the mirror, and the demon was gone, but now it was inside my house, possessing it. With my deteriorating mental and physical condition, I should have called out sick to my job, but I couldn't bring myself to be in the same home as the thing that was stalking me. On my way to work, I called my friend, Thomas, to see if he wanted to come over and have a few drinks after I got off work, thinking it'd be a good way to ease my anxiety from this ordeal, and maybe if he could see it too, I'd prove to myself that I wasn't going crazy.

After work I picked him up from his house, catching up on the drive to my place as it'd been a while since we talked.

""So how do you like living alone? Doesn't it get lonely at some point?"" Thomas inquired.

""Yeah, it does. Why'd you think I invited you over?"" I asked.

""Because there's a demon stalking you, and you feel crazy."" Thomas replied.

I let my foot off the gas until we came to a stop. I looked over at Thomas, and his body was elongated, with his head turned at a sharp 90-degree angle to fit inside, almost like his neck was snapped. When I looked at his face, though, when I looked at his face. He had the exact dead eyes and teeth of the demon that had been stalking me, the same unearthly pale skin. Except in this instance the demon wasn't frowning; it was smiling from ear to ear as its chapped lips dripped blood. I jumped out of the car and ran and ran and ran and ran.

I'm lost in a forest now, writing this with 1 bar of service and 2 percent battery. It has been 2 hours since I jumped out of the car, and it's pitch black besides the faint glow of the moon and my phone screen. No matter where I look, I see it in the corner of my eyes, and every time I blink, I hear a step being taken on the crunchy, dead leaves below me. It's only getting closer; I'm not sure what it wants with me, but I don't imagine it's pretty. Is there any way to ward it off?  Please, don't end up like me; don't ask God to open your 3rd eye; it will not end well.",7,1743105004.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I woke up this morning, got out of bed, and walked into the kitchen—only for my family to act like I wasn’t there. I spoke. I waved my hands. Nothing.

I thought maybe they were messing with me, but then I left the house and went outside. My neighbors didn’t react when I walked by. At the store, the cashier looked straight through me. I bumped into someone, and they just kept walking.

It was like I had become a ghost, but I could still touch things, feel things. My body was still here. I could eat, drink, and sleep, but no one responded to me. I checked my phone, and my messages were marked as “Sent” but never “Read.” My calls rang endlessly. I started leaving notes in my family’s room, but they never mentioned them.

At first, I panicked. I screamed into the void, tried to make sense of it. Then something even stranger happened. A man in a coffee shop—someone I’d never met before—looked right at me and said, “You’re one of us now.”

I don’t know what that means. I don’t know if this is a dream, an alternate reality, or if I’ve just finally disconnected from the world in a way no one comes back from.

Has anyone ever felt like this? Like you’re still here, but at the same time… not?",1,1743104951.0,depression,0,1.0,False

I'm a teenager (17) and I'm living with my mother, I love her but sometimes I can't stand her. We have gone through much together but especially in the last years I can't stand just how much her behavior reminds me of a child, I understand she does much but it's driving me mad. Anyway, besides many other things, one thing that drives me crazy is when she is screaming for something with the excuse ""It's tastes or looks better when you do it"". One thing is coffee, I know it's a small thing to do, but I'm starting to dislike making coffee for anyone because she always asks me. She keeps screaming and screaming that i should make her the coffee because it tastes better, even when I'm clearly annoyed, doing something else or just don't want to, she keeps screaming my name and puts coffee behind it so {name}- coffee. Am I just sensitive? Even when I do instant noodles, juice, tea, it's always that ""it's better when you make it"" completely ignoring if I don't want to. I just end up doing it because it annoys me and way to often. I tried to talk to her about it but every time it's ""Well, if you don't want to do something small for me, I can stop doing things and we will see who is doing the most for who"".

1jlc10g,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1jlc10g/my_bio_dad_surprised_me_at_workaita/,My bio dad surprised me at work-AITA,"Okay so to explain the title my biological father was never in the picture. He knew about me and paid child support, but him and my mom were never together. I was a result of a drunken one night stand and he was basically a dead beat and my mom didn't want me to be raised by him. He rarely wanted anything to do with me as a child and my mom didn't go out of her way to give him updates or tell him much about me or my life. Basically she knew he never cared. He has had many children with different women since he was 16 and a couple of the women (including my mom) never wanted anything to do with him. He's had criminal charges before while I was growing up (mostly petty theft and anything to do with marijuna) and never kept a job. During my childhood he probably stopped reaching out or sending me birthday or Christmas stuff when I was like 6 years old and he started resurfacing when I was an adult a few times on Facebook. He had reached out to me and my mom a few times and each time I would block him and barely read what he had to say. The most recent attempt before this incident he messaged me like 3 or four years ago on Father's Day asking to get to know me and meet me and I blocked him. My mom thought maybe his existing kids weren't getting along with him so he was desperate and trying to reach out to the kid he hadn't met yet. He has always been a very self centered person. So let's get to what happened-I work in an office building on the top floor. One day I had my AirPod in my ear and it fell out and went down the elevator shaft. I knew we had building managers and asked the receptionist if he could go to the basement and find it for me since I had just gotten them for Christmas (from my actual dad that was there for me growing up) and he did. I asked what his name was and thanked him (it's a very common ""M"" name). Fast forward a couple months and my mom gets a message on Facebook from him because they commented on the same picture that was posted in a group that shared memories of a bar that doesn't exist anymore. The picture was of one of their friends that passed away. Anyway he dm'd her asking if she could talk to me about meeting me yadda yadda and she said she would mention it but reiterated that it's not likely I would be interested (which was correct). Typical bio dad behavior. So I had noticed this building manager had been hanging around on my floor more after this AirPod incident and didn't really think much of it. I asked the receptionist if he was new or something and she had confirmed that he took over for a previous building manager a few months ago. Okay, makes sense. Our office is very high security. We have to scan badges to get to the main office areas, different floors, and even to get to specific floors on the elevator. I work in the legal field. So that matters because our service team is the only ones that can let anyone in if something needs repaired or painted or for the shredding company to pick up the shred bins. Basically if you don't work here, you don't have access to the office. Just the lobby and conference rooms. There's security on the first floor, too, for mail and food deliveries and to keep the parking ramp safe, etc. One day around 3 o'clock or something like that on what I think was a Thursday, this building manager just shows up at my cubicle. No one was with him that would have let him in and supervised him. He had installed new carpet on the elevators that week and I had said he did a good job thinking he was just a strange dude. Before I said that, I was feeling uncomfortable and thought I should just say something random. He kept saying ""I think you'll want to talk to me"" ""Don't you want to know who I am?"" ""We should get some coffee sometime"" ""We should talk outside""... I was getting really uncomfortable and confused saying like ""I don't know why I would?"" ""I don't know you""... I was thinking he was trying to hit on me or something until he pulls a picture out of his wallet of me from 7th grade..... I was mortified. All the blood from my body left me. I felt sick, panicked and also trapped because obviously I'm in a freaking cubicle. Of course I'm flustered and like ""oh okay yeah I get it"" ""sure we can get coffee after work sometime"" ""How are your other kids, aren't they parents now?"" Like clearly at a loss for words and just wanting him to go away. My coworker was a cubicle away hearing all of this and an attorney nearby was also in tuned to his presence being strage. My coworker and I are close friends of like 8 years before I got this job and like fully aware of what's going on and asking if she wants her to call security over our private chat system. So, luckily I wasn't just alone in the situation but still very much being traumatized every second of his presence. I don't know how the conversation ended or how I got him to leave. He was probably at my desk for a good 30 minutes telling me that I'm pretty and weird shit I didn't want to hear. I'm assuming he was just happy to have a kid that was doing well? I don't know any of my half siblings other than a couple of their names and that the two I know about have children which makes me an estranged aunt. Ones a male that's 3 years older than me and the other is a female that is a year younger than I. Idk why this man wants a relationship with me if I never once ever showed any interest in the 28 years of my existence at that point. Who does this when they have been blocked, blown off, been told directly by me ""this does not benefit me and I have no interest in your life or family"" and being blocked on Facebook not just scream that I don't care about him and am clearly indifferent of his existence? He's done nothing but pay mandatory child support and gave me maybe 3 or 4 gifts when I was younger than 7 then disappeared until I was in my 20s??? My mom obviously sent him pics or something growing up but probably by his own request so that's how he had that picture of me from middle school. Probably put it in his wallet when he figured out who I was months ago when he when down the elevator for me and just watched me for months without saying anything!!!! But alas, I went home after that like an hour before I normally would leave because I had to go home to process what happened and was scared for my life tbh. I know I sound dramatic but this person is literally a stranger that has pursued me for years and had been given clear boundaries by myself to never contact me. Well the next day was Friday and I was living in a twilight zone. Scared that he was going to show up again and talking with my coworker on what to do about it. Her and I both don't have a relationship with our bio dads she she understood. I decided I would talk to HR on Monday and see what I could do to never see him again. I told them he doesn't need to lose his job over it but I felt my safety was at stake and that my space has been violated. She would have to talk to his company since he's not one of our employees, but hired by the owner of the building. The update was that he would be immediately sent to a location 45 minutes away and not allowed back to my office. He lasted 3 weeks at the new location and was fired. I felt bad. I wasn't trying to ruin his life or get revenge, just trying to keep my peace and what I had left of it since I almost quit my job over the incident. My boss had no idea about it. Just the one attorney, my coworker that is a close friend and HR. Later I found out the receptionist was told about it because the old building manager came back and they're both old people that clearly like to gossip. That was not a fun thing to find out that the gossipy receptionist knows my personal life business. I think she's respectful enough that she only just informed me that she found out about what happened. Luckily she's retired now lol. But yeah still here at my job two years later and wondering if I was the A-hole for giving him hope but lied and made him lose his job. I think he probably finally takes me seriously, though. Also PS I have a very wonderful, kind, active father figure since I was a baby that adopted me into his family when he met and married my mom. They divorced when I was 2 and stayed in my life without any legal ties or responsibility for me. Just out of pure love and interest in staying in my life as a father. I also have a step dad that would harm anyone who does me wrong (including my bio dad-they grew up together and has hated him since before I was born and before me met my mom) so yeah I'm not some fatherless damsel in distress. I'm just fulfilled in my life and so it's his loss not mine. Lots of love to you all but I'd love to know your thoughts!",1,1743104627.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

1jlbzts,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1jlbzts/aita_for_wanting_my_wife_to_retire/,AITA for wanting my wife to retire,"Hey Everyone!

Let me start off by saying thank you for taking time to read this, it's gonna be a long one.

Normally I wouldn't be a person to ask this question due to my own insecurities but I'm currently in a manic state and can't fall asleep. Also at this point, I am going all in on my wife and I's dream of building a homestead.

So what does one do but reach out to the internet.

Okay.

I (30) am a house-husband. My wife (31) is a nurse at Children's Hospital here in Seattle. She is a NICU/PICU nurse. For the med folks out there, all I get are stories, I have a really hard time keeping up with what she does on a daily but I love to listen to her talk about it.

I wanna tell you the story of how I met my wife really quick.

We met on Hinge. I was about to delete it because I had already got banned on Tinder for putting the quote ""selling dick $40 an inch"" - (GOODMORNINGTOKYO) as a joke. But no one took it that way. Anyways, this wonderful woman happen to match with me and we hit it off. I was working as a bartender at a place called Winchesters in Omaha, Ne. Little did I know that she was just living 1 mile down the road, a stones throw away from my mom and I's first house that we've ever had. (Our first real home)

Soon we became very close and fell deeply in love. For the first couple months, it was a perfectly healthy relationship. When I met her in person, I was working. She had messaged me asking if I wanted a cup of coffee since I was closing the bar. Thank the gods I said yes, it was that moment I met the woman that I would soon travel across the country for, twice, pick up my life and move to a place neither of us had ever been too, twice, get a new puppy and raise it together, and finally be in a place to tackle life with a partner wholeheartedly.

Unfortunately, my father died within those first few months of us getting together. It was a very hard time for me and my family, and it still is. He overdosed. I like to say he was Mac Miller'd. Being who she is, My Ellie, choose to stay with me. After I had heard the news of my fathers untimely passing, Ellie and I sat down and talked about our relationship like couples should. I told her that it was really early into our relationship for something so traumatic to happen that I wouldn't expect her to stay with me. To give more context, I came from a teenage pregnancy, my mother raised me by herself, I have siblings, long story short, my family has been through the ringer. This isn't the time or place. Right now is about my wife.

I wasn't expecting her to stay with me because chaotic things seemingly happen to me and my family all the time and at this point in my life, I've been heartbroken enough, I was trying to give her the easy out.

She said no. She got angry but calmly looked at me holding my hands firmly and said, ""Why would I leave?""

Through the funeral and the coming months we had some challenges like any other couple but we communicated and worked out stuff out like adults. I love her and she loves me unconditionally. Our bond solidified.

Within a year, she was travelling for her job and I was bartending still. We did long distance. I would save up money to spend out in Seattle and she would buy my plane tickets to come see her every weekend. We would talk about work and she would tell me about it and my heart began to ache.

She had lost another one.

She works in a specific field within the hospital that deals with Intensive Care but for children. If you don't know what a PICU/NICO nurse does. Look it up. These nurses deserve the world.

My wife is the nurse that works with dead and dying children.

Without getting into anything specific. It's horrible, there is no way to sugar coat it. In our house, we are very grounded to reality. Dark Humor goes very far.

Anyways, we got married on 12-21-24 on exactly 4:20 (when we signed the papers) on the rooftop of our apartment under the sun and moon, eyeshot from Mt Rainer, on a perfect day, a surprise for my mother actually. They sky literally cleared before our eyes. I would like to think my dad was there looking down on his son, proud he found someone to love him so whole heartedly. We decided to elope and it was the best decision I ever made.

I purposed at a Jonas Brothers/Lawrence Concert. I know, I rock. Coolest thing is that I didn't pay a fucking dime. I was high one day, decided to message Clyde Lawrence on Instagram his manager ended up getting back to me and it was as easy as that. Seriously, shout out Clyde, Gracie, The Band, and everyone who helped take photos and videos! I think the video is out there somewhere. Again that's another story on how I got the ring in unnoticed. Couldn't of paid for a better experience

Point being is, when I'm determined to do something I do it. It's how I learned guitar and that I will go to any lengths to achieve the goals we have together. Over the last year, my wife and I are thriving. We are working on ourselves, I learned how to cook, I'm the COO of our house, she's the CFO and focuses on positive mental health and healthy habits. I feel like we both have grown so much. Even right now, she's laying in bed, blacked out shades, earplugs in, trying her hardest to get sleep so she can take care of these children. She is the one that is doing it. Unconditionally.

One of my favorite memories I have of working at Winchesters was when one of the owner's relatives approached me and spoke to me about my wife. They had lost someone close to them and My Ellie, took care of their little one in her final moments. They had nothing but great things to say and praised her so highly. I started crying. Wiping away tears, I thanked them for their kind words and I passed along the message to El, expressing how happy I was. She still doesn't take compliments well.

Finally, we get back to why I am asking you to help me. My wife is my everything. The life we describe together, I want. I will do anything within my power to make it happen. I am fortunate enough to be a house-husband and I am so thankful for that. I feel like more men should be house-husbands. It's great. She has literally been with me at my worst and made me a trophy husband. I want to give her this life. I want her to live on farm she built with me, raise chickens, grow our own food and weed, and help provide that life and lifestyle to our closest loved ones.

I have always thought that we messed up as a society when we strayed away from family living together and now more than ever.

So I ask you the internet. Are you kind enough to help a man provide the life his wife has given him.

I stream. I have no shame. Judge me. I love my Wife. I am a certified-midwest born trophy husband and my wife likes to remind me.

If anyone reads this, thank you. I think I will go to bed now. You can find me on YT go Turtle House! Let's get it! Like I said I'm going all in guys. Wish me luck.

1jlbvrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1jlbvrs/i_asked_grok_3_to_write_a_doomsday_synopsis/,I asked Grok 3 to write a Doomsday synopsis.,"EDIT: There was originally more to this post, including my thoughts on what the AI had spit out, but I am making these posts in the middle of Reddit's internal server problems today, and a bunch of it got lost in the jank. In summary, I fully expect this post to get hated on, because AI posts almost always do. Nonetheless, I find they can sometimes start interesting speculation and discussion, so I tried my hand at one.  Took less time than the pot of coffee I was brewing while I wrote the prompt. In any case, it'll be fun, for me at least, to come back after seeing the film and see how far off the AI was.

So, here was the prompt:

""Yesterday, the main character list for the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday movie were announced. The main characters include The Fantastic Four, Thor, Loki, Captain America (Sam Wilson), Black Panther (Shuri), The Sentry, Ant-Man, Black Widow (Yelana), Bucky Barnes, Red Guardian, Ghost, Namoe, Shang-Chi, Professor X, Magneto, Mystique, Cyclops, Gambit, Nightcrawler, Beast, Falcon (Joaquín Torres), and, of course, Dr. Doom.Given all the events of the MUC leading up to this point and allowing for some cameos from other MCU characters, given that this film is being directed by the Russo brothers, and given the Marvel Comics storylines it is likely to take inspiration from in setting up the next film, Avengers: Secret Wars, can you create a likely synopsis for Avengers: Doomsday, keeping in mind a likely 3-hour runtime?""

And here is the result:

Here’s a plausible synopsis for Avengers: Doomsday, crafted to reflect the MCU’s current trajectory, the Russo Brothers’ storytelling approach, the extensive character list, and the comic book influences like ""Time Runs Out"" and ""Secret Wars"" that are likely shaping this film as a lead-in to Avengers: Secret Wars. The synopsis is structured to fit a roughly 3-hour runtime, balancing action, character moments, and a multiversal narrative.

Synopsis for Avengers: Doomsday  
The multiverse teeters on the brink of collapse. After years of reality-altering events—Loki’s timeline breaches, Wanda’s chaos magic, and Strange’s multiversal gambles—incursions begin tearing through Earth-616, threatening to erase it and all other realities. Victor von Doom, a brilliant and tyrannical variant from a shattered universe, steps into the chaos as both destroyer and self-proclaimed savior. Armed with a device that harnesses multiversal energies, Doom seeks to obliterate the fractured multiverse and rebuild it as a singular, flawless dominion under his control.

Sam Wilson, the new Captain America, unites a fragile alliance of heroes to confront this threat. Shuri’s Black Panther defends Wakanda from incursion fallout, while Scott Lang’s Ant-Man and Yelena Belova’s Black Widow bring ingenuity and grit. The Fantastic Four—Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm, and Ben Grimm—face a Doom more formidable than ever, his intellect amplified by stolen cosmic power. Thor and Loki, bound by rivalry and redemption, join the fight, as do Shang-Chi and Namor, whose earthly domains are imperiled. The Thunderbolts—Bucky Barnes, Red Guardian, and Ghost—offer uneasy aid, their loyalties wavering under Doom’s promises.

The stakes skyrocket when Professor X, Magneto, and their X-Men—Cyclops, Gambit, Nightcrawler, Mystique, and Beast—cross into 616 from a reality Doom has already razed. They warn of his unstoppable campaign, backed by The Sentry, a volatile powerhouse whose raw might serves Doom’s will—until his fractured mind begins to rebel. Joaquín Torres’ Falcon rises as a symbol of hope amid the chaos.

Tracking Doom to a multiversal citadel—a patchwork of dying worlds—the heroes uncover his plan: to trigger a final incursion that will collapse all realities into one he can rule. Reed and Xavier clash over strategy, Shuri and Namor butt heads over leadership, and Magneto’s radicalism tests the team’s unity. Cameos from MCU stalwarts—perhaps Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, or a battle-scarred Nick Fury—hint at a wider resistance forming.

The third act erupts in a reality-spanning battle. Ant-Man infiltrates Doom’s device, Loki sows discord, and Sentry’s turn against Doom shifts the tide—momentarily. In a devastating climax, Doom activates his machine, merging realities into Battleworld, a chaotic realm where he reigns supreme. The heroes, battered and scattered across this new plane, face a grim reality: they’ve lost. As Doom’s victory dawns, the film closes with Sam rallying the survivors, setting the stage for a desperate counterstrike in Secret Wars.

Runtime Structure

* Act 1 (\~1 hour): Establishes the incursions, Doom’s emergence, and the core team (Avengers, Fantastic Four, X-Men), ending with the mutants’ arrival.
* Act 2 (\~1 hour): Deepens character conflicts (e.g., Sam’s leadership, Reed vs. Doom, Magneto vs. Xavier) and reveals Doom’s citadel.
* Act 3 (\~1 hour): Unleashes a multiversal showdown, Sentry’s betrayal, and Battleworld’s creation, concluding with a cliffhanger.

Key Influences

* Russo Brothers’ Style: Emotional stakes (e.g., Bucky’s struggle, Thor-Loki dynamics) blend with grand-scale action, echoing Infinity War.
* Comic Ties: Draws from ""Time Runs Out"" (incursions, multiversal doom) and ""Secret Wars"" (Doom’s godlike rule, Battleworld), tailored to the MCU.
* Secret Wars Setup: Doom’s triumph and Battleworld’s birth mirror the comics’ prelude, priming a larger war.

This synopsis juggles the sprawling cast, roots the conflict in MCU history, and delivers a thrilling, unresolved end to fuel anticipation for the next chapter.",0,1743103532.0,marvelstudios,2,0.19,False

1jlbvj3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jlbvj3,Review on my Shobi perfumery order,"My Shobi perfumery order arrived yesterday. I'm really happy I tried them out. Took 7 days to ship to Germany. Shipping was 9 euro, which I think is fine. 

I ordered the 50ml with 3ml extra essence. I am glad I didn't take the 5ml. Next time I might even just take 2ml extra. I looove strong scents especially with gourmand or oriental fragrances. But oh boy, I sprayed only once on the back of my hand and it was like my whole body was surrounded by the scent. It lasted the whole day and it was so intense. I love it. But a tiny bit more and it would be overpowering. So really go slow on them. One or two sprays are more than enough. And I say that as somebody who usually sprays 5 or 6 times.

The clones are really nice. I got the dupe of Mancera Amore Caffee and Kilian Sunkissed Goddess. I would say they are 80-90%  like the original. But I also read on some other posts that the Shobi perfumes need to marinate and will develop over time. I can really imagine thats true. They mix the fragrance fresh after you order so it takes some time to develop the finished perfume. I will definately order again. I like the variety of bottle sizes so can just try a smaller one and then get a bigger one later.

The Amore Caffee dupe has a strong dark coffee and Amaretto opening. Later it gets sweet and smoky. The dupe gets a hint of Dior Tobacolor, to me at least. I love that.

The Sunkissed Goddess dupe is a bit more powdery and creamy as the original, not as fruity and fresh. But still a great fragrance for spring and summer.

I'm glad I ordered and I will try other ones from Shobi 🩷

I want to share my story and situation i got myself into (friendzone) for the good and am seeking any advice on how do i approach both myself and my mental and the girl.

I broke up with my ex a year ago, it was a too-long RS and have fully moved on so im basically new to dating. I’m 29, have a bachelor's degree, a stable job, and a side hustle of my own. I train regularly, have a great social life, and am surrounded by a solid group of friends. However, I haven't dated or hooked up in the past year—not because I can’t, but because I simply don’t want to. I’m the kind of guy who values relationships over casual encounters. I guess you could say I’m old-school in that regard. Plus, I live in a relatively small European town where hookup culture isn’t as prominent.

Now, onto the situation that’s been on my mind:

About six or seven months ago, while hanging out with friends one summer night, I ran into an old classmate from elementary school. We hadn't seen each other in 15 years, even though we live just a few streets apart. Back in college, she had reached out to me a couple of times, but I never really saw her as a potential romantic interest. The reason? She was extremely religious when we were kids—so much so that my 12-year-old brain found it overwhelming.

That night, she and her friends ended up joining us in the town square, and that’s how we reconnected. She mentioned that she didn’t have many opportunities to go out and asked me to invite her whenever my friends and I were hanging out. She even brought board games, drinks (including alcohol), and introduced us to Carcassonne, which made for some great times together.

Over time, I started liking her. She was the same person I remembered but more mature, laid-back, spontaneous, and driven. Plus, she wasn’t as religious as she used to be, which was important to me.

After a month or two of us hanging out every couple of weeks, I finally worked up the courage to ask her on a date. But before I could say anything, while I was driving her home one night, she broke down in tears and told me her father had been diagnosed with cancer. That moment hit me hard. Coming from a similar experience myself, I was stunned. I hugged her, thanked her for trusting me with that, and told her I was there for anything she needed—whether it was talking, running errands, or driving her dad to appointments.

At that point, I knew I had friend-zoned myself. But I was fine with it because I told myself, I’d rather be her friend than be the guy who walked away when she needed support the most.

After that, she stopped hanging out with us. I reached out maybe once or twice a month, inviting her to go out, but she never accepted. She was juggling two jobs, taking care of her younger siblings, and prioritizing time with her parents, which I completely understood. We still exchanged a few nice messages, and I even invited her to spend New Year's with us, but she chose to stay with her family, which again, I respected.

For months, things remained the same—until last month, when she unexpectedly reached out and invited me to watch her younger brother’s boxing match with her whole family. I didn’t hesitate. I have no problem meeting people’s parents, and I tend to make a good impression. So, I went.

That night, I met most of her relatives, including her dad, and was happy to see him looking well. We spent a few hours at the event talking, joking, and catching up. She even drove me home afterward—with her mom in the car.

During the event, we stepped away for coffee, just the two of us. At the time, I had something to celebrate and wanted to pay, but she jokingly but firmly said, “Hey, I invited you, so I’m paying. Were you really about to buy me a coffee for that? Take me somewhere nicer.” It was playful and lighthearted but also felt like a confident, natural response.

Since then, we've only exchanged a few messages about the event—until three days ago.

My mom came home and told me she had run into her mom. Apparently, during their chat, her mom and aunt mentioned me, teasing her(the girl) about whether I had a girlfriend. They even encouraged her to reach out to me because they thought I would be a good match for her. Her response? She told them she didn’t want to “ruin the friendship” (which, to be fair, we never really had in the first place).

Now, three days later, this is still on my mind. She’s an amazing girl, even though I don’t know her that well yet. What I do know is that she comes from a good family, is hardworking, and has always been genuinely kind to people.

I haven’t reached out to her because, well, I respect myself first of all, but at the same time, I wonder… What if she actually likes me but is afraid to risk the “friendship” that was never really there.


This is a really long text and i wouldn't be writing it if i didn't care this much, not only i like her but i know that she is kind hearted and good person overall.

After meeting with them several times and crossing all the t's and dotting all the i's and agreeing on my fee, all was set for the wedding. On the day of the wedding I kept hearing people complain that the ""happy couple"" were charging everyone in attendance a ""wedding tax"" of $100 - $500. Thinking this was strange and a little out there, but I decided that it wasn't my business and what the bride and groom did to secure funds for their wedding shouldn't concern me. (ding....ding...ding....wrong answer!).

After performing a beautiful ceremony with the newlyweds sharing both a unity candle and a unity sand ceremonies, everyone exited to the reception in the next room. Before I could either remind them about me fee or remind them that we all needed to sign the marriage license they hit me with a big bombshell. They told me that EVERYONE needed to pay them a minimum ""wedding tax"" fee of $100, and that included me. Mind you I have not yet collected my $50 fee, (yes, I only charged them $50). They told me that it was a ""requirement"" for everyone attending the wedding. Remember, I have yet to sign the marriage license. I told them I shouldn't have to pay since i performed their wedding, AND they still needed to pay me my fee. They both said that if I didn't pay ""my share"" I should leave and not attend the reception. (cue evil internal grin). I said fine, and left, leaving an UNSIGNED marriage license with them.

I was about half way home when my phone began to ring with calls and texts from, the bride, the groom, both MILs, and a couple of bridesmaids. I waited until I got home to read them and then relaxed with a cold beer. All of them apologizing for charging me to attend the wedding and said that if I returned they would pay me what they owed me and I could even stay for the remainder of the reception if I signed the license. After about an hour, I started to return calls and informed them that I was so ""distraught"" about everything that I had a few (only one) beers when I got home and couldn't drive back there to sign the license.

The next day I met with the newlyweds AND their mothers at an agreed upon coffee shop. The ""happy couple"" would barely make eye contact with me and the mothers did most of the talking. They apologized for the way that I was treated and that they shouldn't have even thought about charging me anything. Then the bride's mother handed me an envelope with $500 cash saying that it was for what I endured from their children. (I learned later from another party that the $500 came from the couple's honeymoon fund that the parents all contributed to). After accepting the money, and receiving an apology from both of the newlyweds I asked if they had the license with them so I could sign it. After signing it and handing it back, the bride and the groom looked up at me and again apologized to me. I told them that it's now all in the past and to enjoy their honeymoon. I don't know how long the marriage will last, nor do I care. They are out of my hair. I did learn a valuable lesson though.

He got me flowers weekly and would often uber eats me Breakfast and coffee in the mornings since I always sleep in and rushing to get to work in the mornings. 6 months ago he proposed to me when we were in Greece and I accepted instantly. I couldn’t believe I found such a sweet, loving, attentive and overall great man. 


Last week I received a DM for Derek’s ex “Samantha” out of the blue. It was shocking. It from a blank profile and I didn’t believe it was her until she video called me and I saw her face. I asked her why is she messaging me from a blank profile and she said she was blocked on my IG account. That was strange because I didn’t block her. Then she sent me screenshots of them still being in a relationship the first few months of our relationship. I couldn’t believe it! I was flabbergasted. I mean full on relationship like still saying I love you and they were even looking at apartments together then one day he just ghosted her. After he convinced her to sign a 2 year lease under her name only because his credit was bad. She also sent me proof of him running up one of her credit cards and not paying it back fully. He still owed her $800. She even told me that she found out that Derek was still in a relationship with his ex fiancé “Amanda” when they got together. I WAS IN SHOCK! I never even knew he was engaged prior to me. He said he had 2 relationships before me, his high school girlfriend and Samantha that’s it. Never any mention of an Amanda or any prior engagements. I thanked her for the information and offered to send her the $800 she declined saying it’s not my job to pay her back. 

I cried my self to sleep that night. I don’t know it just felt like I had been living a lie. This amazing kind man I thought I found wasn’t anything like that. He was a liar and a thief. Not to mention they’ve he spoke to Samantha in those messages after she confronted him when she found out about Amanda was insane. He called her disgusting names and just gaslit her. It was shocking I know I’ve said that before but it was. That night I decided I was done with him. At first I wanted to have a conversation with him but why he’s liar and doesn’t deserve that decency from me. I gave him 3 years and that’s enough of my time. I packed up a 2 suitcase worth of my clothes and called my uncle (who has a moving company) to get the rest of my things and put it in storage. Then I booked a flight to NY to stay at my sisters house. My lease was ending next month anyways and my job is based in NY I just work in the California office so I wrote my manager a request to transfer which I knew would go thru because she offered me a position in the NY office but I wasn’t sure because of my relationship. I know that was dumb never let a relationship stop a work opportunity for you. Lastly I printed out all the screenshots Samantha sent me and put those and the ring in an envelope and dropped it off at his building. 


The last 6 days Derek had been blowing me up from different phone numbers and blank IGs because I blocked him before he even know I broke up with him. Also his friends and family had been reaching out to me and I ignored them. His side is saying I’m an AH. My sister BIL mom and best friends are on my side but a few mutual friends and my dad are saying I’m wrong for just ending it without a conversation. My dad says tho Derek was wrong I should’ve said something to him and leaving him that envelope was the cowards way out. Now idk should I unblock him and have a conversation or just maintain my silence because he knows what he did wrong he just thought I wouldn’t find out about it. So Reddit AITAH?

I usually do 20g grind with 320g water (distilled) on most of my pours. 50g for the bloom followed by 100g pour by another 100g, and then a 70g to finish. I have a Kalita with Kalita KWF185 filters. Usual total brew time around 4 mins. Been finding it to very inconsistent for some reason, even with the same pour every time. Sometimes more bitter, sometimes more sour. I have a K9 ultra set to an 8. So I have started to weigh my actual coffee liquid yield after brewing and found that there are different weights after each pour. Sometimes only 275g total after brewing ranging up to 290g. Obviously the missing water from the 320g poured in is still in the gounds and filter that was thrown away. But does anyone just pour some extra hot water to get back up to 320g total? Can the beans absorb more water sometimes than others even though it's the same grind setting/filter? Can my pouring affect this? Always a circular pour. I have a Stagg EKG pro. My last couple of brews I've just added hot water to get back up to 320g and the taste definitely seems more consistent. But is this because its now ""watered down""? Actually tastes okay for the most part, but maybe next pour ill go to a total of 310g after brew and see how that tastes and adjust total grams from there

i miss him  
i feel guilty

i wish i could forgive and heal 

i have triggers and my body wont/wouldn't relax. my period went missing after the first ambush punch and sadistical holding - he held me while i cried. until he was not mad anymore. i couldnt get over it - my body couldnt. my mind wanted to. parts of me wanted to. i wanted him to get help and fix it. to fix this thing that he did this one time. that i thought could be fixed. that i thought he would take it seriously. 

his inner child cried and i comforted him. that i could do when i am in caregiver mode. i feel his pain was genuine. it was not fake. 

i feel guilty i couldnt heal. not fast enough. not while we shared the living space. not even while we were long distance afterwards. i had to break up with him but it hurt so bad. 

  
on days when i am bitter and resentful i can keep the hurt and grief at bay. but as i heal i remember the good. i remember the mundane yet marvelous moments being together. 

we both have traumas and triggers. we both become callous towards each other when we are projecting and not our true selves.  

  
he tried. he really tried. he took the intense therapy courses and tried. but i feel guilty and heartbroken that i could not heal. i dont even know where to put these words. people are mostly immediately black and white about this. where is the healing. where is the hope. why is there none. why is it so hard to find. why am i so damaged from such a small one time thing. sure he held me down before. sure he threated to kill me if i broke up with him. but i could see it's from the wounded inner child who has abandonment trauma. why are these like forbidden mistakes. why does my heart not heal the way i wish it would. 

i used to be able to just ... still be fine .... with mom and with dad when they hit me. ""out of love"" but i knew the times it was out of frustration coz of their own marital issues. i can't fawn anymore. this is healing they say but i feel so broken. i miss the mornings together. i miss the coffees together. i miss the cooking together. i miss the farmers markets together. we are so lame. but it was so precious. i miss the being together. 

he did everything. he read books on apology and domestic violence. and apologized. but when his hurt innerchild part takes over...he is not himself. i have that too. i know it. i did the reactive abuse thing too. i am not innocent. 

  
once upon a time, when we were still just dating and talking on the phone...i heard him speak angrily to his grandma, and i got triggered. and asked him, ""would you ever hit me if you were mad at me?"" he said, ""you better leave me if i ever hit you"". we felt reassured. and now . i miss that part of us. he wasnt lying. i could feel the truth in his words. he meant what he said. but he didnt know himself. i didnt know myself. we didnt know each other at our worst. 

the more he tried to repair the more i saw him losing himself. he was not himself and i was not myself anymore. it was like ... we trying...holding on to something. but we have changed so much. at least i know i have changed so much. 

i just feel lost. i am not desperate. i dont want rebounds. i just wish i could heal and my body didnt keep the score like this. how long does it take. i dont know. i dont deny the abuse. but i also cant deny the love was real. 

i am empty now. thank you for reading.

1jlbior,https://i.redd.it/c1svtp0u3are1.png,Need Help: Cinnamon Roll Reconstruction Fail,"I started baking cinnamon rolls and doughnuts about a year ago and love it. I'm attempting to reconstruct my favorite cinnamon rolls from a childhood bakery I moved away from years ago. I've failed six times so far and could use any help/suggestions. They have the consistency of a doughnut rather than the bread-like texture of a cinnamon roll. They are very moist and are covered in a light glaze.

The picture is how the cinnamon rolls should turn out. First tried baking a traditional cinnamon roll recipe using bread flour and changing the thickness I roll the dough. That did not work. Next I tried cake flour. Then I tried AP flour. Neither of those worked. Then I got the idea the rolls might be deep fried like a doughnut because of the center line in the picture. Fried doughnuts often have that same center line. So tried a Cake/AP flour mix as well as a bread flour dough and fried the batches in oil. The cinnamon roll filling all fell out while frying and the rolls did not turn out anything like the above picture.

I'm open to any suggestions. I've looked up coffee-roll recipes because they look similar to the picture, but have not found one that turns out remotely like them. Below is the recipe and directions I have been using as a base for the reconstruction.

* Dough Ingredients
   * 4 cups Cake Flour
   * 1 cup sugar
   * 1 tsp salt
   * 2 eggs (room temp)
   * 1/2 cup salted butter
   * 1 cup milk
   * 6 Tbsp vegetable oil
   * 3 tsp active dry yeast
* Filling Ingredients
   * 1 cup salted butter (softened, room temp)
   * 2 cup packed brown sugar
   * 4 Tbsp cinnamon
* Glaze
   * 4 cups powdered sugar
   * 1 tsp vanilla extract
   * 7 Tbsp milk
   * Pinch of salt

1. Make the Dough
   1. Add cake flour, sugar, and salt to a large bowl and mix (4 cups flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp salt)
   2. In another small bowl beat eggs (2 room temp eggs)
   3. In a small pot, melt butter over low heat. Whisk in milk, oil, and beaten egg. Stir constantly until 106F (1/2 cup salted butter, 1 cup milk\*\*\*, 6Tbsp vegetable oil\*\*\*, beaten eggs)
   4. Once 106F (no more than 110F), pour into bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk yeast into mixture. Let it bloom for 10 min. (3 tsp active dry yeast\*\*\*). Reading the back of the yeast container, also calls for 1 tsp sugar when blooming.
   5. Fit mixer paddle attachment and add flout into bowl. Mix on low until just combined.
   6. Switch to dough hook and turn speed to medium high for approximately 12 minutes. Dough is ready when it passes window test (pull at dough and if it spreads thin so you can barely see light through it, it is done)
   7. Spray a large bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Cover with plastic wrap. Proof in refrigerator for 30 minutes. Back of yeast jar says warm place 80-85F. 
2. Make the Filling
   1. In a medium bowl, combine soft butter, brown sugar, cinnamon. Mix with fork (1 cup salted butter, 2 cup brown sugar, 4 Tbsp cinnamon)
3. Prepare the Rolls
   1. Sprinkle work surface with flour. Turn out the dough onto the surface and sprinkle the top of the dough and roller with additional flour. 
   2. Roll the dough into 15”x8” and make sure the dough is 1/2” thick. 
   3. Use a rubber spatula to smooth the cinnamon filling over the whole dough rectangle.
   4. Starting on the long side, roll the dough up tightly, jelly roll style
   5. Measure and cut the roll into 1” slices.
   6. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly spray with nonstick cooking spray.  Place the roll slices on it. Wrap with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 hours.
4. Prepare the Glaze
   1. Mix the powdered sugar, vanilla extract (or maple extract), milk, and pinch of salt in a large bowl by a fork. Mix until very runny. (4 cups powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla|maple extract, 7+ Tbsp of milk, pinch of salt)
5. Frying the Cinnamon Rolls
   1. Pour 2” of oil into Pot a heat until oil is 355F. Adjust your heat to keep the temp between 350-360F while frying. Heat until 360F because adding rolls will lower temperature.
   2. Allow cinnamon rolls to sit at room temperature for 6 minutes before frying (pull several out of refrigerator at a time)
   3. Gently place 3-5 rolls into the fryer. Leave space for them to puff, don’t crowd them.
   4. Once they rise to the surface, cook for 60 seconds and then flip them. Fry for about 45 seconds or until bottom gets golden brown color. Flip it again and fry for another 10-30 seconds or until golden brown color on the other side. 
   5. Transfer to a wire rack set over a sheet pan.
   6. Allow oil to drip off for 10 seconds, then dip them into the glaze. Return to rack to dry.",1,1743101576.0,AskBaking,7,1.0,False
1jlbi7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/2ndStoicSchool/comments/1jlbi7z/how_christianity_was_established_politically_in/,"How Christianity was established politically in the Middle Ages and how neo-liberalism in the same manner was established in our time, or: Ideology-Religion: more powerful the more wrong it is | PSYCHOSOCIAL SCIENCES 101","*Hey valete, rhetorii, I’ll try here to recap a conversation from the other day – what use is learning if it goes no further than a few guys around a coffee table?*

# MAR. II, CAL. APRILIS.

So, the “amazing profundity” of “wow, nearly every single fucking religion or ideology seems to be established upon a colossally obvious (yet various) falsehood or lie or simple moronic error” is something you’ll never hear from anybody these days (even the notion of group competition to steal people away and into their own cult precludes any group from admitting to this – if even they comprehend it), yet it enables our total and complete understanding of our history; how to fathom everything around us today with perfect precision predictive powers; knowing the minds and lives of people before they even know of things themselves, with this simply from having utilized history correctly as to provide prior case studies over the many centuries.

From this, which is fairly broad and widely applicable, we come to fathoming the neo-liberalism of the contemporary West (today: chiefly the EU and NATO); or rather, if we are to be honest, we began as younger people with that in mind, toiled a while finding nothing in contemporary times, and then found no more functional heuristic than this.

As I have made much of: the incredible similarity of “living” Christianity to the contemporary neo-liberalism is entirely astonishing; suppression and hatred of heterosexuality, ruled by a pederast hodgepodge drawn from the worst and practicing (thankfully) dysgenics amongst themselves who essentially have run mad for suppressing their heterosexual impulses, turning sexuality itself into a sin (of which there could be no greater equation for insanity), and above all – chiefly the subject we draw parallels with here – that of a quintessential Nonsense as a binding agent (lat. religare) between disparate states of which directs the activity and culture of a state, internally, into suppression of innovation, industry, intelligence, and so on, for having established irrational precepts and the verbal proclamation of agreement with those irrational precepts as being the habit and character and organizational structure of the culture of the ruling classes and the intelligentsia or technical class or, anyway, the defacto ‘managerial class’ i.e. whomsoever is sitting at the levers of governance whether they comprehend what a lever is or not; considering it as a dildo perhaps.

Again: (which i do not wish to reiterate here but must summarize) “how it is that a person is more completely controlled by ignorance than intelligence?” Obviously he, not wishing to look stupid, will passionately use his own mind to ‘double-down’ for his own sense of pride, make-up reasoning why the nonsense he previously believed in or was conned into believing (which under lie detector conditions it i proven he knows is a lie) is, nevertheless, “completely true,” thus one does not even need to present argument or proof to such a person, as they operate on faith, if a religiously-minded person takes issue with this aspect then I simply ask them: why dos your religion demand you tell lies to maintain your position within it? This can only be the contrary of any serious God as its mode of worship demands Vice and opposes Virtue, and obviously so that all religion is man-made and a social pretense, whether one cares or not to examine the specifics of one religion or another (see: previous on this topic).

Now, it is precisely there that we may only begin in any working manner at all to make sense of the nonsense ideologies of our sorrowful modernity; how it is that outlandish and unscientific social pretense seems to dominate so much the mind of the group and direct the affairs of the world, and how it is that the social habit and political lifestyle remained the same of the West when under Catholic theocracy as to when under neo-liberalism (see: second para above).

Fair question: “it is merely the medium of the society? That the rails as they are laid (e.g. erroneous academic structure) can lead nowhere else (than to idiocy)” I think so, yes, but that is not entirely the point of this topic here.

Rather, therefore, that the constancy of the lies; the disposition created in the person forced to 1) profess nonsense to be Morally Correct (Politically Correct) and, 2) to conduct no inquiry or proof-based assessment of this and to therefore proclaim their Faith; obviously so this is the same form of theocracy as to neo-liberalism; obviously, as well, the Faith is the aspect which impedes correct in the seeking of proofs “yea or nay” for a thing, and obviously “proof” matters nothing at all to this social disposition, which, again: can do nothing but embolden criminality and produce poverty, stagnancy, etc., as the same mentality being true of government councils is true in the Household itself as to block inquiry, enforce irrationality for social pretense and thus to oppose logic, i.e. to hate and distrust Knowledge,

# “(Knowledge itself) of which there is nothing more necessary for the sanity and happiness of Man and Woman,” Emperor Iulianos, paraphrase

Now, the conclusion thus far of our previous entanglement with subjects such as religious oppression of free speech, for instance; as we connect censorship of then and today through the mentality of the censor class or censoring disposition, is that we previously believed – and enacted laws to this end – that it was religion itself which produced these consequences within a mind and endless sectarian war within their societies, thus “freedom of religion” became one of the strongest points of enlightenment culture from the Renaissance Europe and whilst Good it would not ever have thought, I would think, that secular ideologisms which did not anchor themselves to nonsense religions would end up having emulated those religions; as to copy out those religions in every respect of Vice and social evils – or, in another perspective that the same species cannot properly prevent the same characters from rising to dominate them; pederasty, poverty, criminality and the sleep-inducing moral platitudes that serve to silence the corrective impulse of the majority of Men toward such things; of say the American or French or Haitian Revolutions, etc., plainly: it has proven, at the very least, that religion is merely one form of expression of this insanity which manifests not from the stage-prop of a bible or koran or the gaudy Womanish dress of a child-molesting priest but from the simple-minded lack of education, let’s call it that, of a group which in absentia of their faculties of logic, having been suppressed, can but do no better than fall prey to simple rhetoric and logical fallacy, to remain simple-minded and never developing into fully matured Adult Humans from a basis of experience, that is: to retain the child-like conceptions of good and evil, say, not realizing the ‘true evil’ does not present itself as evil but makes great pains to present itself as non-threatening, harmless, innocent, docile, and so on, of which honest persons have no need to undertake such effort and of which, it seems often to follow, only therefore the very worst forms of criminality will do so, thus as like if we are in nature and observe this poison berry killing one of our people once then we learn the lesson that that berry is to be avoided as we have seen with our eyes what it does to consume it.

Again, then, this lesson seems to have taken hold in Renaissance Europe; amongst the French the word for ‘Christian’ gave birth to the word ‘Cretin’, the saying in our own English “you are overly credulous” as to rebuke the sense of ‘faith’ of gullible Housewife, say, who has given away the moneybox in exchange for a worthless piece of paper promising her land in the New World.

But as to fathom, here I mean macro-politically, how our contemporary Europe embraced or, rather: was not educated to avoid (i think certainly deliberately), the real causes and impetus of such things in the group (Demos) and in the psyche (Ourgos) we do best to consider (at last) the title of this text, “how Christianity was established politically in the Middle Ages“ as to examine the precise metrics and dynamics of how it did so with the baseline as easily refutable nonsense of which no learned Roman of either contemporary or a century or so beforehand would have been able to have taken at all seriously, or of which, rather: was the same form of the most cretinous superstition already practiced by the most toothless and filthy living in the gutters around them as worshippers of Dionysus or whomsoever. That is: “nobody could have taken this seriously”, okay, but then what effect did this political ‘oath of loyalty’ actually produce but to render communication between the governing class and the overwhelming majority of persons as no longer possible, as the means to explain, say, industry, agriculture or health no longer existed as it was “demon magic” to be said no more of (again, one cannot avoid the reality that European Academics with careers in Medicine did not believe that washing excrement, bile, blood and vomit from their hands as they went from patient-to-patient was a good idea and instead, so blown up in petty-mined ‘offense’ at the suggestion of this, that actively persecuted the advocate of this as late into history as the very late 1800’s). Then, if the governing class could not communicate Good Ideas; i.e. if they could not engage anymore in scientific proof-based reasoning to discern methods of resolution or plans to move forward on a thing, and also if their culture was the demonize ‘anybody’ who erred from that baseline, then as well as not being able to communicate any longer with the people of a state they could not communicate amongst themselves either, as we recall (or ought) of the end of the Golden Age of science in Islam nobody was able to refute the entirely theologically accurate point made by a fucking moron that “it was no use studying science anymore, because God can change anything whenever he likes” and none could refute this without the charge of heresy being made against them.

To step back, then, from the individual and from the group and focus now on the actual hierarchy as it came to be in the later Middle Ages; this is more complicated perhaps, as we must fathom what the Church ‘was’ in its bricks and mortar and streams of revenue, that is: how it came to own and steal away some 80% of the revenue of England, taking the money overseas, in the years prior to Henry Tudors dissolution of it. In form, as it was, it retained the legal mandate of the Pagan Roman Curate which was the economic wing, if you like, of the Roman Government; the money was to finance the vast Legions but obviously the Legions had not existed for almost a thousand years; likewise the Church were not doing anything with this money, not building useful things, not maintaining public water systems or sewage systems which did not exist either, nor hospitals (although ramshackle largely on the initiative of local persons were tolerated), nor putting on paid festivals and fun games for 200 days in the year. It was, then, nothing more than an embezzlement scheme.

To understand “why it is” that people today cannot actually make sense of government profligacy to steer-better their society; to avoid foolish wars and errors in policy, it seems to me to be an inevitable and necessary conclusion that it is this same refusal to disseminate the truth of what the Church was with tens of thousands of case studies all to this end, that therefore, as I have said often, one cannot understand lunacy in ideology today without understanding the history of it in prior religions either as one has no case studies to make sense of a thing today without doing precisely that; e.g. the paradox is this: that Christians or Muslims considers themselves breaking away from a corrupt society, in their inclination to do so they are entirely correct, but they do not realize that they merely exchange one flavour of pepsi cola for another to have adopted earlier iterations of the same psychosocial impulses that cause them to shirk back from and look upon with contempt; consider the early Christian movement, all of its obvious lies and fantasies, as being no more than the new testament; or that a Jeffrey Epstein or any known scoundrel today, of which it is claimed were “persecuted for no reason” were in fact persons well known to us who well-deserved to be nailed to planks of wood and left to dangle, for their crimes which will not be mentioned in the histories written by the deluded – and we may assume this to be a fair reasoning indeed because this is the story of St Paul himself hounded by the Jews (i.e. the first followers Jesus) who “tried to kill him for his faith!” rather than his lifetime of hunting and killing rebellious Jewish Christians for his previous employer.

My point here is that as such things are obvious one cannot help but recognize the various religious or ideologies or whatever else which form like mould on a discard carcass for having been established, by necessity of their own foundations upon error and lies, known and obvious and so demanding propaganda to obfuscate it, as being entirely constructs which bend the mind toward social evil for having established a disposition so hostile toward wisdom – in the name, eventually, of political expediency.

Now it is “political expediency” where we arrive back at the observation that “religion-ideology is merely social pretense” in that most persons involved privately admit they know their proclamations are total nonsense but insist upon making the proclamations in public or anyway avoiding bettering themselves, in the case of the EU and NATO we find more obviously a culture of complete fantasy holding the thing in place to no real purpose and which provokes endless enmity in order to maintain itself, first of all at the domestic-national level to crush state autonomy; as most people gain nothing from being bound to it and any critique of policy or wish to suggest better policy was cast as moral heresy and treated with violence, and then at the international level where the beast of thing assumes its form in the eyes of the rest of the world in endless wars, endless plundering, moral platitude again but no real help to dig a village well, the return to racism despite the domestic enforcement of anti-racism; that wild-eyed dog-mad paradox of affairs that if one were to cheer the bombing of Muslims (i mean: by British or Dutch military planes) during the Iraq War that one would be convicted of a crime …. how, then, can such a dissonant culture maintain itself? This is no more ‘dissonant’ than to recall how a religion of peace with a messiah figure who was executed before a mob in a grizzly fashion for the crime of blasphemy went on themselves to wage wars and execute countless persons before a mob in a grizzly fashion for the crime of blasphemy – that is to say that even the most simple and obvious lessons we might think would transfer through the skull plating of a Man or Woman failed to do so at any point, that is, then: that it is not the content of religion, not necessarily anyway, which moves persons to do what they do and, if I seem to lightening up on my attitude toward religion, I mean to indict it all the more that the ‘verbal content’ proves incapable either of correcting those slavish behaviours and so the thing possesses not even small merit in that regard.

# How then can such a dissonant culture maintain itself?

It is the shared proclamation, the public show of knowingly false belief, which is the matter to examine at this juncture; to acquiesce to a nonsense, or: as Voltaire wrote, “to believe (or pretend to believe) in an absurdism in order to commit atrocity,” though I fancy Voltaire did not quite hit the nail on the head in his day in regard to realizing that any belief in an irrationality or any unproven thing is itself an impossibility which is, then, simply the self-debasement of a person by the espousal of a lie; indicting of themselves a malleable, sycophantic and criminally-servient character who will “do anything (no matter how lowly or foolish)”. As it is the shared proclamation; this self-incrimination, which presents itself as a constancy in the demands made of a profligate class in order to extend some of their authority upon a Quisling who wishes to serve them as a junior accomplice.

One may well imagine this in the Middle Ages that a community, perhaps so broken by endless abuse, come to embrace The Ideology and have all sorts of hope (read: Pandora) that “if we just believe, then the master will take pity on us,” only then for their new master to be revealed; twisted form emerging from a carriage, decked in pomp, to proclaim that up is down and night is day, what a blow this would be intellectually to a people to realize that it is just more of the same, unchanged, and this, in the Middle Ages, despite having just buried their ancestral customs held by them since the dawn of time.

It is not much different, or even at all different, to the promulgation of neo-liberalism; merely a veneer for the directionless rudderless rapacity of plunder capitalism, as it spread across the world, was opposed naturally, seemed then to be on the retreat but then came back in its old ways under rainbow flags and with lofty yet hollow proclamations of peace and equality.

As like the Spaniards in the Americas or the Portuguese in the Orient, these dogs; craven louse-infested outcasts from their own homelands, followed their slavish impulses to rape and eat until they burst, and their ideologues followed behind him, totem in hand and platitude at the ready; to recast as like BBC World Service propagandists the crimes of the aggressor as not crimes at all and the culture and actions of aggressed-against as being fundamentally ‘morally’ unrighteous, always at the ready to repeat usually the same one story that serves in their own mind to justifies their barbarous enmity, differing not even at all from, say, the party political statements of the various jihadists, knowing that the messaging of ‘peace and love (and moralism)’ strikes the most artistic contrast to the raw brutality of their own feral monkey-like escapades as they tear the limbs from the babies of other tribes and hoot around in the treetops.

Indeed, what we are looking at really in these instances, I think, is the mind of the 'actual' criminal; the true criminal I mean who is guilty of heinous actions, who is still running from his or her contrition; in the case of religion it is more obvious than secular ideologies that the criminal espousing they have mended their ways only to persist in the precise same activities, often even do far more worse things, is more obviously a destitute creature who belongs upon the plank of wood, that is: to have compound their unlearned, lavish and primitive disposition of lusting for petty vice by pretending one day to be “one with God” “because (of) Belief (in a book),” that is: rather than truly be contrite over past errors to instead hector and abuse others - who never were guilty of their own depths of depravity, that the same is true of the seculares as well; barely even concealed I think, albeit that their verbal utterances differ that their action and disposition is nonetheless entirely the same.

Perhaps this point in particular may wash over the head of the reader so I must add here, to expound upon an elusive concept to you, this: “the mind of the criminal … is still running from his or her contrition,” that we might make sense of this as being the expected product of the religious background; if not ‘actually’ raised in the religion then lingering anyway in a culture half-saturated by those more irrational precept of it; “heterosexuality is a sin” for instance, for having still effectively retained the mental chains over the individual and largely through their society itself, coming to them from various societal chain-sequences, so that they are, as it were, lingering on the cusp of some revelation regarding this thing or that thing or another, something, I mean to say more plainly here, that would require of them to unlearn the dysfunctionality which has come into their character and of which they do not wish to do, hence: they run from ‘true’ contrition as to observe of “true contrition” to result in actual diametric changes from one approach of a thing to another approach of the same thing, which we do not observe in the examples of this in the religious; where the slavering dog child-rapist pretends to be a holy zealot one day to avoid being butchered in the public square and then persists in the same or worse criminality within the sanctuary of religion that sent him fleeing into sanctuary to begin with, that in short: is it that the motivation of a such a person who becomes the Moralist, as it were, is that to have engaged in a process of short reflection of their own activities but where the lesson would enter into their head to actually not do the evil things anymore, to become better than they were, that this lesson instead is bounced away; like incoming fire against reactive armour plating, and dispersed instead upon “all mankind”.

I mean to say, that is: that the impulse for “hollow moralism”, as in the character of it, is fundamentally suspect and is (to use the proper word) engaging in transference - at the very least, and, at the very worst: from recent and prior examples seems always to in fact be the very worst person around.

Then: with this Moralist posturing; this infantilising platitude, we observe the dissonance of the mind of the speaker of such things, this tells us of their character and lifestyle of which enables us to fathom them quite deeply indeed to predict, almost, their logistical capacity and maximal trajectory or possible outcomes, and so on, in short: that they are wretched dogs who are entirely worthless and are the most criminally liable for anything, being capable from the barrenness of their intellect (or soul, if you prefer), to be as like on the cusp of heinous criminality of which most Men and Women would not, I think, be capable or ever be inclined to perpetrate, and that this is entirely from the flight from contrition; the rejection of self-betterment to have drowned themselves, as like a full baptism, into the waters of fantasy and delusion so as to have recast themselves and their crimes as being not crimes at all.

This shared delusion, or “mass psychosis” as Wilhelm Reich wrote of it - albeit with him a little on the peripheral to our subject here, cannot – despite that the reader may wish to – be ignored as to the massive and total effect it produces within and upon a society; as to the sheer number of persons affected (as in: most of us are forced to contend with those possessed of it even if we are not possessed of directly themselves) by this ‘disposition’ as to account for the totality of an otherwise seemingly mutually opposed political landscape of this party versus that party or this cult versus that cult; as again we are talking about the same mentality which animates this disposition with the great social enmity or schismatic nonsense drama being the form taken by this mentality of persons – to say nothing here of the mental imbalance observed of those who ‘seek out’ recognition in the media in the first place (a thing observed since the 1960’s, and synonymous with SPS in Soviet Psychiatry), and again: notice how this “chattering class” ‘absolutely’ propels into oblivion upon oblivion ‘our’ society whilst ‘always’ making, of their habit and total activity, the pursuit and abuse and silencing of any logical voices of correction toward their cretins fantasy – no matter what it may be from one epoch to the next, and indeed: it matters not even at all.

1jlbhbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jlbhbn/how_a_letter_changed_everything_at_my/,How A Letter Changed Everything At My Bachelorette Party,"All names, ages, and locations have been changed. I apologize for the length, but it deserves the length it's getting:  
  
I (F24) got married to my husband (M27) back in January, and we just got all of our pictures back from our photographer. They are the most beautiful pictures I have ever seen, and as I flipped through them, I came across some shots of me with one of my bridesmaids—Grace, a friend from high school. That’s when I found myself taking a trip down memory lane.

Grace and I have known each other since kindergarten, but all through school, I never really had a solid friend group. I was always the outsider. I wasn’t a genius, but I was in the top 10 of my class and loved learning. I was involved in theatre, ran cross country and track, did ballet, and loved going to football games with my dad. I didn’t fit into just one category—I wasn’t fully a jock, a nerd, or an artist. I was all of the above, and because of that, I didn’t belong anywhere and got bullied heavily because of it.

I was never invited to parties. I didn’t go to homecoming because my so-called “friend group” told me I wasn’t invited. I wasn’t in any group chats. I was always the last one chosen for group projects. On the weekends, I hung out with my sisters and parents or read my books. I was a loner.

One of my favorite teachers noticed this and invited me to join the debate team he had just started. I had always been interested, so I agreed. The first year, I was the only girl among seven of the nerdiest guys you could imagine, and I loved it! We would meet before school, research fascinating topics, and debate about what was “morally permissible.” That year, we made it to the final round and placed second in our very first competition!

The next year, something unexpected happened. Grace—one of the only people who would occasionally talk to me—decided to join the debate team too. She had heard about how much I enjoyed it, and she gave it a shot. That year, we placed first in the final round. More importantly, though, I felt like I finally had someone I could talk to.

We weren’t inseparable, but she was there. And after graduation, when I lost touch with everyone else, Grace and I kept in contact. When I met my now-husband, I knew I wanted her as a bridesmaid. Even if we weren’t the absolute closest, she was part of my childhood, and as someone deeply nostalgic who cherishes the details of storytelling, it was important to me that she be there.

Which brings me to my bachelorette party.

The night was perfect! We all wore black dresses (another long story for another time), and we started with dinner at a beautiful Italian restaurant. My girls totally surprised me with everything, and I felt so incredibly celebrated. After dinner, we went to my sister’s house, where we had an assortment of beverages (yes, the alcoholic kind—it was a party!) and played games.

At one point, my maid of honor handed me a scrapbook. Inside were pictures of me with each of my bridesmaids at different stages of my life. But the part that truly undid me? Each of my six bridesmaids had written a letter, filled with memories we had shared and what I meant to them.

Naturally, I was crying. It was all so sentimental and overwhelming in the best way.

And then, I got to Grace’s letter. And I completely fell apart.

In a part of her letter, she of course congratulated me and exclaimed her excitement of the wedding. It was in this paragraph that she gifted me peace. She wrote:

""... I'm sure you might understand the feeling of knowing you weren't going to find all your people in \[Name of Small Town\]. For me, I had the mindset of just 'survive and advance.' I'd find some people who were okay enough to hang out with for a few years and then find my REAL people in college. I didn't think I would really stay in contact with anyone and was okay with that. Then, you told me about a club Mr. Teacher was running. I joined and we started to hang out in the mornings before school. We'd talk about it at lunch and in our free time and slowly but surely, I felt like we were becoming really good friends. Not just friends you have out of convenience like most of my other friends in school, but real friends. It was huge how important that was (and still is) to me. Suddenly, I felt like maybe there were a few people from school that I should keep around. I found someone who I could talk about more than just drinking or parties with. Everything from politics to philosophy to the arts and sports was fair game when it came to us.... Every year, I've looked forward to our coffee/lunch dates over our breaks from school to catch up on life. We really can talk for hours and hours! You have been such a good friend to me, especially in high school when I needed one the most. You've always been someone who just 'gets it' and I'm so grateful and blessed to have you in my life...""

Her letter healed something in me.

All those years I spent feeling alone, feeling like I had no real friends, feeling like I was just surviving high school—she was right there with me the whole time. And I hadn’t even realized it. For so long, I felt like a ghost with unfinished business.

In that moment, I felt all the memories of our friendship rush back, washing over the loneliness I had carried for so long. Memories I forgot that were clouded by the negative experiences. The moments I had overlooked, the kindness I had minimized, the connection that had always been there—I could finally see it clearly.

She had been my friend all along. A real friend.

And now, I don’t just think I have friends—I know I do. I know I always did. And I have never felt more at peace. It was the best gift I have ever received, and I am so thankful for her friendship. I never thought it was possible to reach catharsis, but through tears and tight hugs, I happily stand corrected.",9,1743101480.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

2 Kansai-Hiroshima Area Pass - $223.76  
*A lot of people will tell you to book your tickets in person but I am extremely happy to not follow that advice. Each Shinkansen we got in was extremely packed and even booking the tickets a week prior we saw that a lot of the seat selections was already taken. We DID NOT USE KLOOK, we used the official SmartEX app and paired our Apple Wallet Sucia cards to our Shinkansen tickets. Which allowed us to tap and go – only possible with SmartEX to my knowledge. I also noticed that Klook was more expensive than SmartEX. For the Kansai Pass, we also booked the seats a week prior and got the tickets along with the Area Pass when we picked it up in Kyoto.*

**Day 0, Monday: Seattle to Asakusa -**

***From the ANA Flight Review:***  
I didn't get on the Pikachu plane Sadly. This was my first international flight ever and the first time being on a plane this big (three rows wowed me) I was honestly shocked by how much space economy had compared to US domestic flights. Though, on the way back, I realized that space disappears fast when people actually recline their seats—something the passengers in front of us did not do on the way there.

***Airport to Hotel:***  
I chose Asakusa for the first night because of the direct train from the airport and its relatively close distance to Tokyo Station. Since we had one day in Tokyo to settle in and do some pre-trip shopping, this made things easier.

Finding the right train line at Terminal 3 was a bit confusing. We found the ticket machine but kept walking down a pair of escalators, which was clearly wrong. Turns out, the turnstiles were right next to the ticket machine, but we missed them because a huge crowd of people was blocking the view. Thankfully, we had Suica pre-loaded on Apple Wallet, so it was just a tap-and-go situation (though I struggled to find where to my tap phone at first—a nice person helped me out).

We got off near Asakusa Station and took a short walk through the temple to our hotel, which was absolutely gorgeous at night. Checked into Onyado Nono Asakusa Natural Hot Spring, dropped off our luggage, grabbed the free hotel noodles, and immediately went to Donki to stock up on snacks. Ended the night with a soak in the onsen and a Lawson egg sando, which we *did not not* Like because of a weird mustard taste.

**Day 1, Tuesday: Asakusa, Ueno –**

I woke up an hour earlier than my girlfriend each day for some solo exploration, which worked out great for grabbing cash and a pre-breakfast snack. First stop: Feb's Coffee, where I finally got to try Japanese flan. It's a bit different from the Cuban flan I grew up with—more watery and jello-like.

Sensoji Temple – Holy shit. We absolutely loved this place. The whole experience—we did the full experience with the proper hand cleansing to the incense ritual and prayer—was super fun and immersive. We did omikuji (fortune slips), and I somehow pulled the best possible fortune (so obviously, I didn't do another fortune the rest of the trip LOL). My girlfriend, on the other hand, got the second-worst fortune which meant she had to tie hers down. We picked up some charms afterward—she got a bell for luck, and I grabbed a cool transparent blue one from the smaller temple next to Sensoji.

We strolled down Nakamise Street, which wasn't too busy, but a lot of the stalls were selling mass-produced junk, and some of the food vendors seemed kinda sketchy. However, we stumbled across Kibidango Azuma, and wow—soybean flour mochi shocked me with how good it was\*.\* Absolutely loved it, wish I had gotten more. Big fan of soybean flour.

At the end of the market, we went up to the Asakusa Culture Tourist Center Observation Terrace for a great panoramic view of the area. From there, we walked through the back streets to Nishi-Sando where we tried the viral melonpan and Giraffa Asakusa curry—both underwhelming. This kinda killed our appetite, so we skipped lunch and headed to Ueno early.

Before leaving Asakusa, I stopped by the hotel to grab our checked bag and planned to take it to a nearby Yamato store, but the front desk told me they could handle it for me instead—huge win, saved me time.

By the time we arrived, the weather started getting gloomy and drizzly, so we browsed some shops before strolling through Ueno Park. Came across some cool spots, like mini torii gates and a small temple. Originally, we planned to check out the National Museum, but we were too excited to keep exploring and decided to skip it. Looking back, I kinda regret that, since the weather got worse, and we didn't enjoy Ueno as much because of it(We didnt have an umbrella).

We ducked into Uniqlo/GU So I could grab a few basic items. Highly recommend the seamless boxers—so comfy and way better priced than in the US. The Uniqlo building also had a food court on the top floor, so we decided to rest our feet and get out of the rain. Unfortunately, BOTEJYU Okachimachi was a total miss—my okonomiyaki and highball were mid at best, which sucked considering there were much better food options nearby.

***Asakusa Hotel Review – Onyado Nono Asakusa Natural Hot Springs: 8/10***  
Super fun hotel, and the free noodles was shockingly good. The whole ""take off your shoes at the lobby"" thing was cool at first, but the novelty wore off when I forgot something in the room or just wanted to step out for a second. Also, I was constantly paranoid about ruining the tatami mats. The queen-size room was spacious enough, and the onsen was great—though having some random tourists try to chat with me while I was trying to relax was awkward. That said, everyone followed the showering rules properly, which (as I later found out) wasn't always the case throughout my trip.

**Day 2, Wednesday: Nara (omizutori fire festival)–**

We had a bullet train scheduled for 7:30 AM to Kyoto, so we started the day early and checked out around 6 AM. Originally, I planned to use Uber to hail a taxi, but luckily, there was one waiting right outside the hotel. In the worst Japanese possible, I asked, ""Tokyo Station okay?"" “Card okay?” Which made the driver laugh. He got us there with 40 minutes to spare.

We considered getting ekibens, but we love our western carb-heavy breakfast, so we opted for McDonald's at the station instead. Of course, we had to try all the limited-edition breakfast items they had.

Navigating Tokyo Station wasn’t an issue since I had already marked the exact platform we needed and confirmed it using Navitime app. (Google Maps was unreliable and often failed to find the exact train.) Also, I highly recommend this [PiQtour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht2I2_SU2fQ&t=44s), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht2I2\_SU2fQ&t=44s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht2I2_SU2fQ&t=44s) which made getting to the platform a breeze. We boarded and realized that we were the only foreigners in the cabin. What really shocked me was how Quiet The train was – I loved it.

Along the way, the clouds parted just long enough for us to catch a glimpse of Mt. Fuji! It reminded me a lot of Washington's Mt. Rainier. The 2-hour, 30-minute ride flew by—I was glued to the window the entire time.

Once we arrived at Kyoto Station, we picked up our Kansai-Hiroshima Area Pass first. That turned out to be a smart move since, since the line moved very slow and grew. I felt bad for the staff because it seemed like everyone was giving them a hard time. When I got up to the counter, I simply handed over my printed reservations, and they quickly processed everything, handed me our passes, and explained how to use them.

While picking up my pass at the same counter, I noticed the exclusive Astro Boy sakura ICOCA IC card and picked one up for the novelty. The card itself was $5, but you’re required to load it with $25, making the total $30. I didn’t use it for transit but instead spent the $25 on a split purchase at the Nintendo Store later in the trip.

From there, we walked over to the Mitsui Garden Hotel next to the station. One of the main reasons I picked this hotel chain was their bag shipping service—if you’re staying at another Mitsui Garden location, they’ll send your luggage ahead for only $5 per bag. So, we handed over our bags, which were sent directly to Mitsui Garden Hotel Shinmachi Bettei, where we’d be staying later that night.

Now bagless, we took the Kintetsu Limited Express to Nara for the deer park and the Omizutori Fire Festival. It was a bit confusing at first, but a kind station worker literally walked us through the whole process—helping us buy tickets and even guiding us to the correct train. We were blown away by the level of service and waved a huge thanks as we boarded. The limited express was well worth the small price, getting us to Nara in 30 minutes and much closer to the park than the JR station.

The restaurant I had planned for lunch was closed, likely due to the festival, so we grabbed some konbini food instead. On the way, I stumbled across a shop selling Tabis which were made in Japan and impulse-bought a pair.

At the park, we made a quick stop at Kōfuku-ji before heading to Kasuga-taisha Shrine. Along the way, we got deer biscuits and were immediately Attacked by the near by deer, which forced us to buy more. We had to hide them until we got further in, where the deer actually bowed before taking the food. The ones near the entrance were way more aggressive, probably because most tourists don't know you're supposed to bow first and just handed over the biscuits.

When we reached Kasuga-taisha Shrine, we were a little disappointed to find the main lantern attraction roped off. It seemed like a special event was happening — there were young men in white kimonos alongside the priests, possibly something related to the Omizutori festival? Even so, the walk there was relaxing and gorgeous. (A bit muddy due to the rain, avoid white sneakers!)

From there, we took a different path through Nara Park toward Tōdai-ji, passing a small street lined with shops. Most were closed, but we grabbed some egg sandos from 若草山パレット, - solid 7/10, much-needed fuel.

Tōdai-ji itself was just as epic as I imagined. Photos do not Do the Great Buddha justice—it's Massive. We spent so much time just walking around in awe. I had completely forgotten this was also the temple with the enlightenment pillar hole! Watching people squeeze through was fun, and the crowd was cheering for everyone. My girlfriend and I both managed to do it—it’s a lot harder than it looks!

After that, we did short hiked up to Tōdai-ji Nigatsu-dō, the main viewing area for the Otaimatsu torch-burning ceremony. We arrived around 5:15 PM and secured a good spot in line. The crowd was sizable but mostly locals. The festival started around 7:40 PM with a short explanation in Japanese, follow by Korean, Chinese and English. Then, everything went dark as they lit the torch and carried it to the corner of the temple. Groups were allowed to walk underneath it, though we were kept at a bit of a distance, and the police were managing the crowd quickly. The whole process of walking underneath took less than a minute, but it was still fun! I just wish I had brought a small book to read while waiting—or had a better eSIM. (My girlfriend, who used Chris Abroad's eSIM, had no issues, while mine wasn't loading anything.)

After the festival, we were funneled out of the park and ended up on an bus that had just arrived to Kintetsu-Nara Station. The trip back took a while, requiring a transfer to the Kintetsu Kyoto Line and then a local train (K) to our hotel.

**Day 3, Thursday: Kyoto (Philosopher path, Gion, Fushimi Inari) -**

I ended up swapping my onsen time to the morning, highly recommend it if you want to basically have it all to yourself—it was a great way to start the day. For our full stay in Kyoto, we opted for the hotel breakfast package during booking. This ended up being a great decision, as we got to try several different traditional Japanese morning dishes, along with a buffet of other items. I discovered that I am a HUGE oden fan—oden rocks, and it was such a highlight of my Kyoto mornings.

After breakfast, we requested a ride through Uber to Philosopher's Path. I was on the fence about the path, as it was still winter/early spring and there was no foliage. However, the moment we got off, we got distracted by a small shopping street leading up to Higashiyama Jisho-ji. We got a matcha cream puff at Ginkakuji Matsubaya, and it was 10/10. When we reached the entrance of Higashiyama, I decided we should check this place out, and I’m glad I did instead of walking the path. The garden was stunning, and it was so much fun walking around. We easily spent 40 minutes taking it all in.

Once we finished, we saw a stand for sugar covered strawberries and dango to try. Ended up liking the taste of the dango with the brown syrup on top. It was much savorier than I expected.

As we didn't plan to walk the whole Philosopher's Path, we decided to make a trek to Mo-an Café. It was quite the hike up the hill, but extremely fun looking at all the Kyoto houses and smaller shrines. Once we got to Mo-an, I was taken aback by the atmosphere. It's a great hidden place, but know that it's extremely quiet and tranquil — so much so so that it was jarring when a group of other travelers waiting outside was speaking so loudly you could hear it inside. Once we finished, we headed back down towards Yoshida Shrine, another large, gorgeous shrine with a priest doing his prayers.We hailed a taxi and made our way towards the iconic Sannenzaka spot.

**Pro Tip:** Download the “Go” app prior to your trip for taxis. But if you mess up like me and notice the app requires a text confirmation, use your parents' or a friend's phone number and have them them provide you the message, since your eSIM won't have a phone number.

We had our taxi drop us off at Kodaiji Park, which is a great tip since it’s super close to the iconic area but easy for the taxi to pull up with its parking lot. I was nervous about this spot because online it's painted as an 'overtourism' hellscape. What I found instead was a busy shopping street filled with fun shops, including a small Ghibli store I didn't even know was there! However, I found the Ghilbi store at Diver City to have a larger variety of items, whereas the Kyoto one has a smaller offering. We went into the iconic Starbucks, rested for a few minutes, and then went back out for more sightseeing, heading towards Kiyomizu-dera. I think my experience with larger crowds made me think it was not much different from visiting Disney World during peak seasons.

Once we got to Kiyomizu-dera, I was taken aback by its beauty. This was 100% the busiest temple we went to during the whole trip, but everyone was nice enough to continue moving along, so it was easy to look over the ledge and take pictures. I noticed when we got to the three streams of Otowa, a lot of people didn't know what they were looking at or doing. Ironically, I had played ""Go! Go! The Nippon! My first trip to Japan” and a school field trip confirmed that one each of the waterfalls represented school achievement, fulfillment in love, and longevity. We both went with longevity. It was fun seeing all the kids do the school achievement one.

Finishing up at Kiyomizu-dera and Sannenzaka, I honestly wished I’d spent more time in the area. You could easily spend a full day shopping and exploring this area but having just a few hours was still a lot of fun.

We took another taxi to our final site for the day: Fushimi Inari Shrine. We had a dinner reservation at a restaurant right next to it, at Itsukichaya Fushimiinari. Exploring the shrine during 'blue hour' was a blast. We walked in for a few moments to thin out the crowds and took a bunch of pictures. It was such a gorgeous place to see during sunset, as the lanterns gave it an awesome vibe. I would 100% come back to Fushimi Inari during my next trip.

Once we finished, it was time for our reservation, and we enjoyed a large 5-bowl, yummy beef shabu set. It was upstairs overlooking the forest, which was an awesome way to finish the day.

Instead of taxiing back, we decided to take the near by metro down to the Nintendo Store to catch the last hour it was open. Then we learned that Japan has taxi stops-Basically, a bunch of taxis line up, and you just grab the first one. It's an easy way to get home quickly afterwards.

**Day 4, Friday: Himeji -**

This day marked our first 'Day Trip' using our pass. Originally, we had planned to go to Osaka, but since this won’t be our only trip to Japan, I decided to make the most of the pass we got because of Hiroshima. One challenge, though, was needing to get to Shin-Osaka each day. This became tricky the first time, as we couldn't find the limited express for the life of us. Even though we were at the platform, we ended up missing it twice because Google Maps gave us serious doubts. We should have stuck to what I had on my Excel sheet. I’d advise using NaviTime over Google for station trips, as Google can sometimes suggest completely different routes. Still, we made it to Shin-Osaka in plenty of time for our short Shinkansen to Himeji. *(Ideally however this pass should be used if you are staying in Osaka vs Kyoto as it doesn't cover the Shinkasen route from Kyoto -> Osaka - I knew this but already had my hotel booked so we just dealt with it. However I do not recommend taking far daytrips from Kyoto, just not worth spending the extra hour.)*

We booked a free tour through i-guide [https://i-guide.jpn.org/](https://i-guide.jpn.org/), which pairs you with a Japanese local learning English. I wouldn’t recommend this if you’re introverted or if you expect the best guide experience. It's very casual, and I ended up helping to help our tour guide learn some new English words to describe things. The tour was quite long—we spent pretty much the entire day with our guide. You’re supposed to buy their lunch, but he insisted on paying for ours instead! I had packed an omiyage (small gift) to give at the end so I got the favor back haha. He took us to a small local okonomiyaki spot, and it was 20 times better than what we had in Ueno.

After eating, we visited the garden by Himeji Castle, which was pretty, but since it was still winter/early spring, there was not much foliage. We got along so well with our tour guide that he offered to give us a tour of Kobe next time we come, and to spend more time with us.

Afterwards, we explored Himeji's small shopping area before heading back to our accommodation to rest up for our next day trip.

**Day 5, Saturday: Hiroshima -**

This day was the most straightforward and mainly spent traveling. The only goal for the day was to visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, as my partner had always wanted to go. We really enjoyed the experience, but I would recommend staying the night if possible. We didn’t mind losing most of the day (it was nice to reset our feet), but a better plan would have been to spend the following day exploring Hiroshima(Which didn't fit into our schedule).

We had breakfast at New York New York in Hiroshima, a cute little café, before heading to the memorial. We spent a couple of hours there, taking it slow and reading everything. While we loved the Memorial, we were disappointed by how tiny and cramped it was. The layout was not great, and with the number of people, it took forever to see anything. Additionally, there were some tourists behaving in poor taste, taking selfies and giving thumbs up—extremely disrespectful.

Originally had planned to take a taxi to the memorial and back but found taking the surface tram worked out great.

**Day 6, Sunday: Kyoto ( Arashiyama, kinkaku-ji, Nishiki Market) -**

This day had a few changes from what I had originally planned due to the weather, as it was rainy. We ended up spending more time walking around Arashiyama and skipped the Monkey Park since we didn't want to trek up a potentially muddy path. We also shipped out our checked bags to our next hotel with the help of the hotel's front desk.

Our taxi driver dropped us off at a side/end section of the Arashi Bambooyama Forest, which left us a bit confused as there wasn’t anyone around. It could have been the weather keeping people away, but the crowd level was very manageable. I wasn’t that impressed with the forest—it could have been the weather though.

Once we finished taking a few pictures, we explored Arashiyama itself, which was gorgeous. We stopped by a few shops and picked up some yummy treats. After spending a few hours in the area, we took a taxi to Kinkaku-ji.

We probably got extremely lucky with the bad weather, as Kinkaku-ji was also less crowed. The weather started clearing up, so we got some awesome pictures. This temple was a really fun place to explore and walk around. It took less than an hour to really take it all in. Right before the exit, we saw they were offering a tea experience for only 500 yen. We decided to give it a try, and it was such a cheap and fun experience with matcha and a gold-flake treat. I will 100% recommend it.

Next, we took another taxi to Nishiki Market, where we tried a few things on my list. I felt that there were a lot of overpriced items at the market compared to other stalls I had seen throughout the day. The most memorable were Kyo no Onikudokoro and まるもち家 錦小路店. Highly recommend both—they were well-priced and offered a great experience.

We spent the rest of the day shopping and eating around Nishiki Market. While it was busy, it wasn't much different the crowd levels of Pike Place Market. I was shocked by the sheer number of retail stores in Nishiki. I wish we had more time to step into each one!

**Day 7, Monday: Uji (Nintendo Museum) –**

Check-out day and the last day of our Kyoto hotel breakfast. I didn't realize just how much I was going to miss having breakfast at the hotel. It was a great way to get all the energy I needed to start the day. I'll probably consider doing more Japanese breakfast add-ons in the future. We shipped our carry-on bags to the Mitsui Garden hotel next to the station so we could pick them up when we returned from Uji.

The primary focus of the day was the Nintendo Museum and exploring Uji, time permitting. We ended up getting to Uji earlier than expected—about an hour before anything opened—so we had time to check out Byodoin Temple. It was a fun little stroll, and the museum inside the area was cool. Afterward, we had matcha dessert and drinks at Nakamura Tokichi Byodo-in, which was soooo good.

With 30 minutes to spare, we headed over to the Nintendo Museum, just one stop and a short walk from Uji. We had an absolute blast at the museum. We did the shopping first because we were worried things would sell out (which, in hindsight, was kind of silly, as nothing sold out). We spent $250 on shirts and a large Wii controller plush (the packable duffle fit the Wii controller without any issues). They recommend doing the interactive games first, and I totally agree. We did the museum first, and when we got to the interactive games, there were no lines. However, by the time we finished, the game section was packed, and huge lines had formed. We spent our coins on the batting cages a couple of times, then played the Wii controller mini-games and Mario Kart on the N64. I 100% recommend the batting cages—so much fun!

We also signed up for the Hanafuda cards lesson, which was AWESOME! We were the only foreigners, but the staff was super kind in helping us get started. I loved Hanafuda so much that I ended up picking up a deck later in the trip.

Afterward, we headed back to Kyoto Station with some time to spare to pick up bentos and our checked bags. The ride to Tokyo Station went smoothly, even though it was another packed Shinkansen. From there, we rode another line at Tokyo Station to Shinjuku. Super easy, just following the station signs and the platform listed on Google to our next Hotel.

***Kyoto Hotel Review – Mitsui Garden*** ***Shinmachi Bettei : 9/10***  
Originally, we had planned to stay at another Mitsui Garden Hotel, nicknamed the ""temple hotel"" next to Nishiki Market. However, due to construction, they rebooked us at this sister hotel. While the location wasn't the best, everything else was amazing. Great customer service, an amazing room, a wonderful breakfast, and a great onsen with plenty of shower stalls and grooming amenities. I was super impressed with the Mitsui Garden chain and will be staying at their sister hotels in the future.

**Day 8, Tuesday: Harajuku, Shibuya ( Shibuya Sky ), Shinjuku -**

The day started with an onsen in the morning, and I was really glad I stuck with morning onsens at this hotel. My girlfriend, who did the Onsen at night, had some wild experiences. I even made a Reddit post about how hotel guests completely ignored onsen etiquette. The hotel didn’t have much explanation compared to my previous stays, so I wasn’t surprised people didn’t know the rules.

After coming from our spacious Kyoto hotel room, this double twin room felt even smaller than the one in Asakusa and was incredibly dusty. Honestly, I kind of hated this hotel from the get-go, which soured my Tokyo experience.

We started the day with breakfast in Harajuku at Honolulu Coffee. It was good, but crazy expensive for what we got compared to Kyoto, and I later realized that food in Kyoto was much cheaper than in Tokyo—at least that’s how it felt to me.

We then strolled down to Meiji Jingu and enjoyed the peaceful scenery, killing time until most stores opened at 11 AM. Once they did, we walked down the iconic street, stopping by a few pre-planned shops.

Getting to Shibuya was quick and easy, and the station opened right onto the iconic crossing, where we had a laugh at how underwhelming it was. We had a reservation at Shibuya Sky later in the day at 3:30, so we killed time going to Parco Mall for the many different shops. We had a great time walking around Shibuya and think it was an excellent shopping/food experience. Looking back, I’d spend more time in Shibuya than Shinjuku or Ginza.

I was on the fence about staying for the sunset at Shibuya Sky because the weather was cloudy. We decided to wait for the sunset, but I’m not 100% sure it was worth it. The weather was cold and overcast, and we spent most of the time indoors. I also found the Tokyo skyline to be too homogeneous, and paired with the grey sky, it didn't feel as memorable as other observatories I've visited in New York City. The sunset was pretty, but nothing to write home about. The real magic, in my opinion, came around the ""Blue Hour""—the few minutes after the sun goes past the horizon when the lights start to turn on. The city really came alive, and my initial criticism of the skyline completely faded. The Tokyo Tower looked absolutely stunning against the night sky from Shibuya Sky. Depending on the weather forecast, I’d recommend coming slightly after sunset to catch that blue hour/nighttime view of the city.

Afterward, we did a bit more shopping and headed back to the hotel to drop everything off before checking out Shinjuku and Golden Gai.

Once we got to Golden Gai, we were extremely underwhelmed and ended up laughing at how touristy it all felt, with multiple tour guides shuffling people around ,but it was silent. Despite being busy, no one was talking. We only cared about two bars: Anime Bar and Open Book. We ended up getting a spot at the Open Book bar, which was pretty, but the drinks were overpriced. It also had a kind of ‘cold’ vibe—the bottom floor was for tourists, while the top floor was for locals, as the bartender would send anyone who spoke Japanese upstairs. When we got in, for a packed bar, it was surprisingly silent. Eventually, we struck up a conversation with a couple next to us. There was a small cover charge, and the lemon sour was just okay. However, the Cola Sour was absolutely delicious! We finished quickly, tried at the Anime Bar, but it was still packed and made our way to Kabukicho/Godzilla instead.

Kabukicho was interesting and definitely lived up to its infamous reputation. I felt fine and ignored the street promoters trying to get us to shake hands or strike up conversations. My girlfriend didn’t feel the same though. We had originally considered booking our hotel here, and she said she was glad we didn’t since she felt like she would have been unable to step outside alone due to possibly being harassed and followed. She said she didn’t feel that way in any other location we stayed at. I was also shocked to see so many tourists going up to the street promoters and following them into the clubs. One group even asked, ""Where can we have fun?"" I was shocked that they didn’t realize most of these guys are scammers.

We got our pictures with Godzilla and walked into the movie theater, which completely blew us away. Why are Japanese movie theaters so cool! They had a little gift shop where we found exclusive made in Japan Wicked merch. The food also looked good and cheap! We seriously considered watching a movie, but didn’t have the time.

Slightly disappointed with Shinjuku, we walked past a gacha claw game place in Kabukicho, where I found out I had a little gambling addiction. Later, I learned that the UFO claw game at this location was reasonably priced at 100 yen per try, compared to 200 yen in Akihabara.

**Day 9, Wednesday: Tsukiji Outer Market, Diver City (Teamlabs Planet)(Freak snow day) –**

This day started off weirdly—with a freak hailstorm that turned into snow. The weather report said it was only going to rain, but in Shinjuku, we got a solid inch of snow. **Pro Tip:** All our hotels offered free umbrellas to borrow, so no need to buy one.

I wouldn't visit Tsukiji Market on a Wednesday again as many places are closed. Despite the snow, walking through the stalls was still fun. We ended up at a coffee shop that was random but hilarious—turns out, it was John Lennon's favorite place? They had a newspaper claiming it was. We also found a ramen spot that was a Godsend For the extremely cold weather, and I highly recommend it.

Given the windy, snowy, and rainy weather, we decided to head to Diver City a little earlier than planned. It worked out great as a collection of indoor malls. We spent some time in all the shops, and the Gundam shop was really fun. We even picked up some exclusive items from there.

We had dinner at Gonpachi Odaiba after trying some takoyaki at the Takakoyaki food court. Then we headed to TeamLab Planets.

I chose TeamLab Planet over Borderless because I wanted the linear experience. I’ve known about TeamLab since 2016 when I first saw it through Jakenbakelive on Twitch, and I was really excited to experience it for myself. I'm happy to say it surpassed my expectations. The water section was soooooooo fun — we spent most of our time there and had to drag ourselves away to explore the other parts. Highly recommend it – 10/10. The room where you sit and watch the dome projection of flowers/plants moving around is extremely trippy. My girlfriend is prone to motion sickness and mentioned this was the only room that made her quite dizzy once she sat up.

We left around closing time, probably spending more than three hours there. Now, on my Excel schedule, I had planned to take the metro, but Google Maps said a bus would be ""faster."" Normally, I avoid buses because they're an unreliable gamble. However, we decided to risk it, which turned out to be a mistake. When we got to the bus stop, there was a line of people waiting—and worst of all, the bus didn't stop at the stop because it was already packed.

**Pro Tip:** If you have the option of taking the metro vs. a bus, choose the metro, even if it's 5 minutes slower. It's not worth the risk. We had to backtrack for 10 minutes and ride the metro.

**Day 10, Thursday: Ginza, Akihabara**

This day was laser-focused on two main goals: find a Rukia from Bleach Relax Time series figure in Akihabara and get a pair of made-in-Japan loafers from the Haruta brand in Ginza. We also had our omakase reservation, which I made through Tablelog (the Japanese version, since the English version didn't allow for reservations).

Our day started early in Jinbocho, where I had found a cute coffee shop online prior. However, when we got there, we learned it was closed due to the public holiday—along with our backup option. So, we ended up at Trully's Coffee. Afterward, we walked around the Imperial Gardens while waiting for our omakese reservation at noon. The gardens were gorgeous, and I’d love to return when everything is blooming. It's huge, so don't underestimate the time it takes to cross the garden.

All the walking and the light breakfast set us up perfectly for our lunch at Ginza Sushi Banya. I managed to snag a lunch reservation for a crazy good price of about $60 per person. This spot is clearly popular with locals, as the reservation required a Japanese Tabelog account, making us the only tourists. They were extremely welcoming, though. The sushi experience completely spoiled us—I’d love to do this again.

After lunch, we did some more shopping. Eventually setting off to find the Haruta loafers, made our way to a random ABC-mart in a mall. Little did we know, the mall had a physical Haruta section! It was a complete surprise and a great find. The workers helped us try on what we wanted, and we walked out with a pair each. They were a great price for well-made loafers. We spent some more time walking around Ginza before heading toward Akihabara.

At Akihabara, I wasn’t expecting to enjoy it much, as everyone online talks about it in a mixed way. However, I ended up having an absolute blast—so much so that we decided to stay longer than originally planned. We grabbed some food at Cow Cow Kitchen, which I highly recommend cheap and yummy.

We set out to find my Bleach figure, hitting up multiple figure stores. It was a lot of fun, but prices were all over the place, so don’t commit to anything on first sight—shop around! One store may have an item for three times the price of the store next door, where it could be under 1000 yen. We were having no luck with Bleach figures until our last store, where we struck gold. We found so many Bleach figures, and by sheer luck, I got my Relax Time Rukia! We almost screamed when my girlfriend pulled it out. **Pro Tip:** Do some figure research beforehand and it becomes like a mini treasure hunt.

We didn’t do any UFO crane games, as the 200 yen per play it didn’t seem worth it compared to what we found in Shinjuku, but we still walked around finding cool gachapons we wanted.

I really wish I'd spent more time in Akihabara. Even if you're not there for shopping, just browsing is a lot of fun.

***Shinjuku Hotel Review: Onsen Ryokan Yuen 4/10***  
The hotel was pretty, but it was ruined by several things. Poor cleaning (the room was extremely dusty). Lack of AC control (Kyoto and Asakusa both allowed us to control it), and the room was incredibly stuffy—so much so that we ended up sleeping naked because it was so hot. The AC was centrally controlled, but it was basically off. Also, one set of elevators was constantly being used, which meant crazy waits just to get to the lobby. The onsen experience was disappointing for my girlfriend, which soured the overall experience. We won't stay here again.

**Day 11, Friday: Shinjuku –**

The last day arrived, and the trip felt both long and short at the same time. For my final morning onsen, I got to see a gorgeous sunrise, which was the perfect way to end it. We had pre-booked an airport ‘limousine,’ essentially a bus, to take us to the airport, so we didn’t need to worry about our two checked bags. Our flight wasn't until 9 PM, so we still had time to explore. We taxied to Keio Plaza Hotel, where the limousine was scheduled to pick us up. The hotel has a deal with the airport limousine service, so they will hold up to two bags per person, which worked out perfectly for us.

After dropping off our bags, we headed to Musashino Mori Diner for breakfast to finally try fluffy pancakes. We loved it! We got their pancake sets, which included a rice dish and pancakes for 'dessert.' The pancakes reminded me of eating whipped cream — they were so light and fluffy.

The rest of the day was spent exploring Shinjuku, doing a final Donki run, checking out Beams, and just soaking in the sights before heading back to Keio Plaza to catch our limousine to the airport.

I was a skeptic about how much a difference a fancy and expensive hand grinder will do to enhance your cup of coffee. I got into pour over little over a year ago after a trip to Quebec. Came home and ordered some gear. Already owned a cheap electric coffee grinder, and I convinced myself this grinder was doing a fine job. After some parts started to wear out, I started looking into a hand grinder. Which is a daunting task as there are so many variables and brands to choose from. I read a lot of posts about which brand to look at and which models may be best for my situation. I purchased a Timemore S3 based on reviews, and a good friend’s recommendation. 

I brewed my first two cups today with the timemore. First cup was with some low tier beans from the supermarket. I’m not a fan of the beans as they stand, so didn’t have high expectations. Cup came out over extracted, but may had more to do with the beans being a darker medium roast. Like a kid with a new toy, I had to tinker with the grinder again. So I brewed a second cup, but with my bag of Gracenote Ethiopian beans. Adjusted the timemore to a coarser grind. Noticed how uniform the grounds looked in the basket. 

I can’t believe how much of a difference the grinder made. I taste so much more of the beans, and the tasting notes are spot on. I’m officially spoiled now. Plus, I love the feel of grinding the beans. My coffee brewing has become very meditative for me. So for anyone on the fence about upgrading to a Timemore or 1zpresso, do so. You’ll notice the improvements in the first or second cup. ",3,1743101207.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

I came across this question a few times, and everyone was like, whenever they showed their vulnerability, it didn’t turn out to be good. I think I understand now what they mean by that in the past few days. 

I would say my family is pretty good. We are all chill and comfortable with each other, and we are vocal about our thoughts. Just like me—I’m probably the most vocal about them. Our business has been having some trouble for the past 2–3 years. It happens; all businesses have ups and downs. We know because Dad opened up about it. We are in this together. He may not share every minute detail, but he shares everything with Maa—that’s how it is.  

A few days ago, some people from the society (here, samaj) visited our house to ask for a donation. Before they arrived, I asked Dad how much he was planning to give. He said, ""5100?"" I felt even that was too much because he had just made another donation before this. When the people came, they started with 25k. I was listening to their conversation from the kitchen, and I was baffled. Finally, the amount they wrote on the cheque was 15k.  

I was sad and angry. Maa said, ""You don’t understand, but if not us, who else will pay back to society? Don’t worry; it will come back to us."" I didn’t say anything to Dad, though I wanted to. Still, he kept asking what happened, and I broke down with tears in my eyes ,and just asked, ""Itne jyada paise hai kya apne paas?""(Do we have lots of money?)  and he just laughed and hugged saying ""aree ho jata sab barobar,dw"" (it will be fine, dw)

I said this because, in the past few years, I wouldn’t say we compromised on a lot, but we tried to save as much as possible, even the tiniest amounts. Our thought process was like: I feel like having coffee, let's go out. Wait—150 for a single coffee? Let it be. Let’s make it at home; in 150, we all can have good coffee. My point is, knowing that the business hasn’t been doing well lately, I would hesitate to ask Dad for even 100–200 rupees, even though the situation wasn’t that bad.  

That day, when Dad came back in the evening for a break, he saw the groceries I bought, and he immediately said, ""OMG, these many things? You just stocked up last month, right?"" That’s what irritated me. That grocery run didn’t have a single extra thing—just spices—and the last time we stocked up was six months ago. Again, I didn’t say anything, though I wanted to lash out about it.  

When he left, I asked Maa, ""What was the point of doing this? Was it even worth it? What do we get by donating or giving out money even when we don’t have enough?"" She said something that I may not agree with, but now I understand it. She said:  

""Sometimes, we just have to do it—to show society that we are stable.""

She told me that when Dad was a mere worker, nobody asked about him. When he first started a business, very few supported him. But when he started giving a little bit to society, the most important thing was that it helped bring in a lot of business. It gave Dad immense respect and standing in the community.  

""These things may seem superficial to your generation, but they matter to us.""

She was right. For us, the concept of ""log kya kahenge"" is annoying and unnecessary. But for them—at least for my dad—it’s his happy place. He is loved among them. He is respected in society. His presence is requested at special events. And I agree with this part—even if he calls someone in the middle of the night for an emergency, ten people will be here in just one call. For him, this is more important than money, maybe.

The reason I blabbered all of this—which may not even make sense to some people—is that, that day, I wanted to say: ""If we have that much money, then don’t say at home that business is bad, that there are no earnings."" But I didn’t. I realized that he was sharing his troubles, and I was asking him to quit sharing them. That’s when I understood why men have to think so much before showing their vulnerabilities—because society thinks they are capable of handling it all. That they are born for this.  

Just like my dad—he has to think of society, his business, his home, and a little bit about himself when sharing his worries.  

I may still not understand his way of thinking, but I will just accept it. I will just let him be the real him at home.

**Part 1:**

This is for the newbies, or the sponges that have been wandering around aimlessly. Most people will say to read the bible. I feel that I must be more helpful to the newbie.  
  
Edit - This was posted in the Discussion forum, but noone cares.  
  
Just some ground rules...  
\- Anything in red...is something I'm telling you to do if you were doing whatever I was talking about!  
\- Remember anything in green  
\- ""I am speaking your thoughts out to the world. You don't know it yet, but you will be thinking about it.""  
  
Alrighty, here we go!   
  
\------------  
  
So you just found this amazing forum that talks about dating girls and improving life! You can't wait to muster all of your strength to become a sponge and to tell the world and wait an answer on your current troubles....  
  
Admitting you have a problem is the first step in recovery.  
""I'm new and this is my first post. I..""  
1 - Like this girl I know..  
2 - I have low self-esteem...  
3 - I'm a loser...  
4 - I'm shy...  
5 - I want to improve..  
6 - I've just got my heart broken.  
  
I now command you to **stop writing about it!!!!** Will some online anonymous person be able to give you the magical rock that will make your problem go away? **Nope.**  
  
Now, go get a coffee, or some tea, relax and open your mind before we go farther.

THis is your [first stop](http://www.sosuave.net/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid=56520). Re-read it a few times.  
  
The definition of a Don Juan.  


>Pook: A Don Juan is a state of mind, not a list of methods and tricks.

To expand, this isn't some style of martial arts with pre-determined moves and a sensa to develop it. This is self-help, self-improvement and self-guided.  
  
\- You are the only one that can change your life. You think it sucks, change it by reading on.  
\- You must be happy with yourself before others will be happy with you.  
\- You must know that you do not **need** a girl to love you.  
\- You must know that you do not **need** to love a girl.  
\- You must find a way to be positive in everything.  
\- You must live each day as if it was your last chance.  
  
The concept of a Don Juan is when you are successful in your eyes. Not only with girls, but with all aspects of your life. Even though this thread and this forum in general is directed at girls, you will soon learn that it applies to daily life as well!  
  
\-------------  
  
""So now that I have those words in green in the back of my mind, what am I doing wrong?"" Alas! You sound so negative now. I want you to think far back, way way back, to the day you had seen her for the first time.  
  
The Relationship Begins Before You Meet Her - Thread Title by Survivor  
  
""So what does that have to do with anything??""  
  
From the minute you first saw her, you knew what you were thinking about her. About how beautiful she is, perfect, caring, passionate. How much you wanted to fall in love with her and to one day awaken next to her years later and feel the same.  
  
""You're right! She is so..."" Say no more. You do not fully understand yet. Take all of your current thoughts and tuck them away and read.  
  
From the moment **SHE** first sees you, before you even talk to her, she's thought about how sexy you are, your social status, your personality and your mood. Within seconds, this girl has already placed you somewhere on a list. Before you open your mouth, she's already developed the response. Before you even knew she was there, she's already figured out if you're worth her time. (I searched endlessly but I could not find the elusive one who posted something like this)  
  
""Gasp! I never knew women had it all figured out!?""  
You have a lot to learn. Women want a MAN, someone THEY can not be ashamed to fall for. If you appear to be normal, or weak, you've already made it hard on yourself.  
  
\-----------------  
  


>Pook:  
""Ladies! Do tell me, what do you define as a Man?""  
  
""A Man is someone sensitive to me.""  
""A Man is the guy who will take care of my needs.""  
""A Man is the one that is in tune with my feelings.""  
""A Man is one who doesn't have an ego.""  
""A Man is the guy who will sit and watch chick flicks all day with me.""  
""A Man is the guy who will go shopping with me.""  
""A Man is the guy who will share all his feelings with me.""  
  
Such are the common answers! The males listen and actualize what the women say. They are constantly declared 'sweet' and 'wonderful' and 'nice', oh 'so nice'.[Click to expand...]()

I want to ask you something.  
""Yes?""  
Do you do any of what a women says is a man?  
""\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, but you/Pook said that women want a MAN, and I'm doing a bunch of those qualities. What's wrong now..""  
I urge you to read more!  
  


>Pook:  
Poor Nice Guy! The women his own age avoid him like the plague and jump for the jerks. The Nice Guy becomes an emotional tampon to be used and discarded. The Nice Guy, being so nice and sweet, listens to the woman vomit her feelings about men and bleed her problems of her boyfriend on him. He listens with baited hope when he hears, ""Oh, why can't guys be like you! You listen and understand."" Then she turns around and gets abused by another jerk! The vicious cycle repeats again and again.

Do you feel the same way?  
  
\---------------  
  
""I feel angered! Women say that they want a MAN, and I act as a MAN, yet those jerks keep taking my women away!!""  
  
What women **thinks**, **wants**, **says** and **does** are totally different things.  
  
""Alright...""  
Hear me out. I know you are confused. I was once a nice guy too! I was called sweet, nice and someone to depend on. All I got in return was the stories of how OTHERS are and were boyfriends. It goes something like this.  
  
\- A women thinks of herself. ""How will this affect me"", ""Is this good or bad"", ""What should I do""  
\- A women's wants are not logicial and are near-impossible to understand.  
\- A women says what is in her best interests.  
\- A women does what feels best.  
  
To mash it into one! She tells you are a nice guy **(S)**, goes out with that jerk **(D)** thinking it's totally alright **(T)** while trying to change him into what she wants. **(W)** When he dumps her, she crys to you **(D)**, saying how sweet you are **(S)**, how she wished he could be like you **(W)** and yet thinking of the next jerk she wants to cycle though. **(T)**  
  
Complicated, yes. Do we understand why she does this...not really. So Don Juans over time have developed a way to win over jerks (think of it as a scent). This scent, it attracts women intially and when she finds out what that scent is and begins to explore it, she finds that all of those 4 things about women mash together and cause her to think the same things, only about you. I lead you to the next points of how to start becoming the perfect scent/man!  
  
The real definition of a man, tried, tested and true. (Pook)  
\- Does not go through life walking on eggshells. **Go for what you want**  
\- Focuses on his dreams. **A passion (art, music..), a life-long dream to own the world, etc**  
\- Does not apologize for his testosterone, for his desires. **Don't deny that you want to feel fullied**  
\- Tries to always win in what he does. **Never give up**  
\- Has deep convictions that allows him to be a possible leader. **Take control of your life**  
\- Seeks to solve problems then to place blame. **Act instead of complaining**  
\- Sees failure as only a temporary set-back to the inevitable. **Life goes on, your day will come**  
\- Knows where he is going in Life. **The life-plan and control of it**  
\- Never loses his passion, for that would be the death of his soul. **Heart, dedication to YOUR life.**  
\- Never feels he has to prove himself to anyone. **If anyone shall hate you, toss you away, make you inferior, then they are of no worth to you**  
  
""So I must be a MAN, that is a jerk, so I can have her?!""  
No, that is a lesson for the future, where you will learn of niceness, jerkness and everything in between! Now, I want you to go to bed. I want you to lie there and just think. Let the past and the present clash. Let the thoughts about your life flow from your eyes and shape your brain for the future. Allow yourself to open yourself to the things that have been missing all along. Take control of your life and make your plan that will make your dreams come true.  
  
For without the first step forward, the journey cannot begin.  
Without the journey, there is no purpose to life.  
Without a purpose to life, you cease to live. - Unknown

  
**Part 2:**

""I'm awake, and I've thought of everything you've said and I think I have a plan to get her and to be successful! Thank you so much!""  
Wait! To leave now gives you no better of a chance. You did not think properly enough. It is not about THIS girl, this is about you. What are your dreams?  
""\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_""  
Alright, did you plan on a way to make them come true?  
""Well....kinda....""  
Alas! A typical answer to just a simple question.  
""What do you mean?""  
You've thought about your life, your future, that I can see. To plan it out though, you have not found yet.  
  
I shall now give you some stones.  
**Determination and Passion**  
**Inner Strength and Confidence**  
**Desire and Life**  
  
""Those aren't stones, they are just words.""  
  
For life to become what you want, you must place the stones that you shall walk on. You must remember that nothing will push you off, for on both sides lie the waters of despair!  
  
Yes, it would seem that they are just words. But words transform into power and knowledge. Language gives us the power to express everything within us and allow ourselves to partake in our actions. Even when we could not speak, when we had no words, there were actions. By waving your hand, in daily life, that means hello. It also shows openness, having a nice nature and un-afraid to make movement.  
""What about giving someone the finger?""  
You tell me, we both know what it MEANS, but what does it show?  
""Ahh....I see...literally.""  
  
Here is another stone.  
For my thoughts to mean anything, I must act as such. **To think something gets you nowhere. To say something shows desire. To do something about it shows confidence.**  
  
""What does that mean?""  
You are the perfect example!  
""Who..? Me? What are you talking about?""  
You have thought about your dreams and what you want. You have spoken those desires to me. But you have yet to make it happen for yourself.  
""But it's so much work!""  
Would I be telling you all of this if it wasn't worth it to obtain your dreams?  
""I guess, you are writing a lot. But I really want \_\_\_\_""  
Then on we go.   
  
\------------------  
  
Work now, play later. Play now, Pay Later  
  
You have two choices. You can play games, talk on the phone and shoot the sh\*t and finally corner yourself into doing something, or you can develop your life and play as you go.  
""What do you mean entirely?""  
Instead of sitting there doing nothing, even right now you are learning of how to shape your life. You have the right attitude, ask questions and they shall be answered somehow!  
""Alright, so about this girl still...""  
Shhhh! I like to hear questions, but I must tell you this too. Understand something about the theory before you ask about it  
""There's a theory to asking questions?""  
Not exactly. For you to ask a question, you must know something of it. You begin to talk about how you are in love with her, and your one and only question at the end is, ""What's wrong?"".  
""Exactly!""  
Yes, but you know nothing of what you could be doing wrong. You say all of these actions and thoughts, but you know not yet of the consequence of it all.  
""So I'm doing something wrong then?""  
In a way. Has her reaction been what you expected?  
""No...not really""  
It is time for some useful tidbits.  
  
\- When a girls says that she wants personality in a guy, she means something more then your lifeless a$$. She wants someone to lead her on the edge, experience the new. Sitting there wondering about her isn't going to get her.  
\- To be just friends with a girl is being the boyfriend without the girlfriend.  
\- You will fail, repeatly. Not one single person you meet has had a flawless record with life, so don't expect candies and apples.  
\- Learn and adpat.  
\- Open your mind to new ways of thinking, new ways of doing something.  
\- There are infinite amounts of ways to meet girls.  
\- Being different sounds so unordinary. Stupidly enough, different raises eyebrows.  
\- Believe in yourself, noone else will if you've given up.  
\- There's a thin line between common sense and utter stupidity.  
\- Do what you feel is best. ie) Don't give in with nothing.  
\- Absorb, understand and apply.  
  
""There's millions of quotes like that!""  
I know . I pointed those out because they apply. Not just for girls, but your quality of life in general. They are scattered all over this forum.  
""So everyone has a tip to say.""  
Yep, and some are good, some are bad, some don't apply, some do.  
""Take it with a grain of salt!""  
Indeed. I will now continue on.  
""To what?""  
You! I will make you not only better at getting girls, but also at obtaining your eventual goals!

I had been in a relationship for two years during my 12th standard back in 2018. She was my first love. We went to the same coaching center together. She was the most understanding, caring, and fun person. I messed things up at that time and ended up breaking up with her. It took me a long time to realize what I had lost. I thought I had moved on—no contact, just one picture we took together and her passport-size photo tucked away in my old wallet. 

I believed I had moved on… until today. I was passing by that coaching center after seven years and noticed a coffee house nearby. The street had this unique aroma, one that I strongly associate with her because we spent so much time there. As soon as I smelled it, my heart started beating fast, my eyes filled with tears, and I was left numb. It felt like a wave of everything I missed in that moment.

I then switched over to the 1zpresso Jx after a year and absolutely love the process of hand grinding and the improved results you get for a fraction of the price of an equivalent electric grinder.

I am now looking to get an endgame hand grinder, i.e. one that *hopefully* I won't be wanting to upgrade anymore (famous last words). I am not interested in any electric grinders.

1. I almost solely drink fruity washed light roast beans, with the occasional processed coffees to switch things up. Always light to ultra-light.
2. I plan to get a Cafelat Robot in a couple years to start brewing espresso.

I've narrowed down my choices to the ZP6 or Pietro (though unsure between the B or M model with pro burrs). I really would like to increase the clarity of my brews as I find that is what is most lacking with the Jx at this point. I would also like to eventually hand grind for espresso with the Robot. From my understanding, ZP6 just can't do espresso, while Pietro can (only B model?). But if my Jx would suffice for espresso grinding, then that would be okay.

Is the Pietro worth it for more than double the price, plus the awful ergonomics? The main benefits I see are even more clarity than the ZP6 plus possibly better espresso grinding than the Jx. But if ZP6 is close enough to endgame filter grinding and the Jx will work pretty well for espresso grinding with the robot, I would prefer to go that route.",1,1743100975.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

1jlb2or,https://i.redd.it/yy9rcpim0are1.jpeg,"My very unpopular opinion on ""The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo"", directed by David Fincher","(SPOILER ALERT)

I had been wanting to watch The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for a very long time ; first because I love Fincher (Se7en is one of my favorite movies), second because I already read (or rather devoured) the Millennium trilogy by the late Stieg Larsson (TGWTDT is, let’s not forget, an adaptation of the novel of the same name). 

Well… 

I’m disappointed.

Imagine over 1,000 pages of investigation, introspection, analysis, and scheming. Now imagine a film adaptation of those 1,000 pages that barely lasts two hours. See where I’m going with this? 

This movie feels like a summary. Steven Zaillian (the screenwriter) bulldozed through the original plot. Everything is shortened, to the point where it gets a bit confusing (if I hadn’t read the book, I think I would have struggled to understand what was going on).

For example, take the scene where Henrik Vanger meets Mikael for the first time and explains all the ins and outs of the Harriet Vanger mystery. In the book, this scene spans dozens of pages. In the movie, it lasts no more than five minutes.

I was also a bit disappointed by Lisbeth, even though Rooney Mara’s performance is remarkable. In the novel, she is arguably the most complex and unique female character I’ve ever encountered. In the film, she’s nothing but a reserved goth who knows how to hack computers. This is probably because the book places a huge emphasis on her thoughts, which is hard to replicate in a two-hour movie.

I’d also like to point out two performances that I found off the mark. First, Stellan Skarsgård (who plays Martin Vanger). You can tell he’s a psychopath from his very first appearance in the film (and no, this has nothing to do with me having read the book). His coldness, his gaze… you raise an eyebrow at him right away. In the book, Martin is infinitely more warm and charming. At no point do you suspect him of even killing a fly—until Mikael unmasks him, and then he reveals his true nature.

Second, Daniel Craig (who plays Mikael Blomkvist). I found him too cold, too robotic (too James Bond). The Mikael in the book is far more human—passionate about his work (or should I say obsessed), about women, about simple things like a cup of coffee… None of that is well represented in the film.

And Millennium?! One of the best aspects of the book is the slow rise of this small newspaper, held together by a handful of passionate people. In the film, this aspect is completely botched. Barely a few minutes are dedicated to it, and I would have preferred if they hadn’t bothered at all. The staff is large (which is odd, considering the paper is supposed to be on the verge of collapse), dull, cold (they celebrate their revenge on Wennerström with crossed arms and austere expressions)… In one word : depressing.

All that said, the film does have its strengths, particularly Cronenweth’s cinematography and Reznor’s score, which effectively highlight Hedestad’s cold and eerie atmosphere.

Is it a bad movie? No. Is it a masterpiece? Definitely not, especially after reading the excellent novel by the late Stieg Larsson.

I'm looking for a song I was listening some years back. I remember that the song was made by a band ft an artist. Main vocals were one male and one female *(I think she was the feat, but I'm not sure about it)*. The male was singing about being depress/sad/having a hard time, while the female in chorus was cheering on him, saying she is going to help him/be there for him or something along these lines. I know this song was rather know, but nothing absurdly popular as in topping in charts. I'll list some things I'm sure about, and some others I think are correct, but I wouldn't necessarily bet on it.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

**100% Sure:**

\- Male and a Female vocals, both singers were white *(weird details to remember, I know, but I'm grasping the straws here)*, the guy had dark hair

\- Released between 2008-2018

\- Guy singing about a hard time, female being the uplifting/helpful one

\- It was not ""Just give me a Reason"" by Fun and Pink. We can exclude this one.

  
**I think it's true, but might be wrong:**

\- Actually released between 2012-2016

\- Male mentioned having a **coffee** and a **shower** in the morning, I think in the first verse *(that's about all the lyrics I can't think off, I'm sorry)*

*-* Made by a band feat additional artist

\- Was rather popular *(I think it had middle-higher double-digits million views on YT back when I was listening to it)*

\- Rather simple music video, I think the band and the singer were just in a room singing to each other with some camera-work, without any acting

\- I suck at music genres, but I'd say it was somewhat rock-ish/pop-ish? I think it could be similar to **The Script** or **Simple Plan** or something along these lines

The construction feels solid, with just the right amount of give and a flawless draw. The cold draw offers notes of sweet hay, cedar, and a hint of cream, setting the stage for a smooth and mellow smoking experience.

First Third – Smooth & Creamy

Lighting up is effortless, and the Macanudo Café immediately delivers a mild, creamy smoke. The first few puffs bring out toasted nuts, cedar, and a touch of vanilla like sweetness. The retrohale is silky smooth, with just a hint of white pepper. The burn is razor sharp and the ash holds strong, showcasing the brand’s renowned consistency.

Second Third – Balanced & Buttery

As the cigar progresses, the flavors remain subtle yet well balanced. The creaminess becomes more pronounced, with notes of buttered toast and almonds - a real treat for me, as I love buttery flavors in cigars. A touch of honey like sweetness lingers on the finish, adding just enough complexity without overpowering the palate. Strength stays in the mild range, making it a fantastic choice for a morning or early afternoon smoke.

Final Third – A Smooth Farewell

The final stretch of the Macanudo Café is just as smooth and easygoing as the first. A soft woody note emerges, blending well with the creamy texture that remains until the very last puff. There are no harsh transitions or unexpected spice kicks; just a clean, mild finish that leaves a pleasant aftertaste.

Final Thoughts

It’s the perfect beginner-friendly smoke, an excellent daily choice for mild cigar lovers, and an all-around reliable option for any occasion. Whether enjoyed with a morning coffee or as a light afternoon indulgence, it never disappoints. Such a shame it was my last one...

On this beautiful sunny afternoon, I decided to light up my last Macanudo Café—a cigar I brought home from a trip to the Dominican Republic seven years ago. Well-aged and perfectly preserved, it felt like the right choice for a relaxing pre-lunch smoke.

1jlav3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1jlav3q/trip_report/,Trip Report,"First, I would like to thank everyone here who helped me fine tune my trip and make some decisions. I'm a seasoned traveler and this was not my first time to CR, but it was still a little daunting!

We (two adults, two kids - ages 10 and 12) just returned from a 2-week trip to CR. Overall the trip was phenomenal. Normally I would debrief on the ""good, the bad and the ugly"", but there was no ugly and not even really any bad, just a few ""mehs"". Buckle up, my review is long and detailed!

We flew into Liberia. Process was fast and easy. Outside security we met with the Avis agent and boarded a shuttle to the Avis office, which was about 10 mins or so from the airport. Service was great. There were no hidden costs or pressure to buy extras. We understood the insurance rules and opted to purchase full insurance from them for $45/day to give us peace of mind. We got a nissan qashqai, which was a smaller vehicle than I expected, but it fit us and our stuff, so we rolled with it. In hindsight, we were thrilled to have a smaller car on the narrow, twisty roads! 

After grabbing lunch, we hit the road to La Fortuna. This was my least favourite part of the trip! The drive around the lake is daunting and I was white knuckled the whole way. The roads are narrow, steep, twisty and have no shoulder or guard rails in most places. My husband didn't mind as much but i was honestly pretty nervous. With that said, the drive is also gorgeous, with beautiful views.  You just have to be prepared, take your time and stay alert. 

We stayed in La Fortuna for 6 nights at Silencio del Campo. That may seem like a lot, but honestly, I think i could have spent the whole two weeks there and not been bored. I cannot say enough good things about the hotel. It was our second time staying here and we loved it just as much this time. Its mid-range (which is our preference), spacious, clean. Close enough to be convenient, far enough to be quiet. If I had to eke out a negative about this place, it would be that the beds are pretty hard and the hair dryers are weak, so pretty minor! I won't go into details here, but happy to answer any questions anyone has about the hotel. 

Originally, we had a million activities planned here, but once we got in we decided to simplify, do one activity per day and spend more chill time at the pools and hot springs. I'm thrilled we did this, gave the vacation more balance and resulted in slightly less complaints from the kids! Activities we did do:

1. Ziplining with ecoglide. My son and husband did this and had an absolute blast. It was my son's first time, so he was a bit nervous but the staff were great and put him at ease. This ended up being his favourite activity the whole trip.

2. Canyoning with Pure Trek. All four of us did this. You take a shuttle (or drive) to pure treks headquarters and then we take this truck thing (open back with two rows of seats) to the canyon. Ride is bumpy and seats are slippy. Once there, you gear up and the take a short hike to the first rappel, which is also the biggest - 150 feet down a waterfall! Kids were nervous, but staff were great. Son and husband went, me and daughter were up (I'm afraid of heights so my legs were jelly by this point!), daughter panicked and refused to go. Staff were amazing with her but she's a kid who knows her own mind and once she decided that was it. Staff offered to escort us to the fourth rappel, which was the smallest, we would meet up with our group there and she could try again. This hike was literally the hardest that we did haha but we were accompanied by a local dog! At that point my daughter worked up her nerve and did the last two, then she got upset that she didn't do them all! Overall great experience, only regret is that my daughter missed out on the first three, but such is life. 

3. Safari float with Canoa tours. Nice chill day on the river, saw a ton of animals. Great guide, great service. Kids got a bit bored between animal sightings, but I loved it. 

4. Mistico hanging bridges. We had great intentions to get up early and be there for 7 when it opened, but we were on vacation, so we snoozed a bit and got there at 830! By that point it was rather busy, but honestly not that bad. The only bottle necks were at the large bridges, and that was because staff were there to space people out. Otherwise we barely saw people on the trails unless a group were stopped looking at an animal. Kids complained about all the walking, as they do, but I loved it! After the hike we had lunch (fine, expensive, actual food looks nothing like the pictures) and rolled ice cream (delicious). 

5. Night hike with Arenal Night Hikes. So i messed up a bit on this one. I had taken notes on the different options for night hikes (there are so many!) and found the one I wanted. Long story short, I wanted to book directly with the tour group and not through viator, so I googled them but was brought to the wrong page and booked the wrong tour! The group we went with were new, only 4 months in operation i believe and it was fine. Kids were actually pretty nervous, which surprised me as this seemed right up their alley. Guide was very knowledgeable, but not overly personable. We saw lot of frogs, and bugs. Hike was good, but it was crazy humid. Overall I like the concept but would likely do it with a more experienced group the next time.

5. Sky adventures gondola. We did this when we were trying to kill an hour one day. Most people take the gondola up to start the ziplining course, but you can take it up without ziplining just for the views, etc. Gondola ride is only about 10 minutes, views from top are gorgeous, but nothing that you can't see from other places for much less money! There's this cool hand sculpture at the top that you can get pics at which was fun, but that's it. We thought there were trails, but it's really just the paths between ziplines. Overall. nothing wrong with the activity, great for little kids, but wouldn't advise it otherwise as it's quite pricey.

6. Don Juan Chocolate and Coffee tour. The other people in our time slot ended up cancelling so we got a private tour which was cool. The property is gorgeous, guide was super informative and fun. They also put a lot of effort into making the tour as interactive as possible, which the kids loved. Great tour, highly recommend. 

Outside of that, we just chilled. Spend alot of time in the pool, hot springs at our hotel. Did some wandering in town. Had our best sloth sighting on the side of the road, it was about 10 feet off the ground and putting on a show for everyone. Great experience. 

Food wise, we're not foodies and didn't come to CR looking for great food. Ate in town a few times, couldn't really tell you restaurant names. Ate a bunch at the hotel for convenience, just as good as anywhere else we ate and priced a bit better. Got some stuff at grocery store a few times and ate on our deck. No bad experiences, but nothing stands out as amazing either!

On day 7, we sadly left la Fortuna and made our way to Poasita. Stopped in Alajuela to spend a few hours at Zoo Ave to break up the drive. If you haven't been, this is a great rescue centre. Beautiful grounds with impressive habitats for the animals. We also had a very tasty lunch here.  Drive up the hills to Poasita was fine, twisty, hilly and narrow as expected. Only tricky part was a stretch of a few KM where it was a single lane with no shoulder, very happy we didn't meet anyone here!

In poasita, we stayed at the Poas Observatory Lodge for two nights. This is a ""glamping"" set up with three or four domes. They were fine, def not glamorous though! Very simple, smaller than they looked in pictures. No hot water, no actual flooring, just concrete with a few thread bare mats thrown down. When we arrived, a guy said ""are you ""husbands first name""? We responded, he told us the key was in the door and walked away. That was the only interaction we had except when my husband had to go up later that evening to ask for a heater because we were freezing. I knew it was colder up here and was prepared (or thought I was), but it went down to 8 degrees at night and these domes have zero insulation and are super drafty. Even with the heater (which they charge for, instead of just including it knowing that its cold!) didn't do much. We literally only slept there, so it was fine, but i def wouldn't recommend for anyone spending any time in the area.  

So after a freezing night, we got up early and headed to Poas volcano. It was a gorgeous clear day and we had perfect views. This is a relatively quick tour - you park, get a helmet, listen to a 5-minute safety video and then walk about 15 minutes to the crater. Once you're there, you have 20 minutes to observe, take pictures, etc, then you walk back. I was really excited about this because on our last trip we tried to see it three times but it was too overcast each time. And it didn't disappoint, it was very cool. They also have a great little cafe where we stopped for pastries afterwards. Then we headed to La Paz waterfalls gardens for the rest of the day. Last time we were down, we were lucky enough to find a great online deal to stay at the peace lodge so i love this place. If you're not staying at the lodge, it is pricey to visit (I think it was about $200US for the 4 of us), but we spend the whole day and had a great time. We visited all the exhibits, did the waterfall hike, kids fished in their little pond, had lunch and watched the keeps feed the big cats. For lunch, I HIGHLY recommend skipping the buffet - its $17US and includes very little, instead head to the trout and have lunch there. It costs a bit more but they have a full menu and the food was great. The big cat feeding is done every day at around 430, right before the park closes. They don't really advertise it so you just kinda have to be there when the guy shows up. 

Food wise, we had pre-cooked food from the grocery store the first night and second night we ate at el sabor de montana (or something like that). Food was great and service was fantastic. Highly recommend if you're in the area. 

After another cold night (a bottle of wine helped) we got up the next morning and drove to Manuel Antonio. Drive was fine, mostly highway type driving. 

In MA, we spend 4 nights at Shana by the Beach. MA was interesting, very different vibe than other places we've been. Almost has a slightly Mediterranean feel, especially down the road that Shana is on. The hotel was gorgeous, we were upgraded to an ocean view suite with a full kitchen. Rooms are spotless and very spacious, with the exception of the bathroom. I was very surprised at how small the bathroom was compared to the rest of the room. One bathroom had a toilet and small sink, it was fine, but very little counter space. Other bathroom had a shower and sink. In this one, if you wanted to fully open or close the door you had to squeeze in behind it because there wasn't enough space for a person and the door! There were also no hooks or hangers for towels.  Huge, beautiful patio, with a 4-person table and a swinging egg chair. You have to keep your doors closed and locked at all times here because the monkeys know how to open them and will come raid your room! Shana had a great breakfast buffet, regular menu was fine, nothing amazing. Pools were great, though crazy warm, especially the family pool. 

We didn't do much in MA, mostly planned on chilling after a busy 9 days. Spent one day as Espadilla beach.  As others have said, the parking guys can be a little intense - they literally step into the road in front of your car and wave you to the side, which makes it seem like they are parking cops or officials of some sort. The first few guys were super aggressive which pissed my husband off a bit so we drove ahead, towards the southern end they weren't as bad and we stopped to speak to one guy who wasn't being pushy and he got a shady spot across from beach access for $10. We then paid another $30 for chairs and umbrellas. The plan here had been surf lessons for the kids and parasailing, but the water was really rough and the kids decided they just wanted to jump in the waves and go boogie boarding ($10/board rental). And to be clear, the water here is very rough strong waves and an undertow, if you're not a strong swimmer and/or are there with kids, stay shallow and stay very close to your kids. We live on an island, are strong swimmers and are ocean savvy, but i did not allow my kids in the water here without one of us. Also, don't wear hats, sunglasses or goggles while jumping in the waves - they will get knocked off and you will lose them. I found three pairs of sunglasses walking along the beach, sadly none were my husbands! 

We also spent a day on biesanz beach next to our hotel. This is a lovely little beach. Water is much calmer, but still had a fun waves for kids to play in. It is rather rocky, so I highly recommend water shoes here. It's about a 10-minute hike from the hotel down the beach, saw a ton of monkeys and birds on the trail. 

Otherwise, we did the jungle coaster. Or my husband and son did. Son said it was terrifying bu then did it three times. My daughter wanted to do the bike coaster, but she was too young to do herself and one of us with her exceeded the weight limit (none of us are very big, but they were very strict about the limit, which is fine). We also dropped into the ziplining, butterfly garden (forget the name, begins with a S) thinking we may zipline again, but found it a bit sketchy so just did the little hike to see the butterflies and crocodiles. I don't recommend, the crocodile pools are small and sad, my son was a bit upset at them. The butterfly pavilion had barely any butterflies and you can go there for free if you go to the cafe. Overall, would not recommend. 

Last thing we did in MA was get family photos on the beach with La Vida in Life Photography. We are not souvenir people, so decided to do this instead. I won't get the pictures for another few days, but from what I saw on her camera I have high hopes! The experience was fantastic, Cara (the photographer) was lovely. 

Food wise, we mostly ate at Shana or cooked. We had one lunch in town at el Wagon. Ate inside their train in the (super strong) AC, kids loved it. And we had dinner at El Avion to watch the sunset, which I highly recommend.

After that we drove up to Tamarindo to be closer to the airport for our last night. This was a slight miscalculation on my part, as I had been thinking tamarindo was a bit closer than what it was but no biggie! We stayed at hotel pasatiempo. It was fine, nothing fancy.  I wouldn't want to stay there for an extended stay, but as a last-minute booking it worked. We really only had an afternoon there so we headed to the beach. I was a bit surprised by the lack of services on the beach, no chairs to rent or activities, but i think that was because the day were there the wind was insane. We ended up just setting up on the sand and playing in the waves. Its a huge beautiful beach, and the water is very refreshing. We went to the far end, closer to playa langosta to get away from the rocks and and boats. That night we ate at ocean (great meal), watched a fire show on the beach and then went next door forget the name) to watch another fireshow/silk show. This was probably my daughters favourite part of the trip! Next morning, we poked around at some of the shops, but honestly with a few exceptions they all carry the same crap, then headed to liberia. 

Departure was easy, but it seemed like we got ahead of a huge group on Spirit airlines. 

A few special things to note:

\- Serving sizes at restaurants are huge! After a few days, we started sharing meals, and even then we often didn't finish everything. 

\- As many, many people have noted, CR is not a cheap vacation. Food is expensive, hotels are expensive, activities are expensive. However, i will note that you get what you pay for, the quality of almost everything we ate/did in CR was extremely high. 

\- Safety. We had zero issues or concerns. We just used common sense. 

\- Weather. La Fortuna and Poas were perfection. Manuel Antonio and Tamarindo were crazy hot, went above 40 (with humidity) several days while we were there. Be prepared, drink lots of water and wear lots of sunscreen! We had maybe an hour of rain the whole trip, didn't even unpack our rain jackets. 

\- Bugs. We had no issues, until we went to the beach. All of us had bites on our ankles. Didn't notice bugs or feel ourselves being bitten until the itching started. Nothing serious, just annoying. We took Benadryl and generously applied afterbite.

\- Driving. This isn't meant to scare anyone, but you have to be prepared. Outside of the few highways, the roads are very narrow, very twisty and very steep. There is little to no shoulder or guardrails in most areas, so you don't have any swerving room. Generally, we found Costa Rican drivers fantastic. But you have to watch out for some of the buses those guys drive like lunatics. Driving here is fine, as long as you are prepared and take all the warning you read on Reddit seriously! We used Waze almost exclusively, supplemented by google maps to double check or to plan. We found waze fantastic, it was spot on in predicting driving times. I found that the actual driving time was often longer than what you anticipate, even when planning using google maps or rome2rio, etc. So be prepared for that, and always give yourself some flex if you are doing longer drives. 

\- Internet. I cannot recommend getting a eSIM enoough! It was first time using these and they were great! We used airalo on both our phones - husband both 20G (for maps while driving) and I got 5G. We barely used any! If we had have just used roaming on our phones, it would have cost us about $500, our eSIMs cost about $100 total. Great option. 

\- MA national park. We bought our tickets in advance but decided not to do it. We went all that way to see the park, but by the time we got there we were hot and tired and my kids full on revolted against more hiking! We had seen lots of animals and decided not to bother. Part of me regrets it, mostly because we drove all the way down there, but on the other hand I recognize that we likely wouldn't have seen anything new or different. 

Despite the length, I'm probably forgetting a million things! I'm supposed to be working but writing this instead, haha! Feel free to ask me any questions and thank again for everyone's help in planning!",3,1743099951.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False
1jlav1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetOutOfBed/comments/1jlav1d/how_i_conquered_my_just_5_more_minutes_habit/,"How I Conquered My ""Just 5 More Minutes"" Habit Using a Task Management System","After spending years as a chronic snoozer who would hit that button 6-7 times every morning, I finally broke the cycle using an unexpected tool: Todoist. I want to share my journey in case it helps anyone else struggling with the daily battle of actually getting out of bed.

**Why I couldn't get up:**

* No real accountability for morning commitments
* Vague morning ""plans"" that were easy to postpone
* Nothing specific to look forward to in the early hours
* The overwhelming dread of an unstructured day ahead

# How I transformed my mornings:

I adapted the system from [this productivity guide](https://baizaar.tools/todoist-project-management-guide/) to focus specifically on creating a morning routine that pulls me out of bed instead of pushing myself with willpower alone.

**The system that changed everything:**

1. **Evening preparation ritual** \- I create 3-5 specific morning tasks the night before, broken down into extremely small steps (not just ""exercise"" but ""put on workout clothes"" → ""fill water bottle"" → ""do 10 minutes yoga"")
2. **Morning momentum project** \- A dedicated Todoist project just for my first 60 minutes awake, with sections for:
   * **First 5 Minutes** (tiny actions like ""drink water by bed"" or ""open curtains"")
   * **Next 25 Minutes** (bathroom routine, quick stretches)
   * **Final 30 Minutes** (the activities I actually look forward to like journaling or reading)
3. **Reward integration** \- I use Todoist's priority flags to highlight the rewarding tasks I genuinely enjoy (making my special coffee, listening to a favorite podcast) and place them strategically after the necessary-but-less-exciting tasks
4. **Visual progress** \- The satisfaction of checking off those small morning tasks creates momentum that carries into the day

The most powerful aspect has been how this system removes the need to make decisions while half-asleep. When my alarm goes off, I don't lie there contemplating the meaning of existence—I just open my phone, see ""drink water by bed"" as my first task, and start moving.

**My results after 2 months:**

* Haven't hit snooze once in the past 3 weeks
* Mornings have gone from my most dreaded time to my most productive
* Anxiety about the day ahead has decreased by \~80%
* I'm consistently getting up 90 minutes earlier than before

The guide I linked has a section about using ""time blocks"" which I've adapted for morning routines. Instead of scheduling ""7:00-7:30 AM: Morning Routine"" (which is too vague), I break down each small step with its own checkbox.

For anyone struggling to get out of bed, I've found that the issue isn't about discipline—it's about creating a structured system that removes decision fatigue and builds momentum from the very first minute you're awake.

**TLDR:** If you struggle to get out of bed, try creating an extremely detailed, step-by-step system for your first hour awake. Breaking down your morning into tiny, checkable tasks removes the thinking required when you're half-asleep and creates momentum through small wins.",2,1743099947.0,GetOutOfBed,0,1.0,False

# About us

We are iTales VR, an indie developer of virtual reality games. Right now, our entire team consists of 2 people who work on the project full-time. Sometimes, we get help from our former colleagues from the industry who expect to join us if the game starts generating tangible income or if we attract investments.

My partner Andrey (whom I have known for 15 years) does everything related to development: he draws both 2D and 3D art, and he also does programming in Unity. Before working on Dark Trip, he spent over 10 years working as a solo indie developer. Outside of gamedev, [Andrey does oil paintings,](https://kleninarts.com/fineart/) some of which ended up inside the game and play an important role in its plot and setting.

For my part, I act as the startup's CEO and a game producer, handling game design in general, as well as all issues not directly related to development: planning, release management, marketing, relations with journalists/bloggers, searching for partners/publishers/investors and negotiations with them.

We are both originally from Russia, but live in Bulgaria: me in Sofia, Andrey - on the Black Sea in Nessebar. Andrey has been living here for almost 7 years. I came to Sofia 3 years ago, some time after I completed the console port project of the Bulgarian game Phoenix Point, for which I was responsible while working at Saber.

Last spring, Andrey's old mobile projects stopped bringing him money, and in the summer, I was laid off during the restructuring of Embracer, the holding company that my Bulgarian employer had previously been a part of. As a result, creating a VR startup became a chance for us not to “die of hunger” in Europe in the context of the global crisis in the gamedev industry, when almost every day there is news about layoffs and studio closures (judging by the latest news, the crisis will not end in 2025).

# About the game

The game I am talking about is a VR escape room. Almost a month and a half ago, we [opened early access for it on Meta Store.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tnys13kIKc)

At the moment, the game's concept is formulated as follows:

*Dark Trip is a psych@delic escape room where a detective eats pills to solve puzzles and relies on own h@llucinations to investigate an eerie crime case. You take on the role of an investigator searching for a missing woman — and are forced to consume dr\*gs during your mission. Each room can be completed either sober or under the influence of psych@delics — this determines how you will have to solve the game's puzzles and what clues that reveal the plot you will be able to find.*

The key features are the following:

🔪**Solve Puzzles in an Eerie Environment.** Dive into a haunting world filled with grotesque biotechnological machinery and the wicked remnants of dark experiments.

🌀**Experiences psych@delic Trips.** Immerse yourself into mind-bending psych@delic trips that distort perception and twist your surroundings.

🔍**Use H@llucinations to Find Missing Evidence.** Search for clues, artifacts and diary pieces to discover the dark story behind the gruesome events.

The current version is available in Early Access and contains 9 rooms. The first playthrough will take the player from 1 to 2 hours, depending on their ingenuity and knowledge of spoilers. At the same time, the design assumes repeated playthroughs to find all the clues available in the game, which can provide about another hour of gameplay.

# Development history

Andrey started developing the project alone in the spring of 2024, after trying on the Quest 2 headset for the first time. In March, he downloaded the example project, inserted a scene from his old mobile game, and eventually found out that running a Unity project on the headset was not that difficult.

**Mobile ancestor**

The project that served as the basis for Dark Trip is [Supernatural Rooms,](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/supernatural-rooms/id895118542?l=ru) a mobile escape room that Andrey released back in late 2014, attempting to make a game for fans of the TV series “Supernatural”.

Initially, he planned to simply build the game for Quest 2, but over time it became clear that it was not enough to take and remake the touches to gestures in order to get an immersive experience. No conventions familiar to mobile controls and gameplay are suitable for virtual reality. The player's interaction with objects in the environment is a key feature: if there is a door or a drawer in front of you, you need to grab the handle and open it. If there is a switch, you need to pull the handle. What rotates, you need to rotate, and what is pressed, you need to press. Having understood this, my partner began a serious modification of the first rooms of the old game.

**First version for Quest**

The first version of the project for Meta Quest was ready by the end of May 2024 and was a direct port of Supernatural Room, including the first 10 rooms of the mobile project, the controls of which were adapted for virtual reality headsets and controllers.

In order to get that version, Andrey had to do the following:

1. Integrate the SDK for Meta Quest into the project;
2. Rework the controls from touches/taps to VR gestures;
3. Add cosmetic updates of the gameplay in accordance with the new controls;
4. Improve the graphics where objects appear in front of a player's eyes.

Initially, my partner was so impressed by the immersiveness of the headset gameplay in a Roomscale space that he did not even implement the ability to move the hero using joysticks. He considered Roomscale as the main mode, in which the player moved around virtual environments with his own feet.

As an industry standard, he added support for Locomotion for instant (or smooth, but often dizzying) movement to the key points in the room. Using Locomotion turns the game into a kinda point’n’click adventure.

We plan to add support for free movement with a joystick in the next update.

**WN Istanbul – first public showcase**

In early June 2024, together with Andrey we went to WN Istanbul. A couple of weeks before, he approached me with an offer to check a VR game he had made and asked me to help find a publisher or investor for this project. In response, I advised him to go to Istanbul together and work on solving these tasks at the conference.

By that time, I had already received a warning about the upcoming layoffs from Snapshot Games and was planning to go to WN Istanbul to give a postmortem on the Phoenix Point console port, as well as to hold several meetings with potential employers from Europe (running ahead, the job search meetings did not yield any results).

A few days before the conference, I visited Andrey in Nessebar and played the current version in the basement of his apartment building. At that time, I did not have enough experience working with VR games, and I was not aware of the current state of the industry and trends in it. But both the new headset from Zuckerberg and the game itself made a very strong impression on me.

Andrey received confirmation of the application for the showcase from the exhibition administration, and we were ready to go to the conference together: Andrey would show the game at the indie booth, and I, in addition to my lecture, would search for publishers and investors for Supernatural Rooms VR.

Two summer days in Istanbul flew by in a flash and by the end of the conference we had the following results:

1. Conference visitors testing the game at our booth gave mostly positive feedback.
2. There were no VR publishers at the conference. In addition to us, the virtual reality industry was represented by another indie developer, located at the neighboring booth. Almost all the other visitors to the exhibition, except for several employees of IO Interactive (to whom I came to woo as an applicant), were representatives of the mobile industry and were either operating or marketing mobile f2p games. We, with our project, turned out to be a black sheep at the conference.
3. But we managed to meet Rami Ismail personally. He played the game, gave it positive feedback and invited us to his recently created fund for indie developers. Subsequently, we wrote to this fund and to Rami himself several times, but no one responded to us.
4. On the second day of the conference, we met the manager of the Turkish gaming fund [WePlay Ventures](https://www.weplayventures.com/) – Dogan Zenginer. He also tested the game and also gave it positive feedback. We presented him the first draft pitch deck (which we made on the fly right before the exhibition), and he invited us to the We Play HUB Accelerator.

**Publishers’ feedback and WePlay HUB Accelerator**

While the documents were being prepared and the acceleration agreements with WePlay were being agreed upon, we were trying to create a very simple trailer. [It turned out like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH7uxQ-SfNY) (eventually we removed it from the studio’s youtube account feed).

I googled a list of major VR publishers and started sending them emails with the current trailer for the game, its current build, and the version of the pitch deck we had at that time. The list of publishers ready to work with VR looked like this:

1. Fireproof Games
2. Turbo Button
3. Overflow Games
4. Top Right Corner
5. Arvi VR
6. Pine Studio
7. Vertigo Games
8. Perp Games
9. Beyond Frames
10. Astrea
11. Enver Studio
12. Clique Games
13. My Dearest VR
14. 11 Bit Studios
15. Blowfish Studios
16. Tripwire Interactive
17. VRKiwi
18. NDreams
19. Fast Travel Publishing
20. Coffee Stain 

Almost none of the publishers responded to us. Only three publishers from the list started a correspondence, the result of which were the following conclusions:

* The publishers who responded were not interested in escape room games.
* Publishers were looking for f2p VR action games and shooters (everyone was and still is keeping an eye on Gorilla Tag and Ghosts of Tabor).

Looking for a way out of the situation, we decided that it was worth trying to quickly release the game that we had in stock, and then try to pitch new projects to publishers in accordance with their expectations.

As a result, in the fall of 2024, we went to the 5th batch of WePlay HUB with the goal of getting acceleration and releasing our game as soon as possible, checking how the market reacts to it and making further decisions based on the results.

Due to difficulties with release management in Meta Store (which I will talk about a little later), we fell far behind schedule. At the same time, thanks to Dogan's help, we were able to significantly polish our pitch deck and our investment plans in several iterations.

[Our pitch deck currently looks like this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qH42k0hlSSacXwJO0O_Z5Yy6bGWnyRiH/view?usp=drive_link) (it once again needs changes), and the plans mentioned there include the following key milestones:

1. Release the game in Early Access on Meta Store and start collecting the first revenue and wishlists on this platform (already done).
2. Open the Coming Soon page on Steam and start collecting wishlists on that platform (will be done in the next few days).
3. Within Early Access, expand the content of the existing game by releasing two large episodic updates during the year, tripling the existing content and refining the current features. In the process, accumulate enough wishlists and collect the loyal audience necessary for the full-featured release.
4. Get seed investment and find a publisher for the console version of the game.
5. At the end of spring 2026, make a multi-platform release, receiving a total revenue from all platforms in the amount of $1 million (apparently this is a very optimistic goal, but we remain chasing it).

With these plans, in October 2024 we began making the first announcements of the game on social networks and began preparing for the release in the Meta Store.

**Finding a niche: psych@delic gameplay, David Lynch, Terry Gilliam, and \_BD$M\_**

As I wrote above, the initial feedback from the VR publishers was that there were enough escape rooms on the market, and no one wanted to bother with another one. We received similar feedback from Redditors who responded to the first posts about the concept of the upcoming game.

It became clear that if we wanted to continue working on the existing game, and at the same time hope that it could get at least some attention from the market, we needed to come up with some really unusual features.

We brainstormed ideas for a few days. The idea that seemed interesting to us was the following:

1. Immersion is an important characteristic of VR games;
2. The gaming market as a whole has a steady trend of increasing popularity of simulators of anything;
3. If we think about what kind of “controversial” immersive simulator we could make to attract attention to the game - an idea immediately comes to mind: “a simulator of drug intoxication in VR”.

After a few days of discussion, we decided to stop at this idea and developed it into the formula of ​​a “psych@delic VR escape room”. We did some market research and found that in general there is a stable niche of “psych@delic” games with a wide range of projects, ranging from casual friendly and acclaimed Psychonauts, loved by a wide audience, to hardcore VR simulations of ayahuasca use.

I mentioned my partner's hobby above - oil painting. He has a rather specific taste and many of his paintings in one way or another involve \_BD$M\_ themes. That's why initially we decided to focus on this topic as well. Looking ahead, I will say that over time it became clear to us that although the theme of such practices allowed us to create an interesting and original setting, bringing it out as one of the key features was not the best idea. A little later I will tell you why.

But at that time we decided that the game would be a ""VR escape room about dr\*gs and \_BD$M\_"", in which Andrey's paintings would play an important role. Then we formulated the narrative plot as follows:

*“In a small German town, the only daughter of a retired businessman disappears. A player hired to investigate the case finds a seemingly abandoned laboratory. Exploring room after room, the player discovers evidence of experiments carried out in the place, notebooks left behind by both employees and test subjects.*

*It becomes clear that the infamous Nazi doctor Mengele conducted his inhuman experiments here using psych@delic substances and s@dom@sochi$tic practices. Moving deeper, the hero understands that despite the apparent abandonment, the laboratory is still active and the experiment continues: Olga (the kidnapped girl) and the player themself are in fact the active subjects of the evil occult ritual that is merging the infernal plane with our world causing bizarre sets where one can not distinguish h@llucinations from reality…”*

In terms of gameplay, we decided to focus on a rather unique feature, which was that the player could at any time take “psych@delic pills” and go into a state of expanded consciousness, in which the surrounding space changed and graphic post-effects of intoxication began to work.

We started to refine each of the rooms in the prototype, adding the effect of drug intoxication to them and refining the puzzles in such a way that they could be solved in two different ways.

At the same time, not all the prototype rooms that were available at that time were well designed, some were not good enough in terms of graphics and puzzle quality. Therefore, we cut out some of the content, hoping to improve it in the future. At the same time Andrey, inspired by Terry Gilliam's crazy movie ""Tideland"" (a dark fantasy drama about a girl who escapes into her imagination to cope with the harsh reality of dr\*g-@ddicted parents), added [an absolutely beautiful new room](https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1j9n92b/we_have_an_early_access_vr_escape_room_that/) to the game, made from scratch. For those who don't know, Terry Gilliam is the director of the cult ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" with Johnny Depp, in which the theme of dr\*gs use and adventures in fictional worlds under their influence is also a central theme.

**Female character development: too much \_BD$M\_, or a wrong turn**

In the original version that we showed in Istanbul, there were no characters other than a ghost girl, with whom the player interacted indirectly by solving a puzzle in one of the rooms. The girl was made very quickly and her “mobile roots” made themselves felt. When approaching her in VR, a player saw a crookedly made, poorly textured model, a legacy from a mobile project 10 years old.

Having decided that this character needed to be updated for a VR game, we approached the issue seriously and called for our former colleagues to develop a new girl.

Our joy knew no bounds when after some time we got [a very $exy Medium](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedevscreens/comments/1jgmlex/does_she_look_too_nutakuish_for_a_nonnutake_game/) (according to the plot, Mediums are young girls whom Mengele uses to activate the otherworldly powers of mysterious demonic paintings, which the antagonist plans to use for his sinister purposes). I expected that with such a character we would immediately win the love of the audience. However, the reality was as follows:

1. An overly u/xplicit image leads to the fact that YouTube and social media algorithms [automatically imposed audience restrictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1ipotpk/youtubes_double_standards_are_absolutely/) on any promotional materials that featured such a character.
2. The players from our target audience themselves, having seen the character, concluded that this was a game for Nutaku and one should most likely not expect an interesting plot and good gameplay from it.

As a result, recently we have decided not to use the current version of Medium in promotional materials (we are preparing an update release in which the character in the game will be dressed a little less revealingly), and for future marketing campaigns we are preparing an attractive, but less provocative female character with an image more in line with the genre of the game.  

# Meta Store release management

I have quite a lot of experience releasing mobile games as an indie developer. I also have experience releasing games on consoles as a producer at Saber, where I worked with large project teams, and special colleagues who were responsible for all release management issues. All this gave me some understanding of the tasks that we had to face with our first release on Meta Store.

**First game account**

In the second half of October 2024, we opened a “Coming Soon” page and started collecting wishlists in it, expecting that after some time we would be able to release the first version of the game in Early Access using the same account.

However, in the end (partly due to our mistakes, and partly due to the fact that many things in Meta Store are done very badly) we had to step on a lot of rakes.

**Early Access and Meta’s dev accounts set-up flow being broken**

At first glance, the Meta Store developer console interface is much more intuitive and convenient than the incredibly large Steam account management toolkit.

However, upon closer inspection, it turns out that many things in Meta work poorly. In our case, we encountered completely non-obvious problems with the launch of Early Access, which, as it seems to us, is still broken and can create serious problems for many other developers.

The thing is, the official Meta guidelines do not mention that the Early Access option can ONLY be activated when submitting an application for the first time (even if it is a ""Coming Soon"" page). And if a developer has already submitted a ""Coming Soon"" page, he will NEVER be able to activate Early Access later.

The EA activation button isn't in a prominent place — it's buried deep in the menu — and there's no explicit warning about these restrictions in either the developer console or the official guides.

Not being aware of this, we thought we had done our homework and thoroughly reviewed Meta’s official guidelines. These documents describe pre-launch tools, including Early Access, but none of them mention the restriction that Early Access must be enabled on the first submission. Instead, they vaguely state, ""There is an option to enable Early Access on the App Submission page in the Developer Dashboard.""

Not expecting a catch, we submitted a ""Coming Soon"" page, announced our game, and started marketing, assuming we could enable Early Access when we would be ready. When time came to activate Early Access, we tried to follow the instructions. But to our surprise, the EA activation checkbox was missing.

We contacted Meta support and were told that ""Early Access is only available during the initial application submission, and once the first application is submitted, it can no longer be cancelled."" The support attached a screenshot that indeed showed a warning about enabling Early Access only on the first submission. However, this warning only appears if the developer tries to activate EA themselves. If you follow the ""Coming Soon"" page path, you will never see it. This means that developers are only warned about the restriction when it is already too late. This was complete nonsense.

At that time, we were actively communicating with our acceleration manager at WePlay and asked him to try to help us. By a happy coincidence, Dogan was supposed to have a call with the Meta Account Manager, apparently responsible for the Turkish region, the other day.

We were over the moon when a few days later, in a [comment to our Reddit post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1h826tb/call_to_meta_quest_devs_is_metas_early_access/) which we made to see what other developers thought about this ridiculous practice, a fresh account came in and suggested that we take another look at the developer dashboard and see if there was an Early Access switch there. And there it was!

It was Friday and we, stunned with joy, decided not to rush and not to upload the submission, so as not to make some more unknown mistakes.

However, the situation developed even more absurdly, because on Monday, when we finally wanted to upload our Early Access page for review, the switch we needed was again missing. And the account manager Dogan contacted previously no longer responded to him.

As a result, we were forced to tear down the old page and create a new one from scratch, so that we could finally activate the option we needed and be sure that it would not magically disappear at the most unexpected moment.

**Oculus Start**

After some time, we received another long-awaited response from the Meta administration. Our application to the Oculus Start program was accepted.

We were again looking forward to something useful for business and for development, and again Meta let us down.

Membership in Oculus Start does not provide practically any benefits, except for access to an official closed community of developers in Discord, where you can share your successes and ask for advice from developers like you who are struggling with problems of Meta’s infrastructure. Essentially, it's the same r/okulusdev reddit, but in discord and by invitation.

Despite this disappointment, the Start Discord channel ended up being useful to us, because it was the advice of Start participants that we used to solve the problems we encountered when we had to optimize the game's performance. Without this optimization, the application would not pass Meta Store’s compliance.

# Indie marketing for Meta Quest game

Even before the submission of the first page of the game, we were facing the task to start marketing efforts. The following areas and channels were used by us:

* Website
* Social networks
* Mailchimp
* Keymelayer
* Expos participation

**Website**

We made the site using Tilda and launched three pages on it: the main page about the studio, the page about the game and the page with news, where we periodically published information about the main events that happened to us. Over time, another page was added to these - with a Privacy Policy, without which it was impossible to pass compliance upon release.

Tilda has a very convenient interface and allows you to create elegant and attractive sites without requiring any special skills. The basic version is absolutely free, Tilda Personal (which fully covers all the needs of an indie developer like us) costs $ 15 per month.

**Social media**

To promote the game, we opened accounts in the following social networks:

* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@iTalesVRStudio)
* [TikTok](http://tiktok.com/@dark_trip_vr)
* [X.com](http://x.com/ItalesVr)
* [Instagram](http://instagram.com/italesvr)
* [Discord](https://discord.gg/h5xnewgMXE)

**Mailchimp**

Mailchimp is an email marketing automation platform that helps automate communications with respondents. We use it to send out press releases.

I had an old database of gamedev journalists and bloggers from my mobile days. Before starting marketing our game, I cleaned it of “dead” contacts and added a few other spreadsheet bases collected by other indie developers (these spreadsheets are pretty easy to google).

Since the start of our work, we have sent out press releases dedicated to the following events:

1. Announcement of the upcoming Early Access of the game
2. Confirmation of the Early Access date
3. Early Access start notification plus the trailer
4. Our game winning at DevGamm Roast

The open rate of our press releases is on average about 38 percent.

Mailchimp service is convenient and I recommend it to other indies, it has a clear interface, includes ready-made templates for creating newsletters and detailed analytics of the effectiveness of campaigns. Previously, the free version completely covered all the needs of a small gamedev studio, but now only a paid (albeit inexpensive) subscription works. To service our base, consisting of about 800 contacts, we spend about $ 35 per month.

The service has good support. After activating your account, you can schedule a call with a user manager who will show and tell you how to export contacts, create and configure campaigns.

**Keymailer**

Keymailer is a service for sending keys for your game to content creators and influencers on social networks and for tracking the results of such campaigns. In my opinion, together with Reddit, Keymailer forms a pair of the most important tools for promoting an indie game in the absence of a full-fledged marketing budget.

In a nutshell, the service provides the following features:

* Set up a campaign page for your game to attract creators to it.
* Promote your campaign using free and paid methods on the Keymailer website.
* Receive requests from creators and decide whether to give them keys in response, based on coverage and trustworthiness statistics.
* Contact creators from the local database yourself and offer them keys.
* Contact media from the local database yourself and offer them keys.
* Track statistics of publications made after receiving a key from you.

Neither Andrey nor I have ever worked with Keymailer before. But Keymailer’s support team guided us very carefully and helped us in everything, starting from the moment of registering an account and up to the full launch of our first campaign.

**Expos participation**

As I wrote above, during the development of the first public version of the game, we went to WN Istabnul. In addition, a couple of weeks after the Early Access launch, I went to DevGAMM Gdansk, where I also held a showcase of the game, talked about the game to journalists and continued working on finding publishers and investors.

At the conference, I was lucky to meet the Editor-in-Chief of the Spanish version of the GameReactor portal and give him [an interview about our game.](https://www.gamereactor.eu/video/725383/Dark+Trip+-+DevGAMM+Gdansk+Game+Roast+Winner+Interview/)

After participating in DevGamm, we formulated the following summary for ourselves:

1. Almost everyone who tried the game liked it. Many hung out for a long time, continuing to play in the headset for half an hour or more.
2. The idea of ​​an escape room where you need to take psych@delic pills attracts attention.
3. All potential investors to whom we showed the game positively assessed the game itself and our progress in promoting it, but noted that at the moment there is no good way to do an exit from VR gamedev startups on the market - there are no major buyers on the market.
4. In a situation where the industry as a whole is in crisis, the number of deals and investment volumes are decreasing, a niche startup in VR does not look like an attractive investment object. 
5. On the contrary, many large players in the last few months have announced that they are reducing their participation in VR studios and VR projects. Plus the strange policy of Meta, which, instead of supporting the ecosystem of application developers for the Meta Store (see above about Oculus Start), focuses its efforts and investments on the Meta Horizon World virtual social network.

Given these results, in the near future we intend to open a Steam page for the future flat version of the game and make changes to our investment plans and pitch deck so as to stop positioning ourselves as a gamedev studio that specializes only on VR.

**Some fun**

In addition to serious business, there were also some frivolous entertainments at DevGamm: [we won the Roast ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/1j81hiv/our_dark_trip_won_game_roast_the_most_weirdest/)which is a stand-up battle in which indie developers fight with industry stars, and the losers have to drink weird cocktails made from hellish ingredients. 😄

# Current results and metrics 

Following the path described above, we came to the following results:

* **Keymailer Coverage:** 111 influencers received keys from us. Of these, 47 people created 83 publications about the game (reviews, letsplays and reels)
* **Subscribers in social networks:** in the few months since the announcement, the number of subscribers in our social networks has grown to the following values: Youtube: 41; Instagram: 95; X: 92; TikTok: 806
* **Views on YouTube:** we received 18K views of our trailers and shorts
* **Views and likes on TikTok:** we received 133K views and 5K likes (having spent several dozen dollars on promoting some of the posts)
* **Store ratings:** At the time of writing this review, the game has 24 ratings in the Store, with an average score of 4.6.
* **Store page metrics and conversions:** The total reach of the game page in the store is about 59K views. The conversion of reach into visits to the game page is awesome to be 8.3%, but the conversion of views into purchases is very poor and equals 2.67%. We still have not figured out what the reasons are. Is it related to the game's theme, to the fact that the game is in Early Access (and as a result, players add it to wishlists, and do not buy it) or some other reasons. We will have to figure this out in the near future.
* **Wishlists:** In 6 weeks from the start of early access, we have collected the first 1K wishlists. 
* **Downloads:** The game was downloaded by 450 users, including those who activated the keys received from us.
* **Sales:** In total, the early access version generated $3,200 in revenue.

# Conclusion

We started working on [our first VR game](https://vr.meta.me/s/saLsfsNg9Waov38) in late spring last year as an indie team of two founders. After receiving positive feedback from the first testers, but negative feedback from publishers citing oversaturation of the escape room market, we decided to try to release the game ourselves in the Meta Store in Early Access format.

We had to rework the idea of ​​the game, turning it from a more or less ordinary escape room into a psych@delic trip with original mechanics, in which the player can take pills and see h@llucinations while solving puzzles.

In December last year, we were ready to open Early Access, but encountered bureaucratic difficulties in the release management processes on Meta Store, as well as the fact that our game did not pass compliance due to performance issues.

As a result, on February 13th of this year, the Early Access release of Dark Trip finaly took place.

We were able to organize our own marketing channels, focusing on working on Reddit and sending keys via Keymailer, and in the first month and a half since the launch, we collected the first one thousand wishlists on Meta Store and received our first revenue of $3,200.

Now, 6 weeks after the game's release in Early Access, we are focused on the following tasks:

* **Launching a page on Steam.** In the coming days, we will finally activate the page of the flat version of the game on Steam to start collecting wishlists for it.
* **Refinement of the game's positioning, the design of its pages, and improving the conversion rate to purchases.** We will need to understand the reasons for the low conversion rate to purchases on the game's page on Meta Store and, based on the findings, refine the page.
* **Releasing new episodes in Early Access.** We will continue to release updates within Early Access, refining the existing features in the game based on players’ feedback and increasing the amount of content in the game. Our goal is to triple the number of rooms and levels over the next year and increase the playthrough time accordingly.
* **Search for an investor and/or publisher (including for a console release).** By continuing to increase revenue from early access on Meta Store and gathering wishlists on both platforms (Meta and Steam), we expect to strengthen our position in negotiations with potential publishers/investors and attract the funding necessary to continue working on the project and prepare its console versions.

Two weeks ago, we began meaningful negotiations with an European publisher specializing in puzzle games and escape rooms, which has successful experience in releasing both flat and VR projects, including on consoles. This together with having a “hard commitment” from WePlay HUB Accelerator to participate in a possible Seed round give us a positive perspective to achieve the goals. 

We will be glad if our story is interesting for indie devs, and [our game](https://vr.meta.me/s/saLsfsNg9Waov38) is liked by players! A huge thanks to everyone!",10,1743099769.0,gamedev,1,1.0,False

1jlas0i,https://i.redd.it/jje98qdgy9re1.jpeg,AIO for wanting to move out because of my parents.,"I’m adding this screenshot strictly because it’s from 30 minutes ago, and i’m just honestly trying to get outside perspective from people who have no emotional attachment to the situation. So I feel having it to read yourself might help. 

To get started, I (20yo F) moved in with my dad at 15 years old. My parents split when I was 3 and I was with my mom for the first 15 years and my brother and I were only seeing my dad every other weekend along with once a month during summers … & holidays were hit and miss. I am the oldest child, and my youngest sibling is 11 months. I have a brother (17) who lives with my mom still, and continues to only come every other weekend along with summers. 

Well basically to sum it up I want to move out because of a multitude of reasons but the main ones being 
1. I’m not allowed to get a second job on top of my full time job because they need me to be available to babysit and this makes it very hard to save money because i have to pay rent, car insurance, and my phone bill. 
2. they control what i wear and who i hangout with. i’m not allowed to wear anything that slightly even shows too much skin for them.. even if im just home chilling or in my room going to sleep. i have to be covered up. i’m also not allowed to talk to boys at all. no boyfriends.
3. my dad spies on me.. he’s always checking my location calling me wondering who i’m with and telling me if i don’t tell him every detail of my life he’ll hire a private investigator to find out.
4. they do not help me financially whatsoever… i know im 20 but i only make $15 an hour and after bills and after supplying all my own groceries and food and just any necessities i need anything at all i have to pay for and i cant save anything (plus they wont let me get a 2nd job)

i plan to move out back to my moms where i can work two jobs and save money for school or my own place or whatever i wanna do and stuff but im just scared of their reaction and response like idk maybe im overthinking and overreacting but i feel like its all too controlling and too much for me.",2,1743099740.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

by Nicholas Leonard

It might have been one of the strangest things to happen to Lynn, Peabody and Salem, and nothing quite like it has happened since. It was a fleeting incident that was talked about in a did you see that? kind of way, and not really talked about further. It was a singular occurrence that rippled through this essex county civilization like a benign earthquake. Most people were too distracted to see it going by, and only caught the tail end of it as it scattered down the street, for the human race is never ready for these sudden moments so sublime that they often border on horror. 
In April, 2022, Lila Concord happened upon a book of Corbin Chatterton’s poems in a moment of pure serendipity. Lila herself was 31, and played the organ at St.Mary’s church in Lynn, Massachusetts. She found the volume of Chatterton’s poems in the south branch of Peabody Library on a particularly warm day, sitting dusty and neglected behind a row of 19th century novels that included Wuthering Heights, Emma, and Far From The Madding The Crowd. Here this bygone poet hid behind the statues of the English greats; an American child playing in their shadow. She reached for this volume the way you’d reach to scoop up an injured mourning dove- something which had cooed outside her window that morning.
“Ohhh, I forgot we had that.” The elderly librarian cooed with her voice creaking with apology. Her eyes flew through her spectacles and onto the volume with both remembrance and inquiry. “Corbin Chatterton. He was born in Salem, you know. Buried somewhere in Pine Grove Cemetery in Lynn.”
“It was kind of hidden behind the English classics back there.” Lila explained.
The library took on the brevity of a bazaar. The librarian walked into her own memory to shill out a bargain. “Yes… he was an early romantic. He couldn’t quite seem to launch himself into literary stardom like some of the others though.”
Lila felt the injured mourning dove twitch its wings within her chest. “Ohh, what happened?” 
“I think it was in 1825 that he got very sick and died. It might’ve been consumption. His poetry lived on through small presses. I believe this volume is an original from 1823.”
“Can I check it out?”
“Honey, I don’t think anybody’s ever checked out this book. I myself even forgot it was there. I’ll let you have it for as long as you want.”
“Thank you. You said he was buried in Pine Grove Cemetery?”
“I believe so. Well, you see, originally he was buried in a potter’s field somewhere out in Danvers, but when Pine Grove was established in 1849, his surviving brother motioned for him to be moved there. His brother worked and worked to afford a proper tombstone for him then. I don’t remember where in Pine Grove he is exactly laid but he’s somewhere in there-”
“Alone.” Lila breathed.
“Naturally.” The librarian said, and took the book, opened it and stamped the receipt stuck inside the first page. It had no prior stamps. 
“What did this young man write about?”
“I haven’t flipped through that volume in a while. At first, he was obsessed with the sea, then I think he began going batty and started writing about love.”
“One has to be batty to write about love?” Lila snickered to herself.
“Batty as Corbin Chatterton.”
“Ma’am, um, how old was he?”
“I think early to mid twenties. He was an apprentice of some sorts before poetry whisked him away. He had no higher education, he was just one of those late symptoms of Shakespeare.”
Lila, having no response, turned the volume over in her hand -a movement that made her beaded bracelet jingle- and went, “I’ll have a look at it today. Thank you.” 
“You have a wonderful day, young lady, and enjoy this beautiful weather.”
She gave a charitable smile while stepping backwards towards the door. “Oh, I know. You too. Bye!” and she carried Corbin Chatterton back out into the world again, into Spring weather that the poets of romanticism would have gone hysterical for. 
She took the volume over to Pine Grove Cemetery, the grounds of which were enclosed by a tall cobblestone wall caked in moss. It was quieter than a library. All the tombstones, Madonna statues and crosses ranged from the kind of stone Medusa’s eyes introduced, to the polished copper pennies would never be again. She carried the volume over to a dip in the land where there was a turtle pond, frequented by ducks. She sat down on the lime green lawn where its rainwater smell welcomed her and all the turtles sunned themselves on the rocks in the pond. The turtles were such content aliens with black heads that had yellow stripes and eyes concentrated in an outer space serenity. Their content was contagious, and it put Lila in the proper mood to read poetry that was 199 years old. 
She read some verses aloud to herself as if to make sense of them. “They made eternity for only two. We mustn’t crowd the wedding thunderclouds. They made eternity for me and you.” She flipped to the next page. She was careful with her voice, knowing literature and poetry needed a diligent vessel, and that even reading poetry alone was still a responsibility, so her voice was meticulous as she read a new poem to the turtles.
“Today I set a cooing pigeon free. Into the radiant tomorrow flew… a dove to find my lover yet to be. I watched it near the sunset’s golden hoop… and joined its luster as the portal closed… to find a woman that I’ve yet to know.” Lila read, and she imagined a young man in a white blouse with loose cuffs donating a mourning dove to the sky in a celebratory manner. In her mind’s eye she saw the dove shrinking and shrinking as it flew away until it vanished- and she thought about the mourning dove that had been cooing outside of her window that morning. It ached her because she could only imagine the majority of this pigeon freer battling the identity crisis of being a silhouette; faint stripes of sunset light to break up the shadows on his figure. She could picture him releasing the bird, and she could picture him being 80% silhouette even though the poem stated absolutely nothing about it.
“Hm. That was a short one.” She said to the turtles, then she started another poem. 
“I hear the organ but it’s far away. I hear her rosary is jingling. Oh what a gallows is a maiden’s wrist? A future knuckle that I haven’t kissed. The organ music jumps between our times. I hear the thunderclouds distort its hymns… which would’ve played the day our wedding day. A sound no church in Salem claimed to make. I asked the organist to play again, and imitated what I heard to him, oh but the hymn I heard must not exist, for what he played I didn’t recognize. But still sometimes the humming leaves my lips, and though alone in love I am today.”
The poem finished and something came over. “It does exist!” She shouted at the open volume. That line oh but the hymn I heard must not exist caused this aggravation in her. She had shouted this with the air of being in the thralls of a romantic quarrel; a couple arguing in a kitchen, but she was just in front of the turtle pond in Pine Grove Cemetery. She had sounded so desperate to get some phantom husband to realize something, but all she did was make the sunning turtles retract their heads into their shells. 
The beads of her bracelet jingled when she turned the page.
“Beyond the universe’s growing pains… the nebulas who take so long to stretch… I think my Love is in the future days… and woe that just my ghost will know her breath.” She mumbled, the poetry having administered some assedative to her narration voice. “Corbin.” She whined sympathetically under her breath. She brushed her fingers over the tan page as if to disrupt the seeds out of the poetry, but all the words had already been planted and sprouted. 
She looked up from her volume and at the turtles. They were just now starting to poke their heads back out with the languid speed of sunrises. She felt as slow as them. She returned her attention to the poetry and read quietly, no longer reading aloud so as to keep her from shouting again. 
She ended up remaining quiet for so long that the turtles might have started believing that she was one of the Madonna statues of Pine Grove, if a Madonna statue got up, sat down and took off her shawl
The volume was 121 pages. Some pages had two poems on them, some had just one on it, and some poems rambled on for two or three pages. They weren’t all about this strange long distance relationship the poet had, but some were mundane and about nature- typical poet things. Some were about mortality,  were celebrations of Jesus’ sacrifice, but most of those 121 pages harbored poems of this strange long distance romance. And when Lila had time to feel what she read, the analytical part of her mind started awake, which only deepened her curiosity. 
“Oh, honey, I said you could keep that book for longer.” The librarian cheered when Lila entered the south branch Peabody library the next day. The librarian’s face was red and puffy with joy while Lila, Lila, everything about Lila was alive. The beads on her wrist jangled as she stomped- not walked, and her black tresses bounced. She had gotten a little pink from sitting in the sun yesterday and now there were 121 pages of poetry in her eyes. She looked angry to have not known about the volume sooner. 
“Have you ever shouted at a book?” Lila asked, to which the librarian shrugged. “Not in here, not since I was a girl, but yes plenty of times.”
“When the narrator was wrong about something?”
“Honey, I find sometimes the narrator is often right, we just don’t know how to accept it yet. That’s how you know it’s a great story. Why? Did Corbin Chatterton ruffle your feathers?”
Lila didn’t answer, instead she looked down at the volume and thought of the line that made her shout. Oh but the hymn I heard must not exist. She didn’t shout now, but felt her unbridled rebuttal echo within her. “I guess he moved me.” She admitted. 
The librarian’s smile was enough to make the April sky outside even bluer. 
“I just needed someone to talk to with about this collection.” Lila said in another admission. 
“Well, I’m certainly not busy now.” The librarian said. “Looks like it's just us in here, honey. Why don’t we dissect some of it together?”
“I would like that.” Lila said, and though separated by age, the two shared similar smiles. 
The librarian waddled out from behind her desk, and the two sat at a table with rustic rainbows of book spines shelved behind them. They went through the poems that affected Lila the most, but the whole time someone was knocking on the door of a cottage in her mind. She did her best to ignore it because she wanted to be polite and nod while the librarian read a poem, gave her two cents on it and then read and analyzed another.
“I think this one summarizes Corbin’s feeling of how the realization of existence is constant. See here, ‘a string in time my fingers interrupt. I feel, not hear, the summer air I pluck.’ Jeez, that’s beautiful, isn’t it?”
“It is.” Lila agreed, but where did that pride in her voice come from? 
“‘Play on, the great nothing I wrote myself. Today’s tranquility will be enough.’” the librarian read. “‘The pointer finger plucks, the middle plucks- and then sometimes it twitches in my thumb.’ Ahhh, see, I love that.” The librarian held up her hand and wiggled her fingers, drawing a pleasant chuckle from Lila. 
“Is this the only work of his you have?”
“I can call the main branch and see if they have any of his other collections, but yes, as far as I know you are in possession of the only Corbin Chatterton work we have in the south branch.”
“Very interesting.” Lila said thoughtfully, her eyes consulting the closed volume on the table. “Do you have any idea of where he’s buried?”
“No, honey. I’m sorry to say I don’t. As I’ve said before, he’s in Pine Grove, but I’m not sure which section or lot he’s in.”
“I think I’m going to go looking for him.”
The librarian sounded sorry that she had to laugh. “Honey, there’s almost one hundred thousand people buried there. That place is over 80 acres.”
“And? How many poets are buried there?”
This made the librarian think. She spoke after a moment of consideration. “I will say, you can veer from the military sections as I do know he didn’t serve. It’ll most likely be an old tombstone. I’m not sure how legible the name and date will be, or if there will even be a name on it. Are you sure you want to do this, honey?”
“I feel like I have to now after reading him.” Lila said, but then she snickered, and the snicker seemed to be hastily trying to fasten a mask over her face. She dipped her head and looked back down at the closed volume. 

“Where are you, Corbin?” Lila asked herself that afternoon while she was walking through Pine Grove was a pen and a red notebook in her hand, which she was planning to write a composition in, but she didn’t want to start writing it until she found the poet’s grave. Maybe creativity was equaled by Death, and she wouldn’t be able to find him. The only good thing was that it was a beautiful Spring day, and the smell of the freshly cut cemetery lawns dispelled the grasses’ earthy breaths. She applied sunblock on her shoulders, so that smell was there too but the cold smell of the sunblock had gotten shy in the presence of the smell of the grass. 
She walked and looked. She passed down the rows of tombstones, walked the hills and ignored the moppy-headed trees that tried tempting her with their shade. The sheer amount of tombstones quieted her, and the more she walked, the more she began to feel that this one cemetery seemed bigger than Massachusetts itself. It also distorted her sense of time after seeing the collection of dates, all embedded in stone like a thousand different chinese fortunes, but they all ended up saying the same thing, which was this person was born and then they died, and this person was born and then they died. The numerical possibility of her own species almost put her in a trance would have made forget what she was looking for, but, just like she had found the volume by chance, she found his grave. 
It was uphill, standing short with castle-like posture. Corbin Chatterton 1801-1825 read the tombstone. The letters were only visible because they had been carved and the wrinkles of the tombstone had not caught up with the cinzel masonry yet. Atop the hill was a large oak with branches that sprawled out to form an umbrella over the daycare of tombstones. Corbin’s tombstone was 80% shadows, broken up by the 20% sunlight that managed to cut through the leaves. It was comforting to know that this tombstone had a ballet of sunlight and shadows to play on it all this time.
Lila took a breath and sat down beside Corbin’s tombstone, opened up her notebook and began to write, humming different notes and progressions to herself quietly so as not to disturb the dead. She wrote many movements and variations of the same movement, humming to herself and making corrections along the way, sometimes even starting all over again. What she was doing was composing more than a poem. Poetry is for the conscious, music is for the subconscious, thus explaining the almost torpid state she entered into while inspiration whisked her away; her pen the whip that kept the steeds in flight- that’s what Corbin would’ve said. 
She practiced on the keyboard in her room that night, making corrections and changes to her sonata along the way. Halfway through the composition, she decided on titling it as Corbin's Sonata. Its melodic and somber tones were hindered by the prissy range of the keyboard, but she knew it would sound all the better on the organ in St.Mary’s. Still, even when she played it on the keyboard at 3 in the morning, she couldn’t help but remember how she had imagined the silhouette of a man striped in sunset orange that almost revealed his identity, releasing a mourning dove up into the sky. 
Corbin might have described the sonata as having come from a sunset. It sounded like a triumphant but subtle happy ending to life cut short. 

“Father Calabasas, do you mind if I try something out on the organ today?” She asked the next day while standing in the belly of St.Mary’s. Father Calabasas was in his black cossack with the white neck tie. His eyes, piercing, his skin, pale, and his voice of some central European and slightly vampiric original. 
Father Calabasas drew his pale aurora borealis eyes up to the indoor balcony of the church where the organ was. Its brass pipes and their many frowns was always quite the thing to see, and the machine always had monstrous promise to it.
“Why, sure. I don’t see why not, Ms.Concord. Is it practice you seek?” said the priest with Dunkin coffee on his breath. 
She hesitated, almost dropping her red notebook. “I wanted to try writing something.”
“Oh. Ohhhh! Well, I was about to go out and trim some of the bushes in the parking lot, but if you want someone to give it a listen-”
“I’m good, Father.” She said warmly. “I don’t want to keep you.”
“I will most likely be able to hear it out there anyway.” He said and patted her shoulder before bumbling out of the church, ready to grass stain his black pants. 
Lila turned behind the confessional booth and took a flight of stairs that was in a cramped shute where the church’s anatomy was that of wood and not of brilliant marble and granite that are the colors of far off temples. She proceeded to the organ like it was any other morning in mass and sat down, opening up her notebook before her. There was more opportunity on an organ than on a piano or a keyboard, and the title she had written above the sonata seemed so promising aboard the steampunk style instrument: Corbin’s Sonata. 
That moment when her hands hovered down towards the keys was such a detrimental silence. It was like sitting in the theater and truly not being able to determine the ending of the movie. For one reason or another, her fingers hovered there for a moment. She might have imagined the man who was mostly silhouette elating underneath an orange watercolor sky. Maybe sunsets were redder back then when the tragedy of Salem was fresher in the sky, however the sky was bright blue that day in Lynn. 
Her fingers pressed down on the corresponding keys, and immediately the pipes came to life. It was like a resurrection for the wrongly died. 
The swarm was a swarm that seemed to have started nowhere. It was in a hurry through Essex County, tens of thousands of mourning doves all in a violent commute not just above the streets but through them. A lady who had been walking her little dog ducked and laid on her stomach when the swarm passed. All their wings were so fast and small that it was amazing that wings as thin as playing cards could let such plump doves accelerate the way they did. Cars lurched to respective stops in that intersection that the Witch House in Salem is. The swarm was such a brief reflection on their windshields. From here, the swarm ascended but seemed indifferent to flying too high. No. These birds’ business was not in the sky. 
The swarm slithered and winded through residential neighborhoods, some where nobody saw them and some where people did. They curved up and over buildings when they had to but always came curving back down, slinking in roller coaster finesse to wherever they were going. 
The librarian in the south branch Peabody library was too involved in the book she was reading to see the blur traffic past the window, but its sound alerted her and she looked up from her book when it was too late with a couple of patrons doing the same. 
Horns honked. A child reached out of their stroller and giggled with the two budding teeth it had. Dogs yipped not out of malice but out of an absurd understanding with nature. The falcons that hid in trees stayed themselves from chasing the swarm. Seagulls in the many pothole infested parking lots remained grounded. 
Father Calabasas was intrigued with the sound that was coming from his church while he stooped over to weed a strip of mulch from which some hedges grew. It enhanced his gardening duties. The music sounded as misunderstood as Toccata and Fugue, triumphant as 99 Red Balloons, and as tickling as Vivaldi, and Lila’s fingers tickled on the keys as if she had been playing it all this time. Perhaps the song was always in her, that’s why she played it so well- she just had to write it down for it to exist. Exist. It did exist. Her pleading shout at the turtle pond had been worthwhile. 
The more the sound came out of the church with the attitude of a newly wedded couple, and the more Father Calabasas progressed down the row of hedges, the more he wished that the piece was something that he could play in his car. He wished he had it to listen to on his way to Dunks, on his way to church, on his way to the houses of the elderly when supplying communion. 
Something cut the air. A shadow entered down the street that St.Mary’s was on, and Father Calabasas turned to see the swarm of mourning doves shooting towards the church. Being not afraid, he stood still and watched the swarm fill the space between houses, the sound of all their wings unfolding and folding the air. The swarm was as long as an unwinded fingerprint, and it took a while for the entire swarm to amalgamate around St.Mary’s. It created an everturning vortex around it, flying, flying, flying in a circle. When the swarm was finished arriving, Father Calabasas stepped back and craned his neck, watching the tornado of mourning doves churn. They all flew so fast but so elegantly without crashing into one another that it seemed they had the grace of fighter jets, oh but this was a peaceful thing. 
The priest watched with his jaw dropped until Corbin’s Sonata ended in the sorrowful chuckle of some apologetic but happy notes, and the swarm started uncoiling itself from the church. This took some time as well, given the length of the swarm, but eventually the church was rid of it, and the swarm ascended until it became faint as smoke, growing smaller and smaller until Father Calabasas saw nothing but a blue April sky. 
But how strange it was to see one mourning dove falling out of the air, its wings working rapidly to cool its re-entry. It landed on a telephone wire and looked down at the priest. It looked at him and cooed like a curious cat.
“Oh, your wings must be tired, little friend.” The priest said despite the distance between him and the telephone wire.
And like that, it ended; Lila’s fingers retreating from the keys. The only sound in the church was the faint jingle of the beads on her wrist. Had she seen the swarm outside the stained-glass windows? I am not sure. We have to leave her now, but I think she sensed us. Part of her must’ve heard our wings berate the air and send feathery winds against the church. 

“I saw a swarm of mourning doves crusade
in unison into the candle clouds.
Their little wings have such a sky to break,
their little wings against their bellies pound.”

Then: a flicker. A voice.

*""Police are urging caution tonight as the body count linked to the so-called ‘Mimic’ rises to eleven. The suspect is described as a shapeshifter—""*

*click.* 

Graham turned the volume down and reached for the half-empty bottle on the cluttered coffee table. It stuck to his fingers with the sweat of old condensation. The apartment smelled like cigarettes, spilled beer, and unopened mail. Dust coated everything like a second skin.

The anchorwoman’s face moved silently behind the mute screen, lips forming warnings too late for anyone to heed.

Graham leaned back into the couch, a groan escaping his ribs. He’d been trying to quit drinking for three years. Mostly he just quit trying.

Outside, the streetlamp flickered.

Inside, the hallway light flickered too.

Not unusual. Old wiring. Cheap rent. Still—his eyes caught the way the shadows shifted against the far wall. Like someone had passed by.

He waited. Nothing. Just the groan of pipes, the sigh of his building exhaling.

He swigged from the bottle. Gritty. Burnt. Familiar.

There had been a girl once. Elise. She used to sit cross-legged on this couch, hair like ink bleeding into water. She told him once that people only change if they want to. But Graham knew better now. Some people change just fine. Right into other people.

He got up to piss and left the TV on.

*""—most recent victim found in their home, door locked from the inside. No signs of forced entry. Authorities speculate the killer may gain access by—""*

The bathroom mirror caught him sideways. His own reflection startled him. Eyes too bloodshot. Cheekbones he didn’t remember earning.

He flushed. Washed his hands.

When he opened the door, Elise was sitting on the couch.

“Hey,” she said, like she’d just stepped out for a cigarette and come back.

Graham froze in the doorway, one hand still damp.

“Elise?”

“Yeah.” Her voice was soft, almost sheepish. “I know it’s been a while.”

He walked toward her slowly, knees stiff, bottle still clutched in his free hand.

“You died,” he said.

She looked at him with those soft, dark eyes. Exactly like hers. Exactly.

“I got better.”

He laughed, too loudly. The kind of laugh that scrapes the back of your throat.

“Bullshit,” he said. “You’re not her.”

Elise tilted her head. “No?”

He watched her blink. Once. Then again—longer. Slower. When she opened her eyes, they weren’t hers anymore.

They were his.

I would like to know how people would teach said junior for them to learn faster.

Got into an AI project building some kind of transcription->summary service. The only experience I have with using AI is like extending those tutorials that teaches you how to have AI search the web and return summarized results with sources.

Now, it's been like almost week and I haven't made progress on a task that (from what I understood from the docs and asking the seniors) is kind of like:
AI Agent gets a raw transcript->Summarizes that transcript
My task would be to extend that to:
AI Agent gets a raw transcript->Summarizes that transcript->Pick out specific parts of the summary to present based on criteria.

Now I'm trying to break down the part where the LLM summarizes and trying to figure out how it works and what it outputs but I'm afraid it's gonna take me like a few weeks to a month for me to finish building this new thing.

Felt so dumb and drained I dipped my donut in a glass of water instead of coffee. So, that's my new low right now. Any tips or like approaches I can take to tackle this problem?
I use AI as well, I've sat behind my monitor for hours reading AI generated code and responses to the point where I'm just vibe coding and reviewing and no longer looking at the code base (I should probably take a rest). Initially, I actually tried to code for a bit then have AI generate tests then the cycle continued until I was feeding AI my own code, it hallucinating imports, me trying to fix it, feeding it back to AI, and the cycle continued till I got out of work earlier.

idk man it's kinda discouraging at this point (I pivoted for like an hour earlier also to fix some frontend issues that maybe helped me get through the day without loosing my mind completely ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯) ",0,1743099563.0,webdev,10,0.33,False

It was the only explanation she had for what she was seeing right now. That or a cosplay convention – and since when did cons host in a middle-of-nowhere town still recovering from the Outsiders?  
  
*Stay calm. Don't freak.* She nervously adjusted her Grab-And-Gulp cashier's uniform, taking a moment to try and make sense of the situation. *They're just customers. Nothing strange about them whatsoever.*  
  
Or so she told herself, pointedly ignoring how most of them were wearing clothes seemingly ripped from a medieval fantasy show.  
  
Even setting aside how they were dressed, the fact that they were here at *all* was already a huge surprise. Who in their right mind got up at 6 AM for the overpriced garbage this store called food? People weren't meant to exist before the sun had fully risen. It was inhumane self-torture, and anyone willing to subject themselves to it was a walking red flag.  
  
Lisa didn't count. Much like most college students, she needed the extra cash by any means necessary, and this was the only place willing to hire someone with a resume as barren as hers.  
  
*Not my fault the fucking planet got invaded by monsters,* she seethed. *Kinda makes it hard to find work when society is imploding! Try telling that to referral companies, though. Bunch of pompous pricks – oh shit the cosplayers are here.*  
  
Pushing her lips up into a strained cashier-friendly smile, Lisa greeted her customers with the exuberance that 6 AM deserved. ""Hello. Welcome to Grab-And-Gulp. Please try our new cinnamon pretzel bucket. Limited time offer.""  
  
Their group of six stopped several feet away. One of them – a guy around Lisa's age – stepped forward. She quickly focused her attention on him, because the other five were breaking her brain.  
  
""Nice to meet you,"" he greeted, as if nothing was out of the ordinary. His eyes traveled up to the menu hanging above. ""Mind if we take a couple minutes to browse? My friends aren't from around here.""  
  
Lisa swallowed an anxious laugh before it could escape. She really, really didn't like what 'not from around here' implied.  
  
""No problem."" *They're just cosplayers.* ""Take your time."" *Just. Cosplayers.* ""Let me know if you need anything."" *You're not a child, Lisa! Elves aren't real!*  
  
Of course, monsters hadn't been real before the Outsiders invaded...and those pointy ears looked *way* too realistic to be an outfit.  
  
Standing right behind the only normal dude were four honest-to-god elves. One guy, one girl – also around Lisa's age – and two younger kids that seemed to be in their mid-teens. All four had lithe frames, short statures, and silver-white hair. They didn't waste any movement as they walked forward, their perfect postures lending them an air of unearthly speed and fluidity.  
  
As if that wasn't enough, the sixth member of their group was some sort of dragon-lady. She had vibrant golden hair, piercing eyes, scales covering half her skin, and a tall, intimidating physique that screamed 'amazonian goddess'. The woman couldn't have looked more different than her friends, but somehow, she didn't feel out of place among them.  
  
To an extent, most of their physical characteristics and medieval-style attire could've been excused as cosplay wizardry. Lisa had seen pictures online that were basically magic. Makeup, prosthetics, and digital editing could seriously work wonders.  
  
Yet even those touched-up images couldn't compare to the five not-humans silently examining Grab-And-Gulp's menu. The elves and dragon lady felt as if they'd jumped straight out of Photoshop and into reality. It was almost uncanny how flawless their features were.  
  
Like they were *designed* to look that way.  
  
Frankly, the older girl elf was making Lisa feel inadequate, and she wasn't someone who lacked confidence in her appearance. *Shit, I think the \*guy\* elf is making me feel inadequate too. What the fuck even ARE those eyelashes?!*  
  
""What do you suggest, Rob?"" the elf girl suddenly asked, glancing over at their group's lone bastion of normalcy. ""Many of these words are foreign to me. Cinnamon, chocolate...is salt the same here as in Elatra? Never had the chance to sample it back home.""  
  
""It's a lot more common on Earth,"" the guy – Rob – clarified. ""You might as well try a little bit of everything. That's the whole reason we came here.""  
  
Lisa was immediately struck by four thoughts in rapid succession.  
  
The first thought was that, improbably, impossibly, she'd been right. Those five people weren't human. Weren't *from Earth.* Her part-time corner store gig had just become ground zero for an international incident.  
  
The second was that she'd maybe seen Rob before – although she couldn't quite remember where.  
  
The third was that she should call 911. Now. While these Outsiders were much easier on the eyes than the last batch of creatures that visited Earth, they were still Outsiders. The police had to know. And the government, and the freaking President. If Lisa were smart, she would've quietly excused herself and started sprinting before the elves or dragon lady randomly turned hostile.  
  
The fourth was screw *that*, because this was the most interesting thing to happen to her in two decades of living.  
  
""Might I suggest our Variety Pack?"" From the depths of her beleaguered soul, Lisa somehow managed to locate her customer service voice, speaking to the Outsiders in a chipper, upbeat tone. ""It's on sale today.""  
  
""Still way more expensive than two years ago,"" Rob muttered to himself. A moment later, his face brightened, shining with a mixture of glee and schadenfreude. ""Which is why we're on the government's dime. If Chase doesn't want me racking up fees, then he'd better start implementing some of my *suggestions*.""  
  
*Government's dime? Chase?* Before Lisa could parse what he was saying, Rob whipped out a silver credit card from his pocket. The motion looked so ridiculously quick that it was like his body was on fast-forward. ""Six variety packs, please."" He reached over the counter, politely handing his card to her.  
  
She almost turned and ran.  
  
It wasn't a conscious thought. For one brief, terrible instant, Lisa's instincts had *screeched* at her to flee. Every bone in her body resonated with horror, telling her that she was in grave danger. That an apex predator was nearby. That an avatar of death was mere inches away, patiently waiting for her to take his credit card.  
  
Then she blinked, and the moment was gone.  
  
Shaking her head, Lisa processed Rob's order and started heating up six freeze-dried meals. *Weird. Must've had too much coffee earlier. Or not enough.*  
  
To be fair, the arrival of five beauty-pageant-winning Outsiders was probably affecting her nerves more than she'd realized. *Need to get my head in the game.* This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; she couldn't blow it by making an ass of herself in public. Again.  
  
Besides – out of everyone here, from the graceful elves to the imposing dragon lady, Rob definitely wasn't who she should be focusing on. He was the chaperone, the normal one.  
  
*...I think.*  
  
\--  
  
Grab-And-Gulp's patented Variety Packs™ were an unholy smorgasbord of flavors that prioritized quantity over quality. You wouldn't have known that from the way Rob's group peered at the kitchen, though. Their eyes were borderline reverential as they sniffed the carbohydrate-filled air.  
  
Lisa did her best to ignore them and get their meals ready. However, it was difficult to tune out an otherworldly peanut gallery who thought that heating up a stove merited excited pointing and hushed whispering. For a hot minute, their over-the-top reactions halfway convinced her that she was, like, an actual chef.  
  
Then she reminded herself that she couldn't handle anything more complicated than pressing On and watching a timer.  
  
""Is that an Enchanted Item?"" one of the kids asked – the young elf girl. Her eyes sparkled with interest, as if she wanted to jump into the kitchen, dismantle the oven, and puzzle out how it worked. ""One of those...electrical devices?""  
  
Lisa shamelessly eavesdropped as she worked, doing her utmost to pretend that she was invisible. It was shocking what people would casually reveal when they were 'just' around staff. In her weeks at Grab-And-Gulp, she'd overheard scandalous gossip from customers that you couldn't have *tortured* out of them otherwise.  
  
""Yup,"" Rob answered. ""Pretty much everything on Earth that seems like magic will be an electrical device. Even if it's glowing. Remember, no mana means no Artificers or Enchanted Items.""  
  
Concern entered his gaze. ""You guys are doing okay, right? No issues with mana deprivation?""  
  
The five fantasy folk all nodded in unison. ""Galling as it is to be barred from casting spells,"" the elf girl grumbled, ""I understand the necessity. We'll be judicious with our MP reserves. Promise.""  
  
Next to her, the other kid – an elf boy – smiled. ""I'll be here to ensure she honors that promise.""  
  
""Why do you need to *ensure* anything?!""  
  
""Because I know you, Malika. You'd summon lightning for the first Human who doubted your prowess – or requested an exhibition.""  
  
*Malika.* Lisa froze as she heard the name spoken by the girl's...brother? They totally had that teasing sibling energy. If not family, then close friends.  
  
*They're people,* she thought, truly comprehending that fact for the first time. These weren't just unknowable Outsiders. They were *people*, with friends and family and social lives.  
  
And if she made a bad impression, they would go back to wherever they'd come from and tell everyone that Earth sucked – especially that annoying loser Lisa. She'd condemn her entire goddamn planet to a negative interdimensional Yelp review. 1 Star, Dislike, Do Not Recommend. *This...this is...*  
  
So far above her pay grade that it wasn't funny.  
  
""This restaurant's head cook is quite skilled,"" the dragon lady added, with a glance of approval. ""She is clearly a master of her profession if she can prepare six meals so efficiently.""  
  
...But hey, in for a penny, in for a pound. These were still the nicest people Lisa had talked to in ages, and she only slightly minded how depressing that sounded.  
  
Her eavesdropping continued, with Lisa gradually picking up bits and pieces of info. The dragon lady was named Meyneth, and the young elf boy was Orn'tol. Malika and Orn'tol were *absolutely* siblings.  
  
The older elf boy was called Vul'to. She couldn't get a bead his personality; he'd barely spoken three sentences. Maybe he was the strong silent type, content to sit back and watch as long as everyone else was happy?  
  
As for the older elf girl–  
  
""Return my greatsword.""  
  
Rob aimed a wry grin at her. ""We've been over this, Keira.""  
  
The elf narrowed her eyes. ""You claimed that I shouldn't carry a visible weapon with me, as it would 'spook the locals'. I *graciously* acquiesced, deferring to your knowledge of Earth cultural mores.""  
  
She swept her arm out, gesturing at the empty Grab-And-Gulp parking lot. ""Where, pray tell, are the Earth locals? What's the purpose of hiding if there's no one to hide from?""  
  
""It's early in the day – more people could show up soon. We won't be here for long, so hang in there.""  
  
Lisa leaned closer, drinking in their conversation like a dying woman at an oasis. This wasn't quite *drama*, but it was enthralling nonetheless. Rob and Keira seemed completely at ease around each other...  
  
To the point where alarm bells were blaring inside her head. *No way, are they–*  
  
""Fine,"" the elf muttered. ""Very well. My torture continues, unceasing and unabated.""  
  
Rob faltered. ""How much of that was sarcasm?""  
  
""I am exaggerating...somewhat. Nevertheless, being separated from my greatsword like this is *not* a pleasant experience.""  
  
Keira grimaced, tapping her leg with a hint of nervous energy. ""It isn't uncommon for Combat Class users to grow inordinately attached to their chosen implement of war. Think of Zamira's blade, Malika's magic. Like them, my sword is a source of comfort, solace, and relief.""  
  
""Right."" Rob winced. ""Sorry, wouldn't have asked if I'd known it would be *that* bad. Guess this was a bit of a blind spot for me.""  
  
""That's because you're a deranged lunatic of a fighter whose 'chosen implement of war' is whatever explosives are within throwing range.""  
  
""Aw, thanks. And on that note, I'd be pissed as hell if my Firebombs were somehow removed from my Bound Items, so I do get where you're coming from.""  
  
Having reached a decision, Rob extended his arm out. Lisa observed curiously as–  
  
There was a flash of a blue light.  
  
A giant fucking sword appeared in his hand.  
  
Lisa resisted the urge to rub her eyes. The greatsword was a large hunk of dense metal, so thick that it looked more suited for smashing things than cutting them. If she'd tried to lift it, she probably would've snapped her spine like a twig.  
  
Rob was effortlessly holding it up. As if it was made of cardboard. He handed the oversized weapon to Keira – who, for the record, was two inches shorter than Lisa.  
  
The elf seized it with both hands and a wide smile. ""Much obliged,"" she purred, fastening the greatsword onto her back with practiced ease.  
  
*I...need to take a picture of this.* Maybe it was a defense mechanism from seeing yet another impossible sight, but Lisa felt driven to document this moment for posterity. She hurriedly peered down to grab her phone from her pocket.  
  
When she looked back up, Keira was staring directly at her.  
  
To her credit – and despite being scrutinized by a drop-dead gorgeous elf – Lisa didn't panic. Her neurons had been fried so badly that they'd looped back to serenity. ""Can I help you?"" she asked, with surprising nonchalance.  
  
""I merely wanted to apologize if my greatsword's presence is distressing,"" Keira said, wearing a contrite expression. ""While it is of importance to me, I understand that denizens of Earth may interpret Elatran weapons as a threat. If it would help assuage any fears: I solemnly vow that no harm shall come to you this day.""  
  
*Stay calm. Don't be a spaz. You can't possibly bomb this worse than your last job interview.*  
  
""No problems here,"" Lisa remarked. ""Cool sword. It...uh...looks heavy.""  
  
The elf put on a savage grin. ""That it is.""  
  
For reasons she didn't fully grasp, Lisa got the sense that she'd scored Keira brownie points.  
  
\--  
  
""Now, I know none of you are gonna listen to me,"" Rob admitted, ""but eat *slowly*. Savor the flavors. Elatra doesn't have most of them, so take the time to figure out what your favorite is.""  
  
Lisa watched as Keira, Meyneth, Vul'to, Malika, and Orn'tol gingerly poked their forks at the Variety Packs. They each selected a flavor at random, taking small, guarded bites.  
  
Ten seconds later, all caution had been thrown to the wind. Pretzels were devoured. Cinnamon rolls were reduced to atoms. The group ate with the voracity of sugar-induced twelve-year-olds, demolishing their meals at a frenzied, ravenous pace.  
  
From the safety of her kitchen, Lisa quietly began heating up six more Variety Packs.  
  
""Astounding,"" Meyneth proclaimed. She shoved a handful of ultra spicy nachos into her mouth, heedless of the tears welling in her eyes. ""Is this considered gourmet food on Earth, Rob?""  
  
The human paused, glancing down at his tray of prepackaged dreck. ""...It is in my heart.""  
  
Vul'to nodded insistently. ""I am in agreement. This was worth undergoing life-threatening Soul Surgery to regain my Elven body. Couldn't have journeyed to Earth were I still a Fiend.""  
  
He sent a kind, angelic smile towards the kitchen. ""My thanks for the wonderful food, Lisa – that is your name, correct? It's written on the tag attached to your garments.""  
  
""Yup! Thaaat's me!"" She shyly waved, then turned away, mentally kicking herself. *Don't bother. Just look at him! 'Out of your league' doesn't even begin to describe it.*  
  
*Also, he's a potentially dangerous Outsider, which is important too I guess.*  
  
""Speaking of Fiends..."" Blue light flashed again as Rob's food suddenly disappeared. ""Promised Faelynn I would bring her some of Earth's finest delicacies. Be back in a sec.""  
  
More blue light. This time, Rob himself disappeared. None of his friends seemed to be disturbed by that.  
  
They were proven right five minutes later when he popped back into existence. ""Delivery complete. If this Leader of Fiend territory thing doesn't pan out, I could make a killing on cross-world Doordash.""  
  
*Ah. He teleported. To another world, apparently.*  
  
Lisa shrugged with acceptance. No need to question every little detail – not when the crazy train was still heading full-speed down the tracks.  
  
""How *are* Zamira and Faelynn faring?"" Keira asked, mumbling through a mouth full of chocolate. ""I've asked, but I can never tell if they're lying to assuage my concerns.""  
  
Rob gave her a thumbs-up. ""They're doing good. Took a while for some territories to 'get' the concept of humanitarian aid, but I think the Order of Zamira is really starting to pick up momentum.""  
  
""Didn't Zamira ask people not to call it that?""  
  
""Yeah, but everyone still does. She also refuses to visit Earth unless Faelynn can too, which is adorable. Based on how the both of them reacted to the food I delivered, I think they'll be petitioning an Artificer for a solution sooner rather than later. Either that or contacting Malika for a custom-made spell.""  
  
Out of nowhere, Malika stopped eating, her face stricken with guilt.  
  
""I'm wasting too much time here,"" she whispered. ""There's so many endeavors I could be furthering right now. Have to help the Skills, and the Fiends, and–""  
  
""Malika."" Orn'tol placed a soothing hand on her shoulder. ""Would you say that a Ranger should never stop training, even when their muscles are strained, overburdened, and at the brink of lifelong injury?""  
  
  
She lowered her gaze. ""No.""  
  
""Well, your mind is the same. It needs *rest*. If you don't make time for yourself, then how will you have Stamina for when it matters most?""  
  
""But–""  
  
""You've earned this day. Now reap your rewards."" Orn'tol pushed a pile of cinnamon bites towards her. ""As a wise man once spoke: savor the flavor.""  
  
Malika hesitated only briefly before devouring her food with renewed fervor.  
  
None of the Variety Packs lasted much longer than that. Lisa would've been impressed if she hadn't survived multiple Saturday night rushes by now. Rob's group could pack away a meal – especially with how enthusiastic they were – but they couldn't match drunk sports fans who'd just watched their team lose, seeking to drown their sorrows in cholesterol.  
  
""I believe I'd like to visit Earth more often,"" Keira declared, with a look of utter satisfaction. ""Are you certain I don't owe this establishment any coin, Rob?""  
  
""Yup. El Presidente has got us covered."" He smiled. ""Besides, paying for the occasional meal is part of my official boyfriend duties...though I'm not sure it counts if it's with someone else's money.""  
  
""We're Combat Class users. Purchasing gifts with funds plundered from an enemy is the height of romance.""  
  
*I KNEW IT.* Lisa fist-pumped behind the counter, feeling a sense of petty victory over her accurate prediction. *They're an item!* She'd *definitely* gotten that vibe from them! Would've called it even earlier if they weren't so...  
  
She struggled to think of a kinder word than 'mismatched'. No offense to Rob, he wasn't *bad* looking or anything, but Keira was a smokeshow. Vul'to too. Meyneth wasn't quite Lisa's type, but the cashier still recognized hotness when she saw it, and she knew some people who'd go positively bananas for an amazonian dragon lady.  
  
*Is everyone from their world hot? How is that fair at all? What kind of game does Rob have to land a literal elf?*  
  
*Hold on, if Keira is dating him, then do they think \*humans\* are hot? Hmm. Is Vul'to single? Could I have a chance with him?*  
  
It was an intrusive thought – yet rather than weed it out, Lisa chose to let the idea plant roots in her brain. Despite her reservations, it was growing more appealing by the second.  
  
*Stay calm. Don't jump the gun. Are you really going to rizz up an unknown, alien Outsider just because he reminds you of your childhood crush on Legolas?*  
  
She didn't even need to answer that question.  
  
Before Lisa could decide on her plan of attack, though, Rob got up and walked over to the counter. ""Thanks for being chill about all this,"" he said to her, sounding genuinely grateful. ""I imagine you've got tons of questions you've been dying to ask.""  
  
""Oh, uh, just a few–""  
  
Lisa cut herself off, squinting at Rob's face. ""Wait...*now* I remember you! You're the guy who vanished into a portal! It was at the college near here.""  
  
Not her college, of course. Rob's campus had been shut down by the government shortly after his disappearing act. Lisa was attending a respectable school where students didn't get eaten alive by magic gateways to who knows where. She wouldn't have joined a haunted death-college even if it offered free tuition.  
  
Okay, *maybe* if it'd offered.  
  
Rob scratched the back of his head, a complicated expression on his face. ""Guess you saw my picture?""  
  
""Who hasn't? Your face dominated the news for, like, a solid month."" And then later again, when his connection to Jason Miller revitalized interest in the incident.  
  
*Are they still in touch? If I ask, could Rob get my Red Blur figurine autographed?*  
  
""I'll keep that in mind,"" he sighed. ""At least it took you twenty minutes to recognize me.""  
  
Lisa tapped her chin. ""Would've been faster if I'd remembered your real name. For some reason, I always thought it was Roy.""  
  
Silence. Rob's mouth opened, but he didn't speak for some time.  
  
""You have *got* to be shitting me,"" he finally said.  
  
Their talk was interrupted by a loud, heavy sigh from Malika. ""Earth food is dangerous,"" the young elf complained. ""I love when it's here, but now I'm sad that it's gone.""  
  
Her eyes widened. ""Can we have *more?*""  
  
The five Elatrans all whipped around to stare at Lisa – and into the kitchen behind her. They looked eager, practically salivating at the thought. The human took an instinctive step back, as if she were a gazelle being sized up by a pack of hungry lions.  
  
""Cool your jets,"" Rob said, holding up both palms. ""Figured this might happen. Let's take our time getting you guys used to Earth food. It's why I didn't order seconds.""  
  
""But I already made seconds.""  
  
The words had spilled out of Lisa's lips before she could stop them. Realizing that she now was the center of attention, she hastily pressed on. ""I've got six Variety Packs that are just about ready. With how excited everyone was, well, I thought you'd want more?""  
  
Rob frowned. ""I mean, it's not like it would *hurt* them, but–""  
  
""I'm willing to pay if he isn't."" Keira fished some metal coins out of her pocket. ""Are these sufficient compensation?""  
  
""You too, Keira?""  
  
""I refuse to be denied more cinnamon rolls. If there are consequences, I shall bear them with pride.""  
  
In that moment, Lisa realized she was on the cusp of something important. A crossroads of her life. She didn't know *why*, just that it *was*.  
  
*Is Rob right? Should I cut them off? Not that I could stop people who lift giant swords like paperweights, but...they apparently think I own this place, and they seem really respectful. If I tell them to leave, they probably will.*  
  
Whatever response she'd been considering was blown away when she caught sight of Vul'to. The elf was looking directly at her, his gaze pleading, hopeful, and sincere.

President Holder's personal cell phone rang.  
  
He cursed loudly as the noise disturbed his concentration, then cursed again when he noticed the name on its caller ID. The second-most-powerful man in the world almost muted his phone, desiring nothing more than to hurl it into the nearest ravine.  
  
Instead, he pressed the Accept icon and held it to his ear. ""Hello, Rob.""  
  
""Hey there, Chase. How's work? Made any progress on my suggestions?""  
  
President Holder ground his teeth so tightly that it was a miracle they didn't crack. ""I'm. *Trying.* You don't have the faintest idea of how difficult it is to force Congress to agree on anything. It's like herding hundreds of feral wet cats.""  
  
Subject Delta hummed to himself. ""Fair. You've got some leeway for now – and that wasn't why I called, regardless.""  
  
Brushing past the ominous 'for now', Holder sighed. ""Then what's so important you would contact me this early in the day?""  
  
""Just...thought you should have some forewarning. I brought my friends on a field trip, and things sorta–""  
  
The door to Holder's office burst open. ""Mr. President,"" Winston panted, breathing heavily. ""Check the news. Any channel.""  
  
As Subject Delta went suspiciously quiet, Holder followed Winston's advice, turning on a widescreen TV embedded into the side wall. It was set to his favorite news network – the one that was most favorable to him, naturally.  
  
A migraine had already started forming when he was only halfway through the first headline.  
  
*NEW OUTSIDERS INVADING EARTH?*  
  
Right above its intentionally panic-inciting announcement, the channel was playing clear-as-day video feed of five Elatrans. Four elves, and one...dragonkin, if he remembered the term correctly. The Elatrans were standing inside the kitchen of a dilapidated Grab-And-Gulp.  
  
All hell had broken loose. Food was strewn about the floor without care. The kitchen's oven had been taken apart by a young elf girl, examining its pieces with an intense gaze as she absentmindedly ate potato chips. A young elf boy was assisting her, munching from the same pile.  
  
Another elf, older than the last two, was using her overly-large blade as a dinner plate for a massive pile of cinnamon bites. The dragonkin was challenging herself with the spiciest menu items on offer. One Grab-And-Gulp employee could be seen among the Elatrans – a freckled blonde human attempting to chat up yet *another* elf, who was ignoring her in favor of inhaling an entire tub of pretzel rolls.  
  
Finally, off to the side, there was Subject Delta. Posture stiff, arms crossed...and desperately fighting against the smile creeping onto his face.  
  
President Holder felt his blood pressure rising. As morbid curiosity got the better of him, he rapidly flipped through more channels.  
  
*THE NEW OUTSIDERS: FRIEND OR FOE?*  
  
*PORTAL BOY REAPPEARS! RED BLUR UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT!*  
  
*CONFIRMED: ELVES REAL! WE WEREN'T CRAZY!*  
  
*IS FAST FOOD THE KEY TO INTRA-DIMENSIONAL PEACE?*  
  
""Soooo..."" An easygoing voice crackled through Holder's phone. ""Your PR department can handle this, right?""  
  
*God damnit, Rob.*

1jlap41,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jlap41/my_first_confession_hoping_my_sins_will_wash_away/,My First Confession: Hoping My Sins Will Wash Away,"Hey, I can hear your folks playing that large piano over there. Fine tune, I must say. It’s called an organ, right?

Oh right. Sorry. I should start with the traditional phrase.

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

A terrible sin. 

I feel like everyone knows what I’ve done. I’ve seen people, walking down the street, just stop whatever they’re doing when I’m near, and just stare at me. Just freakin’ stare at me. Even people who I don’t know or who are not from around these parts just stop and stare at me.

And they won’t stop. It’s been a month and they won’t stop. I’ve even seen people follow me. Once, I saw a guy turn around the corner with his pickup while I was driving to the grocery store. I panicked after he followed me for maybe four blocks or so. After that, I turned and drove through an obscure part of town. That’s when he stopped following me.

It all started when my eight-year-old daughter, Danielle, told me she saw mommy with another man at the mall two months ago. I didn’t believe her at first because I knew my wife better than anyone else, especially since we’ve been together for 21 years. We loved each other very much and were devoted to each other.

However, on that very day, I did take my daughter to the mall because she needed new shoes for gym class. That’s when I saw my wife, Arlene, with another guy. I don’t recall her telling me about it except that she would be busy today.

I brushed it off at first because there was no way that she would cheat on me. But I had to be sure. So, I took my daughter to the mall’s indoor playground and told her to play around and not to leave until I got back.

She’s such a sweet little thing, my daughter.

Anyways, I followed them around. They had coffee with some pastries at the local bakery, visited the religious section at the bookstore, and even hung out at the small community garden just outside the mall.

After a few hours, I saw Arlene hug the man and they said their farewells. I followed the man and saw him stop by the small communal Christian shrine in the gardens. He kneeled down and started praying while holding those beads in his hands.

At that time, relief sort of washed over me, you know. I couldn’t believe that this guy would ever commit adultery, let alone with my wife.

Then I kept seeing this guy always hanging around near my house. Washing his car, mowing the lawn, wearing his robes before walking to the church. He’s always there!

I didn’t like that at all. And neither did Danielle. She said that this guy is always bothering her. That he always offers her lollipops and cookies. That he and his daughter always invite her into their house.

It’s funny, I never talked to my wife about it. I probably should have.

But something was wrong with that man. I know something is wrong. There has to be.

When Danielle told me that she saw him with mommy again, I snapped. In the middle of the night, I took my daughter’s advice. I grabbed my gas canister and my lighter, poured gas on his lawn in the shape of a pentagram, poured gasoline around his house, then set it ablaze.

That night, the whole neighborhood was burning bright. I could feel the heat all over my face. I ran away while hearing the horrifying sounds of screaming in the house. I regretted my decision right away. But not enough to confess my crime to anyone.

The next day, Father, that’s when everything started to go wrong for me. It began with seeing Arlene crying over the news of our new neighbors being burnt alive in their own home. The news anchor reported that a satanic cult called the Black Robed Tribe was responsible for this heinous crime, given their iconic signature: a pentagram burned into the ground.

Ignoring the news, I questioned my wife if she knew those people. Arlene claimed that they were her cousin, Marcus, and his daughter, Gabrielle. They had moved here from Italy, hoping to start a new life. Marcus wanted to continue his path as a bishop of the Catholic faith.

I replied to her, saying that I didn’t believe her. I told her that our daughter had seen her cheating on me with another man and that this same man was harassing our daughter.

The reaction from my wife baffles me to this day. She told me that we have no daughter. She insisted that she had only met him at the mall and had informed me about it. She even showed me text messages on my phone to confirm her story.

After that, she left the house in such wrath and in such tears. I was left in a confused state, you know.

I remember turning around to watch the TV and contemplate my actions when I saw my daughter—or not my daughter—Danielle, or rather her face pops up on TV. The news anchor claimed that she had been the leader of this cult for 47 years. Her face looked the same as my eight-year-old daughter. But what I remember most is that I thought I saw the face on the TV move her eyes towards me. And it started to form a smile.

I figured I must have been imagining things.

My wife has not returned to me since that day. I haven’t seen my daughter either. She must have taken her. I hope they're both doing okay. I tried reaching them by phone, but all I get is voicemail.

Ever since then, you remember that I mentioned to you about people just staring at me. Well, that’s when it started. Recently, these people have started pointing at me too. They seem to be mouthing something to me, not saying a damn word.

I keep hearing the flapping of large wings all around me during my rare visits to the grocery store. It’s louder than my radio put to the max. Once, I even saw this large pristine white feather fall from the sky onto the hood of my car. I looked up, seeing no bird in the sky. Not even a cloud or plane. Just nothing.

Today, it got worse. The flapping sounds got so loud, so intense. It’s deafening. But there’s nothing in the sky. The feathers become more frequent now. It’s like wherever I go, the road is paved with them. I brought one to you so you can see.

Give me a second, I will get it out of my pocket. Wait. No. It’s not there.

Anyways, these people who point at me, people whom I know or don’t know, now say something to me. I think they keep saying ""judgement day"" or something. I don’t know, Father, it’s really freaking me out.

Now they’re starting to follow me. I ran into your church, hoping to find sanctuary. But I feel that I will have to own up to my mistakes. I keep delaying it, but I can’t anymore.

Father, you have known me for a long time. Ever since I was a child. You also know that I am an agnostic person, even though I was brought up by a loving Christian family. So, it’s very rare for me to come to church.

I feel lost. Astray. Somehow I feel manipulated, deceived. I don’t know why. Maybe because I am so weak.

Father, what should I do?

Maybe I should run away. That’s it! That’s the answer, right?

Father?

I didn’t realize how long I’ve been talking. Your folks stopped playing the organ.

Father, are you okay? Why are you growling?

You know what Father, I uh, I better go.

*The cash spent was only because I liked carrying cash for a few cash only places however it wasn’t that common – I ended up just randomly chose to pay in cash sometimes to not bring back any. Which was a bit of a mistake post trip as its harder to remember what that amount was spent on.*  
  
***Total Hotel Cost:***

*A lot of people will tell you to book your tickets in person but I am extremely happy to not follow that advice. Each Shinkansen we got in was extremely packed and even booking the tickets a week prior we saw that a lot of the seat selections was already taken. We DID NOT USE KLOOK, we used the official SmartEX app and paired our Apple Wallet Sucia cards to our Shinkansen tickets. Which allowed us to tap and go – only possible with SmartEX to my knowledge. I also noticed that Klook was more expensive than SmartEX. For the Kansai Pass, we also booked the seats a week prior and got the tickets along with the Area Pass when we picked it up in Kyoto.*

**Day 0, Monday: Seattle to Asakusa -**

***From the ANA Flight Review:***  
I didn't get on the Pikachu plane Sadly. This was my first international flight ever and the first time being on a plane this big (three rows wowed me) I was honestly shocked by how much space economy had compared to US domestic flights. Though, on the way back, I realized that space disappears fast when people actually recline their seats—something the passengers in front of us did not do on the way there.

***Airport to Hotel:***  
I chose Asakusa for the first night because of the direct train from the airport and its relatively close distance to Tokyo Station. Since we had one day in Tokyo to settle in and do some pre-trip shopping, this made things easier.

Finding the right train line at Terminal 3 was a bit confusing. We found the ticket machine but kept walking down a pair of escalators, which was clearly wrong. Turns out, the turnstiles were right next to the ticket machine, but we missed them because a huge crowd of people was blocking the view. Thankfully, we had Suica pre-loaded on Apple Wallet, so it was just a tap-and-go situation (though I struggled to find where to my tap phone at first—a nice person helped me out).

We got off near Asakusa Station and took a short walk through the temple to our hotel, which was absolutely gorgeous at night. Checked into Onyado Nono Asakusa Natural Hot Spring, dropped off our luggage, grabbed the free hotel noodles, and immediately went to Donki to stock up on snacks. Ended the night with a soak in the onsen and a Lawson egg sando, which we *did not not* Like because of a weird mustard taste.  
  
**Day 1, Tuesday: Asakusa, Ueno –**  
  
I woke up an hour earlier than my girlfriend each day for some solo exploration, which worked out great for grabbing cash and a pre-breakfast snack. First stop: Feb's Coffee, where I finally got to try Japanese flan. It's a bit different from the Cuban flan I grew up with—more watery and jello-like.

Sensoji Temple – Holy shit. We absolutely loved this place. The whole experience—we did the full experience with the proper hand cleansing to the incense ritual and prayer—was super fun and immersive. We did omikuji (fortune slips), and I somehow pulled the best possible fortune (so obviously, I didn't do another fortune the rest of the trip LOL). My girlfriend, on the other hand, got the second-worst fortune which meant she had to tie hers down. We picked up some charms afterward—she got a bell for luck, and I grabbed a cool transparent blue one from the smaller temple next to Sensoji.

We strolled down Nakamise Street, which wasn't too busy, but a lot of the stalls were selling mass-produced junk, and some of the food vendors seemed kinda sketchy. However, we stumbled across Kibidango Azuma, and wow—soybean flour mochi shocked me with how good it was*.* Absolutely loved it, wish I had gotten more. Big fan of soybean flour.

At the end of the market, we went up to the Asakusa Culture Tourist Center Observation Terrace for a great panoramic view of the area. From there, we walked through the back streets to Nishi-Sando where we tried the viral melonpan and Giraffa Asakusa curry—both underwhelming. This kinda killed our appetite, so we skipped lunch and headed to Ueno early.

Before leaving Asakusa, I stopped by the hotel to grab our checked bag and planned to take it to a nearby Yamato store, but the front desk told me they could handle it for me instead—huge win, saved me time.  
  
By the time we arrived, the weather started getting gloomy and drizzly, so we browsed some shops before strolling through Ueno Park. Came across some cool spots, like mini torii gates and a small temple. Originally, we planned to check out the National Museum, but we were too excited to keep exploring and decided to skip it. Looking back, I kinda regret that, since the weather got worse, and we didn't enjoy Ueno as much because of it(We didnt have an umbrella).

We ducked into Uniqlo/GU So I could grab a few basic items. Highly recommend the seamless boxers—so comfy and way better priced than in the US. The Uniqlo building also had a food court on the top floor, so we decided to rest our feet and get out of the rain. Unfortunately, BOTEJYU Okachimachi was a total miss—my okonomiyaki and highball were mid at best, which sucked considering there were much better food options nearby.

***Asakusa Hotel Review – Onyado Nono Asakusa Natural Hot Springs: 8/10***  
Super fun hotel, and the free noodles was shockingly good. The whole ""take off your shoes at the lobby"" thing was cool at first, but the novelty wore off when I forgot something in the room or just wanted to step out for a second. Also, I was constantly paranoid about ruining the tatami mats. The queen-size room was spacious enough, and the onsen was great—though having some random tourists try to chat with me while I was trying to relax was awkward. That said, everyone followed the showering rules properly, which (as I later found out) wasn't always the case throughout my trip.

**Day 2, Wednesday: Nara (omizutori fire festival)–**

We had a bullet train scheduled for 7:30 AM to Kyoto, so we started the day early and checked out around 6 AM. Originally, I planned to use Uber to hail a taxi, but luckily, there was one waiting right outside the hotel. In the worst Japanese possible, I asked, ""Tokyo Station okay?"" “Card okay?” Which made the driver laugh. He got us there with 40 minutes to spare.

We considered getting ekibens, but we love our western carb-heavy breakfast, so we opted for McDonald's at the station instead. Of course, we had to try all the limited-edition breakfast items they had.

Navigating Tokyo Station wasn’t an issue since I had already marked the exact platform we needed and confirmed it using Navitime app. (Google Maps was unreliable and often failed to find the exact train.) Also, I highly recommend this [PiQtour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht2I2_SU2fQ&t=44s), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht2I2\_SU2fQ&t=44s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht2I2_SU2fQ&t=44s) which made getting to the platform a breeze. We boarded and realized that we were the only foreigners in the cabin. What really shocked me was how Quiet The train was – I loved it.

Along the way, the clouds parted just long enough for us to catch a glimpse of Mt. Fuji! It reminded me a lot of Washington's Mt. Rainier. The 2-hour, 30-minute ride flew by—I was glued to the window the entire time.

Once we arrived at Kyoto Station, we picked up our Kansai-Hiroshima Area Pass first. That turned out to be a smart move since, since the line moved very slow and grew. I felt bad for the staff because it seemed like everyone was giving them a hard time. When I got up to the counter, I simply handed over my printed reservations, and they quickly processed everything, handed me our passes, and explained how to use them.

While picking up my pass at the same counter, I noticed the exclusive Astro Boy sakura ICOCA IC card and picked one up for the novelty. The card itself was $5, but you’re required to load it with $25, making the total $30. I didn’t use it for transit but instead spent the $25 on a split purchase at the Nintendo Store later in the trip.

From there, we walked over to the Mitsui Garden Hotel next to the station. One of the main reasons I picked this hotel chain was their bag shipping service—if you’re staying at another Mitsui Garden location, they’ll send your luggage ahead for only $5 per bag. So, we handed over our bags, which were sent directly to Mitsui Garden Hotel Shinmachi Bettei, where we’d be staying later that night.

Now bagless, we took the Kintetsu Limited Express to Nara for the deer park and the Omizutori Fire Festival. It was a bit confusing at first, but a kind station worker literally walked us through the whole process—helping us buy tickets and even guiding us to the correct train. We were blown away by the level of service and waved a huge thanks as we boarded. The limited express was well worth the small price, getting us to Nara in 30 minutes and much closer to the park than the JR station.

The restaurant I had planned for lunch was closed, likely due to the festival, so we grabbed some konbini food instead. On the way, I stumbled across a shop selling Tabis which were made in Japan and impulse-bought a pair.

At the park, we made a quick stop at Kōfuku-ji before heading to Kasuga-taisha Shrine. Along the way, we got deer biscuits and were immediately Attacked by the near by deer, which forced us to buy more. We had to hide them until we got further in, where the deer actually bowed before taking the food. The ones near the entrance were way more aggressive, probably because most tourists don't know you're supposed to bow first and just handed over the biscuits.

When we reached Kasuga-taisha Shrine, we were a little disappointed to find the main lantern attraction roped off. It seemed like a special event was happening — there were young men in white kimonos alongside the priests, possibly something related to the Omizutori festival? Even so, the walk there was relaxing and gorgeous. (A bit muddy due to the rain, avoid white sneakers!)

From there, we took a different path through Nara Park toward Tōdai-ji, passing a small street lined with shops. Most were closed, but we grabbed some egg sandos from 若草山パレット, - solid 7/10, much-needed fuel.

Tōdai-ji itself was just as epic as I imagined. Photos do not Do the Great Buddha justice—it's Massive. We spent so much time just walking around in awe. I had completely forgotten this was also the temple with the enlightenment pillar hole! Watching people squeeze through was fun, and the crowd was cheering for everyone. My girlfriend and I both managed to do it—it’s a lot harder than it looks!

After that, we did short hiked up to Tōdai-ji Nigatsu-dō, the main viewing area for the Otaimatsu torch-burning ceremony. We arrived around 5:15 PM and secured a good spot in line. The crowd was sizable but mostly locals. The festival started around 7:40 PM with a short explanation in Japanese, follow by Korean, Chinese and English. Then, everything went dark as they lit the torch and carried it to the corner of the temple. Groups were allowed to walk underneath it, though we were kept at a bit of a distance, and the police were managing the crowd quickly. The whole process of walking underneath took less than a minute, but it was still fun! I just wish I had brought a small book to read while waiting—or had a better eSIM. (My girlfriend, who used Chris Abroad's eSIM, had no issues, while mine wasn't loading anything.)

After the festival, we were funneled out of the park and ended up on an bus that had just arrived to Kintetsu-Nara Station. The trip back took a while, requiring a transfer to the Kintetsu Kyoto Line and then a local train (K) to our hotel.  
  
**Day 3, Thursday: Kyoto (Philosopher path, Gion, Fushimi Inari) -**

I ended up swapping my onsen time to the morning, highly recommend it if you want to basically have it all to yourself—it was a great way to start the day. For our full stay in Kyoto, we opted for the hotel breakfast package during booking. This ended up being a great decision, as we got to try several different traditional Japanese morning dishes, along with a buffet of other items. I discovered that I am a HUGE oden fan—oden rocks, and it was such a highlight of my Kyoto mornings.

After breakfast, we requested a ride through Uber to Philosopher's Path. I was on the fence about the path, as it was still winter/early spring and there was no foliage. However, the moment we got off, we got distracted by a small shopping street leading up to Higashiyama Jisho-ji. We got a matcha cream puff at Ginkakuji Matsubaya, and it was 10/10. When we reached the entrance of Higashiyama, I decided we should check this place out, and I’m glad I did instead of walking the path. The garden was stunning, and it was so much fun walking around. We easily spent 40 minutes taking it all in.

Once we finished, we saw a stand for sugar covered strawberries and dango to try. Ended up liking the taste of the dango with the brown syrup on top. It was much savorier than I expected.

As we didn't plan to walk the whole Philosopher's Path, we decided to make a trek to Mo-an Café. It was quite the hike up the hill, but extremely fun looking at all the Kyoto houses and smaller shrines. Once we got to Mo-an, I was taken aback by the atmosphere. It's a great hidden place, but know that it's extremely quiet and tranquil — so much so so that it was jarring when a group of other travelers waiting outside was speaking so loudly you could hear it inside. Once we finished, we headed back down towards Yoshida Shrine, another large, gorgeous shrine with a priest doing his prayers.We hailed a taxi and made our way towards the iconic Sannenzaka spot.  
  
**Pro Tip:** Download the “Go” app prior to your trip for taxis. But if you mess up like me and notice the app requires a text confirmation, use your parents' or a friend's phone number and have them them provide you the message, since your eSIM won't have a phone number.

We had our taxi drop us off at Kodaiji Park, which is a great tip since it’s super close to the iconic area but easy for the taxi to pull up with its parking lot. I was nervous about this spot because online it's painted as an 'overtourism' hellscape. What I found instead was a busy shopping street filled with fun shops, including a small Ghibli store I didn't even know was there! However, I found the Ghilbi store at Diver City to have a larger variety of items, whereas the Kyoto one has a smaller offering. We went into the iconic Starbucks, rested for a few minutes, and then went back out for more sightseeing, heading towards Kiyomizu-dera. I think my experience with larger crowds made me think it was not much different from visiting Disney World during peak seasons.  
  
Once we got to Kiyomizu-dera, I was taken aback by its beauty. This was 100% the busiest temple we went to during the whole trip, but everyone was nice enough to continue moving along, so it was easy to look over the ledge and take pictures. I noticed when we got to the three streams of Otowa, a lot of people didn't know what they were looking at or doing. Ironically, I had played ""Go! Go! The Nippon! My first trip to Japan” and a school field trip confirmed that one each of the waterfalls represented school achievement, fulfillment in love, and longevity. We both went with longevity. It was fun seeing all the kids do the school achievement one.  
  
Finishing up at Kiyomizu-dera and Sannenzaka, I honestly wished I’d spent more time in the area. You could easily spend a full day shopping and exploring this area but having just a few hours was still a lot of fun.  
  
We took another taxi to our final site for the day: Fushimi Inari Shrine. We had a dinner reservation at a restaurant right next to it, at Itsukichaya Fushimiinari. Exploring the shrine during 'blue hour' was a blast. We walked in for a few moments to thin out the crowds and took a bunch of pictures. It was such a gorgeous place to see during sunset, as the lanterns gave it an awesome vibe. I would 100% come back to Fushimi Inari during my next trip.  
  
Once we finished, it was time for our reservation, and we enjoyed a large 5-bowl, yummy beef shabu set. It was upstairs overlooking the forest, which was an awesome way to finish the day.  
  
Instead of taxiing back, we decided to take the near by metro down to the Nintendo Store to catch the last hour it was open. Then we learned that Japan has taxi stops-Basically, a bunch of taxis line up, and you just grab the first one. It's an easy way to get home quickly afterwards.  
  
**Day 4, Friday: Himeji -**

This day marked our first 'Day Trip' using our pass. Originally, we had planned to go to Osaka, but since this won’t be our only trip to Japan, I decided to make the most of the pass we got because of Hiroshima. One challenge, though, was needing to get to Shin-Osaka each day. This became tricky the first time, as we couldn't find the limited express for the life of us. Even though we were at the platform, we ended up missing it twice because Google Maps gave us serious doubts. We should have stuck to what I had on my Excel sheet. I’d advise using NaviTime over Google for station trips, as Google can sometimes suggest completely different routes. Still, we made it to Shin-Osaka in plenty of time for our short Shinkansen to Himeji. *(Ideally however this pass should be used if you are staying in Osaka vs Kyoto as it doesn't cover the Shinkasen route from Kyoto -> Osaka - I knew this but already had my hotel booked so we just dealt with it. However I do not recommend taking far daytrips from Kyoto, just not worth spending the extra hour.)*

We booked a free tour through i-guide [https://i-guide.jpn.org/](https://i-guide.jpn.org/), which pairs you with a Japanese local learning English. I wouldn’t recommend this if you’re introverted or if you expect the best guide experience. It's very casual, and I ended up helping to help our tour guide learn some new English words to describe things. The tour was quite long—we spent pretty much the entire day with our guide. You’re supposed to buy their lunch, but he insisted on paying for ours instead! I had packed an omiyage (small gift) to give at the end so I got the favor back haha. He took us to a small local okonomiyaki spot, and it was 20 times better than what we had in Ueno.  
  
After eating, we visited the garden by Himeji Castle, which was pretty, but since it was still winter/early spring, there was not much foliage. We got along so well with our tour guide that he offered to give us a tour of Kobe next time we come, and to spend more time with us.  
  
Afterwards, we explored Himeji's small shopping area before heading back to our accommodation to rest up for our next day trip.

**Day 5, Saturday: Hiroshima -**

This day was the most straightforward and mainly spent traveling. The only goal for the day was to visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, as my partner had always wanted to go. We really enjoyed the experience, but I would recommend staying the night if possible. We didn’t mind losing most of the day (it was nice to reset our feet), but a better plan would have been to spend the following day exploring Hiroshima(Which didn't fit into our schedule).

We had breakfast at New York New York in Hiroshima, a cute little café, before heading to the memorial. We spent a couple of hours there, taking it slow and reading everything. While we loved the Memorial, we were disappointed by how tiny and cramped it was. The layout was not great, and with the number of people, it took forever to see anything. Additionally, there were some tourists behaving in poor taste, taking selfies and giving thumbs up—extremely disrespectful.

Originally had planned to take a taxi to the memorial and back but found taking the surface tram worked out great.

**Day 6, Sunday: Kyoto ( Arashiyama, kinkaku-ji, Nishiki Market) -**

This day had a few changes from what I had originally planned due to the weather, as it was rainy. We ended up spending more time walking around Arashiyama and skipped the Monkey Park since we didn't want to trek up a potentially muddy path. We also shipped out our checked bags to our next hotel with the help of the hotel's front desk.

Our taxi driver dropped us off at a side/end section of the Arashi Bambooyama Forest, which left us a bit confused as there wasn’t anyone around. It could have been the weather keeping people away, but the crowd level was very manageable. I wasn’t that impressed with the forest—it could have been the weather though.

Once we finished taking a few pictures, we explored Arashiyama itself, which was gorgeous. We stopped by a few shops and picked up some yummy treats. After spending a few hours in the area, we took a taxi to Kinkaku-ji.

We probably got extremely lucky with the bad weather, as Kinkaku-ji was also less crowed. The weather started clearing up, so we got some awesome pictures. This temple was a really fun place to explore and walk around. It took less than an hour to really take it all in. Right before the exit, we saw they were offering a tea experience for only 500 yen. We decided to give it a try, and it was such a cheap and fun experience with matcha and a gold-flake treat. I will 100% recommend it.

Next, we took another taxi to Nishiki Market, where we tried a few things on my list. I felt that there were a lot of overpriced items at the market compared to other stalls I had seen throughout the day. The most memorable were Kyo no Onikudokoro and まるもち家 錦小路店. Highly recommend both—they were well-priced and offered a great experience.

We spent the rest of the day shopping and eating around Nishiki Market. While it was busy, it wasn't much different the crowd levels of Pike Place Market. I was shocked by the sheer number of retail stores in Nishiki. I wish we had more time to step into each one!  
  
**Day 7, Monday: Uji (Nintendo Museum) –**

Check-out day and the last day of our Kyoto hotel breakfast. I didn't realize just how much I was going to miss having breakfast at the hotel. It was a great way to get all the energy I needed to start the day. I'll probably consider doing more Japanese breakfast add-ons in the future. We shipped our carry-on bags to the Mitsui Garden hotel next to the station so we could pick them up when we returned from Uji.

The primary focus of the day was the Nintendo Museum and exploring Uji, time permitting. We ended up getting to Uji earlier than expected—about an hour before anything opened—so we had time to check out Byodoin Temple. It was a fun little stroll, and the museum inside the area was cool. Afterward, we had matcha dessert and drinks at Nakamura Tokichi Byodo-in, which was soooo good.

With 30 minutes to spare, we headed over to the Nintendo Museum, just one stop and a short walk from Uji. We had an absolute blast at the museum. We did the shopping first because we were worried things would sell out (which, in hindsight, was kind of silly, as nothing sold out). We spent $250 on shirts and a large Wii controller plush (the packable duffle fit the Wii controller without any issues). They recommend doing the interactive games first, and I totally agree. We did the museum first, and when we got to the interactive games, there were no lines. However, by the time we finished, the game section was packed, and huge lines had formed. We spent our coins on the batting cages a couple of times, then played the Wii controller mini-games and Mario Kart on the N64. I 100% recommend the batting cages—so much fun!

We also signed up for the Hanafuda cards lesson, which was AWESOME! We were the only foreigners, but the staff was super kind in helping us get started. I loved Hanafuda so much that I ended up picking up a deck later in the trip.

Afterward, we headed back to Kyoto Station with some time to spare to pick up bentos and our checked bags. The ride to Tokyo Station went smoothly, even though it was another packed Shinkansen. From there, we rode another line at Tokyo Station to Shinjuku. Super easy, just following the station signs and the platform listed on Google to our next Hotel.

***Kyoto Hotel Review – Mitsui Garden*** ***Shinmachi Bettei : 9/10***  
Originally, we had planned to stay at another Mitsui Garden Hotel, nicknamed the ""temple hotel"" next to Nishiki Market. However, due to construction, they rebooked us at this sister hotel. While the location wasn't the best, everything else was amazing. Great customer service, an amazing room, a wonderful breakfast, and a great onsen with plenty of shower stalls and grooming amenities. I was super impressed with the Mitsui Garden chain and will be staying at their sister hotels in the future.

**Day 8, Tuesday: Harajuku, Shibuya ( Shibuya Sky ), Shinjuku -**

The day started with an onsen in the morning, and I was really glad I stuck with morning onsens at this hotel. My girlfriend, who did the Onsen at night, had some wild experiences. I even made a Reddit post about how hotel guests completely ignored onsen etiquette. The hotel didn’t have much explanation compared to my previous stays, so I wasn’t surprised people didn’t know the rules.

After coming from our spacious Kyoto hotel room, this double twin room felt even smaller than the one in Asakusa and was incredibly dusty. Honestly, I kind of hated this hotel from the get-go, which soured my Tokyo experience.

We started the day with breakfast in Harajuku at Honolulu Coffee. It was good, but crazy expensive for what we got compared to Kyoto, and I later realized that food in Kyoto was much cheaper than in Tokyo—at least that’s how it felt to me.

We then strolled down to Meiji Jingu and enjoyed the peaceful scenery, killing time until most stores opened at 11 AM. Once they did, we walked down the iconic street, stopping by a few pre-planned shops.

Getting to Shibuya was quick and easy, and the station opened right onto the iconic crossing, where we had a laugh at how underwhelming it was. We had a reservation at Shibuya Sky later in the day at 3:30, so we killed time going to Parco Mall for the many different shops. We had a great time walking around Shibuya and think it was an excellent shopping/food experience. Looking back, I’d spend more time in Shibuya than Shinjuku or Ginza.

I was on the fence about staying for the sunset at Shibuya Sky because the weather was cloudy. We decided to wait for the sunset, but I’m not 100% sure it was worth it. The weather was cold and overcast, and we spent most of the time indoors. I also found the Tokyo skyline to be too homogeneous, and paired with the grey sky, it didn't feel as memorable as other observatories I've visited in New York City. The sunset was pretty, but nothing to write home about. The real magic, in my opinion, came around the ""Blue Hour""—the few minutes after the sun goes past the horizon when the lights start to turn on. The city really came alive, and my initial criticism of the skyline completely faded. The Tokyo Tower looked absolutely stunning against the night sky from Shibuya Sky. Depending on the weather forecast, I’d recommend coming slightly after sunset to catch that blue hour/nighttime view of the city.

Afterward, we did a bit more shopping and headed back to the hotel to drop everything off before checking out Shinjuku and Golden Gai.

Once we got to Golden Gai, we were extremely underwhelmed and ended up laughing at how touristy it all felt, with multiple tour guides shuffling people around ,but it was silent. Despite being busy, no one was talking. We only cared about two bars: Anime Bar and Open Book. We ended up getting a spot at the Open Book bar, which was pretty, but the drinks were overpriced. It also had a kind of ‘cold’ vibe—the bottom floor was for tourists, while the top floor was for locals, as the bartender would send anyone who spoke Japanese upstairs. When we got in, for a packed bar, it was surprisingly silent. Eventually, we struck up a conversation with a couple next to us. There was a small cover charge, and the lemon sour was just okay. However, the Cola Sour was absolutely delicious! We finished quickly, tried at the Anime Bar, but it was still packed and made our way to Kabukicho/Godzilla instead.

Kabukicho was interesting and definitely lived up to its infamous reputation. I felt fine and ignored the street promoters trying to get us to shake hands or strike up conversations. My girlfriend didn’t feel the same though. We had originally considered booking our hotel here, and she said she was glad we didn’t since she felt like she would have been unable to step outside alone due to possibly being harassed and followed. She said she didn’t feel that way in any other location we stayed at. I was also shocked to see so many tourists going up to the street promoters and following them into the clubs. One group even asked, ""Where can we have fun?"" I was shocked that they didn’t realize most of these guys are scammers.

We got our pictures with Godzilla and walked into the movie theater, which completely blew us away. Why are Japanese movie theaters so cool! They had a little gift shop where we found exclusive made in Japan Wicked merch. The food also looked good and cheap! We seriously considered watching a movie, but didn’t have the time.

Slightly disappointed with Shinjuku, we walked past a gacha claw game place in Kabukicho, where I found out I had a little gambling addiction. Later, I learned that the UFO claw game at this location was reasonably priced at 100 yen per try, compared to 200 yen in Akihabara. 

**Day 9, Wednesday: Tsukiji Outer Market, Diver City (Teamlabs Planet)(Freak snow day) –**

This day started off weirdly—with a freak hailstorm that turned into snow. The weather report said it was only going to rain, but in Shinjuku, we got a solid inch of snow. **Pro Tip:** All our hotels offered free umbrellas to borrow, so no need to buy one.

I wouldn't visit Tsukiji Market on a Wednesday again as many places are closed. Despite the snow, walking through the stalls was still fun. We ended up at a coffee shop that was random but hilarious—turns out, it was John Lennon's favorite place? They had a newspaper claiming it was. We also found a ramen spot that was a Godsend For the extremely cold weather, and I highly recommend it.

Given the windy, snowy, and rainy weather, we decided to head to Diver City a little earlier than planned. It worked out great as a collection of indoor malls. We spent some time in all the shops, and the Gundam shop was really fun. We even picked up some exclusive items from there.

We had dinner at Gonpachi Odaiba after trying some takoyaki at the Takakoyaki food court. Then we headed to TeamLab Planets.

I chose TeamLab Planet over Borderless because I wanted the linear experience. I’ve known about TeamLab since 2016 when I first saw it through Jakenbakelive on Twitch, and I was really excited to experience it for myself. I'm happy to say it surpassed my expectations. The water section was soooooooo fun — we spent most of our time there and had to drag ourselves away to explore the other parts. Highly recommend it – 10/10. The room where you sit and watch the dome projection of flowers/plants moving around is extremely trippy. My girlfriend is prone to motion sickness and mentioned this was the only room that made her quite dizzy once she sat up.

We left around closing time, probably spending more than three hours there. Now, on my Excel schedule, I had planned to take the metro, but Google Maps said a bus would be ""faster."" Normally, I avoid buses because they're an unreliable gamble. However, we decided to risk it, which turned out to be a mistake. When we got to the bus stop, there was a line of people waiting—and worst of all, the bus didn't stop at the stop because it was already packed.

**Pro Tip:** If you have the option of taking the metro vs. a bus, choose the metro, even if it's 5 minutes slower. It's not worth the risk. We had to backtrack for 10 minutes and ride the metro.

**Day 10, Thursday: Ginza, Akihabara**

This day was laser-focused on two main goals: find a Rukia from Bleach Relax Time series figure in Akihabara and get a pair of made-in-Japan loafers from the Haruta brand in Ginza. We also had our omakase reservation, which I made through Tablelog (the Japanese version, since the English version didn't allow for reservations).

Our day started early in Jinbocho, where I had found a cute coffee shop online prior. However, when we got there, we learned it was closed due to the public holiday—along with our backup option. So, we ended up at Trully's Coffee. Afterward, we walked around the Imperial Gardens while waiting for our omakese reservation at noon. The gardens were gorgeous, and I’d love to return when everything is blooming. It's huge, so don't underestimate the time it takes to cross the garden.

All the walking and the light breakfast set us up perfectly for our lunch at Ginza Sushi Banya. I managed to snag a lunch reservation for a crazy good price of about $60 per person. This spot is clearly popular with locals, as the reservation required a Japanese Tabelog account, making us the only tourists. They were extremely welcoming, though. The sushi experience completely spoiled us—I’d love to do this again.

After lunch, we did some more shopping. Eventually setting off to find the Haruta loafers, made our way to a random ABC-mart in a mall. Little did we know, the mall had a physical Haruta section! It was a complete surprise and a great find. The workers helped us try on what we wanted, and we walked out with a pair each. They were a great price for well-made loafers. We spent some more time walking around Ginza before heading toward Akihabara.

At Akihabara, I wasn’t expecting to enjoy it much, as everyone online talks about it in a mixed way. However, I ended up having an absolute blast—so much so that we decided to stay longer than originally planned. We grabbed some food at Cow Cow Kitchen, which I highly recommend cheap and yummy.

We set out to find my Bleach figure, hitting up multiple figure stores. It was a lot of fun, but prices were all over the place, so don’t commit to anything on first sight—shop around! One store may have an item for three times the price of the store next door, where it could be under 1000 yen. We were having no luck with Bleach figures until our last store, where we struck gold. We found so many Bleach figures, and by sheer luck, I got my Relax Time Rukia! We almost screamed when my girlfriend pulled it out. **Pro Tip:** Do some figure research beforehand and it becomes like a mini treasure hunt.

We didn’t do any UFO crane games, as the 200 yen per play it didn’t seem worth it compared to what we found in Shinjuku, but we still walked around finding cool gachapons we wanted.

I really wish I'd spent more time in Akihabara. Even if you're not there for shopping, just browsing is a lot of fun.

***Shinjuku Hotel Review: Onsen Ryokan Yuen 4/10***  
The hotel was pretty, but it was ruined by several things. Poor cleaning (the room was extremely dusty). Lack of AC control (Kyoto and Asakusa both allowed us to control it), and the room was incredibly stuffy—so much so that we ended up sleeping naked because it was so hot. The AC was centrally controlled, but it was basically off. Also, one set of elevators was constantly being used, which meant crazy waits just to get to the lobby. The onsen experience was disappointing for my girlfriend, which soured the overall experience. We won't stay here again.

**Day 11, Friday: Shinjuku –**

The last day arrived, and the trip felt both long and short at the same time. For my final morning onsen, I got to see a gorgeous sunrise, which was the perfect way to end it. We had pre-booked an airport ‘limousine,’ essentially a bus, to take us to the airport, so we didn’t need to worry about our two checked bags. Our flight wasn't until 9 PM, so we still had time to explore. We taxied to Keio Plaza Hotel, where the limousine was scheduled to pick us up. The hotel has a deal with the airport limousine service, so they will hold up to two bags per person, which worked out perfectly for us.

After dropping off our bags, we headed to Musashino Mori Diner for breakfast to finally try fluffy pancakes. We loved it! We got their pancake sets, which included a rice dish and pancakes for 'dessert.' The pancakes reminded me of eating whipped cream — they were so light and fluffy.

The rest of the day was spent exploring Shinjuku, doing a final Donki run, checking out Beams, and just soaking in the sights before heading back to Keio Plaza to catch our limousine to the airport.",1,1743099418.0,JapanTravel,0,1.0,False

*“Hi \[Name\], I create 60-second promo videos that boost engagement. Can I make one for your bakery for FREE? If you like it, we can work together!”*



**Step 2: Create the Video**

* Film clips of their products (e.g., cakes, coffee).
* Upload to AI Movie Maker, pick a **“Food & Beverage” template**, add upbeat music, and let the AI sync transitions.

**Step 3: Deliver & Charge**

I charged **$150/video** and delivered 4 videos/month. The bakery loved the results and even referred me to other clients!

**Pro Tip**: Offer a discount for bulk orders (e.g., 3 videos for $400).



# Method 3: Create & Sell Stock Videos

Websites like **Shutterstock** pay for stock footage. Here’s how I made $1,200 in 2 months:

**Step 1: Film Generic Clips**Record short clips of nature, city life, or people working. Use your phone—no fancy camera needed!

**Step 2: Enhance with AI Movie Maker**

* Upload your clips.
* Use the **“Enhance Quality”** tool to fix lighting or stabilize shaky footage.
* Add tags like “sunset beach” or “busy office” for SEO.

**Step 3: Upload to Stock Sites**Shutterstock pays 

0.25−

0.25−**4.50 per download**. I uploaded 50 clips and earned passive income!

**Pro Tip**: Film “timeless” content (e.g., landscapes) that never goes out of style.



# Bonus Tips to Succeed

This is so surprising to me because I don't even enjoy waffles. But basically, in my dream, I had gotten up for breakfast and wanted to make something to eat. I can't remember much of what happened in between, but next thing I know is that I prepared pancake batter, but after cooking them, I got surprised to see that the outcome were waffles, with the perfect shape and everything.

Even in my dream I was surprised that waffles had come out. When I got up, I was in the mood for something sweet to go with my coffee, so I got donuts and a Berliner. Two hours later it came to me that I had had this dream.

1jlak1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1jlak1h/is_this_normal/,Is this normal?,"My husband and I have been married 2 years, together 10. I’ve always known he was blunt, sharp, and to the point…some would say rude. When he is irritated it’s worse. He has never put his hands on me however he’s starting to tread the line… when he gets in these “moods” he can be real nice-nasty. He comes from a family that regularly curses and yells at each other then goes to back to normal the next minute. I was raised in a different household. Only my dad yelled and cursed; we knew this meant to stay out of his way. I definitely have trauma from having to walk on eggshells. Therefore, hearing any type of language as such triggers me. 

So, I accidentally left an empty box of crackers in the cabinet. I did eat the last of the crackers however I distinctly remember asking him to bring me a sleeve of crackers a few nights ago. Therefore I didn’t physically take the last sleeve myself, I asked him to get it for me so I didn’t know the box was empty (hopefully that makes sense…basically I never saw the box empty myself). This morning he went to grab some and realized the box was empty and threw it at me. I felt this was excessive but I didn’t say anything. 

The other day we were in the drive thru coffee line and he realized his order was wrong. I told him he should take it back because you should get what you paid for. He responds “put the fucking car in drive and let’s go”. I almost cried.

These may seem like little things but I’m terrified that he’s going to turn into my dad, which whom I was so afraid of when he would get in moods like this. Is this normal, should I be looking for potential signs? He’s not always like this, probably only about 25% of our marriage however I don’t want that percentage to increase later in life.
