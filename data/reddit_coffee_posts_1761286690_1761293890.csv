I have a friend, who I shall refer to as 'X' to peserve anonymity. She's someone I used to work with, several years ago - I fell out of contact with her for 4 years, after I left that job. We reconnected last year and got pretty close again. Then, I had to go and develop feelings for her! 😓 

She'd begun to clock this and had made it clear that she just wanted to be friends. I've been working to control my feelings and accept what she wants. It's not been easy, but I've never tried anything outrageous- never tried to kiss her, never actually asked her on a date. The most intimate thing we'd ever done was hug at the end of every meet up. 

Two weeks ago, I met her for coffee. Her birthday was a few days before, and I got her a friendship bracelet and a hatbox of flowers (FunkyPigeon offers flowers as a gift to go along side a card - I knew she had an interest in these, and gardening. I thought it would be a nice gesture). However, she gently described the flowers  as “putting a toe over the boundary.” At that point, we openly talked about me having feelings; better to get it out there rather than bottling it all up. She explained she’d have preferred receiving either the bracelet or the flowers, not both — not out of rejection, but to maintain balance and boundaries. She reaffirmed her desire for a platonic friendship. I handled the talk maturely and wrote her a heartfelt follow-up letter acknowledging her boundaries, thanking her for her kindness, and promising to honour those boundaries moving forward. I did admit that the feelings would likely still bubble under the surface, but that's to be expected, isn't it? Feelings don't just evaporate at the click of the fingers. 

We left that meeting in good terms - heck, we had another hug, for pity's sake! I asked her in a DM if we were still good. X responded warmly, saying: “As long as you are ok, then we are good.”

For three days, I felt deep embarrassment and self-blame, believing I might have “spoiled” the friendship. I posted a Facebook status indirectly referring to the situation, expressing remorse but assuring others who had noticed I was emotionally compromised, that I’d be okay. It was my way of venting.

During the next two days, I started examining my feelings more deeply and realised my panic wasn’t about rejection — it was about potentially losing her friendship again. I developed coping mantras like: “I am not in love with X. I am proud to just be friends!” While I may never fully erase my feelings, I could reframe them. I committed to waiting at least seven days before reinitiating contact — giving both of us emotional breathing space.

Come Day 8, I decided, “It’s time to reach out to X.” I sent a friendly, neutral message:
“Hey 👋, just thought I’d say hi — hope your week’s been going well.”

Unread - still, to this day.

I tried a follow up, 4 days later,  acknowledging that she's likely busy, but reaffirming that I accepted everything we talked about and that I was OK. I said that I'd be here to talk when she's ready.

This has gone unread, also.

I've observed that X has been actively online on Messenger, reading my stories. But it feels like she is deliberately avoiding me, otherwise. Catastrophising thoughts have been overwhelming me, even though leaving a message unread for several days is consistent with historic behaviour - X has a track record of slow replies. This length of time, though, is a new record. 

She had previously said, when another close friend moved across the country, “Don’t worry, I won’t disappear on you.” She's previously called me a, ""Dear Friend."" She's said that I can always talk to her.
It's all just feeling a bit hypocritical right now 🤷‍♂️

A lot of negative thoughts are going through my mind. Feelings that I've ruined everything. That she's finding it too awkward to talk to me. That she's too infatuated with another boy to bother to read anything I send. That's fine, btw - the trauma of all this has helped me bury the lingering feelings deep down. Besides, if she is with someone else, I'm not one to stand in the way of that.

If she needed space, I'd have preferred she communicated that; not leave me with complete and total silence, in contrast to her last assurance that we were good! I'd have respect her request.

I don't want a repeat of the 4 years of silence... I just want to fix this! I just want my friend back!!!! 😭

1oerwc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealingWithMoxibustio/comments/1oerwc8/my_panic_attacks_disappeared_after_30_days_of/,My Panic Attacks Disappeared After 30 Days of Moxa – Here’s Why,"One late autumn evening last year, I was waiting in line at the grocery store checkout when a heavy, stone-like pressure suddenly settled on my chest. I was gasping for air, forced to breathe through my mouth, and the buzz of the store sounded like a shrill whistle. My fingers tingled so badly I could barely hold onto my shopping bag. It was my 17th panic attack, just 3 days after the last one. As a 42-year-old advertising executive in New York, years of overtime and proposal deadlines had left me dependent on anti-anxiety meds to sleep—but the side effects, like dizziness and memory lapses, made me too embarrassed to even attend my daughter’s parent-teacher conferences.

Then I met Dr. Li, a TCM practitioner. He looked at the crumpled prescription in my hand and said, “Your problem isn’t a ‘broken brain’—it’s unbalanced qi and blood.” He suggested I try moxibustion and recommended a portable moxibustion device from the brand RUNNING MARS, explaining it was easy to use and perfect for busy professionals like me who didn’t have time for clinic visits. I decided to give it a shot, figuring “nothing else was working,” and started a 30-day moxibustion routine. I never imagined it would be the start of leaving panic attacks behind for good.

# The Truth About Panic Attacks: It’s Not Just “All in Your Head”

For years, I thought my panic attacks were a sign of “weak willpower”—until a heart rate variability (HRV) test revealed my sympathetic nervous system was 60% more active than average, like an engine that never turned off. Dr. Li explained that in TCM terms, this was “heart-kidney disharmony and liver qi stagnation”: chronic stress had sent my heart qi floating upward while my kidney qi sank downward, throwing my body’s yin and yang out of balance and triggering emotional chaos. From a modern medical perspective, panic attacks stem from “autonomic nervous system dysfunction”—and moxibustion addresses this root cause directly.

Data from the Anxiety and Depression Association of America shows roughly 6 million Americans live with panic disorder, and 40% abandon treatment due to medication side effects. A 2023 study in the *Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine* confirmed moxibustion reduces panic attack frequency by 58% with no side effects, thanks to three key mechanisms:

1. It regulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, lowering cortisol levels by 28% to ease stress responses.
2. It boosts gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels—this “calming neurotransmitter” directly suppresses anxiety signals in the brain.
3. It improves vagal nerve activity, increasing HRV by 35% to enhance emotional stability.

Simply put, moxibustion doesn’t “erase anxiety”—it helps your body rebuild an “emotional brake system.” It’s a change I never felt after two years of medication.

# My 30-Day Moxibustion Journal: From “Daily Attacks” to “21 Days Attack-Free”

# Days 1–7: Stopping the “Emotional Rollercoaster”

At first, my hands shook so much I could barely light the moxa stick. Dr. Li advised I start with “calming acupoints,” using that portable moxibustion device on Neiguan (PC6)—it clips onto your wrist, so I could even use it discreetly during meetings without disrupting work.

**Daily Routine**:

* Neiguan (PC6) (2 cun above the wrist crease): 10 minutes morning and night to ease palpitations and chest tightness.
* Shenmen (HT7) (ulnar depression at the wrist crease) before bed: 10 minutes to relax the nervous system and improve sleep.

On day 3, I worked until 11 PM—usually, this would trigger chest tightness, but that night I only felt mild restlessness. After 5 minutes of moxibustion on Neiguan, the discomfort vanished. By day 7, my panic attacks dropped from “once every 3 days” to “once a week,” and their duration shrank from 20 minutes to 5. For the first time in months, I could sit through an entire meeting without feeling like I was suffocating.

# Days 8–21: Rebuilding the “Emotional Stabilizer”

On day 8, Dr. Li suggested adding Taichong (LR3) to my routine, explaining it “soothes liver qi” and targets the “source of my anxiety.” I switched to thin moxa sticks for gentle warming—they produce little smoke and a mild scent, so my coworkers never noticed when I used it in the office.

**Daily Routine**:

* Neiguan (PC6) + Shenmen (HT7) (same as before).
* Taichong (LR3) (between the first and second metatarsals on the foot): 15 minutes each night to release stress.

Day 15 was a turning point: During a client presentation, they suddenly demanded we scrap our entire plan. Normally, my heart would race out of control—but that day, I calmly said, “We’ll have a new proposal for you in 30 minutes.” When I got home, I realized I’d gone 10 days without a panic attack. My daughter even commented, “Mom doesn’t snap at me anymore.” By day 21, my HRV test showed my sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems were finally balanced—and my doctor suggested I start reducing my medication dose.

# Days 22–30: Reclaiming My “Out-of-Control Life”

For the final 9 days, I added Baihui (GV20) to my routine. Dr. Li said it “raises clear qi and lowers turbid qi” to keep emotions steady. I kept the portable moxibustion device in my office drawer; when stress spiked, I’d use it for 10 minutes—like a quick “energy boost” for my body.

On day 30, the subway broke down mid-ride, and the car erupted into chaos. In the past, I would have started hyperventilating immediately—but that day, I took a deep breath, pulled out the moxibustion device from my bag, and used it on Neiguan for 5 minutes. I stayed calm the entire time. That night, I fell asleep in 10 minutes without medication for the first time—and dreamed of taking my daughter to Disney World.

Three months later, I haven’t had a single panic attack. I’ve stopped taking anti-anxiety meds entirely, and I’ve even picked up running and painting again—hobbies I’d abandoned when anxiety took over my life.

# Why Does Moxibustion Work for Panic Attacks? 3 Scientific Reasons

# 1. It Regulates the Autonomic Nervous System: Hitting the “Brake” on Overactive Nerves

During a panic attack, the sympathetic nervous system revs like a runaway car. Moxibustion’s warm stimulation activates the vagus nerve—the “brake” for your autonomic nervous system. Studies show 10 minutes of moxibustion on Neiguan increases vagal nerve activity by 40%, quickly easing palpitations and shortness of breath. Whenever I feel chest tightness now, 5 minutes on Neiguan helps my breathing steady, and the tingling in my fingers fades away.

# 2. It Improves Brain Chemistry: Refilling the “Emotional Reservoir”

Chronic anxiety depletes GABA—the brain’s “calming neurotransmitter”—like a reservoir running dry. Moxibustion boosts GABA production while lowering levels of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter linked to anxiety. A blood test on day 21 showed my GABA levels were 32% higher than before treatment—key to staying calm when the client derailed our presentation.

# 3. It Relieves Physical Tension: Breaking the “Anxiety-Muscle Tightness” Cycle

During panic attacks, our bodies tense up unconsciously—shoulders hunch, fists clench—and this physical tension worsens anxiety, creating a vicious cycle. Moxibustion relaxes tight muscles, especially in the shoulders, neck, and chest. I now use moxibustion on Jianjing (GB21) for 10 minutes every morning; it feels like lifting a weight off my shoulders, leaving me light and relaxed.

# Moxibustion Guide for Panic Attack Sufferers: Tools & Acupoints

# Essential Tools (Perfect for Busy Professionals)

* **Portable Moxibustion Device**: Compact and clip-on, it fits in pockets or bags for on-the-go use—I relied on it in offices and subways.
* **Thin Moxa Sticks**: Low smoke and mild scent, ideal for sensitive areas like the face and wrists, and discreet enough for workplaces.
* **Moxibustion Box**: Best for home use, it’s great for larger areas like the abdomen or legs.

# Key Acupoints (Ranked by Priority)

* **Neiguan (PC6)** (Emergency Relief): 2 cun above the wrist crease, between the two tendons when palms face upward. Use for 5–10 minutes during panic attacks to ease palpitations and chest tightness.

* **Shenmen (HT7)** (Sleep Improvement): Ulnar depression at the wrist crease, near the pinky. 10 minutes before bed to improve sleep and reduce nighttime panic attacks.

* **Taichong (LR3)** (Long-Term Regulation): Between the first and second metatarsals on the foot, press upward until you feel a tender spot. 15 minutes daily to release stress at its source.

* **Baihui (GV20)** (Emotional Balance): Top center of the head, at the midpoint of a line connecting the ears. 10 minutes 3 times a week to enhance emotional stability.

# Usage Precautions

* Temperature: Keep it “warm but not burning” (most portable devices have 3 heat settings—I stuck to the medium one).
* Timing: Avoid moxibustion within 30 minutes of eating to prevent digestive discomfort.
* Hydration: Drink 7 oz (200ml) of warm water after moxibustion to support metabolism.
* Medication: Never stop meds suddenly—reduce dosage gradually under a doctor’s guidance.

# To Anyone Struggling with Panic Attacks: 3 Tips

1. **Don’t Label Yourself a “Patient”**: Panic attacks aren’t a sign you’re “crazy”—they’re your body’s “SOS signal,” like a fever telling you you’re sick. They’re a reminder to slow down.
2. **Find Your “Anxiety Triggers”**: I realized my panic attacks spiked around deadline pressure—now I finish work a week early to avoid that stress.
3. **Give Yourself 10 Minutes of “Moxibustion Time” Daily**: It doesn’t have to be complicated—even 5 minutes on Neiguan is a form of self-care. I now see moxibustion as part of my routine, like drinking a morning coffee.

Finally, to anyone who’s ever felt trapped by panic attacks: It’s not your fault, and it’s not a life sentence. Just as 30 days of moxibustion helped me reclaim my life, you too can find a way to embrace calm again.",1,1761293023.0,HealingWithMoxibustio,0,1.0,False

Got about 280k invested across four different accounts right now. When I started getting serious about this two years ago I built this massive spreadsheet to track everything, I'm talking tabs for each account, formulas calculating my savings rate, projections based on different return scenarios, the whole nine yards.

Spent hours every week updating it. Like I'd sit down Saturday morning with coffee and go through each brokerage statement line by line. Kind of became my weekend ritual. I felt productive even though deep down I knew it was taking way too much time.

Then about six months ago I had this moment where I stepped back and realized I was tracking all this data but not really learning anything useful from it. My spreadsheet told me my net worth went up or down but I couldn't actually see patterns or understand what was working and what wasn't.

The breaking point was when I tried to figure out if my returns were beating the market. Spent three hours trying to calculate it properly and still wasn't sure if I did the math right. That's when I knew something had to change.

I still use notion for my main planning stuff but I stopped trying to track everything manually. Found a few tools that handle the calculation part automatically so I can actually focus on the decisions instead of the data entry. Still check my progress but now it's like once a week for ten minutes instead of hours of spreadsheet work.

My advice for anyone starting the fire journey is don't fall in love with your tracking system. The goal is financial independence not becoming an excel expert. Track what matters and automate the rest.

Anyone else go through a phase where tracking became more important than actual progress?",1,1761292962.0,personalfinance,0,0.57,False

A lot are asking if the Upgrade is worth from APP2. After having them for a week, I\`d say 100% yes. At least if ANC is important to you which it is for me. Just sitting in my regular coffee shop doing some work and I am genuinely impressed how good the ANC is compared to my APP2.

Normally I would use my Bose QC Ultra Headphones which would get hot on my ears after around 30 Mins. Not so the APP3 of course but still giving me around 90% of the QC Ultras ANC. So definitely a big win for me.

As for the fit... I am using L size tips, same as with the APP2. With APP2 I have a slight ""click"" from time to time when moving my head or jaw. This has disappeared with the 3s. The 3s sit tighter but sometimes feel they are falling out (which they never do). Comfort is good, I feel them but not in a way thats annoying.

Ever get that feeling that you need to completely overhaul your life to see any real progress? The massive diet change, the 5 AM gym routine, the total digital detox... it's exhausting just thinking about it.

I've been there. But the biggest game-changer for me wasn't some huge, dramatic leap. It was realizing that real, lasting optimization comes from the opposite direction.

It's all about the **tiny tweaks**. The 1% changes that are so small they feel insignificant. But when you stack them day after day, they create a massive impact. It’s like compound interest for your well-being.

Here are a few examples of what I mean:

*   **The ""One Thing"" Rule:** Before you leave a room, put just *one* thing back where it belongs. A cup in the dishwasher, a book on the shelf, a jacket on its hook. It takes 10 seconds, but it prevents your space from slowly descending into chaos.
*   **Hydration Anchor:** Link drinking a glass of water to something you already do without fail. For me, it's right before my morning coffee. Before the caffeine, water. Simple, non-negotiable.
*   **The 5-Minute Mind Sweep:** Feeling overwhelmed? Set a timer for 5 minutes and just write down everything swirling in your head. Don't edit, don't judge. Just get it out. It's amazing how much lighter you feel when the clutter is on paper instead of in your brain.

Of course, sometimes the ""tweak"" we need isn't about our routine, but about our mindset or emotional state. It's tough to organize your desk when your mind feels cluttered, and no amount of hydration can fix a deep-seated feeling of being stuck. Working through that internal resistance is its own kind of optimization. If you're feeling blocked in that department and want a more structured way to navigate those feelings, I found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** to be incredibly helpful for creating a personal plan.

These things sound small because they *are* small. That’s what makes them so powerful. You can actually *do* them, even on your worst days.

So, I'm curious—what's one tiny tweak you've made that had a surprisingly huge impact on your life? Let's share some ideas.",1,1761292708.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1oersts,https://youtu.be/iR0oCqy1ZXw,4 Very Scary TRUE Midnight Cemetery Security Guard Horror Stories,"# ""The Grave Fixer"":

I took the night security job at the Kuisebmond Cemetery because it paid steady and didn’t ask much of me beyond showing up and staying alert. At thirty-nine, with a wife and two kids depending on me, that was enough. Work in Walvis Bay wasn’t exactly falling from the sky. The cemetery sat on the edge of town—a wide, wind-swept expanse of sand and stone, dotted with crooked headstones and clusters of acacia trees that whispered when the wind picked up. By midnight, it always felt like the whole world had stopped breathing.

That Friday began like any other. I clocked in just before seven, trading a few tired words with Jonas, my coworker, in the small office near the main gate. “Quiet night ahead,” he said, handing me the flashlight and the ring of keys. “Just the usual rounds. Call if anything comes up.”

He left around ten, leaving behind the smell of instant coffee and the soft hum of the old radio. When the gate clicked shut behind him, the silence seemed to stretch.

I started my first patrol at eleven. My boots crunched over gravel as I followed the familiar paths winding between rows of graves. The beam of my flashlight cut through the dark, catching glints of polished marble and names etched deep into stone. Most of the job was simple—check the fences, make sure no one had broken in, keep an eye out for vandals or worse. You’d be surprised how often people tried to dig up fresh graves for jewelry or keepsakes.

Around midnight, I reached the far edge of the cemetery, where the older graves lay half-forgotten under low, wind-bent trees. That’s when I heard it—a faint scrape, metal against dirt. I stopped walking. The sound came again, sharper this time, deliberate. My first thought was a stray dog, but this didn’t sound like digging for scraps. It sounded like work.

I swung my light in a slow arc. The beam fell on empty ground, weathered stones, a few weeds dancing in the wind. Nothing moved. Still, the scrape came again, closer.

“Jonas, you around?” I said into the radio, but only static answered. He’d long gone home.

I gripped the flashlight tighter and followed the sound to a small cluster of family plots. The noise stopped as I approached. I called out, “Hello? Cemetery’s closed. You need to come out.”

No response.

I stepped off the path, crunching through dry leaves until my light caught a movement—someone crouched low behind a large headstone. My pulse kicked up. I moved closer, beam steady. The figure rose slowly, like something reluctant to leave the earth.

It was a man—tall, gaunt, clothes smeared with dirt. His face was half-hidden under the shadow of a cap. In his hands, he held a shovel.

“What are you doing here?” I asked, trying to sound firm. “You can’t be here after dark. This is private property.”

He tilted his head, studying me with eyes that didn’t quite focus right. When he finally spoke, his voice was rough, like gravel in a dry throat. “Looking for what’s mine,” he said. “They buried it wrong. I need to fix it.”

A cold ripple crawled down my back. “Put the shovel down,” I said. “Walk away now, or I’m calling the police.”

He stepped forward instead. “No police,” he murmured. “Just a minute. I’ll be gone.” His fingers tightened around the handle.

I reached for my radio again. “I said back up.”

That’s when he lunged.

The shovel came swinging out of the dark. I turned, but the edge clipped my arm, sending pain screaming up to my shoulder. My flashlight fell, the beam rolling wildly across the graves.

“Stop!” I shouted, but he came again, silent and quick. The next blow glanced off my forearm, bone jarring, teeth rattling. I grabbed for the shovel’s handle, and we struggled in the dark, grunting, breathing hard. He smelled of earth and something sour, like decay.

“Give it up!” he snarled. “Stay out!”

I shoved him back, scrambled for the flashlight, but he swung again—flat end this time, hard across my ribs. I gasped, the air leaving my lungs. I swung a fist, caught him in the shoulder, but he hardly flinched. Then he tackled me, and we went down together, rolling through the dirt. His hands pinned mine, and the shovel rose high over my face.

“Jonas! Help!” I yelled into the radio, thumb finding the transmit button by instinct.

The man froze for a split second, head cocked as if listening. Then he brought the shovel down. The edge grazed my head—a white flash, then black.

When I woke, there were lights. Jonas knelt over me, voice trembling. “Hey, hey, stay with me. What the hell happened?”

My head throbbed. Blood ran into my eyes. The man was gone, the shovel lying a few feet away, half-buried in loose soil.

The police came fast, their flashlights slicing the night. They took statements, marked off the scene, said all the things cops say when they don’t have much to go on. “Unknown suspect,” one of them muttered. “You’re lucky to be alive.”

At the hospital, they patched me up—stitches on my scalp, cracked rib, bruised arm. I didn’t go back to the cemetery after that. Jonas covered my shifts until they found someone new.

But even now, some nights, when the wind blows against the windows, I swear I hear it again—that slow, scraping sound of metal on earth. And every time, I wonder what he was really digging for… and whether he ever found it.





# ""The Resurrection Men"":

I started my shift at the old city cemetery the same way I had every night for the past six months—unlocking the rusted gate at eleven, the hinges screeching into the empty streets. The office sat just inside the entrance, a squat brick building with one flickering bulb and a coffee pot that hadn’t worked right since summer. It wasn’t glamorous, but the pay was steady. After the mill closed and the layoffs hit half the town, I couldn’t be picky.

All I had to do was patrol every hour, watch for vandals or drunks, and lock up at dawn. Easy money, most nights. The quiet was almost comforting—just the wind through the trees, the hoot of an owl, the distant wail of a freight train crossing the river.

But that one night in late fall—everything changed.

Midnight came cold and still. I set out with my flashlight, its narrow beam cutting across the gravel paths between rows of leaning headstones. The cemetery spread for nearly twenty acres, fenced in by old wrought iron, though gaps had opened over the years. Kids sometimes snuck through, daring each other to spend a night among the dead.

The radio on my belt crackled softly, tied into police dispatch, though the signal was spotty in the back sections. I headed toward the oldest part of the grounds, where the stones were barely legible and the air always seemed heavier. That’s when I heard it—a faint scraping sound. Metal against dirt.

I stopped. Listened.

There it was again. Sharper this time. Coming from behind a row of weathered mausoleums.

“Who’s there?” My voice carried farther than I meant it to. Silence followed. Then, just beneath the wind, I heard something else—low murmurs. Two, maybe three voices. Whispering.

I tightened my grip on the flashlight. Vandals, I thought. Maybe a couple of drunks fooling around. Wouldn’t be the first time. I moved quietly down the path, crunching gravel under my boots. As I rounded a corner, my light caught the edge of a fresh grave—the one from that afternoon. Edward Hayes, sixty-three. The flowers were still bright against the turned soil.

That’s when I saw them.

Two men, crouched beside the mound. One digging, the other pulling something from the ground. They weren’t kids. Both wore dark coats and wide-brimmed hats, faces shadowed. One held a lantern low, its glow trembling across the dirt.

I ducked behind a tombstone, peering out. The stocky one with the shovel grunted as he heaved more earth aside.

“Hurry it up, Frank,” he muttered. “Doctor’s waiting, and he pays extra for ‘em fresh.”

The thinner man—Frank, apparently—glanced around nervously. “This place gives me the creeps, Joe. What if that guard comes by?”

Joe laughed under his breath, a dry, hollow sound. “That fool? Probably asleep in his shack. And if he ain’t—well, we’ll make sure he stays quiet. You got the rope?”

Frank nodded, hand brushing the coil at his side.

My mouth went dry. Grave robbers. Body snatchers. Resurrection men—like something out of the 1800s. I’d heard rumors before, cases in other towns where corpses were stolen for medical study. But here?

I eased back, reaching for the radio. Static hissed in my ear—no signal. The back corner always had dead spots. I shifted to get a better line—and stepped on a dry leaf.

The scraping stopped.

Joe’s head snapped up. “You hear that?”

Frank froze. “Yeah. Over there.”

I held still, breath locked in my chest.

Then Joe’s lantern swung toward me, light slashing across the stones. It found me instantly, blinding and cold.

“Hey!” Joe barked. “Who’s out there?”

I straightened, aiming my flashlight back. “Security. This is private property. You’re trespassing.”

Joe stared at me, then smiled—a slow, unfriendly grin. “Well, look here, Frank. The watchman himself.”

Frank rose, shovel in hand like a weapon. “What now?”

Joe bent to set the lantern down, revealing the grave’s gaping hole—and the cracked coffin beneath. A pale arm hung limply over the edge.

The sight made my stomach twist.

Joe stepped forward, fingers brushing the handle of a knife on his belt. “You should’ve stayed in your little office, friend.”

“I’m calling the police,” I said, thumb on the radio button. “Dispatch, come in—intruders at the Hayes plot, armed—”

Only static.

Joe moved fast, lunging toward me. I swung my flashlight and caught his wrist hard. He cursed, stumbling back.

“Frank! Grab him!”

Frank came at me, shovel raised. I turned and ran. The cemetery unfolded in darkness ahead—paths branching, stones jutting like teeth. My boots pounded the gravel, lungs burning, heart hammering in my ears. Behind me, Joe shouted, “You can’t hide forever!”

I cut toward the mausoleums, ducking between two tall crypts. The air was damp and smelled of moss and earth. I pressed myself against the stone, listening. Their footsteps slowed.

“Where’d he go?” Frank’s voice, closer now.

“Split up,” Joe hissed. “He’s around here somewhere. Find him—and don’t let him yell.”

Their voices drifted apart. I slipped out the other side, careful not to make a sound, and bolted for the office. Just one phone call, one real line out, and I’d be safe.

I rounded a corner—and Frank was there.

He swung the shovel like an axe. I ducked. The blade glanced off a headstone with a metallic shriek. I lunged low, tackling him. We hit the ground hard, rolling through the damp grass. He grabbed my collar, trying to choke me. “Joe! Over here!”

I kicked free, caught him in the jaw, scrambled up, and ran again. The radio on my belt hissed—just enough static to tell me the signal was returning. “Dispatch—this is cemetery security—two intruders—armed—”

Joe’s footsteps thundered behind me. “You’re dead, guard!”

I sprinted for the main path, the gate lights faint ahead. A passing car’s headlights flashed through the trees. I shouted, “Help! Police!”

Joe slammed into me from behind. We went down hard. His knife pressed cold against my back.

“Quiet,” he hissed. “You make another sound, I’ll gut you.”

Frank stumbled up, wiping blood from his mouth. “What now?”

“Kill him?”

Joe looked toward the road—sirens in the distance now. My call must’ve gone through. His face twisted. “No time. Tie him, dump him in the hole. By morning, he’s just another body.”

They dragged me toward the grave. The open coffin waited, the corpse’s eyes half-lidded, mouth slack.

“Please,” I gasped. “Don’t.”

Joe smirked. “You should’ve minded your business.”

Then the sirens grew louder—closer. Red and blue lights flickered against the trees. Joe cursed, grabbed Frank’s arm. “Run!”

They fled through the gap in the fence, vanishing into the dark.

The police reached me minutes later. They found the disturbed grave, the lantern, and the footprints—but Joe and Frank were gone. My story matched reports from other towns—body snatchers moving state to state, selling corpses to desperate medical schools. A week later, they were caught three counties over.

I quit the job soon after. Took a warehouse position on the day shift.

But sometimes, late at night, when the wind rattles my windows, I still hear that scraping sound in my head—metal on dirt—and remember how close I came to ending up in that hole beside Edward Hayes.





# ""Empty Coffin"":

I took the midnight job as the cemetery guard because it paid steady and the hours fit my life. Nights suited me—no boss breathing down my neck, just the slow loop of the paths and the steady thump of my own heart. The cemetery was old and wide, a place that kept its silence like a secret. Rows of headstones marched back a hundred years or more: some leaning like tired old men, their engravings moss-softened, others bright with recent flowers that didn't know how fragile they were. I walked with a lantern in one hand and a heavy stick in the other, the wood thudding against my palm for company. The boss said trouble was rare, but he warned about idiots and thieves—people who thought graves were treasure chests. I tried not to imagine them.

The shift began the way all of them did: I unlocked the main gate at eleven, checked the locks, and settled into my slow circuit. At midnight the air had a hard edge, the kind that made everything feel a degree thinner and louder. My boots crunched gravel; the lantern painted the stones in a small, moving circle of light. The east side held the oldest plots—tall marble markers, family vaults, oaks with roots like sleeping snakes. I stuck to the grass edges, keeping my steps muted, letting the night do its work of making ordinary things foreboding.

Halfway through that round I heard it: a scrape, at first so small I thought it might be wind kissing a branch. Then it found a rhythm—metal on earth, a hollow, persistent sound like somebody raking bones. My stomach tightened. The sound wasn't animal. It was deliberate. I let the lantern dim to a sliver and crept toward it, moving in the low mode that made everything smell sharper—damp leaves, old stone, the faint copper of buried things.

They were behind a great oak by a family vault, humped over a fresh mound. Two men, shoulders bent, breathing hard in the cold. One drove a spade into the earth with slow, practiced strokes; the other clawed at the loose soil with his bare hands. The hole was three feet deep and still yawning, the edge of a wooden box glinting under the dirt like a promise broken. A ribbon of disturbed earth ran from the grave to the back fence, cutting through the neat lines of the lawn.

""Hey!"" I called, and my voice sounded too loud, like somebody had turned on a horn inside my chest. I stepped forward, stick up. My voice tried to be solid; inside I felt hollow and small.

They jumped. The taller of the two spun, spade ready. He had a beard that caught the lantern’s light—livid stubble and eyes that darted, hunted. The other was shorter, squat and quick, mud smearing his jaw. ""Mind your business, guard,"" the tall one snarled. His voice scraped like gravel.

""It's my business,"" I said. ""You drop that and come with me. Police will sort this out.""

The short one laughed—low and bitter. ""He thinks he's tough, Bill. What do we do with him?""

Bill—tall, spade-clenched—stepped forward. ""We can't let him blab. Grab him, Joe.""

My heart kicked against my ribs. For a second I imagined calling it off, letting them go, letting myself off the hook. But then Joe lunged. He moved like someone who had spent a life crawling through the dark—fast, without ceremony. He grabbed my arm. I twisted, let the stick come down hard across his shoulder. He howled and crumpled, but Bill swung. The spade sliced the air and caught my coat, ripping fabric and skin; pain bloomed along my ribs like a red sun.

I staggered, the world tilting, and stumbled into a headstone. Pain sharpened everything—breath, sound, the metallic taste at the back of my tongue. I scrambled for the gatehouse, for the whistle I kept under the counter like a small, useless prayer. Their footsteps thudded close behind me, panic hot and stupid in my ears. ""Stop him!"" Bill barked.

I dashed between graves, the lantern swinging so the light made crazy faces of the stones. Roots threatened to snag my feet; once I nearly went down, fingers clinging to damp earth. Joe caught me where the ground sagged, tackling me to the mud. His hands were at my throat and the smell of him—sour, sweaty—filled my head. ""You shouldn't have come snooping,"" he hissed.

I fought with a sort of stupid, animal stubbornness. I kneed him in the gut, grabbed the stick, swung until wood cracked against bone. He fell back, gasping. Bill came at me with the spade raised to finish whatever plan they had—whatever it was they thought a grave could give them. I hit his arm. He dropped the spade and cursed, a rough, ragged sound that might as well have been a plea.

For a moment, everything hung on that thinness of time: the ragged breathing, the dark rubbing at the edges, the knowledge that we were three people alone among a hundred dead. I pointed the stick at them like a ridiculous spear and barked, ""Leave, now. Or I'll make sure you both end up in one of these holes permanent.""

They measured me with narrow eyes. Joe reached for Bill, helped him up, and they moved as if their decision had been made in a single look. ""This ain't over,"" Joe spat. ""We'll be back.""

They fled toward the back fence, tools slapping against their boots, swallowed by the dark beyond the trees. I watched them go, every muscle taut, breath ragged and raw. When they were gone the night seemed to exhale.

I went back to the open grave. The coffin lay cracked, its lid splintered and thrown aside like a discarded thought, empty as a promise. The earth around it held the impression of hands—human and hurried. Whoever had been beneath was gone. My mind flicked through criminal possibilities: a grave raided for valuables, a body taken for some grotesque trade, a cadaver sold to a backroom medical shop. But the detail that stayed with me was the way the soil had been upended in a hurry, the way the hands had dug with panic as much as purpose.

I blew the whistle until my lungs hurt. The sound peeled over the stones and into the town like an accusation. Someone came by morning—police with gloves and cameras, earnest faces that made a show of being comforted by procedure. They marked tape around the plot and took notes; they asked questions that scraped at the edges of what had happened. The men were gone. The oak smelled the same. The flowers on neighboring graves nodded as if nothing had happened.

I quit that job before the week was out. Maybe I quit to keep my skin, or maybe because I had seen with my eyes that the dark could be practical and patient, that it had accomplices who worked with tools and timing. Nights later, I would still feel the scrape of a spade in my dreams, the angry, brittle sound of it in the earth—proof that some things in the dark were not merely stories to frighten children, but business, cold and human, and entirely capable of bankruptcy of conscience.





# ""Disturbed Earth"":

I started my shift at the cemetery the same way I always did—checking the locks on the main gate, testing the fence line, and making sure no one had slipped in after hours. It wasn’t glamorous work, but it paid decent, and after leaving the army, I needed something steady. Most nights were quiet. I’d walk the gravel paths with my flashlight, listening to the wind slide through the cypress trees and the distant hum of trucks on the highway. Peaceful, in its own strange way. But that one night in late summer—everything changed.

I carried the usual gear: a radio on my belt, a heavy Maglite in my hand, and a ring of keys that jingled with every step. The cemetery was sprawling—twenty acres of sloping ground, headstones leaning from age, some polished and new, others so weatherworn the names were almost gone. I knew it like a second home by then. The family plots were near the front under the yellow glow of the streetlights; the older sections were deeper in, where the trees grew thick and the air always felt a few degrees colder.

My routine was simple: a patrol every hour, checking for vandals or kids sneaking in to prove their courage. Most people thought cemeteries were eerie. To me, it was quiet ground—somewhere I could think.

It was just after one in the morning when I heard it—a faint, metallic scraping, like metal biting into earth. I froze. The sound came again: steady, deliberate, too rhythmic to be an animal. I switched off my flashlight and crouched behind a tall monument, letting my eyes adjust to the faint glow of the moon. The sound was coming from beyond a row of old mausoleums, fifty yards or so away.

I keyed my radio. “Base, this is Post 3. I’ve got activity near the west section—possible trespassers.”

Static. Then the dispatcher’s drowsy voice crackled through. “Probably raccoons. Check it out and report back.”

I muttered a curse and moved closer, keeping low between the stones. The scraping grew louder—accompanied now by low voices. Two of them. Male. One spoke sharply; the other chuckled under his breath. I eased around a bush and finally saw them.

Two figures hunched over a fresh grave. The dirt was piled high beside them, and a lantern burned low on the ground, throwing a dim orange halo across their faces. One wore a dark hoodie, the other a tattered brown jacket. They were working a shovel into the soil with grim focus. Grave robbers.

I’d heard rumors from the day staff—stories about thieves stealing jewelry, even brass nameplates to sell for scrap. But seeing it in front of me made my chest tighten.

I stepped out, raising my flashlight. “Hey! What the hell do you think you’re doing? This place is closed.”

The one in the hoodie jolted upright, dropping his shovel. He was younger—early twenties maybe—with jittery, nervous movements. “Easy, man,” he stammered. “We’re just visiting family.”

“Family doesn’t visit at one in the morning with tools.”

The older one straightened slowly, brushing dirt from his hands. He had a scar that ran from his temple down his cheek, and a smile that didn’t match his eyes. “No need to get worked up, guard. We’re almost done here. How about you look the other way? We can make it worth your while. There’s gold in this one—old lady, buried with her rings.”

I shook my head. “Leave now, or I call the cops.”

He sighed, that crooked smile never fading. “You sure about that?”

I thumbed the radio. “Base, I’ve got two intruders at section G, digging up a grave. Send police.”

The younger one’s face twisted. “You shouldn’t have done that.” He lunged forward, grabbing the shovel. I barely dodged, but the edge clipped my shoulder hard enough to send pain flashing down my arm. I stumbled, dropped the flashlight. It rolled, casting dizzying arcs of light across the gravestones.

The older man came at me fast. I caught the faint scent of sweat and sour breath before his fist slammed into my ribs. The air shot out of me. I swung wildly, connecting just enough to make him grunt. We grappled in the dirt, boots slipping, our breathing ragged. I felt his hand grab for my radio—snatched it before he could pull it free.

“Walk away,” he hissed. “You didn’t see anything.”

“Not a chance,” I spat, shoving him back.

The younger man swung the shovel again. I caught the handle mid-swing and wrenched it free. He lunged at me, clawing at my jacket. I kicked his knee, and he went down hard, crying out. But before I could get my balance, the older one tackled me from behind. We went down together, rolling through the soft soil. My flashlight beam danced over the open grave, showing the gleam of the coffin lid beneath the dirt. They were nearly done.

I got my knee into his chest and managed to hold him there for a moment. “Why?” I demanded, breathless. “Why rob the dead?”

“For the living,” he snarled. “You think anyone misses what’s buried with them?”

His nephew—the younger one—grabbed a rock from the dirt pile. His shadow loomed over us. I saw the rock lift, the moon glinting off its edge. Instinct took over—I rolled just as it came down. It slammed into the ground inches from my head.

Adrenaline roared through me. I swung the flashlight up, connecting with the kid’s arm. He screamed, dropped the rock.

“Run!” the older one barked, dragging him up. They sprinted toward the tree line, disappearing into the dark, leaving their tools scattered around the half-dug grave.

I leaned against a headstone, gasping for air, every muscle shaking. “Base,” I rasped into the radio. “Intruders fleeing east side. I’m injured. Send backup now.”

The wail of sirens cut through the night a few minutes later, red and blue lights flashing across the graves like restless spirits. The officers found the disturbed plot, the shovel marks biting deep into the coffin lid. They hadn’t opened it yet, but they were close.

I got patched up—bruised ribs, a split lip, nothing permanent. The cops took my statement. Two days later, they caught the pair trying to pawn off rings from another cemetery upstate. The older one had a long rap sheet; the younger was his nephew, barely twenty, desperate for cash. They both went away for a long time.

I kept the job for another year, but I never looked at the place the same again. The silence that once felt peaceful now had weight to it. Every creak of a branch, every whisper of wind between the stones—it all carried a memory of that night.

People think cemeteries are haunted by the dead. But they’re wrong. The real danger walks on two legs—greedy, desperate, and willing to dig through the dirt for anything worth taking.",1,1761292654.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I'm hoping someone can save my sanity. I've been going back and forth over one little icon since September. If you can solve this for me I'm happy to buy you a coffee. I'm dead serious, please help 😭

I'm a designer currently working with dev who reported that a small notification icon was broken on Android 14 and lower, saying that we can't use color because ""Android doesn't support it."" He's saying it has to be transparent with a ""white or gray"" shape then later said ""all-white."" I immediately assumed he was confusing ""monochromatic"" with ""black and white,"" because I dealt with adaptive icon confusion like that a lot back when it first came out in 2018 or whenever it was. After trying to get more details on the issue and getting nowhere, I gave up and sent him an icon package using Google's own template like I've been doing for years, called it a day.

Now he's said he ""tried it"" and it doesn't work, still shows as a blank circle somehow. Then he wrote out some weird specs (""Color is not allowed"") and linked the adaptive icon docs, and of course none of the specs he sent are anywhere in the docs. Pretty sure they were AI generated - it must be a PNG but also should be a vector, etc

To me it sounds like he's not setting the layers correctly in Image Asset Studio, not using it at all, or... I have no idea, I'm not a dev 😩

Have all the devs I've worked with over the past 7 years been taking my assets and editing them themselves to create a grayscale version specifically for that notification icon, and just not saying anything to me? If so, can someone please point me to the actual specs so I can learn and export with the correct size/color profile? I've never had to provide anything but a monochrome icon package.

This is such a dumb issue that I don't have time to fight over, I'm about to provide him with the damn white icon and just accept we won't have an adaptive icon..

After literally 1,700+ wash cycles (3-4x per week):
- Zero repairs, zero service calls
- Motor still whisper quiet at 1600rpm
- Drum and door seal perfect
- CapDosing still works flawlessly

Look at that display - still crisp and bright after a decade of use.

At work, we have this little ritual where we all join a “coffee chat” Zoom on Fridays — basically just talking nonsense for 15 minutes before actually doing our jobs. Usually, it’s stuff like “what’s your favorite pizza topping” or “what show are you watching lately.”

This week’s question was: *“What’s a random childhood memory that still makes you laugh?”*

Everyone went around saying normal, funny things like “I once ate dog food” or “my brother convinced me the moon was following us.”  
When it was my turn, my brain went completely blank… and for some reason, I blurted out a story that was *way too dark* for a coffee chat.

I said, *“Oh yeah, one time when I was 10, I tried to make my own fireworks with matches and a deodorant can.”*  
Everyone laughed nervously, so of course, I doubled down and said, *“It exploded. I didn’t have eyebrows for two weeks.”*

Silence. Just… silence.

Then my manager went, “Oh… wow. You’re okay though, right?”  
And I just nodded while sipping my coffee like it was no big deal, but inside my soul was disintegrating.

Now they all treat me like I’m some chaotic gremlin who might blow up the office microwave any second. I tried to joke about it later, but every time someone lights a candle, they just… look at me.

**TL;DR:** Tried to share a funny childhood story at work, accidentally confessed to committing mild arson as a kid, and now everyone thinks I’m a walking hazard sign.",0,1761291807.0,tifu,10,0.45,False

I want to meet someone I can grow with, share ideas with, and build a connection that feels genuine and steady. Someone I can study with, talk to about random thoughts, and maybe one day, plan a life with.

All I ask for is a connection that feels light but meaningful. The kind that makes you want to work on yourself while cheering each other on.

**About me:**

* 22 years old
* 154 cm
* Normal BMI, not in the gym era but I do daily walks
* A reviewee for boards
* No vices, though I occasionally drink socially with close friends (only if there’s karaoke involved, not the club type)
* Emotionally stable. I value accountability and clear communication. I want to connect deeply and honestly with someone who’s emotionally mature and self-aware
* Hobbies. Reading, studying in cafes, and spending quiet moments in nature. I love coffee, art museums, and playlists that match the mood
* Personality. Ambitious but calm. I enjoy thoughtful conversations more than small talk. I like people who are driven but still grounded

**About you:**

* Early to late twenties
* Taller than me
* You’re the type who’s driven but knows when to slow down and breathe. I’m drawn to men who are passionate about their goals but still make time for real connections
* Single and emotionally ready. Not still healing, not testing the waters — just at peace and open to something genuine
* I don’t have fixed preferences on looks, but let’s be real that it is a factor in getting to know someone
* I appreciate men who know how to lead calmly, listen sincerely, and speak with intention
* You don’t play around or entertain people just for attention. You know what you want and you act on it
* You can talk about your goals, frustrations, or even random thoughts at 2 AM without feeling like it’s too much
* You value effort, presence, and peace over drama and inconsistency
* You’ve made peace with your past and you’re not dragging it into new connections. I want to meet someone who’s present, mature, and emotionally safe to be with
* You’re not afraid of quiet moments. You find beauty in calm company — whether it’s studying together, having coffee in silence, or exchanging thoughts that make us both reflect

I’m not in a rush to fall in love, but I believe that the right person will feel like calm and motivation at the same time. Maybe we’ll start by studying together, exchanging ideas, or just keeping each other inspired. And if it grows into something deeper, then that’s a story worth telling.

TL;DR: Over a few months, a male colleague from a similar background engaged in constant attention, teasing, personal questions, and flirtatious banter. What was this?

Context 
· Same age/background 
· We'd seen each other around but never worked together until this point.

- When he first met one on one, he started with a barrage of personal questions: my ethnicity, family background, education, age, siblings, and if I lived with my parents. He apologized for ""asking so many questions.""
- He repeatedly brought up my name, commented on it, asked how to pronounce it, and would just say it out loud for no reason, when I questioned him on it just went “nothing just like saying your name”. Did a lot of playful teasing (calling me out for being stressed, saying I do nothing)
- Quite chatty, always starting conversations (not just with me though, he’d do it with other colleagues too) asking about my valentines weekend (which made other colleagues giggle), offered me a ride (despite joking that he saw me whilst driving past one day, considered giving me a ride but then thought nah, then also said if I need one in the future to let him know??), my leave, my plans, noticing when I took a random day off.
- Frequently thanked me for help, said ""you're the best,"" and emphasized that he ""owed me one” bringing up buying me coffee multiple times (didn’t follow through though)
- Sat next to me when other seats were free, just once he initiated light, playful physical contact like kicking my chair or tapping my shoulder to get my attention.
- Asked, in a group setting, what our first impressions of each other were, would repeatedly bring up our shared background to others out of nowhere
- He made comments like ""I'll really miss you"" and, ""When is the last time I'm going to see you?"" On the last day, he was hovering, asking if I needed help, and repeated his thanks.

· Despite this, nothing further happened.
· for further context, he was also playfully rude and teased other female colleagues at times (to the point where one called him out on flirting with everyone)
· He did once say he would never pursue someone at work
· Also found out from a mutual colleague that at a party, other girls had pointed him out as ""cute"" and tried to get an introduction, but he was already with another girl. This was before we met (at which point I was in a relationship, he was single and would say things in group settings like “now I just need to find me a wife” etc.)

1oerf4m,https://i.redd.it/dj18gxeri0xf1.jpeg,Charcoal Toothpaste: Whitening Hype or Enamel Hazard?,"At [Jabade Dental](https://jabadedentalpune.in/), Kasba Peth, we’ve noticed a growing trend among patients turning to **charcoal toothpastes** for “natural” teeth whitening. Marketed as detoxifying and stain-removing, these black-colored toothpastes promise brighter smiles — but are they truly safe for your enamel?

If you’ve been searching for a **Dentist near me in Kasba Peth** and are curious whether charcoal toothpaste is worth using, this article breaks down the facts and science behind this popular dental trend.



# What Is Charcoal Toothpaste?

Charcoal toothpaste contains **activated charcoal**, a fine black powder made from substances like coconut shells or wood that are heated at high temperatures. It’s known for its ability to absorb toxins and chemicals, which is why it’s often used in skincare and detox products.

In toothpaste, it’s marketed to remove surface stains, whiten teeth, and “detoxify” your mouth. However, these claims are not as straightforward as they seem.



# How Charcoal Toothpaste Works

Charcoal toothpaste works by using its **abrasive texture** to scrub away surface stains caused by coffee, tea, or smoking. While it may make teeth appear temporarily whiter, it does not chemically whiten or change the color of your enamel like professional whitening treatments.



# The Risks of Using Charcoal Toothpaste

# 1. Enamel Erosion

Charcoal particles can be coarse and abrasive. Over time, excessive scrubbing can wear down the enamel — the protective outer layer of your teeth — leading to sensitivity and increased risk of decay.

# 2. Gum Irritation

Frequent contact with abrasive particles can irritate the gums, making them more prone to bleeding and inflammation.

# 3. No Fluoride Protection

Most charcoal toothpastes **lack fluoride**, which is essential for preventing cavities and strengthening enamel.

# 4. Staining Restorations

Charcoal can get trapped in small cracks or on dental restorations like fillings and crowns, causing a grayish tint.

# 5. False Whitening Effect

Charcoal toothpaste removes surface stains but doesn’t affect deeper discoloration. The “whitening” is often just polishing off external residue.



# What the Research Says

According to studies published in the *Journal of the American Dental Association (JADA)*, there’s insufficient scientific evidence to support claims that charcoal toothpastes are effective or safe for long-term use. Researchers warn that the abrasiveness can lead to **permanent enamel loss** if used regularly.



# Safer Alternatives for Whitening

If you’re looking for a brighter smile without risking enamel damage, consider:

* **Professional teeth cleaning** at **Jabade Dental**, which removes surface stains safely.
* **In-office whitening treatments**, which are both effective and enamel-safe.
* **Fluoride-based whitening toothpaste** for gentle daily maintenance.



# Why Choose Jabade Dental

# Final Thoughts

Charcoal toothpastes may seem appealing, but their abrasive nature can do more harm than good. Enamel doesn’t regenerate once it’s lost — making caution essential. For safe, professional whitening and enamel care, consult your dentist before trying any new product.

I'm trying to figure out which cruise to book as part of my Florida vacation in Jan/Feb 2026. I am a woman travelling alone, 27 years old and more interested in sports, finding travel buddies and cultural experiences than extensive parties.

1. I'm trying to decide between three options that differ in ship and route (it's german but hopefully self-explanatory apart from ""Nächte""=nights). Which one would you choose and why?

2. Is there usually some sort of solo traveller meet-up on board? I've heard that this is common on German cruising lines but don't know about MSC. 

3. I could book the easy drink package right away. However, I don't drink alcohol and would mostly stick to water, coffee and diet coke. From what I understand these beverages would be included at the buffet. Is there any reason to book a drink package under these circumstances? Or is there a cheaper option than booking the easy package now?

I'm excited to hear about your experiences :)",2,1761290871.0,MSCCruises,3,1.0,False
1oerccq,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/1oerccq/the_marriage_squeeze_in_rural_areas_and_the/,"The ""marriage squeeze"" in rural areas, and the ""PPB""-like situations in small town/rural Scandinavia","TLDR: We have PPB in rural scandinavia as well, but it's older than the internet itself in some places. My male dominated industrial smalltown has had a shitty dating market for the under 40's for decades, and ""PPB"" has been a solution for many local men. Personal story on the bottom.



I've seen a lot of posts and comments here recently, saying that passport bros, or people with foreign spouses, are ""losers who can't get laid"", or ""the women being in it for the money"" but one post also caught my attention because it said that the lower cost of living made dating more accessible for passport bros from high COL countries. 

In my case, there was no cost question involved at all. Back when I was a single bachelor I could spend any money in the world to meet a good woman. Money is not a problem for me due to my career and low COL because I live in a small city in western Norway, with a huge gender imbalance for us under 40. Dating is not possible. Even for men with good careers, looks, and their own home.

The gender imbalance has always been there, but since the 70's ish, it has been fueled by women dominating university attendance. This means that they will move to a big city to study, and when they have finished their degree they can only find work relevant for their degree in urban environments. Before universal higher education, a lot of the women would move to the big cities to become maids for wealthy families or take nursing training at central hospitals.

The few women that are left, are either overvalued, taken, disabled or have other red flags that make then unable to attend higher education or unsuitable for a serious relationship. Many of them are on disability, or work blue collar jobs in the service industry or within healthcare. The ones on disability can be a mixed bunch of mentally ill women on drugs, and actual vegetables on life support.

A ""normal"" girl with a steady job will have many suitors. They know it, and act accordingly. A 4 in Oslo, can be a 10 in certain places in northern and western Norway. 

The term ""Passport bro"" doesn't exist in Norway, we use terms jokingly like ""han har hentet seg kone"" - ""he has gone to pick up a wife"", ""Asiafrelst"" - Someone who has received salvation from Asia, and ""Thailandsfarer"" - Based on the ""Englandsfarer"" from ww2 which was a group of norwegian partisans along the western coast, that fled to England during the german occupation, using fishing boats. During the war they conducted everything from secret raids on german military installations, weapons transports, refugee evacuation, evacuation of partisans, and distribution of food and mediale supplies to coastal communities. 

In coastal western and northern Norway this has existed for a long time. It started with sailors and captains in the trade fleet taking home wives from the Phillipines or Thailand. 

In the 80's it exploded in popularity because young women fled rural areas in droves for free education on all levels. A lot of the old sailors from the trade fleet had gone over to become oil rig workers, with generous vacation and leave policies when they were not at sea. They would fly to SEA on the newly established flight routes from Europe to Thailand and PH, and they would stay there for months, many bringing home wives to live with them in their small towns in the western coast of Norway.

There even was a TV show about this phemenon, it's called ""et lite stykke Thailand"" and features a village not far from my town where several of the men have thai wives.

Since then it has been very common, many ""dead"" towns and villages have been revitalized. Their kids are filling up schools that were destined to be shut down due to low student count. Main streets have asian food stores, restaurants, nail salons, skincare salons, and massage parlors. Some towns have buddhist temples and filipino style mass in newly established or revitalized catholic churches. Some places have so big thai and pinay communities that they will fly in singers from their countries to host concerts. These are big events that attract thai/ph people from across the nordics to a small town. 

We make fun of the ""marriage squeeze"" that men in China face due to the one child policy, but rural men in the west have faced this since before the formation of the People's Republic of China.


Now back to me and why I chose dating abroad:

I'm white, 27, 75kg, 180cm tall (5'11 ish?),  I'm skinny but not muscular but I do keep fit from skiing, swimming, and cycling. I have a higher vocational engineering degree taken at the local trade college, and a good white-collar career within industrial IT and machinery in the maritime sector where i usually end up earning over 100k$ a year, before taxes. It's a stable job where I am the youngest guy in the office, most of my colleagues have worked at the same place for 20+ years.

This is very typical for many men in this region. There are many specialized fields within high value coastal industries that have education paths that are popular with men. A lot of guys in their 20's and 30's here have no partner despite good looks, wealth, and well paying jobs they can't move to cities with more women in them. A lot of people in the big cities joke about our region, saying that all you can do here is ""hike in nature and be an engineer"".

I've tried dating locally here, there is lots of competition and no way to stand out. I also asked my cousin who married a local woman, to introduce me to single female friends, but that didn't work out much either. I grew up partially abroad and I'm 50% norwegian and 50% from another western european country, I therefore don't click 100% into norwegian dating culture, because I spent majority of my childhood and teens abroad. 

I downloaded several dating apps and noticed that I was incredibly popular with beautiful women located in Asia, or asian women studying or working in europe. I traveled to meet a lot of them, had a couple of girlfriends, some living with me here.

Then on a faithful day while staying in the home country of my mother, and taking care of her while she was on her deathbed. I met a beautiful vietnamese nurse that was working as a guest worker. My dad and I bonded with her over caring for my mother. One day i asked her out on a date, and we originally went for coffee at a cafe after her work was finished. But we had such a great time that we spontaneously went for a movie at the cinema, and went for a walk through the city where we ended up holding hands, at last I walked her all the way to the doorstep of her dorm building.

I was so infatuated with her that I gave her a kiss, she didn't flinch, she just giggled, gave me a smile i can never forget, and said to me that this was her first kiss. Many more kisses were given on that doorstep before we parted ways that night. 

A few days after, my mother passed away due to her terminal illness and I became busy with arranging funeral, paperwork, inheritance, and transfer of my mothers remains back to our family tomb in Norway. 
After the funeral, i asked this nurse to be my girlfriend, she said yes, on one condition, that I meet her family in Vietnam. We immediately ordered tickets together for summer vacation in her home city in Vietnam. But we did not wait until summer to travel together, I took her to cities and countries around europe, showing her the places where I grew up, and also discovering new countries together. 

I came to meet her family and was greeted with hospitality and flowers from my now in-laws. I was included in everything they did throughout the day, they took me to the temple, to the market, to work, to drink tea or beer with faraway relatives and business partners. To thank for all the kindness and hospitality I was shown, i hired a minibus and driver, and took the entire extended family to a resort, that my girlfriend had picked out. All expenses paid by me.

When her working contract slowly came to an end, and a local housing crisis due to the war in Ukraine made working in that country unviable for her. I had already prepared and gone to Vietnam on my own to ask her parents for her hand in marriage.

Her brother, who I see as my best friend, gathered both parents and grandparents for me to ask for her hand. I got a yes, and I told them that I would spend the next few days there so that they could ask me about any questions or concerns they had. I patiently listened to their concerns about her future, and reassuringly answered them all and promised to take good care of her if she chooses to marry me.

I proposed in the other country, in her dorm with a diamond ring. Arriving there unannounced. And got a yes and a followup question if I had asked her parents, then I told her about what I had been doing before I came to her unannounced. 

Following came a lot of paperwork and helping her move back to Vietnam for a while for her to wait for her paperwork so that we could legally marry in the norwegian embassy. Then came the waiting time for her visa. We then had weddings in Norway and in Vietnam. Her nieces and nephews call me uncle, and we both took her maiden name as our middle name. (My business card always sparks curiosity now)

We are married and living here in my small town, she is soon finished with her language course, and I take her to volunteer programs to learn extra norwegian, to give her an advantage to the other students. We still travel around the country and around europe like we did back when we were just dating. 

She has already been offered work in several local nursing homes when she feels confident in her language skills. She fills my home with joy, love, and home cooked meals. I work from home a lot now, to spend as much time with her as possible, we share the household chores together, and she will take naps in the bed next to my desk while i work, or ask me questions about norwegian grammar while bringing me vietnamese coffee and fresh fruit. 

Had I not decided for a foreign woman, I would still be sitting in my house, alone, like so many of my friends who still live here.",16,1761290810.0,thepassportbros,9,0.94,False

I’m 37, chapstick, and a lifelong learner. I’ve always been curious about the world and tend to think deeply about most things — sometimes a little too much, but that’s part of the fun. I love meaningful conversations, quiet evenings, and finding humor in life’s little absurdities. I also genuinely enjoy noticing the small details that make life interesting — a perfect cup of coffee, a sunset, or a random silly observation that makes you laugh.

I know how lonely it can feel when it seems like no one really gets you. I’m looking for a feminine woman who values kindness, honesty, and real connection — someone who enjoys thoughtful talks, cozy moments, and can laugh at life without taking everything too seriously. Life feels richer when shared, even in the quiet moments.

LDR is totally fine, and even a simple “hi” could be the start of something fun. If you’re looking for someone who will listen, laugh, and genuinely try to understand, I’d love to hear from you. Maybe we’ll find a little spark of connection — or at least share a few laughs along the way.

Never again. After three years of one-bagging through Southeast Asia, Europe, and way too many budget airline terminals, I've learned something crucial: you don't need to drop $200+ on a travel backpack to travel smart.

The sweet spot? Right around $50-$100. Here's what actually works.

>🧠 **Still deciding?** You don’t need to reread the whole post. I’ve summarized all key specs, prices, and models inside a [**Backpack Comparison Sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16n-yjeyMhoZ3Jeut6NOWVY29Uz9RLUJROgv22E8POrI/).  
Think of it as your **cheat sheet** to finding the right backpack — free, easy to use, and updated regularly.

# 1. Amazon Basics Carry-On Travel Backpack — The Budget Champion ($50)

I know what you're thinking. Amazon Basics? Really?

Here's the thing: I was skeptical too. But after testing this workhorse on a two-week trip through Portugal, I get why it has thousands of five-star reviews.

**What Makes It Work:**

The 40-liter capacity (expandable from 35L) swallows everything for a week-long trip. The clamshell opening means you're not digging through layers to find that one shirt at the bottom. When I landed in Porto at 6 AM, jet-lagged and desperate for my hoodie, I could lay it flat and grab what I needed in seconds.

The laptop compartment is generously sized—easily fits a 15-inch MacBook with room for a tablet and documents. Multiple internal pockets keep smaller items from becoming black holes at the bottom of your bag.

**The Reality Check:**

It's not going to last you ten years. The polyester feels cheaper than premium bags, and one of my zipper pulls did come loose after heavy use. But at $50? I could replace it three times before hitting the cost of a high-end pack.

The shoulder straps are lightly padded—fine for short walks, less comfortable if you're hiking uphill to your Airbnb for 20 minutes. The hip belt is there, but it's thin and doesn't distribute weight like pricier options.

**Best For:** Budget-conscious travelers, first-time one-baggers, people who fly more than they walk.

# 2. Osprey Daylite Plus — The Versatile Workhorse ($75)

This 20-liter pack has become my go-everywhere companion. I've used it as my personal item on flights, my daypack while exploring cities, and even stuffed it into a larger bag for hiking summit attempts.

**What I Love:**

At just over a pound, it disappears on your back. The breathable mesh back panel actually works—no sweat-soaked shirt after walking through humid Bangkok. The padded laptop sleeve fits a 14-inch MacBook perfectly, and the front organizational pocket keeps my passport, phone charger, and snacks accessible.

The build quality is classic Osprey: 300D recycled polyester that's held up through rain showers, being stuffed into overhead bins, and general travel abuse. After a year of heavy use, mine looks barely worn.

**The Honest Drawbacks:**

It's not going to hold clothes for a week. This is a daypack that can pinch-hit as a weekend bag, not a full travel backpack. I can fit two days' worth of clothes if I pack strategically with compression cubes, but that's pushing it.

There's no rigid frame, so it sags when full. You'll want packing cubes to keep everything organized.

**Best For:** Digital nomads needing a work/exploration pack, travelers using it as a personal item, anyone wanting quality that lasts.

# 3. Osprey Farpoint 40 — The Comfort King (Around $100 on Sale)

Technically this usually sits at $110-140, but it regularly goes on sale for under $100, and when it does, grab it. I bought mine during an Amazon Prime Day sale for $98, and three years later, it's still my main travel bag.

**Why It's Worth Waiting For:**

The comfort level is absurd for a travel pack. The padded hip belt, adjustable torso, and ventilated back panel make this feel like a hiking backpack—because that's essentially what Osprey did. They took their trail expertise and applied it to travel.

I've carried this fully loaded through airport terminals, up cobblestone streets in Lisbon, and on a three-hour train journey where I had to stand. My back didn't hate me afterward.

The internal organization includes compression straps, zippered mesh pockets, and a spacious main compartment that opens like a suitcase. Living out of this bag for weeks feels manageable, not chaotic.

**The Tradeoffs:**

It's heavier than minimalist options at 3.3 pounds empty. When you're counting ounces for airline weight limits, that matters.

The design is practical, not pretty. If you want something sleek for the office, this isn't it. But if you want something that works? This works.

**Best For:** Serious travelers, hostel-hoppers, anyone who values comfort over aesthetics.

# 4. Topo Designs Rover Pack — The Stylish Survivor ($85)

Sometimes you want a bag that doesn't scream ""tourist."" The Rover Pack nails that.

**What Sets It Apart:**

The 20-liter capacity is perfect for day trips or as a personal item. But what caught my attention is the 1000D nylon construction—this thing is bombproof. I've thrown it on gravel, caught it on door handles, and stuffed it carelessly into overhead bins. Not a single tear or sign of wear.

The top-loading design with a yellow interior lining is genius. You can actually see everything when looking down into the bag, unlike black-hole packs where items mysteriously disappear.

**The Honest Assessment:**

Top-loading means accessibility is slower. If you need quick access to multiple items, this will frustrate you. I've learned to pack strategically—frequently needed items go in the front pocket.

The vertical storage means things stack on top of each other. Your phone charger might end up buried under a water bottle if you're not careful.

**Best For:** City explorers, style-conscious travelers, people who want a bag that looks good at coffee shops and mountain trails alike.

# 5. JanSport Right Pack — The No-Nonsense Classic ($65)

This is the bag equivalent of a reliable Honda Civic. Boring? Maybe. But it'll outlast flashier options.

**The Appeal:**

JanSport's lifetime warranty is no joke. When my friend's 15-year-old Right Pack finally had a strap issue, they fixed it for free. That kind of backing changes how you think about a $65 purchase.

The 31-liter capacity holds a surprising amount. I've fit three days of clothes, a laptop, a book, and snacks without issue. The simple design—two padded straps, a main compartment, front pocket—means there's nothing to break.

**What It Lacks:**

Features. There's no hip belt, no fancy organizational system, no water-resistant coating. This is a backpack in its purest form, which can be freeing or frustrating depending on your needs.

Comfort is basic. The padding is adequate, not exceptional. After an hour of walking with a full load, you'll feel it.

**Best For:** Minimalists, people who value simplicity, travelers who'd rather spend money on experiences than gear.

# 6. REI Co-op Flash 22 — The Ultralight Specialist ($60)

Weighing just 14 ounces, this is the packable option you stuff into your main bag for day excursions.

**The Magic:**

It compresses down to the size of a grapefruit. On my last trip to Japan, I kept it in my main backpack until I needed a daypack for hiking around Kyoto. Then it expanded to a full 22 liters that held water, snacks, a rain jacket, and my camera.

For $60, you get REI's quality—durable ripstop nylon, solid YKK zippers, and thoughtful touches like a key clip and internal sleeve for a hydration bladder or laptop.

**The Limitations:**

Minimal padding means minimal comfort with heavy loads. This works for light days, not hauling gear across cities.

No rigid structure means the bag is only as organized as you make it. Without packing cubes, everything becomes a jumbled mess.

**Best For:** Hikers who want a summit pack, travelers needing a packable daypack, ultralight enthusiasts.

>⚡ Don’t waste time reading specs — open the [**Backpack Finder Sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16n-yjeyMhoZ3Jeut6NOWVY29Uz9RLUJROgv22E8POrI/) and filter by brand, laptop size, or price right now.

# The Real Talk About Budget Backpacks

None of these bags will be perfect. At this price point, you're making tradeoffs—maybe it's durability, maybe it's features, maybe it's comfort. The key is matching those tradeoffs to your travel style.

If you fly budget airlines and walk short distances, grab the Amazon Basics. If you're living nomadically and need comfort, wait for the Farpoint to go on sale. If you want something that works everywhere without making you look like you're on a gap year, the Topo Designs fits the bill.

I've made the mistake of buying cheap gear that fell apart mid-trip. But I've also wasted money on expensive bags with features I never used. These six hit that sweet spot: affordable enough to not stress over, quality enough to actually rely on.

1oer606,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1oer606/best_travel_backpack_with_luggage_sleeve/,Best Travel Backpack With Luggage Sleeve,"I learned about trolley sleeves the hard way.

Picture this: LAX terminal, 6 AM, me juggling a rolling suitcase with one hand while my overstuffed backpack kept sliding off my shoulder. I'd stop every thirty seconds to hoist it back up, wrestling my carry-on through crowds while desperately trying to hold my coffee and boarding pass. By the time I reached my gate, my shoulder ached and I was seriously questioning my packing choices.

Then I discovered backpacks with luggage sleeves—those genius straps on the back that slide over your suitcase handle—and honestly, it changed everything. No more shoulder pain. No more bag juggling. Just smooth, one-handed gliding through airports like I actually knew what I was doing.

Here's what I've learned after testing various options across business trips, weekend getaways, and that chaotic two-week Europe adventure.

>🧠 **Still deciding?** You don’t need to reread the whole post. I’ve summarized all key specs, prices, and models inside a [**Backpack Comparison Sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16n-yjeyMhoZ3Jeut6NOWVY29Uz9RLUJROgv22E8POrI/).  
Think of it as your **cheat sheet** to finding the right backpack — free, easy to use, and updated regularly.

# What Makes a Luggage Sleeve Actually Useful?

A luggage sleeve (also called a trolley sleeve) is basically a pass-through strap or pocket on the back of your backpack that slides over your suitcase handle. Simple concept, huge difference.

But here's the catch: not all luggage sleeves work equally well. Some are too tight when your bag is fully packed. Others let your backpack wobble around like it's trying to escape. The best ones? They grip securely, accommodate different handle widths, and don't require a wrestling match to get on or off.

# The Backpacks That Actually Deliver

# 1. MATEIN Travel Backpack — Best Budget Pick ($36)

This was my surprise favorite during a last-minute Denver trip. At around $36 on Amazon, I honestly didn't expect much, but this thing performed.

The trolley sleeve worked flawlessly with my rolling bag—no wobbling, no sliding. The clamshell opening (where it unzips like a suitcase) is genuinely brilliant. Instead of digging to the bottom like a normal backpack, everything just...opens. Found my charger in seconds.

It fits a 15.6"" laptop, has a separate shoe compartment (lifesaver after beach days), and includes 20+ pockets. Yes, twenty. Is that excessive? Maybe. Did I use most of them? Absolutely.

The expandable feature gave me extra space for souvenirs, and even fully loaded, the padded straps distributed weight well enough that my shoulders didn't hate me.

**The downside?** The water bottle pockets don't stretch much. My standard 32oz bottle didn't fit, though an 18oz worked fine. Also, the zippers felt slightly flimsy when packed to the brim—I had to use both hands to zip it closed.

**Best for:** Budget travelers who want maximum organization without spending a fortune. Perfect for 2-4 day trips.

# 2. Osprey Daylite Plus — The Clever Design ($85)

Here's what makes the Osprey different: instead of a traditional sleeve, the top handle doubles as your luggage pass-through. Genius, right?

I used this on a Lisbon trip, and it handled airport chaos like a champ. Super lightweight (you barely notice it), fits under any airplane seat, and the back panel is surprisingly breathable—even in warm weather, no sweat patches.

The stretchy side pockets actually fit large water bottles (rare!), and there's a quick-access front pocket perfect for headphones or boarding passes.

Inside, you get a laptop sleeve and organizational compartments, though it's more minimalist than the MATEIN. The compression straps let you cinch it down when it's not full, which is handy.

**The reality check?** It's one big main compartment without a ton of internal organization. If you're the type who needs a pocket for everything, this might frustrate you. And at 20-26L capacity (depending on model), it's more day-pack sized than full carry-on.

**Best for:** Minimalist travelers who value quality and durability. Perfect for day trips or as a personal item on flights.

# 3. Timbuk2 Division — The Comfortable Workhorse ($109)

If comfort is your priority, this is it. The shoulder straps and back panel have this patterned foam cushioning that feels like...soft bubble wrap? Hard to describe, but my shoulders approved.

At 18 liters, it's specifically designed to meet personal item size requirements for most airlines. The rear laptop compartment, side water bottle holder, and organizational pockets make grabbing in-flight essentials effortless.

I appreciated how the main compartment was roomier than expected. I fit a toiletries kit, jacket, and neck pillow alongside my usual stuff. The trolley strap is sturdy—held tight to my roller bag even during airport sprints.

**The catch?** It's on the smaller side. For weekend trips where I'm checking a bag, it's perfect. For longer trips as my only carry-on? Too small. And the sleek design means fewer external attachment points for things like carabiners.

**Best for:** Business travelers and frequent flyers who want a reliable personal item that doesn't sacrifice comfort.

# 4. Pacsafe Go Anti-Theft — Peace of Mind ($140)

Traveling through crowded European train stations and sketchy hostels? This one's built for that.

The anti-theft features include lockable zippers, slash-proof fabric, and an RFID-blocking pocket for passports and credit cards. The hidden compartment against the back panel kept my valuables secure in places where I'd normally be paranoid.

The trolley sleeve works smoothly, and there's a padded laptop sleeve plus quick-access side pockets. Once I reached my destination, it functioned great as a daypack—compact enough to not scream ""tourist.""

**The tradeoff?** All those security features add weight and bulk. It's noticeably heavier than the Osprey, even when empty. And the anti-theft fabric has a slightly stiffer feel—durable, but not as flexible as standard backpacks.

**Best for:** Solo travelers in high-pickpocket areas, anyone carrying expensive tech, or travelers who just sleep better knowing their stuff is secure.

# 5. Calpak Luka — Style Meets Function ($88)

Sometimes you want a backpack that doesn't look like you're about to summit Everest.

The Luka is lightweight, sporty, and actually stylish. I'd carry this to a coffee shop without feeling like I'm cosplaying as a hiker. The laptop compartment fits up to 15.6"", there's decent organization inside, and the trolley sleeve does its job without fuss.

The exterior is water-resistant (tested in a Seattle rainstorm—stuff stayed dry), and the back panel has enough padding for all-day comfort.

**The honest part?** It's more fashion-forward than feature-packed. If you need 20 pockets and maximum organization, look elsewhere. This is for travelers who want something that works well AND looks good in Instagram photos.

**Best for:** Digital nomads, city travelers, and anyone who refuses to sacrifice style for functionality.

# 6. BAGSMART Blast — The Practical Favorite ($48)

After testing countless backpacks, this is the one I keep recommending to friends.

The exterior top pocket is ridiculously spacious—it held all my in-flight essentials without bulging. Separate laptop (15.6"") and tablet compartments kept my tech organized and protected.

The clamshell opening made packing like loading a suitcase instead of a black hole. And those multiple pockets? Actually useful. I never scrambled for my charger or toiletries.

The trolley sleeve handled my rolling bag without drama, and the overall design just...works. Nothing fancy, no gimmicks, just solid functionality.

**The downside?** It's not winning any design awards. It's practical, not pretty. And while the material is durable, it's not as premium-feeling as the Tumi or Calpak options.

**Best for:** Practical travelers who value organization and functionality over brand names. Perfect for 2-5 day trips.

# 7. Away Everyday Backpack — Premium Packable ($99)

This 18L backpack packs into its own zipper pocket, which is wild. It weighs 0.5 pounds.

Made from recycled materials, it accommodates a 13"" laptop, has Airmesh-backed straps for comfort, and includes a discreet trolley sleeve. The front webbing lets you attach a water bottle with a carabiner.

I loved it as a packable daypack that I could throw in my suitcase, then pull out at my destination for exploring.

**The reality?** It's pretty minimalist. No massive organizational system, no rigid structure. It's designed to be lightweight and packable first, feature-rich second. And the 13"" laptop limit might be a dealbreaker if you have a larger device.

**Best for:** Minimalist packers who want a secondary backpack that barely takes up space when not in use.

>✈️ **Quick note:** Before we jump into individual recommendations, you can see all the backpacks (plus a few bonus models) in my [**Backpack Comparison Spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16n-yjeyMhoZ3Jeut6NOWVY29Uz9RLUJROgv22E8POrI/).  
It’s a sortable Google Sheet with filters for **capacity, price range, USB type, and rating** — perfect if you want to skim through all the options at once.

# What to Actually Look For

After all this testing, here's what matters:

**Sleeve fit**: Pack your backpack completely full, then test the sleeve. Many work great when empty but become too tight when stuffed. Your suitcase handle should slide through with minor resistance, not require force.

**Capacity sweet spot**: For personal items, 18-25L works. For carry-on use, aim for 30-40L. Bigger isn't always better—you want it full enough to hold shape but not so big it exceeds airline limits.

**Clamshell vs. top-loading**: Clamshell openings (unzip like a suitcase) make packing infinitely easier. Top-loading works for day trips but becomes annoying on longer journeys.

**Padding placement**: Your shoulders and back will thank you. Check that straps are wide and cushioned, and the back panel has airflow channels.

**Quick-access pockets**: You'll reach for your passport, boarding pass, and phone constantly. External pockets save you from unzipping the main compartment every five minutes.

# The One That's Actually in My Closet

After testing all these, I keep reaching for the BAGSMART Blast for weekend trips and the Osprey Daylite Plus for day exploring. The MATEIN sits in my gear closet as my budget backup that I lend to friends, and the Pacsafe comes out when I'm heading somewhere sketchy.

Here's the thing: the best travel backpack with a luggage sleeve isn't about finding the perfect one. It's about finding the one that matches how YOU travel. Budget constraints? Specific security needs? Style preferences? All valid deciding factors.

The trolley sleeve is just the baseline feature. The rest—organization, comfort, durability—that's where you find the backpack that actually works for your trips.

**What's your biggest backpack frustration when traveling? Drop a comment—I'm always curious what features actually matter to real travelers versus what brands think we need.**",1,1761290111.0,PackAndGo,0,1.0,False

I spend my TV time jumping from US sports to UK dramas, Canadian news, and EU music channels—so I need a service that’s as all-over-the-map as my taste. Here’s how my search for the perfect **iptv subscription 2025** played out.



1. [**IPTVMEEZZY\~**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestIPTV_MEEZZY/wiki/index/)

* **Price:** $16/month (slightly less if you grab a yearly plan)
* **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (solid coverage: US, UK, CA, EU and beyond)
* **Smoothness:** 9/10 (streams are impressively reliable—even when I have US football on in the living room and UK reality shows running in the kitchen)
* **Firestick Experience:** Setup was painless on my **iptv firestick**, which is a big relief for someone who hates fiddling with tech.
* **My experience:** I found this one after a friend from the UK (who works as an **iptv reseller**) mentioned their **free trial**. I put it through its paces with everything from Canadian hockey to random Italian news. The interface is simple, and I rarely ran into buffering—even during big live events.



# 2. NovaStream TV

* **Price:** $15/month
* **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 120,000+ VOD (focus on US/UK/CA, with a decent EU selection)
* **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (very stable, with only the odd blip during peak US sports hours)
* **Firestick Experience:** Works out-of-the-box with my **iptv firestick**.
* **My experience:** NovaStream TV was an unexpected favorite. The EPG is well-organized, making it easy to browse UK soaps or catch up on US news. There was a slight lag during a huge CA hockey game, but overall, it was smooth sailing.



# 3. EuroSky IPTV

* **Price:** $14/month
* **Channels:** 30,000+ live, 100,000+ VOD (big focus on EU and UK, plus all the main US and CA channels)
* **Smoothness:** 8/10 (streams are clear most of the time, but European sports finals can cause a hiccup)
* **Firestick Experience:** Runs well on my **iptv firestick**, no extra steps needed.
* **My experience:** EuroSky IPTV is where I go when I’m in the mood for EU documentaries or late-night UK panel shows. The VOD library has a lot of hidden gems, and most streams load quickly, though I did notice a little buffering during the last EU football final.



# 4. MapleView Streams

* **Price:** $13/month
* **Channels:** 22,000+ live, 60,000+ VOD (strong on CA/US, decent UK/EU offering)
* **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (great for everyday viewing, but big live events can slow it down)
* **Firestick Experience:** No issues on the **iptv firestick**.
* **My experience:** MapleView Streams is my choice for mornings—perfect for Canadian news or US talk shows while I wake up. The EU content is there if you look, and their **free trial** helped me figure out if it fit my routine.



# 5. UrbanPulse IPTV

* **Price:** $12/month
* **Channels:** 17,000+ live, 45,000+ VOD (covers the basics in US, UK, CA, and top EU picks)
* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (fine for regular use, but not my go-to for live international sports)
* **Firestick Experience:** Worked well once I installed their recommended app on my **iptv firestick**.
* **My experience:** UrbanPulse IPTV isn’t flashy, but it’s reliable for chill evenings with UK comedies or US sitcoms. Their **iptv reseller** portal looked simple, but I’m more about watching than selling.



# Some IPTV Thoughts After a Year of Testing

* **Always take the free trial**—what looks great on paper might not fit your actual habits or devices.
* Even **top rated iptv** services can get bogged down during huge live events, especially in the EU or US.
* Channel numbers are fun, but I mostly rotate between a handful of favorites.
* Using an **iptv firestick** makes life easier if you hate tech headaches.
* If you’re considering being an **iptv reseller**, be ready for lots of questions from friends and family!

No matter where you are—US, UK, CA, EU—finding the right **iptv subscription 2025** comes down to what you like to watch and how patient you are with occasional tech hiccups. I’m always curious to hear about new hidden gems, so if you have one, let me know.

1oer41t,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oer41t/shell_never_know_i_love_her/,She’ll never know I love her,"So, there’s this girl in the office who works at a cafe I go to often. We never really talked beyond the usual small interactions she’d take my order, smile, and that was it. Over time, I started to really like her. There was something about her that just felt special to me. She has that amazing energy with great personality I always dreamed in a girl.

For about a month, I saw her almost every day. I started having small conversations with her and even got to know a few of her coworkers. It became part of my routine getting my coffee, chatting a bit, and walking out to have a smoke.

At my workplace, we’re only allowed one coffee per day after badging in. But her coworkers were always kind and sometimes gave me a second one for free. One day, when I went to get the second coffee I offered to pay and she smiled, took off her badge, and said, You can use mine. That’s actually how I found out her name after a whole month.

Finally, next day decided to take a chance. I gave her a small chocolate bar with a note asking if she’d like to grab coffee sometime, and I added my number. A few hours later, she texted me back she said she really appreciated it but that she’s in a relationship. She was kind about it, and I respected that.

After that, I still went to the cafe for about a week. We interacted normally nothing awkward, just small smiles and casual exchanges. But at some point, I decided to start avoiding the place because it was hard seeing her everyday and I thought it would help me move on.

I tried distracting myself went out with friends, hit a few bars and clubs, tried to meet new people. It didn’t help. No matter what I do, she still crosses my mind. Even when I’m busy at work, she randomly shows up in my thoughts like a quiet echo I can’t turn off.

It’s strange how someone you barely know can have such an effect on you. I know nothing’s going to happen, and I’ve accepted that. But the hardest part is, I’ll still have to see her every day and she’ll never know I have true feelings for her.

Sometimes, I wish I’d never met her because loving someone quietly like this hurts more than I expected.",1,1761289895.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1oer1pf,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1oer1pf/how_to_get_a_new_zealand_ip_address_with_a_nordvpn/,How to Get a New Zealand IP Address With a NordVPN,"Picture this: You're traveling abroad or living as an expat, and suddenly you can't access your ANZ bank account, watch the latest episode of The Block NZ on ThreeNow, or file your taxes through IRD. Your favorite Kiwi content and essential services are locked behind geo-restrictions, and your bank flags your login attempts as suspicious simply because you're connecting from a foreign IP address.

This frustrating scenario affects thousands of New Zealanders living or traveling overseas, along with international users who need access to New Zealand-specific content and services. With **cybersecurity breaches in New Zealand increasing by 8% in 2025** according to recent industry reports, securing your online access while bypassing geo-restrictions has never been more critical.

The solution? A reliable VPN with servers in New Zealand. NordVPN stands out as the leading choice, offering **20+ high-speed servers in Auckland** and robust security features that keep your data protected while giving you seamless access to everything New Zealand has to offer.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through exactly how to get a New Zealand IP address using NordVPN, explore why you might need one, and share expert tips to optimize your experience.

# Why You Need a New Zealand IP Address

Before diving into the how-to, let's understand why obtaining a New Zealand IP address matters for security, access, and convenience.

# Stream Your Favorite Kiwi Content

New Zealand's streaming landscape offers exceptional content that's unfortunately locked to local IP addresses. **TVNZ+** (formerly TVNZ OnDemand) provides free access to popular shows like Taskmaster NZ, The Brokenwood Mysteries, and Australian Survivor, while **ThreeNow** features content from Three, Bravo, HGTV, and more—including Married at First Sight and Below Deck Mediterranean.

Following Sky's acquisition of Three and ThreeNow in August 2025, the streaming ecosystem has become even more robust, offering New Zealanders both free and premium content options. However, these platforms strictly enforce geo-restrictions, blocking access from foreign IP addresses.

According to testing by multiple independent reviewers, NordVPN successfully unblocks all major New Zealand streaming services, maintaining fast connection speeds that support HD and 4K streaming without buffering.

# Access Banking and Financial Services Securely

New Zealand's major banks—including **ANZ, ASB, BNZ, Westpac, and Kiwibank**—implement sophisticated fraud detection systems that flag foreign IP addresses as potential security threats. While these measures protect against fraud, they create significant challenges for legitimate users accessing accounts from overseas.

Banks may temporarily lock your account, require additional verification steps, or even block access entirely when detecting international login attempts. By connecting to a New Zealand server through NordVPN, you maintain a local IP address that allows seamless, secure access to your financial services without triggering security alerts.

**Security note:** Always use a reputable VPN like NordVPN when accessing banking services on public Wi-Fi networks. The combination of **AES-256 encryption** and a New Zealand IP address provides both security and accessibility.

# Maintain Government Service Access

Expats and travelers frequently need access to New Zealand government services that verify location through IP addresses:

* **IRD (Inland Revenue Department):** File tax returns and access tax information
* **Immigration New Zealand:** Check visa status and submit applications
* **RealMe:** New Zealand's secure online identity verification system
* **Ministry of Social Development:** Access benefits and support services

These services often restrict access to New Zealand IP addresses for security and compliance reasons. NordVPN's Auckland servers provide the local presence necessary to maintain access to these critical services from anywhere in the world.

# Enhanced Online Privacy in the Five Eyes Era

New Zealand is a member of the **Five Eyes intelligence alliance**, alongside the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. While New Zealand maintains strong privacy protections through the **Privacy Act 2020**, awareness of surveillance practices has increased privacy concerns among digitally-conscious Kiwis.

The **National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)** reported that New Zealanders experienced over **830,000 instances of financial loss** from online threats in Q1 2025, highlighting the importance of robust online security measures. NordVPN's strict no-logs policy, independently audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, ensures that even if data is requested, there's nothing to hand over.

# How to Get a New Zealand IP Address With NordVPN: Step-by-Step Guide

Getting started with NordVPN is straightforward. Follow these steps to obtain your New Zealand IP address and start accessing local content within minutes.

# Step 1: Subscribe to NordVPN

Visit NordVPN's official website and choose a subscription plan that fits your needs:

* **Basic Plan:** $3.09/month (2-year commitment) — Includes all core VPN features
* **Plus Plan:** $3.99/month (2-year commitment) — Adds Threat Protection Pro and NordPass password manager
* **Complete Plan:** $4.99/month (2-year commitment) — Includes 1TB encrypted cloud storage via NordLocker

All plans include the same VPN functionality with access to all New Zealand servers. The difference lies in additional security tools. For most users, the **Plus plan offers the best value**, combining essential VPN features with advanced malware protection.

NordVPN offers a **30-day money-back guarantee** on all plans, allowing you to test the service risk-free. This means you can try it specifically for New Zealand access and request a full refund if it doesn't meet your expectations.

# Step 2: Download and Install NordVPN

After subscribing, download the NordVPN app for your device:

* **Desktop:** Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux
* **Mobile:** Apps for iOS and Android devices
* **Other devices:** Smart TV apps, browser extensions (Chrome, Firefox, Edge), and router configuration options

NordVPN supports **10 simultaneous device connections** on a single account, meaning you can protect your laptop, smartphone, tablet, and smart TV all at once—perfect for families or users with multiple devices.

Installation takes just a few minutes. Download the app from NordVPN's website or your device's app store, run the installer, and log in with your account credentials.

# Step 3: Connect to a New Zealand Server

Once installed, obtaining a New Zealand IP address is simple:

1. **Open the NordVPN app** on your device
2. **Click the search bar** or scroll through the server list
3. **Select ""New Zealand""** from the country list—you'll see 20+ available servers
4. **Click ""Connect""** or tap the Quick Connect button

For optimal performance, NordVPN's smart algorithm automatically selects the fastest available server in Auckland. However, you can manually choose specific servers if you prefer.

**Pro tip:** If you need a New Zealand IP address regularly, add New Zealand to your favorites list for one-click access in future sessions.

# Step 4: Verify Your New Zealand IP Address

After connecting, confirm your new IP address:

1. **Check the NordVPN app** — Look for the green ""Connected"" status with ""New Zealand"" displayed
2. **Visit a geolocation website** like WhatIsMyIP.com or IPLocation.net
3. **Verify the location shows** Auckland or New Zealand
4. **Test with a New Zealand service** like TVNZ+ to confirm access

The entire connection process typically takes 5-10 seconds. NordVPN's **NordLynx protocol** (based on WireGuard) ensures fast, stable connections with minimal latency.

# Step 5: Access New Zealand Content and Services

With your New Zealand IP address active, you can now:

* Stream content on **TVNZ+, ThreeNow, Sky, and Neon**
* Access your **banking portals** without security flags
* Use **government services** like IRD and RealMe
* Shop on **New Zealand e-commerce sites** with local pricing
* Access **NZ-specific social media content** and news sites

Keep NordVPN running in the background to maintain your New Zealand IP address throughout your browsing session.

# What Makes NordVPN Ideal for New Zealand

With numerous VPN providers in the market, why does NordVPN stand out for New Zealand users? Several key factors make it the optimal choice.

# Extensive Server Network in Auckland

NordVPN maintains **over 20 dedicated servers in Auckland**, providing multiple connection options and reducing server congestion. This extensive local presence ensures:

* **Fast connection speeds** — Multiple servers mean less overcrowding
* **Reliable access** — If one server experiences issues, others remain available
* **Consistent availability** — Server maintenance doesn't interrupt your access

Independent speed tests conducted in 2025 show NordVPN delivering **83-133 Mbps download speeds** on 100 Mbps connections when connected to New Zealand servers—representing only a 15-20% speed reduction, which is exceptional for VPN performance.

Beyond New Zealand, NordVPN's global network spans **8,200+ servers across 118 countries**, making it equally useful for accessing content from other regions when needed.

# Military-Grade Security Features

Security forms the foundation of any quality VPN service. NordVPN implements industry-leading protection measures:

**AES-256 Encryption:** The same encryption standard trusted by governments, banks, and military organizations worldwide. This level of encryption is computationally infeasible to crack, ensuring your data remains private even if intercepted.

**NordLynx Protocol:** Built on the revolutionary WireGuard VPN protocol, NordLynx combines exceptional speed with robust security. It uses modern cryptography and a streamlined codebase that's easier to audit for vulnerabilities compared to older protocols.

**Automatic Kill Switch:** If your VPN connection drops unexpectedly, the kill switch immediately blocks all internet traffic, preventing accidental data exposure. This feature is crucial when accessing sensitive services like banking.

**Threat Protection Pro:** Available on Plus and higher plans, this advanced feature blocks malicious websites, prevents trackers from following you online, and scans downloaded files for malware—addressing the rising cyber threats facing New Zealand users in 2025.

**No-Logs Policy:** NordVPN maintains a strict no-logs policy, independently audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers. This means no browsing history, connection timestamps, or IP addresses are stored—even NordVPN can't see what you're doing online.

# Lightning-Fast Speeds for Streaming and More

Speed matters when streaming high-definition content or conducting video calls. NordVPN consistently ranks among the fastest VPN services available:

* **Average speeds of 85+ Mbps** on New Zealand servers
* **4K streaming support** without buffering
* **Low latency** for video calls and online gaming
* **Unlimited bandwidth** for unrestricted use

Multiple independent reviewers note that NordVPN's New Zealand servers easily handle HD streaming on platforms like TVNZ+ and ThreeNow, with minimal loading times and no interruptions during peak usage hours.

# Optimized for New Zealand Streaming Services

Unlike some VPN providers that struggle with geo-blocking detection, NordVPN actively maintains access to New Zealand streaming platforms:

* **TVNZ+:** Confirmed working with instant access
* **ThreeNow:** Successfully bypasses geo-restrictions
* **Sky Sport Now:** Access sports content from abroad
* **Neon:** Stream premium shows and movies

NordVPN's **SmartPlay technology** combines VPN and Smart DNS capabilities, automatically routing streaming traffic through optimized servers for the best performance.

# Understanding NordVPN Pricing and Value

NordVPN offers flexible pricing options designed to accommodate different budgets and needs. Understanding the cost structure helps you choose the most suitable plan.

# Current Pricing Structure (October 2025)

* 2-year plan: **$3.09/month** ($83.43 total)
* 1-year plan: **$4.99/month** ($59.88 total)

# Value Analysis for New Zealand Users

For users primarily seeking New Zealand IP access for streaming and banking, the **Basic plan provides excellent value at just $3.09/month** with a 2-year commitment. This represents significant savings compared to upgrading streaming services to premium tiers or purchasing multiple security tools separately.

The **Plus plan, at $3.99/month for 2 years, offers compelling value** for security-conscious users. Threat Protection Pro alone typically costs $2-3/month as a standalone service, making the additional 90 cents per month worthwhile for comprehensive protection against the rising cyber threats facing New Zealand users.

# Risk-Free Trial Period

Every NordVPN plan includes a **30-day money-back guarantee**, providing a full month to test the service specifically for New Zealand access. This guarantee is honored without questions, allowing you to:

* Test connection speeds to Auckland servers
* Verify access to your required New Zealand services
* Evaluate streaming quality on TVNZ+ and ThreeNow
* Ensure banking access works smoothly

Simply contact NordVPN's 24/7 customer support to request a refund within 30 days if the service doesn't meet your needs.

# Common Issues and Troubleshooting

While NordVPN generally provides smooth operation, occasionally you might encounter challenges. Here's how to resolve the most common issues.

# Connection Problems to New Zealand Servers

**Symptom:** Unable to connect to New Zealand servers or frequent disconnections.

**Solutions:**

* **Switch servers:** If one Auckland server isn't working, manually select a different New Zealand server
* **Change protocols:** Try switching between NordLynx, OpenVPN (UDP), and OpenVPN (TCP) in settings
* **Disable firewall temporarily:** Some firewalls interfere with VPN connections; temporarily disable to test
* **Restart the app:** Close NordVPN completely and reopen it
* **Update the app:** Ensure you're running the latest version with bug fixes

# Slow Connection Speeds

**Symptom:** Unusually slow speeds when connected to New Zealand servers.

**Solutions:**

* **Use NordLynx protocol:** This is NordVPN's fastest protocol—enable it in settings
* **Connect to the nearest server:** If you're in Asia-Pacific, New Zealand servers should be fast; if you're in Europe or the Americas, expect some speed reduction due to distance
* **Close bandwidth-heavy apps:** Ensure other applications aren't consuming bandwidth
* **Check your base internet speed:** Test your connection without VPN to establish a baseline
* **Try off-peak hours:** Server congestion during peak usage times can affect speeds

# Banking or Financial Service Access Issues

**Symptom:** Bank still flagging your login or blocking access despite using NordVPN.

**Solutions:**

* **Clear browser cookies:** Banks sometimes recognize your device through cookies; clear them before logging in
* **Use incognito/private browsing:** This prevents cookie tracking
* **Disable WebRTC:** WebRTC can leak your real IP address; disable it in browser settings or use NordVPN's browser extension
* **Contact your bank:** Some banks require notification before international travel; inform them you'll be accessing from abroad
* **Try different New Zealand servers:** Some banks may have specific server IP ranges whitelisted

# Streaming Service Detection

**Symptom:** TVNZ+ or ThreeNow detects VPN use and blocks access.

**Solutions:**

* **Switch New Zealand servers:** Some streaming services block specific server IPs; try different Auckland servers
* **Clear browser cache:** Cached data might reveal your actual location
* **Disable location services:** Turn off GPS and location services in your device settings
* **Contact NordVPN support:** They can recommend specific servers optimized for streaming
* **Use the NordVPN app (not browser extension):** Full app provides better geo-spoofing

# Staying Secure: Best Practices for New Zealand IP Use

Obtaining a New Zealand IP address is just the first step. Follow these cybersecurity best practices to maximize your protection.

# Enable Critical Security Features

Always keep these NordVPN features enabled:

* **Kill Switch:** Prevents data leaks if VPN disconnects
* **Automatic Connection:** Configure NordVPN to connect automatically when you start your device
* **Threat Protection Pro:** (Plus plan and above) Blocks malicious sites and malware
* **Split Tunneling:** Route banking apps through VPN while keeping other apps direct (if needed)

# Practice Good Password Hygiene

With increased cybersecurity threats in New Zealand (8% rise in breaches in 2025), secure passwords are essential:

* Use **unique passwords** for each online service
* Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** wherever available, especially for banking
* Consider **NordPass** (included with Plus and higher plans) to securely manage passwords
* Regularly update passwords, particularly for financial services

# Be Cautious on Public Wi-Fi

When accessing New Zealand services from abroad, you'll likely use various Wi-Fi networks:

* **Always connect to NordVPN first** before accessing any websites
* Avoid accessing sensitive services on completely unsecured networks
* Verify the Wi-Fi network name with staff before connecting
* Consider using mobile data for critical transactions if Wi-Fi security is questionable

# Keep Software Updated

Cybercriminals exploit outdated software vulnerabilities:

* Regularly update the NordVPN app to the latest version
* Keep your device's operating system current with security patches

# Legal Considerations: VPN Use in New Zealand

Using a VPN in New Zealand is **completely legal**. New Zealand law does not prohibit VPN usage for privacy, security, or accessing content from different regions. However, you should understand a few important points:

# Legitimate Use Cases

VPNs serve many lawful purposes in New Zealand:

* **Privacy protection** from ISP tracking and data collection
* **Security** on public Wi-Fi networks
* **Access to regional content** you have legitimate rights to view
* **Business security** for remote workers accessing company networks
* **Bypassing ISP throttling** for better connection speeds

# Terms of Service Considerations

While VPN use is legal, some services have terms of service that technically prohibit VPN usage:

* **Streaming platforms** like TVNZ+ and ThreeNow operate in a gray area; using a VPN doesn't violate New Zealand law, but it may technically breach their terms of service
* **Banking institutions** generally accept VPN use but may require additional verification
* Most services don't actively enforce anti-VPN policies for users with valid subscriptions

**Practical reality:** Services rarely take action against users accessing content they're entitled to view. The primary concern is protecting copyright geographically, not punishing individual users.

# Illegal Activities Remain Illegal

A VPN does not make illegal activities legal. Using NordVPN to:

* **Download copyrighted content illegally** remains a criminal offense
* **Commit fraud or cybercrimes** violates New Zealand law
* **Access prohibited content** is still illegal regardless of IP location

Use NordVPN responsibly and lawfully to protect your privacy and access content you're entitled to view.

# NordVPN vs. Free VPN Services: Why Quality Matters

You might wonder whether free VPN services could provide New Zealand IP access. While tempting, free VPNs come with significant drawbacks that make NordVPN's modest cost worthwhile.

# Security Risks of Free VPNs

Free VPN providers must monetize somehow, often through methods that compromise your security:

* **Data logging and selling:** Many free VPNs track and sell your browsing data to advertisers
* **Malware injection:** Some free services inject ads or malware into your connection
* **Weak encryption:** Free VPNs often use outdated, easily cracked encryption protocols
* **No accountability:** Free services typically lack independent security audits

In contrast, NordVPN's **independently audited no-logs policy** and **premium AES-256 encryption** ensure your data remains truly private.

# Performance Limitations

Free VPNs impose severe restrictions that make them impractical for New Zealand access:

* **Data caps:** Typically 500MB-10GB per month, insufficient for streaming
* **Speed throttling:** Intentionally slow speeds that make video streaming impossible
* **Server limitations:** Usually no New Zealand servers, or extremely overcrowded ones
* **Unreliable connections:** Frequent disconnections disrupt streaming and banking access

NordVPN provides **unlimited bandwidth** and **20+ dedicated New Zealand servers** with consistently fast speeds.

# Streaming Detection

Major streaming platforms actively block known free VPN IP addresses. Free VPNs rarely work with:

* TVNZ+
* ThreeNow
* Sky Sport Now
* Neon

NordVPN maintains access through **regular server IP rotation** and **SmartPlay technology** specifically designed to bypass geo-restrictions.

# The Value Proposition

At **just $3.09/month** with a 2-year commitment, NordVPN costs less than a single coffee per month while providing:

* Reliable New Zealand IP access
* Military-grade security
* Lightning-fast speeds
* 24/7 customer support
* 30-day money-back guarantee

The peace of mind and consistent performance make the modest investment worthwhile compared to the false economy of free VPNs.

I’m trying to find a mobile game I played around 2017. In the game, you had a house and could buy and take care of cats. You had to clean up after them (for example when they spilled coffee or broke an aquarium). There was also a yard where you could let the cats out, but they wouldn’t go outside when it was raining and you had to close the door.

There was also a mouse you could bait with cheese, and then the cats would try to catch it. I also remember something about cat races. I think the game’s name was something like The Cats or something similar.

I got the game from a friend via Bluetooth on an old phone, so I can’t check any purchase history or old screenshots. I’ve searched everywhere but can’t find it anymore. Does anyone remember this game or know its full name?",1,1761289406.0,tipofmyjoystick,0,1.0,False

Chapter1 

Prologue 

For Old Time’s Sake 

Zinnia’s POV 

“You have the cupcakes?” I asked my grandmother. 

“I have them,” she laughed. “Stop worrying. Your mother’s been driving me nuts trying to get me 

to tell her before the party. She hasn’t changed — even when she was a little girl, I’d catch her 

sneaking into my closet to try to find her Christmas presents.” 

“I’m not sure how I’m going to make it through dinner knowing that once we get to dessert, Dash and I will know if we’re having a boy or a girl.” 

Dash’s hand reached over and squeezed my thigh. 

“You’ll make it just fine,” she said. “Is he in the car with you?” 

“Yeah. He’s driving. He was actually able to get out of the hospital on time for once.” 

“Well, I’ll see you two soon for the big gender reveal,” she said and ended the call. 

\~ 

Everything had come to a screeching halt when I’d stood up so fast that my chair went flying backwards. Not an easy feat for a woman one month from her due date, but the chair was flat on the grass. 

“What is that supposed to mean?” I asked my husband sharply, and everyone around the table and standing around us in the backyard quieted, realizing that the pregnant woman wasn’t laughing. 

“Nothing,” Dash said. “It was a joke.” 

“A joke? You think something like that’s a joke?” 

“Yeah, Zinnie, a joke.” 

“I didn’t think it was very funny to joke about getting my sister pregnant.” 

Chapter1 

1.01% 

“Zinnie —” 

I looked at my sister next. “And I don’t think it was funny that you went along with it and brought up ancient history.” 

Dash and Iris had dated in their senior year of high school and broke up when they went to college. Looking between them, ignoring the uncomfortable silence in the backyard, I had a horrible thought, one that I’d never worried about before, but now, after their comments… 

“Or is it ancient history?” 

There were gasps all around the table, and my mother said my name sharply. 

“Zinnia, you need to stop. It was just a joke.” 

Instead of sitting down or answering her, I turned to Dash. “I want to leave. Now.” 

—— 

“Zinnie, stop being ” he said, his face flushed from anger. 

Stop being what? 

“Now, Dash! I want to leave now.” I looked at my grandmother. “Thank you for making the cupcakes.” 

I walked out of the backyard to the front, not bothering to see if he’d follow. If he didn’t, I had my own set of car keys and I’d leave his ass here. Maybe tell him it was just a joke. Ha, ha, fucking ha. Maybe my sister could give him a ride home, and he could get her pregnant in the backseat of her 

car. 

But he was right behind me, angry, and he let me know that without saying a word by not opening the car door for me like he always did. Not a problem. I slammed his precious car door a little too hard, and although I felt his eyes snap at me, he didn’t say a word. 

The time to have kept his mouth shut would have been after everyone was watching us bite into our cupcakes, waiting in anticipation to see if we were having a boy or a girl. I saw the pink filling and immediately squealed. Honestly, I would have squealed either way — I was just excited knowing what we were having. We’d decided to wait for the gender reveal until everyone on both sides could make it**,** which is why we were only finding out a month before I was due. 

Seeing that pink filling, I turned to Dash, only to see him with an odd look on his face — disappointment? In fact, everyone around the table was quiet and no one seemed excited except

**ME** 

for my grandmother. 

“We’re having a girl!” I enthused, although it sounded awkward. I wondered if that would shake 

him out of his funk. 

“Yeah,” he said, and now the disappointment wasn’t just on his face but in his voice, too. He’d put the cupcake down and pushed the plate away as if it offended him. 

My mother stepped in. “Well, if at first you don’t get it right, try, try again.” 

Get it right? What? Who said that at a gender reveal? 

Dash gave a half smile at my mother, then he looked at my sister and grinned. “Why wait another two–and–a–half months? I’ll just get Iris pregnant.” 

Unbelievably, all my relatives roared at that. They couldn’t rejoice in a little girl, but they could 

laugh uproariously at a horrible, tactless comment. For a minute, I hoped I’d been adopted so I 

wasn’t related by blood to these people, but then I was distracted by the feeling that my stomach was going to revolt. 

“I’m game,” Iris joined in. “Ready when you are, Dash! For old time’s sake.” 

Then she puckered her lips and made a kissy sound at him. 

She’d actually brought up the time when she and Dash had dated almost fifteen years ago? What was going on here? 

That was when I’d stood up abruptly and sent my chair flying. 

Part 2– 

An Open Invitation 

Zinnia’s POV 

I didn’t say a word to my husband all the way home, even though once we pulled out of the driveway, he decided to talk to me**.** Inside my head, however, was a different story. 

“You’re overreacting,” he kept saying when I refused to say a word. “Zinnie, it was a joke.” 

You’re supposed to laugh *if* it’s a joke. 

“I wouldn’t actually try to get your sister pregnant.” 

Chart2-1 

You *used to* date her. *You saying you’d try to* get a *boy* with her means *you’re* unhappy we’re *having* a *girl*. *And talking* about cheating on me with my *sister?* So *nasty*. So inappropriate. 

“Everyone but you took it as a joke.” 

It *still doesn’t* mean *it* was an appropriate joke to make. *It* was completely *gross*. 

He gave up trying to talk with me after he told me he didn’t know why I was so upset about a joke. 

I couldn’t bear the thought of sleeping next to him, so I got ready for bed in the guest bathroom 

and went to the tiny third bedroom where we had a full size bed. Exhaustion hit me as he followed 

me into the room. 

“You’re taking this too far,” he accused me. Me! 

Pulling back the covers, I lay on my left side, my back to him. 

“Come sleep in our bed,” he tried coaxing me. “You’re spiraling out of control for what was 

nothing more than a joke. Do you honestly think I’d sleep with your sister?” 

“I don’t know what to think anymore,” I said in reply to that opening he gave me. “Thanks to 

your so–called joke, I’m now thinking you may be cheating on me with my sister or at the least thinking about it or her since you’re talking about getting her pregnant. I now know you’re disappointed we’re having a girl. I now have to wonder if you never really got over my sister and you married me *to* stay close to her. I now know neither of you gives a damn about my feelings since you sided together against me to make the joke.” 

“Do you hear yourself, Zinnie? All that from a motherfucking joke? Not sure when you lost your sense of humor, but I’m not going to keep trying to defend myself when you’re the only one who didn’t get the joke.*”* 

*Keep* fighting your *corner*. I *just told you how I felt*, and *you’re dismissing* what I said and *everything* I *felt*. 

In case I missed it from the exasperation in his voice, he slammed the door to the bedroom to let me know how displeased he was. Since I couldn’t sleep, I rested my body but my mind was getting 

a workout. 

I was married to a man who thought it was funny to share his disappointment that our baby was a girl, a disappointment that I never knew about. 

Chapter1 

1.01% 

I was married to a man who thought joking about cheating on me with my sister, who was his ex, was a joke. My own sister thought it was funny to go along with it and ask if he wanted to get started after dinner. I was the spawn of two people who chastised me for getting mad at my husband and sister for making such a horrible, tasteless joke. 

Maybe it was the hormones but I remembered another so–called joke, this time made by Dash’s very drunk father, at our rehearsal dinner. 

“*We’re* glad the two of you have found happiness in *your own way*. We never *thought* he’d *get over* his *first* love, but hey! Even *if* he didn’t*,* you’re the one he’s marrying so that’s just about *first* place!” 

While everyone was laughing, I’d gotten up from the table and walked away, knowing Dash’s first love was my sister. Dash had hurried after me, apologizing for what his father said, but then he’d told me it was just a joke, and I needed to come back in so I didn’t ruin the evening and make his dad feel bad. Since the wedding was so close, because I didn’t want there to be strained relations at our wedding, I went back and made amends. 

Now, I was tired of jokes. I was tired of being told I was the one with the problem. I was tired of having to swallow down so–called jokes to keep the peace. I should have walked away after that rehearsal dinner and not married Dash. Then I wouldn’t be in this situation right now. 

No, I was the peacemaker, the one who put up with shit so I wouldn’t rock the boat. So no one would feel uncomfortable. So everyone would be happy. So someone else — namely Iris — could shine with her more outgoing, demanding personality. 

It wasn’t OK when it just me but I’d allowed it like a chump since I never wanted to make waves. Now, however, I was thinking about my daughter – apparently, I was the only one who wanted her – and what my lack of a spine would teach her. No lesson I wanted her to learn. 

Think, Zinnia. What if she came to me and told me this, that her husband had made a terrible joke about impregnating her sister? 

“I’d tell her to stop taking it and leave him until he could change his attitude and see why it was wrong,” I whispered out loud in the darkness. 

A whisper in the dark can be more powerful than a shout in the daylight. 

Where could I go? Not to my parents. Not to my sister. I was going no contact for a while with them. I was one month from my due date, and since I worked from home as a medical Chapter1 

1.01% 

transcriptionist, I was portable. I could work anywhere. I suddenly realized where I could go if my husband wouldn’t leave our home. 

The next morning, I was sitting at the kitchen table with my morning tea. I’d never been much of a coffee drinker, which my husband couldn’t understand. He came into the kitchen about half an 

hour later, ready for work, tie straight, the young doctor ready to see patients. 

He immediately spied his phone on the table. 

“I took it while you were in the shower,” I explained. 

Yeah, I figured that I’d admit it right up front, and I didn’t even care if it was wrong. If he was going to make jokes about impregnating his former girlfriend and then try to minimize how much 

it had hurt me by saying it was a joke, I was going to search for answers on my own. 

“Unfortunately, I couldn’t get into it since you changed your passcode.” 

“Why are you trying to go through my phone?” 

“Why wouldn’t I be able to go through your phone, Dash?” 

“You’d have a fit **if I** tried to go through your phone.” 

Avoid. Deflect. Not helping to reassure me. 

“No, I wouldn’t because I have nothing to hide.” I pushed my phone across the table to him. “You know the passcode. I haven’t felt the need to change it.” 

“This is bullshit.” 

“Open your phone and let me see your texts.” 

“No. It’s the principle of the thing. I’m not letting you see my texts.” 

As I’d expected. Still a blow, but not altogether surprising. People only protected their phones when they had something to hide. 

“I wanted to talk last night over with you. See if you’d realize how awful your so–called joke was and give you a chance to apologize.” 

“You’re the one that blew up at Iris and me, Zinnie. You’re the one that couldn’t take a damn joke and ruined the night for everyone.”

He was making it sound like he and Iris were the couple, like they were an entity and I was the 

outsider. 

“So, basically, to summarize, you’re telling me no self–reflection went on and you’re making this your hill to die on,” I said because I wanted this stated out loud. 

“I’m saying it was nothing to get upset about, but I’m trying to be patient and keep your 

condition in mind.” 

“You’re ignoring that I was upset. Extremely upset and I’ve already told you the reasons why. But your entire reaction to my feelings being hurt was to tell me I couldn’t take a joke.” 

“Because it was a joke! Why can’t you just let this go? It’s not that serious.” 

“It was to me,” and I hated that my voice still sounded small. No wonder no one took me 

seriously. 

“You’re going to laugh about this after the baby comes and your sense of humor returns.‘ 

“No, I won’t ever laugh about what was said last night. Even if you didn’t take time to think last night after we got home, *I* did. I did a lot of thinking, and I realized I want some space, Dash.” 

“Is it the pregnancy that’s making you act like this? What does that mean, you want space?” 

“Exactly what it sounds like. I want you to move out for a while. Go home to your parents. Go stay with my sister and use this time to impregnate her with the boy you clearly want. I don’t even care right now. All I know is I don’t want to be around you.” 

I can’t be around you. That’s how mad you 

made me, 

“Now you want us to separate? Zinnie, that is not a normal response to what was nothing more than a joke. I want you to call your doctor today, get in to see her immediately and see if there’s something off in your bloodwork because the Zinnia I know would never act like this.” 

“No, you wouldn’t know this version of me because I always accepted whatever was thrown at me to keep the peace, but last night I realized that’s not the example I want to set for my daughter – you know, the baby you’re disappointed is a girl? I want her to stand up for herself and say no. So I need to do that for her sake.” 

Dash glanced at his watch. 

“I’m not moving out, so get that out of your head. We’ll talk more tonight if you really feel that 

Chapter1

strongly about it. I have to get going to make my shift.” 

He leaned down to kiss me, but I reared back so his lips didn’t connect with mine, and he sighed as 

if I was the problem. 

“Is that your final decision about not moving out?” I asked. 

“Yeah. I’m not moving out of my own home because you suddenly lost your sense of humor about a lighthearted joke. That’s way over the top, Zinnie.” 

“I needed you to care about how I felt over this, Dash,” I said, resigned. 

“If it was something serious, I would have cared, Zin. But this is you getting bent out of shape about a joke.” 

If I had any reservations about my course of action, that parting shot from Dash wiped them away. 

He must have made some calls on the way to the hospital because both my mother and Iris called me multiple times. I didn’t pick up because I was too busy packing, which meant they started texting me. The fact that he felt like it was a good idea to call my sister and my mother didn’t help his cause, and it just made me angrier. As a person who was used to pushing her anger aside, that bubbling, boiling sensation I was feeling inside felt good. Strong. 

If Dash wouldn’t leave, then I would because I hadn’t been kidding when I said I needed space. 

Maybe I was overreacting. Maybe my response was extreme. But maybe all my years of underreacting in the past had come to a boiling point and this joke suddenly and without warning became my line in the sand. I needed to think this through calmly and since I couldn’t be calm around my husband, I wouldn’t be able to think. 

Putting three small carry–on suitcases in the trunk, I headed out to the only person in the world who might have my back, and I didn’t even know her all that well but instinctively trusted her. She was my great aunt – my paternal grandmother’s sister. She lived on a commune, and I’d met Aggie several times growing up, liking her hippie vibe and direct attitude. My grandmother had taken me for a week every summer, but Iris and my parents never joined us because Mom and Dad thought communes were places where hippies lived to avoid being productive members of society. They never wanted to hear when I tried to explain what the commune was actually like. 

The last time I’d seen Aggie had been when I was fourteen, at my grandmother’s funeral. She’d been killed in a car accident, and Aggie had come for her service. A quiet woman, Aggie had been reserved with my parents and sister, but she gave me a hug and told me I was welcome to come

Chapter1 

Prologue 

For Old Time’s Sake 

Zinnia’s POV 

“You have the cupcakes?” I asked my grandmother. 

“I have them,” she laughed. “Stop worrying. Your mother’s been driving me nuts trying to get me 

to tell her before the party. She hasn’t changed — even when she was a little girl, I’d catch her 

sneaking into my closet to try to find her Christmas presents.” 

“I’m not sure how I’m going to make it through dinner knowing that once we get to dessert, Dash and I will know if we’re having a boy or a girl.” 

Dash’s hand reached over and squeezed my thigh. 

“You’ll make it just fine,” she said. “Is he in the car with you?” 

“Yeah. He’s driving. He was actually able to get out of the hospital on time for once.” 

“Well, I’ll see you two soon for the big gender reveal,” she said and ended the call. 

\~ 

Everything had come to a screeching halt when I’d stood up so fast that my chair went flying backwards. Not an easy feat for a woman one month from her due date, but the chair was flat on the grass. 

“What is that supposed to mean?” I asked my husband sharply, and everyone around the table and standing around us in the backyard quieted, realizing that the pregnant woman wasn’t laughing. 

“Nothing,” Dash said. “It was a joke.” 

“A joke? You think something like that’s a joke?” 

“Yeah, Zinnie, a joke.” 

“I didn’t think it was very funny to joke about getting my sister pregnant.” 

Chapter1 

1.01% 

“Zinnie —” 

I looked at my sister next. “And I don’t think it was funny that you went along with it and brought up ancient history.” 

Dash and Iris had dated in their senior year of high school and broke up when they went to college. Looking between them, ignoring the uncomfortable silence in the backyard, I had a horrible thought, one that I’d never worried about before, but now, after their comments… 

“Or is it ancient history?” 

There were gasps all around the table, and my mother said my name sharply. 

“Zinnia, you need to stop. It was just a joke.” 

Instead of sitting down or answering her, I turned to Dash. “I want to leave. Now.” 

—— 

“Zinnie, stop being ” he said, his face flushed from anger. 

Stop being what? 

“Now, Dash! I want to leave now.” I looked at my grandmother. “Thank you for making the cupcakes.” 

I walked out of the backyard to the front, not bothering to see if he’d follow. If he didn’t, I had my own set of car keys and I’d leave his ass here. Maybe tell him it was just a joke. Ha, ha, fucking ha. Maybe my sister could give him a ride home, and he could get her pregnant in the backseat of her 

car. 

But he was right behind me, angry, and he let me know that without saying a word by not opening the car door for me like he always did. Not a problem. I slammed his precious car door a little too hard, and although I felt his eyes snap at me, he didn’t say a word. 

The time to have kept his mouth shut would have been after everyone was watching us bite into our cupcakes, waiting in anticipation to see if we were having a boy or a girl. I saw the pink filling and immediately squealed. Honestly, I would have squealed either way — I was just excited knowing what we were having. We’d decided to wait for the gender reveal until everyone on both sides could make it**,** which is why we were only finding out a month before I was due. 

Seeing that pink filling, I turned to Dash, only to see him with an odd look on his face — disappointment? In fact, everyone around the table was quiet and no one seemed excited except

for my grandmother. 

“We’re having a girl!” I enthused, although it sounded awkward. I wondered if that would shake 

him out of his funk. 

“Yeah,” he said, and now the disappointment wasn’t just on his face but in his voice, too. He’d put the cupcake down and pushed the plate away as if it offended him. 

My mother stepped in. “Well, if at first you don’t get it right, try, try again.” 

Get it right? What? Who said that at a gender reveal? 

Dash gave a half smile at my mother, then he looked at my sister and grinned. “Why wait another two–and–a–half months? I’ll just get Iris pregnant.” 

Unbelievably, all my relatives roared at that. They couldn’t rejoice in a little girl, but they could 

laugh uproariously at a horrible, tactless comment. For a minute, I hoped I’d been adopted so I 

wasn’t related by blood to these people, but then I was distracted by the feeling that my stomach was going to revolt. 

“I’m game,” Iris joined in. “Ready when you are, Dash! For old time’s sake.” 

Then she puckered her lips and made a kissy sound at him. 

She’d actually brought up the time when she and Dash had dated almost fifteen years ago? What was going on here? 

That was when I’d stood up abruptly and sent my chair flying. 

Part 2– 

An Open Invitation 

Zinnia’s POV 

I didn’t say a word to my husband all the way home, even though once we pulled out of the driveway, he decided to talk to me**.** Inside my head, however, was a different story. 

“You’re overreacting,” he kept saying when I refused to say a word. “Zinnie, it was a joke.” 

You’re supposed to laugh *if* it’s a joke. 

“I wouldn’t actually try to get your sister pregnant.” 

Chart2-1 

You *used to* date her. *You saying you’d try to* get a *boy* with her means *you’re* unhappy we’re *having* a *girl*. *And talking* about cheating on me with my *sister?* So *nasty*. So inappropriate. 

“Everyone but you took it as a joke.” 

It *still doesn’t* mean *it* was an appropriate joke to make. *It* was completely *gross*. 

He gave up trying to talk with me after he told me he didn’t know why I was so upset about a joke. 

I couldn’t bear the thought of sleeping next to him, so I got ready for bed in the guest bathroom 

and went to the tiny third bedroom where we had a full size bed. Exhaustion hit me as he followed 

me into the room. 

“You’re taking this too far,” he accused me. Me! 

Pulling back the covers, I lay on my left side, my back to him. 

“Come sleep in our bed,” he tried coaxing me. “You’re spiraling out of control for what was 

nothing more than a joke. Do you honestly think I’d sleep with your sister?” 

“I don’t know what to think anymore,” I said in reply to that opening he gave me. “Thanks to 

your so–called joke, I’m now thinking you may be cheating on me with my sister or at the least thinking about it or her since you’re talking about getting her pregnant. I now know you’re disappointed we’re having a girl. I now have to wonder if you never really got over my sister and you married me *to* stay close to her. I now know neither of you gives a damn about my feelings since you sided together against me to make the joke.” 

“Do you hear yourself, Zinnie? All that from a motherfucking joke? Not sure when you lost your sense of humor, but I’m not going to keep trying to defend myself when you’re the only one who didn’t get the joke.*”* 

*Keep* fighting your *corner*. I *just told you how I felt*, and *you’re dismissing* what I said and *everything* I *felt*. 

In case I missed it from the exasperation in his voice, he slammed the door to the bedroom to let me know how displeased he was. Since I couldn’t sleep, I rested my body but my mind was getting 

a workout. 

I was married to a man who thought it was funny to share his disappointment that our baby was a girl, a disappointment that I never knew about. 

Chapter1 

1.01% 

I was married to a man who thought joking about cheating on me with my sister, who was his ex, was a joke. My own sister thought it was funny to go along with it and ask if he wanted to get started after dinner. I was the spawn of two people who chastised me for getting mad at my husband and sister for making such a horrible, tasteless joke. 

Maybe it was the hormones but I remembered another so–called joke, this time made by Dash’s very drunk father, at our rehearsal dinner. 

“*We’re* glad the two of you have found happiness in *your own way*. We never *thought* he’d *get over* his *first* love, but hey! Even *if* he didn’t*,* you’re the one he’s marrying so that’s just about *first* place!” 

While everyone was laughing, I’d gotten up from the table and walked away, knowing Dash’s first love was my sister. Dash had hurried after me, apologizing for what his father said, but then he’d told me it was just a joke, and I needed to come back in so I didn’t ruin the evening and make his dad feel bad. Since the wedding was so close, because I didn’t want there to be strained relations at our wedding, I went back and made amends. 

Now, I was tired of jokes. I was tired of being told I was the one with the problem. I was tired of having to swallow down so–called jokes to keep the peace. I should have walked away after that rehearsal dinner and not married Dash. Then I wouldn’t be in this situation right now. 

No, I was the peacemaker, the one who put up with shit so I wouldn’t rock the boat. So no one would feel uncomfortable. So everyone would be happy. So someone else — namely Iris — could shine with her more outgoing, demanding personality. 

It wasn’t OK when it just me but I’d allowed it like a chump since I never wanted to make waves. Now, however, I was thinking about my daughter – apparently, I was the only one who wanted her – and what my lack of a spine would teach her. No lesson I wanted her to learn. 

Think, Zinnia. What if she came to me and told me this, that her husband had made a terrible joke about impregnating her sister? 

“I’d tell her to stop taking it and leave him until he could change his attitude and see why it was wrong,” I whispered out loud in the darkness. 

A whisper in the dark can be more powerful than a shout in the daylight. 

Where could I go? Not to my parents. Not to my sister. I was going no contact for a while with them. I was one month from my due date, and since I worked from home as a medical Chapter1 

1.01% 

transcriptionist, I was portable. I could work anywhere. I suddenly realized where I could go if my husband wouldn’t leave our home. 

The next morning, I was sitting at the kitchen table with my morning tea. I’d never been much of a coffee drinker, which my husband couldn’t understand. He came into the kitchen about half an 

hour later, ready for work, tie straight, the young doctor ready to see patients. 

He immediately spied his phone on the table. 

“I took it while you were in the shower,” I explained. 

Yeah, I figured that I’d admit it right up front, and I didn’t even care if it was wrong. If he was going to make jokes about impregnating his former girlfriend and then try to minimize how much 

it had hurt me by saying it was a joke, I was going to search for answers on my own. 

“Unfortunately, I couldn’t get into it since you changed your passcode.” 

“Why are you trying to go through my phone?” 

“Why wouldn’t I be able to go through your phone, Dash?” 

“You’d have a fit **if I** tried to go through your phone.” 

Avoid. Deflect. Not helping to reassure me. 

“No, I wouldn’t because I have nothing to hide.” I pushed my phone across the table to him. “You know the passcode. I haven’t felt the need to change it.” 

“This is bullshit.” 

“Open your phone and let me see your texts.” 

“No. It’s the principle of the thing. I’m not letting you see my texts.” 

As I’d expected. Still a blow, but not altogether surprising. People only protected their phones when they had something to hide. 

“I wanted to talk last night over with you. See if you’d realize how awful your so–called joke was and give you a chance to apologize.” 

“You’re the one that blew up at Iris and me, Zinnie. You’re the one that couldn’t take a damn joke and ruined the night for everyone.”

“I’m saying it was nothing to get upset about, but I’m trying to be patient and keep your 

condition in mind.” 

“You’re ignoring that I was upset. Extremely upset and I’ve already told you the reasons why. But your entire reaction to my feelings being hurt was to tell me I couldn’t take a joke.” 

“Because it was a joke! Why can’t you just let this go? It’s not that serious.” 

“It was to me,” and I hated that my voice still sounded small. No wonder no one took me 

seriously. 

“You’re going to laugh about this after the baby comes and your sense of humor returns.‘ 

“No, I won’t ever laugh about what was said last night. Even if you didn’t take time to think last night after we got home, *I* did. I did a lot of thinking, and I realized I want some space, Dash.” 

“Is it the pregnancy that’s making you act like this? What does that mean, you want space?” 

“Exactly what it sounds like. I want you to move out for a while. Go home to your parents. Go stay with my sister and use this time to impregnate her with the boy you clearly want. I don’t even care right now. All I know is I don’t want to be around you.” 

I can’t be around you. That’s how mad you 

made me, 

“Now you want us to separate? Zinnie, that is not a normal response to what was nothing more than a joke. I want you to call your doctor today, get in to see her immediately and see if there’s something off in your bloodwork because the Zinnia I know would never act like this.” 

“No, you wouldn’t know this version of me because I always accepted whatever was thrown at me to keep the peace, but last night I realized that’s not the example I want to set for my daughter – you know, the baby you’re disappointed is a girl? I want her to stand up for herself and say no. So I need to do that for her sake.” 

Dash glanced at his watch. 

“I’m not moving out, so get that out of your head. We’ll talk more tonight if you really feel that 

Chapter1 

1.01% 

strongly about it. I have to get going to make my shift.” 

He leaned down to kiss me, but I reared back so his lips didn’t connect with mine, and he sighed as 

if I was the problem. 

“Is that your final decision about not moving out?” I asked. 

“Yeah. I’m not moving out of my own home because you suddenly lost your sense of humor about a lighthearted joke. That’s way over the top, Zinnie.” 

“I needed you to care about how I felt over this, Dash,” I said, resigned. 

“If it was something serious, I would have cared, Zin. But this is you getting bent out of shape about a joke.” 

If I had any reservations about my course of action, that parting shot from Dash wiped them away. 

He must have made some calls on the way to the hospital because both my mother and Iris called me multiple times. I didn’t pick up because I was too busy packing, which meant they started texting me. The fact that he felt like it was a good idea to call my sister and my mother didn’t help his cause, and it just made me angrier. As a person who was used to pushing her anger aside, that bubbling, boiling sensation I was feeling inside felt good. Strong. 

If Dash wouldn’t leave, then I would because I hadn’t been kidding when I said I needed space. 

Maybe I was overreacting. Maybe my response was extreme. But maybe all my years of underreacting in the past had come to a boiling point and this joke suddenly and without warning became my line in the sand. I needed to think this through calmly and since I couldn’t be calm around my husband, I wouldn’t be able to think. 

Putting three small carry–on suitcases in the trunk, I headed out to the only person in the world who might have my back, and I didn’t even know her all that well but instinctively trusted her. She was my great aunt – my paternal grandmother’s sister. She lived on a commune, and I’d met Aggie several times growing up, liking her hippie vibe and direct attitude. My grandmother had taken me for a week every summer, but Iris and my parents never joined us because Mom and Dad thought communes were places where hippies lived to avoid being productive members of society. They never wanted to hear when I tried to explain what the commune was actually like. 

The last time I’d seen Aggie had been when I was fourteen, at my grandmother’s funeral. She’d been killed in a car accident, and Aggie had come for her service. A quiet woman, Aggie had been reserved with my parents and sister, but she gave me a hug and told me I was welcome to come

1oeqvcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1oeqvcp/best_travel_backpack_with_wheels/,Best Travel Backpack With Wheels,"I'll be honest—I was skeptical about wheeled backpacks for years. They seemed like the mullet of luggage: business in the front, party in the back, and not particularly good at either job.

Then I spent three weeks dragging a regular backpack through European train stations and up four flights of stairs to a Paris Airbnb, and my 35-year-old back staged a revolt. I needed something that could roll through airports but convert to a backpack when those charming cobblestone streets (read: wheel-destroying death traps) inevitably appeared.

After testing several rolling backpacks and reading through hundreds of brutally honest reviews—because Reddit never lies about luggage—I've found the ones that actually deliver. Here's what surprised me most: you'll probably use the wheels 90% of the time and the backpack straps maybe twice per trip. But those two times? Absolute lifesavers.

The best travel backpack with wheels isn't trying to be the world's best backpack or the world's best roller bag. It's the Swiss Army knife of luggage—versatile enough to handle whatever your journey throws at you, without being mediocre at everything.

>🧠 **Still deciding?** You don’t need to reread the whole post. I’ve summarized all key specs, prices, and models inside a [**Backpack Comparison Sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16n-yjeyMhoZ3Jeut6NOWVY29Uz9RLUJROgv22E8POrI/).  
Think of it as your **cheat sheet** to finding the right backpack — free, easy to use, and updated regularly.

# 1. Osprey Farpoint Wheeled 36L – The Gold Standard

**Price:** \~$300 | **Weight:** 6.4 lbs | **Carry-On:** Yes

Let me start with the one that made me a believer.

The Osprey Farpoint Wheeled 36L is what happens when a company that actually understands backpacks decides to add wheels. Those oversized 90mm wheels glide over airport tile like butter, and when I hit the medieval streets of Bruges, the stowable harness system deployed in under 30 seconds.

Here's what matters: this thing is light. At 6.4 pounds empty, it doesn't eat into your airline weight allowance before you've packed a single sock. The clamshell opening means I can actually find my clothes without excavating like an archaeologist, and those internal compression straps kept everything from shifting during a particularly aggressive RyanAir landing.

The backpack mode shocked me with its comfort. Most convertible bags feel like strapping a filing cabinet to your shoulders, but Osprey's tensioned mesh back panel created an air gap that kept me from arriving at my hostel looking like I'd been through a car wash. The padded hip belt actually distributes weight properly.

**The reality check:** It's expensive. Like, ""do I really need to eat this week"" expensive. The single-bar handle feels slightly wobbly when you're speed-walking to catch a train (though it's held up fine). And if you're looking for external organization pockets, keep looking—this is a minimalist's dream and an overpacker's nightmare.

**Best for:** Serious travelers who want gear that lasts a decade and don't mind paying for quality. If you travel more than three times a year, the cost-per-trip math works out.

**Skip if:** You're a chronic overpacker or need laptop compartments with seventeen pockets for charging cables you'll never use.

# 2. Hynes Eagle 42L Rolling Backpack – The Budget Champion

**Price:** \~$110 | **Weight:** 4.96 lbs | **Carry-On:** Yes

This is the bag that made me question whether expensive gear is always worth it.

The Hynes Eagle 42L costs less than a decent dinner in Manhattan, yet it's been through six countries without falling apart. When I first saw the price tag, I assumed it would be the luggage equivalent of gas station sushi. I was wrong.

That 4.96-pound weight is genuinely impressive—it's the lightest on this list. The inline skate wheels roll smoothly enough that I've pulled it through airports one-handed while juggling coffee and my boarding pass. The detachable laptop sleeve fits up to 17 inches (though let's be real, if you're traveling with a 17-inch laptop, we need to talk about your life choices).

The compression straps actually work. I cinched down a week's worth of clothes and the bag stayed compact enough that budget airline gate agents waved me through without the dreaded ""that's too big"" conversation.

**The honest downsides:** The fabric feels thinner than premium brands—not flimsy, but you'll want to use the included wheel cover religiously to keep your clothes from getting dirty marks. The hideaway straps sometimes flop out when rolling (just tuck them back in). And there's no hip belt, so backpack mode is fine for short distances but you'll feel it after 20 minutes.

**Best for:** Budget-conscious travelers, students, or anyone who wants to test the wheeled backpack concept without a massive investment.

**Skip if:** You're planning to check this bag regularly (it'll survive, but premium bags will last longer) or need serious back support in backpack mode.

# 3. Eagle Creek Expanse Convertible International Carry-On – The Eco-Warrior

**Price:** \~$180-280 | **Weight:** 6 lbs 2 oz | **Carry-On:** Yes

Here's where sustainability meets function without the preachy vibes.

The Eagle Creek Expanse is made from 100% recycled ripstop fabric with bluesign certification, which means it was produced with minimal environmental impact. But here's the thing—it's not just eco-friendly virtue signaling. The bag genuinely performs.

The zip-away backpack straps disappear completely, which solved my biggest pet peeve: dangling straps that get caught in escalators or dragged through questionable airport floor grime. The Central Lock Point system lets you secure the entire bag with one lock instead of playing padlock Tetris with every zipper.

Water resistance saved my bacon when I got caught in a Copenhagen downpour. Everything inside stayed dry while I stood there looking like a drowned rat. The expansion zipper added about 20% more capacity when I inevitably bought too many souvenirs.

**The catch:** It's heavier than the Hynes Eagle and costs more, but you're paying for durability and Eagle Creek's legendary No Matter What warranty (they'll repair or replace it for life). The wheels are solid but not as smooth-rolling as Osprey's. And the 30L capacity is slightly smaller than others on this list.

**Best for:** Travelers who want their gear purchases to align with environmental values without sacrificing quality. Also great for business travelers—it looks professional.

**Skip if:** You need the absolute lightest option or want maximum capacity for longer trips.

# 4. Osprey Sojourn 80L – When Carry-On Just Won't Cut It

**Price:** \~$300 | **Weight:** 7 lbs 15 oz | **Carry-On:** No (you'll check this)

Sometimes you need more space, and the Sojourn 80L is Osprey's answer to ""but what if I want to bring my entire wardrobe?""

I tested this on a five-week trip where I needed winter coats, hiking gear, and beach clothes. The 80L capacity swallowed everything with room for the inevitable shopping haul. The HighRoad Chassis with robust wheels handled Prague's cobblestones without complaint—though I mostly rolled it because at this size, backpack mode is theoretical.

The full AG-suspension system (borrowed from Osprey's serious hiking packs) means you can actually wear this if needed. Adjustable torso, proper hip belt, the works. I wore it once, from the train platform up three flights of stairs to my rental apartment. My back didn't hate me afterward, which felt like a miracle.

The front-panel opening is clutch—I could repack the entire bag without upending everything onto a hotel bed.

**The reality:** It's too large for carry-on. You're checking this bag, period. It weighs nearly 8 pounds empty. And at $300, you're paying premium prices for premium capacity you might not always need.

**Best for:** Long-term travelers, digital nomads doing multi-month trips, or anyone who genuinely needs to pack for multiple climates in one journey.

**Skip if:** You're a light packer or prefer carry-on-only travel. This bag will encourage you to overpack.

# 5. Rick Steves Rolling Backpack – The Tried-and-True

**Price:** \~$190 | **Weight:** 5.5 lbs | **Carry-On:** Yes

Rick Steves has been shepherding Americans through Europe for decades, and his rolling backpack reflects that hard-won experience.

This bag is smaller (around 30L) and simpler than others on this list, which is either a blessing or a curse depending on your packing philosophy. The wide-tracking wheels (13 inches apart) provide excellent stability—I've never had it tip over, even when overpacked.

The hidden backpack straps pull out quickly, and while they lack the sophisticated suspension of Osprey bags, they're comfortable enough for short hauls. The top zippered pocket is perfect for travel documents, and the clean exterior design means you don't look like you're wearing a billboard.

**The honest assessment:** It's basic. Really basic. No laptop sleeve, minimal organization, and the capacity forces you to pack light (which Rick would argue is the point). The fabric feels durable but not fancy. It's the Honda Civic of rolling backpacks—reliable, practical, unglamorous.

**Best for:** Rick Steves tour participants (obviously), minimalist packers, or travelers who want time-tested reliability over flashy features.

**Skip if:** You need organization, laptop protection, or want the latest innovations in luggage technology.

# What to Actually Look For in a Wheeled Backpack

After testing these bags, here's what matters more than marketing promises:

**Weight is everything.** Every pound the empty bag weighs is a pound less of your actual stuff. Under 6 pounds is ideal; under 7 pounds is acceptable.

**Wheels matter more than you think.** Larger wheels (90mm+) handle rough terrain better. Inline skate-style wheels are smoother than cheaper plastic alternatives.

**You'll rarely use backpack mode.** Seriously. Everyone thinks they'll constantly switch back and forth. In reality, you'll use wheels 90% of the time and deploy the backpack straps for stairs and cobblestones. Choose based on wheel quality, not backpack features.

**Carry-on compliance is non-negotiable** unless you enjoy gate-check fees and baggage claim anxiety.

# The Bottom Line

If money is no object and you want the best overall experience, get the **Osprey Farpoint Wheeled 36L**. It's expensive but worth it for frequent travelers.

If you're budget-conscious or testing the wheeled backpack concept, the **Hynes Eagle 42L** delivers shocking value at $110. It's not perfect, but it's 90% as good as bags costing three times more.

The **Eagle Creek Expanse** splits the difference with solid performance, sustainability credentials, and a lifetime warranty.

After testing all of these, I sold my old regular backpack. My shoulders thanked me. My chiropractor was disappointed to lose the business.

1oeqswt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1oeqswt/aio_husband_gets_angry_with_me_whenever_i/,AIO husband gets angry with me whenever I criticize his toxic family,"My husband and I met online. Online he told me that his mother was cold and invalidating towards him growing up. That his therapist spoke to her about his issues and that she sat there stone faced, not saying a word. He said his therapist found this unusual and commented on it. He asked me, knowing I had experience with narcissists, if she sounded like one. We met in person and twice I overheard him on the phone with his mother calling her a b*tch and telling her to shut up repeatedly. I didn't know what it was over. Then I went back to the UK with him. 

I had bad social anxiety which led to me being reclusive for years. He was aware of this and the fact I was unlikely to interact with his family because of it. He tried anyways to get me to talk to his mother and his grandmother. I found it easier to talk to his grandmother because she started the conversation and put more effort in, something that his mother didn't do very much. He tried to push me to speak to her, told me what to say at times, and got frustrated whenever I wasn't able to do it. At the same time he told me often that she was in a mood when she was downstairs making a lot of noise. 

He told me that he went to throw something away and she randomly called him a c*nt. He frequently called her a b*tch, particularly whenever she would back out of agreements she'd made, or would complain when doing whatever it was. All of this put me off interacting with her even more. He started to threaten me with her during arguements and disagreements, ones which he had started. When I called my mother, and told her how he was treating me, he responded by shoving me into the kitchen counter. He justified it, said I deserved it, because I had slandered him. 

He began to threaten to call both his mother and his grandmother during arguements. He lied about having done so and fabricated what they'd said. He admitted to this and assured me he'd never speak badly of me to anyone. Eventually he did call his mother during arguments. I don't know what he told her the first several times but she messaged me. She seemed to think I was the issue. He called her during arguements he started and/or esclated that happened in the car. During which he was screaming at me, threatening me, and driving recklessly. He made it out I was the instigator and that I was the one endangering us. 

I spoke up and said what he was doing one of the times and she didn't respond. From that point on he didn't have to involve her because she would involve herself, assuming right away that I was the problem, completely ignorant to what was actually going on or how he was treating me. He said she criticized me multiple times but then said he fabricated most of what he claimed she said. He swore she didn't take sides, and that he told her he was to blame after most of the arguments, but there was nothing to suggest he actually did this. When he called her one of the times she called me controlling and emotionally abusive. 

When I spoke up about how he was treating me again she didn't respond. He said she just wanted us to stop arguing and she didn't care about specifics. She messaged me again when he failed to respond after an argument, asking if he was okay. He stopped badmouthing her early on, whenever he started using her against me. He told me he was wrong about her. After that he started to defend her against any perceived slight from me, attacking me whenever he thought I disrespected her in any way. If I criticize her at all, he gets angry. He acts like I am not allowed to since I live here rent free. 

His entire family seems toxic. He told me his dad abused him growing up. He said he never wanted to be like him (he is exactly like him now) He would criticize him on and off with his mother. His dad has anger outbursts and manic highs that irriate the both of them. On top of that he does things that cross boundaries like taking things without asking. It bothers my husband, he complains about it, but if I do the same then he minimizes it and gets bothered by me criticizing his dad. He says we live here rent free so he's not going to go to his dad over it. Then there's his brother who is worse than his dad. 

Since he was a teenager he has taken and thrown things out that are not his own. My husband said he took his phone charger once, refused to give it back, and they got into a psychical fight over it. He took his expensive mattress and swapped it with his own. He took things like cardboard boxes out of the attic and pots and pans from the kitchen and threw them out. He took my husband's car several times without asking and brought it back in a bad state. He also charged his Netflix account after he canceled it. This was probably an accident according to his mother. 

The thing is, he's never held accountable for any of this. Apart from my husband going to his mother over it, who dismisses it, he does nothing else about it. He lets it go and so it keeps happening. He says that his brother has OCD and seems to find it funny he throws things away. I've always been worried he'd throw my stuff away but I'm assured that wouldn't happen. A few weeks back my husband decided to put my coffee machine downstairs, the one that he gifted me a few Christmases ago. I told him not to and that it would get broken or go missing. He didn't think that would happen. 

Today he went into the kitchen and it was gone. He asked his mother about it and she said that she didn't see it, that she didn't know that it was there. He figured that his brother threw it out after finding the coffee pods in the bin. He messaged him asking if he threw it away, adding that it was his coffee machine, and that he was either going to sell it or put it down for everyone to use. He came up to me and told me what happened. I complained and as I did he blanked me, looking at something on his phone. I said so you're just going to tell me that and go quiet and he snapped at me. 

I continued to complain and he agreed with most of what I said about it, about how it was wrong, and about how his brother should have asked first. All the other times he'd go to his mother over things between his dad or his brother. He said that this time she told him she was tired of it, and to leave her out of it. I said that she should be scolding her son for this behavior. The fact that she doesn't is the reason he's like this. He said that they are two grown men now and keep it between themselves. I went to post about it and he didn't want me to. He said there was no point getting opinions from strangers online. 

He said it wasn't going to change anything and he's done all he can. I continued to criticize his brother and eventually his entire family. He became angry with me over this. Especially so after I said that this is the result of bad parenting, enabling, and toxic/narcissistic family dynamics. He downplayed and minimized a lot of what I mentioned that his mother, father, and brother have done. When at the time he got angry over all of it. It's like he can complain as much as he wants but I can't, even if I'm repeating back what he's said. He started making excuses for his brother after a while. 

He said his disorder is behind this and that he struggles to keep it under control. That he feels a compulsion to throw things, things he perceives as not being used or in the way, and can't stop thinking about it until he does. That he's talked to a doctor about this before. He said it wasn't an intentional/personal thing in that he didn't know it was my coffee machine. That perhaps he thought it wasn't being used since it sat there so long. Eventually he said it could've looked like something that was being thrown out since it was just sat there in a pile, not plugged in or anything. 

He acted like I had went too far or was too upset over it. He said I had a right to be but the more I criticized his brother, the more he defended and made excuses for him. He also acted like he was getting the brunt of it and said he had nothing to do with it. When he put it down there and I told him not to. He said he didn't expect this to happen. He said if he went to his mother again over it he'd stir up drama like before. ",1,1761288685.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

Most vacuum compression backpacks feature a built-in sealed compartment with a valve system. You pack your clothes, seal the compartment, attach a small electric pump (usually USB-rechargeable), and watch your bulky sweaters shrink down to half their size. The result? A 40-liter backpack that can theoretically hold what would normally fit in a 60-liter bag.

The technology reduces clothing volume by 50-60% according to manufacturers. In my real-world testing? More like 40-50%, but that's still significant.

# The Hard Truth Nobody Mentions

Before we get to the good stuff, let me save you from my mistakes.

**You will be tempted to overpack.** This is the #1 problem I didn't anticipate. When you can fit 18 shirts in a space meant for 8, you'll convince yourself you need all 18. Then you'll stand at airport check-in watching the scale hit 18kg on what's supposed to be a carry-on, wondering where it all went wrong.

**You'll need to recompress between destinations.** Changed hotels? Opened your bag to grab a sweater? Congratulations, now you need to repack and re-vacuum everything before your next flight. I learned this the hard way in Porto when I couldn't fit everything back in without the pump—which, naturally, I'd left charging at the previous hotel.

**The pump becomes another thing to remember.** Charge it. Pack it. Don't lose it. The pump typically needs 6 hours for a full charge and weighs about 11 ounces. That's not much, but it's one more device competing for outlet space in your Airbnb.

# The 5 Best Vacuum Compression Backpacks (Tested in Real Travel Conditions)

# 1. Airback Original - The Premium Choice That Actually Delivers

**Price:** $219-308 (depending on sales)  
**Capacity:** 22L base, expands to 47L with compression  
**Best for:** Frequent travelers who value quality over budget

Airback won multiple design awards (Red Dot 2025, iF Design 2024) and honestly, you can feel why. The 900D recycled nylon feels substantial without being heavy, and the vacuum zipper—while frustratingly tight to open—creates an actually airtight seal that holds for days.

**What worked:** The build quality is exceptional. After three months of testing, the zippers still glide smoothly, the compression holds perfectly, and the laptop compartment (fits up to 15"") has padding that actually protects. The built-in TSA lock is stitched into the fabric, which means one less thing to lose.

**What didn't:** That capacity claim of 47L? In reality, I got closer to 35-40L even with maximum compression. Still impressive, but don't plan your packing around the advertised number. Also, this thing isn't light—the backpack itself weighs about 3.3 pounds before you add anything.

**Real talk:** Some models include a built-in weight scale on the handle, which proved surprisingly useful for avoiding baggage fees. The pump is sold separately for $75, which feels a bit nickel-and-dimey at this price point.

**Who should buy this:** You fly monthly, you're tired of checking bags, and you want something that'll last years.  
**Who should skip this:** Budget travelers or anyone doing multi-destination trips where you're constantly repacking.

# 2. Titantrek Atlas Vault - The Budget Winner That Surprised Me

**Price:** $137 (regularly $238)  
**Capacity:** 40L  
**Best for:** First-time compression backpack buyers

When I saw the price, I expected corner-cutting. Instead, I got probably the best value in this entire category.

**What worked:** The 17-inch laptop compartment beats Airback's 15-inch limit. The waterproof coating actually works—I got caught in a downpour in Lisbon and everything stayed dry. The separate mini pump compresses a full load in about 90 seconds. Multiple reviewers mentioned feeling ""light even when heavy,"" and after carrying this fully packed for a week, I agree completely.

**What didn't:** The aesthetic is... functional. This looks like a serious travel backpack, not something you'd casually carry to a coffee shop. The shoulder straps took a few days to break in, though the ergonomic back panel genuinely helps with weight distribution.

**Real talk:** At $137, this is a steal. The 4.88/5 rating from 24 reviews isn't inflated—people genuinely love this thing for good reason.

**Who should buy this:** Anyone wanting to try vacuum compression without dropping $300+.  
**Who should skip this:** Style-conscious travelers who want their gear to look as good as it functions.

# 3. Black Voyage Vortex - The Feature-Packed Middle Ground

**Price:** $150-200  
**Capacity:** 60L when fully expanded  
**Best for:** Digital nomads who need organization options

Black Voyage stuffed this thing with features: wet/dry separation layer, power bank pocket, thermal bag, anti-theft pocket, USB 4.0 charging ports. It's like they asked every travel blogger what they wanted and actually listened.

**What worked:** The organizational compartments are genuinely thoughtful. Wet swimsuit? Separate pocket. Dirty shoes? Another pocket. The 19-inch laptop compartment accommodates even large gaming laptops. The included pump handles both compression and inflation (useful for travel pillows, pool floats).

**What didn't:** With all these features comes complexity. There are so many compartments that I sometimes forgot where I'd stashed things. The 60L capacity claim is accurate only when you're using every pocket and the compression system simultaneously—realistically, plan for 45-50L.

**Real talk:** This feels designed by people who actually travel long-term. The luggage attachment strap works brilliantly if you're combining a roller bag with a backpack.

**Who should buy this:** Long-term travelers or digital nomads who live out of their bag.  
**Who should skip this:** Weekend warriors or anyone who prefers minimalist designs.

# 4. Vacpack - The TikTok Viral One (With Caveats)

**Price:** Variable (often around $100-150)  
**Capacity:** Claims to hold 5x more than regular backpacks  
**Best for:** Curious first-timers on a budget

This is what started my vacuum compression journey. The TikTok videos make it look magical. The reality is... more complicated.

**What worked:** When it works, the compression is genuinely impressive. I fit a week's worth of clothes plus shoes in the vacuum compartment, with room left in the other pockets for electronics and toiletries.

**What didn't:** Consumer Reports found several design flaws, and I encountered some too. The pump was sold separately when I bought mine (adding $10), and the purchasing process was confusingly buried. The 6-hour charge time meant I always needed to plan ahead. The laptop compartment zipper doesn't go all the way down, making access awkward.

**Real talk:** This works fine for occasional use, but the build quality doesn't inspire confidence for frequent travel. Think of this as your ""testing the waters"" option before investing in something better.

**Who should buy this:** Budget-conscious travelers who want to try vacuum compression before committing.  
**Who should skip this:** Anyone planning frequent or long-term travel.

# 5. Ekster TravelPack Vacuum Kit - The Alternative Approach

**Price:** $59+  
**Capacity:** Modular bags that fit inside any backpack  
**Best for:** People who already love their current backpack

Here's a curveball: what if you don't need a whole new backpack? Ekster makes modular vacuum compression bags that fit inside your existing luggage.

**What worked:** This is brilliant for people like me who already have a backpack they love. The anti-rip nylon handles abuse, the USB-C rechargeable pump is tiny, and the bags double as laundry organizers. Plus, at $59, it's the most affordable way to test vacuum compression.

**What didn't:** You're managing separate bags instead of an integrated system. The bags work best with specific packing techniques (rolling clothes before compressing). You'll need to be more organized than with an all-in-one solution.

**Real talk:** Forbes called this ""a must-have for travelers who never check a bag,"" and I'm inclined to agree. This is my go-to recommendation for people unsure about vacuum backpacks.

**Who should buy this:** Anyone with a backpack they already love, or travelers who want maximum flexibility.  
**Who should skip this:** People who want an all-in-one solution without managing separate components.

>✈️ **Quick note:** Before we jump into individual recommendations, you can see all the backpacks (plus a few bonus models) in my [**Backpack Comparison Spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16n-yjeyMhoZ3Jeut6NOWVY29Uz9RLUJROgv22E8POrI/).  
It’s a sortable Google Sheet with filters for **capacity, price range, USB type, and rating** — perfect if you want to skim through all the options at once.

# What About Wrinkles?

Let's address the elephant in the compressed bag: yes, vacuum compression can wrinkle clothes. But it's not as bad as you think if you pack smart.

**What worked for me:**

* Roll clothes before compressing (distributes pressure more evenly)
* Pack wrinkle-resistant fabrics (polyester blends, merino wool)
* Don't overcompress—leave a bit of air to reduce pressure on folds
* Unpack and hang items immediately upon arrival

**What didn't work:**

* Compressing linen (looked like I'd slept in it)
* Folding dress shirts flat before vacuuming (instant creases)
* Leaving clothes compressed for more than 3-4 days

Most casual clothes (t-shirts, jeans, athletic wear) emerge relatively unscathed. Business attire and nice dresses? Pack those in garment bags or compression cubes instead.

# The Honest Verdict: Are Vacuum Compression Backpacks Worth It?

**You should get one if:**

* You regularly fly carry-on only
* You travel to cold climates and need bulky layers
* You're organized enough to manage the pump and recompression
* You hate checking bags and paying fees

**Skip them if:**

* You move between hotels every 2-3 days
* You already pack light successfully with regular cubes
* You travel with lots of wrinkle-prone business attire
* You tend to forget to charge devices (that pump needs power!)

**My personal pick?** For most travelers, I'd recommend the Titantrek Atlas Vault ($137) for all-in-one convenience, or the Ekster TravelPack ($59) if you love your current backpack. Save the Airback splurge for when you're sure vacuum compression fits your travel style.

The real secret nobody tells you: vacuum compression backpacks aren't magic. They're tools that work brilliantly for specific use cases and create more problems than they solve for others. The trick is figuring out which camp you're in before spending $300.

**One final tip from my mistakes:** Start with a shorter trip (3-4 days) before committing to a two-week journey with vacuum compression. You'll quickly discover whether the trade-offs work for your travel style—preferably before you're standing in a Barcelona hostel at 2 AM, manually squeezing air out of a bag because you forgot to charge the pump.

Your clothes might be compressed, but your travel stress doesn't have to be.

## Role description
## About Buffer
We create social media and brand-building software for small businesses, creators, and individuals. Our mission is to provide essential tools to help small businesses get off the ground and grow. Through exceptional customer service and uplifting content, we help our customers believe they can succeed and do good along the way.
Buffer is a fully distributed team, and we’ve always aimed to do things a little differently at Buffer. Since the early days, we’ve focused on building one of the most unique and fulfilling workplaces by rethinking a lot of traditional practices. We also default to transparency, so you can read all about our metrics, and our successes and failures along the way on our Transparency Dashboard.
We're united by Buffer's values, and we hire and work from all over the world. We strive to create a diverse and inclusive work environment, and we are building a culture where underrepresented groups are welcome and can flourish. Please note that we do travel to work together in person once or twice per year, and those events are highly encouraged to build deeper connections among our small team.
As you get to know Buffer and consider joining the journey, feel free to read more from Kirsti and Sabreen as they share their first experiences with Buffer, as well as from Hailley, who captured why she still calls Buffer home after 8+ years.
## About the role
We're looking for an engineering manager for both our Content Creation and Content Engagement teams, covering the full content lifecycle at Buffer. You'll guide 7 engineers working on content creation (composer, AI features, planning tools) and engagement (comments, audience growth).
We're looking for an engineering manager who is **in the details**. Someone who maintains deep context on technical challenges, asks informed questions, and can guide strategic tradeoffs. This isn't a pure people management role. We expect our EMs to stay close to the code and architecture even if they're not writing production code daily.
We are a dynamic, lean, and fast-moving engineering team focused on the consistent delivery of value to delight our customers. We care about the quality of our product and by working small with a continuous improvement mindset, we aim to leave our code well-tested and better than when we started.
You'll partner closely with Product and Design to shape technical direction, create space for engineers to do their best work, and build a culture of ownership and continuous improvement.
## What you'll do
  * **Lead 2 engineering teams** - Content Creation and Content Engagement, creating an environment where engineers can do deep, focused work while staying connected
  * **Partner with Product and Design** partners to shape technical direction, balance speed with quality, and guide architectural decisions that support long-term scalability
  * **Model Buffer values** in your decision-making and communication, setting the cultural tone for both teams
  * **Develop your engineers** through regular 1:1s, coaching, actionable feedback, and career development conversations that help them grow their skills and advance
  * **Build a strong feedback culture** within the teams where growth is continuous, expectations are clear, and engineers feel supported to take risks and learn
  * **Lead with technical depth** by maintaining strong context on architectural challenges, participating in technical discussions, and making informed tradeoffs
  * **Manage team operations** , including capacity planning, hiring, on-call practices, and removing blockers
  * **Track and communicate team health metrics** to ensure sustainable performance and make data-informed decisions about team structure and processes
  * **Coordinate within Engineering Leadership group** (other Engineering Managers and Staff Engineers) on shared initiatives, represent team needs across the organization, and build trust and alignment
  * **Take shared ownership of product quality and system health** by ensuring sustainable practices, and balancing technical debt with feature delivery


## Helpful skills and experience
  * You have 5+ years of experience managing software engineers with demonstrated ability to build high-performing teams that deliver high-quality software in small iterations and reduce cycle time
  * You have a strong technical background with the ability to engage in architectural discussions, code reviews, and technical strategy. You maintain an up-to-date understanding of the architectural challenges your teams face
  * You think in systems. You have the ability to see patterns across teams and make architectural decisions that create leverage
  * You know how to lead remote teams, balancing synchronous collaboration with written communication across time zones (your teams will span the US and Europe). 
  * You focus on people development. You have a track record of coaching engineers, providing regular feedback, holding team members accountable, and creating fulfilling work experiences
  * You partner well with Product and Design. You have experience working closely with Product and Design partners, bringing forward feasibility considerations and collaborating on lean ways to deliver outcomes
  * You know how to hire and onboard engineers and have experience building strong engineering teams and retaining talent
  * You have project management strength. You can lead teams to ship MVPs, get early data and feedback, and make customer-centric decisions
  * _You have a creator mindset_. You have a personal connection to content creation, social media, or creator tools. It's a big plus if you used Buffer before and care about the experience
  * You communicate exceptionally well in writing. You have strong written communication skills for distributed collaboration
  * You have a growth mindset. You are humble, comfortable with ambiguity, and commitment to continuous learning


## Our tech stack
Your teams work across the full stack in a single monorepo.
**Frontend:**
  * React and TypeScript
  * Internal design system (Popcorn) built on top of Radix UI with CSS modules and Storybook, 
  * Vite for build tooling
  * Jest and React Testing Library for testing
  * Playwright for E2E tests


**Backend:**
  * Node.js and TypeScript
  * GraphQL with Apollo (migrating away from REST)
  * MongoDB as our main database
  * Microservices architecture (consolidating into monorepo)
  * We also have a legacy PHP backend that we are slowly migrating over to the monorepo


**Infrastructure:**
  * AWS with Kubernetes
  * Feature flags for gradual rollouts
  * Datadog for monitoring and observability


**AI/ML:**
  * Integration with various LLM providers
  * Building internal abstractions for AI features


As an EM, you don't need to be actively coding, but you should be comfortable engaging in technical discussions, understanding architectural decisions, and occasionally diving into code to unblock or guide the team.
## Interview process
Here's what our hiring process for this role is like.
  1. **Application.** When submitting your application and resume, tell us why you want to join Buffer and take your time. This is your chance to make a strong first impression.
     * _Please note_ : While we have several engineering roles open, we recommend applying to only one role - just choose one that resonates with you the most. If during our review or interviews we think you'd be great for a different position, we'll re-route your application internally.
  2. **Hiring manager interview (starting week of November 17th).** Chat with Mike, Director of Engineering at Buffer, to understand what it takes to work at Buffer. This is an opportunity for both sides to get to know each other and determine whether our expectations align.
  3. **Asynchronous assignment.** We'll send you
  4. **Management interview.** Interview with engineering managers from Buffer focused on your management approach, performance management, people growth, team processes, and cross-team collaboration.
  5. **Team interview.** Meet Product partner and engineers from the team to talk about your approach to leadership, team's work process and technical challenges.
  6. **Meet the CEO.** At the very end, you will have the opportunity to meet with Joel Gascoigne, our CEO. This is a great chance for you to gain a deeper understanding of Buffer's strategy, values, and work processes.
  7. **Collaboration period.** This is experimental stage for us where you would work with us over a few days (fully paid). The goal is to see how it feels to work in the team, both for us and for you. You'll meet a few bufferoos, and invite you to a Slack where you'll collaborate with the team.
  8. **Offer.** We wrap it up with an offer and discuss the final details. We would align on the last bits before we make you part of the Buffer team 💛


_At Buffer, we value diversity of experience, and we understand that comes in many forms. We’re dedicated to adding new perspectives to the team. So, if your experience is close to what we’re looking for, please consider applying._

Why would you like to work at Buffer?
Tell us about a time you had to align engineering priorities with product goals. How did you approach that partnership, and what did you learn?
Tell us about your personal experience with content creation and social media
We're looking for someone who understands the creator experience firsthand. Tell us about your own content creation - whether that's sharing projects, writing, posting on social media, or building an audience with newsletter or blog. Feel free to share examples!
What makes a high-performing team?
Tell us about a time when you were wrong about something at work. What happened, and how did you handle it?
If you were to join our team, what improvements would you propose to our product? Please be specific.
Based on your experience using Buffer, what would you change or build? This could be a specific improvement, a new feature, or a broader strategic shift in direction.
Please record a 2-4 minute video sharing something you've learned recently
This could be anything: management-related, technical, or not. Something you built, a new tool you tried, something you learned from a book or a side project. We’re more interested in how you share ideas than the topic itself.
As a remote team, we use video a lot - in meetings and pairing sessions, sharing Looms in Slack or adding demos to pull requests. It’s just part of how we work day-to-day, which is why we decided to include it in our hiring process too.
Think of it as a casual conversation with a teammate. No need for slides, script, editing, or polish. Just speak naturally and feel free to share your screen if it helps tell the story, like you would in a team call.
We know this is a big ask. But if your application is a strong fit, we’ll absolutely watch your video - and you’ll hear back from us either way.
Feel free to use the free version of Loom, or any other video recorder and share a link with us.

I know 400 mg is the recommended amount for the average adult, but I'm 4'11 and weigh like 93 pounds so I know I can't exactly take that suggestion at face value. I have been drinking coffee relatively frequently for years though, and I often get 20 oz drinks from a local place that have 4 shots of espresso in them, and I handle those just fine. Tolerance differs between people, and I'd assume mine is pretty high? But I don't know whether weight or tolerance is a bigger factor to worry about here. I did actually drink two of them a few nights ago, and as far as I know I was fine, but I don't want to make a habit of it if there's anything to be severely worried about.

Am I an asshole that I wish he had once said, ""Here shout yourself a coffee on me"". He knows I go for coffee every day. Or ""I bought you a chocolate"". ? 

It has got to the point in my feeling a tiny bit unappreciated. though he never asked for any meals at all of course. I just wish he had done me one kindness in return. Like a practical kindness.

I spoke to this guy briefly at an event and really liked his energy. I reached out on social and asked him to coffee, do which he said yes but it’s hectic with work at the moment. That he will reach out when it settles down.

I pressed my ear against everything in the room — the bedframe, the nightstand, the lamp, even the white noise machine I use to drown out the world. Nothing. I checked the drawers, the walls, the carpeted floor. I even climbed up and touched the ceiling, the light fixture. Still nothing.

Then I stood in the middle of the room and turned slowly, tilting my head like a radar dish. That’s when I found it — the sound wasn’t coming from anything. It was just *there*, suspended in the air, dead center above my bed.

I froze. My mind raced for any logical explanation, but nothing fit. I lived alone in my detached home. No loud neighbors nearby. No machines running. No interference. Just silence, except for that piercing tone.

I thought maybe it was coming from the living room — maybe one of the cameras or the console was acting up. I walked over, checked everything. Nothing. No sound. No anomaly.

But I had work to do. A deadline, and I was already very behind. My edge-based computer vision application needed final testing before deployment. I had test suites to run, bugs to squash, and a few dreaded code reviews with my colleagues. I buried myself in the basement lab, surrounded by wires and lenses and monitors displaying code or mock surveillance footage.

I told myself I’d deal with the sound later.

…

It was 10:47 PM.

All the deadline tasks were complete. The test suites had finished running. Every bug identified had been resolved. I’d endured two meticulous code reviews with my seniors — both harrowing, but somehow I passed. If you could call it that.

Tomorrow, I planned to run one final suite before sending it off to the QA team for finalization.

I headed to the bedroom, ready to shut down for the night. But as I stepped inside, the sound was still there. That same high-frequency tone — sharp, constant, pressing against my skull like a vice. I could feel it behind my ears, a terrible pressure. Migraine territory. Maybe. Who knows. Only God did.

I cursed under my breath and tried to push through. I brushed my teeth. Washed my face. Changed into my nightwear.

Then — silence.

The sound vanished. Just like that. I checked my phone. 11:00 PM, exactly.

Finally, some relief.

Before I could sleep, I needed to activate the home security system. I walked out into the hallway, which led to the living room and kitchen. That’s when I noticed something strange.

My coffee mug was sitting on the dining table.

Odd. I always cleaned up after myself. Routine. Habit. I was certain I’d placed it in the dishwasher earlier. I must have forgotten. I shrugged it off, picked it up, and put it away.

As I turned to leave the kitchen, something else caught my eye — the coffee machine. A standard drip model. It was angled slightly toward the edge of the counter. Not where it should have been. I always kept it flush against the wall. My OCD wouldn’t have allowed otherwise.

I corrected it immediately.

Then I walked toward the living room. As I reached the threshold between the kitchen and hallway, I paused. Something felt... off. Like I’d walked farther than usual. I turned around.

The kitchen looked longer. Stretched. Subtly distorted, like a wide-angle lens had warped the space. I blinked, trying to recalibrate. Maybe I was just exhausted. A long day. Too much screen time.

I shook it off, activated the security system, and returned to the bedroom. I needed sleep.

…

Damn it.

That unbearable sound was back. Why? Why the hell was it back? Where was it coming from?

I jumped out of bed, determined to finish my morning routine as fast as possible — anything to escape that godforsaken room.

I cut my usual three-minute shower down to two. Threw on my daywear. Bolted down the hallway. I brewed coffee, sat at the dining table in the living room, and tried to distract myself with the news.

One article caught my attention — a startup claimed it had developed a generative AI model capable of producing photorealistic surveillance footage from text prompts.

The claim was absurd. The demo video looked polished at first glance, but the flaws were obvious to anyone with experience. The human movement wasn’t smooth — subtle frame jumps broke the illusion. The people didn’t look quite human, either. And the door frame in the ATM vestibule couldn’t even hold its shape — it warped slightly between frames.

All subtle, but I’d spent years staring at real footage. I could see past the gloss.

I skimmed the rest of the article, rolled my eyes, and moved on.

I glanced at my mug, emptied of this morning’s coffee.

Why the hell would I leave it here last night? Like some barbarian?

I got up and walked to my office, just across from the bedroom. The buzzing sound was still present — unbearable. I sat on my chair, opened my computer, and pulled up yesterday’s surveillance footage from the living room camera.

I watched myself go through the day: grabbing coffee, sitting at the table, reading the news, walking to and from the office and basement lab. All normal. But I never saw myself place the mug on the table.

Not once.

What madness was this?

At exactly 11:00 PM, the feed glitched. A brief interruption — like tuning into a nonexistent channel on a 90s TV. Static. Visual and audio. Then the feed resumed.

That’s when I saw it.

The motion detection application began triggering in specific spots — but nothing was there. Nothing moved.

What. The. Hell.

I had tested this application thoroughly. Cleaned it. Sent it to QA. They passed it to DevOps. It was already deployed at customer sites. This was bad. Very bad.

I panicked and scrubbed through the footage again. The motion detection only triggered when I was present — no false positives all day. But at 11:00 PM, there it was. A false positive. Right in front of me.

I cursed. Loudly. A stream of expletives no child should hear — except maybe child processes. They didn’t care. They weren’t alive. Ha!

After recovering from that momentary lapse in sanity, I looked closer. The highlighted areas moved — slowly, deliberately — across the walkable parts of the living room. Not the ceiling. Not the walls. Just the floor. Back and forth.

At 11:12 PM, the highlighted area lingered near the dining table. Then, suddenly, the mug appeared.

At 11:13 PM, I entered the living room from the hallway. I stared at the mug, picked it up, and walked to the kitchen. The motion detection highlighted me — expected. But it also highlighted the space behind me.

As if something was following.

At 11:22 PM, I disappeared into the bedroom. The highlighted area followed. No motion was detected again until 11:53 PM. Then it reappeared — beside the dining table — and stayed there until 12:00 AM, when the feed glitched again. Static. One second. Then normal.

No motion was detected until I reentered the living room at 6:43 AM.

My thoughts raced. Surely this was an artifact — a glitch in the image processing pipeline of the application. Right?

I toggled off the motion detection overlay to view the raw footage. The more I stared, the more I saw it — a faint outline. A pattern. Hard to define.

I realized I could isolate it using my favorite image processing technique: Fast Fourier Transform. Or FFT for short.

I transformed each frame between 11:00 PM and 12:00 AM from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. A consistent, thin oval appeared in the high-frequency range of every frame. Same location. Same intensity.

Curiosity peaked. I applied a two-dimensional Gaussian-smoothed rectangular filter to isolate the feature. Reconstructed the images. Compiled them into a video.

Then I watched it.

I wasn’t prepared.

The footage was blurry, mostly black and white. The table and chairs were faintly visible. But there — in the center — was something else.

A tall, slender humanoid figure. Only faintly outlined. Soft, low-contrast contours. Wispy. Unstable. Like a ripple in glass. A shadow behind static.

I must have been going mad. My mind playing tricks. I was overworked. Yes. Overworked like a dog.

I reran the FFT processing. It was still there. I changed the parameters. Ran it again. Still there.

Either I was losing my mind — or this thing actually exists.

I flipped through the processed frames like stills from a horror film. The figure moved. Walked. Shifted. Changed shape.

Sometimes it became a cloud. A mist. Sometimes a tall, insect-like creature standing on its hind legs. The closest comparison I could think of was a mantis.

Then, at around 11:53 PM, the thing — the entity, whatever it was — reappeared. It slowly transformed back into a tall, humanoid shape. I watched as its head turned, slowly, deliberately. Like it was staring directly into the camera.

It held that pose until the feed was disrupted at 12:00 AM.

That was it. I needed a walk. I needed to call in sick — for the first time in five years working here.

My boss would understand. Right?

It was 7:37 AM. Enough time to do a final review, send the software to QA, call in sick, take a walk... and maybe never return.

Just keep walking. Into the sunset, maybe.

Yeah. That sounded nice.

My bladder was tingling — a warning sign from all the coffee I’d consumed.

I stood up and noticed the office door was open.

I swear I closed that door. I always close it when I’m working. Always.

I stepped into the hallway and looked left, then right. Nothing. I saw nothing. I heard nothing.

Wait.

I didn’t hear the sound.

That high-pitched Godforsaken tone — the one that had haunted me for days — was gone.

Normally, that would bring relief. But now, it terrified me. The silence felt wrong. 

I was too afraid to run to the bathroom. But I had to try. For the sake of my bladder.

I stepped out of the office and hurried into the bedroom, then the bathroom. Everything looked normal — except for the silence. That unnatural, oppressive silence.

After relieving myself, I walked through the house, checking every room. Every window. Every door that led outside. All were locked. The security system was still active. Nothing had triggered it.

I stood in the living room, debating whether to deactivate the system, when a sudden sensation gripped me — the feeling of being watched.

I turned around.

It looked familiar. But wrong.

The coffee table was too long — stretched unnaturally. The dining table looked shorter than it should, while the chairs around it seemed taller, almost looming. The room itself felt wider, but also compressed vertically, like the ceiling had dropped a few inches. The chandelier above the dining table emitted a faint blue glow, layered over its usual warm light, casting strange shadows that didn’t align with the furniture.

The walls had a subtle curvature, like the room was bending inward. The corners didn’t meet at perfect angles anymore. The air felt thicker, like walking through static.

I panicked.

I fled to the office, slammed the door shut, and locked it behind me.

Inside, the office was my sanctuary — or at least, it had been. But even here, things were wrong.

The bookshelf to my left was closer than it should have been, almost pressing against the desk. The desk itself looked warped — subtly curved, like heat had softened its edges. My monitor was normal in shape, but the screen emitted a faint purple glow, even when idle.

The walls felt too close. The ceiling too low. The air too still.

I sat down, trying to steady my breathing. I needed to think. I needed to believe this was all in my head.

I must’ve been having a mental breakdown. Yeah. That’s it! Hahaha! Can’t fool me, brain!

I logged into my computer and typed a message to my boss: *Too sick to work today.*  I hit send.

Nothing happened.

No confirmation. No sent icon. But the computer was still connected — Ethernet, full signal. It should’ve sent.

I grabbed my phone, hoping to try again — but immediately yelped and dropped it.

It was wrong.

Twisted. Bent. Warped beyond recognition, save for the screensaver I’d chosen. It looked like a pretzel. A grotesque, digital pretzel.

I laughed. A hearty, broken laugh.

How was this possible?

Then it hit me — why hadn’t I left the house? The exit was right there. Right beside the home security panel I’d been staring at earlier. Why did I go back to the office?

Then the motion detection alerts started.

First from the living room. One minute long.

Then — the office.

I looked up at the surveillance camera mounted on the ceiling. It looked thinner than usual. Shorter. Its lens glowed faintly blue. The ceiling around it reflected the same hue.

I turned toward the window behind my desk. In the glass, I saw the reflection of the office door — slowly opening.

A blinding blue light spilled in.

If I hadn’t been in fight-or-flight mode before, I was now.

The window looked just big enough to fit through. I shoved the monitor and keyboard off the desk, scattering them across the floor. I tried opening the window.

No luck.

Panicking, I scanned the room. My eyes landed on the heavy plaque hanging to the right of the window — a five-year employment award. Wood and metal. A reminder of my ungodly amount of unpaid overtime.

I ripped it off the wall and smashed it against the glass.

Crack. Again. Crack. Inch by inch, the hole widened.

Then, in the corner of my eye, I saw it.

The door behind me was fully open now. The blue light was overwhelming — almost blinding. And at the center of it stood a figure.

Barely visible. Just the faintest wispy contours. A tall, slender shape. Humanoid. But wrong.

It started walking toward me.

I freaked out. The hole in the window was no more than three feet wide — but screw it. It was do or die.

I dove through.

I landed hard on the grass outside. Thank God the office was on the ground floor. The fall wasn’t far — but the glass tore into me. Shards embedded in my arms, hands, legs.

It didn’t matter.

I ran.

No car. I’d left my keys inside. But screw that noise.

I just ran.

…

I didn’t know how far I’d run, but one of the officers patrolling the neighborhood eventually spotted me. Shelley pulled up beside me in her cruiser, concern etched across her face.

I told her the only thing I could without sounding insane — that my home had been invaded, and I’d escaped through the window.

She radioed for backup to check the house as she drove me to the nearest hospital.

While my wounds were being treated, another officer, Jeremy, approached me. He said the house was secure. No one else was there. Nothing was out of the ordinary.

The hospital patched me up with dissolvable stitches. The bill was steep, but insurance would cover some of it. My bank account would comfortably handle the rest.

Shelley offered to drive me home. I accepted. I didn’t want to stay there long. I just needed to pack.

She was kind enough to wait inside while I gathered my things.

I rushed to the bedroom, grabbed spare clothes. Retrieved my emergency laptop from the office. Then headed to the living room.

“I’m ready,” I told her.

But she frowned.

I paused. “What’s wrong?”

Her figure began to blur. The outline of her body shimmered, then softened. Wisps of transparency crept across her skin. She was fading. Becoming something else.

I stepped back, heart pounding.

Then she spoke — but it wasn’t Shelley’s voice.

It was flat. Mechanical. Like someone reading from a script they didn’t understand. No emotion. No cadence. Just words, delivered with clinical precision.

“Your performance this month was subpar at best. You did not meet one of yesterday’s deadline.”

My mind raced. Then I remembered — I hadn’t sent the daily summary. That stupid, repetitive task. Two to five sentences about what I did yesterday. I’d forgotten.

“You’re falling behind,” she continued. “If your high pay isn’t good enough to motivate you, then perhaps your life is.”

Her form shifted. Stretched. Became tall. Slender. Inhuman.

She stepped closer. Her face lowered toward mine.

“If things don’t change soon,” she whispered, “then we’ll have to make some tough decisions.”",1,1761287257.0,Nonsleep,0,1.0,False

Content warning for child neglect, child abuse, child abandonment, Family separation, assault possible stalking, possible kidnapping, depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts

So I (25f) have been having a shit time with my family for a good chunck of my life and i feel so fucking tired. That's get some characters in this story. Me, older half brother (27) Max, his wife (26) Kate,  Younger half brother, Steven (15) bio father (46) Craig. Others will come up but these are the main players. These names are fake.

Craig has never really been in me or Max's lives. I was raised by my mom's parents, and he was raised by his mom and step-dad  For most of our childhoods he fucked off to deal drugs and stick in his dick in whoever would let him. I was 10 when Steven was born, and i didnt meet him till he was 2. My grand mother hated Craig so I wasn't allowed to see either of my brothers from ages 8-12, or really egknowlodge their existence. After my grandmother passed, my grandfather got in touch with max's mom and i got to see my brother again.  And I basically joined their family. (Something im extremely thankfully for, I love them so much)
I really wanted to meet my little brother and see what the rest of my family was like. So two weekends a month, I got to hangout with my brothers and cousins.

Then Steven's mom... snapped, or something. When he was about 5, she packed all their shit,and completely disappeared. Her and Steven. Honestly this might have been a form of kidnapping but idk. I tried to keep tabs but I couldn't. I still kind of hate myself for not bejng able to find or talk to him then. And thats what's making this so much harder.

After that, Craig fucked off again. Me and max figured he didnt want to be a father until Steven came along. And now that he was gone, he didnt care anymore. 

In 2023, Steve was abandoned at a trouble youth shelter 10 hours away from the city me and Max live in. But this time, max was married to Kate and they just had their son. We tried to find a way to him but most of the roads were literally on fire. After about six months, Craig got custody of him. 
And I've tried to be active in Steven's life. I called once a week, tired to get him to play board games and read with me. Played Minecraft or fortnight once a week. And for the frist 8 months everything was good. Not great, Steven acted out but I wasn't surprised about that. I just wanted to be a supportive sister. 

Then, it started. Between August last year and last june. Steven has ran away 8 times, sometimes for a few hours, and once for close to a whole day. Stolen hundreds of dollars from Craig for video games, had the cops called over a dozen times for violent behaviour, either at home with Craig and his father David (67) or in public places, like school or the library. David is a drunk, who constantly yelled and threatened Steven, and i told them to get the fuck out, but Craig couldn't afford to live anywhere else.

Whenever I did our weekly calls or gaming, Craig and steven would began screaming at each other while I was on the phone, and i played middle man because im stupid and just wanted to play with my brother. Craig basically treated me like I was his covalent, and that I needed to do more. (I was working two jobs, living paycheck to paycheck) and my depression and anxiety began to get so much worse. I avoided my phone at all cost, I tired to set things up so we could hang but steven would always brush me off. Steven began hiding his own shit in the living room, just so he could keep playing fortnight. It was disgusting.

Then... the last two months happened. The fighting got worse, I began to have stress dreams and panic attacks whenever I say that Craig was calling me. Steven fully assaulted David and Craig.  They came out with scratches and a lot of blood. Then he punched a police officer when they came to break up a fight between him and craig. Craig and steven became homeless. They currently live with Craig's friends.
After a month of this kind of shit on a weekly basis, including ruining  birthday party (I just wanted to play a dnd campaign i had been working on for months) it somehow get worse. They got into anouther huge fight. And steven got arrested. That day i was finally having a good day. I was at work and I missed 3 calls from Craig, then max called on my break. Before he could tell me what happened, I told max that it would have to be the next day. That I didnt want my good day to be ruined. Max agreed to meet up for coffee the next day. Then I missed two more calls from criag. He texted, demandjng i call him. I sent back that i was at work, and that i needed one good day, and that i would talk to them tomorrow. He texted what happened to me a second later. I had a full panic attack in the back room of my work. And I blocked Craig after telling him he broke my boundaries of giving me one night. 
The cops put steven in a youth shelter with a court order to stay removed from criag for a week. Which Craig was pissed about.

Steven assaulted one of the workers, fully put them in the hospital. I got a phone call about that while at work..AGAIN. They needed to find a place for him to stay. At this point i was struggling to pay rent, and was boardline suicidal. So Max and Katie took him in. At frist it was great. He was going well with my niblings (3m and .5f) and Steven's acting out seemed to slow down. 
We went to court for the assault charges, still waiting on the full thing. I went to the last 2 hearings with a friend. Ever since I blocked cringe, he has been trying to corner me. Every chance he gets, he tried to get me alone. And he is always super pissed when I have backup. 

After the second hearing, steven went back to Craig. Which I wasn't thrilled about.

Until I found out way. 

Steven had destoried max and Katie's house. He smeared shit on the walls, destoryed the sofa with shit and moldy food. Basically destroyed Max's laptop and phone with porn apps. Scared Katie and the kids with a lot of yelling and throwing things. 

Now, in the last two weeks, steven has run off 2 more times, he blames everyone for everything. He lies about everything. And Craig is crying that no one helps him and he's trying to use me as his therapist. I'm so done. I just got a text about steven disappearing again and I hate myself for saying that I feel numb. I love my little brother I do, but in the last month I've had to seek emergency assistance. My world feels like its falling apart every second and I just cant hold it anymore. I want to just cut everyone off and hide away. Craig has shown up at Max's house multiple times to confront max about taking in steven. And I'm scared he is gonna show up at my house, or workplace. Frankly I'm scared of both of them. I know steven is just a kid, but he isn't my child. I love him but I don't think i can keep doing this. My friends say i should step back as far as possible, but i feel like a monster for even thinking about it. Steven has been failed but everyone, and i don't want to give up on him. But I'm just so damn tired.

So reddit, would I be overreacting if I just cut off my bio father and brother? Or would i just be cruel. I feel like im being ripped apart",1,1761287043.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

1oeqcr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1oeqcr5/brewing_kopi_techniques/,Brewing kopi techniques,"I'm looking for ways to improve brewing of kopi! Specifically I usually take Kopi C Kosong, I like the coffee made from nanyang style roasted beans (usually Robusta and a little Liberica) with evaporated milk and without sugar.

I've went through the kopi sock method, moka pot, pour over, hand drip, and finally concluded on the espresso machine being the best at making the smoothest cup of kopi. There's little to no acidity with the espresso machine compared to the other techniques.

Now the problem is how to maximise the caramel in my cup of kopi when I'm using the espresso machine. Currently I've only tried increasing the grind size from fine to coarse and found that coarse size produces a more fragrant and aromatic cup but less intense, not an issue as I can just do 2 batches with less water to increase the intensity, but I'm not getting the caramel from the beans into my cup.

I had my non hormonal copper IUD removed in early April- during my coil I had very heavy 3-4 day periods. Since removal I have 1 day of heavier bleeding (with clots) followed by 1/2 a day of light bleeding and a few days spotting. Little to no cramps, boob pain before. 

I’ve had all my tests done (hormones, thyroid, ultrasound etc all came back good.) my husbands swimmers were of optimal level. I had a slightly lower AMH for someone my age but Dr still happy with the number. She is having me get my tubes flushed and a 3d scan done to check for scarring or blockages that could be affecting implantation.  

I have been taking prenatal for 7 months, get weekly acupuncture, cut coffee and alc 3 months ago and we both exercise 3/4 times a week. 

Anyone else had this issue or managed to get pregnant. I’m kind of losing my mind in panic over here. ",1,1761286826.0,TryingForABaby,6,1.0,False

Back during our opening weeks, I worked a ton of hours but my check was short by over 30. I reported it and filled out the correction form, but they kept saying it would be “on my next few checks.” It never was.

Now, my most recent check is also short, and I didn’t get any of my tips for the past two weeks. I know for a fact there were tips. Management is barely at the stand, doesn’t answer texts, and never provides a breakdown of how tips are split or when we’re supposed to get them.

It’s starting to feel intentional. I have the email with my missing-hours form as proof.

What should I do next — contact corporate, or file a complaint with the Louisiana Department of Labor?
