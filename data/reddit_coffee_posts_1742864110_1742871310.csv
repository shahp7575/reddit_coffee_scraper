1jj9m6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1jj9m6g/i_work_night_shift_at_a_diner_in_floridathere_are/,I Work NIGHT SHIFT at a Diner in Florida...There are STRANGE RULES to follow !,"You ever get that feeling you’ve already made a mistake before you even clock in? Like your gut is trying to warn you, but your brain refuses to listen?

That was me on my first night at Sunny Oaks Diner.

The place sat on the side of a lonely highway, the kind of road where headlights felt rare and the silence stretched too long between passing cars. The diner’s neon sign flickered in and out, buzzing like it was struggling to stay alive. 

The parking lot was cracked, weeds pushing through the pavement, and the windows were fogged up from the inside, giving the whole place an eerie, lived-in feeling—like the building itself was breathing. A jukebox sat in the far corner, warbling out old songs, but no one had touched it. It was just playing on its own.

I hadn’t even stepped inside yet, and already, I felt like I didn’t belong.

The manager, Reggie, didn’t bother to meet me in person. No handshake, no ""Welcome to the team,"" not even a quick phone call. Instead, my phone buzzed, and I saw a message waiting for me.

**REGGIE:** ""Check the dashboard before you clock in. Password is the same for all new hires.""

That was it. Nothing else.

No instructions. No small talk. No “let me show you around.” Just a text that felt more like a command than a welcome. Something about it rubbed me the wrong way, but I sighed, shoved my phone in my pocket, and pushed open the diner’s front door.

The inside wasn’t any better. The air smelled like old coffee and burnt toast, the kind of scent that had been baked into the walls over years of neglect. The counter was lined with red leather stools, cracked at the seams, and the booths had that sticky, worn-down feel like they’d seen decades of customers come and go.

Behind the counter sat the old computer. It was one of those ancient models with a bulky monitor, the plastic casing yellowed from time. When I jiggled the mouse, the thing groaned like I had just woken it up from a deep sleep. The screen flickered to life, showing a basic login page—plain blue background, ugly blocky font.

Four tabs.

* **Schedules**  
* **Payroll**  
* **Training Videos**  
* **NIGHT SHIFT PROTOCOL – READ BEFORE CLOCKING IN**  

That last one made my stomach twist.

I hesitated, then, out of curiosity, clicked **""Forgot Password.""**

A single security question popped up: **""What’s the secret ingredient in our famous pie?""**

I blinked. I had no idea. I hadn’t even seen the menu yet. But this was Florida, and if there was one thing Florida loved, it was key lime pie.

So I typed: **Key lime.**

The screen refreshed.

**Access granted.**

That was weird. Too easy.

Inside, the dashboard was a mess—broken links, old employee announcements from years ago, and a handful of outdated memos. Nothing useful. But my eyes locked onto the Night Shift Protocol PDF.

I clicked it open.

At first, it seemed normal. The usual corporate nonsense about keeping the place clean, being polite to customers, and making sure the cash register was balanced. But then, as I scrolled down, something changed.

The rules at the bottom weren’t normal.

They weren’t even close.

They were written in **bold.**

1. **Always keep the coffee pot full.** Even if no one’s drinking. If it runs dry, refill it immediately.  
2. **If a man in a blue suit walks in, take his order, but never look him in the eyes.** He will sit at the booth in the back.  
3. **You may see someone who looks exactly like you sitting at the counter. Ignore them.** Do not acknowledge their presence.  
4. **At exactly 4:14 AM, go to the walk-in freezer and knock three times.** If you hear knocking back, leave the diner immediately and do not return until 5:00 AM.  
5. **If a woman in a red dress asks for ""yesterday’s special,"" tell her, ""We’re all out.""** No matter what she says, do not serve her.  
6. **Under no circumstances should you touch Table 6’s silverware.**  

My fingers tightened on the mouse.

At the very bottom, barely readable, was one last line in faded gray text: *""Failure to follow protocol will result in immediate termination.""*

Somehow, I didn’t think they meant getting fired.

The first couple of hours were slow. The kind of slow where every minute stretched too long, where silence wasn’t just silence—it was something heavy, pressing down on me.

I did what I could to stay busy. Wiping down the counter. Refilling salt shakers. Rearranging the napkin dispensers like that somehow mattered. Anything to keep my mind from wandering too far into the rules I’d read. But no matter what I did, the feeling sat in my gut like a warning—something was off in this place.

The diner smelled like old grease and burnt coffee, the usual scents of a place like this, but underneath it, there was something else. Something sour. Like milk gone bad, or something left to rot where no one could see it. The scent clung to the back of my throat, and the more I noticed it, the harder it was to ignore.

Then, at **1:34 AM**, the doorbell jingled.

I froze.

A man in a blue suit stepped inside.

My breath caught in my chest. **Rule #2.**

**If a man in a blue suit walks in, take his order, but never look him in the eyes.** He will sit at the booth in the back.

His movements were slow—too slow. Like every step was deliberate, measured. He didn’t glance around, didn’t acknowledge me, didn’t even seem to notice the empty diner. He just moved, silent and sure, toward the booth in the back.

I kept my head down. My notepad felt slippery in my hand, and I gripped it tighter. My feet carried me forward on autopilot, my pulse loud in my ears.

Don’t look at him. Just take his order.

I stopped at his table, eyes glued to the blank page of my notepad. My voice came out steadier than I felt.

**""What can I get you?""**

For a second, there was nothing. No response. Just the hum of the jukebox playing some forgotten song.

Then, he spoke.

**""Coffee.""**

It wasn’t the word that unsettled me. It was the way he said it. His voice was wrong—too smooth, like a recording played a little too slow, like something trying too hard to sound normal but not quite getting there.

My hands shook as I grabbed the pot. I poured the coffee carefully, keeping my head down, forcing my breathing to stay even. But when I slid the cup across the table, my hand accidentally brushed his.

A deep, icy chill shot up my arm.

It wasn’t like touching cold skin. It was worse. Like touching something that had never been alive in the first place.

A low chuckle.

**""Good boy,""** he murmured.

My stomach turned. I swallowed hard, resisting the urge to run.

He chuckled again, this time softer. **""See you tomorrow, kid.""**

I didn’t know why, but that laugh made my skin crawl. It was the kind of sound that stuck to your ribs, something your body recognized as wrong even if your brain couldn’t explain why.

I turned away fast, desperate to put space between us. But as I moved, my eyes caught the reflection in the napkin dispenser.

His mouth stretched too wide.

Not in a smile. Not in anything human.

Like his skin didn’t fit right. His teeth—too white, too sharp—flashed in the dim light.

I squeezed my eyes shut and forced myself to keep walking. My hands still trembled as I reached the counter. I busied myself wiping an already-clean spot, anything to keep from looking back.

I didn’t hear him leave. But when I finally dared to glance at the booth—

He was gone.

Just the faint wisp of steam curling from the untouched cup of coffee.

It was **2:07 AM.**

The clock on the wall ticked forward, and I realized something.

If that was only my first customer, how the hell was I supposed to make it through the rest of my shift?

My chest felt tight, my mind racing to find some kind of normal in this nightmare. 

But then—I heard **Footsteps.**

Someone sat at the counter.

I turned, and my stomach plummeted.

It was me.

Same uniform. Same posture. Same exhausted expression.

But one difference—he was **grinning.**

My fingers dug into the counter. My heart pounded against my ribs. 

**Rule #3—You may see someone who looks exactly like you sitting at the counter. Ignore them.** Do not acknowledge their presence.

I forced my head down, eyes on the coffee pot, hands moving like I was focused on anything else. Like I hadn’t seen what was sitting just feet away.

But I **felt** him.

His eyes on me.

That grin stretching wider, like he knew something I didn’t.

The diner’s silence became unbearable, every second dragging longer. Then, out of nowhere—

It spoke in **my voice.**

**""You should sit down, man. You look tired.""**

It was my voice. But it wasn’t **me.**

I clenched my jaw and scrubbed harder at the counter, pretending. Ignoring. Following the rules.

A pause. Then—

**Drumming.**

The other me tapped his fingers against the countertop in a slow, steady rhythm.

**""You think the rules tell you everything?""** he asked.

I gritted my teeth. Said nothing.

The drumming continued.

**""You’re missing one.""** It said again.

A cold weight settled in my chest.

I stared at the coffee pot, my reflection warped in the glass. My own expression looked wrong—like something beneath the surface had cracked just a little.

I couldn’t let this get to me. I wouldn’t.

I took a breath, gripped the edge of the counter, and I turned away. 

But, When I looked back—

**He was gone.**

Nothing left.

Nothing except a half-empty cup of coffee sitting in front of the abandoned stool.

I never poured that.

**Missing one?**

What the hell did that mean?

The other me—whatever it was—hadn’t said anything else, just left me with that cryptic warning. But the way he said it… it didn’t feel like a joke. It felt like a clue. Or maybe a threat.

I stood behind the counter, gripping it so hard my knuckles ached. My mind spun, trying to make sense of what had just happened. The fork in the pancake, the empty coffee cup, the laugh that still rang in my ears.

This place wasn’t just haunted. It was playing by some kind of rules, and I had no idea who—or **what**—was making them.

Then, **she** walked in.

At first glance, she looked normal enough. Dark hair, sharp eyes, a red dress that fit like she belonged somewhere better than a greasy highway diner. But the second she stepped through the door, the air shifted.

It was subtle—like the temperature dropped just a little, like the diner **recognized** her.

She moved smoothly, no hesitation, sliding into a booth like she’d been here a thousand times before. Then, she smiled.

**""I'll have yesterday's special.""** She said,

My throat went dry.

**Rule #5.**

The words burned in my brain. **If a woman in a red dress asks for ""yesterday’s special,"" tell her, ""We’re all out."" No matter what she says, do not serve her.**

I swallowed hard.

**""We're all out.""** I said**.**

It barely came out above a whisper, but I got the words out.

Her smile didn’t move. It stayed fixed in place, like it had been painted on. Her fingers tapped lazily against the table, the rhythm slow and deliberate.

**""Are you sure?""** She asked again.

Her voice was warm, coaxing. Like she was giving me a chance to change my mind. Like she was used to people **changing their minds.**

I forced myself to breathe.

**""Yeah,""** I said, a little stronger this time. **""We don’t serve that anymore.""**

The air in the diner felt heavy, like the walls were pressing in.

For a split second, something in her expression **shifted.** Not anger, not frustration—something deeper. Something **calculating.**

Like she was trying to decide what I was worth.

Her eyes darkened just a little, and for a terrifying moment, I thought she’d lunge across the table. But then, just as quickly, she leaned back, exhaling through her nose like she’d just lost a bet.

Her nails tapped against the tabletop again.

**""You’re smarter than the last one.""** she said.

Then she stood.

No argument. No second attempt.

She just walked out.

The door swung shut behind her, and just like that, the diner **felt normal again.** Or at least, as normal as it ever got.

I let out a shaky breath, running a hand through my hair.

**""Oh my damn God,""** I muttered under my breath.

What the hell was that?

**Did they think like us?**

That was the part that scared me the most. The guy in the suit, the other me, the woman in the red dress—they weren’t just mindless things following some supernatural script. They were **watching.** Learning. Testing me.

And I had no idea what happened to the people who failed.

Suddenly, The doorbell jingled again, snapping me out of my spiraling thoughts.

A couple walked in, laughing softly as they took a seat at **Table 6.**

I stiffened.

**Rule #6.** **Under no circumstances should you touch Table 6’s silverware.**

But I couldn’t **stop** them from using it. They were customers. Just a regular couple—probably on a late-night road trip, stopping for a bite before heading back to whatever normal life they had.

I forced myself to move, to act natural. I took their order, brought them their food, and watched as they ate, completely unaware that anything was wrong.

When they finished, they left cash on the table and walked out, still chatting, still smiling.

It should’ve been fine. It should’ve been **over.**

But when I walked over to clear their plates, my stomach dropped.

One of the forks was **missing.**

I checked under the table, the seats, even inside the napkin dispenser. Nothing.

Then, as I turned back toward the counter—

I **saw it.**

A plate sat on the counter that hadn’t been there before.

A single pancake, perfectly round, like it had just been placed fresh from the griddle.

And stabbed right into the center—

Was the missing fork.

I froze.

My mouth went dry.

Slowly, **too slowly,** my gaze drifted up—

And I saw him.

The man in the blue suit.

Sitting across from the plate. Fingers tapping against the table, that slow, deliberate rhythm that I was starting to hate.

He wasn’t smiling.

**""You should really be more careful,""** he said.

My hands felt like ice. My heart pounded so hard I could feel it in my **teeth.**

**""Breaking the rules has consequences,""** he warned me again.

I didn’t move. I didn’t even **breathe.**

The jukebox stopped playing.

The hum of the old lights overhead buzzed louder.

And then—

**Everything went dark.**

For five long, suffocating seconds, the diner was pitch black.

No sounds. No movement. Just the kind of stillness that presses in on your ribs, makes you feel like something’s waiting just inches away, watching, reaching—

Then—

The lights flickered back on.

The man in the suit was **gone.**

The diner was **empty.**

Except for the plate.

The pancake was gone.

But the fork was still there—

**Driven into the table.**

Like someone had **stabbed it in hard.**

By now, nothing could surprise me.

Or so I thought.

The night had been a blur of rules and warnings, of people who weren’t people, of moments that made my skin crawl. But the worst part wasn’t what I had seen—it was knowing that something else was coming.

Something **always** came next.

At exactly **4:14 AM,** my stomach twisted.

I had almost forgotten **Rule #4.**

**At exactly 4:14 AM, go to the walk-in freezer and knock three times. If you hear knocking back, leave the diner immediately and do not return until 5:00 AM.**

I glanced at the clock, pulse quickening.

**4:14 AM.**

I swallowed hard and forced my legs to move, pushing past the swinging kitchen doors. The freezer stood at the back, its heavy steel door shut tight. My breath fogged in the cold air as I stepped closer, every instinct screaming at me to turn around.

Then, my phone buzzed.

The screen lit up with a **dashboard notification.**

**""Follow the protocol.""**

I exhaled sharply, hand tightening around my phone.

I lifted my fist.

I knocked three times.

Silence.

For a second, I thought maybe—just **maybe**—nothing would happen. Maybe the rules were just there to mess with me, some kind of cruel initiation.

Then—**Knock. Knock. Knock.**

Three Knocks, From the **inside.**

I stumbled back so fast I nearly lost my footing, my shoes slipping against the cold tile. My heartbeat thundered in my ears. My fingers twitched around my keys.

**The rule said to leave.**

I didn’t think. I just moved.

Bolting through the kitchen, I shoved open the back door and ran straight to my car. My hands were shaking so badly I fumbled the keys twice before finally jamming them into the ignition.

I didn’t drive.

I just **sat there,** gripping the wheel, waiting.

From the parking lot, I could see the diner, its windows glowing in the darkness. Everything looked **normal.**

But the freezer door—

It was open.

A figure shifted inside, barely visible through the gap.

Then, **he stepped out.**

My stomach twisted into a knot so tight I thought I’d be sick.

It was **me.**

Standing behind the counter.

Smiling.

His lips moved.

I couldn’t hear him, but I knew what he was saying.

**""You're still missing one.""**

Then, every single light in the diner **went out.**

I shouldn’t have gone back inside.

But I had to.

The moment the clock hit **5:00**, I took a deep breath and forced myself out of the car. My footsteps felt too loud as I crossed the parking lot, the neon sign above flickering weakly.

The diner was silent.

Too silent.

The door creaked as I stepped inside. The air smelled the same—burnt coffee and old grease—but something **felt** different.

Like the place was holding its breath.

I checked everything.

The man in the suit? Gone.

The other me? Gone.

The freezer door? Shut.

I should have felt relieved. I **wanted** to feel relieved. But my skin prickled with something I couldn’t shake.

Something **was wrong.**

I walked behind the counter, trying to shake off the unease. My fingers grazed the coffee pot—still warm. The counter, still wiped clean. Everything **looked** normal.

But, Then—

I heard… **Scratching.**

I froze.

The sound was faint, almost too quiet to notice.

**Scritch. Scritch. Scritch.**

It was coming from the kitchen.

I turned slowly, every muscle in my body tensed.

**This wasn’t on the rules list.**

My breath hitched as I crept forward, following the sound. The closer I got, the more distinct it became—like fingernails dragging against wood.

It was coming from the **supply closet.**

I stopped in front of the door, pulse hammering against my ribs.

The scratching paused.

Then, just as I reached for the handle—

**BANG.**

Something **slammed** against the inside of the door.

I staggered back, my heart in my throat.

And then— A voice came.

**""Let me out.""** 

It wasn’t loud.

It wasn’t frantic.

It was **calm.** Steady.

Like it knew I was standing there, frozen in fear.

I couldn’t move.

**""Let me out.""** It said Again.

No.

No, this wasn’t **right.**

I reached for the handle before my brain could stop me, fingers brushing against the cold metal—

**Wait.**

**This wasn’t in the rules.**

My blood turned to ice.

I yanked my hand back like I had been burned.

I had followed the rules all night. I had listened. Obeyed. But this?

**This wasn’t on the list.**

Which meant I had no idea what would happen if I broke it.

The scratching started again.

I swallowed my fear, took a step back, and—

**SLAMMED THE DOOR SHUT.**

With shaking hands, I twisted the lock.

Then I ran.

I grabbed my phone, fingers trembling as I pulled up the dashboard. My breath came in short, uneven gasps as I clicked into the rules.

I forced myself to type.

**Rule #7. If you hear scratching from the kitchen closet, DO NOT OPEN IT. Lock the door and leave immediately.**

The second I hit **save,** the screen **glitched.**

For half a second, the text warped—letters stretching, distorting, twisting into something unreadable.

Suddenly—I heard A breath, **Right behind me.**

A whisper brushed against my ear. 

**""Too late.""**

Ice crawled up my spine.

**A hand grabbed my wrist.**

Cold. Too cold.

I **screamed.**

I don’t remember how I got out.

One second, I was inside the diner, something cold wrapping around my wrist, whispering in my ear. The next—

I was outside.

Gasping for air.

The pavement was rough beneath me, my knees scraped raw like I had fallen. My hands **burned,** a sharp, stinging heat, like I had pressed them against a stove. I looked down, expecting blisters, expecting **something.**

But there was nothing.

The diner sat in front of me, dark and silent, like it had never been open in the first place.

The neon sign still flickered weakly, buzzing in the early morning quiet. But inside, the windows were pitch black, the kind of darkness that felt **full.**

Like something was watching from the other side.

I forced myself to my feet, legs shaking beneath me. My breathing was uneven, my body still locked in that fight-or-flight haze.

The door was shut.

The silverware?

**Back on the table.**

Neatly arranged, as if nothing had ever happened.

Like the diner had reset itself.

Like it was waiting for the next shift.

My phone buzzed.

I pulled it out with numb fingers, my pulse spiking as I saw the notification.

**DASHBOARD ERROR.**

I opened the app, stomach twisting.

The rules were **locked.**

I tried to tap them, to edit, to add more—

**Nothing.**

I couldn’t change them.

Couldn’t add anything else.

The rule about the **scratching closet** was the last one I’d ever be able to write.

And something about that sent a fresh wave of terror down my spine.

It meant the game wasn’t over.

It meant someone else would take my place.

I never went back.

I didn’t quit. Didn’t send a message. Didn’t **acknowledge** Sunny Oaks Diner in any way. I just… disappeared.

For a while, I convinced myself it was over.

Then, the next morning, my phone chimed.

A new email.

My chest tightened as I saw the sender.

**REGGIE.**

My finger hovered over the screen before I finally opened it.

**""You lasted longer than most. Hope you wrote everything down. The next guy will need it.""**

That was it.

No apology. No explanation. Just those cold, matter-of-fact words.

Like this was **normal.**

Like I was just another name on a long list of people who had tried and **failed.**

I stared at the email for a long time before finally **deleting it.**

I tried to delete the memories, too.

Tried to convince myself it was just a nightmare, a bad dream I couldn’t shake.

But sometimes—late at night, when the world is quiet and I’m alone with my thoughts—

I still **feel** it.

That cold grip around my wrist.

The whisper against my ear.

The weight of **something** standing just out of sight, watching.

I don’t know who—or what—is running that diner now.

And I don’t want to know.

But if you ever find yourself driving down a lonely stretch of highway and see a flickering neon sign for **Sunny Oaks Diner?**

Do yourself a favor.

I have obsessed over this school to an unhealthy degree. I have stared at campus photos until my pupils dilated. I have whispered “I am a HARVARD student” into my goddamn pillow at 3 AM like a lunatic. I have gaslit, girlbossed, and gatekept my own f*cking reality into submission.

Do you understand? THE UNIVERSE HAS NO CHOICE.

I have sacrificed my sanity for this application. My essays? Pulitzer-worthy. My extracurriculars? Built different. My GPA? So high it’s probably illegal in several states. My rec letters? They don’t even recommend me—they demand my admission.

AND IF THEY REJECT ME???
NO. THEY CAN’T.
I refuse to accept a reality where I don’t get in. If an admissions officer even thinks about denying me, their WiFi will drop. Their entire CRM system will get hit with a fatal error. Their office printer will burst into flames.

1jj9cyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jj9cyr/girls_trip_ends_friendship_long_post_alert/,"Girls Trip Ends Friendship, 🚨long post alert🚨","   For Veterans Day weekend, I organized a girls trip to Washington DC for myself and three girlfriends. All of us attended law school together and three of them recently graduated while I was finishing my last year. I emphasized that the trip to DC would be for us to visit the government buildings and such as aspiring legal professionals. 

Background: The four of us have been doing girls trips since law school started and we each take turns planning a trip. This was my first trip to plan. I planned a low-cost weekend (visiting government buildings and Smithsonian museums is free) because I was still a student and the other three had just started their careers. When the other girls planned trips, they sent informational emails to all of us so we knew what we were doing that weekend. I sent a long text message with info about what I had scheduled AND what to wear/expect at these places. 

We are a group of four. After our first year of law school, two of the four girls began dating. Myself and the other girl were of course extremely supportive of this relationship but we also were aware that the new dynamic between the two of them would affect the dynamic in the friend group from time to time. This wasn't something that had been discussed as I assumed that since we were all adults and educated on how to best handle conflict (as young lawyers) that personal/group conflict would be handled appropriately. 

For storytelling ease, I will assign everyone a letter - A & B are the two that are dating, C is the other friend, and I'll refer to myself as ""me, I, or myself"". 

The Trip: I had booked a hotel suite with three bedrooms in it (which was cheaper to split than getting two separate rooms). Three of us arrived before the evening. Girl A said she had picked out a restaurant she would like us to go to for dinner and that B would be arriving later than originally planned (planned time was 7pm but new time was 9pm). I had said in my info text that I had a dinner place picked out and A didn't ask if changing that plan would be alright, she just assumed it would be (not a big issue, but a small detail that seemed weird to me). After dinner, she joked that she hadn't even read my informational message and didn't know what we was planned for the weekend. I just laughed because I assumed she would read the message once we got back to the room or something but never did. 

B finally arrived at 11pm (she just didn't leave her apartment in Pittsburgh until after she was supposed to have arrived at the hotel at 7pm) and tells everyone that she wants to go to the clubs. This isn't something I had planned, but I had told everyone that if they want to go out at night, we can, I just won't be the one planning it. A & B find clubs and bars in downtown DC to they want to check out. We get dressed, go out, and have fun. We get back to the hotel around 4am and everyone is really tired. I told them that we can cancel the brunch I had planned in the morning but that I had scheduled a private tour of the Capitol building with a legislative aid at 1:00pm the next day and for professional reasons would like to keep that appointment. Everyone agreed they would be ready for the Capitol tour on time. 

The next day, I wake up early to get everyone breakfast sandwiches to go so we can make it to the tour on time without being hungry. C wakes up in time to get ready and eat. A & B do not wake up. I tried calling both A & B and texted multiple times. C knocked on their bedroom door twice and tried talking through the door to see if they respond. Remember, we're in a hotel suite that has three bedrooms inside it so we can open the door to their bedroom if we want to. However, C and I agree that since A & B are a couple, it would be inappropriate to enter their room while they're sleeping if it's not an emergency (especially since they live in different states after graduating law school and haven't seen each other in 2 weeks at that point). So C and I go to the tour on our own. I'm annoyed but I'm not angry. I expect that when they wake up, they'll apologize and meet up with us. 

When the tour starts, B calls me but I don't answer because I'm on the tour. She sends a text to the group message saying, ""why didn't you knock on our door?"" I'm already annoyed that they slept in an I'm getting more annoyed at the text that accuses C and I of not being thoughtful enough to attempt to wake A & B (and I didn't get even a half hearted ""sorry, did you try waking us""?). I responded in a text that we did knock on their door twice. I had thought that now that I established that we did try to wake them, that I would get an apology, but instead B's reply was, ""okay no stress"". I took this as ""no stress that you didn't wake us, we're not upset about it."" I felt that was inappropriate and my annoyance began to turn into irritation because of this. I complained to C that I was irritated that B made it sound like C and I were the ones who should feel guilty for A & B not waking up. 

Two hours later, A & B arrive at the Capitol building and I'm still disappointed but hoping for an apology. At this point, C had told me that she was too tired to do the activities I had planned for the second part of the day (walking the national mall). This was understandable as C had broken her ankle a year ago and still needs frequent breaks from walking for long periods. C said she was going to go back to the hotel. When A & B arrive, I'm hoping to get my apology and then move on and spend the second half of the day with A & B while C rests. But A & B show up and the first thing A says is, ""why didn't you guys come in our room and wake us up?"" I don't answer this question because I think it's ridiculous that we're debating who is responsible for A & B oversleeping (in case you're wondering, no, neither of them set an alarm, even though I confirmed the time of the tour before going to sleep the night before). I let C answer that question while I look at the ground, clearly disappointed that A & B overslept and C is going back to the hotel. B then asks me why I look disappointed (she frequently has taken issue with the fact that my emotions are visible on my face- she likes when my positive emotions are visible on my face and for some reason is offended when negative emotions are visible on my face whether or not her actions caused me to feel negative emotions). I say, (in admittedly angry tone) that the things I planned for the weekend are getting canceled and it feels like the weekend is ruined. And I say that I'm just going to go back to the hotel with C. No one responds to this and I just walk away to order an Uber. A & B go to visit the buildings they missed this morning while C and I go back to the hotel. In the Uber ride, I'm complaining to C about how A & B always have to hijack group events (i.e. we always have to do what they want on their schedule) and that I've never really felt like part of the group (because A, B, and C became friends at the beginning of our first year of law school while I didn't become friends with them until the end of the first year of law school). These were genuine thoughts and feelings that I've had for a while and not just something I said because I was angry. I told C these feelings in confidence while I was angry, but I could tell that this made C uncomfortable that I was expressing negative emotions about our other two friends. 

The Conflict: C and I get back to the hotel room and I decide that A & B will never apologize and its no use continuing to be upset about their lack of respect for my weekend plans. I send B a text saying that I'll be less emotional once I've had a nap (because I was so tired from staying up late at clubs the night before and traveling the day before that) and that I'll be ready for dinner when everyone else is. B replies that they'll be back soon to get ready for dinner. 

When A & B do return, I put on a fake smile because I'm trying to let it go. Well, A & B tell me that before we go to dinner, all four of us need to talk about my being upset and that I need to apologize for being upset. C, who agreed with me during the Capitol that A & B should have set alarms and should apologize for oversleeping, was now not on my side presumably because she didn't like that I said A & B hijack events and that I've never really felt like part of the group. B said I need to apologize for saying that I felt like the weekend was ruined. I didn't believe I needed to apologize for saying how I felt and that I felt I was owed an apology because I had planned only one thing at a particular time with a Senator's aide and that I wanted all of us to be there for it. I then compared my comment about the ruined weekend to B's comment to me during the girls trip she planned where she said that because I had a panic attack at a club and just sat down instead of partying, it ruined her day. She said she doesn't see how the two situations and the two comments about ""ruined"" trips were the same. 

They said C and I should have tried harder to wake them by walking into their room and physically waking them up. B said, ""You know I'm late all the time so you should have expected this"" and that because I should have expected it I should have tried harder to wake them. A said, ""If it was really important to you that we be on that tour, you would have come into our room and woken us up"". I felt like those two statements were gaslighting statements and it was the moment in the conversation that I clearly remember any love or affection I had for B (who I was closer to than A) completely leave my body and I determined this friendship was no longer going to work out. C then said I ruined her day by coming back to the hotel with her and cancelling the second part of the day that I had planned. I challenged C on this because she said she wasn't going to be participating in the afternoon activities and she said that she would have just rented an electric bike, which is a valid point but she wanted to come back to the hotel and rest before renting a bike anyway. This is why I believe she chose sides due to my comments in the Uber ride back to the hotel. I told A & B that I don't feel comfortable walking in on a couple sleeping together if it's not an emergency (and attending a tour to avoid pissing off your friend who planned the tour is not an emergency). They said they don't care that I would feel uncomfortable doing it because I should push through my uncomfortableness if I really wanted them there. I also said I didn't know that that was something THEY would comfortable with someone doing and they said I should have known that they would be okay with it (even though this is never a conversation that has come up before so idk how I was supposed to know that). I said it would be different if they weren't a couple but that walking in on a couple sleeping together is inappropriate. B then said, ""i don't know what kind of relationship you think this is"". I didn't know how to reply to that so I just said I'm going to my room to sleep. If we aren't going to agree, then why can't we just agree to disagree and let it go? They said that we can't end the conversation until we're all on the same page (which is their page). But I walked away and C says, ""Idk why you're acting like this"". 

To my recollection, none of us were yelling at each other, raising voices, or being mean. However, I worry that because all the blame for this conflict has been placed on me by A, B & C that I did yell or scream or something and I just blacked it out. The three of them went to dinner without me and spent the rest of the night together. They asked me to come to dinner but I declined because I was too tired and ""too emotional"". 

The rest of the trip: There was one day left on the trip and then everyone was leaving really early the following morning. On the last day, I woke up really early (because I usually do) and composed an apology text because the bigger person always apologizes first, even if they don't think they need to. I realized that if I wanted an apology for something they didn't think should have hurt my feelings, then I should be able to apologize for something that I didn't think should have hurt their feelings. Because emotions are subjective and a good person always apologizes when they realize they've caused harm no matter how small. No reply to the apology text, not even an apology in return. 

I stay in my room until the absolute last minute when everyone is ready to go because I don't feel like socializing. I have a plan for the day but not a time for things (the Capitol building tour with the legislative aide was the only timed activity I planned). I let them take the lead on the order we visit places that I had picked out for the day. In the Uber ride from the hotel to our first destination, A is talking about how her nephew really likes Snoop Dog's kids album and especially the affirmations song that goes, ""my feelings matter, my feelings matter"". She kept singing that line over and over again in the car and describing how her nephew dances to it. It was a slap in the face because the night before I had been told by them that my feelings don't matter (i.e. Saying I FEEL the weekend was ruined required an apology according to them and me being UNCOMFORTABLE was not an excuse to not open their door and physically wake them). When we stopped for coffee, B asked me why I was being so quiet on the car ride. I just said I was tired because I think it's obvious why I'm still upset and she probably is aware of it. 

We awkwardly go through our day together and I barely speak unless I have something meaningful to say (usually I'm very talkative and say what comes to my mind). C keeps condescendingly mentioning that we need to keep on schedule (even though I had no timed schedule for the day) and keeps referring back to the text I sent before we go to the next planned activity. It was clear that all three of them missed the point of my anger. Instead of recognizing that I felt disrespected and wanted an apology, they think that I'm upset because we didn't follow my schedule exactly as planned. 

We all leave the next morning and I'm still upset because I'm confused about why this was blown out of proportion. I recognize that my response to their disrespect was not the most mature but I'm surprised that it even got that far. I'm confused why we couldn't agree to disagree. I'm confused why giving an apology is so difficult. And I'm sad that I lost three friends. It occurred to me that C was thrust into the middle of all of this and even though I don't like that she chose sides, I don't necessarily blame her and wanted to apologize to her. So I sent her a long email because I didn't want her to feeling pressured to reply to a text quickly. I explained that while I felt gaslighted by A & B and don't want to be friends with them anymore, that I was sorry for putting her in the middle of the disagreement and wanted to remain friends with her. I did acknowledge, however, that because A is C's best friend and A and C live in the same city, that it may be difficult for her to remain friends with me (because I know A holds insane grudges). She never replied to the email and I haven't talked to any of them since. 

Who is wrong here? Am I wrong for expressing my hurt feelings and asking for an apology? Are A & B wrong for not setting an alarm and then not apologizing for oversleeping? Are all of us wrong? ",2,1742870418.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Not on my watch, Karen.","My local Barnes & Noble in Texas  is not that large. The cafe has seating for about 30, tops...most of those at 6-7 tables away from the window. we also only have one counter, across from the barista station, with seats for 4. The 'counter' is immediately to the left as soon as you enter the cafe area. These are close to the window and are coveted seats if you can't get a table alongside the window. Being a B & N nerd, i always know when to show up and get a good table close to the windows. 

I managed to snag one of those tables (as always), with the window to my right, the 'counter seating' directly in front of me, and the register/serving area to my right. I was happy to get a window-side table, as i often cannot, and not have to sit at the counter with it's 4 stools. As i was enjoying my coffee and magazines, i noticed that the 4 stools at the counter were only half-occupied. There was a tallish 50-something blonde and her 17-ish daughter 2 stools away. Trouble is, they had plopped their clothing/backpacks on the OTHER STOOLS, as to take up 4 stools instead of the 2 they needed. The daughter was perusing the store and wasn't even using her seat, but Mom had them 'taken' with backpacks and a purse to 'save them'. I actually saw a couple come in and were denied a seat at the counter due to mom telling the 'those seats were occupied'. When daughter eventually  returned, Mom seemed to celebrate her 'victory' with her. 

After the second time i saw this happen, I put away my magazines and decided to have some fun. When a third (fatter, Rednecky) couple came in and were driven away from Karen, I smiled and waved them over. I offered them my seat (I was taking up one seat at a 4-man table), and after they sat, i explained to them what was going on. They were a little put out by being denied a decent seat at the counter, and took my advice. They walked the 10 feet back to the counter and pulled out the stools, only to be told my Mom that those 'seats were taken'. They plopped their asses in the seats anyways, and (I'm assuming) told Mom they'd be **happy to move when the owner returned**. Mom indignantly took the backpacks/purse from the left two seats and pouted for awhile, looking around. 

Daughter came back and a smallish argument ensued, the Rednecky couple offering to move when others came by to reclaim their other seats. Mom was very put out and was angry that her scam was not working. She wound up putting both backpacks and daughters purse on her two seats, and the Redneck couple ignored her and enjoyed their coffees. Naturally, she left soon after. Redneck couple turned around and gave me a smile and a thumbs up. i responded with devil horns.",19,1742870385.0,pettyrevenge,6,0.7,False

As Valentine’s Day approaches, many people look for charming ways to express their love and affection. Farmhouse Valentine decor offers a delightful mix of rustic charm and romantic touches, perfect for creating a warm atmosphere in your home. The simplicity and coziness of farmhouse styles make them an ideal backdrop for celebrating love and togetherness.

One of the most popular elements of farmhouse Valentine decor includes rustic hearts made from wood or metal. These materials not only enhance the farmhouse aesthetic but also bring a heartfelt sentiment to your spaces. Hang wooden heart wall art or display galvanized metal hearts on your mantel to create an inviting focal point.

Another essential feature is the use of natural elements. Incorporating fresh flowers, like roses or wildflowers, into homemade centerpieces can add a vibrant touch. Pair them with vintage mason jars or rustic vases for an effortless, love-filled vignette. Additionally, consider using burlap table runners or lace accents to introduce texture that complements the farmhouse style.

For those looking to add a whimsical touch, consider incorporating seasonal throw pillows with love-themed quotes or patterns. Soft fabrics like cotton or linen in muted tones or plaid designs can elevate your seating areas while maintaining the comfort associated with farmhouse decor.

Utilizing candles is an effective way to enhance the romantic ambiance. Choose vintage candle holders or lanterns to add a soft glow to your dining table or coffee nook, creating an intimate setting for your Valentine’s celebrations. The flickering light paired with earthy tones will evoke warmth and sweetness, essential for a memorable occasion.

How do I approach this?","Last November, I left my job due to mental strain. My husband and I have been married for two years, and at first, he was completely supportive, telling me to take a few months to recover before thinking about work again.

Over time, I found my passion in volunteering within my community. It’s given me a sense of purpose and fulfillment that my old job never did. After a lot of reflection, I decided that I wouldn’t be returning to a traditional paid job—I wanted to commit to this full-time.

When I told my husband, his reaction surprised me. He’s very analytical (he handles all our finances using his detailed spreadsheets), and he immediately started talking about how our budget would have to “drastically” change. My income wasn’t huge—only about $2,500 a month—but he insisted this loss meant serious cutbacks. However, when I looked at what changed, I noticed that all of MY personal spending categories took the hit.
	•	My personal care budget was cut from $300 to $100
	•	My “fun money” for grabbing coffee/lunch with friends dropped to $150
	•	Our joint eating-out budget was reduced, and he said I would need to cook an extra meal each week
	•	I no longer have a travel budget. I usually fly Frontier once a month for a weekend to visit out of state family and friends. 

Thankfully he didn't cut my student loan payments! When I asked why everything that affected me was slashed, he just pointed at his spreadsheet and told me “this is what makes sense and is fair.” I asked him to explain in simple terms, but he refuses. He also refuses to consider using any of our very large savings account (which we built together) to supplement our income in the meantime, saying that we agreed it was strictly for a house and not for me to “take a sabbatical"" and we may not got our goal date.

I told him this felt like financial control or even financial abuse. His response? That I was being irresponsible, and this was just “math.”

I don’t know what to do. I feel like my financial autonomy has been taken away just because I chose something that makes me happy. How do I approach this?",0,1742869778.0,relationship_advice,33,0.5,False

If you don’t remember, I’m on a relief team that just wrapped up our first bout of Ward 2 training. That culminated on Friday in the form of a practical exam that consisted of handling an inmate called Baby Freak for four hours.



It was a disaster.



I don’t know how to describe Baby Freak. They’re basically a deceptively adorable and thoroughly terrifying real-life cartoon. Their head is too large for their body. Their eyes are liquid black, and one is twice as big as the other. They have a small mouth and an utterly bizarre nose — pointed and almost puppy-like, but so faint as to be ghostly.



It doesn’t stop there.



Baby Freak’s neck and limbs look vaguely proportional until they decide it’s time to stretch.



I’ll be straight with you: Very little is as viscerally panic-inducing as watching a big-eyed cartoonish blob stretch bouncily upward until it’s taller than you.



Baby Freak can also scream so loudly it’s dangerous. I’ve had the displeasure of close-proximity gunshots without ear protection twice in my life. Those gunshots were quieter than Baby Freak. That’s bad.



What’s worse is Baby Freak handles excitement by tangling themselves around the nearest body and screaming.



Worst of all is Baby Freak is terribly strong. Pound for pound, they’re stronger than a chimpanzee.



I know this because the second we opened Baby Freak’s cell, they pounced on me.



They left bruises all over due to using me as both trapeze and trampoline before turning on Merry. They nearly strangled him before leaping to Camila and pulling out handfuls of her fur. Next, they nearly broke Courtney’s arm before Camila flung Baby Freak against the wall, where they flatted like a paintball before sliding to the floor.



Baby Freak began to cry, melting into a quivering, indistinct lump.



I knelt at a safe distance, vaguely aware that Baby Freak triggered an echo of the fear I used to feel around Christophe.



“Everyone is so mean,” they wailed. “Everyone is always so mean.” Tears spilled absurdly, spreading across the floor in a swiftly-growing puddle.



“I’m really sorry,” I said. “I don’t want to be mean. I was just trying to help, but I’m not as strong or fast as you. Can you slow down for me?”



“I’m so nice,” Baby Freak wept. “But no one ever remembers that I’m nice. They only remember when I’m mean. Everyone at the circus was so mean. I had to be mean back. Everyone forgets when I’m nice, but no one forgets when I’m mean. No one at the circus forgot I was mean.”



“I definitely don’t want to be mean. I just want to be want to be your friend.”



I extended my hand.



Baby Freak immediately took it. Their touch was repulsive — heavy and damp and unpleasantly warm, above all powerful —



Next thing I knew, Baby Freak was strangling me, kicking powerful little feet against my shoulders andhappily screeching, “Friends, friends, friends!”



The world darkened, bleeding shadows as thin and twirlingly boneless as the inhuman fingers pressing down on my windpipe.



Just as I fell to my knees, Christophe came roaring in and grabbed Baby Freak.



Instead of letting go, Baby Freak stretched absurdly. I could see arms stretching out of the corner of my eye, and it was so cartoonishly stupid that I laughed even as the pressure of their grip compounded on my throat.



The darkness bled back in, starry and warm. Voices echoed distantly. One started to sing, very badly. I thought of angels. Of course the angels in my heaven would have terrible singing voices.



All at once the pressure lifted from my throat.



I gasped.



Breathing hurt. It hurt and I hate hurting and this fucking *hurt*—



Someone scooped me up and carried me out as my vision cleared and my mind sharpened. Merry followed, and Camila and all the rest.



I realized Christophe was holding me. I kicked slightly so he set me down, but didn’t let go.



I looked over my shoulder, wincing as pain shot through my neck and shoulders.



Larkin was in Baby Freak’s cell, singing.



The terrible voice was his, but Baby Freak seemed enchanted — so enchanted they started singing along and bouncing with excitement. They jumped so high they grabbed their little trapeze and began to swing. Larkin took the opportunity to escape, slamming the cell door behind him.



Then he immediately dragged us to the break room and proceeded to lay into all of us, Mikey and Christophe especially.



“How could you assign Baby Freak to trainees without even mentioning the distraction protocol? And you—” He whirled on Christophe. “Why didn’t you utilize that protocol?”



“It’s not my cell block,” Christophe snapped. “Thanks to people like you, I do not get training for anyone who is not in my block. It is not my fault that I am expected to help at a moment’s notice, but not allowed to know how.”



Larkin looked like he was going to snap back, but restrained himself. “I didn’t know that. You’re right — that shouldn’t be a rule. I’ll talk to Richard.” He took a deep breath and scanned the group. “I’m sorry for losing my temper. Merrick, go down to Medical and have them check your neck.”



“No need,” said Merry. “This is nothing, trust me.”



“Go down to Medical,” he repeated. “Rachele, stay here a minute. The rest of you, go.”



Once the others had trickled out, he fixed me with a look I vividly remembered and viciously hated. “So. Christophe.”



""That is his name.”



“Thanks, I wasn’t sure,” he said dryly. “I’m going to cut to the chase here. Are you in a relationship?”



“Yes.”



“Do you know what he is?”



“Yes.”



“Do you know what he’s done?”



I felt a wave of shame. “Yes.”



“Do you know what he still does?”



“He doesn’t do it anymore.”



“According to Administration, he hasn’t done it in about…two months? I’m not trying to be a dick, but he’s literally five hundred years old. Two months isn’t even the blink of an eye.”



“Why are we having this conversation?”



“Because someone I know is dating a violent serial killer.”



“It’s not that simple.”



“It’s not about simplicity, it’s about what it is.”



I fixed him with a glare and loaded my next sentence with every ounce of compulsion I could muster: “Why do you care?”



""Because I don’t want you to die, especially not the way his victims tend to die. I don’t want him here. I don’t think he should be working with other inmates. I know Richard likes him, but Richard likes everyone. Ask him how well that’s gone for him the last couple of years.” Then he shook himself, looking irritated but surprisingly calm. “Happy?”



“No.”



“Look, I know how Christophe’s behaving right now, and it’s not that I don’t appreciate it. It’s that it’s not who he is.”



“And you do?”



“Yeah. I was on a yearlong A-Class rotation with him and Rafael before I transferred. I know him better than you do. Do what you want, but be careful. And if you ever need help, ask.”



I spun around and stepped out of his office only for Baby Freak to come speeding at me. I barely got out of the way.



Christophe came racing after him.



“Did you let them out again?” Larkin demanded.



“No,” he snarled over his shoulder. “You didn’t lock all of the locks.”



Larkin’s eyes widened and he took off after him, swearing.



Mikey approached, looking exhausted.



“What happened?” I asked.



“The locks.” He flexed his hands. “Baby Freak has really stretchy hands, so we have special  locks for them. Larkin was so pissed at us he forgot, so Baby Freak got out again.”



Far down the cell block, Christophe began to sing. Baby Freak fell still. A moment later, they started singing along.



But instead of crawling into Christophe’s arms, they crawled up the wall and across the ceiling, where they grabbed one of the overhead lights and started to swing, screeching.



I hurried over to help.



“What are you doing here?” Christophe snapped. His expression froze me in my tracks. Then he looked at Mikey. “Why is she here?”



“You can’t control her. What makes you think I can?” Even so, Mikey patted his throat, wincing. “He’s right, though. You need Medical.”



I looked back at Christophe, bristling, but he pretended not to see.



So I let Mikey walk me to Medical.



Merry was there, looking exhausted. He noted the bruises on my neck, then pointed to his. “Mikey, which of us looks worse?”



Mikey left without answering.



“I really want to make a joke,” Merry said, “but I don’t think there’s any joke I can come up about your neck that wouldn’t make Christophe break mine.”



He kept babbling on pleasantly, but I barely heard.



I was thinking of Larkin cornering me, how the Baby Freak disaster made me dread Ward 2 even more, of how dark the world went before Christophe intervened, and of Christophe himself. Christophe with Camila, Christophe with half a millennium’s worth of victims, Christophe with Isam, Christophe refusing to look at me because Larkin had the audacity to remember everyone he hurt, too.



But that wasn’t fair. That wasn’t why he was angry. Larkin was why he was angry.



I realized Merry was saying my name. I shook myself, meaning to smile, but burst into tears instead.



Merry, bless him, handled it beautifully.



At the end he said, “So, just so you know, we’re going to have to be each other’s blood clot buddies.”



“What?”



“See, blood clots are a risk of uncareful strangulation — trust me, I know all about this, *all* about it — and Baby Freak was definitely not being careful.”



After Medical released us, we went back down to the conference room. Everyone inside was looking tired and stressed, Mikey most of all.



“What the hell are you guys doing back here?” he asked. 



Merry said, “After that debacle, we obviously need all the learning you can do us.”



Mikey shrugged and started handing out packets. Each one consisted of handling protocols for a different inmate, except the last, which was my schedule for next week.



“So you seriously tried to send us away without at least giving us these?” I asked.



“Do you think I’m stupid?” Mikey asked mildly. “I was going to bring it to you after class. God.”



Father Mark wearily raised his hand.



“Yes?” Mikey said.



“I think there’s a mistake. Isabella and Velvel are on my schedule, but Isabella doesn’t even want to look at Catholic clergy. And Velvel is Jewish—”



“For real, I think Larkin just saw ‘chaplain’ in your paperwork and went for it.” Mikey sounded just as weary. “I’ll talk to him.”



At the end of class, the Harlequin summoned me for a meeting about Hadron and his upcoming execution.



“Good to see you,” he said when I stepped into his office. “I wanted to—”



“How am I supposed to kill him?” I demanded.



“Quite easily. I have no concerns, and neither should you.”



“Tell me.”



“You sound like a Heart Bird.”



“Sir—”



“I don’t want to discuss methods, I want to discuss purpose. Hadron’s death serves a triple purpose. You have to kill him, you have to take him apart—”



“What?”



“—and there will be eating involved.”



“*What*?”



“Se, this is why I didn’t want to tell you. Now, for the killing itself, you’ll of course have help—”



“From who?”



“A certain hyena of our acquaintance —”



Despite everything, my heart leapt. “Isam’s alive?”



“Thanks to my interference, yes. And barely. Thank your lucky stars it’s ‘barely’ because this would not be possible otherwise. But yes, he’s alive.”



“Who else is helping?”



“Dr. Courtland. You’ll have to do all the work, but he will walk you through what must be done. I hear you’re good at doing what you’re told, so I have no concerns and neither should you.”



“Does Jack know?”



“Jack knows his father’s death is imminent. He thinks he’s ill. It should stay that way.”



“Are we killing Hadron in his cell?”



“No. Research and Development. I’ll expect you there tonight at nine.”



“Why does it have to be me?”



“Because in my Pantheon, we fight fire with fire.”



“But—”



“Do not say that word.”



“What? But?”



He shuddered. “Yes. Now, I ask you to remember what Asher has done and what he will do if anyone in the Pantheon displeases him.”



“They have him under control.”



“They *think* they have him under control for now, but it’s an illusion, one Administration needs to keep themselves sane. But I have no need for such illusions. You have need of illusions, but not this one. Look at it in terms of a cost benefit analysis. What’s the potential cost of keeping Hadron alive versus the benefit?”



“The benefit is keeping him contained while we fix Jack.”



“Jack cannot be helped while his father lives.”



“How do you know?”



“The information came from the same source that helped me avoid certain future files of yours,” he said. “I trust that source implicitly, as should you.”



I had so many questions. So many I couldn’t even pick which one to ask.



“Hadron dies at your hand,” said the Harlequin. “As a result, his son lives.”



A tense and unusual silence stretched between us.



“I would not ask you to do this,” he said, “if I didn’t know it would help. If nothing else, trust that.”



Even though it doesn’t make sense, I did.



For once, I left his office feeling better than when I went in.



I went back to my room, secretly dreading Christophe’s return from his shift, especially because he came back an hour late.



But there was no need to worry: When he came in, there was no darkness in his eyes, no anger in his face.



There was, however, a whole lot of stress.



“I am sorry for how I treated you,” he said. “Do you want to talk about it?”



“No.”



“You never do.” He sat down next to me. “But there is something I need to talk to you about.”



“Which is?”



“Larkin is right to think what he thinks. I do not want you to pretend that he isn’t.”



“I don’t think he’s right.”



“That is not what I want to hear.”



“Then what do you want to hear?”



“It’s not what I want to hear. It’s what I want to know.” He hesitated. “Charlie told me this is not fair to say this to you, but I am going to say it. I want to know that Larkin being right doesn’t change how you feel.”



I was too tired for this, but that wasn’t new. “Nothing he says or thinks or does changes anything. Okay?”



“Okay.” He put his hand on mine. “Are you afraid of tomorrow?”



“Yeah.”



“Have you ever killed anyone?”



I didn’t want to think about this. Not about killing Hadron, not about killing anyone, not about Christophe killing other people, not when I need to draw every bit of comfort I could from him. “No.”



“If you do not want to do this, you should not have to.”



I thought of Hadron, then of Jack. “It’s not that easy.”



“I know. But if I can make it easier, let me.”



We went to bed, but I didn’t sleep. I don’t think he did, either.



The next morning, I went to see Jack. Christophe tagged along. I noticed that Jack lit up when he saw him. It made me feel guilty.



After pleasantries and a couple of games, Jack casually said, “Dr. Courtland told me my dad is really sick. That he’s going to die soon. What happens to me when he dies?”



“Me,” I said. “I’ll take care of you.”



He didn’t look at me.



“I know I’m not your mom, but you’re my family.”



“Okay. He’s not hurting, is he?”



I thought of Birdy and felt another spasm of guilt. “No. Dr. Courtland is taking care of him.”



“That’s what he said. I just…if he was lying, I wanted to make sure.”



“He’s not. I promise.”



“Good.” He tensed up, but there was a faint smile on his face. “The Harlequin keeps visiting me. He wants me to call him Grandpa.”



“I’m sorry. He…does things like that.”



“He doesn’t look like a grandpa.”



“I know.”



The smile faded. “Is he going to hurt me?”



“No. I promise.”



He relaxed. “Okay. He’s kind of cool.”



Shortly after that, he dismissed us politely, promising we could come visit tomorrow.



I spent the day in an anxious haze. I couldn’t stand to be near Christophe — or anyone else, for that matter — so I made my excuses and set off for a solitary walk.



The world outside was thin, slippery ice papered across swamps of dark, freezing mud. But the fresh air cleared my head, and it took so much focus to keep from slip-sliding through the forest that I finally calmed down.



Hours passed. The sun dipped. The air froze. I went back to the Pantheon.



Eating was an impossibility, but Christophe coaxed me into drinking a coffee and two cocoas.



When the time came, he walked me to Research and Development.



The Harlequin was waiting in the lobby with Dr. Courtland. Merry stood between them, visibly stressed.



“So you know what we’re doing tonight, right?” Dr. Courtland asked me.



“I know we’re killing someone.”



“*You* are,” said Dr. Courtland. “ It’s going to be a lethal injection—”



I was so relieved I nearly laughed. “Really?”



“Theatrical executions have their place,” the Harlequin said. “That place is not *my* Pantheon.”



Dr. Courtland quickly ran through the process. “I’ll take care of the set up. All you have to do is the last step.”



“Does Hadron know?”



“Yes.”



I turned to the Harlequin. “How did you get him to agree?”



“With the truth and a not so little bird, plus a hyena for insurance. Let’s go.”



Together, the five of us went to Hadron’s room. 



Birdy waited by his door, taller than a floor lamp and utterly terrifying. For the first time since we met, I wanted to recoil from her. A quick glance showed that Merry felt the same.



“Don’t be afraid of me,” she told me. “I’m still your friend. And don’t be afraid of Asher. It will be easy for you. I made sure.”



“How?”



“Because I was kind.”



The Harlequin opened the door.



Isam lay upon a table in the corner, a broken body in a sack of bruise-mottled skin, on a ventilator but alive. 



To the side was a workstation arranged with things that made me shudder — scalpels, surgical saws, all the things you don’t need for a lethal injection.



And in the center of the room, sitting anxious and alert on an operating table, was Hadron.



The way he watched me made me want to run, but I met his eyes.



We stared at each other as the Harlequin lamented the lack of a soundtrack (“If I weren’t the director with all the requisite responsibilities and decorum, I would have liked to play  ‘T.N.T.’ or possibly ‘The Final Countdown’ to see him off”) and Dr. Courtland busied himself.



Finally, Hadron told me, “Come here.”



Christophe tensed beside me. The Harlequin noticed. “Out,” he said sharply. “And who let you in here? The execution chamber is no place for dogs.”



“Don’t talk to him like that,” I snapped.



“Then make him leave.”



I reached for his hand. “It’ll be okay.”



“Will you?”



“Well, no. But we can deal with that later.”



“Go,” said the Harlequin. “And take the dreamwalker with you.”



They left. Without them, the room was much colder.



“Come here,” Hadron repeated.



“Be respectful,” the Harlequin warned.



Hadron didn’t acknowledge him as I approached. For reasons I can’t quite explain, I was glad.



“For what it’s worth to you,” Hadron told me, “I was lost until I found you.”



“I’m not her.""



“Lay back, Asher,” Dr. Courtland said quietly.



“Hold my hand while I die,” Hadron told me.



“Okay.”



He looked at me, eyes glittering, mouth miserable.



Then he laid back and reached for me, hand closing around my forearm.



It burned.



His fingers stuck to my skin and sunk in like coals.



And it *hurt*.



It was agony. I hate pain. I hate pain the way the Harlequin hates the dark.



Before my eyes, scales erupted along my arms. They weren’t right — not smooth, not beautiful. Jagged and malformed, upright and crooked.



Hadron’s grip tightened. His hand looked different. It looked *wrong*. Full of fire, *made* of fire, expanding, enveloping, all-encompassing —



And suddenly we were hurtling through a dim tunnel of dead fire and dull stars.



I reached out in panic. The walls were smooth and not quite solid. I couldn’t get a grip, so I flailed.



Then my scales — my jagged, crooked, broken scales — caught and dragged, slowing us down.



To my surprise, he let go.



We stopped.



He turned and looked at me. The soft light all around us made him look younger.



“So,” he asked, “do you think death is too good for me?”



His voice, though, was old. Brittle and bitter and so frightened.



It made my chest ache.



“No,” I lied.



“I’m not going to hurt you,” he said. “I just want to talk where they can’t hear.”



“Why?”



 “I came here because of you. *For* you. And now I’m dying for it. The least you can do is listen.”



“Then let’s talk.”



He looked down. There was a long, awful silence.



Then words exploded out of him:



“The dinosaur put things in my head. It was insane. It was so insane I don’t even know what the point was. Kind of like our carnival. No point to that either.”



I waited.



“But some of it wasn't insane. Some of it was you. Only it was me, because I was you. But I was still me, too. I was doing to me what I used to do to you. I’m sorry.”



The longer he spoke, the more familiar his voice became. Like years were falling away. Maybe they were. In this world at least, those years haven’t happened. So why shouldn’t they vanish?



“I hope, someday, you’ll get to be me. Just for a little bit, to understand me.” He wiped his eyes. “So after the dinosaur made me you? After that came a very long time. Very, very long. The way I lived through what I did to you, I lived through what I did to everyone else. All the people who died for what I did for Jack. And I’m still not sorry for it because it’s how I saved him. How I got him here to you. Do you think I should die for that? For not being sorry?”



“No.” I don’t even know if that was a lie.



“After the long, long time, I saw even crazier things. But this time, they weren’t bad. They were sad but they were good. Know why?”



I didn’t trust myself to speak.



“Those things were the ways to save Jack. All the ways.” His chest hitched. “And I have to be gone for every single one. That was always the answer. You without me. That’s how he makes it: Without me.”



His voice broke and he wiped his eyes again. Then he laughed.



“I don’t know why I’m surprised. That’s the story of my life. Everyone’s always been happier without me. Don’t know why I thought you would be different. But I did. I was so lost until I found you, and you didn't even want to be found.”



For a second, I saw him as he’d been — or at least, as my Asher had been. A teenager who’d been born without a future, just like me.



“Don’t lie,” he said. “I can’t lie to you, so it’s only fair that you don’t lie to me. Are you looking forward to killing me?”



“I don’t think I’ve ever wanted to do anything less, Asher.”



He didn’t answer for a while.



Then—



“Do you think it’s true?”



“What?”



“That me dying is going to save him.”



The hope in his voice and the agony on his face nearly broke me apart.



I didn’t want to lie, so I thought about it. Turned it over in my mind. Considered everything I knew and everything I’ve guessed.



Then I said, “Yes.”



“Would you tell me if you didn’t?”



“I don’t know.”



We stood in silence.



“I would have done anything for you,” he finally said. “Anything but lose my son. Why wasn’t it enough?”



There was so much wrong with this.



So much.



But there was no way to say it. Not now, not with hurt flooding every line of his face and emanating from him like light. There was only one thing I could say. It was a lie, but it was right:



“Because I’ve always been so dark.”



He relaxed. “I’m only doing this because I trust you. And I only trust you is because I know that everywhere but here, you’re mine.”



I fought off a full body shudder.



“I know it’s my fault that there’s nowhere our son can be. I loved him so much I ruined everything. But you’re going to fix it. You’ll make somewhere he can be. I won’t get to see it. You will, and I hate you for it. But I accept it, because everything I do is to save him. So I’ll do this, because you’re going to save him.”



“If it kills me.”



This, at least, wasn’t a lie.



He reached out, and I took his hand.



We went back through the tunnel, all dim dead fire except for the deep flickering lines of flame my crooked scales had scored into the walls.



And then we were in his death chamber.



The Harlequin was there, monstrous and circling Dr. Courtland as Isam’s ventilator wheezed. Merry was behind them, promising to do everything he could to find me while Birdy watched from her corner. Christophe stood in front of Merry like a shield.



Of course, Christophe saw me first.



He moved so quickly there was no hope, no chance, no time to even comprehend that he’d moved before Hadron collapsed, bonelessly and strangely weightless, to the floor.



“Bad dog.” The Harlequin’s tone turned my insides to frozen lead. “Very bad dog.”



Aware of the scales on my arms, I stepped in front of Christophe. He shifted like he was going to stop me.



Then the Harlequin shrugged. “But understandable. Put him on the table.”

 

Even though Christophe didn’t need my help, I picked up Hadron by the shoulders. I immediately wished I hadn’t; I felt the broken bones in his neck grind together and nearly dropped him in disgust.



“Bombs require a very particular method of defusion,” the Harlequin said. “It’s a highly intensive fourteen-step process. Fortunately for you, defusing bomb boys is much easier. Instead of fourteen steps to break him down, we’ll simply break him down into fourteen pieces. Doctor?”



Dr. Courtland shuffled forward. The lights threw tiered shadows under his eyes, and he was trembling.



But when he went to stand by me, his hands were steady.



“This is going to be terrible for you.” His voice was just as steady. “Just remember it’s for Jack.”



“You’ll do great,” Birdy said from her corner. “I promise.”



The surgical workstation glared brightly, but everything on it — the scalpel, the bone saw, all the rest — looked terribly dark.



*It’s a game*, I told myself. *Just a game.*



And with that, Dr. Courtland very calmly walked me through my first human dissection. It was awful, but simple.



More importantly, it was quick.



I thought I was done.



Then the Harlequin said, “Excellent. Now remove his heart.”



“What?” I gasped.



“You heard me.”



Over the course of a small, terrible eternity, I removed Hadron’s heart. It was hard, and I nicked something I wasn’t supposed to nick. Blood spurted up, splashing my cheek, burning it so badly I cried.



We paused while Dr. Courtland found a gown and face shield. It made me laugh — if his blood could blister my skin, it would undoubtedly corrode anything else.



But I put them on anyway, and we continued.

Under Dr. Courtland’s instruction, I removed Hadron’s eyes, lungs, and brain. Then I cut off his arms and legs. From there, I removed his feet, and finally his hands. The hand where the friendship bracelet had been — the one with the terrifying, absurd portal through which he’d dragged me, the thing through which he’d wrought his incomprehensible destruction — shimmered like crystalized fire. The hole in the center was dark and endless as Birdy’s eyes.



“Now,” said the Harlequin, “cut his heart into eight pieces.”



Dr. Courtland briefly sagged against the gurney.



Speaking of absurdity, this question came out of my mouth: “Do the pieces have to be even?”



“Of course not.”



“It’ll bleed. What if it burns me again?”



“Can fire burn fire?”



I pointed to my cheek, which hurt all the way down to the bone. “You tell me.”



“That was different,” he said dismissively.



“I’ll help,” Birdy said quietly. She lurched forward and spread her wing over the heart.



I couldn’t see a thing, but it didn’t matter because she guided me carefully. “Cut here. A little to the left. Press down. Now to the right. Go up. Cut. Good. Now to the left…”



And when she finally folded her wing back against her body, I had eight pieces of Hadron’s heart, firm and tough and horribly slick.



“Eat one,” said the Harlequin.



Revulsion almost too powerful to bear thundered through me. “No.”



“Eat one, or your bad dog suffers.”



I picked the smallest piece, bracing myself for pain. To my immense relief, it didn’t burn.



“I thought he’d do that,” Birdy said. “That’s why I helped you cut that piece so small.”



“Thank you,” I said.



“You’re welcome,” said the Harlequin.



I put the piece of Hadron’s heart on my tongue and swallowed.



It burned all the way down.



It made me remember when I’d been at my sickest, after vomiting so much that bile felt like fire eating me from the inside out. Dead rotten fire.



The Harlequin surveyed the ruined heart. Then he picked a piece and ate it. The blood stained his teeth. He looked at Dr. Courtland. “Pick one and eat.”



Dr. Courtland nearly collapsed, but did as he was told.



“Darling girl, pick one for your bad dog.”



The sheer disgust on Christophe’s face was staggering. I looked at him, a silent question. He shook his head, then picked a piece and swallowed it.



The Harlequin turned to Merry. “Now you.”



“Are you fucking serious?” The sheer venom in his tone made me jump.



“Very. You knew this was coming. You should be flattered.”



He glared at the Harlequin, looking so unlike himself I almost couldn’t reconcile it was him. Then he snatched a piece and it began to chew. It made him gag.



Satisfied, the Harlequin picked up another piece and held it out to Dr. Courtland. “Feed this to the better Asher.”



“What if he won’t eat it?”



“Then you die.”



Dr. Courtland took it without a word and left.



The Harlequin turned back to me. “Now choose one for Jack.”



“No,” I said, aghast.



“If you don’t, he will die.”



Nausea overtook me. When it finally passed, I chose the smallest of the two pieces left.



“Follow me,” said the Harlequin.



I did. Christophe followed me. Birdy came after us, talons clacking.



Only at Jack’s threshold did I remember I was wearing a blood-soaked surgical gown. I shucked it off in a panic and kicked it away. Christophe gently removed my face shield and dropped it on the coat.



Then we went inside.



Jack sat cross-legged on his bed, all sad eyes and unhappy mouth, just like his father.



The Harlequin made a big production of hugging him. A smile tugged the corner of Jack’s mouth. “Your not-mother brought something for you. A little treat to lift your spirits.”



Twin surges of horror and hatred welled up inside me as I looked down at the piece of Hadron’s heart in my palm.



It was gone. In its place was a chocolate cookie.



Jack looked at me hopefully. Before I could lose my nerve, I handed it to him. He took a bite and grimaced slightly. “It’s really spicy.”



“It’s a chili chocolate cookie,” the Harlequin lied. “One of her specialities.”



“It’s really good,” Jack said. “I was just surprised.” He finished it in two bites. Then he looked up, frowning, and went very still.



And without a word, he took my hand.



I froze.



The last time Jack touched me, I saw the world as he does: Full of holes. Weird, shimmering, open sores in the fabric of existence through which strange, glittering eyes peered.



The holes were still there, but faded and smaller and somehow murky, like tiny broken windows mended with cellophane.



“What does it mean?” His voice was shrill and fearful.



“It means,” said the Harlequin, “that you — or at least a version of you — belongs here now.”



Jack looked at me almost furtively. There was hope in his eyes, along with hurt and something like bitterness. “How?”



“That’s a question neither you nor I want to hear the answer to. But she does have something you do need to hear, and privately. We’ll leave you to it.” He swept past me, plucking Christophe’s sleeve as he went. To my surprise, Christophe followed him out.



The door closing sounded like the end of the world. For Jack, I guess it was.



“Is it my dad?” His voice was a thin, raspy squeak.



I wanted to speak, wanted to be an adult, wanted to tell him with gentleness, wanted to emanate safety.



Instead, I just nodded.



His voice broke. “Why didn’t anyone come get me?”



“He didn’t want you to see him that way.” My voice was as thin and raspy as his.



“So?”



I didn’t have an answer.



“Can I die too? I want to go with him.”



“Jack—”



“I’m alone without him. I don’t have anyone. You don’t count. I know you think you do, but you don’t. You *don’t.*”



“You’re right. You’re right, but you count. No matter what happens—”



“*All that happened is he left me alone*!”



“You’re not alone.""



But he wailed as if hadn’t heard me: “I’m supposed to be dead and I want to be. I want to go. I want to be with my mom. He wouldn’t ever let me go with my mom. He wouldn’t let me go. Let me go. Please just let me go. Maybe that’s how we get to his dream. Maybe that’s how I’ll be the baby and how he’ll be happy and how we’ll both be with you.”



He dissolved into tears.



Asher’s voice wound through my head: *You will always be so dark*.



I pushed it away. “You’re here with me. And I’ll do everything I can — everything that isn’t hurting you or someone else — to make you better.”



“What if you can’t?”



Now Aurora’s voice echoed: *Palliative care. Hospice.* “Then I’ll let you decide. But let me try.”



“I don’t want to try anymore. I want to go.”



I held him for a long time, my burned cheek throbbing in time with his sobs.



He screamed into my arms. He told me he hated me. He told me he hated his father. He told me he was never supposed to be alive, and begged me to let him go.



I held him until he cried himself to sleep. Then I stayed until he woke up and calmly told me to go away.



I didn’t want to leave him, but I know how it feels to long for solitude that no one would give you.



So I gave it, because it was all I had to give.



When I exited into the hallway, the Harlequin was waiting.



He held the surgical tray. On it was the last piece of Hadron’s heart. The sight filled me with revulsion. “I’m not feeding that to him.”



He shoved the tray into my hands. “Good, because it isn’t for him.”



“I’m not eating it.”



“It isn’t for you, either.”



“Who’s it for?”



“Whoever you want, but choose quickly. We’re already running late.”



“For what?”



“For things to grow.”



“What’s growing?”



“Everything we need to keep my grandson safe.”



“What did you do?”



“Only half of what I’d hoped.”



“Will you please, for once, just talk to me like a normal person?”



“Nothing here is normal, least of all me, second least of all you.”



I unsuccessfully quelled my temper. “Why did you make us eat his heart?”

“To sink anchors.”

“What are we anchoring?”

“Something new.” He clucked his tongue, eyes widening. “Oh, look at your face. That burn is awful. Come here.”

He reached into his pocket and extracted a screw-top tin. When he opened it, the mingled scent of grassfires and cocoa choked me.



“Settle down. It’s just burn ointment — made specially for you, I might add.”



He dabbed it on my cheek. The effect was instantaneous. I teared up from sheer relief.



“That’s better,” he soothed. “Much better.” He surveyed his work for a moment, then said, “Darling girl, there’s something you need to understand.”



“What?”



“Love is a wound.”



It took all my strength not to roll my eyes.



“Pain can be necessary. It can even be pleasant. Sometimes it’s exquisite. But left too long, wounds fester. I don’t want you to fester.”



“Me either.”



“I know. Off to bed.”



He sauntered off. I stayed in place, gripping the tray so hard my fingers were numb while the final shred of heart glistened.



*Whoever you want, but do it quickly.*



And then, as if on cue — and maybe it was, maybe she’d been waiting this whole time —



“Are you okay?” Birdy asked, bobbing toward me. Her feathers shone. They looked beautiful.



“Yes,” I said. “I have something for you.”



“Really?”



“Yep.” I picked up the piece of heart. The texture nearly made me gag.



She approached, looking entirely like a monster. It should have frightened me, but instead it soothed me. “Are you sure?”



“Very.”



She opened her beak, and I tossed the last piece of Hadron’s heart inside.



She shrank down before my eyes.



In the span of a minute, she went from taller than me to the size of a cat.



I scooped her up, suddenly aware that the corridor was painfully cold.



“How’s your nest?” I asked.



“Done,” she said.



I dropped her off at Merry’s door. She tapped on it with her beak as I hurried off.



Christophe was waiting. I knew he wanted to hug me, but in turn he sensed that I didn’t want to be touched. And I didn’t. Not after seeing Isam on his ventilator, not after watching him break Asher’s neck, not after holding Jack. Jack who went starry-eyed every time he saw him.



I wanted to cry. I wanted to be alone. But *alone* wasn’t an option. My options were Christophe and Pierette.



I chose Christophe.



We went to bed, but I didn’t sleep. It was too cold. So cold that I went to Pierette’s room to steal as many spare blankets as I dared. Against his objections, I tucked most of them in around Christophe.



I don’t know what that means. It’s something else I don’t want to know or think about. Just another problem that the Agency will eventually punish or exploit.



Anyway, I’ve been a wreck ever since.



So much of a wreck that the Harlequin postponed my interviews. When he called me for a meeting this morning, he actually offered to postpone them indefinitely. “I mean, to be fair, invasive interrogation techniques are Eric’s proclivity, not mine.”



“No, I'll be fine.” Then I asked, “Why did you pick who you picked to eat Hadron’s heart?”



“Why do you ask?”



“I think you know why.”



He smiled. “I do. And that is *not* why, so relax. I chose the adults Jack likes best.”



“What do you mean?”



“You’re the closest thing he has to a mother. He’s enchanted by me. He hero-worships your bad dog. Dr. Courtland makes him feel safe. His father’s godlike double has captured his imagination and adoration in that half-mythical manner unique to absent fathers. Captain Manlet cured his nightmares. As for your Heart Bird — that *is* a complication.”



“In what way?”



“He doesn’t know what Heart Birds are, but he loathes them. If he knew you or the dreamwalker were close to Birdy, we’d be facing a different and altogether more impossible situation. But as his de facto mother, the choice was yours and I trust you. Just know that Jack won’t.”



“What happens next?”



“At some point, you’ll suffer an open wound that will result in a Jack of your own. In the absence of profound change, it will unfortunately be necessary for the current Jack to survive.”



My stomach fell.



“Much sooner than that —if I have my way — you and I and my wife who I hate and her most broken and beautiful son will construct a parallel. If that happens quickly and successfully, there will be no need for wounds.”



My stomach slowly settled back into its normal place.



“Love is a wound,” he said. “And fate is a thief. This is how we heal and how we reclaim what’s been stolen from us.”



For the first time I wondered — truly, deeply wondered — who he was. What he was. Where he’d come from. Why he cared.



But in that moment, it was enough to know he did.



“Let’s get healing and reclaiming,” I said.

He smiled. For once he didn’t look frightening or threatening or malevolent or inhuman. He just looked relieved. “Let’s.”

And that’s that, at least for now.

I don’t know what he has planned. I don’t know what  Hadron had to do with it. I don’t even know why I had to kill him.

 I don’t know anything at all.

I recently went through the worst kind of torment. I’m now 3 months post breakup but what happened after made it worse.  I want to share my story to help process and get support from you that this was abuse.

I met someone in the elevator of campus and instantly thought maybe he was my husband. But he worried me because he just had the look of someone who is a player, and appeared mysterious. Because of that, I suggested he actually get to know my acquaintance. But then we started to fall for eachother hard. Yet, he asked me on a date AND at the same time pursued an acquaintance. I somehow ignored this red flag and felt like the chosen one when we kept talking instead of her. 

He got me drunk and slept with me right away and I was too drunk to even give consent but didn’t quite register that. He made grand gestures to fly to see me from across the country, but then mentioned how my furniture was easily replaceable if I were to move closer to him (implying it wasn’t expensive). He asked me to stay with him for 2 weeks and he planned an itinerary that covered every single day filled with activities. He did regularly split the bill however - even though he owned a luxury condo and all other kinds of expensive things and made sure I knew of it. He went through a marriage book called “8 dates to marriage” with me excitedly making it seem we were in it for the long haul and even asking what it would be like to ask my dad for my hand 

We started to bicker because he saw I was going out with friends, since we had shared location, and he got insecure and drunkenly yelled at me. Ever since then, he started to become…hot and cold, him neglecting me - he kissed me on the lips a total of 6 times in our 8 month relationship. He regularly put me down, told me I run weirdly, that I’m “the darkest person here” while in France (I’m not white), that my job wasn’t as high level as he thought it was, that I have flat feet, that I have blisters on my feet, pointing out when a girl was checking him out or that a friend wanted to set him up with someone but found out he was taken, criticizing my movements in front of his friends as though I was embarrassing him, having me fly out every week to see him and only seeing me twice.. gaslighting me anytime I called him out  - asking for a girls number in front of me and then saying it was for networking . He once pretended to choke me and also forcibly craned my neck to the mirror and held it really hard and said don’t you see how beautiful you are? He always walked one full block ahead of me and when I commented that it wasn’t very nice he would say “well it’s because you’re too slow.”

Other things he did:

He told me he’d dispose of my body in his closet drawer, jokingly. 

When he had sex with me he wouldn’t really check if he was hurting me and sometimes I’d move backwards to reduce the intensity and he’d just grab me back to him and laughingly say “where do youu think you’re going?”

He would always mention whenever a girl was “making eyes” at him. He always seemed nervous when he introduced me to his friends or we all hung out together, as though I was embarrassing. 

He was very mean to me for being slow at ordering my coffee at breakfast at an amazing resort in France. When we hiked he was always walking way far ahead of me and not even checking to see if I was behind him 

Anytime I tried to progress things past being exclusive he said he needed me to move to his city but then whenever I would make plans to he said he would hate if I moved and it didn’t work out and then I hated him. 

He only ever cuddled me twice. He slept hugging pillows otherwise and claimed it was bc an ex liked cuddling and he got so used to it he replaced that with pillows. 

When I cried about personal things to him he would  roll over and decide to just sleep instead of saying anything or comforting me

He drove me to a point where I had to take a few days of space from him and all this mistreatment that he then dumped me claiming I ghosted him then told me he wanted to stay in touch and that he still had hope

Then he began to follow and get closer to the girl I was worried about while we were dating and now they’re close, but he claims that she has a bf.

He said he has nothing but positive feelings for me  - and was surprised when I mentioned his mistreatment, saying “you never mentioned any of this before..” as though to discredit it. The next day he laid on the charm thick and even hit on me and I fell for it and told him maybe we can still be together one day and he slammed that door shut and ignored me. I felt so stupid after that but realize maybe it was a trauma reaction from me. 

Recently I went to school and one of his closest friends pretended like he didn’t hear me say hi and cruelly made a weird expression, like of disgust and being pompous and walked arrogantly right past me. It humiliated me. I texted my ex and told him, and said maybe I shouldn’t attend the class event the next day bc it’s uncomfortable. and he responds by saying “I haven’t told anyone anything. You should go bc I’m sick and might not be there.” 

So I went to the event and my ex came up to me and said “see this isn’t bad you’re such a drama queen” and he looked very weird. His friend was there and later tried to ice me out again until I said HI really obviously and he awkwardly just said “..hi…some people are coming to my house after u can join if there is room…” very fakely. I felt humiliated again, as though he was fed a crazy story about me from my ex. It threw me back into a tailspin of trauma where I now worry my ex has painted me out to be a crazy unhinged ex or that I’m abusive. ",1,1742869506.0,LifeAfterNarcissism,2,1.0,False

“Good Morning ladies!” The dorm senior, Jenna, shouts as she makes her way down the corridor of the dorms, banging on each door as she goes. I roll over with a gro-an and stretch to pick up my phone. I read the time and then rub my eyes before checking the time again because there’s no way I read it right. Glancing around the room I feel confident that my eyes are now working correctly and check the time again.

“Mother fluffer!” I curse under my breath. I was right the first time. It’s 5:30 AM! That confirms my suspicions that perfect Jenna with the too-friendly smile is evil. It’s the first day of university and classes start at 9 AM. Why on earth is she waking the whole dorm up at 5:30? I can hear grumbling and cursing from the other girls through the paper-thin walls as Jenna loudly announces that it’s shower time. I grab the pillow and press it over my head to try and block out the noise. I had my alarm set for 8 AM, which would have given me plenty of time to shower and have breakfast before our first class. I manage to block out enough of the noise that I start drifting back to sleep. BANG, BANG, BANG!

“Josie Banks, room number 5, I don’t hear any movement in there!” Jenna’s sickly sweet voice calls through the door as she hammers on it, then she begins to rattle the door handle. With a huff I chuck my pillow on the floor, throw back my covers and get up, stomping to the door I yank it open.

“It is 5:30 AM!” I hiss at Jenna. She smiles with fake sympathy as she looks me up and down.

“I am aware of the time Miss Banks, but this year’s stock is going to need extra time to get ready if we are going to make any of you look presentable,” she grins.

“We are not cattle,” I huff and begin to shut the door in her face. She stops it with a foot in the doorway and looks down at her clipboard.

“Josie Banks, eighteen years old, here to study criminology. Father is deceased, mother suffers from psychosis and currently resides in a secure hospital. Josie needs support to process her emotions and would benefit greatly from structure and routine. Josie has no other living rel…” I cut her off by robing the clipboard from her hand and reading the information sheet she had on me. With every word I read of my personal information, my anger grows, like each letter adds fuel to the already growing fire within me. Who gave her this information? She’s just a senior student with a voluntary role as dorm leader, she has no right or need for this information. This is a breach of privacy.

“How did you get this?” I seeth. Students gather in the corridor, their attention now focused on the drama unfolding in front of them.

“As the dorm leader, I am privy to any information that may help me to support you,” Jenna states, holding her head high like she feels superior. “It was in the enrolment statement, that you signed and agreed to when you accepted your place within this university,” she adds. I tear the page from the clip holding it down and slam the board into her heart.

“You had no right to that information, and you certainly had no right to broadcast it to the whole dorm,” I shout as I shove her away from my door. There’s a brief look of shock on her face as her head cracks against the wall before her expression goes blank and she slumps down to the floor with a thud. There's a distinct crack in the plaster on the wall where she hit it. Gasps sound out down the hall as I slam the door. I lean against it in disbelief, looking down at my hands in disgust.

“Someone call an ambulance!” I hear one of the girls in the hall shout.

How did that just happen? I didn't shove her that hard did I?… no, it's not possible, I'm not that strong and I barely touched her. She must have tripped on something and hit her head. That crack in the wall must have already been there and I'd just not noticed it until now.

“Is she breathing?” I hear a panicked voice ask. I don't hear the answer as my ears begin to ring and my heart begins to pound loudly. I feel as if the oxygen has been svcked out of the room as I draw in gasping lungfuls of useless air. My heart tightens with every breath like more and more weight is being added on top of me. My vision goes blurry before turning completely black, then I become light, and the weight lifts from me as I relax into peaceful darkness.

“Miss Banks wake up!” a stern voice penetrates the blissful bubble of silence I had fallen into. I blink open my eyes, letting my blurry vision adjust to take in the figure hovering above me. It's a plump lady with a grim-faced expression that I don't recognise.

“Who are you?” I murmur, pushing myself up into a sitting position and looking around to take in my surroundings.

“ I'm Officer Shelby, I'm with the Mount University Police. We need to take you down to the station,” she gives me a sympathetic smile as she pulls me up to my feet. In the broken doorway of my room stands another police officer. This one is looking curiously between me, the doorway and the crack in the wall where Jenna had been slumped. I svck in a breath as I remember what had happened. Jenna is no longer there, which is good. I must have passed out for a short time and she had reported me to the police for causing her to fall.

“I'm sorry officer, this was all a bit of a misunderstanding. I didn't mean for her to fall, I just pushed her out of my doorway so I could close my door and…” I begin to explain until the officer holds up a hand to stop me.

“Save it for the interview honey,” she says softly, whilst guiding me out of the building and into the back of a waiting police car. My fellow students watch on, giving looks of pity, smirks and utter disgust as I pass… perfect, I've made a great first impression.

Chapter 2

For the next few hours, I watch the clock in the small room they have me locked in. I’d drank my small paper cup of water hours ago and I've counted every tiny crack I can find in the plastered walls at least ten times. Just when I'm at the point of driving myself completely insane by mentally replaying what happened with Jenna over and over again, the door opens. The male officer that I'd seen in my dorm room earlier walks in and takes the seat opposite me at the table.

“Sorry to keep you waiting Miss Banks,” he says, laying a paper folder out on the table. He opens it and begins to read through it in silence. The seconds tick by and I start to get fidgety in my seat at the uncomfortable silence. Just as I open my mouth to break the silence the door opens again and a tall man wearing an expensive-looking suit walks in holding a briefcase. The man looks down at me in an assessing way. He is extremely good-looking and exudes dominance in a way that makes him hard to look at.

“Is this her?” he says in an almost snort, jer-king his chin in my direction.

“Yes, Sir,” the police officer nods, motioning for the newcomer to sit next to him. He takes his seat and reads through the paperwork the officer hands to him. I study his face as he reads. He's one of those ageless guys. His serious, no-bulllshit demeanour makes him seem like he's much older, but his face is young. My guess is he could be anywhere between twenty and forty. He must feel me looking at him as his eyes flick up to mine over the paper and he holds my gaze. Everything in me screams at me to look away, to break the eye contact, but I don't. I won't be bullied by some stuck-up detective. His eyes grow intense and then I swear I see the flash of a smirk before he slams his hand down on the table, making me jump back in fright.

“Are you trying to challenge me Miss Banks?” he asks in a deeper voice than he'd used with the other officer.

“Challenge you?” I snort and raise an eyebrow, trying to use my attitude to mask how much he had scared me.

“I suggest you learn to submit, and quickly, because at the place you are going, the people won't be as tolerant as I am,” he says, closing the folder and putting it into his briefcase before turning to the officer and nodding. My heart pounds in my heart and panic grips me as I watch the two men shake hands. “I’ll take her from here,” the stuck-up detective tells the officer.

“No,” I manage to rasp out. “Please, I didn't mean to hurt her. I can't go to prison. I can't!… Don't I get a solicitor?… A phone call?” I plead with the officer as he leaves the room. I turn my attention back to the suited man. “Please sir, it was an accident,” I sob.

“Not so tough now are we?” he smirks at me. “Let's go, Miss Banks, I have a very busy schedule and don't have time for your tears,” he sighs and heads towards the door. I remain seated, frozen in fear and shock. “You have two seconds to follow me, otherwise I will leave you here and let the police throw you in prison,” he snaps.

“Wait, what?” I gasp and turn to look at him. He gestures to the open doorway he is standing in and without too much thought I scramble to my feet and rush to his side.

“That's what I thought,” I hear him remark under his breath. He walks down the corridor with large strides that I struggle to keep up with.

“Where are we going?” I whisper to him as we pass police officers who don't seem to pay any attention to us. He ignores me like the rude assh-ole that he is and doesn't even look at me until we reach the elevator. He presses the button and turns to face me whilst we wait for the doors to open.

“Tell me, Miss Banks, are you prone to panic attacks?” He asks

“Huh?” I respond, a little taken aback at this whole situation.

“Your file says you passed out from a suspected panic attack at the scene, and you seem to be on the brink of another panic attack now. So what I am asking, little girl, is if I’m going to have to hold your hand through our journey?” He snarks. Anger flares in me at his words.

“Well I’m sorry Mr Perfect, I’ve had a day so do excuse me if I’m a little upset!” I hiss at him, crossing my arms to let him know how much of a badass I am. He gives me another of his barely there smirks and a nod in what seems like approval. The elevator dings at that moment, the doors opening and he steps forward without another word. I follow the smarmy guy in and stand beside him. I watch as the doors close, with a strange sense that they're closing on my old life.

“Collins,” he says, snapping me out of my strange thoughts I turn to give him a questioning look. “It's Mr Collins,” he says in a barely there whisper as he steps dangerously close and looks down at me. So close that when I take a breath my heart touches his. The air suddenly feels charged as I stare up into Mr Collins’ eyes. The arm holding the briefcase snakes around my back and he pulls me flush against his heart, causing me to gasp. Holy sh-it balls this man is hot. He brings up his other hand and gently strokes my cheek with a secret smile, then in a flash he grips my chin hard. “Sleep,” he demands, his eyes flashing blue as he speaks. My last thought before my body shuts down is that I'm going to knee this jer-k in the balls as soon as I get the opportunity.

Chapter 3

“Wake up, Miss Banks,” a smooth voice says, the tone washes over me like a loving caress, and for the first time in a very long time I feel safe and it's not something I want to wake up from just yet. I nuzzle my face into the warmth against my cheek. A sweet, buttery and woodsy kind of scent hits my nose and I give an approving hum at the pleasing smell. A grunt of disapproval ruins my contentment right before I am dropped unceremoniously onto my back. The landing is soft but still unpleasant.

“What the he-ll!” I curse, rushing to sit and take in my surroundings. I'm on a couch in a dimly lit room, bright light suddenly floods the room making me squint against it. I shift my attention to the source of the light, fighting the urge to hiss at it like a feral vampire. A large figure is framed by the beaming sunlight that is flooding the room through a window that spans the entire wall. The figure is fussing with the curtains that he's just opened and I quickly recognise him as the stuck-up detective, Mr Collins. The events of the day come rushing back to me like a tidal wave of anger, fear and complete confusion.

“What did you do to me? How did we get here?” I demand, gesturing to the room and jumping to my feet.

“I don't have time to baby you through this, so here is the quick version,” he starts as he unbuttons his suit jacket and hangs it over the back of a large leather office chair. “My name is Deacon Collins, I am the headmaster of Grey’s Academy and you are the newest student here. Tell me, what do you know about your heritage?” he asks. My eyes are transfixed on his hands as he unbuttons the cuffs of his shirt and rolls up each sleeve to expose some impressive forearms. A throat clearing snaps me out of my trance.

“Oh… um,” I start, embarrassed at being caught staring. “Sorry, I'm a little lost here. I'm not feeling myself,” I say with a sigh and flop down onto the couch. I try to process what the he-ll is going on.

“Due to your circumstances, I am going to assume you know nothing. Here at Greys Academy, our students are gifted…” he begins.

“Wait, gifted?” I interrupt, “I think there's been a mistake. I'm not gifted, I got a pass in all my exams but nothing that makes me stand out,”

“If you'd let me finish Miss Banks…”

“Josie,” I correct, not liking the way he uses ‘Miss Banks’ in an inferior way.

“Miss Banks,” he reiterates, “If you would just keep quiet for two minutes and let me explain then you can be on your way. Our Academy is for what we call Greys. Greys are a race of superhumans. Whilst we are much more powerful than regular humans, we are also small in number. For this reason, we have created our own realm within the human one. This is safer for everyone to live in peace. Somehow, you have slipped through the net and grown up within the human realm. I will be launching a full investigation into how that came to pass, but for now, you are here and you are safe. Now I appreciate this is a lot for you to take in and you have a lot of catching up to do so I won't overwhelm you today. I will have my assistant assign you a dorm room and pair you with one of our more intellectual students to do extra studies with you outside of your regular lessons. I will also schedule some extra studies with our tutors here. Any questions?” he says without a flicker of a smile.

“Oh, you are good,” I laugh. “I love this show! I used to watch it all the time,” I say between bouts of laughter. I get up and start exploring the room to find the hidden cameras. I can't believe I'm on the prank show. I wonder who nominated me, it must have been Freya, my best friend from college. “Was it Freya that put you up to this?” I giggle.

“Miss Banks!” the actor playing Mr Collins shouts, slamming his hand down on the desk, which just makes me laugh harder. I approach him and examine the buttons on his shirt, one must be a hidden camera. Then I start rubbing my hands over his shirt, feeling for the hidden wires. In a flash his hands wrap around my wrists, making me gasp in shock as he grips them hard, stopping my exploration. I look up at him and his eyes are intense as they stare back at me. “What the he-ll are you doing?” he asks in an almost growl.

“Looking for your mic?” I gulp.

“I don't have a mic, this is not a prank. You are new here and you've had a lot to take in so this once I will give you a pass, but if you lay your hands on me ever again there will be punishment. Do you understand?” he says in a low, scary tone. His heavy breathing makes me bite my tongue because I really want to taunt him about what this punishment might be. As if he knows what I'm thinking his eyes seem to flash blue. That's when I remember them doing that earlier, right before he demanded that I sleep, a demand I was powerless to resist. Panic bubbles inside me at the realisation. He's telling the truth, isn't he?

“You made me go to sleep,” I say with a shaky breath. He gives me a single nod in response. “What else can you make me do?” I ask. Fear at how vulnerable I am right now pushes me to ask the question.

“Anything,” he says in a husky whisper, and I swear his face moves closer to mine. His answer doesn't scare me like it should, if anything it excites me. Then a door opens, breaking the trance he has me in, he drops my wrists and takes a step back as if I'm suddenly repulsive to him. I turn to see who the intruder is.

Chapter 4

“I thought I heard voices in here. Is everything okay Dee?” a very attractive woman who looks to be in her thirties says as she walks into the room with a beaming smile. Her hair is jet black and shines as the sunlight hits it. It's the sort of hair that should be in shampoo ads and just enhances her stunning blue eyes and flawless skin. She wears a skin-tight black dress that shows off her hourglass figure and black stilettos, with her finger and toenails painted bright red. She is the kind of woman that makes you feel insecure as soon as you see her.

“Yes. Clarrisa, this is Josie Banks, a new student I've just picked up from the human realm. Could you please assign her one of the single dorm rooms in Ruby,” Mr Collins says, whilst he takes out the file from his briefcase that the police officer had given him earlier and holds it out to Clarrisa.

“Are you sure? There's plenty of space for her in Amber or Saphire,” Clarrisa says, giving me an assessing look up and down before scrunching her nose a little.

“Put her in Ruby please and make sure she has everything she needs,” he says dismissively. Then he sits at his desk and opens up a laptop. I stand there unsure of what I’m supposed to do now. Mr Collins glances up at Clarrisa and then me. “That will be all,” he grunts.

“Of course Deacon, Josie follow me please,” Clarrisa smiles tightly.

“But…” I start.

“That will be all Miss Banks, Clarrisa will get you everything you need and someone will be along to your dorm shortly to answer all your questions and get you settled. Welcome to Greys Academy. I hope there will be no need for any more visits to my office,” Mr Collins says flatly and then turns his attention back to his laptop. With a sigh, I follow perfect Clarrisa.

We exit the office into a glass-lined corridor, Clarrisas heels click loudly on the cream marble floor. Everything feels too bright and shiny. I'd hate to be the cleaner here, there must be a whole army of cleaners to keep all the glass and marble clean. Clarrisa leads me to an elevator and I let an audible breath as I remember my last elevator ride before I was kidnapped by a hot, rude of a… wizard? Then I snort laugh as I think about what is happening. I'm in freaking Hogwarts, and that makes Mr Collins Professor Dumbledore. Clarrisa gives me a disapproving side-eye.

“Sorry, it's been a wild day,” I explain.

“I can imagine. Don't worry about Deacon, he was taking his morning shower when the call came in about you, he had to rush off without his morning coffee, he's grumpy without his coffee,” she laughs, a little too much for it to be real. My mind is suddenly filled with thoughts of Mr Collins in the shower, then I realise what she said. If she was there when he got the call, that means she was there when he was showering. She's his girlfriend… or wife. Of course, she is, she is beautiful and he is hot as he-ll, they are a perfect match. That explains why he jumped away from me like I was on fire, he didn't want his girlfriend to get the wrong idea. My heart sinks a little. I thought I'd felt some chemistry in our short encounter, but I guess it was a wro thought anyway. I'm his student now, and I don't know how things work here but I'm sure it's the same as it is in the human world. Students and teachers dating is a huge no. Why am I wasting time thinking about this when my life has just been completely obliterated?

“Wait!” I blurt. “I need to go back… my mum,” I manage to say through panicked breaths. How could I forget about my mum? Guilt floods me.

“Don't worry about any of that for now, time works differently here so no one will be missing you yet. Deacon will take care of everything, your mum will be just fine. I'm sure he will keep you updated on personal matters like that,” she smiles.

“Okay,” I nod. “What about my stuff? Can I go back for it?” I ask.

“Deacon will arrange for your belongings to get to you, try not to worry and just focus on making your new life here. I know this is a difficult time but I'm sure you will be happy here, we will work everything out to make this transition as easy as possible for you,” she says as we walk through a maze of glass and marble corridors. We exit the building into a courtyard with a huge fountain in the middle. The water comes out through four spouts. Above each spout is a large crystal. Clarrisa stops walking for a moment to let me look at it. “Each crystal represents a house at our Academy. You have been assigned to Ruby for the time being,” she motions to the red stone. “You can easily identify your fellow house students by the colour of their tie. Red for Ruby, green for Emerald, blue for Sapphire and yellow for Amber,” she explains as we walk on. I mentally roll my eyes at the thought of wearing a uniform again. I'm almost 19 years old and I feel like I'm going back to secondary school.

“Where are the other students?” I ask, taking note of how quiet it is.

“They are all in classes, they'll be finishing soon. We have just over 300 students here, it can get quite busy between classes,” she grimaces. Movement in the distance catches my eye and I can just make out a group of about thirty people. They're moving fast around each other as if dancing. As we get closer I realise they're fighting.

“Combat training,” Clarrisa comments, “they're our next squad of soldiers,” she adds proudly. I want to get a closer look but Clarrisa ushers me on and towards an old-looking stone building that's embellished with Rubies. “This is your building,” she says as we go through the door. I look around in awe. It's stunning. It's like an old castle inside but with everything you'd expect in a modern house. The large space has stone walls with thick red curtains around the huge windows. Then there are couches scattered around a large rug with a stone fireplace and real fire. There is a big flatscreen TV mounted to one of the walls with game consoles on the shelves underneath it. On each side of the room is a grand staircase that meets at the top. I follow Clarrisa up the stairs and down a hall, we pass two doors before she stops and hands me a key. “This one is yours, I'll give you some time to settle in and someone will be along shortly to show you around,” she smiles and walks away before I can even mutter a thank-you or get the door open.

Chapter 5

I stand in the doorway of my new room open-mouthed. This must be a mistake. This is nothing you'd expect of a dorm. This is more like a hotel suite. The bed is huge, king-size at least, and the pillows are like plush clouds that I just want to jump into. There is a dressing table with a mirror and a walk-in wardrobe that's almost as big as my entire dorm room at Mount University. The large window is framed by bookshelves, stacked with books of every genre you could wish for, and there's a cosy window seat with cushions and a blanket. I almost squeal in excitement. There's a small countertop with tea and coffee-making facilities and a mini fridge. In the bathroom, there's not only a shower but a full-size bathtub. The whole place is a luxury that I've only ever seen on TV and I have no idea how I am going to pay for it because I don't think a part-time job around my studies is going to cut it. I catch a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror and cringe. My hair is a mess, and I'm wearing a sleep shirt with shorts and my tatty Converse shoes that Officer Shelby had allowed me to put on before taking me to the station. I look completely out of place here. On the back of the bathroom door, I notice a bathrobe and there's a stack of towels and toiletries in the bathroom cupboard. It's not ideal but I could shower and change into the robe for the time being. I hope my belongings are brought to me soon because I'm going to be the laughingstock of the school if I have nothing but a bathrobe and sleepwear in my wardrobe. After a hot shower, I feel a million times better. I wrap myself in the luxury robe and head over to the bookshelves to check out the selection. Jumping into someone else’s crazy world sounds like a great distraction whilst I wait for someone to bring my things and introduce me to my new life. A book titled ‘Greys’ catches my eye and whilst it's not the fiction I was hoping for it looks like a good place to start learning about my new life. I climb into the window nook and start reading. I learned that Greys are a superhuman race that possess powers that include but are not limited to; super strength, manifestation, teleportation, shapeshifting, superior speed, compulsion, telepathy and telekinesis. I blow out a breath and close the book, already feeling overwhelmed and not sure if I can believe all this. Voices outside my window catch my attention and I lean closer to look down at the ground outside. There's a group of men heading towards my building, they push and shove each other playfully and as they get closer I notice how dirty and dishevelled they look. Maybe they were a part of the group that was combat training earlier. The men file into the door beneath my room and out of sight, except for one. From this angle, I can't see much of his features but he looks tall with a mess of blonde hair that's long on the top but shaved on the sides. He seems puzzled as he turns around and scans his surroundings, maybe he's looking for someone. I glance in the direction he's looking to see if I can see anyone he might be waiting for but there's no one else in sight. I look back at the man and gasp, jumping back from the window when I see him staring straight at me. I swear his eyes flashed blue like Mr Collins had right before he'd used his powers on me. Once I've composed myself I slowly edge back to the window, peeking over the sill to see if he's still there. I blow out a breath when I find the courtyard empty once again. A knock at my door makes me jump once again. Why am I so jumpy all of a sudden? Actually, that's a dumb question. I've literally been dragged from my life and dumped into a whole new realm, where the people have powers and can command me to do whatever they like. I need to keep my guard up and my wits about me if I'm going to survive in this place. I open the door expecting to see Mr Collins, Clarrisa or someone delivering my belongings, but the face that greets me is none of those. It's the blonde man I'd seen through my window.

“Well hello there new girl,” he grins at me with the most perfect white teeth.

“Hi,” I respond awkwardly, gripping the front of my robe to make sure I'm not flashing anything I don't want him to see. I hear footsteps coming down the corridor and the blonde man rushes into my room and closes the door behind him, almost knocking me over in the process.

“What the he-ll?” I demand, trying not to show any fear.

“Shh,” he says quietly, putting a finger to his mouth. I'm about to start shouting at him to get out when I hear voices on the other side of the door. When the voices seem to pass by the blonde chuckles. “Sorry, I wanted to talk to you before the rest of the guys find out you're here, I’m Theo Henry, your new neighbour,” he explains and holds out a hand to shake. I bite nervously on my lower mouth debating if I should trust this guy. “I don't bite,” he assures, obviously noticing my hesitation. I look into his eyes and see kindness there. Something deep inside me tells me I can trust him, that he's going to be an important part of my new life here.

“I'm Josie,” I finally say, taking his outstretched hand and shaking it. His eyes flash blue and his eyes go wide as a jolt of fear flows through me right before everything goes black.

Chapter 6

My vision returns as fast as it left. Theo is on the floor at my feet sounding.

“What was that?” I demand, stepping back from Theo and clutching my hand.

“The spark,” Theo gro-ans out, and then he starts laughing.

“What does…” I start, but I'm cut off by my door shattering into pieces. Making me shriek and jump back further. A very angry-looking man stands in my doorway, breathing heavily. He takes in the scene in front of him. Dark hair hangs over his eyes but it doesn't hide the fury peeking out behind the dark locks. His hand shoots out towards me and his fingers strain as if he is gripping something, then my oxygen is cut off. I scratch at my neck, trying to remove whatever is wrapped around it that's stopping me from breathing but there's nothing there.

“Mason stop, I'm fine,” Theo croaks out and pushes himself to his feet before knocking the dark-haired man's arm down. Precious air fills my lungs and I collapse to my knees in relief.

“Josie, are you okay?” Theo asks, knee-ling in front of me.

“Get… out!” I rasp between deep breaths.

“Let me get you checked over by a nurse,” Theo says softly, reaching out and touching my neck. His touch feels soothing but also hurts my tender skin. I smack his hand away.

“You heard the lady, get out Theo, and take that psycho with you!” a female voice calls. I look up to see a short, pixie-looking girl standing near my door, her hands are on her hips and she looks pissed.

“He didn't mean it, he thought she was hurting me,” Theo explains.

“She was hurting you!” Mason shouts.

“No, it was amazing. It was The Spark,” Theo exclaims excitedly. Pixie girl laughs in disbelief and Mason looks like someone just kil-led his kitten. His eyes land on me again and I swear I see murder there.

“Sure thing lover boy, everyone knows that's a myth. Go take your boyfriend and daydream elsewhere,” she dismisses. “And fix this door!” she adds coming to stand by my side.

“What’s The Spark?” I croak out.

“Forget about that for now, we are starting you with the basics, not myths,” she smiles, holding out her hand for me. I take it and let her pull me to my feet. “I’m Dorothy, but everyone calls me Dot. Mr Collins asked me to be your guide, tutor and bestie,” she announces with a salute. “Okay, you caught me, I lied about the besties part but we are going to be besties, I just feel it,” she almost squeals. I'm a little taken aback by her chirpy attitude and how fast she speaks, especially after just being attacked by the Damon Salvatore wannabe. I look over to my door and Theo and his murderous friend are nowhere to be seen, my door is also restored to its former glory, you'd never guess it had been shattered into a million pieces just moments before.

“My door,” I gasp.

“Mason fixed it, he's a grumpy, possessive guy but he's also fiercely protective and he's great to have around when things get broken, granted it's usually him breaking them, but nobody is perfect,” she says with a shrug.

“If I ask you something, will you be honest with me because I'm about ready to lose it,” I ask as I begin pacing my room.

“Shoo-t,” she chirps, flopping back onto my bed and examining her bright pink nails.

“Is this a mental hospital? Because my mum has psychosis so maybe it's hereditary. After everything that's happened today I'm starting to think I've actually gone insane and all this is a hallucination and I'm a patient here, not a student,” I blurt out.

“Nah, it's a school for Greys. Unless I'm hallucinating too… What if everyone here is having the same hallucination and we all think we are at school but really it's a hospital? And Mr Collins is our hot doctor trying to make us all sane again. That would be hilarious,” she says laughing hysterically. I stare at her wide-eyed until she composes herself.

“Is that possible?” I ask. Almost afraid of what her answer will be.

“Nah. But I do like the idea of Mr Collins being a doctor, I'm going to call him that from now on. Now get dressed, or we will miss dinner, and you don't want to see what happens when I miss dinner,” she smiles sweetly.

“I don't have any clothes,” I say with a grimace. Dot gives me a knowing smile and snaps her fingers.

“Tah-dah,” she grins, and motions to my wardrobe. With a frown, I open the doors and look in awe at the now fully stocked rails.

“How did you do this?” I ask in astonishment.

“Fine, you caught me in a lie again. It wasn't me. Mr Collins told me he had stocked your wardrobe. Girl, you must have made a good impression on him. I've never seen him be so kind,” she says coming to stand beside me and bumping her hi-p against mine.

“Kind?” I snort. “He was anything but kind,” he must have brought this in whilst I was showering. Thank god I didn't walk out without the robe whilst he was here.

“Mmmhmm,” she mocks and pushes past me. She grabs a pair of very short black shorts, a black vest top and a red oversized hoody with Greys Academy embellished on the front. Then she opens a drawer and picks out some underwear before throwing it all at me. “Get dressed, let's go” she makes a shooing motion at me.

I take the clothes into the bathroom and dress quickly. Everything fits perfectly and I wonder how Mr Collins knew my size, especially my underwear. I push the thought of him choosing underwear for me from my mind, not wanting that embarrassment to add to the shitstorm of a day. When I leave the bathroom Dot is holding out a brand-new pair of crisp white Converse, I shove my feet into them and follow Dot out the door, ready to explore my new world.

Chapter 7

We head out of our building and across the courtyard to a more modern brick building where students seem to be filtering from all directions. People stare at me and I see them turning to whisper to each other.

“Hey beautiful,” a deep voice says from behind us and I turn just in time to see Dot swept off of her feet by a tall man with a mess of shoulder-length blonde hair. Before she has a chance to respond, another male approaches. This one is shorter and has a military-style shaved head. He wraps his arms around her, pulling her from the blond man and planting a kiss on her lips. I stare open-mouthed at the scene in front of me, waiting for a fight to start or for Dot to protest, but it doesn't happen.

“Put me down,” Dot giggles and squirms in the man's arms until he releases her. She straightens her clothes and looks back at me. “Josie, this is Marcus,” she points to the blonde, “and this is Cole,” she pats the arm of the second man.

“Nice to meet you,” I smile awkwardly at Marcus before turning my attention to do the same to Cole.

“Where’s Joe and Max?” Dot asks the men who are now walking beside us.

“They came early to get us a table at the front,” Cole answers.

“Oh goody,” Dot claps her hands together in delight. “Tables at the front are first in line for seconds, “ she leans closer and whispers to me as we go into a large dining hall. I feel the eyes of all the students all lock onto me and my steps falter at the gravity of the situation I'm in. I feel like a fish that's been dumped into the shark tank as I recount the words in the book I’d read. These are all Greys, superhumans with powers that could do whatever they like to me and I'd be helpless to stop them. How am I going to survive here?

“Don't worry, they're just curious. It's not often we get new students, especially at our age. Most people here have grown up together,” Dot reassures, linking her arm in mine and guiding me to a large table. The room is not as impressive as I'd imagined. I was expecting Hogwarts and instead, this is a standard college dining hall.

“So this is your new pet?” a handsome black man with shocking blue eyes asks as he stands from the table and pulls Dot into his arms before kissing the top of her head.

“Yes, this is Josie. Josie, this is Joe,” Dot introduces. Joe flashes me a 1000-megawatt smile and holds out his hand to shake. I hesitate, remembering what had happened with Theo.

“Hi,” I do a small awkward wave instead and quickly avert my gaze.

“Babe, I got you a milkshake,” a cheeky-looking dark-haired man interrupts, handing Dot a bottle of strawberry milkshake.

“You know how to treat a girl,” Dot gushes, reaching up on her tiptoes to kiss his cheek, before turning back to me, “this is Maximus,” she grins at me.

“Max,” he corrects with an eye roll followed by a wink.

“I’m Josie,” I smile.

“And what did you get me, Max?” Cole asks, elbowing Max in the ribs playfully. All four men begin teasing each other and making jokes.

“Sorry, they can be a bit much, but I love them,” Dot says wistfully as she watches the men scuffle. “Let's get some food,” she adds, leading me towards a large food counter. She hands me a tray and a plate and takes one for herself before she starts loading food onto it. The food is laid out under hot counters in a self-serve-style buffet. I take a slice of cheese pizza and some fries as we move along the counter.

“So which one are you dating?” I ask, glancing over to the four men who are now seated at the table.

“All of them,” she grins at me.

“What?” I gasp. “How did you pull that off?” I add with a giggle. I take an apple and a bottle of juice and follow Dot back to the table.

“It is how we do things here, take a good look around you,” she laughs. I take a seat beside her and the men get up to get their food. Looking around at the other students I notice distinct groups of one female with up to five men at each table.

“Our population is small and females are rare, so mate bonds are formed. It is usually four men to every woman, but sometimes it's three or five men,” she explains.

“And the men don't get jealous or fight?” I ask, finding all this hard to believe.

“Sometimes at first, but they work it out. Our bonds are not ours to choose. There are a couple of our kind that have the gift of sight, they can detect soulmates and match them together. When a female turns 18 the soul-seer guides her to her bonds,”

“And does anyone get a choice in all this?” I struggle to keep the distaste from my voice. This feels dirty and like exploitation.

“Of course they do, some resist the bonds, but they almost always give in eventually. It's not easy to ignore your soulmate,” she shrugs. I scan the room again. Everyone looks happy in their groups. Then my eyes land on a table at the back. There are only males at that table, and every single one of them is staring right at me.

“Who are they?” I whisper to Dot.

“Those are the unbonded, declared to have no living soulmate within the realm and resigned to a solitary life. You've just given them all a second chance,” she says excitedly. My heart skips a beat when my eyes lock with Mason’s, dread fills me when I see the devil in his eyes as he stares back at me with that murderous look once again.

1jj90cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandalsResorts/comments/1jj90cd/st_lucia_grande_1st_experience/,St Lucia Grande 1st Experience,"I just did st lucia grande and was not impressed. The costs seem astronomical. The “all inclusive” is far from all inclusive if you put any thought into what you’re paying for. It’s $1000+ a day for a couple and that essentially pays for food room and drinks. Almost nothing else is included with that. If you want to do anything else they will charge you for every little thing possible. Spent $400 on a 60 min couples massage, already a HIGH price. Then even before we are leaving the massage room they are trying to sell us salt rubs and lotions and what not. Also, the food across the entire resort is unimpressive quality. Some of the reservation restaurants are decent but by no means are blow away quality. All of the milk at the resort for instance is likely powdered milk, the coffee is of the lowest quality. Want to sit outside under any semblance of respectable shade? Oh, go see our paid reservations desk. It feels like a public traded company is running an all inclusive resort and is cutting every corner possible and squeeze every dime out of me at every opportunity. Oh wait, they are. 

The unlimited drinks are made with generally the cheapest ingredients, premade syrups and such. Let’s not mention charging by the garment for laundry. The pina colada I got today for example was just from a standard freeze machine and some cheap rum floating ontop, not mixed in. Similar to the absolute bare minimum to make a pina colada. 

Additionally, the other major pool of this resort is out of service. I’m not sure for how long it has been, but the pool is green and half filled. It’s unsightly.

I Wanted to do a single load of laundry and found it would cost $50-100 and I couldn’t even do it myself. I thought this was an all inclusive experience? Instead they charge you by the individual garment piece.  

I’m writing all of this from the price perspective. If I was paying half the price I think all of this would be pretty expected. I’ve been on many cruises and a few different resorts of different brands in Mexico and the Caribbean. And while they were half the price of my stay here at sandals, they seemed to provide a very comparable experience. A few resorts in the Yucatán come to mind that was $7k for a week for a family of 4 with particularly better food and drink quality. 

There also seems to be a trend here of service being forgotten. Our first night at dinner it took 30mins to get our drinks at dinner on a light traffic night. 

Not to mention being down on the beach, approached by sales people. I went of a sunset walk on the beach and was followed by a drug dealer trying to sell you whatever you’ll buy from him. In 10 mins on the beach we were approached by 2 different people trying to sell us excursions and drugs. It’s not what I expect for a $1k/day price, ontop of the $200-300 more you spend on all the other stuff they want to sell you while you’re here. Nonetheless our relaxing sunset walk on the beach as newly weds was more of a I hope that drug dealer over there stops talking to us. 

Don’t get me wrong, the resort is pleasant and quiet and the service is quite good at times, not at others. 

I’m just overall disappointed I felt as though I paid a premium for an all inclusive experience and instead a corporation has plastered on “all exclusive” to the absolute legal bare minimum to call it such.",0,1742869325.0,SandalsResorts,2,0.33,False

1jj8yen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1jj8yen/biohacks_for_an_adhder_quitting_smoking/,Biohacks for an ADHDer Quitting Smoking,"As the title suggests, I have ADHD and I’m trying to quit smoking & vaping. I have tried multiple times and haven’t lasted more than a month. I’ve tried every tip and trick you can think of; hypnosis meditations, mindfulness, replacing the habit with other healthy habits, CBT/DBT, reading the Easy Way by Allen Carr, nicotine patches, gum, the works. I’m frustrated as I can’t seem to overcome the intense cravings for it; it helps me to focus, break out of fatigue or brain fog, be productive, manage stress & anxiety, and feel grounded. It manages my ADHD symptoms extremely well, better than medication ever did. I’ve been on 6 different medications for ADHD, and they either made my symptoms worse, or they would relieve my ADHD symptoms but came with a horrible host of side effects. My psychiatrist & GP recommended I don’t take meds anymore because of the side effects and my family’s health history, and to try to find other methods to manage it. 

So for symptom management I reach for a few things. I now use coffee, cacao, Yerba mate, and tobacco/nicotine as quick easy fixes. I also take a few supplements/vitamins: Omegas, methylated b vitamin complex with l-theanine, creatine with amino acids, collagen powder. I do drink a cup of loose leaf tea mixed I made myself almost every day; it usually has lemon balm, holy basil, and calendula. 

Lately, I’ve been trying to slowly cut down on my usage rather than going cold turkey; I’ve gone from 20mg/mL nicotine to 3mg/mL of nic in my vape, and I have been taking small hits of herbs mixed with tobacco in my bong rather than smoking a whole cig. I have been able to quit smoking weed daily and I only use it maybe every 2 to 3 months and was easy, but quitting nicotine/tobacco has been really difficult for me in comparison. I worry that if I cut it out, I’ll just go back to it again for the millionth time. 

If anyone has any suggestions for me to biohack the cravings, help me quit for good, and help with my ADHD symptoms so I don’t feel so dependent on nicotine & caffeine to get by, I would deeply appreciate it! ",1,1742869159.0,Biohackers,3,0.67,False

This happened during my second year of college when I was living in the dorms. Our room was set up like this: a living room/common area, a kitchenette, a full bathroom, and two bedrooms. I shared one room with Melanie—Mel for short—while Nikki and Hannah shared the other. Mel and Nikki were freshmen, totally skipping that cramped “freshman dorm” vibe where you’re stuck in a tiny box with one person and a bunch of other newbies. Hannah and I were sophomores. We all got along great and did almost everything together—hit the dining hall, flirted with the boys next door, went to a ton of parties. Everything except classes.



Here’s the rundown on us. Mel was the flirtiest, hands down. She’d broken up with her boyfriend right before college, so she was on a mission—always scouting parties for us. Nikki was her opposite—shy, had a hard time talking to people, but she was the prettiest out of us. Weird how that works, huh? Hannah had a boyfriend, Arman, who didn’t go here. He was the controlling type—didn’t want her doing anything. We’d be out at some party, and she’d get a call from him cussing her out, telling her to get back to the dorm, saying, “I’m coming to pick you up.” Yeah, she’d end up bailing on most stuff we did. Me? I was normal, I guess—a solid 8. White girl, brunette hair, hazel eyes, freckles, and really good at beer pong.



Hannah was pretty too, but she wasn’t the best girlfriend. She didn’t throw herself at every guy, but when she crossed boundaries, she crossed them. Remember how I said we hung out with the boys across the hall? Yeah, Hannah slept with one of them—Bobby. They kept it low-key, but us girls knew. She’d sneak off, say she was grabbing a snack from the campus coffee shop, but we all knew she was next door doing dirty things with Bobby. Anyway, here’s where it gets good.



Fast forward to October. Bobby and his friend Josh, who’d just rushed Sigma Nu, invited us to one of their frat parties. They were newbies, so they pitched this “dope” idea that we should go with them to keep a 2-to-1 ratio. Sounds like us girls got the short end of the stick, right? Yeah, we knew, but we were planning to get fucked up anyway, so who cares? Oh, by then, Bobby and Hannah had stopped hooking up. They were just friends—or so we thought.



We got to the party and talked to a mess of people. It was a neon lights party—dress code was to wear white, and they painted our whole bodies when we walked in. Mel was glowing green and purple, flirting with some guy by the keg. Nikki had pink streaks on her cheeks, giggling with a dude who wouldn’t shut up about his pledge stunts. Girls were sluts, guys were dogs—that’s exactly how it went down. We drank, got shitfaced, but I was still coherent. I knew what was happening. A few hours in, the dance floor heated up. I saw Hannah grinding on Bobby, Mel and Nikki with some guys, and yeah, I was with a couple dudes too.



But this is when I think it happened. Hannah left a little past 11 p.m. and let us know. She waved quick, but her smile was tight—like she knew Arman was pissed already. I told her to text us when she got home safe and walked her outside. That’s when I saw Arman’s black Nissan Altima—those ugly 20-inch painted rims sticking out, hints of silver showing where the paint was peeling off. Ugly. They drove off, and we figured they’d be cuddling back at the dorms eventually. They’d argue and yell, then have make-up sex, then cuddle.



Except that’s not what happened. We called one of our guy friends to pick us up, and when he dropped us off, there were three cop cars at the entrance of our building. We freaked out, ran up to an officer, and asked what was going on. He said they were responding to gunshots but wouldn’t let us in or tell us where it happened. One cop muttered about “a mess upstairs,” and my stomach dropped. We started calling Hannah—no answer. Nothing. We kept trying, but we never heard from her again.



To be honest, we were kind of still fucked up, so we were saying obnoxious things. We told the officer we lived in room 308, and he said we had to call our parents and go home. Later, we found out Hannah died that night. We were never told the gory details, but it was rumored there were more than 15 gunshots. We’re not entirely sure what happened to Arman.



A detective contacted us, and I told them everything—how we were at the party, how Hannah left early with Arman, her boyfriend. I said he was abusive, that he’s the one they should be looking for. I’m not 100% sure if they ever found him. Nikki, Mel, and I moved out of the dorms a week after. We picked up our stuff from the police station, and that was it.



I still think about that night when I let Hannah leave. Nothing like this had ever happened during all the times they’d argued. I keep hearing myself say “text us,” like that was enough. I always wonder what would’ve happened if we’d just told her to stay with us—if we’d dragged her back inside, laughing, instead of letting her walk out to him.

Hii there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s tgats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup akso no fake tan or  fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1jj8tn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jj8tn8/commuters_novel_excerpt/,Commuters (Novel Excerpt),"1. **Remember Reach**

The morning like the cement was grey and wet and grey smelling and the soft blue of alien planet like earth kept fading in. The slow horns and melancholy heroes. Blue ship propulsions: crew in back as family. Stoic gestures signed by the opaque, single color visor—also of fog—and backlit by a solar reminiscence. A team of the optimized, remembered, biologically enhanced: soldiers: spartans; from the past too. Year 2552. A cutscene shows a ball of sanguine flares smearing a darkened sphere ribboned by the naturalness of teal and blue in the void of black. Like some orb of life essence with overwrought strain. The scene is mute. Then… the release of a fateful ocean of base fill. Outside the window he sees only a movement which does not belong to the current moment. People pass down on the street below but they are not people, only traces of something blurry and far away behind him. A young man in a white t-shirt with short brown hair makes it halfway through the crosswalk before looking up and waving: convivial flash: first day of school—apple on the desk. A constant cascade of cyclists, or just regular people on bikes: leisure in the forest… something about a snowcone with a sapped gumball at the bottom point in the summer, or the accent to the virtual picturesque; its liveliness. The automobiles produce equally conflated imagery but are somehow more limited by their metal bodies, until a motorbike comes along and provides dimension from its rhythm beat. He looks up to where the water is coming from. The whole thing becomes nothing but then goes back to something but then becomes nothing again but then he remembers he is looking at the clouds and is able to make out some corners, some outlines if he really tries, then a cloud, the color blue—different from grey—the cold and the difference between warmth, moisture, sound, honking—voice from white noise. 

When everything rushes back with a shape he can at least recognize by avoiding it, apart from the engagement that muddies it all up, and the furry that pushes it deeper than the acknowledgment of its reach, he grabs his papers, filter and bush: to an inferno whose warmth he knows. Back into a narrower field of view as a wave of comfort fills through him. And the hymns of stoic visors come to stick by him and not run off in interest like before with their equal footing with destruction and chaos and injustice and capital and value and money and listlessness and worthlessness and homelessness and greed and lust and evil. Then, that day, like everyday, becomes a harmony with the past and the present and what lies ahead instead of the incarceration of question. 

He goes to sit on his familiar chair and turns on his xbox. The dashboard greets him with its skyrim pastoral wallpaper behind the icons, orange and northern light lit, like the room temperature hum of his own thoughts, more agreeable now. The world ceases to exist but for the anticipation of noble action by thumb-input. The anticipation is so well-doing that he spends the next hour hovering over the different titles of the Master Chief Collection and watching the animation of their artfully recalling backgrounds. The next hour to play the first level of each title, looking for the most something-essence in space opera prologue. The hour after that for liminal, non-directed proportions—the edges of maps, personal campaigns, endless stick forward to sky box—a planet surface ring of the celestial meridian: a Halo. The hour after that searching for Cortana, her narrative appearance not enough. The next few hours for something else, now between different games, some through-line that connects them. Then, sooner than later, the weight of a confused melancholy that presses at his temples always increasing and reminding him of body. Shortly after this part opens the flood gates of Live’s accessibility and the dependence on vicarious images for narratives in the lost-cause abyss of media’s domains as the dope dissipates, and with it, the illusion of ownership and momentum.

  


2.

I sit on the terrace of a coffee shop, away from the digital simulations crowding my home. But the material ones are everywhere. They come in all shapes, all sizes, all color—courier fonts or older—Belle époque (Art Nouveaux), Old English script. A white on blue face cursive: “The Silence of the Street.” A winey red on an oxidized bronze-green: “Refuge.” Neither of these titles are what they say they are. There is no refuge here, even less silence. Everything is a distinguished mess, a gala of costumed individualism. Even this poorer woman with her second-hand Nikes and common-brand puffer. Even this old man with his Gatsby hat and ol’ style, but really now more utilitarian from this industrial by association rain coat, who crosses the street hunched over and softly, scouring the grime-layered sidewalk for any dropped pearl or some fine lace portion. I think, there is no real distinction between people with monetary wealth and people with less of it, except for the number of faces worn—all those faces purchased from the shelves, or in the windows of shops which seem to be everywhere now, beyond the fronts. The less the better though in the long run; then there are limitations and the idea fireworks and portraits on every corner and automobile and poster-wall and shoe and house and sticker and show and famous person and video game and store and design has an identifiable difference from its distance of not being yours.

On the way here I couldn't seem to know what I was looking at and what I was looking for and because of this I was losing myself. So I kept passing by half-transparent window reflections to try and see it. But only: a ghost, or something very frightening. And this it or this something or whatever it was, seemed to carry time like a bolded iron chain always dragging. Even this city is without name; it is not the one ""they"" gave it. That doesn't mean anything, only the man who now rides his bike before me with this purple hat that does not belong anywhere, at least from what I know and have seen, which feels as though it were many things, most everything, simply repeated in the vast calculus of rendition, and turns to disappear around the corner with its secret of origin and unseen black man face. Yes, there. There, is where the city is. That is its name—there is the organism of the metropolis with its indiscoverable streets and untrackable movements and clandestine poetry. Then a nordic woman from the bronze age and with the ancestral rebellion of red hair, given to her daughter at the side in her unique pink pajama set flowered with the print of the millions, comes up through the doors beside me wearing a familiar leather jacket and maidenly and blue flowing shirt like a bunch of other busy mothers, and the city becomes a nothing place again with a meaningless name. 

Last night I had a dream of my younger self, greased black under the eyes and used and oily after an American football game I remember playing in high school. It was the last game of the season, and in the last quarter I ran back a kickoff for something of about 80 yards in a straight and unyielding sprint through midfield frenzies tugging at the jersey. My dad is a proud father in this moment and I see the prophecy of this American football prodigy. He has done what has been the incipience of greatness for many in this sport. Further than that he has performed a desirable trope of the ideal young American man and son of the blue collar father that has been in all the movies and magazines and books and platitudes of early or soon to be father gatherings. It is a beautiful fulfillment, direct and congruent. The echoing of this congruency meets its disembodiment in a phone call back to the father years later. The son has told the father that he is dropping out of a prestigious film school and he is met with the low bitrate, gurgling sobs of his old man explaining his own visions of his son's success and godly figure shining down on them.

Here is the moment I destroy the sureness not only of my old man's pride but my own. I no longer know what I am doing.

I wake up a thief.

—————

It has been 4 months since I graduated college here. Every time someone asks me what my plans are, I do not know what to tell them. I think of saying the truth: ''the tribes in the outlands, I want to live with them; I've been thinking a lot of homelessness; I'm trying to be closer to people right now; the war in Bahrnam."" 

And they look at you like a psychopath. 

And they look at you like an intern.

I try and say these things without saying them completely: ""I don't know, something radical.""

A smile or strained forehead back, and a flight away from the subject, or an even more uneducated suggestion drawn from their own burrows far below the surface web. So many people are like this. Many more because they do not know where to place someone who has studied literature and digital poetics trying to document their life, except back to the schools—back to the damn schools. Maybe this tension is too novel and incongruous except for those who have grown up with the internet and video game campaigns.

  


3.

I am still a thief when I wake up on Thursday morning. It is important to note, however, that there are real thieves and there are fake thieves. Fake thieves only pretend to steal; they have not yet realized that the title of thief they are given has been provided as a lawful distinguisher for those who steal material items and money, in some form or another, from those who have earned these things as a reward for their performance and participation in an economy of capitalism. Then there are the real thieves: those who steal the intimacies—and wills by extension﻿sion—that have either been voided under the mechanical productivity of fiscal exchange or have otherwise been so far subsumed, sanded down against the half-voluntary half-involuntary movement of the majority, the back-and-forth crossings to and from the minority, to which the greatest difficulty, and increasing impossibility of remembering the feeling of another, apart from novelty, has been attached. Right now, as I stretch my legs which flex into a furry of spasmodic shaking, shedding the excess of sleep, and sit up with small and swollen eyes to see flat monochrome of grey light coming through these rather tall french windows, and walk up to the glass and press my uncirculating nose up against it so that the barrier is almost dissipated, and draw lines of movement from the orchestration of two wheels and four wheels and people and dogs going this way and that way, and put the encroaching deep reds of ivy on its green over eroding limestone in the my peripheries with the blue-bottom white-top buses and-the gathering riders and the fullness of the millions of trees leaves at the top and the strangers watching down like me from the uniformity of their giant hundred-flat tower with flowers and towels and planters on the balconies and the smoke stacks pumping endless fog into the flatness and the other generators and machine protrusions on mostly the tops of structure, I am stealing the dead's intimacies—all the aftermaths. And as I get up and make my coffee in the kitchen which is just as still and flat and grey I realize that my profession as a real thief is marked by the extension of my occupation as a fake one, since there is only a little more than 4000 euros in my bank account. Yes, I think, my real stealing has been the fake stealing of time, a time of production which should feed back into the exchange. Hell! this life I am taking! This agent of system! 

I check the window one more time for MEN IN BLACK SUITS. I get dressed and leave my apartment to find MORE, down below, on the streets.

The first few blocks I walk my head is an empty canister that seems to only be pulled to a generally forward direction. I keep having to put my eyes back in front of me. They keep going up the walls and focusing and dropping. A sign, then a door, graphitti, crack in the walls, dirt buildup looking like a crocodile—my feet keep moving. Most people's eyes seem to be looking straight ahead, except for the people that sit down on terrace chairs in front of the bars and restaurants and bars and cafe's. Then the eyes really begin to wander. 

I pass by a restaurant called The Little Dog. One woman who is maybe somewhere from 30-37 breaks the contact with the woman sitting across from her and gives me approximately 1 and a half seconds of her eyes from the acquaintance woman's right shoulder. On reaching the terrace’s left side end a man does the same. He looks over what I presume to be the shoulder of his wife. He is in his 40s; silver streaks running through a coarse mid-level cut hair; thick maroon glasses, clear frame.

A convenience store a little further on. Mostly men here. They are harder than the others who commute more often. They commute also but their efforts have been settled by the acknowledgment of limit, and the communal contentment of what can be afforded. So they sit or stand, knowing each other at this inparticular place (it could be any other place) and enjoy their espressos and smoke their cigarettes neither quickly nor slowly, since they will be back to do the same with each other the next day and the next day and the next day and the next. And it is not important which sports game is on the rather outdated flatscreen hanging crookedly on the white walls yellowing in the background, only that there is one on and there is something to root for if one wants it. And it does not matter who else comes in there because they are aware that they do not own the place just as they are aware of their limited freedom and their familial bonds with the owner who is in the same position as all these men, only in a business-owning sense. And their attire does not mean anything to them, only that it will keep them warm in the winter and reasonably and usefully clothed in the summer, and so they are all in black because it is the least conscious color and color does not mean much when one is trying to survive. And when I pass these men, and if I am lucky enough to catch their blank stares with routine and impotent speculation, I feel a mostly respectful admiration for this interesting breed that has not surrendered but simplified a modern human struggle, distilling it into what is most efficient and also what is most enjoyable with the trim cut-off. From them there is no intimacy, no will that must be stolen, since it is shared equally among the whole. So I move on, catching at the last, the bright rainbow of a lottery scratchers dispenser, absurdly clashing with the indifference of that place which by coin scrubs off the illusion of making it rich in equal routine.",1,1742868760.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I don’t say this often, but today’s workday actually felt like a mental spa day. Light ticket load, zero fires to put out, and just enough time to breathe and recharge. I even had the bandwidth to sip my coffee like a functioning adult instead of an emergency responder.

Except for Donna.
Donna may have just earned herself a permanent spot on my internal “Do Not Help” list. She came in swinging with attitude and the tech skills of a potato. If I had a nickel for every time I had to explain something twice, I’d be retired and feeding ducks by now.

Google training: AI’s looking spicy.
I got to attend the first of the free Google trainings our company is offering. Today’s topic? Agent Space—basically AI that can tap into our private files on Google Drive and behave like a smart internal search engine. The moment the trainer mentioned using it with our ticketing system and documentation, a lightbulb went off: This could make my job stupidly easier. I'm seriously considering pitching it at the next meeting. If it means fewer hours spent digging through outdated PDFs, I’m all in.

Richmond, VA: Take Two
I got my tickets booked for another whirlwind trip to help open a care center in Richmond. Sounds like I’ll be staying at a different hotel this time, which I’m hoping means not the Embassy Suites. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate a free breakfast and beige decor, but that place has the vibe of a retirement home that flooded twice and never recovered. Only half the elevators work, the carpets have seen things, and the cleaning crew looks like they’ve accepted their fate.

Bird TV is live!
After work, we hit Walmart and picked up some bird gear for outside my office window. We now have a 4-foot stand, a regular feeder, and a suet feeder. I fully expect to be the neighborhood’s hottest bird brunch spot by Friday. Honestly, watching birds while helping users feels like it might be the only legal form of stress relief left.

Barbarian glow-up
I also had ChatGPT help me with my Diablo 4 build, and oh man—it’s night and day. I’m playing a Barbarian, and my old “vibes-based” build was basically just yelling and hoping for the best. Now I’ve got a legit setup that actually works, and I’m breezing through fights like a protein-shake-fueled war god. Might even try to run it on my gaming laptop during the trip.

Final thought:
Honestly? If every Monday came with less Donna, more AI, and some tactical birdwatching, I’d be thriving. Let’s see how long the universe lets this vibe last.",1,1742868715.0,u_moodoo976,0,1.0,False

I have a private fb group and private subreddit group call the underground we are an underground resistance movement, we are a community of chaotic good, more on that later.  
  
I have a friend who has created a civics and political awareness booklet, think of it like a modern day Common Sense or The Federalist Papers, meant to inform people about constitutional rights, voting, and the policies shaping our future, including the Constitution, Project 2025, Russia, etc. This is incredible, well thought out and easy to read for the everyday American.   
These booklets aren't online- they're completely physical copies meant to be passed around, left in public spaces and shared anonymously. So far, friends in five states have been discreetly leaving them in coffee shops, libraries, and other random places. We just need more people to help get them out to a wider audience. She's wanting to stay anonymous, I have personally vetted her and she's legit, she requests privacy and I respect that. She is personally mailing people 20 booklets, or will email you the booklet with instructions on how to print it. Issue 1 went out 2 weeks ago and Issue 2 goes out April 1st.  
If you'd like to get in on this comment or DM- I will get your mailing address or e-mail to her  this could disrupt everything, she's brilliant  
  
We are also getting simple, ""All American"" flyers out explaining the impacts of federal cuts and what's happening with the TrumpMusk admin.

One day, I'll get over this, I think.

Maybe.

It's not so much the leaving (yeah, that sucks, it really does, but I'm equipped to deal with it. I'm used to it after all. Everyone always leaves.) but it's the lie. The consistent lie.

As I said to the officer;

""Well, I know this is kinda dark, but thank god I tried to kill myself?""

*Looks like you dodged a bullet, man.*

Yeah, officer. I guess I did, huh?

I don't know if I've said this before in here, but;

If I were to key a car, egg a car, file a false police report and THROW A BRICK THROUGH AN APARTMENT WINDOW then drive off in a 'Totally fine and not at all related to anyone' black Buick SUV, and make false reports to work, then park NEXT TO SOMEONE who was there FIRST an entire hour before I was, I'd be in FUCKING JAIL awaiting a court date.

But who do I expect her to believe? Me, or said owner of the black Buick SUV?

No one cares when this stuff happens to guys.

I've always been a supporter of believe all women. Because I know that guys can be fucking creepy, immature, childish assholes.

But, holy shit, man.

I've faced false accusations before. This is actually the second time in my life.

But that time, people believed my evidence.

And it wasn't even AS STRONG of evidence as I have this time.

Thank fucking god some people have EYEBALLS and can READ THE DAMN PAPERS.

Why do people who actually really dislike me (if not hate me) go 'Nate, you're a prick and an asshole, but holy crap, this is fucked up.'

But *SHE* believes it?

Who lied to her? I've really been thinking about it, and...

It's really fucked up to me that I'm legitimately thinking it's 50/50.

Either she was lied to by person/people that she legitimately massively trusts, OR

***OR.***

She's the best I've ever seen.

I really. Really. Really. Don't want that to be true.

I really don't.

If it is, as I said previously, I'm very disappointed in myself. I'm very hurt.

I finally *finally* trusted someone again.

And then THIS happens?

THIS of all things?

She *knew* I had trauma about this. She *knew* it's what I hated most of all that's happened to me

She knew my mother did that to my father frequently.

She *knew* that my first girlfriend did that to me.

She. Fucking. Knew.

But wow. 6/7 months of faking it that much. It's honestly as impressive as it is hurtful and disappointing.

Like the *mother* in me says 'Wow, good job. Damn. Nice.'

The *father* in me has been taking over though lately.

Drinking. Drugs. Pills. Suicide attempts.

Life shortening damage to myself. All over *lies and deception.*

I was ***BANE*** motherfucker. I was born in the world of lies, deception, manipulation, and masks. Molded by my *MOTHER*. And her little evil voice in my head talking about *how to use this information* and *can you use that information*.

But, it looks like at the very least, I upped my chance of dying from a massive sudden heart attack by a double digit percentage by the time I'm 55.

How ironic. Told at 16 that I'd be lucky to make it to 21 and living, (*because a death sentence never fucked anyone's head up*) then being told at 34 that you'll be lucky to make it 55.

My tattoo will be covering this scar on my left wrist now. I'm using gauze and an ace bandage, but I'll be covering it with a reminder.

That no matter what, that no matter who, no matter how much they reveal of themselves, no matter how much you love them, no matter how much they claim to love you, no matter what;

Never, ever, *ever*, let anyone else in ever again. Never trust again.

Never love again.

You know the really, really fucked up part though?

I really don't know what I'd do if she called me.  
I really don't know what I'd do if she approached me.  
I really don't know what I'd do if she wanted to start over.

I think, honestly? I think she goes on the shelf next to my ex-wife.

My ex-wife gets the title of 'Fuck it, I tried.'  
She gets the title of 'What if?'

I think I'm always going to care about both of them.  
I think I'm always going to love both of them.  
I think that if either of them call me, I'll always answer.  
I think that if either of them reach out for help, I'll help.

Because that's what I am.

She said it best; ""Nathan, you're a healer. You have taken the pain of your life and tried to protect and help people through theirs.""

""I wish we could spend more time together.""

""I wish we could go home together.""

""I wish we could wake up next to each other.""

""I wish Lucas and Elizabeth were real.""

**""I can't wait to go back to being an open book.""**

It's that one sentence that makes me think it was all a lie.

So, was I a target, like she slipped up and said at the beginning? Did she ever plan to leave that 'abusive relationship' with her guy? Was I really a toy after all? Was I simply a 'No, Nathan, you're not a phase to me' phase?

Tell me who you were falling for when we were lying on the floor. Was I such a fool, after all? I never had problems with my head or my heart until I let her put her hands on them. I see myself in the mirror and don't recognize the guy staring back at me. Something's gone from my eyes. Something in there is gone. Checking my eyes for some kind of light, but nothing's inside. And all she thinks of me now is another unwanted number.

*I still hear the things she said to me.*  
*I still wake up from dreams where I hear her voice.*  
*I still see her eyes when mine close. Sometimes with love in them. Sometimes with fear.*  
*I still wake up from text messages telling me to meet her at the lake.*  
*I still wake up 3 hours before work.*  
*I still dream of her and I sitting in Boulder Coffee.*  
*I still dream of listening to her passion about SuperNaria, Five Nights at Freddy's, and Persona.*  
*I still remember that when I needed someone the most, she came for me. She showed up.*

For those already inclined to attend a poetry open mic, would you be more inclined to attend at a brewery tap room, instead of a coffee house?

The last city I lived in, Salt Lake City, had an incredible poetry open mic across their valley and it was heavily intertwined with the consumption of alcohol. And it worked really well for them because of their local craft brewery scene, and I know Tulsa has a pretty good craft brewery scene too.

The downside is the age restriction, however we already have a few all-age open mics, I even host one already that isn't age restricted per se.

Thanks

I just got gifted a Delonghi PrimaDonna Avant second-hand but have had no luck with getting it to work. 

I don’t have a manual so have been following online tutorials and such, but every time we attempt to grind the beans, they do grind (as the beans go down through the grinder) but the machine says “FILL BEANS CONTAINER!”…
Additionally, when we attempt to use the milk cappuccino setting, (which I believe pours hot milk first and then the coffee comes automatically afterwards), it tells me “Ground too fine, adjust mill, insert water spout and press ok”. I’ve adjusted the mill to 7 but this still happens. 

At no point does any water or coffee come out. When I insert the water spout (which I believe is the little thing that goes in place of where the milk usually goes?), a bit of hot water does come out of there (when I press OK after the ground too fine error).

I’ve also emptied all the beans out, including tipping the machine upside down and giving it a bit of a whack to dislodge anything that may be stuck in the grinder. 

Very confused!!

1jj8nl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jj8nl4/fiction_i_saul_e_evans_modern_open_world_action/,"[FICTION] ""I, Saul E. Evans"" Modern open world action adventure game set in the fictional City of Gordonsville, based on an amalgamation of Fullerton CA, Anaheim CA and San Antonio TX. Campaign follows young brain surgeon Saul who has a ""special power"": he can temporarily ""possess"" his patients.","*I, Saul E. Evans*

A modern open world game...with a twist.


**Era:** 2020s

**Location:** City of Gordonsville (fictional, based on an amalgamation of Fullerton CA, Anaheim CA and San Antonio TX)


**Main character:** Saul E. Evans (in his thirties or forties)

**Story:** Saul E. Evans is a brain surgeon with a very special power: his consciousness can ""flit"" from patient to patient, meaning he can temporarily become/""possess"" his patients after surgery.

**Setting:** Gordonsville is a busy city with horizontal traffic lights and stop signs and has various types of residents and tourists on staycations and vacations. Mostly every home in the city has a driveway and there are numerous motels and hotels teeming with tourists from just about everywhere. There are also many malls, movie theaters, skateparks and entertainment venues around the city and many, many parking lots.

**Map size:** Playable area between 46.22km^2 (17.84sqmi) and 562.78km^2 (217.29sqmi) depending on the final product for the mass media entertainmemt market

**Gameplay mode/camera etc:** First and third person

**Vehicles:** Driveable in 1st and 3rd person, up to 75 driveable vehicles; Evans can purchase and store his own vehicles and/or do the same with his ""possessed"" patients

**Special power:** On any given day, Evans' consciousness can only ""take over""/""possess"" up to two patients at a time. Once taken over, he can't take anyone else over/possess anybody else until 24 hours (in-game time) have passed. A full in-game day is the equivalent of one and a half hours in real life.

**Properties/houses:** Evans has his own house - a gated property with a driveway in north Gordonsville, on an extremely long and straight tree-lined avenue (takes about 45 seconds in real-time to drive from one end to the other at high speed with no traffic/obstructions) dotted with other large detached suburban homes. Evans can also purchase other homes and also inhabit the homes of his ""possessed"" patients and purchase/own them whilst they are ""possessed""



**Similar theme in other games?** Some may compare the act of ""possession"" with *Driver: San Francisco*, but *I, Saul E. Evans* goes further and is a more immersive, all-in-one open world game, whereas Driver: SF was purely a driving-only game.



**Interiors:** Numerous open and enterable interiors including malls, coffee shops and movie theaters with seamless entry and exit and use of elevators. Particularly impressive interiors include Lakeview Mall, an enormous mall situated on the corner of Grand Lakeview Boulevard, one of Gordonsville's most scenic streets. The Millennium 99 movie theater is also just a stone's throw away from Lakeview Mall, adjacent to the off-ramp of State Route 244-A.

**Aircraft:** See above regarding the estimated and final map size; depending on the final map size, aircraft availability could range from no availability to numerous aircraft and planes. In the same vein, helipads, heliports and airfields/airports could also be included

**Weapons/firearms:** Whilst Evans himself cannot own/carry guns, some of his ""possessed"" patients may be able to, depending on who they are and what they are up to",1,1742868248.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Posting because my partner has me concerned. I have been taking Vyvanse for almost 2 months now. 

Started on 20mg, had no issues, dosage got increase to 30mg two weeks ago. On TWO occasions out of the now 12 tablets I have taken, I have had blue lips. the rest of my body HAS NOT CHANGED. I just have blue lips. On both occasions I have also released I am pretty cold, but given the current weather and the fact that even my partner is cold. I'm like 90% sure that's all that's causing it. 

Everything I've read online has pointed to ""Raynaud's Phenomenon"" but at the same time, every other part of my body is fine and not changing colour. 

Something to note that may be of importance. I barely slept last night, so I did consume actual caffeine this morning. Just generic trashy instant coffee you get in the grocery store. I wouldn't say I feel jittery or anything, I feel completely NORMAL just obviously the blue lips, took my medication at 7:30am, noticed the blue lips around 9am. It's now 12pm, and IMO they're no longer blue, but my partner is still freaking out and worried about me.

1jj8l9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1jj8l9w/spiritual_delusions/,Spiritual delusions?,"Hi everyone,

I am writing here because I don’t know where else to go or what to do. My husband was not a spiritual or religious person previously. Within the last year he has become heavily influenced by these new age spiritual ideas such as “twin flames” “starseeds” “astrology” and “kundalini awakening” to name a few.

Here’s a little backstory: In June of last year (3 months after we got married), he thinks he met his “twin flame” via a dating website that he downloaded to “get a dopamine rush to stay awake on a long drive for work.” They have never met in person as far as I know, but he believes this person or soul to be his “twin flame” because he felt an explosion is his body while talking to her. He thinks this “explosion” was his “point of no return” and that she caused a spontaneous kundalini awakening.

Since then, he has been OBSESSED with all of these new age spiritual ideas to the point where he cannot focus on anything other than “grounding” himself and reading online materials about these topics. He sits in the spare bedroom or at coffee shops all day every day researching these topics.

We have 4 year old twins and there has been a significant decline in the time he spends with them and me. He has said that he doesn’t care about anything that he cared about before his awakening. Materials no longer matter and the 3D world is just an illusion. He has since had this idea that I (his wife and mother of his children) am a “codependent distraction” from the 5D spiritual world.

His behaviors are polar opposite of the person I married. He believes he is a better person for all of this but from my point of view he has turned into someone with narcissistic tendencies.

Does new age spiritualism seem cultish to anyone here? Could this be consistent with bipolar disorder? I feel like this has brainwashed him into not taking accountability for his actions. He believes that he has no free will. That whatever is supposed to happen is going to happen. Nothing matters to him anymore. Family and people don’t matter to him anymore. It’s all about the stars and vibrations and soul ties.

Edit: I feel like I should add that he started dosing himself with steroids to “get big” right before our wedding. I told him I didn’t think that was a good idea. I also vividly remember telling him that if he starts acting differently we know why. His dad took steroids in his early 20s and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder shortly after. So, there is a family history of mental illness enhanced by steroid use. His dad became aggressive, but since he is not physically aggressive he doesn’t believe he has a mental disorder.",4,1742868061.0,Psychosis,2,1.0,False

Just want to chat about your favourite video games, hobbies, or shows? 

For me the company I work for just had a round of restructuring. While I wasn’t affected directly, my team shrank. It’s demoralizing, colleagues were let go, and more work is put on the survivors. Kind of sucks.

About me: 
173cm (5’9”?), slim but growing into a dad bod. Chinese
Interests:
Netflix, youtube, manga, cooking, food, coffee, drinks, video games, true crime, crunching numbers and watching the stock markets
Music wise - I enjoy a wide mix, mostly older songs from the 90s to 00s
Boybands like Westlife, BSB, NSYNC; MLTR, Greenday, Simple Plan, Coldplay; even ranging to Taylor Swift, Bieber, and EDM.

About you:
Preferably East Asian, but open to chatting with anyone to see how we get along.
Around the +65 (Singapore) time zone, but feel free to reach out from around the world! 
Petite, slim, and small, but don’t hesitate even if you’re tall.
Close to my age or younger, but 18+ only please.
Similar interests, talkative and fun, and can hold a conversation - not a fan of one word responses.
Looking for a long term online companion as well.
Willing to share / trade pics when we’re comfortable.

Bonus points if you’re in Japan because I intend to move there one day! 

Don’t be shy, tell me about yourself!

1jj8hmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/tiredofwallstreetbutt/comments/1jj8hmz/investors_should_continue_to_avoid_boeing_despite/,"Investors should continue to avoid Boeing despite bullish news, technical analyst says
Published Mon, Mar 24 
Lisa Kailai Han
@lisakailaihan","Investors should continue to practice caution when it comes to [Boeing](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BA/), despite the stock’s outperformance in the past few days, according to Oppenheimer’s Ari Wald.

The firm’s head of technical analysis joined CNBC’s “[Power Lunch](https://www.cnbc.com/power-lunch/)” on Monday to offer his take on the beleaguered aerospace and defense stock. Here’s what he had to say.

# Boeing

Shares of Boeing popped 3% last Friday after winning a [multibillion dollar fighter jet contract](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/03/21/boeing-earns-multi-billion-dollar-fighter-jet-contract-from-white-house.html) from the White House, beating out competitor Lockheed Martin. The stock ended last week 10% higher after CFO Brian West told investors at a Bank of America conference that Boeing’s [cash burn is easing](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/19/boeing-shares-jump-as-cfo-says-plane-makers-cash-burn-is-easing.html) this quarter.

On the back of this news, on Monday Melius Research upgraded Boeing to a buy rating, pointing to a “period of positive newsflow” that could help boost the stock. Shares of Boeing ended Monday 1.6% higher.

Despite this, Wald cautioned that he’s still avoiding the stock at its current levels.

“I’m just skeptical about what I see as a longer-term trend of lower highs dating back to 2019; I just wouldn’t be able to defend it on a pullback,” he said. “Now, we saw similar action in the stock in 2022 — that was really kind of the last time the stock started to break to the upside after a sustained down move. Consider though, that period was supported by this new bull market cycle.”

“I’m just unsure if strength can be sustained in what we see as this more later innings bull-market cycle. \[If\] the market tide recedes, I think Boeing comes in with it,” Wald added.

# Palantir

On the other hand, Wald singled out [Palantir](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PLTR/) as one of his favorite stocks due to its high momentum. Despite falling off its all-time high, the software stock has rallied in recent days, adding 4% on Friday and 6.4% on Monday.

“The stock has been able to hold support levels. I think it is still intact. And actually, contrary to popular belief, short-term trading aside, we have shown the factor has typically outperformed, both into a major top and coming out of it as well,” Wald said. “So again, while there is risk for — I think — equity markets as a whole, I like Palantir. I think it looks better than the market. It’s still in an uptrend.”

# Dutch Bros

Wald is also bullish on [Dutch Bros](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BROS/).

On Monday, the coffee chain stock added 7.7% after Morgan Stanley initiated shares at an overweight rating and $82 price target, representing 25% upside for the stock. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Harbour said that Dutch Bros’ new management should boost the chain’s medium-term outlook.

“The uptrend is intact here,” Wald said. “I think with today’s breakout move — jumping back above the 50-day average at $67 — I think the trade is for a test to that low-80 mark. And I think that’s the trade that we see in the upside potential.”

Gosh where to begin? After the New Year I was very depressed and struggling with debilitating chronic illness. I needed my friend to be there and whenever I reached out to her she was just excuses. She made all kinds of promises in person when we last hung out but she’s been absent and avoidant. I was bending over backwards constantly reaching out to her and she couldn’t be bothered to ask me how I am doing, to spare any time. It got me thinking about our relationship, I moved back to the same area as her over a year ago and she’s seen me what maybe 5 times? Even though I live 20 minutes away… I know our friendship didn’t start out this way, but this is where it’s at now. We were going to meet up to get coffee and talk (I wanted to tell her how I am upset with how much she seems to be absent for me as a friend) but felt sick about it and canceled. Stressing over it causes my immune response to go off like I’m under some crazy kind of stress and it literally makes me bed ridden, pain all over, headaches, super nauseous, zapped of all energy. A week or two passed and I get a text from her, I didn’t notice it for several hours as I had been out running errands. She was in New Orleans for the weekend on a band field trip with her 13 year old son and asked me to cash app her $20 for a cab ride because she made her son walk to far. 

I was upset and worried, what choices did you make to sign up in advance to be a chaperone on a field trip and not set aside some money? Knowing that, how could you put your child in a situation like that with your poor choices? I sent her $30 for the cab and she right away texted me a whole bunch. It made me feel like our relationship has been very transactional and that makes me feel sick. The way she has a habit of making really bad choices and wants to complain about the consequences of her actions makes me want to cut her off. I can’t take it anymore and I feel that she crossed a line getting her and her son stranded with no money out of town. What the hell was she even thinking?

She texted me that she has an idea for a business opportunity and I want nothing to do with her now. Any text, call, Facebook comment, timeline share, all of makes me feel sick to my stomach and super anxious. I felt like she was love bombing me on social media once she got money from me. Maybe she was really appreciative but where I stand I don’t want to know and don’t care what the reason is for why she got them into that situation, I just want nothing to do with someone who will do that as a parent.

We have never had a fight or disagreement, but I have also avoided speaking my mind with her a lot to avoid hurting her feelings. Our entire friendship she has just made bad choices where she wants to vent about how upset she is about the consequences of her actions but she doesn’t want advice she just wants to get sympathy. I think she’s a sympathy/victim narcissist. I’m afraid of what she will do and if I tell her I don’t want to be friends anymore. I wanted to just keep avoiding her phone calls and to fade away out of contact with her so as to not trigger her having a full on emotional meltdown that very likely would end up with her showing up at my apartment screaming and crying and trying to throw old gifts back in my face. She did this to an ex when he moved out while she was sleeping and left a note. She showed up to his workplace screaming and crying and threw his stuff in his face and would not stop screaming and crying until he threatened to call the cops. I was witness to it all in her passenger seat…. She has also shot up cars with paintball guns for less….. so…. What do I do? I can’t wait this out, I can’t handle every time she calls, texts, social media comments or tags me just makes me really upset. I need to protect my peace and I don’t want her to show up at my place and scaring me or my roommate. I know she will try to argue me out of it and say but oh we’ve spent all this time together, how could you abandon your godson (her son). What do I do? I want to text her a message about how upset I’ve felt with her over her being absent/avoidant and for getting her and her son stranded with no money out of state…. But I also don’t have it in me to hear her side of things because it’s always some excuse. I want to just block her but that makes me think she will show up screaming at my home.",1,1742867677.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

1jj8evh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1jj8evh/im_feeling_overwhelmed_with_how_life_has/,I’m feeling overwhelmed with how life has progressed over the past year,"To start with health and school, High school figured out that I wasn’t actually just a terribly morbid and passively suicidal person masking under cowardice but experiencing intrusive thoughts. Good progress. Then I started falling asleep in class, in assemblies, etc. Tried to work around it with coffee but felt terrible and not in full control of my impulsiveness in talking, plus it just made it irregular day to day if I was anxious to talk to someone or felt to tired to participate in conversation much. Now between high school and college I’m diagnosed with a chronic and idiopathic condition similar to narcolepsy. At least there are answers 😀 started medication which has been great, although looking at price estimate if didn’t have insurance is scary. Yay I’m not falling asleep in conversation or during dental work but getting to class has been a struggle and my college student accessibility staff doesn’t have anything to offer in way of attendance or late accommodations. I could reduce my course load but I really don’t want to extend how long I’m already planning to be in further education. I tried just staying awake as much as possible to at least make it to my first class so I could shuffle through the day but that only left me seeing bugs that weren’t there and weird depth perception distortion. It feels like a hollow cop out to just keep saying I fell asleep but it’s the truth of the situation. I’m scared for if I’ll be able to find success down this path both in eduction and career wise. I’ve also been struggling with focus and got evaluated for if I was eligible for accommodations through meeting criteria consistent with adhd, and now after getting the report back I have to look into autism and if it would be worth getting a medical diagnosis. My new medication to help with focus is providing some very unfortunate mood swings so now I’m also having more regular bouts of sadness and anxiety which have not been fun. new medications also causing decrease in appetite so at least I haven’t been hit with the freshman 15
Socially my friends at end of high school are now more distanced both physically and with how involved we are in each others lives. On campus now I don’t have any friends I’m very comfortable with, some now unfamiliar acquaintances and a breakfast buddy that hasn’t responded in nearly a month. I ended high school senior year with a fun bout of suprise! It’s ostracism! from some of my peers leading to some time of self isolation as I wasn’t sure if talking with more of my friends would only aggravate further coldness. I feel like it’s hanging over me but I also think my approach to closure would be getting answers, and they made it clear they aren’t interested in communication or resolution seeking.

Am I being stupid?,"I have posted something similar in multiple subs at this point. I am trying to get as varied and objective opinions as possible.

I am a 24 year old dad making 95-100k in rural Tx, about an hour outside of DFW. We got pre-approved for a 250k loan through Neighbors bank for USDA guaranteed.

We have mostly found houses in the 175k range. There would be 0 down payment. We have 15k liquid savings, and cash to close without concessions is estimated to be 8k-10k.

We have no other debt besides my student loans (29k) and a car loan with only 5k remaining. Fiance stays at home and we are getting married this year. Our son is 10 months old. I have an accounting degree and am currently an accounting manager.

Am I stupid for trying to buy, given my situation? We already pay $1400 in rent every month…It feels crazy that it’s actually within my grasp now, but I don’t want to jump the shark. I ran the numbers, and we’d still have 2k of income to save or spend after accounting for all expenses with a mortgage in this range.

We are probably going to make an offer on a 175k home for list price and 5-6% concessions. It’s been on the market for 42 days and there aren’t many buyers in the current market. There are also currently no offers. The home is directly across the street from the elementary school. The USDA guaranteed loan is 0 down, and I’m pretty sure the house is going to appraise for 180k+ based on comps.


We live pretty frugally. I drive a paid off 2010 Camry, shave my head to save in haircuts, etc. All my clothes are either given to me or from the thrift store, and the vast majority of our grocery budget is simple whole foods that are affordable (leg quarters, frozen veggies, beans, etc). I do have 29k student loans, but my payment is only $118/month. She has a $327 car payment that she only owes 7k on. CC debt is minimal, maybe a couple hundred at a given time. Hell, I even intermittent fast so I don’t spend money on food outside home, as well as drink instant coffee. We go out to dinner once in a blue moon.

From the this sub’s standpoint, would I be stupid to do this? I understand that I’m the only one making money and that kinda scares me. I make a good income for my area and age, but what if that stopped? I have an accounting degree and currently work as an accounting manager. Planning to get my CPA soon as well.

Would it be sustainable? We would still have over 2k in income to save/spend/invest after the mortgage, likely utilities, groceries, health insurance, and student loan/car payment. I’d like to save 1K+/20% no matter what, as well as contribute to retirement. 

The sellers verbally agreed to 8k in concessions, which should cover most/all of the closing costs in our area. Once they sign, the biggest thing is getting the inspection scheduled within 7 days and it passing the USDA appraisal (both value and condition).

Old people, am I being stupid by buying this house? Would you do this at my age?

1jj8crk,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1jj8crk/i_have_no_idea_how_to_do_this_weight_loss/,I have no idea how to do this weight loss training without having the guilt of simply just eating.,"Losing weight is extremely hard for me and it's not because of exercise because I literally walk 3 hours a day and I go to the gym... It's food. I don't know what's too much. I don't know what's too little, but I do know that I have been eating a little too little the past 2 weeks and I was finally losing weight and then the guilt comes because I know that I'm hungry because I haven't been fueling my body enough. So I'm eating a little more and I'm waiting myself and I'm back to you. Being a little heavier, it's discouraging honestly, because I feel like if I eat more than a meal a day, I gain weight no matter how much I exercise no matter how much it's healthy and I'm baffled because I don't know how to lose the weight without going down and unhealthy rabbit hole...


I like to say it for context what I had today so people can maybe tell me if this is healthy or too much for me to try and lose weight 

Today I had a coffee for breakfast and for lunch I had a bowl of simply just spaghetti sauce. I didn't want pasta.. it was a pretty big bowl though... And then when I came home from work I was feeling really hungry. So I decide to have a bowl of yogurt with caramelized apples, cinnamon, a little bit of honey and granola and the yogurt is a high protein Greek yogurt, low sugar. 

Again, I felt pretty hungry after that, but then it was supper. So I had spaghetti sauce with orzo pasta again, a pretty decent bowl..

Fast forward too. About an hour ago. I'm still feeling super f****** hungry so I had plain popcorn about half the bag and I made a low calorie high protein dessert with sugar-free lemon Jello mixed with the high protein yogurt with a little bit of whipped cream. I had a very like small piece and I'm not sure this is too much or too little food. I have no idea in my body. I feel like this is too much but I know I'm as hungry as I am because one I'm about to get my period soon but two I've been eating only one meal a day and doing a lot a lot the past 4 days non-stop moving. So I know my body's absolutely trained and craving energy, but I feel guilty for letting myself eat more then a meal a day ... Honestly it would help tremendously from people who have lost weight if they can. Tell me if this is okay, like if I were to eat this on a day-to-day basis. Obviously not the same meals but to that amount. Is that too much? Is that too little like what do I do? Is one meal a day too little? I'm honestly not sure..

A little brief context, I'm 411. My heaviest weight was 160. I am at 138 to 140 lb right now my goal weight is 120 or even 115.",1,1742867356.0,WeightLossAdvice,2,1.0,False

On Monday, I went back to work.



Jack had pretty much become a latchkey kid during the school months, but he was still too young to spend the long summer days home alone. So he’d bounce between his friends’ houses while I was at work, and we’d both meet back up at our place in time for supper.



I let him sleep in and left at the crack of dawn, driving my truck down the road as the sky started brightening at the horizon, backlighting the trees with a soft rosy glow.



It was my first shift back since Papaw’s death. I was hoping to get through it as though nothing had happened, but it’s a bit hard to meet your coworkers’ eyes when they’ve seen you crouched over a body screaming for someone to call 911, when they remember you sobbing in the back of an ambulance as it pulled away.



Most of them had known me for years. They’d gone to school with me. They were my neighbors. They were friends of my grandfather’s. I’d grown up going to their cookouts and Christmas parties. They’d been at the funeral, crying harder than I was.



The moment I pulled into the lot, I knew there was no escaping it.



I clocked in, smiling and nodding as best I could, and spent the safety meeting staring at my shoes, trying to ignore the eyes drifting back to me again and again. I performed the equipment checks and helped unload the latest shipments with a performative mechanicalness.



But, despite my every effort to show I was doing just fine, it only took until our break for someone to bring it up.



“Hey, Elijah,” Mike said, walking over to me casually. He was an aging man, old enough to be my father, with the long scraggly beard of a biker. “How ya holdin’ up?”



“Alright,” I nodded.



“How’s Jack?”



“Better than me. Kid’s resilient.”



“That’s good. I- I, uh, wasn’t sure when to give this to ya,” he said awkwardly, holding out some aluminum wrapped dish of food. “The missus made it for ya.”



“Oh, that’s real nice of ya’ll. Make sure to tell her I said thanks.”



I didn’t have the heart to tell him I had enough pot roasts and casseroles in my fridge to feed a small army. Nothing says ‘sorry for your loss’ like poke sallet with bacon.



“Hell of a thing to happen.”



“Yeah.”



“You wanna join us after work?” Jesse added from off to the side.



I’d known him since kindergarten. It was a bit hard to take him seriously as a grown adult, when I remembered him as the kid who once tried to beat a tree with a baseball bat and had it snap back and slice open his forehead. He still had the scar - a faint crescent above his eyebrow. I once heard him trying to flirt with a hiker passing through, lying to her that he got it in a fistfight.



“We were gonna go to the bar. Neal’s band’s s'posed to be playin’.”



He was constantly inviting me out, and I turned him down almost every time. I’d been trying to rebrand myself into a responsible adult, while Jesse didn’t seem quite ready to grow up yet. Admittedly, I was jealous of him in a way.



“Nah, sorry, maybe next time,” I shrugged, grasping for an excuse, “I don’t got anybody to watch Jack.”



“Well, hey, I might could for ya sometime if ya need,” Mike offered. “House has been a bit empty since Ellie went off to college anyways.”



“Thanks, I’ll definitely keep that in mind,” I said, coming off as more dismissive than I’d meant to.



“Yeah, anytime. Take care of yerself, Elijah.”



“You too.”



“And, hey,” Jesse said, putting his hand on my shoulder and lowering his voice as Mike walked off, “If ya ever want to get black out drunk and shoot the shit for a change, let me know.”



“Yer a real shoulder to cry on.”



He shrugged. “I had my uncle die on me a few years back. Last thing I wanted was people treatin’ me different, walkin’ on eggshells, bringin’ up all the heavy shit.”



“Damn, man, I didn’t know. I’m sorry.”



“Don’t you start.”



“Right,” I laughed.



I could tell they were all doing their best. I don’t know if I could have done any better in their place. But I couldn’t help simultaneously wanting to spill my guts to them and punch them across the jaw. I settled on keeping to myself.



Truth was, I wasn’t that focused on the funeral, at least I was trying not to be. As I got back to work, I found my mind drifting more to the pine tree and the tracks in the woods. I thought about asking somebody about what had happened on the deertrail. I wondered if they’d have similar stories, if there was a simple explanation for it. But I quickly thought better of it. They wouldn’t want to hear it. It just wasn’t something you talked about. I needed to forget the whole thing, put it behind me.



But despite my best efforts, I wasn’t fully present on the yard. It would take a few attempts for people to get my attention. I found myself zoning out and misplacing my tools. After I almost sliced my hand off with a bandsaw, my supervisor pulled me aside.



“Maybe ya came back a bit too early?” she asked. I knew what she meant.



“You want me to go home.”



“Take a day or two off, that’s all I’m sayin’. I’m not blamin’ you. But you’ll do more harm than good pushin’ yerself like this.”



“We need the money.”



“Call it paid time off then.”



“Really,” I insisted with a breathless smile, trying to hide my humiliation, “that’s not necessary.”



“He was a good man, Elijah.” I felt an instant prickle in my nose, tightness in my chest, and realized my eyes were watering. I took a deep breath and forced it back. “It’s hard for all of us to come to terms with. And it’s gonna be hard as hell on you, that’s just the truth of it. So, yeah, I’m askin’ ya to go home.”



She gave me a look that told me it wasn’t an argument. I knew the angle she was trying. Maybe if she acted like a hardass, I wouldn’t rail against the kindness underneath. I knew it was a losing battle. The least I could do was take it with dignity. I clocked out and got back into my truck, imagining the whole time how it must look to the others. *Poor kid*, they’d think. *Can’t even stomach coming back*. Just the thought of it made me angry. And the anger made me feel immature. No winning, huh?



I decided to swing by the market on the way home, so that the day wouldn’t be a total waste. I had a mental list of things we were running out of. Laundry soap, new toothbrushes, and the like. It was hard to keep track of all the mundane, domestic things that needed to be done on my own.



I was standing in the aisle, debating whether the cheap paper towels would last as long as the name brand kind. The rising prices unnerved me slightly. What would we do when all the food we’d been gifted ran out?



Despite being a bit short for his age, Jack managed to be all lanky limbs and protruding ribs. I was starting to worry he was malnutritioned, but without Papaw’s income on top of mine, we’d already have to stretch the money just to cover three meals a day for both of us. I didn’t know what I’d do once he hit puberty and his appetite grew.



“Don’t get the cheap ones,” came a voice from beside me, breaking up my thoughts. “You’ll end up spendin’ twice as much with how many it takes to clean anything.”



I turned to see Pastor Ellis, the local preacher, pushing a buggy full of groceries.



In an area where there was a church for every denomination every square mile, living in a one church town was how you knew you were really out in the sticks. His father had been the Pastor before him, and his father before him. Their family were the only men of God I knew.



I tried not to let my dread show on my face. The last time I saw Pastor Ellis was a few days before, when he’d led Papaw’s funeral service and burial. I’d ducked him the entire time, even as I could see him eyeing me from across the chapel, itching to come over and give his condolences. But I hadn’t wanted to speak to him then. I certainly didn’t want to now.



“What?” I asked, remembering he’d said something to me.



“The paper towels- name brand’s better. In my experience at least.”



“Oh, thanks,” I nodded, hoping this wouldn’t turn into a conversation.



The Pastor stopped beside me, not even bothering to pretend he was looking for something on the shelves. It was definitely a conversation.



“Haven’t seen ya in a while, Elijah. Been missin’ ya and yer brother during service,” he said, with that friendly backhandedness, “How’ve ya been holdin’ up?”



God why did everyone insist on asking that?



“Pretty good,” I recited. “How’s yer family?”



“Oh, ya know how it is. Wife’s a saint. Kids are a handful. We’re tryin’ for another actually, God willin’ and all.”



“Really? How many would that make?”



“Got five right now.”



“Wow,” I laughed. “And to think I’ve got my hands full with Jack.”



“You should bring ‘im by sometime,” the Pastor grinned eagerly, as though he’d been waiting to bring this up. “Bet he’d get along great with my boys. VBS is over, but there’s a youth group that meets twice a week at the church too. Could get him off yer hands for an afternoon at least. Do ya both some good.”



“Well, that’s awful kind of ya.”



It wasn’t a bad idea. I’d grown up going to church every week, and even though I’d lost interest, I felt bad depriving Jack of that. He should get a Sunday school education at least.



As bitter as I had been, I didn’t stop believing in God after Mom’s death. I used to be the perfect Christian. As a kid, I evangelized to other kids on the playground, convinced I was saving them from hell. I used to do that “accept Jesus into your heart” prayer that was meant for newcomers, at the end of every single service - so that in case He didn’t hear me the first time, I could still be sure to go to heaven. The fear of God was so strong in me that I never caused trouble, not even in typical childhood ways, and would go out of my way to confess when I did. I was constantly anxious and guilty and ashamed - and the model son all the same.



But as I got older, I didn’t have room in my head left for it, too full already with grief and anger and listlessness. I just wanted to have fun for once. To do all the things I had denied myself in childhood. So I started shoplifting, going out to graffiti with my friends, drinking myself sick. Nothing too abnormal for a teenager, but I’d been conditioned to understand faith as a sort of purity. And I was no longer pure. What would God want to do with me? So religion slipped through my fingers bit by bit, until one day I looked back and realized I didn’t believe at all.



Now, in adulthood, I had managed to slowly shed the reputation I’d had in high school. At least on the surface. But everyone still thought of me as a cautionary tragedy. I could tell by the way they looked at me. When you didn’t show up to church here - people noticed. And my hesitance to go back had turned from a refusal to a pathological avoidance. I didn’t owe them anything.



So it was understandable that the Pastor’s offer rubbed me the wrong way.



Besides, if anyone was a more popular topic of gossip than me, it was him. He had a large family in a large house on a large property. It was only natural that some thought he must be skimming from the collection plate. Tall tales like that seemed to follow him like a shadow. His mother passed under suspicious circumstances. His wife was secretly a drunk. Some particularly nasty ones too, claiming that his father had quietly tried to keep the church segregated in his day.



His appearance wasn’t any more reassuring. The Pastor had a naturally gaunt face and exaggerated features. His collared shirt hung off his frame, cinched by the belt at his waist. I wasn’t a small man by any means, but even still he barely came up to my shoulder. His feathery hair was slicked back loosely. His eyes were dark, half-blunt half-soulful, like twin inkwells. His sharp edges and twitchy gestures gave him a rather crow-like affect.



Of course, I tried not to put much stock in rumors. He’d always been nice enough to me, and there were plenty of people in the community who’d defend his good name to their dying breaths. But I could see why, behind closed doors and fake pleasantries, some people didn’t trust him.



Suddenly, the Pastor cocked his head at me and smiled. I had the strangest feeling that he somehow knew exactly what I’d been thinking.



“Don’t mention it. Anything I can do to help.” I nodded absently, and he took a deep breath of finality. “Well! I won’t keep ya any longer. Sure ya got plenty to get back to. I’ll keep ya in my prayers, Elijah, it was good seein’ ya again.” He extended a crooked, willowy hand for me to shake.



“Yeah,” I said, taking his hand, “thanks again.”



“Anytime. Don’t hesitate to reach out.”



“‘Course.”



He wheeled his cart around the corner, pointed shoes clacking against the tile floor, and I felt relieved to see him go. I grabbed the cheap paper towels and headed for the register.



The drive home should have been uneventful. I’d driven that way countless times, to the point I didn’t even have to think about it, it was all just second nature. But halfway through, when I was alone on a long forested stretch of winding roads, I realized I’d forgotten to pick up some coke and the newspaper from the store for Papaw. And then I realized there was no reason to.



It was like a train engine had rammed straight into my chest, cracking my ribs like dry twigs and driving the splinters through my lungs. I tried to pull it together, but my vision was clouding over and I couldn’t see the road, so instead I pulled my truck into the shoulder. I parked there for a moment, clenching and unclenching the steering wheel.



I had known this was coming. You could only ride the high of numbness for so long. And when grief came it was always unexpected and inopportune. It had been the same way with Mom’s death and the same way with Granny’s. But at least with them I’d known they were dying. At least with them I’d had someone left to help me through it afterwards.



“C’mon, c’mon, c’mon,” I breathed, “c’mon-”



My voice shattered on a sob. Something was scraping me clean from inside. I couldn’t breathe. I beat the dashboard and screamed all the ugliness from my lungs.  I cried until I had given myself a headache. And when it was over, I stared into space, and laughed darkly to the empty air.



“Ya left me alone with a kid, ya son of a bitch,” I muttered. “No plan, no goodbye, nothin’. I shouldn’t have to figure all this out on my own. It’s not fair. It’s not fuckin’ fair. And ya know the worst part? The real irony of it? The only person I want to talk to about all this, is you. I still need ya, is that what ya wanted to hear? God, this is just like ya, ya know that? Should’ve expected it. Granny was right about ya. You were always a right bastard.”



That made me laugh for real.



I smiled stupidly, wiping my eyes, running my hands through my hair, and sighed. The train had passed. It wasn’t any better, but it was over for now, and that was enough.



By the time I slipped through the front door of our house, I was fully worn out. I kicked off my shoes and quietly dropped the poke of groceries onto the dining room table. Exhaustion always brought out the silence in me.



I hadn’t expected Jack to be home this early, but I heard the clicking of the burner lighting from a room over and immediately followed the sound.



I stopped short the moment I stepped foot in the kitchen. He was leaning over the stove with a cigarette held to his lips, trying to light it on the blue flame - immediately jumping away when he saw me standing there. He shot me a guilty smile, holding the cigarette behind his back like I was stupid enough not to notice.



“Hand it over,” I sighed, holding out my hand.



“But-”



“Jack,” I warned.



His smile fell. He passed it over angrily, slamming it down into my hand, and tried to pass me back into the hall.



“Woah, woah, wait.” I blocked his way, holding up the cigarette. “Who’d ya get this from?”



“Found it,” he shrugged.



“You expect me to believe ya just found an unlit Marlboro on the ground or something?”



“Yer not my dad, alright?”



“Well, legally, I pretty much am.”



“It’s not that big a deal-”



“Did Noah give this to you? Ya know, I don’t think ya should be hangin’ around that kid. There’s always some shit like this with ‘im.”



“It wasn’t Noah. Jesus.”



“Calm down, I don’t need the attitude,” I said, exasperated, trying to keep my voice from rising. “What, do ya want to get sick like Granny did? ‘Cause that’s what yer actin’ like.”



“*Pfft*, Granny didn’t die from smokin’,” he rolled his eyes.



“What do ya think causes emphysema?”



“It wasn’t that. Can I go now?” he brushed me off, trying to get past me again.



“No. What do ya mean it wasn’t that?”



“Just forget it, alright?”



“Jack.”



He fidgeted in place, refusing to make eye contact, and hummed an ‘I don’t know’ sound.



“Talk to me. What do ya mean?”



He chewed his lip for a moment, hoping I would just drop it. But by now I was more confused than upset. When I kept watching him expectantly, Jack huffed a breath out his nose and asked, “Remember how she started losin’ her hearing?”



“Yeah?” I urged him on.



“Well I was doin’ homework in the kitchen while she was knelt down fixin’ the pipes under the sink, when we heard the whistle. Real close by, like it was comin’ from the yard…” he rambled childishly, voice trailing off. I waited intently for him to continue. “Her… her back was turned and she must’ve mistook it for me sayin’ something, ya know? ‘Cause she said, ‘Speak up, I can’t hear ya.’ And right then there was another, louder whistle. Like- like it was comin’ from right outside the open window. She looked o’er at me and realized, and her face went all pale, and- anyways, a week later…”



I looked at him for a long moment, dumbfounded. I wasn’t sure what to say, so I sputtered out stupidly, “I- I thought you didn’t believe in all that.”



“I don’t,” he spat. Then he knocked his shoulder against me, forcing his way through the doorway, and stomped across the house to slam his bedroom door.



I leaned back against the counter and wiped a hand across my face. Was he lying? Making up some story to mess with me? Why would he? But even if it was true, did it matter? I still couldn’t make up my mind whether or not I really believed in all that either.



Then I remembered the cigarette still in my other hand.



*Aw, what the hell,* I thought.



I went out back and smoked it, praying Jack wouldn’t come outside and cry hypocrite. I didn’t smoke often, really. It tasted worse than I remembered. But it felt good as hell, cathartic almost. I felt a pleasant lightheadedness, a buzz beneath my skin, and realized I hadn’t eaten anything all day. I exhaled a last plume of smoke, throwing the butt into the yard, and resigned myself to go warm up one of the casseroles for supper.



I put Jack to bed early that night, as punishment for the cigarette, and stayed up to watch some TV in the living room. I switched channels to the NASCAR night races. Granny had always put them on when I was growing up. “I don’t give a rat’s ass about the cars,” she’d say, “I’m just in it for the crashes.” She’d had a point. I kept waiting for one of them to spin out and barrel roll into some fiery pileup of fiberglass. Morbid maybe, but it felt anticlimactic when they all stayed intact.



An hour or two passed, along with quite a bit of Papaw’s leftover bourbon, and I was comfortably drunk when I got distracted from the race by a sound coming from down the hall. A soft rattle and dragging screech, like blinds being drawn and the single-hung screen shoved up. I sighed. I’d told Jack a million times, he could keep his window open in the summer, as long as he left the blinds and screen down at night.



I stood up to go correct him, but as I walked over, I saw that the light in his room was still off, no telltale glow coming from the crack beneath the door. Not even the pale blue of his night light. But there were still soft, shifting sounds of movement. It was strange to imagine him fumbling around in the pitch dark.



Unnerved, I threw open the door and switched on the light.



Jack was knelt on top of his desk, leaning out the open window with his hands on the sill. He flinched and looked over his shoulder at me like a deer in headlights.



In the shocked silence, I could hear earth crunching right outside. Heavy and irregular, like footsteps limping away. A shadow skirted around the patch of light thrown out into the yard. I stood frozen for a half-second, confused from the alcohol, too in denial to even move.



Then a thoughtless rage took control of my body.



I raced to the window and pulled Jack down from the desk, forcing him behind me. 



“Hey! Hey, come back!” I shouted into the night. “Ya better stay the fuck away, ya hear? I’ve got a gun! I’ll shoot ya dead if I catch ya here again! I’ll kill ya! Fuckin’ creep!”



“Elijah, stop,” Jack whispered, horrified.



“Who was that?” I whirled on him. “And ya better say it was one of yer friends!”



“Nobody, honest-”



“Bullshit!”



“I’m-” he hiccupped, tearing up, “I’m sorry.”



“Jack, this is important, ya need to tell me who the hell that was.”



Tears were streaming down Jack’s cheeks in earnest now. He sniffled and choked, wiping his face with his sleeves. He focused on one spot in the corner of the room and wouldn’t meet my eyes. I could see him trying to pull himself together. But I didn’t have the patience. The window felt like a yawning cave beside us, close enough for someone to reach through and grab my arm. I glanced over to make sure no one was standing there, knowing that it meant breaking one of the rules yet again. The patch of illuminated grass was empty.



I turned back to Jack, who looked like he was trying to disappear through sheer force of will. “Enough,” I said, irritated and antsy. “Tell me the truth.”



Jack mumbled something incoherent.



“Louder!”



“I don’t know!” he sobbed in frustration. “I can’t pronounce it. It was foreign or something.”



“Foreign? What do ya mean foreign?”



“Like… Heeshun… Leewung…” he tried, mumbling incoherently. “Please, don’t be mad… they only wanted their bones back… I *promise*.”



“They what?” I snapped, sure I had misheard him and fed up with his nonsense.



But then I looked down at the desk and realized.



The collections of rocks and feathers were all there in their scattered piles and labeled jars. But the animal bones were gone. 



Every last one.



Every instinct in me went blank, a wild mess of impulses blaring in my head, while my body seized up with some deranged sort of buck fever.



“I’m boardin’ up this window,” I muttered finally, half crazed, as I slammed it shut and yanked the blinds closed. “And yer sleepin’ in my room tonight.”



“But-”



Jack cut himself off abruptly with a violent flinch, throwing his arms over his face, and I shot him a questioning look. But my confusion quickly softened into horror, my anger dissolving like humidity in a frigid downpour. I had raised my fist without even thinking about it. I had never laid a hand on Jack. Never. I relaxed my hand, mortified, and shoved it in my pocket.



I swallowed thickly. “S’not a goddamn debate. Go to my room. Now.”



Jack watched me warily for a long moment, breathing heavily. A blank expression fell over his face, his eyes almost vacant, and he nodded absently. A sinking guilt poured through me, filling my heart to bursting. I hadn’t touched him. I hadn’t even touched him. But as he turned and left the room, a desolate shame lingered in his wake.



My throat closed up, my eyes threatening to water, and I quickly shoved the feeling away. I buried it somewhere deep inside myself, where I wouldn’t have to look at it. Like turning away from my own reflection in disgust. I knew I should apologize to Jack, but I didn’t think I could face him. It was best to just forget it had ever happened. I couldn’t undo it. I just had to make sure it never happened again.



Schooling my expression, I followed after him, making sure the windows in my room were all locked and covered. Then I grabbed the bat from beside my nightstand and sat in a chair by the door, my knee bobbing up and down like a jackhammer. The TV droned on from the living room, but I couldn’t bring myself to leave the room and turn it off.



Jack curled up in my bed, our mom’s sweatshirt clutched to his chest, still sniffling softly. Eventually his breathing evened out, and as the hours dragged on, he fell into a deep sleep. I got up only once, to pull the blankets over him and brush the hair from his face. Then I went back to my post by the door.



I didn’t sleep the whole night, tensing up at every creak of the house settling. When the first rays of sunlight slipped through the cracks of the blinds, I put my head in my hands and let out a weary breath. I was dehydrated, nauseous, and achy - my hangover a million times worse for not having slept.



I waited until I was sure the sun had fully risen before I opened the windows. Softly, I slipped out the bedroom door and into the hall, bat still in hand. The grip was slick with my sweat. There was an indent in my palm from clutching it so tightly.



I shut off the TV and started heating up some coffee in the kitchen, trying to clear the fog from my head, when there was a soft knock at the front door. I straightened up immediately and listened.



Quiet.



Knock, knock-knock-knock. Knock knock.



Quiet.



I grabbed the bat from where I had propped it against the cabinets and crept around the corner toward the door. The small windows on either side had their curtains drawn. A shadow eclipsed one of them, leaning up close, like someone trying to look in. It drew away again, towards the door.



Knock, knock-knock-knock. KNOCK KNOCK.



I stood a few paces away, bat raised, and waited.



“Hello?” came a voice, making my breath catch in my throat. “Elijah?”



I swallowed thickly, my mouth dry. My pulse was beating so quickly I thought my heart might give out. I readjusted my grip on the bat.



“-it’s Mr. Ellis? We, uh, we talked at the store yesterday?”



I faltered at that, eyes narrowing at the door. Was it really him? Of course it was him, what was I thinking? Or was that how it got you? Could it be some sort of trick? No. No, it had to be him. I was being absurd. Worse, I was being impolite.



“I know yer home, yer truck’s parked outside. Are ya there?”



I lowered the bat hesitantly. It had to be him. What else would it be? I tried to think through the sleep deprivation. Tried to be rational. Yes, it’s him, don’t be rude.



I put my hand on the doorknob, took a deep breath, and pulled it open.

1jj89ey,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jj89ey/my_friends_father_was_taken_and_the_police/,My friend's father was taken and the police wouldn't help us for 48 hours. We should have waited. (Part 1),"Audrey and I weren't exactly close friends. I mean sure we'd shared a couple of classes last year, chatted a bit since we were stuck next to each other in geometry, but it wasn't much more. This year we were lab partners in Dr. Karper’s class so we exchanged numbers but the conversation hadn't extended further than “Hi” and “Is this Audrey?” followed by “Yup” and “Cool”.

Something odd happened last Tuesday, however. I was at work, bored out of my mind behind the counter. I was watching two of my classmates, completely baked, trying to pump gas. I was just waiting for them to realize the large “OUT OF ORDER” sign over the screen on the machine. Just as the one kid pointed up to the piece of copy paper we'd put up on the pump hours before, I felt a buzzing in my pocket.

Of course I knew it was my phone but considering my boss was working the night shift with me, I didn't want to take any chances. My parents would've killed me if I'd lost this job. In my head it was probably just a scam call anyway. I didn't have anyone I knew who would call me after 11pm on a Tuesday. 

I didn’t check my messages until I got home that night. I threw my work vest on my bed and shut the door behind me, collapsing into my desk chair as I did almost every night these days. I pulled my phone from my pocket and swiped through all the notifications I’d missed. Most of it was the same garbage my friends would always send but there was one that caught my eye. A new voice message from Audrey. I had to double take, honestly a little taken aback. We didn’t have any homework due, no project that needed discussion either. Essentially, unless she had somehow fallen in love with me that night and had to confess her feelings, she had no reason to be calling me at 11:16pm. And considering she already was dating somebody, I could safely rule that theory out.

Swiping away my friend's usual junk messages, I immediately went to call back Audrey, quickly jumping to the conclusion that I'd forgotten some school assignment we were supposed to do that night. The phone rang and I impatiently tapped my foot, leaning back on my desk as I waited for her to answer. She never did. I'll admit now it was extremely unlike her but in my own exhaustion from a long, tedious night at work, I didn't think enough of it and collapsed into my bed. I didn't think of a lot that night. Most importantly, I didn't think of listening to the message Audrey had left me.

When I woke up that morning, it wasn’t from the beep of my alarm clock or my mom’s incessant knocking. It was chilled air seeping through my bedroom window. I rolled up in a ball, trying to grasp whatever warmth I could from my bedsheet and blanket but to no avail. I didn’t realize where the cold breeze was coming from, begrudgingly sitting up to try to investigate. It was still dark, the moonlight shining in through the window. My eyes locked onto the window across the room from me. It was wide open, the curtains gently swaying from the draft that had been flowing in. 

I stared at it, puzzled. I almost never opened that window. In fact in my entire life, I could only recall two moments that window was ever opened. One was when I thought my Lego airplane could fly. The other was when I tried handing my dad lemonade as he was power washing the house. Neither ended very well. I cautiously stepped out of my bed, swinging both my legs out and begrudgingly standing up. I yawned as I shuffled over to the window. I examined the frame, the glass, the lock, anything that could have somehow let the incessant late autumn air into my room and disturbed my sleep. I shut the window, sliding the lock into place having failed to find the culprit. I jostled it a couple times to ensure it was secure before swinging around head back to bed. As I did so, something caught the corner of my eyes.

It took a few moments for my eyes to adjust to the darkness that enveloped the majority of my room but I could clearly make out a figure on the futon across from my desk. I froze in my tracks, my mind immediately jumping into fight or flight mode. My heart started to race as I tried to think of what the hell I was even going to do. My phone was still in my bed, if I tried opening the bedroom door it would make too much noise. I couldn’t even tell if they were awake, it was too dark to tell. They could have been staring right at me, spotlighted by the moonlight coming from the window. Then the figure shifted, sitting upright and seemingly wiping its face. It sniffed and snorted, as if it had been crying. Then it spoke.

“I-I’m sorry Charlie. I… I didn’t want to wake you up but… I didn’t know where else to go. I was scared. I-I am scared.” The voice said.

I knew the voice anywhere. It was Audrey. I never thought that Audrey Sheppard would be in my room, let alone be sleeping on my futon. We had a pretty platonic relationship and again, she had a boyfriend so even if either of us wanted more it would make things… ugly. But here she was, sad and scared. She looked awful. Her hair was a mess and it seemed she had scraped her arms climbing in through the window. She had dried tears down her cheeks and her eyes were tired and washed out. I switched on my desk lamp and immediately went to her side.

“W-what the hell happened?” I asked. She put her head in her hands and tried to hold back tears.

“My dad… s-someone took my dad…”

“Wait what? A-are you serious?” I asked, finding her statement a little hard to believe. Audrey had always been a pretty grounded person. In our boredom during geometry, there would be more than a few times we’d discuss hypotheticals to try to pass the time. I generally would think of the more far fetched answers and Audrey tended to be more realistic with hers. She always seemed to ruin my fun. With that in mind, I immediately knew she was in fact serious.

“Y-y-yeah… I-I mean… I could hear everything. He sounded… he sounded so scared.”

“Alright listen I’m sure there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation for whatever happened. M-maybe you’re mom-”

“She had nothing to do with this.” Audrey snapped, shutting down my suggestion quickly. She took a deep breath. “Besides, I didn’t see a car.”

“Then who the hell was it?” I questioned. Audrey hesitated. 

“Well it… it looked like a man was in the hallway. I-I never saw him, just his shadow against the wall. The lights were off anyway. I-I was so scared Charlie. I couldn’t move. I didn’t move, not for an hour maybe. That’s when I called you.”

“And of course I was stuck at work with Roger all night. Fuck I wish I answered that call now.”

“I-it’s ok, really. I mean it’s not like our calls have really ever been about something fun.. o-or important honestly.” She tried to break a smile. “It’s always complaining about Dr. Karper while struggling with chem assignments. I’m not sure I’d risk my job just to hear that.”

“Hey come on, those conversations are fun in their own right.” I argued, trying to lighten the mood a little. She broke a smile for a moment and shrugged.

“I guess so.” Audrey admitted. 

“C-can I ask um…” I paused, questioning whether I should ask what had come to mind. “Why didn’t you call the police? O-or anybody else, honestly.”

Her face quickly sank back into reality, the fear returning to her eyes.

“The cops… they told me to call back if he didn’t show up in 48 hours. Two whole days. Said they can’t file a missing person’s report before that time period had been reached. A-and who else would even believe me? Carl is a great guy and all but I honestly think he’d call me crazy if I told him everything that happened.”

“Audrey, you haven’t even told me everything… I mean what exactly did you hear?”

She didn’t respond, just staring at me with her sorrowful blue eyes. She looked down, playing with her fingers for a moment before letting out a sigh.

“I-it started with the crying. I-I could hear him sobbing. Then… I heard him dragged… out of bed, fucking violently down the stairs…” She paused, trying to contain herself. “F-fuck sorry I um…”

“Hey listen it’s alright, we can just wait until the morning if you-”

“N-no it’s ok.” She took a deep breath. “I could hear every single hit his head took on every single stair. I-It’s like it was intentional… I-I even counted our staircase afterward. 15 steps. 15 bumps. And when he reached the bottom… I heard a crack. T-then… then a scream. He was slid across the wood floor and outside. His screams became distant… so distant it was almost as if I was hearing it in my head instead of outside. I was completely frozen… I-I seriously thought it was a nightmare. The last thing I heard… it must’ve been a full minute afterward… was the door slam shut. A-and I’m telling you Charlie, it was such a strong slam it knocked pictures off the wall. T-there’s still glass at the bottom of the stairs.”

I didn’t respond, I mean honestly how could I have? What I had been told was ridiculous, it was crazy, it was insane. But this was Audrey. It wasn’t some lunatic. And we weren’t in New Hampshire State Hospital. This was Hillsborough. The only claim to fame we’d ever had was being the childhood home of Franklin Pierce. But who is anyone kidding? Nobody could even remember what number President he was. Or that he was a president at all, honestly.

“Y-you don’t believe me… I-I’m so stupid I should’ve known this was-”

“Audrey,” I interrupted her, “I… I don’t know what happened to your dad. But I know you wouldn’t lie about this. I believe you… despite how fucked up this all is.”

She quickly wrapped her arms around me in a tight hug, resting her head on my shoulder.

“You have no idea what that means to me, Charlie. T-thank you… god thank you so much.”

We both quickly realized that as the first rays of sunlight began to lighten the night sky, we’d have to go to school that morning. And because my parents wouldn’t exactly approve of a girl they’d maybe met twice staying over in my room without their knowledge, we both thought it best that we get out of the house before they even wake up. That landed us in the parking lot of Hillsborough Diner far before either of us would normally dare wake up. I gave Audrey an old sweatshirt from my closet to cover up the tears made in her t-shirt from the climb up the tree and Band-Aids for the numerous cuts on her arms and hands. She owed us a fresh box.

Sitting down at the counter, the diner was surprisingly busy for six in the morning on a Wednesday. It was mainly commuters, naturally. Most were just grabbing a cup of coffee or a quick meal before heading to the bus stop down the street or jumping on 202. The waitress, a young woman probably in her mid twenties handed us menus with a peppy smile.	

“You guys are up pretty early, school doesn’t start for another hour or so if I remember right. Pull an all nighter for a project?” She asked. Audrey and I exchanged exhausted looks, turning back to the waitress and simply nodding. It wasn’t worth it to even attempt explaining our night. She laughed.	

“Well you look like zombies, no offense. So maybe I can get something to help you wake up?” She suggested, starting to pull out her pad and pen.

“I’ll just have um… some pancakes… and tea.” Audrey answered quietly.

“French omelet I guess and just uh… orange juice if you have it.” I followed. She quickly scribbled on her pad and stuffed it back into her pocket.

“Coming right up.”

We watched her walk back into the kitchen, pushing the doors open and letting them swing shut behind her. 

“I-I don’t know how I’m going to do this, Charlie.” Audrey admitted. “I can’t just pretend everything is fine.”

“I know but think about it this way… at school it might be safer.” I let out a sigh. “I never thought I’d be actually advocating to go to school but if… if there is someone or something out to get you or me or anyone, being in a bigger group would make it less likely something happens. A-and there’s more people to help if it does.”

“I guess you’re right.” She replied softly, looking down at the counter while twisting her silverware in her fingers. “I’m just scared.”

“Me too.” I admitted quietly. “I-I mean I honestly didn’t want to bring this up but um… you know what, nevermind. It’s stupid.” I quickly shut myself down. Audrey’s head shot over to face me, intrigue in her eyes.

“W-what? What didn’t you want to bring up?” She asked almost desperately.

“I-it’s nothing really. It’s du-”

“Charlie, what is it?” She cut me off, her voice stern. “I-I need to know. If it could help figure out what happened to my dad, tell me. Please.” She insisted. I didn’t immediately respond, almost scared of her reaction. She’d either think I was an idiot for suggesting it or she’d actually consider it. Either option I didn’t like the thought of.

“Well um… you moved to Hillsborough freshman year, right?” I started.

“Yeah, why?” She responded quickly, her words sharp. I hesitated to answer.

“I-if you’d grown up in town. And I mean like grown up since pre-school, kindergarten, that kind of age, you’d have heard of Hillsborough's urban legend.”

“Urban legend? What the fuck are you talking about?” 

“It’s a local story, you know. Like Bigfoot or the Mothman, jersey devil, that kind of thing.”

“Yeah I get what an urban legend is Charlie. What does it have to do with what happened to my dad?” She replied, almost annoyed at my dancing around the topic.

“N-nothing, honestly. It’s just a story.”

“Well I want to hear it. I don’t give a shit if it’s just a story.”

“Alright, alright. Jesus, it’s not even a real story. I-I don’t know if I even remember the whole thing. I probably haven’t heard it since 7th grade.”

“You totally do, come on out with it.”

“Fine,” I groaned.

Hillsborough is a boring town. I’ll be the first to admit it. But like most boring towns, the people who live there tend to try to find ways to make it interesting. To put it on the map, make a name for themselves. I’m not sure who came up with the story of the Weeping Widow but whoever they are, they were a bit messed up in the head.

During the first world war, the winter of 1917 to be more specific, a young bride of a Contoocook Cotton Mills worker got a knock on her door which she feared more than anything. Two army officers handed her a letter that her husband was dead, probably blown to pieces by an artillery shell or machine gun fire. People forget how gruesome world war one could be.

She was heartbroken, the love of her life stolen from her far too soon. Their home, isolated from town at the base of Thompson Hill, was now a prison where she would only be reminded of the world she lived in before her husband had been killed. She stopped seeing her friends, family and soon stopped leaving all together. For weeks people thought she had gone and left town along with the memories of her lost love. However, they were wrong. The widow walked from her home, now disheveled, starving and aggrieved. She walked into the center of town, uncontrollably crying with dark black stains around her eyes. Then, in broad daylight, jumped from the Hillsborough Bridge into the Contoocook River with the whole town watching.

Some people have been more brutal with the details than others, but for us as kids it was kept pretty PG. Nobody knows what happened to the body. Honestly there is no record of the event even happening. But the story became that of folk lore. A ghost story of a lost widow you could hear quietly sobbing through the woods. A feeling of being watched when walking alone on a dark empty street far later than you should be out. An angry spirit hell bent on snatching you up and dragging you down with it to steal your soul. That was the real impact of the Weeping Widow. Another monster story, meant to keep kids home in bed at night. 

Throughout the decades a few disappearances in the state forests kept the story of the Weeping Widow alive, some superstitious people attributing those very real tragedies to a ghost story. As a kid sometimes I’d think about the version of the story my mom or dad had told me, or the more graphic version I’d heard in the lunchroom at school. A sense of unease would come over me as I walked home from school. Or maybe while hiking with my friends I’d hear or see something seemingly nobody else did. But as we grew older, the story slowly lost its punch. It had gone from a terrifying tale parents used as a scare tactic to a high school bonfire story I’d heard told on more than one occasion lightheartedly. I even remember a few seniors went on a hunt one Halloween to try to get a picture of the Widow. Ultimately we all grew up, monsters weren’t real after all. 

When I’d finished telling the story, or the latest version I’d been told of it, Audrey looked at me with a bit of disbelief.

“H-how the hell have I never heard this?” She wondered, “I seriously can’t-”

“Audrey, stop” I cut her off. I let out a sigh, “It’s a story. A local folk legend. Please don’t tell me you’re actually considering this a possible explanation.” She didn’t respond, her eyes looking down at the counter almost with shame.

“I-I just want *any* explanation, Charlie.” She admitted, crossing her arms. 

“I’m sorry… so do I. But this is… this is not it. You of all people should know that.”

“I know… I know. I-it’s ridiculous.” She tried to tell herself. “Let’s just… stop talking about this right now. I don’t… I can’t think about it anymore.”

As if on queue, our waitress returned with two steaming plates of breakfast classics. We ate quickly, barely taking breaks between bites. It had felt like I’d already been up a whole day, I couldn’t even imagine how it felt for Audrey. 

After eating, we stepped out of the diner and into the crisp morning air. I dug in my pocket and pulled out my car key, the amber lights of the little gray sedan flashing as I tapped the unlock button. The car wasn’t exactly a chick magnet but it was free after all, and who turns down something that's free?

Audrey and I buckled in and I started up the engine. It puttered to life and I threw the shifter in drive. I looked over at her for a moment. She seemed deep in thought. She hadn’t said more than a few words since I told her the story of the Weeping Widow. I was worried about her. And I’d been kicking myself for even mentioning the damn legend in the first place. 

“H-hey are you alright? You haven’t spoken since we ate.” I asked, deciding to break the silence as we rounded a corner onto the aptly named School Street. 

“I uh… I’ve just been thinking about everything I guess.” She replied, still not fully present as she stared out the window.

“You’re still thinking about the Weeping Widow.” I concluded. She didn’t respond, just kept her eyes on the moving greenery outside. “We need to start thinking seriously, Audrey.”

“I’m being dead fucking serious, Charlie. What happened to my dad… I can’t fucking explain. There’s nothing, no logical explanation for why or how it happened.” She took a deep breath. “Listen, if you don’t want to keep going in this direction with me, that’s fine. But after school, I’m going to go to the library and see if there’s anything about those disappearances you mentioned. O-or about the Widow herself. Just… just anything to help.”

I swung the car into a parking spot in the student lot and slid the shifter in park. The car rested and I shut off the engine, pulling the key from the ignition. Then, I turned to face her.

“Look, I-I’m not leaving your side. You roped me into it, now you’re stuck with me. For better or for worse. I honestly doubt we’re going to find anything at the library but… who the fuck knows. Maybe I’m wrong.” I insisted. 

“R-really? You’ll come with me?” She asked, a bit of surprise and a hint of relief in her voice.

“Yeah. The fact that you came to me of all people last night for help… I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night knowing I just abandoned you when you needed my help.” I admitted. Her face brought out a small smile.

“Thanks, Charlie. That um… that means a lot.”

As we walked through the doors of Hillsboro-Deering High School, a strange feeling hung over me. Everyone was oblivious to what had happened last night. And yes, of course they would be. Neither Audrey nor I had said a word to anybody. Despite that, it still felt as thought we were hiding something. We had to pretend that everything was fine. I’d never had to fake how I acted on an everyday basis. And as the doors shut behind us, we both had to relearn to be ourselves.

“I’ll catch you in class, I-I see Carl at his locker.” Audrey told me, separating from me as she weaved through the morning rush to reach her boyfriend. Carl Pearson was Hillsborough’s future baseball team captain. He’d always been surprisingly nice, ever since we were kids. I wouldn’t say I was ever exactly friends with the guy but he wasn’t that typical athlete either. He and Audrey had started dating at the end of Freshman year and they seemed happy together. Today however, one half would be genuine while the other tried desperately to be.

I was knocked out of my own daze by Ben, one of my best friends. He’d probably tried texting me a hundred times since last night but I didn’t even bother trying to respond. 

“Charlie, what the hell dude where have you been? Didn’t you get any of my texts?” He asked with a bit of playful annoyance in his voice. It took a minute for me to answer, my mind starting to slow as the lack of sleep was finally catching up with me.

“I um… y-you know I had work, man. Roger would’ve fired me.” I tried to explain.

“Oh yeah, but what about after? Kyle and I went out to the pond last night. You missed out dude, these seniors brought a full 24 pack. It got crazy.”

I tried to crack a smile as if I was honestly interested. “I’m sure it was, I-I guess I was just really tired last night.”

“I get it dude, it's all good.” Ben assured me. “You know what was the craziest part though? We heard some actually scary noises out in the woods last night. Sounded like nothing I’ve ever heard before. Then again, I had a couple in me already.”

My eyes widened. “W-wait, what? When did you hear those sounds? Where did they come from?” I asked a little frantically, losing my cool quickly.

“I-I don’t know, man. It was kind of late.” He stopped to think for a moment. “After ten if I were to guess. Probably came from up at Thompson Hill. That’s where those rednecks live around Kimball Corner.”

I didn't want to believe it but there was no denying it was a damn perfect coincidence. My brain ran a million miles a minute as Ben looked at me a little confused.

“A-are you alright, Charlie?” He asked. “You look like you saw a ghost.”

“It’s been uh… I-I had a rough night. That’s all.” I admitted, suppressing my thoughts. He smirked.

“I saw you walk in with Audrey Sheppard this morning. What was all that about?” He asked slyly. I rolled my eyes.

“Come on man, we've already had this conversation. She just um… needed a ride this morning. Something about her dad not being able to take her.” I tried to explain. He laughed.

“Sure buddy, whatever you say. I wouldn’t want to get on Carl’s bad side either.”

I shoved him playfully, “You can be such a dick sometimes.”

“I know, I pride myself on it.” He admitted.

The school day felt longer than any other I could remember. After first period, I felt like a zombie, roaming aimlessly through the day and simply existing to fill my seat. In chemistry, Audrey and I didn’t say a word to each other the entire time. She dozed off at least three times and I was becoming dangerously close myself. Dr. Karper didn’t seem to notice as our seats were in the back row but I had designated myself as the lookout just in case. 

When the day ended, Audrey was waiting for me at my car. She yawned as she leaned against the hood, arms crossed. Her eyes were heavy and her expression tired.

“That was…” She started.

“Awful” I finished. “Do you still want to-”

“Absolutely.” She cut me off, answering before I could even finish my sentence. Without another word, we took our seats in the car. I started it up, the engine’s hum filling the cabin as we pulled back out of the parking lot and onto School Street.

The Hillsborough Library wasn’t far from the school, then again everything in town was fairly close together. Within only a few turns and a couple more minutes, we’d parked behind the old building. The library was housed in a huge old yellow Victorian, with white trim and a stone brick foundation. A sign hung from the stairs of the long wrapping porch that read “Fuller Public Library” along with a sagging banner that used to display “Book Fair” but now much of it was illegible.

The entire school day I’d been in a daze, thinking about what Ben had mentioned to me before the first bell. It had to be just a coincidence but I also had to admit, it scared me a little more than I would’ve liked. The thought of mentioning it to Audrey made me even more worried she’d completely accept that a monster had stolen her father for seemingly no reason. But despite my reservations, I knew I had to break the news to her.

“So um… after we split up this morning” I started.

“Yeah?” She replied, pushing open the tall wooden door into the library’s main lobby.

“I-I was talking to Ben and um… he was out late last night at the Pond and well” I paused. Audrey gave me a confused look. “Well he said that they heard some… sounds coming from up on Thompson Hill.” Her tired expression immediately switched.

“D-did they say what ti-”

“It was after ten. At least that was his guess. He didn’t really describe what he heard but it seemed like whatever it was really freaked him out.” I admitted.

“Charlie y-you know that almost perfectly lines up with-”

“You don’t need to remind me. I just don’t want you to jump to any conclusions. It’s weird, yes but that’s assuming that anything about a local folk story is true.” I insisted.

“I know, that’s why we’re here anyway. So um… where do you think the town records would be?” She questioned. I shrugged.

“Beats me, I haven’t been in this place since middle school. I guess we could ask somebody at the desk.” 

The lady working at the checkout desk seemed ancient, as if she had sat in that same spot for a hundred years or more. This building was her domain and she was simply giving us the privilege to roam its halls. She watched us approach without lifting her head, her eyes tracing our path as we approached her. She spoke to us in short bursts, her words quiet but being heard loud and clear. She was skeptical when we asked to see Hillsborough’s records, like we were asking to see the crown jewel of her treasure hoard. With a bit of convincing from Audrey however, the old lady reluctantly agreed to take us to the records room. 

She hobbled off her chair and grabbed a comically large ring of keys. They jingled in her hand as we slowly followed her up the stairs to the second floor of the converted mansion. Reaching a solid dark wood door, she stopped short and began fishing for the right key. With a look of satisfaction, she took an old iron key and stuck it into the lock of the door, twisting it as the door opened with a satisfying click. Instructing us to lock the door when we left, she gave the room a long scan with her eyes before leaving us alone on the second floor. 

The records room was not large, likely an old bedroom when the building had been a house. Now it was a plainly painted room littered with filing cabinets, computers and scanning machines. We split the small space in half, trying to compile as much information as we could about the town’s urban legend. To be honest, I’m not sure exactly what drove me to dig through countless files for what was starting to feel like at least an hour. Audrey’s purpose was clear but my own I couldn’t quite place. I wanted to help my friend, that was obvious enough. But I suppose my own curiosity was starting to get the best of me. And in the back of my mind, a doubt was starting to grow about how confident I was that nothing of the story was true. Perhaps I’d just told myself so many times it wasn’t real, I simply started to believe it.

We’d occasionally snatch a document from one of the drawers or save a file on the computer but much of what we found had very little to do with the Weeping Widow. Audrey compiled everything on one of the open desks, laying out the documents in a rough chronological order in record time. Sometimes I forgot how smart she was and more importantly how lucky I was to have her as a lab partner. I’d be screwed without her.

We looked over everything, trying to put together some kind of pattern. Most of the documents were old, black and white newspaper clippings long yellowed and curling in the corners. Audrey had focused on trying to find any mention of the story from 1917, the supposed date of the event itself. I was more interested in putting together the missing persons cases I remember my parents telling me about. 

There was seldom mention of the Weeping Widow by name minus a couple of opinion pieces dating from the 1970s as well as a “Weird History” section of New Hampshire Magazine dating from the late 1990s. But after looking over everything, especially taking notice of the missing persons cases, lost hikers and uncovered remains, we both started to notice a pattern. We searched up the victims, some being Hillsborough residents along with a couple of tourists or travelers. They mostly lived very different lives, some from very different parts of the county and all from different times in the past century. But one thing was the same amongst them all. They had all lost their husbands or their wives.

Audrey looked up at me with a sense of fear in her eyes as we both came to that same conclusion. I gave her a confused reaction.

“W-what are you so nervous about? Doesn’t look like there's been a case like this in twenty years. It’s a weird coincidence, sure but-” I started nonchalantly, tossing one of the files onto the table.

“My dad… my dad was-*is*… he is a widower” She admitted, sinking into the chair behind her. “My stepmom Debra… she died when I was 13. That’s actually why my Dad moved us to Hillsborough. I guess he couldn’t stand living in the same house they’d shared together.”

I didn’t respond, quietly taking a seat next to her. Audrey quietly started to cry, overwhelmed with more emotion than I could imagine. I tried my best to comfort her, my own thoughts racing a thousand miles a minute. This still had to be just a big coincidence. It had to be. Monsters aren’t real. This is Hillsborough, not Transylvania. But I had to admit, I was curious. I wanted to say I knew the Weeping Widow wasn’t real. I wanted to say it without a shadow of a doubt. But somewhere deep in the back of my mind there was a doubt. And it worried me.

We didn’t stay in the records room much longer. We’d copied whatever documents we found important enough and quickly went for the exit. The sun was fleeting in the sky as we made our way back to the car. We each pulled open our respective doors and sat down, the whistling wind outside being snuffed out as we encased ourselves inside. There was a long silence, both of us having the same thought but clearly nervous to admit it to each other.

“We have to look for it.” Audrey finally spoke, a measure of insistence in her voice.

“W-what?” I asked in clarification.

“The Widow’s house. W-we need to rule it out. Let’s be honest, if we don’t just go up there and prove to ourselves that there’s nothing in that forest, it’s going to be in the back of our minds forever.” She explained. I knew she was right. But I also knew she didn’t really believe what she was saying. And neither did I.

1jj88iy,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jj88iy/bipolar_spiritual_delusions/,Bipolar spiritual delusions?,"Hi everyone,

I am writing here because I don’t know where else to go or what to do. I also posted in the bipolar subreddit but was taken down because I myself do not have bipolar disorder. However, my mental health is suffering due to this situation. 

My husband was not a spiritual or religious person previously. Within the last year he has become heavily influenced by these new age spiritual ideas such as “twin flames” “starseeds” “astrology” and “kundalini awakening” to name a few.

Here’s a little backstory: In June of last year (3 months after we got married), he thinks he met his “twin flame” via a dating website that he downloaded to “get a dopamine rush to stay awake on a long drive for work.” They have never met in person as far as I know, but he believes this person or soul to be his “twin flame” because he felt an explosion is his body while talking to her. He thinks this “explosion” was his “point of no return” and that she caused a spontaneous kundalini awakening.

Since then, he has been OBSESSED with all of these new age spiritual ideas to the point where he cannot focus on anything other than “grounding” himself and reading online materials about these topics. He sits in the spare bedroom or at coffee shops all day every day researching these topics.

We have 4 year old twins and there has been a significant decline in the time he spends with them and me. He has said that he doesn’t care about anything that he cared about before his awakening. Materials no longer matter and the 3D world is just an illusion. He has since had this idea that I (his wife and mother of his children) am a “codependent distraction” from the 5D spiritual world.

His behaviors are polar opposite of the person I married. He believes he is a better person for all of this but from my point of view he has turned into someone with narcissistic tendencies.

Does new age spiritualism seem cultish to anyone here? Could this be consistent with bipolar disorder? I feel like this has brainwashed him into not taking accountability for his actions. He believes that he has no free will. That whatever is supposed to happen is going to happen. Nothing matters to him anymore. Family and people don’t matter to him anymore. It’s all about the stars and vibrations and soul ties.

Edit: I feel like I should add that he started dosing himself with steroids to “get big” right before our wedding. I told him I didn’t think that was a good idea. I also vividly remember telling him that if he starts acting differently we know why. His dad took steroids in his early 20s and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder shortly after. So, there is a family history of mental illness enhanced by steroid use. His dad became aggressive, but since he is not physically aggressive he doesn’t believe he has a mental disorder.",1,1742867000.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

As early as the Ottoman period, Jewish merchants cultivated relationships with other ethnic and religious groups, shaping Baghdad’s economic landscape through textile, banking, and import-export ventures. The area’s narrow alleyways hosted shops selling everything from rugs and spices to gold jewelry—a reflection of the city’s cosmopolitan character. According to the [Jewish Virtual Library](), these commerce-driven interactions fostered a sense of relative coexistence, as Jewish entrepreneurs worked alongside Muslim and Christian neighbors. It was not uncommon for local families to reside in multi-story homes overlooking winding streets, with a synagogue or small beit midrash (study hall) a short walk away.

Religious and educational institutions lay at the Quarter’s heart. **Midrash Talmud Torah**, among other schools, served as focal points for Jewish learning, whether through the study of Hebrew texts or Baghdadi Judeo-Arabic translations of biblical passages. From the mid-nineteenth century onwards, outside organizations such as the Alliance Israélite Universelle helped modernize curricula, teaching subjects like French and arithmetic alongside traditional Torah study. Meanwhile, Baghdadi synagogues preserved a unique liturgical style shaped by local musical traditions and Gaonic influences—a heritage rooted in the centuries-long presence of major Talmudic academies (Sura, Pumbedita) within what is now modern Iraq ([Nissim Rejwan, *The Jews of Iraq*]()).

Social life in the Quarter centered on communal festivities, weddings, and holiday celebrations. Families often observed Jewish holidays with a distinctly Iraqi flair—for instance, cooking tebit (an overnight chicken-and-rice stew) for Shabbat, or reciting sections of the Passover Haggadah in Judeo-Arabic for maximum accessibility. Oral histories compiled by [Sephardi Voices](https://sephardivoices.com) recount the warmth and closeness among residents who would routinely drop by neighbors’ homes for coffee, conversation, and impromptu gatherings. Within these houses, women managed bustling kitchens while children mingled in courtyards, forging friendships that cut across socio-economic strata.

Political and social upheaval in the mid-twentieth century, culminating in the Farhud of 1941 and subsequent waves of anti-Jewish sentiment, dramatically altered the Quarter’s fate. Most Jews left Baghdad between 1950 and 1952, under Operation Ezra and Nehemiah, effectively emptying the district of much of its population. Over time, synagogues were repurposed or fell into disuse, with only traces of Hebrew inscriptions or architectural features attesting to their former significance. Despite these losses, initiatives like the [Diarna Geo-Mapping Project](https://diarna.org/) strive to document remaining landmarks, such as former synagogues, communal halls, and cemeteries, preserving digital records of a storied past for future generations.",1,1742866727.0,IraqiJews,0,1.0,False

Hey there! This is my first time on this reddit, but I'll try to write out enough information for readers to get a good idea of me.



If you're TLDR: If you lack sleep, but love to just hang out and talk for long hours without judgement, joke around, or even discuss deep topics-I'm probably your guy! I'm pretty smart! One important thing I also wanna mention though. I'm looking for people who 'actually' seek genuine friendship though. Not 'greet, then never remeet' like a buffet. Look, if we don't get along, it's all good. But at least be 'trying', ya know. I'm not too big a fan of shallow circles-Quality beats quantity! Friendship is a two way street.



That out the way...!



About my character: I'm near impossible to offend, so if you're a joker, it's totally fine and welcome. If not, and you love to talk about deeper subjects, that's also welcome and fine. If you're shy or insecure, but wanna branch out and learn more about people-you're more common than you know! I'm American but have traveled and lived over a decade literally around the world; from Asia, to Europe, to the Middle East-so I have tons of stories to tell or even traveling advice is you want! I've probably been to close to 12 countries or more.



I love Japan and Japanese culture! Even the weeby stuff. I can talk about anime, but don't expect me to know 'so' many. I mostly just watched the older stuff like .Hack/Sign, Cowboy Bebop, Naruto Shippuden, Violet Evergarden, Your Lie in April, Ghost in the Shell, Samurai Champloo, out the top of my head. I've watched some dramas, both J-Drama and K-Drama, and 'anime movies' as well. If you wanna show me stuff to watch together and talk about, just know I'm picky, but if it's good I'll watch it! Haha



Personally wise, I can be amazingly funny (Depending how high your tolerance is!). I can keep a convo rolling, and also spark them fine and well, so long as the conversation has a form of reciprocation. (Don't be an utter potato-partial one's are acceptable though!) Do you like conversations even outside just the current games were playing? How about Gaming Theory and Philosophy or even Philosophy itself? Or life! Want to learn people? I'm (mostly!) good with them! I can be a shoulder to lean on or learn from, so long as we don't go down TOO negative lane on a daily basis, ya know. Sometimes is alright though!



I've mostly grown tired of COOP games (CURRENTLY, anyways. Hopefully newer, more interesting ones we can play together will release in the future. Gaming market is pretty, oof, these day, ya know?) I've done a LOT of League of Legends-my heart can't take anymore! I also played FFXIV for YEARS. I was deep into the RP community too! Second most recent was Throne and Liberty, but I burnt through all the content and left during the drought. Granblue Fantasy Relink-also ran through the content! Latest has been MONSTER HUNTER WILDS! Love the game-but waiting on next tier difficulty drop! If you're really into it, I don't mind logging in for a few hunts though. Just know I won't be as passionate since I farmed everything haha.



These days I'm just buying random games on Steam. Lately has been Assassin's Creed Shadows. Before that has been Trails of Dawnbreak II, Final Fantasy Rebirth...(I still need to beat Final Fantasy Rebirth.) And there is a massive list of unfinished just...sitting there. If you have games you like to stream and talk during, wanna watch mine, or just wanna vibe, it's all good.



Games close to my heart: Nier series-and ELDEN RING! Yes. Now I'm also waiting on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Stellar Blade, and Elden Ring NIGHTREIN (WE CAN PLAY THIS TOGETHER)



What's the summary? Be chill, use common sense, and we get along! Super easy right? Coffee is my addition.",0,1742866377.0,discordfriends,1,0.5,False

No matter what you do when you’re up you can’t shake the weight of fear from your chest. The images and sounds bounce in your head. I used to get them frequently. Mostly as a child and very rarely as an adult. Usually if I have a nightmare it’s usually something very realistic, a car crash, I forgot to turn in an assignment for one of my classes, or I am talking with someone, but can’t say the right things. But there has only been one nightmare, if I can even call it a nightmare, that grips me to the core and sends shivers down my spine till this day.

  


I was 19 living in my first apartment with my brother. This apartment was nothing special, 2 floors. The 1st floor with a small living room and even smaller kitchen. The 2nd floor offered 2 bedrooms. One right in front of the top of the stairs and the second down a narrow hallway. My room was the one in front of the stairs. The stairs creaked at every step. I could hear if anyone was going up or down those awful stairs.

  


I decided to retire to my bed early that night. Long before my brother or his girlfriend. It was still light outside. Nothing unusual, a boring, and uneventful start of the night.

  


My body became heavy and the breath became slower and deeper. Sleep wrapped me up for a time. I was awoken by the sound of footsteps and creaks on the stairs, I hate those stairs chirping no matter how hard you try to sneak. Low whispers as my brother and his other half tiptoed making their way past the flimsy door of my room. The light from a flashlight illuminated their way, which casted the shadows of their feet under the space between the floor and the door. Their shadows glided past, the illumination showing their presence quickly trailing behind them. Dark once more outside my door. I checked the clock, 10pm. Thank goodness I thought it was much later. I turn myself over and pull blankets that were just thick enough to keep the cold air of Ellensburg Washington winters from touching my bones. The weight of sleep swept me into a slumber a 2nd time for the night.

  


A sudden jolt of my body awakened my mind. My body is moving on its own, I’m just an observer. I sense my legs kicking at the once comforting blanket, which had turned into the tangles of a net, catching a frightened animal. My hands claw at the fabric trap around my legs. Once free, before my consciousness comprehended that my legs were liberated, my feet were planted on the floor. My heart pounded in my ears, my hands shook, my breath shallow and fast. It was like I awoke from a nightmare, but I don’t remember having any dreams as I slept. Did I have a nightmare?

  


I paced around the room in the dark for a moment. Uneasiness was over me, why did I jump out of bed? What was I afraid of? My mind raced with thoughts, what felt like minutes, was only seconds. As I stood shaking in the dark, a light illuminated under the door, but was brighter than earlier, like it was directed towards the door, and shadows of feet passed. The stairs chirped, the light remained. Was my brother coming to check on me, I thought. Without hesitation I grabbed the knob of the door, gave it a twist, and yanked the door open. Where once was light on the other side illuminating the ground of the room, was now darkness in front of me. Light was just here, as I opened the door it was right there, but now it isn’t. Is my mind playing tricks on me? Where was my brothers whose feet I thought were casting dark paths across my floor? He must have gone down the stairs, I heard the groan of a step before coming out. In darkness, with my head bent and my eyes straining at the darkness below, I searched for the short banister to aid me in a swing towards the railing.

  


Just a step before the edge the stairs leading to the lower level, which was just as dark as where I currently was, with my neck still bent to the floor, a bluish green glow from above my vulnerable stooped crown, illuminated the ground.

  


Bare feet, pale and dry, stood before me. The hem of a rob, tattered and frayed slightly swaying above these feet of an unknown. My eyes followed up the wrinkles of this rob that at one point must have been white, but what was in front of me, looked gray, but somehow glowing with a blue and green hue that illuminated the walls around. An arm at each side that dangled, no movement in any kind of way. Long slender hands looking to belong to a woman consisted of the same color and texture of the feet. The nails at the end of each finger were chipped as well, but the long, curved and yellow. The palms faced my direction, put unmoving. As my head still followed up this body, taking in the sight of this robe, the shoulders appeared. Dark, greasy, long, and black hair that covered the neck of this one in front of me. Impossibly tall for a person, towering over me by at least 2 feet.

  


A woman’s face looked down at me. Her features almost human. A nose that was much too small, a head that was too long, a mouth that swirled around, almost like someone vaguely described a smile to someone who has never smiled before and tries to imitate. A top of her head lay a crown, green ribbon suspended in air like wind was lifting them up. I felt no concern seeing this body, until my eyes met her gaze. The sensation of electricity shooting through my body. My heart stopped, the air in my lungs quickly went cold. The whites of her eyes so large like you see in an animal who is afraid. Dark wide pupils unwavering held me.

  


A long slender hand stretched out towards me slowly. Holding an outstretched hand like a mother would to her child. This unhuman entity was inviting me to follow. To where I don’t know. Still stricken with fear, I turned away, stepped into my room, and closed the door. I crawled back into bed, in complete disbelief of what I saw. A scratch on the other side of the door from a single nail announced the presence was still near. Under the door the green and blue light glowed. I’m trapped in my room, there’s no way for me to run, I can’t even yell out, my voice has no strength. I don’t want to see this sickening glow ilumminating the room. I flip over on the mattress to face the wall, my back now to the door. 

  


Many voices spoke behind the door. Not yelling, not coherent entirely. Almost as though it was the sound of a busy coffee shop, with many talkative customers all having their own conversation, but all with the same voice. All with the sound of a woman who has chronically smoked her entire life. “You’ve denied to take my hand. But won’t you open the door for me?” My stomach turned at the question. I responded back, “I’m tired now. I’m going to sleep.” 

  


The light grew dimmer, a creak from the steps. Complete darkness, silence, absence of any other in my room or the hallway. Sleep for a 3rd time fell over me that night.",3,1742866332.0,TrueScaryStories,0,1.0,False

Anyways, just struggling to navigate friendship into adulthood and feeling a bit clueless and also just down about it. I know it can be hard in general but I’m wondering if I’m also just hopeless in a way.

First, I’ve never been great at making/keeping friends due to being shy all my life. I know in the past it has made people think I’m standoffish. I don’t know if I still appear that way tbh, but now I just worry I come off as very bland, boring, and even uncomfortable to be around if I’m awkward.

I’m not like this at all with family or my husband. My husband tells me I’m a socially anxious extrovert lol. And I have made a lot of progress since my childhood. Weirdly enough, it’s almost easier socially now in my mid 20s, despite not having school to naturally/easily bond me to people. 

Anyways, I do put myself in social situations. Right now for example, I’m attending a couple groups at church for young adults/young women. I also joined a book club and do catch up with a couple old friends who live farther away occasionally and met a few local women through social media-though I only really see one of them regularly now.

My issue: for example I do gravitate towards a few people now that I go regularly to these groups and see them there and it’s great, I usually feel energized afterwards. But… I don’t know how to… ask them for their number for or ask them if they want to get coffee or do something over the weekend. I’m terrified of the rejection, that they don’t actually want to be my friend. For some reason that kind of rejection feels so much more painful than romantic for example… I also interact with some of them more in group settings and am not usually the life of the group, so I wonder if they’d think it would be awkward or boring if it was just the two of us… obviously ok with doing stuff in groups too, but it feels like another step to invite multiple people if I don’t know who can actually make it. And I understand rejection might be part of the game as well that I have to just not take personally.

Also… I feel really sad sometimes when it seems other people are connecting so easily and quickly and exchanging numbers after meeting once or just becoming tighter with other people in the same group. I know not everyone will vibe and that’s normal(and I’m certainly not as drawn to some people as others), but I worry that I just can’t have that connection with anyone because I’m me and that everyone else is more likeable.

I (27, female) worked in the company's data and archive section as part of a 10-person team. Let's call my female coworker Lisa (not her real name) and my male coworker Kevin (not his real name). I worked at the company for almost three years, and I was hired around the same time as Kevin. However, Lisa was hired about a year before us, making her our senior. Seniority is a serious thing in Asia.

After a few years, since Kevin and I started at the same time, we became close friends. We completed projects together, did tasks around the office together, sometimes had lunch together, and since Kevin always drove to work, I often got a ride to the nearest train station with him. I live near the train station, so I only needed to take the train for four stops.

I admit that I became very close to Kevin, possibly because we are the same age. However, our relationship was completely platonic. Kevin was engaged to his fiancée, whom I knew very well, Kevin’s fiancée and I often hung out or had dinner together. His fiancée was perfectly fine with our friendship.

However, Lisa hated it. Initially, I thought she just had a crush on Kevin, but her feelings ran deeper. She was head over heels for him, making Kevin very uncomfortable at work. When Lisa realized that I seemed too close to Kevin, she became jealous and started spreading rumors about us having an affair behind Kevin's fiancée's back. She even accused Kevin of gaslighting her because he flirted with her and then flirted with me, despite being engaged to another woman.

Lisa managed to gather fake evidence to bring Kevin and me down, including photoshopped inappropriate photos of us. Although some of the photos were real, such as when Kevin and I walked out of the café in front of the office to got our coffee or when I got into his car when he gave me a ride.

The entire office, not just our team, started gossiping about us and avoiding us to the point where it affected our work. I thought that eventually, the HR department would get wind of it, but it turned out that Lisa had reported us to HR with the fake evidence she made. We were called in and served with a warning letter for inappropriate behavior and were threatened with termination if we didn't distance ourselves.

That was one of the hardest times of my life. My job was in disarray, and my office life was miserable. I heard whispers and cynical glances everywhere I went. I became extremely tired and considered resigning. However, Kevin said that if I gave up, it would mean I was admitting to everything Lisa had accused us of. He suggested we fight back and provide HR with real evidence to clear our names.

We started collecting sources for Lisa's photoshopped photos and a statement letter from Kevin's fiancée stating that we were not in an inappropriate relationship. Initially, our proof was rejected because one of the HR representatives was Lisa's senior college friend. However, since we continued to submit the real photos that had been edited, HR finally accepted our evidence, and Lisa was called in.

I heard she cried at the HR office and was fired on the spot for causing a massive disturbance at work, fabricating false evidence, and slandering colleagues. At first, I was satisfied because my name was cleared, and my office life returned to normal after my other coworker apologized for trusting her without verifying the facts with me

But because I was petty, when I heard she got hired at another company about eight months after being fired, I emailed the HR department about her behavior towards me, and she got fired again.

The last I heard, she moved to another city because every company in our field knew her reputation. Kevin and his fiancée got married and are expecting a child now. I'm planning my wedding for next summer with my coworker, who initially sympathized with me and reached out first.

However, I recently received angry and threatening messages from Lisa, claiming that her reputation was ruined and she struggled to find a job because I kept messaging her new office. Am I wrong to have gone to such lengths with my pettiness?",7,1742866082.0,AITAH,7,0.9,False

The bullpen buzzed with its usual chaos — phones ringing, voices rising, paperwork flying. Detective Adriana Quinn sat back at her desk, pretending to read through emails while Detective Oliver Beckham balanced on the edge of it, sipping his coffee like they weren’t mid-gossip.
“How are you feeling about the fed the captain is bringing in from that new FBI joint initiative bullshit?” Oli asked between sips of his coffee. 
Adriana slumped back in her chair and buried her head in her hands for a moment and groaned. “It’s only gonna cause problems and slow us down. You know how those guys are. They drag their feet and take all the credit for doing absolutely nothing.” 
As she continued, the elevator at the other end of the bullpen dinged as the doors opened. A man stepped out wearing a dark blue sweater, black jeans and sneakers. A total contrast to the swarm of uniformed officers and professional looking Detectives. He paused just outside the elevator, eyes scanning the room. Everyone looked busy. Uniforms, badges, hard faces. Then he spotted two detectives mid-conversation — the woman’s voice low, unimpressed. Maybe they’d know where to point him, Calum thought as he approached cautiously. He lingered a few feet from Adriana’s desk and observed their conversation. 
“Honestly, I hope he’s just some desk jockey pencil pusher who will leave us the hell alone.” Adriana finished.
“As long as they’re not some stuck-up know-it-all asshole, I really don’t care. Can’t be worse than any of the other douchebags we’ve had to put up with.” Oli added. 
Calum moved closer and interrupted. “Hi, I’m Agent Solace, Calum, if that’s easier. The aforementioned ‘douchebag.’” He extended his hand and gave Detective Beckham a quick handshake. He turned his attention and extended hand to Detective Quinn and flashed a smile. 
Adriana looked him up and down once, surprised by the casualness of his appearance and didn’t hide the judgment in her eyes. She didn’t say a word. Just stared. Long enough to make it uncomfortable.
He pulled back his hand and continued. “Right, do either of you know where I can find Captain Park?”
Beckham stood from the edge of the desk and pointed to the office at the other end of the room. “Right in there. Good luck, bud.” He gave Calum a quick pat on the shoulder, then retook his seat on Quinn’s desk. 
Calum gave them both a warm smile and thanked them as he made his way to the Captain’s office. As he walked away, he couldn’t help but glance back. Her silence tugged at something in him. It made him hesitate, like he wasn’t supposed to walk away yet.

In 2022 I moved into my brother’s house after a breakup.  I worked remotely at the time and set my desk up in front of a large window facing the street.  The lady across the street was a live-in caregiver, we’ll call her Maddox.  The neighbor next to the house lived in a duplex, we’ll call him Alex.  Maddox and Alex would call the police on each other about twice a week.  A few times a week I would hear yelling and look up to see the shouting matches.  Many F bombs and finger flipping happened over time.  Once Maddox emptied Alex’s trash can all over his yard.  She also managed to turn the water off to his duplex.  They threw rocks at each others houses every now and again.  The cops were there so many times.  I get up early one morning before sunrise and go outside to smoke and drink coffee.  I see Maddox sneaking out the front door of Alexes house.  He comes out with her, gives her a kiss and she heads home.  I’m thinking are you serious!?  The same bickering, fighting and cop calling continues for the next few weeks and I continue to see them sneaking out of each other’s houses before sunrise.  One morning the police and a detective show up while I’m outside.  Neither Maddox or Alex answer their doors.  The detective walks into our yard and asks if I know anything about the neighbors across the street.  Sure enough, I told them I knew they were secretly seeing other because I could see them sneaking out of each other’s houses.  The detective shook his head and left.  The crazy neighbors continued that behavior for a year and a half.

We broke up because she was leaving the country for 8 months. I was under the impression that we wouldn’t be dating but that communication would be upheld and we would see what happened when she got back. I was saving to visit her where she was moving and what not. A couple weeks before she left she said she thought we should not talk while she was gone. I was sooo mad. We had a big fight and didn’t talk for a couple days. After that we met up because we didn’t want to end on bad terms and we even did one more nice date before she left. The last time I saw her was her going away party where I had to leave because I was sad. I said I wanted to see her alone before she left and that never happened. She left for 8 months and I moved on (sorta). Then she got back and it kind of felt like the wound re-opened, she texted me asking hoe my summer had been, and I didn’t reply because I didn’t want to just be available when SHE needed me. We have mutual friends and live in a small town where we’ve run into each other a couple times. Every time I see her I panic and kinda just leave. I’ve also not gone to events/parties because I knew she’d be there. She reached out about 2 months ago asking to meet up 1-on-1 for coffee and catching up. I said that I wasn’t ready yet, but I wasn’t opposed to the idea in the future. I’ve been thinking about her so much lately and I miss her so much. I realize my short comings in how things ended, as I should’ve been more supportive of her upcoming chapter, and also, I wish she had been more understanding of my feelings as she was leaving for this great adventure and I was going to miss her.

I (27M) had a crush on a coworker (let’s call her J) for a while. We worked in different departments but interacted occasionally for work. Over time, we had playful banter, joked around a lot, and she always seemed warm when responding to me—adding extra letters in messages, using emojis, and never giving cold replies. But she never initiated conversations or asked me anything personal.

I played it slow, testing the waters. I sent her memes, teased her about work stuff, and tried to keep a friendly but slightly flirty vibe. She responded positively but never really engaged beyond that. She also left my Instagram follow request pending, which confused me.

Recently, I saw her at a work event, but it was too chaotic to have a real conversation. I briefly wished her good luck since she was leaving the company, and that was it. Now, she’s gone, and I never explicitly told her I liked her or asked her out. I keep wondering—**did I mess up by not being more direct?** Would asking her for coffee and straight-up telling her I liked her have changed anything? Or was she never interested, and I was just another friendly coworker in her eyes?

What would you guys have done in my situation? And do you think it’s worth sending a LinkedIn message now just to ask her for coffee? Or is it too late, and I should just take the L and move on?",1,1742865319.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

Recently I've found that it would be a good idea to meet new people or engage in new activities to broaden my horizons during my free time. I'm all about trying new things to see if it suits me.

**About Me**

I'm a grad student in biology and a lot of my time is spent in the field, labs, or doing research at random hours of the day. But apart from that I like to spend my time finding new ways to engage with all that's out there. I'm looking for friends who have similar interests or even different interests who might want to share them with someone. From cultural knowledge, games, books, stories, gardening, and more.

**Films & Anime**  
**Games / Video Games / Table Top Games**  
**Music**  
**Science**  
**Other Hobbies**

**Films & Anime**

I have always been a fan of films and the value they hold, one of my all time favorite films is 12 Angry Men, it's a classic I would say in many ways, I hope you find some time to watch it! Roman Holiday is a great one as well on top of things like Schindler's List, The Pianist, Gladiator, and many more. I recently watched a film called Time Still Turns The Page, and I think it's a wonderful film by Nick Cheuk (2023). These are some examples but I do enjoy genres like Slice of Life, Thriller, Intrigue, Fantasy (LoTR, etc), and anything with a beautiful story.

I've been watching anime since I was a kid as well and have seen so many series I've lost count. Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood and Kids on the Slope are on my all time favorite along with so many more. Mangas, oh man, it feels like I've read them all, but surely that can't possibly be. Berserk, Vagabond, Fairy Tail, One Piece, I mean this list would be too big. I enjoy most genres in this topic.

Happy to take recommendations!

**Games / Video Games / Table Top Games**

I do play video games and I have been since I was a kid. My all time favorites are those with impactful stories such as Baldur's Gate 3, The Last of Us, The Witcher, Final Fantasy (6, 7, 8, and more), Cyberpunk, Pathfinder, and more. But its not exclusive to those, I also enjoy other types of games like Space Marines 2, or Valheim, Minecraft, etc.

I do play a lot of tabletop games, I began playing D&D as a kid and have been a DM for just about 8 years now. This also includes games like Vampire: The Masquerade and board games like Catan, Munchkins, and more. I'd be up for some party play in D&D or Baldur's Gate, could be fun. If you're a DM or enjoy D&D we'd probably get along.

**Music**

I grew up with music in my life, I went to a school that promoted fine arts among its normal course load. I have performed across the world for various international platforms but no longer have the time to do so, it's been a a few years since I picked up my instruments. I play clarinet, trumpet, sax, and piano.

I absolutely love jazz music and it's the core of my music foundation along with classical and orchestral. The freedom of expression is what really attracts me. But then again, I also listen to pop, kpop, artists like Coldplay, Maroon 5, to Michael Bolton, and much more. I enjoy a whole range of genres and music but really love these jazzists; Art Blakey, Chet Baker, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, Bill Evans, Louis Armstrong, the list goes on.

Recently I've been into Spiritbox, STRFKR, Deftones, Phantogram, Loathe, Tame Impala, L'Impératrice and some more.

**Science**

This is a big part of who I am too. At the core, I'm an engineer and biologist. I keep tabs on the latest innovations and participate in events across the globe for synthetic biology and how it might shape the future. Science journals like Cell, Nature Ecology and Evolution, Frontiers of Marine Science are all great places to learn and discover about the world. iGEM is a great place to learn about synthetic biology, especially for high school and university students who want to engage themselves and their communities.

**Other Hobbies**

I'm a hobby writer. I've been writing a fantasy novel for a few years now that has been made into a tabletop game. It's being played as a DnD campaign with two separate parties of 2 and 3 years running. I enjoy getting up early and training at the gym next door, coffee in its freshest forms, I've taken a liking to cooking in the last 3 or 4 years and enjoy dabbling with recipes, books such as The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, Feed, A Wizard of Earthsea, The Way of Kings, and more.

With all that being said, it's nice to meet you. If we don't ever connect, then at least you've been left with a few things to explore on your own. If we do meet, then the pleasure is all mine and I hope you can tell me more about yourself too.

I had a very long time female best friend. I would always do everything for her. Buy her coffee, food, shoes. I would drive her places. I would shower her with compliments. But, she would never ever pick me as her man. Yet, she’d keep me around and send an occasional flirt to keep me going. At one point I was doing findom with an ex friend of hers. When she found out, she was pissed that I “cheated” on her with a person she didn’t like. After that, I told her I wanted to pay her and her first response was “why me”. It never panned out though 

Long story short, I simped for her years and the friendship ended. Now I’m having serious intrusive thoughts of texting her and telling her I want to give her 400 dollars a month.

1jj7gfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtohope/comments/1jj7gfp/fight_for_hope_ch_5/,Fight For Hope | Ch. 5,"The sun was beginning to go down in Flagstaff when the astronomers began trickling out of their offices. Scott Watson was slumped at one desk out of six in the office that the visiting astronomers shared, several books as thick as his arm scattered open across the desk, interspersed with a sea of papers annotated with scribbles and equations, and three separate coffee mugs. On one side of the office, the blinds on the windows just barely let the golden sunlight into the room; on the other side, a giant blackboard loomed large, every surface covered in diagrams and equations. Someone had drawn an alien poised as though writing one of the particularly gnarly differential equations.



As Scott stared idly at his screen, looking at a simulation tick by without really watching it, he was brought back to Earth by a knock on the door. It was George Boyle, the lead astronomer of the Lowell Observatory, a corpulent man in his late fifties. “Hey! New guy…uh…what’s your name again?” he said. “We’re getting a couple of drinks at the bar in town before we go up to the observatory. Wanna come? The IPA is to die for. Hell, it’s almost worth the twenty dollars a drink.” He chuckled at the last bit.



Scott tore his eyes away from the screen, stifling a yawn. “Yeah, sure. Let me just wrap up a few things,” he said, terminating the simulation and closing about a dozen arxiv tabs in rapid succession.



“Alright then. We’ll wait outside,” said Boyle. He took a couple of steps further into the room, glancing into a corner “…Oh! What about you, Lauren? Coming?”



A woman in her mid-twenties, wearing a hoodie, with long dark  hair framing her face, glanced at Boyle. “It’s fine. I actually found something really interesting to look at. I’ll meet you guys at the observatory tonight,” she said, then immediately went back to her work.



“Great! See you there,” said Boyle, giving her a thumbs-up before heading out, leaving the door slightly ajar behind him.



Scott finished closing his tabs and shut off the computer. Just as he was getting up to leave, he grabbed one of the papers on his desk and stood there skimming the conclusion, or at least trying to–the information stayed in his mind like water in a sieve. He sighed heavily and looked over at the woman in the corner. For some reason, his gaze seemed drawn to that part of the room. “You found something?” he asked.



“Mmhmm,” said Lauren, not looking up from her screen.



 Scott flashed her a smile. “Lucky you, I’ve got nothing.”



“Don’t worry about it. We’ve only been here a week,” said Lauren.



“Which means only eleven weeks left,” said Scott, “So…can I ask what you found?”



Lauren gave him an appraising look, then pulled out the chair next to her and said, “Sit.” He did so, looking at her screen, where a squiggly time series curve was displayed. “I was looking at this data from a broad night-sky sweep for signs of primordial black holes and I found this,” she said, tapping on the time series with a pen, “a faint X-ray emission, at the limits of our best detectors. I thought it was a glitch, but it was there for hours last night, until it went below the horizon.” She paused, leaning close to the screen, absently wrapping a lock of hair around one finger. Scott forcefully tore his eyes away from her face to look at the chart. “No. I lied. When I did some basic signal processing, I found that there were *two*, with intensity curves on the same order of magnitude, roughly a few milliarcseconds apart,” Lauren went on.



“Er…is this a common phenomenon?” asked Scott.



“No,” said Lauren flatly.



“Forgive me,” said Scott, “I’m just a humble planetary scientist, so I had to ask.”



“I know. I read a couple of your papers,” said Lauren with a half-smile.



“What? Why? Uh…I mean, thank you. Uh…I mean…” Scott trailed off into silence, his brain running full throttle for something intelligent to say.



“I was bored,” said Lauren simply. She sighed, turning to face Scott full on for the first time. “Do you know how many astrophysics papers do nothing but tweak one parameter in some theoretical model with no evidence?”



“I don’t think mine are that different,” admitted Scott, “It’s a numbers game. There’s never any time for pie-in-the-sky dream projects. Nor funding these days.”



“But you *do* have a pie-in-the-sky dream project in mind, right? Something you’d do if only the powers that be would let you? You seem like the type,” said Lauren, leaning forward intently.



“Biomolecule formation in interstellar space,” said Scott without missing a beat, “Maybe it could get us one step closer to figuring out if panspermia is real, if there’s any life out there, something like that…I don’t know.”



Lauren nodded. “Ambitious. I like it.”



“Do you have one?” asked Scott.



“I’d love to find a primordial black hole someday. I learned about them when I was eight. Always thought the idea was beautiful. Just these motes of dust as heavy as asteroids hiding throughout space like a trillion trillion ghosts.,” said Lauren, her voice hushed and her dark eyes  seeming to stare straight into Scott’s soul.



“Is this related to that?” said Scott, gesturing at the screen.



“Maybe. It could be from interstellar dust or gas interacting with a primordial black hole. I want to look more tonight, that’s why I had to take care of some other stuff before we go,” said Lauren.



“Oh, I thought it’s because we only have three months  here and you’re desperate to make every day count,” said Scott.



“That too.”  Lauren laughed.



“Or were you hoping to stay?” asked Scott.



“Nah, I’m going back to UC Berkeley to finish my PhD,” said Lauren.



“UC Berkeley? So you’re really a rising star!”



“Maybe a red dwarf. Just one of billions burning softly in the background for a while.”



“Or maybe an O-type star. The brightest and hottest,” said Scott, “and the ones that make their mark on the whole galaxy before long.”



Lauren giggled at that. “That’s a good one!” she said, fiddling with her hair while suddenly very preoccupied with the screen.



“Do you know how far away these X-ray emitters are?” asked Scott suddenly.



“No,” said Lauren, her expression sobering, “That’s what I wanted to look into next.”	Scott’s eyes flickered from her to the chart and back again. “Want any help? I’m stuck on my project anyway,” he said.



Lauren didn’t look away from the screen, but smiled slightly. “Sure. I’d like that. See you on the hill, Scott!” she said.",2,1742864697.0,roadtohope,0,1.0,False
1jj7fqa,https://i.redd.it/5wh2p7bd9qqe1.png,"35F, Total Cholesterol from 264 to 151 in 3 months with diet and exercise and quitting birth control pills","Thanks everyone on here for being so kind and helpful when I had stupid questions. In 3 months I brought my Total Cholesterol down from 264 to 151 by changing my diet and exercise and quitting birth control pills. My doctor was sure I had pure hypercholesterolemia but I wanted to try to fix it on my own before going on statins to see what I am capable of on my best behavior. The doctor did not help me with any of this I went off my own research.



What I changed: I was eating a lot of junk food, chips, candy, cookies, tv dinners, cheese, eggs, bready things. I lowkey have arfid and don't mind eating the same food every day. So my NEW diet generally was oatmeal with walnuts in the morning. My regular coffee with protein powder, almond milk, and 1 packet of sugar (I kept it the same, nothing changed here). For lunch I'd have a smoothie with spinach, 0 fat greek yogurt, blueberries, and 2 tsp chia seeds. For dinner I'd air fry salmon with olive oil. Or I'd air fry tofu with low sodium soy sauce. Or I'd have lentil pasta with tomato sauce. Quinoa was my go-to side dish. Snacks I'd have lentil chips with guac or lentil chips with hummus. Any fruits or veggies I wanted. My candy substitute was Dr. John's healthy sweets lollipops with xylitol in them. My chip replacement was roasted edamame beans (lots) and kettle corn pop corners (sparingly). I also found out my favorite dark chocolate had 9g of saturated fat per square so I stopped eating chocolate all together. My BMI stayed the same, I'm a little underweight. The price of a dozen eggs in California being $9+ helped me quit eggs haha. I miss cheese the most but the fear of my own blood was more powerful.



Exercise I used to do 1 hour slow walks on the treadmill and watch TV shows on my phone, really lazy about it. Now I do 30 minute fast paced walks to get my heart rate over 100 bpm. I get sweaty now and use the other 30 minutes to shower. So overall still an hour spent, but I read getting your heart rate up was important. I tried to do this daily. At worst I would not let 2 days go by without walking. If I didn't walk yesterday then I HAD TO today.



Lastly, I had been on the generic birth control for Yaz (3mg drospirenone / 0.02mg ethinyl estradiol) for 14 straight years. I was taking it continuously so I never had a period, it was amazing. But I suspected it was causing high cholesterol so I went off it. And I thought maybe my symptoms had mellowed out with age. Nope! This has been horrible. I am in severe pain, cramps keep me up all night, I'm nauseated, my hair is falling out, my face is broken out like a teenager's, the mood swings and anger are out of control. The time between my periods is as wonky as I remember and it's ruining my social life. I am on a good amount of psych meds and going off birth control has significantly set me back mentally. Therefore I'm going back on it... but I will be maintaining my new diet and new exercise. I'll retest lipids later this year and see if birth control was a problem or not and post an update.

Recently I've found that it would be a good idea to meet new people or engage in new activities to broaden my horizons during my free time. I'm all about trying new things to see if it suits me.

I'm a grad student in biology and a lot of my time is spent in the field, labs, or doing research at random hours of the day. But apart from that I like to spend my time finding new ways to engage with all that's out there. I'm looking for friends who have similar interests or even different interests who might want to share them with someone. From cultural knowledge, games, books, stories, gardening, and more.

**About Me**

**Films & Anime**

I have always been a fan of films and the value they hold, one of my all time favorite films is 12 Angry Men, it's a classic I would say in many ways, I hope you find some time to watch it! Roman Holiday is a great one as well on top of things like Schindler's List, The Pianist, Gladiator, and many more. I recently watched a film called Time Still Turns The Page, and I think it's a wonderful film by Nick Cheuk (2023). These are some examples but I do enjoy genres like Slice of Life, Thriller, Intrigue, Fantasy (LoTR, etc), and anything with a beautiful story.

I've been watching anime since I was a kid as well and have seen so many series I've lost count. Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood and Kids on the Slope are on my all time favorite along with so many more. Mangas, oh man, it feels like I've read them all, but surely that can't possibly be. Berserk, Vagabond, Fairy Tail, One Piece, I mean this list would be too big. I enjoy most genres in this topic.

Happy to take recommendations!

**Games / Video Games / Table Top Games**

I do play video games and I have been since I was a kid. My all time favorites are those with impactful stories such as Baldur's Gate 3, The Last of Us, The Witcher, Final Fantasy (6, 7, 8, and more), Cyberpunk, Pathfinder, and more. But its not exclusive to those, I also enjoy other types of games like Space Marines 2, or Valheim, Minecraft, etc.

I do play a lot of tabletop games, I began playing D&D as a kid and have been a DM for just about 8 years now. This also includes games like Vampire: The Masquerade and board games like Catan, Munchkins, and more. I'd be up for some party play in D&D or Baldur's Gate, could be fun. If you're a DM or enjoy D&D we'd probably get along.

**Music**

I grew up with music in my life, I went to a school that promoted fine arts among its normal course load. I have performed across the world for various international platforms but no longer have the time to do so, it's been a a few years since I picked up my instruments. I play clarinet, trumpet, sax, and piano.

I absolutely love jazz music and it's the core of my music foundation along with classical and orchestral. The freedom of expression is what really attracts me. But then again, I also listen to pop, kpop, artists like Coldplay, Maroon 5, to Michael Bolton, and much more. I enjoy a whole range of genres and music but really love these jazzists; Art Blakey, Chet Baker, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, Bill Evans, Louis Armstrong, the list goes on.

Recently I've been into Spiritbox, STRFKR, Deftones, Phantogram, Loathe, Tame Impala, L'Impératrice and some more.

**Science**

This is a big part of who I am too. At the core, I'm an engineer and biologist. I keep tabs on the latest innovations and participate in events across the globe for synthetic biology and how it might shape the future. Science journals like Cell, Nature Ecology and Evolution, Frontiers of Marine Science are all great places to learn and discover about the world. iGEM is a great place to learn about synthetic biology, especially for high school and university students who want to engage themselves and their communities.

**Other Hobbies**

I'm a hobby writer. I've been writing a fantasy novel for a few years now that has been made into a tabletop game. It's being played as a DnD campaign with two separate parties of 2 and 3 years running. I enjoy getting up early and training at the gym next door, coffee in its freshest forms, I've taken a liking to cooking in the last 3 or 4 years and enjoy dabbling with recipes, books such as The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, Feed, A Wizard of Earthsea, The Way of Kings, and more.

With all that being said, it's nice to meet you. If we don't ever connect, then at least you've been left with a few things to explore on your own. If we do meet, then the pleasure is all mine and I hope you can tell me more about yourself too.

1jj7d0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jj7d0w/the_reflection_part_4/,The Reflection [Part 4],"I don’t believe in ghosts. Or demons. Or whatever the hell is living in my mirror.

I tell myself this every morning. Every night. Every time I catch my reflection moving just a little too fast, a little too eager.

I don’t *want* to believe it.

But I can’t deny it’s been helpful.

The day after my reflection smiled at me, I braced for things to get worse. I expected more messages, more obvious horror movie bullshit. Instead, my life got… easier.

Little things at first. The coffee machine never runs out of filters. My bank account stays just above zero, even though I swear I was drowning in overdraft fees last week. My boss, who normally looks for any excuse to chew me out, suddenly can’t find a reason to reprimand me.

It’s like the universe flipped a switch in my favor. And if I hadn’t seen my own reflection lag behind me, hadn’t wiped please off my mirror, I’d call it good luck.

But I did see. And I did wipe it away. And now I can’t pretend this isn’t happening.

So I do the next best thing—I stop looking in mirrors.

I avoid them like a superstition, like walking under ladders or breaking glass. I shave without a reflection. I use my phone screen at an angle. I even keep the bathroom light off when I brush my teeth, just to be safe.

But then, the world starts slipping.

It’s subtle at first. A coworker calling me by a nickname I’ve never had. My apartment door being unlocked when I come home. Strangers looking at me like they almost recognize me.

And then, one night, I dream.

I’m standing in my bathroom, staring at the mirror, but my reflection isn’t me. It’s someone wearing my face, but their eyes are just a little too bright. Their posture, a little too relaxed.

They don’t mimic me. They don’t need to.

“*You look tired,*” they say. Their voice is my voice, but it doesn’t belong to me.

I don’t answer.

They tilt their head. “*I can make it easier. You know that, right?*”

I shake my head. “I don’t want your help.”

They smile. “*You already have it.*”

I wake up in a cold sweat, heart hammering. But the worst part isn’t the dream—it’s the fact that when I stumble into the bathroom, turn on the light, and finally let myself look in the mirror again…

I look good.

Not just good. Rested. Healthy. Like I haven’t been slowly unraveling for weeks.

And when I blink, for just a fraction of a second—

My reflection doesn’t blink with me.

“*Just let me help.*”

The voice isn’t in my head this time. It’s real. Close.

I don’t remember running out of the bathroom, but I do remember slamming the door shut behind me, my breath coming fast and ragged.

Because I know, deep down, I can’t ignore this anymore.

And worse?

I don’t know if I want to.

1jj7ba6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Webnovel/comments/1jj7ba6/how_do_you_guys_write_your_webnovels_im_stuck/,"How do you guys write your Webnovels? I’m stuck between AI and real-life struggles (Help me, I’m drowning here!)","Hey everyone! So, here’s my situation—I’m a university student studying cybersecurity (think endless coding, security protocols, and a whole lot of coffee), and I’ve been dreaming of publishing my webnovel on Webnovel for a while now. But... there’s a tiny little issue... time.

Let’s be real for a second. I love writing. I can’t stop thinking about my characters, my plot twists, and how I want to take readers on a rollercoaster of emotions. But then I look at my schedule and... yup, it’s just lecture after lecture, coding assignment after coding assignment, and let’s not forget about the dreaded group projects that no one asked for.

So, here’s my grand plan (stay with me here)

I thought about plotting my whole story in bullet points—super basic, just-the-highlights stuff like

“Arthur arrives at the academy and feels like he doesn’t belong.”

“Arthur meets mysterious figure who challenges his beliefs.”

Then, I’d send these basic bullet points over to an AI (like ChatGPT) and let it do the magic—transforming those bullet points into full, descriptive chapters. For example, this

The bullet point: “Arthur feels out of place at the academy.”

The AI version: “Arthur stepped into the grand hall of the academy, his heart pounding as the murmur of laughter and excited voices swirled around him. The polished floors gleamed like glass, and students moved with an air of confidence he could never have. He felt like an outsider in a sea of perfection, but he wasn’t backing down. Not yet.”

Now, I’d go through the AI’s version, trim the parts that sound weird, smooth out the awkward bits, and add my personal flair where needed. The result? A polished chapter without me needing to spend hours typing and revising every single sentence after a long day of classes.

Honestly, the dream is to not be chained to a desk writing chapter after chapter like a writing machine. I want to spend my energy on the creative parts fleshing out the plot, developing my characters, and making the story the best it can be. AI will handle the boring stuff (the description, the small details, the things I’m too tired to think about after a 10 hour day of lectures and coding).

But here’s my dilemma: Is this cheating? I mean, I’d still be doing the heavy lifting—plotting the story, creating the characters, making sure everything fits together. The AI is just there to help fill in the blanks. But I’m a little torn. Would this approach be frowned upon in the webnovel community? Would readers care? Would I lose that “personal touch” by having an AI help with the heavy lifting?

To give you context, I really want to keep the quality high for the characters, plot, and world-building. But I just don’t have the time to manually write every single word, especially when my brain is fried from cybersecurity assignments. (It’s all fun and games until you’re trying to secure a network after reading data packets for hours. 😅)

So here’s what I’m asking:

Should I just dive in, write my chapters manually, and accept the fact that I’ll be living off of caffeine and pure determination for the next few months?

Or is using AI a valid option to help speed up the process and keep the quality in check without losing my mind or my grades?

I really love writing, but I also don’t want to drop out of university. So, I need to find a balance, and I’m wondering if any of you have used AI this way or if it’s totally frowned upon. Maybe some of you have cracked the code on balancing writing and life (please tell me your secrets!).",1,1742864301.0,Webnovel,7,0.67,False

1jj7ao3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jj7ao3/i_awoke_in_a_strange_cabin_on_a_beach/,I awoke in a strange cabin on a beach.,"I’ve tried to forget, but I can’t. The memories keep slipping through. They tell me it wasn’t real. That I imagined it. But I know what happened. I need to tell someone before I forget again. I’ll recount everything as it’s still clear in my head. I’ll make another post to complete my account of the events, but due to my attempt to get everything here as descriptive as possible, I needed to split it in two. Please, if anyone has found themselves stretched close to death, have you found yourself in this strange place?



I awoke with a jolt, lurching upright in bed, gasping for air as if I had just surfaced from drowning. My chest heaved, my fingers clutched at the soft sheets beneath me- smoother, softer than anything I had ever slept on before. My head was spinning. The scent of fresh pine drifted through the air, carried by a cool spring breeze that rustled the white curtains. Sunlight streamed in, flooding the rustic wooden room with a warm glow.



I sat there, frozen, trying to piece together what had happened. The ship. The storm. Claire.  Wyatt. Theron. Was I dead?



A creak at the door made me snap my head toward it. A man stepped inside with gentle movements, his face kind yet unfamiliar. He had dark hair, streaked with gray at the temples, and deep-set wrinkles that framed his kind, smile. His eyes were blue and bright and gleamed as he spoke.



""Good morning, Elliot,"" he said, crossing the room and settling onto the bed beside me. His hand reached out, warm and steady, rubbing my back like a father comforting a restless child.



I flinched away. ""Who are you?"" My voice was hoarse. ""How do you know my name?""



He chuckled a warm, pleasant sound. ""I'm your father, of course. Why wouldn’t I know your name?""



My father? No. That wasn’t right. My father worked on a ship. My father smelled of oil and salt, not like… chocolate.



""Father?"" I repeated my voice barely above a whisper. ""What is this? What’s happening? Am I dead? Are you God?""



His laughter came again, lighthearted but strangely dismissive. ""That dream really shook you up, didn’t it?"" He patted my shoulder. ""Come on, let’s get you some breakfast. Your mother’s making French toast.""



I didn’t move. ""I’m not going anywhere until you tell me what’s going on.""



The man sighed, still smiling, but there was something behind his expression now, something unreadable. ""I already told you, son. I’m your dad. Now, come eat before your food gets cold.""



My thoughts raced. Everything in me screamed that something was wrong, but my stomach betrayed me, I was starving. Hesitantly, I slid out of bed and followed him into the hall.



The cabin stretched long, lined with identical wooden doors. As we walked, we reached a staircase leading down to a grand entryway. A massive antler chandelier hung from the ceiling, casting long shadows across a red-carpeted floor. The scent of cinnamon grew stronger.



We passed through a set of double doors into a wide room that resembled a strange market stall, rows upon rows of glass vials lining a long station that sat in the center of the room. They contained liquid in shifting colors, starting deep brown on one end and transitioning into vibrant hues as they progressed toward the right. I wanted to ask what they were, but something about them made me keep silent.



We kept walking until we entered what looked like a rustic diner. Booths lined the walls, and wooden tables filled the space. The scent of warm syrup and French toast filled the air. The moment we stepped inside, the entire room fell silent.



Every person- men, women, and children, turned toward us in sync. They stared at us, their faces blank. Then they all spoke in unison.



""Good morning, Dad!""



Then, just as quickly, they turned back to their meals, carrying on as if nothing had happened. I felt my stomach twist with unease.



The man led me to an empty table and sat down across from me. A woman soon approached, carrying two plates. She looked older than him, her face deeply lined, her curly blonde hair pulled into a loose bun. She set down our breakfast of scrambled eggs, and golden French toast before pouring me a glass of orange juice.



“OJ as usual,” She said with a smile before turning to the man sitting in front of me. How’d she know orange juice was my favorite? My mind ached almost as much as my stomach. 



""Coffee, Dad?"" she asked, her voice sweet but flat.



""Black, as usual,"" the man replied, cutting into his food.



I reached for my fork, eager to eat and push aside the anxiety in my chest, but before I could take a bite, his hand shot out, stopping me.



""Ah, ah, ah. Not yet, Elliot."" His fingers curled firmly around my wrist. ""You haven’t said good morning to Dad yet.""



His voice light, his grip firm. Too firm. His blue eyes locked onto mine.



I hesitated, my stomach twisting with hunger and discomfort. 



I swallowed hard. ""...Good morning, Dad.""



His grip loosened. He beamed. ""Atta boy."" He went back to his food. ""That’s what Dad likes to see. Obedient children are good children.""



I clenched my fork, forcing myself to eat despite my sudden loss of appetite. After a few bites, I couldn’t help but speak.



""You’re not my father.""



The man’s smile didn’t waver, but he stopped chewing. He tilted his head slightly. ""What was that?""



I swallowed. ""You’re not my father."" This time, I said it louder. ""My father works on a ship. He’s a mechanic. He’s the kindest man you’ll ever meet.""



The man sighed, shaking his head. ""I don’t know what you’re talking about, Elliot."" His voice was still gentle, but it carried a cold undertone. ""You must still be confused. You seem to be having trouble knowing what’s real… and what’s just a dream.""



The fork in my hand trembled. My pulse pounded in my ears. I didn’t know where I was. I didn’t know who these people were, and I wasn’t sure if I had ever known them at all.



I ate in silence, forcing each bite past the lump in my throat. The food was good, perfect, even, but there was something off about it. Every flavor was heightened, exaggerated, like a memory of breakfast rather than the real thing. The man across from me, Dad, ate without another word, his demeanor, unbothered, as if my outburst had never happened. The woman, Mom, moved around the dining hall, tending to others with the same soft expression. The people at the tables spoke in quiet murmurs, laughter occasionally popping through the room.



I kept my head down. I didn’t want to meet anyone's eyes. Then, from the corner of my vision, I saw them.



Two children sat in a booth near the far wall, watching me. A thin, dark-skinned girl with braided hair and hollow cheeks, and beside her, a pale, bald boy with soft features and large, glassy eyes. They were younger than me, maybe ten or eleven, but something about them felt old. When they saw my eyes meet theirs they quickly looked away going back to their food,  shoveling it into their mouths. I looked away quickly.



The moment breakfast ended, Dad clapped his hands together. ""Alright, kiddo, let’s get you back to bed. You’ve had a rough morning. Why don’t you head to your room and rest a bit longer? I’ll have Mom check on you once we’re done cleaning up from breakfast.""



He got up, gathered our plates, and carried them to the kitchen, leaving me sitting there alone.



I didn’t know what to do. Should I try to run to the front door and leave? What were all those vials? Should I ask someone, anyone, what was happening? My mind spiraled with questions, each one leading to another. But despite everything, a deep feeling inside made me feel like I should listen to Dad.



I got up from the table and walked through the dining hall and back into the main hallway. People greeted me as I passed saying ""Good morning, Elliot!"", but I ignored them. I just kept walking, my feet carrying me back upstairs, back to my room. The scent of pine and damp cloth lingered in the air. It felt familiar now, nostalgic.



When I reached my room, it was exactly as I had left it. The walk had felt natural- as if I’d done it a million times before.



I sat down, inhaling the familiar scent of the room, but something itched at the edge of my mind. I turned to the window and froze.



Beyond the glass stretched an endless ocean. A vast, rolling sea, glistening under a perfect blue sky. My stomach dropped. The ship. My family. My real family. My friends. How had I forgotten them? How had I let them slip away so easily?



I gripped the windowsill, my breath coming in shallow gasps. I thought about climbing through the window, running across the grass, into the sand, and down to the water. Maybe if I reached the ocean, I’d remember everything. Maybe I’d wake up. 



But I stayed. I stayed, trapped in a body that didn’t feel like my own. My mind spiraled further out of control. I crawled back into bed and wept, burying my face in the pillows, sobbing until my chest ached. Until I felt empty. A soft knock at the door startled me.



“Elliot?” A woman’s voice.



I wiped my face and swallowed the lump in my throat. ""Come in.""



The woman from the dining hall entered, Mom.



""Oh, baby, what’s the matter?"" she asked, a worried look spreading across her face as she hurried over and knelt beside my bed.



“I’m just so confused,” I choked out between sobs. “I don’t know what’s real or what’s not, or what’s happening. I don’t know you.”



I covered my face with my hands, shaking.



She wrapped her arms around me, pulling me close. Her warmth seeped into my skin, comforting me. ""Oh, sweetheart,"" she cooed, stroking my hair. ""Of course you know who I am. I’m your mom, honey.""



I clung to her, my sobs quieting as my breathing settled.



""You just had a bad dream, baby,"" she murmured, rocking me gently. ""It’s all over now. Mommy’s here.""



She held me for a long time until my trembling stopped and my mind felt lighter, as if she had smoothed over the edges of my thoughts.



“Sorry, Mom,” I mumbled, rubbing my eyes.



""It’s okay, sweetie. Dreams can be scary. But you’re here now. You’re home now, with your family.""



She smiled, rubbing my back. ""Why don’t you rest? Put on a movie.""



She stood and walked over to the TV in the corner of the room, turning it on.



""Pick something you like,"" she said. ""You can come down for lunch whenever you’re feeling up to it.""



“Lunch?” I asked looking at her confused. “But we just ate breakfast.” 



She chuckled softly, “Elliot, you’ve been up here for hours, don’t be silly.” I felt an emptiness consume me as I heard her words. Hours? I swear I’d just gotten up here.



“Get some rest now honey, you look exhausted.” She said in a warm tone as she quietly closed the door.



I pushed the worry out of my head, lifting myself up from the bed. I walked to the cabinet beneath the TV. I opened it and pulled out a box of DVDs.



Inside were all the classics: Terminator 2, Rambo, Predator, Back to the Future 1 and 3, you name it. 



My fingers hesitated over the case. How did they know? I loved old 80s movies. I grabbed The Return of Godzilla and threw it into the DVD player. Settling into my bed and watching the movie. 



As the movie started, the familiar grainy opening sequence filled the screen. The low hum of the soundtrack vibrated through the room, grounding me to something real, something mine.

I pulled the blanket over my shoulders and let the film play, but my mind drifted.



How did they know?



How did they know these were my favorites? How did they know I always skipped Back to the Future 2? 



I tried to shake the thought, trying to focus on what was happening on screen.



I saw the ocean. The submarine.

A deep unease stirred in me, something beyond the film.



The ocean. The ship.



My father. My real father.



The air in my room suddenly felt heavier, like the walls were pressing in. I gripped the blanket tighter.



Then I heard a soft creak. Not from the movie. From inside the room. Slowly, I turned my head toward the door. It was open- just a crack. Someone was standing there. Two figures small and unmoving.



The thin, girl, her expression blank stood beside the pale, bald boy from the diner earlier. They didn’t say anything. They just watched.



I shivered with discomfort.



I spoke softly, “Can I help you?”



The girl tilted her head slightly. The boy blinked, his face unreadable. Then, in perfect unison, they turned and walked away, disappearing into the dimly lit hallway.

I sat up, my heartbeat hammering in my chest. I should stay in my room. I should. But something inside me refused.



 I threw off the blanket and climbed out of bed, stepping carefully toward the door. The hallway was quiet, the scent of old wood stronger than before. The warm glow from the wall lights flickered slightly, like a candle in a draft.

I peeked out, looking down the hall. The two children were just ahead, turning a corner.

Without thinking, I followed. I stepped into the hallway, my bare feet sinking into the plush carpet. The air was still, the only sound was the faint noise from the TV behind me, muffled as I pulled the door shut.



I quickened my pace, careful to keep quiet. As I rounded the bend, I caught sight of them at the far end of the hall. They stood in front of a door. It looked like any other room in the cabin however simply looking at it, staring down that hall made my skin crawl. The girl pressed her small hand against the knob but didn’t turn it. The boy just stood there, staring at the wood as if he could see through it. I stopped, keeping my distance. 



“Why are you watching me? What’s in there?” I asked anxiously. 



They didn’t react right away. Then, the girl turned her head just enough to glance at me over her shoulder. Her eyes, deep and dark, didn’t hold any malice, just curiosity.



“You don’t remember?” she asked.



Her voice was quiet and unsettling.



The boy finally turned to face me. “You shouldn’t be here,” he said dryly.



“I live here,” I muttered, though the words felt wrong in my mouth.



The girl gave a small smile. “Do you?”



I didn’t know how to respond.



The boy took a step forward. “Go back to your room, Elliot.”



It wasn’t a threat, but it wasn’t a request either. I wanted to listen. I should listen, but my eyes flickered back to the door. Something inside me screamed that I needed to know what was behind it.



I swallowed hard. “What’s in there?” I asked again.



The girl turned fully now, watching me carefully. “You already asked that.”



I hesitated, stepping closer. “And you didn’t answer.”



The boy frowned, glancing at me before looking at the girl. “He’s not ready.”



My fingers twitched at my sides. Before I could say anything else, the girl reached for the knob and turned it.



“Elliot.”



A voice cut through the silence.



I spun around.



Dad stood at the other end of the hallway, his expression calm but defiant. “Get away from there.”



I hesitated. The girl and boy didn’t move, didn’t even look at him.



Dad took a step closer, his smile tight. “Now, son.”



I looked back at the door.



“Elliot get over here now!” Dad spoke in a loud voice

The command hit me like a slap, and for a moment, I froze. His words echoed in my head. The door seemed to pulse, calling me back, begging me to step closer. But Dad’s voice cut through the invisible force pulling me there.



I turned fully to face him. His eyes bore into mine, and the smile on his face had shifted, no longer kind but instead cold and tense. The urge to move toward the door battled with the fear that crept up my spine.



I steadied myself. ""What’s behind that door?"" I asked, my voice shaking slightly, out of frustration and fear.



Dad’s jaw clenched. “Don’t ask about things you don’t understand, Elliot.”



He took another step forward, his presence filling the narrow hallway like a wall. The hall seemed to tighten just slightly. It was suffocating, but I couldn’t escape the door, something was hidden behind it.



The girl’s voice broke the silence, soft, as if she was speaking to herself. “You’ll forget,” she said quietly. “You’ll forget everything.”



The boy spoke, his tone flat. “You’re not ready to remember.”



I felt my chest tighten. “What do you mean, not ready?” My words slipping out before I could stop them.



Dad stepped forward again, stretching out his hand trying to reassure me, but only made me feel smaller. ""Come with me, Elliot,"" he said, his voice softer now but still insistent. ""Let’s get you back to your room.”



I glanced at the door one last time. There was something there I couldn’t name. I could almost feel it in my bones, like a whisper just beyond the reach of my understanding.



With a final glance at the children, whose expressions hadn't changed at all, I turned toward Dad and moved back down the hall. The air felt different now, less suffocating but still hanging with tension. 



As we reached the top of the stairs, Dad placed a hand on my shoulder. ""You don't need to know everything right now,"" he said, his voice low. “Everything will make sense when the time is right.”



I nodded, but inside, my mind raced, questions swirling around the edges of my thoughts. What was it that I wasn’t ready to understand? What was up with those two? What was behind that door?



“Who are they, Dad?” I asked, following him back to my room.



“Anthozoa and Erinaceus?” he asked, sounding a little surprised I didn’t know. “Your brother and sister, of course. Those two are always getting into trouble.” He shook his head with a smile. “I’ll see to it they get a stern talking to.”



I didn’t say anything else as I followed him down the hall. Something didn’t sit right about the way he spoke about them. Brother and sister? They didn’t look anything like me, not even close. But Dad’s words reverberated in my mind, and I let it go, trying to push the confusion to the back of my thoughts. They’re family.



The next days, weeks, or months passed. I couldn’t tell how long time went on. Time seemed to stretch endlessly, slipping through my fingers like sand. The mornings blurred together, one breakfast after another, the same routine, the same faces. At some point, I stopped counting the days. I woke up, ate, watched TV or read. I didn’t leave my room much. No one really came to check on me anymore. Mom, Dad, and the other adults were busy with... something. I wasn’t sure what. I would spend some of my time with my siblings, spending time in the glass-breaking room, where we would destroy vials, flasks, and other small glass items with hammers and similar tools. We’d also play video games, build puzzles, and other activities. 



I tried to remember bits and pieces of my past, faces, places, and fragments of my life before. But the harder I tried, the foggier it became. Why did I feel like there was something I was supposed to know? My old life felt so far away, like a dream that was slipping through my consciousness, out of reach. I didn’t have an old life. This was my old life. 



I’d occasionally see Anthozoa and Erinaceus. Each time it happened it would cause my stomach to sink. I never spent time with them as they would always put me in an unease. They would always be playing or talking together, their odd smiles never quite leaving their faces. They were always together, never apart. Maybe it’s normal, I thought, siblings stick together. But something about their presence felt off, like they were always waiting for something to happen, something they were a part of that I couldn’t understand.



I never went back to the room, the one that made me feel so uncomfortable. Dad knew best. If I wasn’t meant to go in there then I wouldn’t. 



My biggest peeve in my day to day was going to the bathroom. The room was located on the first floor and down the hall in the opposite direction of the diner. The bathroom appeared like any other bathroom you’d find in a lodge, however, the exterior wall was entirely glass. You could see that the lodge sat on a peninsula as the ocean stretched out from all sides. The peninsula arched off into the distance out of view, beautiful lush, and green surrounded by sandy beaches and crystal blue sea. It never rained, it never stormed.



 Storm… the sea, I hated the sea. I couldn’t stand to look out the window. It made me ache. 



There were more lodges across the green. I would see figures moving outside them sometimes. I never went outside. It’s not that I couldn’t, my siblings went swimming often, but I was just ok with staying inside. Leaving, oh god just the thought made me want to shrink up and cry. 



One afternoon, after years that felt like days of routine, Dad finally approached me.



“Elliot, we’ve got something new for you to learn,” he said, his voice calm, but there was an edge to it now. “It’s time for you to start learning how we make the vials.”



I had seen the vials before- rows and rows of them, lined up in the strange market booth-like area. But I hadn’t given them much thought until now. Curiosity stirred within me.



I followed Dad down the same hallway I had walked through so many times, but this time, I was hyper-aware of every step, every creak of the floor beneath us. We entered the central room beyond the lobby where the vials lay.



The room was dimly lit, the air filled with the scent of something unfamiliar. In the center of the room stood the station, covered with vials lined up neatly in rows. Some were empty, others half-filled with different colored liquids that seemed to shimmer in the low light.



“This is where it all happens,” Dad said, his voice low and reverent. He motioned for me to come closer. “You’ll learn to make them yourself. The vials are important, Elliot. You’ll understand why soon enough.”



I stood there, my mind swirling with confusion and curiosity, but mostly with a deep, unsettling feeling. Something was off about all of this. Something was wrong.



Dad handed me a small vial, its contents a murky brown liquid. “This, my son, is what you don’t want.” He opened it, taking a swig. “Delicious, but useless,” he said, handing it to me. “Drink, don’t be afraid.”



I held the vial in my hands, my fingers trembling. The brown liquid was thick and flaky. I touched my lips to the edge of the vial and poured the contents into my mouth. It tasted sweet, like melted chocolate mixed with the greatest piece of fruit you’d ever bitten into.



“That is good,” I said, smiling. He smiled back. “Why don’t we drink these more often?” I asked, grabbing another one from the shelf.



“Because, my child, that would be a waste.” He motioned to the gradient of vials, pointing at the brightly colored bottles. “The liquid can be turned back into what we need, what we use. Let me show you.”



He took the brown liquid from my hands and opened a cabinet beneath the station, revealing rows of small flasks. “Pick one,” he said, motioning to the array.



I knelt down and looked at the containers, each one labeled with a different animal. I grabbed one labeled “duck.”



“Good choice,” he said as I stood. “Now pour that into the vial I’m holding,” he instructed.



I opened the flask, and as I did so, the sound of a quack whispered from the bottle. I jumped slightly, and Dad let out a chuckle.



“Don’t be afraid. Now, pour.”



I poured the flask into the vial. Pink smoke flowed into the flask, swirling with the brown liquid. As it touched the substance, it slowly began to change, turning into a bright pink, clear fluid, similar to the smoke. Once all the liquid was pink, I closed the flask back up and put it away.



“Look at that,” Dad said with a smile. “You actually did it,” He said shaking his head. He swirled the vial around a bit and placed it back on the shelf. “I wasn’t worried one bit. I knew you were ready. I can always tell.”



“Ready for what?” I asked.



“To make vials, that’s what. All you need to know is that you can do it now. You’re not ready to know everything yet, child. Just trust your father.”



He patted me on the back as we walked out. 



“I’m so proud of you, Elliot. You’re making the whole family proud.” He ruffled my hair a bit, “Now, I’ve got to get back to work, sport.” He spoke as he walked away from the room, leaving me standing there.



 I turned away from the room and walked toward the lobby, the soft sound of my footsteps echoing loudly in the silence. Dad’s words still lingered in my ears: Trust your father. He’d said it so many times before. Yet, this time, it felt different. This time, I wasn’t so sure.



As I passed through the grand entryway, I caught a glimpse of Anthozoa and Erinaceus. They stood in the shadow of the stairwell, watching me. Their faces were expressionless, but there was something in the way they looked at me that made my stomach tighten. I tried to ignore them, but they didn’t break eye contact. It unnerved me. As we kept staring I suddenly felt my mind break. I grabbed my head as I felt it begin to ache. A sharp, stabbing pain pulsed through my skull, spreading like wildfire. My hands shook as I dug my nails into my scalp, trying to steady myself.



I felt cold, my skin prickling as if I were submerged in icy water. My heart raced, and the world around me began to warp. The walls of the hallway dissolved into mist, and suddenly, I was no longer in the house. The sharp scent of saltwater filled my nostrils. I looked around, and the hall was gone- replaced by the blinding flashes of lightning and the relentless crash of waves.



I was on a ship. The sound was overwhelming. The wind howled like an animal, pushing against me with force. The rain pelted me like bullets, stinging my skin, the cold water soaking me to the bone. My clothes clung to me, heavy with the weight of the storm. The ship creaked and groaned beneath me, the deck slick with water as I staggered to my feet, struggling to stay upright.



I felt my heart pounding, the adrenaline coursing through my veins. I couldn’t make sense of any of it. I was in the middle of a storm, a storm that felt real. My legs gave out beneath me, and I collapsed to the deck, gasping for air, clutching at the wet wood as though it could anchor me to something solid.



The cold water covered my body, my chest tightening as I gasped for breath, my heart racing in panic. The sound of the storm consumed me, a deafening roar in my ears. I crumpled on the ground, shivering, unable to understand why I was there or what was happening. I wanted to scream, to call out for help, but my voice was lost in the chaos.



Then, as if the storm itself had swallowed me whole, everything vanished. In the blink of an eye, I was back. My chest heaved, my breath ragged as I lay on the cold floor of the hallway. The world felt distorted as if I had just woken from a nightmare, but the lingering sensation of the storm still clung to me. I blinked, trying to steady myself.



I looked up. Anthozoa and Erinaceus stood over me, their eyes cold and unblinking. The hallway was still and, unchanged, but the air felt heavier, charged with something I couldn’t explain.



My head throbbed. The pain was dull now, but the disorienting feeling lingered. My hand trembled as I reached up to touch my face expecting to feel rainwater, but there was nothing.



“Follow us quickly, Elliot!” Anthozoa’s voice urgently broke through the haze in my mind.



I stared at her, unable to move for a moment. My mind felt fragmented as if parts of it were still lost somewhere in the storm I had just experienced. My hand hung in the air, trembling, the wetness on my skin no longer there, leaving only the sting of cold on my fingertips.

Erinaceus didn't say anything. He just stood there, his gaze steady and unwavering, as if waiting for something.



“Now, Elliot!” Anthozoa’s voice snapped, more forceful this time, pulling me from my paralysis.



I stumbled to my feet, my legs shaky, my head still reeling from the vision. It felt like something was slipping from me, like I was losing hold of myself, losing pieces of who I was. I wanted to question them, ask them what was happening, but the words caught in my throat. I was too afraid to speak, too afraid of what they might say or what might happen if I didn’t do as they said. 



I followed them. Anthozoa and Erinaceus didn’t speak, their feet gliding effortlessly across the floor. I could barely make out the soft scrape of their feet against the carpet as we climbed the central stairs, the steps creaked as we ascended. I glanced behind me, unsure if I had the courage to go further, but the pressure of their presence pushed me forward. We reached the landing at the top of the stairs, and as I followed them, we turned sharply to the left. My breath caught in my throat as I saw the door at the end of the hallway, my memory flickered, and I realized this was the same room from before, the one that had felt so wrong when I had come to it earlier.



The air was cold, and the walls pulsed with a quiet, hidden menace. The door loomed ahead, and my feet felt heavy. Anthozoa and Erinaceus didn’t wait for me to gather my thoughts. They simply opened the door, and with a gentle push, I was ushered inside.



The room was a vast and endless hallway that stretched far beyond my sight in either direction. The walls were lined with old arcade machines, each one glowing with a strange, unnatural light that cast long, shifting shadows across the space. 



“What is this place?” I asked, my voice trembling as I looked back at the two children. Their cold eyes were locked on me, unblinking, unfeeling.



“Remember, Elliot,” they spoke in unison, their voices a strange blend of desperation and command. The words seemed to vibrate in the air, hanging like a weight.



“Remember!” they repeated, louder this time. The urgency in their voices sent a shiver down my spine. It felt as if something important was slipping away from me, something that I couldn’t grasp no matter how hard I tried.



“You must remember, Elliot,” they said together.



“Play,” Erinaceus spoke, his finger pointing toward the nearest machine. I felt a deep, gnawing fear coil in my gut. I wanted to run, to turn and flee, but my body wouldn’t obey. It felt as though the room itself was pulling me toward the machines.



“I don’t want to, please, can we leave?” My voice cracked as I pleaded, my heart pounding in my chest, my hands shaking at my sides. I could feel the cold sweat trickling down my back.



“You must play, Elliot,” Erinaceus repeated, his voice even colder this time.



“We are running out of time,” Anthozoa spoke, She pointed toward the machine again, and her gaze bore into me urging me, begging me, demanding me. “Play.”



I felt trapped. There was no way out. Slowly, I turned, walking toward the machine, each step dragging me closer to something I couldn’t comprehend. As I neared it, the screen flickered and the words “Hello, Elliot!” appeared across the display in bold, cheerful letters.



My heart raced in my chest as I stared at the screen. The image changed. It was a beach, beautiful and serene, the sand stretching out in all directions, the waves gently lapping at the shore. A message flashed across the screen: “Start.”



I sat there, my body trembling. I didn’t want to do this, but I felt a force, something unseen but undeniable, pushing me forward. The screen seemed to pull me in, beckoning me to click the start button.



My hand shook as I reached for it and with a shaky breath, I pressed the button. The world around me seemed to blur, the room fading into the distance as the game swallowed me whole. 

I found myself on a beach. The sky was dark, no moon or stars hung above, casting everything in an inky blackness. The ocean lapped at the shore quietly and calmly, as though even the ocean understood it was night. Standing on the shore, I saw three figures, small children. They stood there in the darkness, motionless, staring at me.



I walked toward them slowly at first, my body moving with hesitation. Soon, an inexplicable urgency took over. My pace quickened, and I found myself running, sprinting toward them, my heart pounding in my chest. The beach seemed to stretch infinitely as I ran, the shore pulling away from me with each step.

My feet began to ache, and my legs grew heavier, but I couldn’t stop. I kept running, the sound of my feet pounding into the sand echoing in my ears. The beach, endless and unyielding, continued to stretch out before me. I felt my breath quicken, and soon tears welled up in my eyes. The wind picked up, howling through the night, and though the sky remained clear, I could hear the distant rumblings of a storm. The waves crashed harder against the shore, and thunder boomed from some unseen place.



I heard the sound of metal creaking, the ocean’s water twisting into machines I couldn’t see. My heart raced as I cried out, “Come back!” My voice broke, “I can’t lose you, please!” The words hung in the air, distorted by the unnatural noise surrounding me.



Then, I heard it. A voice. It was faint at first, barely a whisper, but it grew louder. “Elliot!” The voice echoed in my ears, sharp and desperate.



“Elliot!” The voice was screaming now.



I turned around, my heart skipping a beat. There, standing at the edge of the beach where the sand met the grass, was Dad. The glow of the cabin behind him bathed him in soft light, casting long shadows across the ground.



“Come back here right now, son!” His voice was filled with a strange intensity. “You should not be out here so late.”



I froze the weight of his words pressing against me. The figures on the beach and the storm had gone, only Dad’s voice remained, cutting through the chaos. He was real. He was here.



""I’ve had enough of this foolishness, boy. Obedient children are good children."" With that, he snapped his fingers, and suddenly, I was back in the lobby of the cabin. Dad stood next to me, wearing a long cloak that covered his face with a hood.



In front of me, the inhabitants of the cabin stood in a massive circle around the outer edges of the lobby. Hundreds of cloaked figures, their robes hiding their faces, surrounded the room. The two staircases and the hall above were filled with people, turning the main entrance into an arena.



“Come, child, it is time,” he spoke, his voice firm, leading me through the crowd of hooded figures. The heavy silence surrounded me as I walked, feeling their eyes on me, though I couldn’t see their faces.



As I broke through the crowd, I finally saw what they encircled. In the center, lying on the red carpet, was Anthozoa. She lay crumpled on the floor, her face pale, sickly, her body trembling.

Why is it so many shitty dog owners, I'm truly curious? I'm also a hater as you might notice further down, but some owners is just so annoying without any self conscious, probably not the right wording, but hope you get it. 

Just 30 minutes ago a dog (dachshund) ran after us (me and my GSD) when I walked, the guy had a bigger garden than my apartment and a terrace, he came running and barking but not closer than 5 meters. After 20 meters I had to stop since it kept following, when the owner came out (he was inside) he just said quietly ""oh no, stop that, don't do that"" and then he secured his terrace so the dog couldn't run outside...

A few weeks ago at 6am, we took an early walk and another guy 10 minutes away let his dog out to the street (in a leash at least), but he has a huge garden that is closed with a fence, so his dog just stood outside his door barking while my dog sat down by command until the owner got control of his dog (also inside, probably drinking coffee), just why, you have a fenced garden.

A year ago where I lived before some dog came running after us from their terrace, the lady of that house had complained about my GSD before and that I was to young to own that breed (she was a puppy and under training, still is tho, but far better now, again I try not tot to be a POS). But when their dog ran after us in the street, where cars drive, she didn't run out to pull their dog inside/back, just yelled quietly from their terrace ""come here, come back"" and I had to ask if she would get her dog. After that when we met it was just awkward.

Another one (insert dj Khaled meme), we was on a walk and met another dog on a leash with their whole family, wife and kids in a stroller. We both started at my right side, I went to the left side against the road, they all switched side... I went back to right side and they follow, then again back to left side, before we met he asked if they could greet each other and I said no, he didn't care and let his flexi line loose so I kneed his dog in the head and my dog bit my knee. If I asked to touch his wife and he said no, I wouldn't touch his wife. No means no, there was a reason I wouldn't let them greet each other, I know my dog, don't care if his dog is ""nice"" when mine isn't (and I work on it).

I have so many stories, back where I lived before we had a horse breeder as a neighbor, with two dogs. One of the dogs was always on a leash, the other was never on a leash, who do you think behaved? Correct, the one without a leash was a menace, he came running to our garden 300 meters away regularly. His defense in the beginning was that his dog needed company, but that isn't my job, that's his as an owner. When we met them walking, the owner couldn't get any contact with the dog. First I threatened to put his dog on a leash in my yard and put on a timer before he missed his dog and came looking. He got angry and said I had to deliver it back or call him, but he didn't call me when his dog came running. It didn't help, so then I threatened to let my dog roam free around his horses and probably run into their space, he got furious and said he would call the cops (ironically). At some point I said the next time I see that dog alone I will call the cops and tow company (here we don't have any sort of animal police etc, tow company collects dogs), I have pictures months back. Suddenly it stopped, he probably didn't want to pay around 750 dollars to claim his dog. 

My ex used to say they don't care about other animals. But they do own an animal, so why is it so hard to not be an asshole? Just take the precautions you can and you are already better than 30% of the other owners (probably a high percentage, but it feels like that).

Also when I tried to post this to r/dogs I got a warning that this topic might require legal advice and dog/animal abuse, why is that? I could not post ot there, Is it because of ""threatened"" or ""kneed"" another dog? (Dont believe anyone here can actually answer it, but it's weird for me).

Probably some spelling mistakes, I'm sorry ",5,1742864195.0,PetPeeves,4,1.0,False
