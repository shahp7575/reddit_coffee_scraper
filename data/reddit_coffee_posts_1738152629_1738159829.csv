It’s the simple, time-tested habits our ancestors thrived with.

Save these **DO’s and DON’Ts** for optimal health:

# ❌ DON’Ts: What to Avoid

**🚫 Don’t Wear Polyester**  
👙 Your skin absorbs what it touches. Polyester traps sweat and releases harmful microplastics. Swap it for breathable, natural fabrics like cotton, linen, or wool.

**🚫 Don’t Drink Tap Water**  
🚰 Tap water often contains chlorine, heavy metals, and contaminants. Use a quality water filter or drink mineral-rich spring water straight from nature.

**🚫 Don’t Go Vegan**  
🌿 A plant-based diet might work short term, but over time it leads to deficiencies. Your body thrives on bioavailable nutrients from animal products like eggs, milk, and red meat.

**🚫 Don’t Avoid the Sun**  
🌞 Sunlight is essential for boosting mood, immunity, and vitamin D production. Build exposure gradually, skip toxic sunscreens, and let your body benefit.

**🚫 Don’t Grab Coffee Right After Waking Up**  
☕️ Drinking coffee immediately spikes cortisol, leading to energy crashes. Instead, start your day with water, movement, and natural light before reaching for caffeine.

# ✅ DO’s: What to Focus On

**✔️ Do Add More Animal Fats**  
🥚 Eggs, raw milk, and grass-fed red meat are packed with healthy fats, protein, and essential nutrients for brain health, hormone balance, and sustainable energy.

**✔️ Do Avoid Seed Oils**  
🛢️ Industrial seed oils are highly processed and inflammatory. Replace them with traditional fats like olive oil, tallow, or grass-fed butter.

**✔️ Do Avoid Light at Night**  
📱 Reduce blue light exposure by putting your phone away at least an hour before bed. This helps your mind relax and improves sleep quality.

**✔️ Do Walk Barefoot Outside**  
🌿 Grounding connects your body to the earth, calming your nervous system and reducing inflammation. Make it a daily habit.

**✔️ Do Eat More Raw Foods**  
🥗 Raw, nutrient-dense foods like meats, fruits, and raw dairy provide essential enzymes, vitamins, and minerals in their purest form.

**Modern habits are costing us our health.**

Make these shifts and start living the way your body was designed to. 🌿🔥

Carnivore is Destroying My Gut & I Don’t Know What to Do Anymore

Hey r/keto, I really need some insight because every time I try carnivore, I suffer. I don’t mean mild “keto flu” stuff—I mean serious, intense pain that leaves me feeling like something is seriously wrong.

For context, I’ve done very strict carnivore multiple times, and each time, something extreme happens to my body:
	1.	First time: Ended up in the hospital because of intense stomach pain.
	2.	Second time: Had some milk, and my body nearly shut down—felt like I was about to pass out.
	3.	Now this time: Intense upper stomach pain that’s throbbing, twisting, and won’t go away.

What’s Happening Right Now
	•	I’m currently 42 hours into a fast (about to extend it for 12 more hours with just water & tea to see if it helps).
	•	The pain started as light menstrual-like cramps, but then it moved UP into my upper stomach and became throbbing, twisting pain.
	•	It feels like a rock is sitting in my stomach and won’t move.
	•	There’s rumbling/vibration inside, but no sharp stabbing pains, just constant throbbing pressure.
	•	It feels worse when I drink coffee or artificial sweeteners, but I need sweeteners to push through my fasts.

What I Suspect Might Be Happening

I’ve been considering a few possibilities:
	1.	Artificial Sweeteners Destroying My Gut?
	•	I usually tolerate a lot of artificial sweeteners, but I’ve noticed that on carnivore, my gut gets way more sensitive.
	•	I recently had psyllium husk (fiber) with artificial sweeteners + added even more sweeteners on top.
	•	My gut might be fermenting everything weirdly because it’s not used to processing non-meat stuff anymore.
	2.	Gastritis or Acid Issues?
	•	The pain feels deep in my upper stomach, almost like my stomach lining is irritated.
	•	Coffee on an empty stomach might have worsened things.
	•	Sweeteners like sucralose & aspartame are known to mess with gut bacteria and the stomach lining.
	3.	Bile Flow / Gallbladder Issue?
	•	Carnivore is high-fat, and if my gallbladder isn’t releasing bile properly, my digestion might be struggling.
	•	The pain doesn’t feel sharp or gallstone-like, but I know bile stagnation can cause digestive backup.
	4.	Intestinal Gas / Blockage?
	•	The pain moves around slightly, which makes me think maybe I just have a bad case of gas or slow motility.
	•	But I’ve done carnivore before, and I never had this level of discomfort just from gas.

My Plan Right Now

✅ Extend my fast for 12 more hours—only plain tea and water (no sweeteners, no coffee, no psyllium husk).
✅ Try deep breathing & belly massage to see if it helps move anything.
✅ Cut out artificial sweeteners for the next few days and see if things improve.
✅ Reintroduce some light foods after fasting (maybe plain yogurt + eggs) instead of jumping straight into heavy meat.

🚨 BUT if the pain gets worse, sharper, or I start vomiting, I’ll get medical help.

Why the Hell Does This Happen to Me Every Time I Do Carnivore?

I’m just sick and tired of every time I try carnivore, something extreme happens. I see people on here thriving, and I want to lose weight & stay low-carb, but my body is making it so damn hard.
	•	I’ve done strict carnivore before, so I KNOW it’s not just an “adaptation” thing.
	•	Every time I try, my gut rebels in an extreme way that doesn’t happen when I eat junk food, sugar, or even high-carb diets.
	•	It’s not just “keto flu” or “electrolytes.” It’s real digestive distress, and I don’t know what to do anymore.

👉 Has anyone else dealt with this? Did you fix it? Should I switch back to keto and slowly transition instead of diving into strict carnivore again? At this point, I’d rather just be able to function than keep going through this hell.

Any help would be appreciated. I don’t want to quit, but I can’t keep suffering like this.",0,1738159352.0,keto,3,0.5,False

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

It’s the simple, time-tested habits our ancestors thrived with—habits that not only improve physical health but are crucial for **men’s mental health, confidence, and resilience.**

Save these **DO’s and DON’Ts** to build a stronger mind and body:

# ❌ DON’Ts: What to Avoid

**🚫 Don’t Wear Polyester**  
👙 Your skin absorbs what it touches. Polyester traps sweat and releases harmful microplastics, which can disrupt hormones and affect mental clarity. Swap it for breathable, natural fabrics like cotton, linen, or wool to improve comfort, skin health, and overall well-being.

**🚫 Don’t Drink Tap Water**  
🚰 Tap water contains chlorine, heavy metals, and contaminants that can interfere with hormones and brain function. Staying hydrated with mineral-rich spring water or filtered water supports better focus, energy levels, and cognitive performance.

**🚫 Don’t Go Vegan**  
🌿 A plant-based diet may work short term, but over time it leads to deficiencies in key nutrients like B12, iron, and omega-3s—nutrients essential for testosterone production, brain function, and emotional stability. Animal-based foods support strong mental resilience and optimal hormone balance.

**🚫 Don’t Avoid the Sun**  
🌞 Sunlight increases serotonin and dopamine levels—key neurotransmitters for motivation, confidence, and mental clarity. Daily sun exposure improves mood, reduces stress, and enhances sleep quality, which is essential for a strong mind.

**🚫 Don’t Grab Coffee Right After Waking Up**  
☕️ Drinking coffee immediately spikes cortisol, leading to stress, anxiety, and energy crashes. Instead, starting the day with water, movement, and natural light stabilizes hormones and sets up a clear, focused mindset for the day.

# ✅ DO’s: What to Focus On

**✔️ Do Add More Animal Fats**  
🥚 Healthy fats from animal sources like eggs, raw milk, and grass-fed red meat provide cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins needed for testosterone production, mental clarity, and steady energy levels—key for confidence, drive, and focus.

**✔️ Do Avoid Seed Oils**  
🛢️ Seed oils are highly inflammatory and linked to brain fog, mood swings, and hormonal imbalances. Swapping them for traditional fats like tallow, grass-fed butter, and olive oil helps stabilize mood and supports long-term brain health.

**✔️ Do Avoid Light at Night**  
📱 Blue light at night messes with melatonin production, leading to poor sleep, low testosterone, and decreased mental sharpness. Turning off screens at least an hour before bed improves recovery, emotional stability, and overall mental resilience.

**✔️ Do Walk Barefoot Outside**  
🌿 Grounding reduces stress and inflammation while promoting relaxation. Connecting with the earth naturally lowers cortisol, calms the nervous system, and brings a sense of clarity and focus.

**✔️ Do Eat More Raw Foods**  
🥗 Raw, nutrient-dense foods like meats, fruits, and raw dairy provide essential nutrients for brain function, mood stability, and optimal energy. Proper nutrition is one of the most underrated keys to mental well-being and sharp decision-making.

# A Strong Body = A Strong Mind

Modern habits are weakening men mentally and physically. By prioritizing real food, better sleep, natural light, and avoiding harmful substances, you set yourself up for peak mental clarity, confidence, and resilience.

I drink coffee everyday from a Senseo and want to upgrade as I really enjoy drinking it but I miss milk drinks like a cappucino and would really love to be able to use good beans from a local roaster. I also **enjoy exploring new drinks**. Most of the stuff I buy is high tech (newest of technologies) and I would like to see this also in a superautomatic: (big) touchscreen, WiFi for updates (and maybe remote control) and **as much automated as possible**. Preferably the machine would **make milk drinks without me needing to do something manually**. **Long term maintenance shouldn't cost me a fortune**, I work in tech and can repair it myself if needed/possible. I would also like to use it to make hot chocolate drinks by **using hot milk and melting chocolate** in the glass/mug. **5 years durability without repairs** (aside from the normal cleaning/maintenance by myself) is a must. And at last, **Cold Brewing is a big plus** as I like drinking cold brews when on the road.

Now, I purchased a Saeco Xelsis Suprema (SM8889) for €1000 (via my employer) but unfortunately it's out of stock until presumably March (+ Philips is denying me the current local cashback of €200 because ""I didn't purchase the machine yet""). I read a lot of good things about it but also some bad stuff like it being too loud and complex milk system. I would set **my budget at around €1800** but can be a bit more if it's really worth it and I am based in Belgium (EU). I have been doubting to cancel my order to buy something else, but don't know what to do... 

I have been looking at other machines, but don't know what's best for my case:

* Saeco Xelsis Suprema
   * Cheap at €1000 but have been denied cashback due to no stock and this is really setting me up
   * Doubting the durability of it
   * Really love the big touchscreen and the many recipes/drinks
   * 2 years warranty
* Siemens EQ900 Dual Bean
   * TQ907R03 with dual bean would cost me around €1750 after local cashback (due 31st of January)
   * 4 years warranty after registering 
   * Durability issues and software issues?
* Siemens EQ900 Plus
   * TQ903RZ3 with ""autoCalc'n Clean"" system for about €1900 after local cashback (due 31st of January)
   * Can't find anything about these auto cleaning cartridges aside them costing €100 at least every 9 months, crazy expensive but super easy?
   * Also 4 years warranty after registering 
* Jura Z10
   * Almost purchased but was really put off by it not even including a milk jug and the expensive cleaning accessories...
   * At least €2000 without needed accessories
   * Mold issues?
   * Only 2 years warranty for a machine that presumably would last 10 years explained by local dealer, is Jura not confident in their own products?
   * ""Can only be maintained and repaired by an authorised dealer if purchased there"" the local dealer told me > costs €200 more and really hate stuff like that
   * I read the touch interface is a pain in the \*\*\* to use, no swiping for example 
* KitcheAid KF8
   * €2000
   * Don't know much about it but other Reddit Users are enjoying it?

Everyone in town knew the stories—warnings whispered around campfires and scrawled onto faded signs at the edge of the forest. Don’t wander after dark. Stay away from the deep trails. Beware from the Skinwalker.

I’d always thought it was bullshit. Folklore to keep kids out of trouble or scare away tourists.  

But that night, something pulled me in.  

I don’t remember why I went. Maybe I needed to clear my head, or maybe I just wanted to prove to myself that I wasn’t scared. I followed the trail deeper than I ever had before, the air growing colder, the trees twisting into shapes that looked almost human.  

Then I heard it.  

A voice—soft and familiar—calling my name.  

“Ethan...”  

I froze. It was my mother’s voice, but it couldn’t have been. She’d been dead for five years.  

“Ethan... come here.”  

I turned slowly, my heart pounding, and saw something in the shadows. A figure, tall and gaunt, its skin stretched too tightly over its bones. Its face was wrong—almost human but not quite, its eyes glinting like a predator’s in the moonlight.  

And it was smiling.  

I ran.  

I didn’t sleep that night.  

The memory of the figure haunted me—its voice, its smile, the way it seemed to know me. I locked my doors, shut my windows, and told myself it was just my imagination.  

But the next morning, I noticed the first change.  

The sunlight hurt. Not in the usual way—not like squinting after waking up too early. This was deeper, sharper, like needles stabbing into my eyes.  

By the time I got to work, my senses were dialed up to eleven. The hum of the fluorescent lights was deafening. I could hear my coworkers’ conversations from across the room, smell the stale coffee in the breakroom from my desk.  

And then there was the hunger.  

It wasn’t like I was starving—it was something else, something deeper. A craving I couldn’t place.  

At lunch, I sat with Sarah, my closest friend. She was laughing about something, but I wasn’t paying attention. All I could focus on was the way her pulse beat in her neck, the faint smell of sweat and soap on her skin.  

I had to excuse myself before I did something I couldn’t explain.  

By the end of the week, I couldn’t deny that something was happening to me.  

I could run faster than I ever had before, my legs carrying me through the woods at an inhuman speed. My senses were sharper than ever, every sound, every scent, every flicker of movement painting a vivid picture of the world around me.  

And I loved it.  

I wasn’t scared anymore. The fear that had gripped me after that night in the woods was gone, replaced by something new: exhilaration. Power.  

For the first time in my life, I felt alive.  

I started testing my abilities in small ways—lifting heavy objects, sneaking up on people without making a sound. Once, I mimicked Sarah’s voice perfectly, watching her spin around in confusion when she heard her name.  

It was addictive.  

I didn’t care that I was changing. I didn’t care that my reflection in the mirror seemed... off, my eyes darker, my teeth sharper.  

I wanted more.  

The cravings became impossible to ignore.  
Normal food didn’t satisfy me anymore. No matter how much I ate, the hunger gnawed at me, a constant, insistent pull that wouldn’t let me rest.  

One night, I found myself wandering the streets, drawn by the scent of something warm and alive.  

I didn’t mean to hurt the stray dog. I didn’t even know what I was doing until it was over—until I was crouched over its still body, my hands slick with blood, my teeth aching.  

But I didn’t feel guilt.  

I felt satisfied.  

The changes weren’t just physical anymore.  

I stopped going to work, stopped answering Sarah’s texts. The idea of being around people made my skin crawl. They smelled too good, too tempting, and I wasn’t sure I could control myself anymore.  

The voice started a week later.  

At first, I thought it was my own thoughts. But it didn’t take long to realize it wasn’t me.  

It whispered in the back of my mind, soft and insistent. Take what you need. They won’t stop you. You’re not like them anymore. 

And it was right. I wasn’t.  

One night, I caught my reflection in the window and barely recognized myself.  

My skin was stretched tight over my bones, my eyes glowing faintly in the dark. My teeth had grown sharper, my fingers longer, tipped with claws.  

But what struck me most was my smile.  

It wasn’t mine.  

It was the creature’s.  

I should’ve been horrified, but I wasn’t. The fear was long gone, replaced by something darker. I liked what I was becoming.  

And I wanted to see how far I could go.  

I didn’t choose Sarah because I hated her.  

I chose her because she trusted me. 

She invited me over, worried about how distant I’d been. She tried to talk to me, to pull me out of whatever she thought was wrong.  

I let her think she could save me.  

It was almost too easy. Her voice, her mannerisms, her scent—I absorbed them all, wearing them like a second skin.  

By the time I left her house, I wasn’t just Ethan anymore.  

I was Sarah.  

I spent the next few weeks wearing her face, her voice, her life. Her coworkers didn’t notice the difference. Her family didn’t suspect a thing.  

I felt invincible.  

But the voice wasn’t satisfied.  

It whispered to me constantly now, urging me to take more, to lose myself completely.  

“You don’t need to pretend,” it said. “You’re not human anymore. You’re better than them.” 

And it was right. I didn’t need to pretend. I didn’t need to hold onto my old life.  

I could be anyone. Anything.  

I stood in front of the mirror, staring at the thing I’d become.  

The hunger was all-consuming now, my body barely human, my mind teetering on the edge of something dark and infinite.  

The voice urged me to let go, to embrace the transformation completely.  

But deep down, a small part of me hesitated.  

I thought about Sarah, about the way she’d looked at me before I took her face. I thought about who I used to be, the life I’d had before the woods.  

Did I want to hold onto that? Or was it better to let it all burn? 

Next day, I visited The woods and it's welcomed me like an old friend.  

The towering trees, the shifting shadows, the distant rustle of unseen creatures—all of it felt alive in a way it never had before. I moved through the underbrush silently, my new body attuned to every sound, every scent.  

It didn’t take long to find my first prey.  

A group of campers sat around a fire, their laughter echoing through the forest. I watched them from the shadows, my glowing eyes reflecting the flickering flames.  

They smelled incredible. The salt of their sweat, the tang of their fear, the faint sweetness of their skin. Made My mouth watered.  

But I didn’t rush in. I waited, crouched in the dark, savoring the moment.  

When I finally stepped into the light, their screams were music to my ears.  

I didn’t just kill them. I became them.  

Their voices, their faces, their memories—all of it was mine now. When I left the campsite, I wore the face of a young man named David. His life, his mannerisms, his laugh—it all felt like second nature, as though I’d been David my whole life.  

But the hunger didn’t stop.  

It never stopped.  

Every time I fed, it grew louder, more insistent. The voice inside me whispered constantly now, urging me to take more, to lose myself completely.  

“You’re not one of them anymore,” it said. “You’re a predator. Embrace it.”  

And I did.  

I walked into towns and cities wearing stolen faces, blending in perfectly. No one suspected a thing. I was everyone and no one, a ghost moving through the world.  

But the more I fed, the less I recognized myself.  

One night, I caught my reflection in a car window and froze.  

It wasn’t David’s face staring back at me, or Sarah’s, or anyone else’s. It was something monstrous—a patchwork of features, shifting and blending in impossible ways. My eyes glowed faintly, my teeth too sharp, my smile stretched too wide.  

I stepped back, my chest tightening.  

“Who am I?” I whispered.  

The voice laughed, low and cruel. “You’re whatever you want to be.”  

But that wasn’t true. Not anymore.  

The faces I wore, the lives I stole—they weren’t choices. They were masks, and the thing beneath them was hollow.  

For the first time, the hunger didn’t feel exhilarating.  

It felt empty.  

The turning point came when I returned to my hometown.  

I didn’t plan to. I hadn’t even thought about it. But something inside me pulled me back, guiding me through the familiar streets, the familiar sights.  

And there, standing in the front yard of my old house, was my younger brother, Eric.  

He didn’t see me at first. He was laughing with his friends, tossing a football back and forth, completely unaware of the thing lurking in the shadows.  

I should’ve left.  

But I didn’t.  

I stepped forward, the hunger roaring in my chest. Eric turned, his smile fading as he saw me.  

“Ethan?” he said, his voice soft, uncertain.  

Hearing my name hurt more than I expected.  

Eric approached slowly, his brow furrowed. “Is it really you?” he asked.  

I nodded, my throat tightening.  

He stared at me for a long moment, his eyes searching mine. “You look... different,” he said finally. “What happened to you?”  

The hunger screamed at me to take him, to absorb his life, his memories, his warmth. But for the first time, I hesitated.  

Eric was the last thread connecting me to who I used to be. He was the only person who still thought of me as human.  

And I realized I didn’t want to lose that.  

“I’m sorry,” I whispered, my voice breaking.  

“For what?” he asked, confused.  

I didn’t answer. Instead, I turned and ran, the shadows swallowing me whole.  

The voice was furious.  

“You’re weak,” it hissed. “He was yours. You could’ve taken him. You should’ve taken him.”

But I didn’t listen. Not anymore.  

For weeks, I wandered aimlessly, the hunger gnawing at me, the voice screaming in my head. My body was falling apart, shifting uncontrollably, my reflection barely recognizable.  

I was losing myself.  

And then I realized what I had to do.  

The answer was in the woods, where it had all begun.  

I returned to the spot where I’d first seen the creature, the place where my transformation had started. The air was thick with the scent of decay, the trees looming like silent witnesses.  

There, in the clearing, I found it.  

The creature.  

It was waiting for me, its gaunt form motionless, its glowing eyes watching as I stepped forward.  

“You knew this would happen,” I said, my voice steady.  

It tilted its head, a grotesque smile spreading across its face.  

“You wanted me to become like you,” I continued. “But I’m not. Not yet.”  

The creature’s smile widened, its voice low and guttural. “Then finish it,” it said. “Take the final step. Become what you were meant to be.”  

I reached into my pocket and pulled out the hunting knife I’d brought with me.  

The creature’s eyes gleamed with anticipation as I stepped closer, the blade glinting in the moonlight.  

But I didn’t use it on the creature.  

I used it on myself.  

Hit into my arm, deep and deliberate, and black, viscous blood oozed from the wound. The creature’s smile faltered as I let the blood drip onto the ground, forming a circle around us.  

“What are you doing?” it growled, its voice tinged with fear.  

“I’m ending this,” I said, my voice steady.  

The blood circle flared to life, the ground trembling beneath our feet. The creature shrieked, its form writhing as the circle tightened, pulling it inward.  

“You can’t stop it!” it screamed. “You’ll always be one of us!”  

I stared at it, my body trembling. “Maybe,” I said. “But not today.”  

The circle collapsed, dragging the creature into the earth. The air grew silent, the shadows retreating.  

And for the first time, the hunger was gone. 

I don’t know what I am anymore.  

I’m not human, not completely. My reflection is still wrong, my senses still too sharp. But the hunger is gone, and the voice is silent.  

I live alone now, far from anyone I could hurt. The woods are my home, a constant reminder of what I almost became.  

Sometimes, I think about Eric and myself, about the life I left behind. I wonder if he remembers me, if he still hopes I’ll come back.  

But I can’t go back. Not yet.  

Because no matter how much I’ve fought it, no matter how much I’ve resisted...  

I know the creature was right.  

I’ll always be one of them.

It’s the simple, time-tested habits our ancestors thrived with.

Save these **DO’s and DON’Ts** for optimal health:

# ❌ DON’Ts: What to Avoid

**🚫 Don’t Wear Polyester**  
👙 Your skin absorbs what it touches. Polyester traps sweat and releases harmful microplastics. Swap it for breathable, natural fabrics like cotton, linen, or wool.

**🚫 Don’t Drink Tap Water**  
🚰 Tap water often contains chlorine, heavy metals, and contaminants. Use a quality water filter or drink mineral-rich spring water straight from nature.

**🚫 Don’t Go Vegan**  
🌿 A plant-based diet might work short term, but over time it leads to deficiencies. Your body thrives on bioavailable nutrients from animal products like eggs, milk, and red meat.

**🚫 Don’t Avoid the Sun**  
🌞 Sunlight is essential for boosting mood, immunity, and vitamin D production. Build exposure gradually, skip toxic sunscreens, and let your body benefit.

**🚫 Don’t Grab Coffee Right After Waking Up**  
☕️ Drinking coffee immediately spikes cortisol, leading to energy crashes. Instead, start your day with water, movement, and natural light before reaching for caffeine.

# ✅ DO’s: What to Focus On

**✔️ Do Add More Animal Fats**  
🥚 Eggs, raw milk, and grass-fed red meat are packed with healthy fats, protein, and essential nutrients for brain health, hormone balance, and sustainable energy.

**✔️ Do Avoid Seed Oils**  
🛢️ Industrial seed oils are highly processed and inflammatory. Replace them with traditional fats like olive oil, tallow, or grass-fed butter.

**✔️ Do Avoid Light at Night**  
📱 Reduce blue light exposure by putting your phone away at least an hour before bed. This helps your mind relax and improves sleep quality.

**✔️ Do Walk Barefoot Outside**  
🌿 Grounding connects your body to the earth, calming your nervous system and reducing inflammation. Make it a daily habit.

**✔️ Do Eat More Raw Foods**  
🥗 Raw, nutrient-dense foods like meats, fruits, and raw dairy provide essential enzymes, vitamins, and minerals in their purest form.

**Modern habits are costing us our health.**

Make these shifts and start living the way your body was designed to. 🌿🔥

I am a so-called disabled pensioner with the world's lowest pension for 20 years this year!! I saved and scraped by for 1.5 years to buy something I never owned - a Bible! I finally got enough money for the study Bible, the big one with 20 thousand notes. I carried it with me almost everywhere in a protective case and in my backpack. So after the fourth service it came with me (I was going to a friend's right afterwards and that's why it was in my backpack) I went to the toilet and after that I drank church coffee with many other visitors. At one point I turn around and ""hiccup"" when I see how the backpack is, that's not how I put it. So I get up and go there and almost burst into tears when I lift up an empty backpack, both my new nice Bible and my iPhone that I got from my son who then drove himself to death shortly afterwards were gone without a trace. I don't have a computer or such a tablet, so my phone was my contact with the outside world. In addition, I have multiple diseases so I panic when I think about the phone. Luckily, I have been able to borrow a phone for a couple of weeks. So I clasp my hands in prayer and if someone or some people here can find in their heart a desire to help me at this time, no one will be more grateful and happy than I will be. 

send a DM and I will reply with an address or a swish number that will be usable. I just have to see if I can activate or what is needed. Then finally, I want to apologize so terribly for sounding like a beggar, if I could have solved this misery in another way, I would have done so. my income is too low to get a loan. 

Alex

  


Jag är så kallad sjukpensionär med världens lägsta pension sedan 20 år i år!!  Jag sparade och gnetade i 1,5 år för att köpa något jag aldrig ägt - en Bibel! Jag fick till slut ihop till studiebibeln, den stora med 20 tusen noter. Jag bar med den nästan överallt i ett skyddande fodral och ner i ryggsäcken.  Så efter den fjärde gudstjänsten den följde med på (Jag skulle till en vän direkt efteråt och därav var den med i ryggan) gick jag på wc och efter det drack jag kyrkkaffe med många andra besökare. Vid ett tillfälle vänder jag mig om och ”hickar till” när jag ser hur ryggsäcken ligger, det var inte så jag la den. Så jag reser mig och går dit och brister nästan ut i gråt när jag lyfter upp en tom ryggsäck, både min nya fina bibel och min iPhone som jag fick av min son som sedan körde ihjäl sig strax efteråt var spårlöst borta. Jag har ingen dator eller sån surfplatta, så min telefon var min kontakt med omvärlden. Dessutom är jag multisjuk så jag får panik när jag tänker på telefonen. Som tur är så har jag fått låna en telefon ett par veckor. Så jag knäpper mina händer i bön och om någon eller några här kan finna i sitt hjärta en vilja att hjälpa mig i denna stund, så är ingen mer tacksam och glad än vad jag kommer att vara.  
skicka ett DM så svarar jag med adress eller ett swish-nummer som ska gå att använda. Jag måste bara se om jag kan aktivera eller vad som behövs. Sen till slut så vill jag be så hemskt mycket om ursäkt för att jag låter som en tiggare, hade jag kunnat lösa detta elände på annat sätt så hade jag gjort det.  
jag har för låg inkomst för att få ett lån.

Since the shutdown last year, I kinda missed (at some point) sending photos because I started enjoying the thrill in taking them haha. This is not an invitation for an exchange. I just wanna let this out because no one in my friends know that Ive sent nude photos haha.

Thats where also I met up with people and had coffee together. I dont use dating apps so the meetup was purely wholesome and it's mostly just to pass time. I even met up with someone who adopted some of our kittens haha.

1ictwpc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ictwpc,Speaker placement in awkward room,"Looking for advice on speaker placement. Mostly for the side surrounds, but any advice is helpful.

My living room is very small and awkward but I’m trying to make it work. The current placement doesn’t sound terrible… but I know it could be better. Ideally I’d like to get the side surrounds on the walls or at least on actual stands/mounts but they’d have to go up high… would that sound ok?

I’m also considering rearranging and pushing the couch against the back wall to get a bit more space in the room for a coffee table or something. Obviously this would take the space my rear surrounds are in, but I could repurpose them as Atmos height channels… I’m a little nervous to ditch 7.1 though as it sounds incredible for gaming… nothing like throwing the axe in God of war and hearing it swirl around your head… but admittedly I never hear much from the rear surrounds during movies and TV.

I’m also interested in any suggestions for acoustic treatments. When the bass hits deep I’m hearing some rattles from that track for the large vertical blind.

Receiver is a Denon x3400-h and I’ve done the full calibration. Also before anyone says it… I had a second sub, it sounded great, it broke, replacing it is not in the budget right now.",8,1738157822.0,hometheater,8,1.0,False

Mali. Mas mahirap maging stockholder, homeowner, supplier, empleyado, o lupang naagaw sa Villar empire. Kasi dito, kahit saan ka lumingon, may paraan para kang malugi.

I used to buy stocks related to Villar but never again.

I've talked to friends, colleagues, bankers, vendors, and employees of Villar-owned companies, and haven't heard a single positive thing about them.

Walang Bayad ang Suppliers

May kakilala akong nag-supply sa AllDay at Coffee Project. Akala niya magandang negosyo. Akala niya malaking kumpanya, maayos magbayad. Limang taon na, hindi pa rin bayad. Kahit demand letter, wala silang pake. Parang libre nilang ginagamit ang produkto mo habang ikaw, bahala kang masira ang negosyo mo.

Walang Tubig ang Homeowners

Kung nasa isang Villar subdivision ka at hawak kayo ng Primewater, hindi mo na kailangang mag-abala magbukas ng gripo. Wala namang lalabas.

May tubig? Wala. May bill? Laging meron. May reklamo? Wag ka nang umasa.

Kung may dumating mang tubig, mabilisan, tapos ubos agad. Pero ang singil? Tuloy-tuloy, minsan abot ng libo kahit hindi mo nagamit. Lahat ng kapitbahay nagsisisi na bumili sakanila (lalo na mga OFWs).

Walang Kwenta ang Stocks

Villar IPO playbook:

Hype sa media Pump ang presyo Iwan ang retail investors na bagsak ang hawak

Kung naipit ka sa AllDay, VistaREIT, Vistamalls, o Medilines IPO, alam mo na ang sakit ng bumagsak na stock. Akala mo blue-chip, yun pala basura stock. Habang ikaw, nag-aabang bumalik ang presyo, sila - nakalabas na at panalo na.

Walang Refund, Walang Turnover

May tropa akong bumili ng Vista Residences condo sa Mindanao. Delayed nang ilang taon, walang refund.

Sa Cavite naman, may forced turnover-walang tubig, walang kuryente, WALANG SUSI. Parang pre-order ng bahay, pero scam. Hindi mo alam kung actual unit mo yung tinurn-over sayo o placeholder lang habang patuloy silang nagbenta.

Walang Respeto sa Homeowners

Bumili ka ng bahay sa isang Villar subdivision. Tapos isang araw, nagising ka na lang, ginawang highway extension ang bahay mo. Walang abiso, walang konsultasyon basta giba!

Kung gusto mong magreklamo, good luck. Binayaran mo na, bahala ka na sa buhay mo.

Walang Kwentang Employer

Sabi ng isang dating empleyado sa Villar Group:

Minamadali ang lahat ng proyekto, pero sahod laging late. Toxic work environment, trap sa office politics. Shortcuts sa construction materials, pero premium pricing sa market.

Kaya pala kada buwan, may hiring. Pero yung sahod? Wala pa rin.

Walang Takot sa Land Grabbing

May ilang farmers at landowners na biglang nawalan ng lupa dahil naging parte na ito ng bagong Villar project. Ang dating palayan, naging subdivision. Paano nangyari? Hindi mo na rin malalaman. Ang sigurado, wala ka nang laban.

Kung stockholder ka, homeowner, supplier, empleyado, o may lupa na nawala - lahat ng anggulo, may paraan silang gatasan ka.

Kung OFW ka at iniisip mong mag-invest sa Villar IPOs, preferred shares, REITs, condo, o subdivision - isipin mong mabuti. Kasi kung may paraan para maisahan ka, sigurado, covered na nila yan.

Isa na rin ako sa mga nalugi dahil sa Villar-owned company. This serves as a warning.

Feel free to share your experiences.

Update: Uunahan ko na yung magsasabi na ""Eh kumita naman ako sa HVN!"" - Oo, maraming nakasabay doon, pero tanong: Dahil ba maganda talaga ang negosyo o dahil lang sa hype? Ginamit lang ang HVN para i-pump ang ibang Villar stocks, pero kita mo naman ang sumunod - bagsak lahat. Kung nakalabas ka sa HVN na may kita, good for you. Pero kung iniisip mong mauulit yun sa ibang Villar IPOs, baka ikaw naman ang maiwan sa taas sa susunod.",8,1738157666.0,FuckVillar,2,1.0,False

This very important study combines genomics, biochemistry, structural biology and ancestral sequence reconstruction to address the basis of caffeine biosynthesis in Yerba mate, a species that is phylogenetically unrelated to other plants, namely coffee and tea, in which this pathway has been studied before. The manuscript reports the first draft genome sequence for yerba mate and provides convincing evidence for the identity and characteristics of enzymes for caffeine biosynthesis. The authors are able to propose structural constraints for the convergent evolution of individual reactions. The work will be of interest to plant and evolutionary biologists and anyone studying natural product biosynthesis.

Carnivore is Destroying My Gut & I Don’t Know What to Do Anymore

Hey r/fasting, I really need some insight because every time I try carnivore, I suffer. I don’t mean mild “keto flu” stuff—I mean serious, intense pain that leaves me feeling like something is seriously wrong.

For context, I’ve done very strict carnivore multiple times, and each time, something extreme happens to my body:
	1.	First time: Ended up in the hospital because of intense stomach pain.
	2.	Second time: Had some milk, and my body nearly shut down—felt like I was about to pass out.
	3.	Now this time: Intense upper stomach pain that’s throbbing, twisting, and won’t go away.

What’s Happening Right Now
	•	I’m currently 42 hours into a fast (about to extend it for 12 more hours with just water & tea to see if it helps).
	•	The pain started as light menstrual-like cramps, but then it moved UP into my upper stomach and became throbbing, twisting pain.
	•	It feels like a rock is sitting in my stomach and won’t move.
	•	There’s rumbling/vibration inside, but no sharp stabbing pains, just constant throbbing pressure.
	•	It feels worse when I drink coffee or artificial sweeteners, but I need sweeteners to push through my fasts.

What I Suspect Might Be Happening

I’ve been considering a few possibilities:
	1.	Artificial Sweeteners Destroying My Gut?
	•	I usually tolerate a lot of artificial sweeteners, but I’ve noticed that on carnivore, my gut gets way more sensitive.
	•	I recently had psyllium husk (fiber) with artificial sweeteners + added even more sweeteners on top.
	•	My gut might be fermenting everything weirdly because it’s not used to processing non-meat stuff anymore.
	2.	Gastritis or Acid Issues?
	•	The pain feels deep in my upper stomach, almost like my stomach lining is irritated.
	•	Coffee on an empty stomach might have worsened things.
	•	Sweeteners like sucralose & aspartame are known to mess with gut bacteria and the stomach lining.
	3.	Bile Flow / Gallbladder Issue?
	•	Carnivore is high-fat, and if my gallbladder isn’t releasing bile properly, my digestion might be struggling.
	•	The pain doesn’t feel sharp or gallstone-like, but I know bile stagnation can cause digestive backup.
	4.	Intestinal Gas / Blockage?
	•	The pain moves around slightly, which makes me think maybe I just have a bad case of gas or slow motility.
	•	But I’ve done carnivore before, and I never had this level of discomfort just from gas.

My Plan Right Now

✅ Extend my fast for 12 more hours—only plain tea and water (no sweeteners, no coffee, no psyllium husk).
✅ Try deep breathing & belly massage to see if it helps move anything.
✅ Cut out artificial sweeteners for the next few days and see if things improve.
✅ Reintroduce some light foods after fasting (maybe plain yogurt + eggs) instead of jumping straight into heavy meat.

🚨 BUT if the pain gets worse, sharper, or I start vomiting, I’ll get medical help.

Why the Hell Does This Happen to Me Every Time I Do Carnivore?

I’m just sick and tired of every time I try carnivore, something extreme happens. I see people on here thriving, and I want to lose weight & stay low-carb, but my body is making it so damn hard.
	•	I’ve done strict carnivore before, so I KNOW it’s not just an “adaptation” thing.
	•	Every time I try, my gut rebels in an extreme way that doesn’t happen when I eat junk food, sugar, or even high-carb diets.
	•	It’s not just “keto flu” or “electrolytes.” It’s real digestive distress, and I don’t know what to do anymore.

👉 Has anyone else dealt with this? Did you fix it? Should I switch back to keto and slowly transition instead of diving into strict carnivore again? At this point, I’d rather just be able to function than keep going through this hell.

Any help would be appreciated. I don’t want to quit, but I can’t keep suffering like this.",0,1738157233.0,fasting,15,0.25,False

That's why I wanted to create this comprehensive guide, listing some of the best gifts you can give a man, so you don't have to search any further.

# Tech and Gaming

[Amazfit T-Rex 3 Rugged/Military Smart Watch](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB0DCZ9PRCP) 

I can’t begin to describe how much having a smart watch has improved my life. From tracking health data to steps and managing notifications, they do it all. This one’s a great option for more active/hands-on people like me

[TREBLAB Z7 Pro - Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones](https://new-releases.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB08V1VKMLS)

I consider a good pair of noise cancelling headphones to be tech essential and I refuse to travel without them. You can go super high-end with Airpod Max or the Sony wh-1000xm5 but this one’s a great budget option

[SteelSeries Apex Pro Mini Wireless HyperMagnetic Gaming Keyboard](https://recommends.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB0B16JFF54)

One of the best gaming keyboards on the market. It’s pricey but genuinely one of the best things you can gift to a gamer.

[SteelSeries Aerox 5 - Holey RGB Gaming Mouse](https://trending.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB09VNTCZZN)

one of the best things you can gift to a gamer - mouse version

[SteelSeries Podcasting/Streaming Kit](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B0CBNVCCPJ)

So I’m assuming you’re aware that most guys dream about having a podcasting or streaming setup. I’m not ashamed to admit that I am. Something like this would be the best gift ever for guys like me. 

# Tools and other handy stuff

[Hoto Tire Inflator](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB0CQ1RCJV7)

If your bf is a car guy and doesn’t already own one of these, you NEED to get him this. It’s one of the car essentials and a really thoughtful gift that shows you care about his interests. 



[Master Mechanic Toolset](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B0D1CT5TMH)

This has basically every single driver and socket that you’d need for any sort of car or general household repairs



[Battery Tender Charger](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B016S7NHWQ)

Another must-have for car guys. Perfect as a gift because most guys don’t have something like this but would really appreciate if they got one



# Fashion and Accessories

[Bruno Marc Men's Insulated Waterproof Snow Boots](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB0CCDGW3T4)

I decided against adding more wearables since style is so subjective but these boots make the list because they’re classy and functional so you can’t go wrong with them

[Viking Revolution Beard Grooming Kit for Men](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB07K6WDR2Z)

I can’t think of a better gift for men with beards. This kit has just about everything they’d need.

[SEVEN POTIONS Beard Grooming Kit](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB072C59QQG)

Another beard kit that’s just as good**.** Fewer items but a different scent so you have options. 

[WOLFpak 45L Backpack](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B0CN4LPJSR)

Okay so everyone needs a backpack and this is one of the cooler looking ones in the market while being super functional too

# Health and Fitness

[Total Gym APEX G5 Home Gym with Compact Design](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB084Z28JNQ)

Expensive but would genuinely be the greatest gift for a guy who’s into fitness. There are times when we just can’t make it to the gym and having a way to get a workout in from the comfort of our homes is a luxury we all would appreciate 

[Lifepro Adjustable Dumbbells](https://new-releases.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB08J2L498P)

The next best thing to get for a full-body workout at home

[Nutricost Casein Protein Powder](https://trending.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB07SH19M1S)

The easiest gift to get for a gym rat. Most of us already have a whey protein powder but will always appreciate casein as a gift for night-time shakes. 

[Nutricost Creatine Powder](https://recommended.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B06WVKGGJB)

Creatine is arguably even more important than protein supplements so every gym guy needs this. You can even do both creatine and protein for a really nice gift bundle 

[Micro Ingredients Electrolyte Powder](https://best.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB0CG7TB55T)

Now this is not as important as the other supplements I’ve listed but if your bf does a lot of cardio this is a really nice way of showing that you care about their hydration

[Zyllion Shiatsu Neck and Back Massager](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB0CHH86BN9)

Recovery is just as important as the workout itself. Sadly most people don’t invest into things that improve recovery. This gadget is a great way to massage sore muscles or even just relax after a long day at work



# Sleep and Rest

[Uttermara Weighted Blanket](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB0B9GYM4D7)

I added this category and this product here because most men do not invest into products that improve their sleep quality. A weighted blanket is like a gentle hug all night long and one of the best ways to improve your sleep. 

[Honeydew Side Sleeping Pillow](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB07TVQ6CXG)

It’s a pricey pillow but it’s worth every single penny. I don’t even know why side sleepers bother with regular pillows when something like this exists. 

[Z-hom Memory Foam Mattress](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B0CGCPKPCV)

A good mattress does wonders for your sleep quality. I’ve found memory foam options like this one to be the most comfortable. 



# Home office

[SIHOO Doro C300 Ergonomic Office Chair	](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB0C3T865C2)

Anyone who doesn’t already own an ergonomic chair absolutely needs one. I think some of the best gifts are ones where you show how much you care about the other person’s wellbeing. This is one of those gifts. 

[SIHOO 55""×28"" Whole Piece Electric Standing Desk](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB0CY25VQ6B)

Another great option to improve spinal health + electric desk means you can switch between sitting and standing as needed  

[Everlasting Comfort Desk Pad](https://best.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB09BXWZQ33)

Once you have the desk and chair out of the way, you’ll want to get a nice desk pad to complete the setup for your bf

[Jlab HD Webcam](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB0BBPHJZH6)

I used to think Macbook webcams were impressive until I saw what this thing can do. It’s super high-quality and makes you look that much more professional in online meetings



# Food and Drink

[Mueller French Press Coffee Maker](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB07JGBK6XV)

All coffee nerds appreciate a high quality French press. Super simple way of showing them that you care about their interests

[CASABREWS Espresso Machine](https://new-releases.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB0D7T87Z4P)

If you wanna go the extra mile for that coffee person then get them an espresso machine instead

[MUD WTR](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/MUD_WTR)

Really tasty option for people on a decaf journey

[Air fryer](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-2FB0D31SL5DV)

Hands down the best kitchen invention ever. If your guy is into cooking or meal-prep this is one of the best things you can get for them. 



# Trips and experiences 

[Travel gift card](https://trip.reddittor.top/Trip_Gift)

If you're SUPER indecisive, instead of getting just any gift card, get a travel gift card instead. This way you're not just being lazy, you're funding an adventure. It's like saying “I don't know what you want, but I know you deserve a vacation”

I am from Belarus, but I have not lived there for the last few years. I am not a traveler, but I have already moved to several countries and my journey continues. That is why I am looking for friends all over the world. I do not care where you live, what gender and age you are. Sometimes people become good friends even without a lot of common interests. Why not?

Let me tell you a little about myself. I like reading books and listening to them in audio format. Sometimes I read comics. I like watching movies, cartoons. I adore horror films! I love video games. Especially indie games in pixel graphics. I also cross-stitch and sometimes take pictures of people. I love autumn and winter. Although lately I have been living in a place where there is only summer. I love hot coffee, walking and swinging. Sometimes I swim in the pool.

I am also a bit of a bore and not very talkative, but I am always ready to listen and support a friends if them needs it.

I love meeting new people. If you are also looking for friendship, just write to me.

P.S. I really don't care where you live, but if you are from Vietnam, it means that I will meet someone who is in the same location with me.

M : 19 (him) 

I’ve posted a part of my story here before and i think i’m willing to go through with breaking up this time. I always tell myself that “ 2 years is a pretty long time to get wasted “ but i think i don’t want to see myself in this relationship in the next few more years. I want to be happy, i want to be free and don’t have any anxiety anymore. I don’t want sleepless miserable nights. And u deserve better i know that. So i am genuinely asking, how can i let go fully , please

Context of my current social and mental situation:

- i think i lost my aura ( i used to attract guys so much before , i always felt so pretty and being with him i think i lost my touch) 

- i lost all my friends ( so i used to cope break ups by just hanging out with my friends , but i lost them. He and i used to be in the same circle, but when we had one of our break ups our friends sided with him and made fun of me; so yeah i cut them off and leaned on my boyfriend most of the time. Not that i dont have family but (PS I have a wonderful rs with my family) i just dont and cant tell them with what im going through cause they will be clingy and would ask so many questions and if my older brother were to find out that he was abusive , he will beat the crap out of my soon to be ex

- i lost all my confidence ( i used to be so confident but he destroyed it so much that its at a negative rn .)

- i think i developed anxiety when i’m alone, ( solo coffee shops , solo walking at the mall , solo eating at a restaurant gives me so much anxiety that even at school i would rather eat at a toilet stall than to be seen alone because although i know nobody cares with what im doing i feel like im being pitied and judged ) so solo activities cant be an option as of now, maybe when i get my confidence back ill overcome this but as of now i really cant

so yea, i really need some opinion or options for this because i really want to let him go , let me be free and get that peace of mind and nice sleeps back .",1,1738156396.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

Couple years ago, I got them and multiple times it was like doing scorch earth passing thru my intestines. Maybe it was just that one batch. No. Multiple times. So I just didn't want to go back not even for other items. 

I thought a work around for it was to wait like 10+ minutes with the box closed to let the residual heat continue cooking it. I thought maybe the bacteria wasn't properly cooked on and in the wings. I think this worked for a few times, but it was hit or miss. Not guaranteed. So I stopped.

I saw that email. I've seen lots of things on xabout fat being healthy and needed and that ppl were not healthy bc of everything else in their diet. I've actually lost weight and feel less groggy bc fatty meats have less volume and I'm not bloated after. Lots of nutrients. Think about how bears hibernate and everything they need is in the fat. So I got the wings bc of the fat content. Anyways

Felt good eating them. Tasty. Then I can't sleep thr past few hours. Taking a diarrhea dump multiple times. Went and drank some coffee rn to hopefully push everything oit better.

One time I gave Sekhmet and Het-Heru wine mixed with two types of sweet wine and not long after, I was quickly growing sleepy an hour earlier than my usual time to feel it. Recently, I changed up my offering routine to eating after offering, asking Sekhmet to accept the offering or eat it through me. I feel like she was liking the chocolate cupcake more than the coffee with creamer because the cupcake tasted better than I initially thought (I used a baking mix) and I think the coffee cooled more than she liked and my taste receptors didn’t find it that flavorful. I think I’m getting somewhere, but wanted to know if anyone else experienced this?

Mali. Mas mahirap maging stockholder, homeowner, supplier, empleyado, o lupang naagaw sa Villar empire. Kasi dito, kahit saan ka lumingon, may paraan para kang malugi.


I used to buy stocks related to Villar but never again.


I've talked to friends, colleagues, bankers, vendors, and employees of Villar-owned companies, and haven't heard a single positive thing about them.


- Walang Bayad ang Suppliers 


May kakilala akong nag-supply sa AllDay at Coffee Project. Akala niya magandang negosyo. Akala niya malaking kumpanya, maayos magbayad. Limang taon na, hindi pa rin bayad. Kahit demand letter, wala silang pake. Parang libre nilang ginagamit ang produkto mo habang ikaw, bahala kang masira ang negosyo mo.


- Walang Tubig ang Homeowners 


Kung nasa isang Villar subdivision ka at hawak kayo ng Primewater, hindi mo na kailangang mag-abala magbukas ng gripo. Wala namang lalabas.


May tubig? Wala. May bill? Laging meron. May reklamo? Wag ka nang umasa. 


Kung may dumating mang tubig, mabilisan, tapos ubos agad. Pero ang singil? Tuloy-tuloy, minsan abot ng libo kahit hindi mo nagamit. Lahat ng kapitbahay nagsisisi na bumili sakanila (lalo na mga OFWs).


- Walang Kwenta ang Stocks 


Villar IPO playbook:


Hype sa media Pump ang presyo Iwan ang retail investors na bagsak ang hawak 


Kung naipit ka sa AllDay, VistaREIT, Vistamalls, o Medilines IPO, alam mo na ang sakit ng bumagsak na stock. Akala mo blue-chip, yun pala basura stock. Habang ikaw, nag-aabang bumalik ang presyo, sila - nakalabas na at panalo na.


- Walang Refund, Walang Turnover
 

May tropa akong bumili ng Vista Residences condo sa Mindanao. Delayed nang ilang taon, walang refund.


Sa Cavite naman, may forced turnover-walang tubig, walang kuryente, WALANG SUSI. Parang pre-order ng bahay, pero scam. Hindi mo alam kung actual unit mo yung tinurn-over sayo o placeholder lang habang patuloy silang nagbenta.


- Walang Respeto sa Homeowners 


Bumili ka ng bahay sa isang Villar subdivision. Tapos isang araw, nagising ka na lang, ginawang highway extension ang bahay mo. Walang abiso, walang konsultasyon basta giba!


Kung gusto mong magreklamo, good luck. Binayaran mo na, bahala ka na sa buhay mo.


- Walang Kwentang Employer
 

Sabi ng isang dating empleyado sa Villar Group:


Minamadali ang lahat ng proyekto, pero sahod laging late. Toxic work environment, trap sa office politics. Shortcuts sa construction materials, pero premium pricing sa market. 


Kaya pala kada buwan, may hiring. Pero yung sahod? Wala pa rin.


- Walang Takot sa Land Grabbing 


May ilang farmers at landowners na biglang nawalan ng lupa dahil naging parte na ito ng bagong Villar project. Ang dating palayan, naging subdivision. Paano nangyari? Hindi mo na rin malalaman. Ang sigurado, wala ka nang laban.

---

Kung stockholder ka, homeowner, supplier, empleyado, o may lupa na nawala - lahat ng anggulo, may paraan silang gatasan ka.


Kung OFW ka at iniisip mong mag-invest sa Villar IPOs, preferred shares, REITs, condo, o subdivision - isipin mong mabuti. Kasi kung may paraan para maisahan ka, sigurado, covered na nila yan.


Isa na rin ako sa mga nalugi dahil sa Villar-owned company. This serves as a warning.


Feel free to share your experiences.

Update: Uunahan ko na yung magsasabi na ""Eh kumita naman ako sa HVN!"" - Oo, maraming nakasabay doon, pero tanong: Dahil ba maganda talaga ang negosyo o dahil lang sa hype? Ginamit lang ang HVN para i-pump ang ibang Villar stocks, pero kita mo naman ang sumunod - bagsak lahat. Kung nakalabas ka sa HVN na may kita, good for you. Pero kung iniisip mong mauulit yun sa ibang Villar IPOs, baka ikaw naman ang maiwan sa taas sa susunod.",54,1738156198.0,phinvest,7,0.98,False

Many blends and single origin coffees are oriented towards a certain method of brewing and seem to pair well with them. Wanted to ask folks here if there are good coffees which are perfect for french press (not necessarily from BT).

\- Mental sharpness: I feel laser-focused, even during light workouts and runs ( I wouldn’t PR while fasted, and I typically break my fast before hitting heavy compound lifts).   
\- Fat loss & flexibility: It keeps me lean and lets me enjoy weekends or date nights guilt-free. A 24-hour fast gets me right back on track and I don't have to sacrifice during social events.  
\- Endurance: Running 5-6 miles fasted? No problem. It’s been great for insulin sensitivity and fat adaptation.  
  
Here’s what has helped me stick to it:  
  
\- Electrolytes & SODIUM. If you aren't feeling great on your fast, up your sodium first.   
\- Bone broth before bed or at the end of the fast helps tremendously with sleep and improves satiety as an added bonus.  
\- High-protein meals to break the fast (plain shredded chicken is my go-to, easy to make and getting 85-100 grams of protein in first makes it so much easier to hit those protein goals).  
\- Helios (Previously injectable carnitine and choline) to fuel fat metabolism.  
\- Coffee or Ultra+ twice a day (sometimes I'll add raw milk or heavy cream to my coffee—it technically breaks the fast but ramps my metabolism and I find it worth it).  
\- Creatine (5-10g in my electrolyte drink).  
  
I've seen a lot of hate on fasting lately, saying it raises cortisol and wrecks your adrenals, adds fat to the love handles etc. I think this can be avoided if you are exercising and keeping your electrolytes in check. Again, we need much more sodium than most realize! For me, fasting has been nothing but positive and something I will definitely stick with.",1,1738155519.0,Forward_Nutrition,0,1.0,False

Unfortunately, I haven't had the best time as a lot of people are looking for short-term relationships and some have wasted my time. I get it, it's common and happens a lot.

Anyway, I met this guy on the app,  he seemed really nice, respectful and we had good banter between us. He expressed interest in me and asked to go on a coffee date together.

For me, I felt it went well. But I guess I was wrong? It was my first date in a couple of years - I've been busying myself over the years in studying/working to be where I am at today, career wise. Hence why I've not been on dates/not put myself out there, until now XD

I'll give a little run-down of how our date went:  
I was a little late by a few mins, I was trying to make myself look good for him and he asked to see me earlier than we previously planned.  
He got there earlier than me and bought me a drink already, which was waiting on the table for me when I arrived. That was very sweet, I did thank him for it. I was very nervous and admit, may have been a little awkward, as we've not even spoken on the phone. But I thought let me put myself out there, and give this a chance.  
We had good banter once we continued the conversations - we both made conversation, and were having a laugh.  
He seemed a little nervous but I was more nervous than him lol. He held very good eye contact with me, was staring at me but didn't compliment me. Looking back, I think I was shy to compliment him but I did compliment his height, and his skills of cooking etc.  
He remembered a lot of things that we talked about over text and was bringing it up during the date, I tried doing the same too. He was bring up activities that we could do together, and how we could try other coffee drinks next time.  
Towards the end of the date, he complimented my perfume, gave me a hug and said he'd like to see me again.  
Afterwards, he texted me to see if I got home ok, was mentioning about seeing me again and how he would cook a dish for me when we meet up for our next date.  
We were talking more than before for two days. Then, on the third/fourth day, his texts limited down, and eventually he told me he doesn't see a romantic connection/ potential in this and we should stop.

Do you think I have done something wrong? I know, maybe I'm looking too into this but I feel sort of blind sided. I had so many questions as to why he felt this way but I get it - if he's not feeling it, then he's not feeling it. So I responded back ending it on a good note too, wished him well.  
I know I looked pretty that day as I had nice make up on and had my hair done.  
But do you think maybe he wasn't attracted to me and said he doesn't see any romantic potential? I'm really insecure so I'm scared about how any of my future dates will go and putting myself out there again.

He said his friend had also come over to see him, do you think maybe his friend had said something?

I know, I need to just take the L but I guess, I'm just sad and trying to make sense of this/if this was due to me.

*Don’t be so scared, Harlan. If ever you yearn the ecstasy of my company, all you ever need is ask. Otherwise, I won’t touch you.* Baphomet’s speech was paced, toneless, without emotion, and yet I felt pinpricks spring across my body.

I moved towards Harold’s daughter and draped my coat around her. “She can’t walk.” I saw the deep bruising, the bewildered fluttering of her eyelids, the places the demon had branded her flesh.

I lifted the girl, totally unsure whether she would die from a fever—with her slung over my shoulder, I could smell infection—and went from the garden, Aggie calling after me. And I could hear it all as I met the street and crossed it and reentered the ruins.

Although arduous with the squalling, quivering body of the girl, I moved as quickly as I could. “Shh,” I told her and myself, “Shh.” Perhaps I was shaking too.

I heard the protests of Aggie, first she asked for me, then there was nothing but the siren call of the betrayed, the shrieks, the howls in response to Baphomet’s tortures. There would be water again on the compound. I moved away and readjusted the girl on my shoulder before I stumbled over my own boots. We fell hard on my knees, but I kept her in my arms and muffled a cry. An old prayer whispered from my lips, and I pushed myself to my feet before going on.

There was no lying to myself of what I’d done. What I’d done too many times. It never was easier. Never. Nothing like youthful fresh flesh placates a demon. It’s a deal that I’d made before and a deal I was certain I’d make again. There were no heroes or beauty in the world. No wonderful overcoming or examinations of the indomitable human spirit.

The girl’s pained expressions dampened to mere whimpers alongside flashes of weak, flailing hysteria; her infection was bad, and I was glad for her continued pain, because it meant she was alive. Once I’d found a place, perhaps a mile out from the garden, deep in the buildings of the tall ruins, I deposited her on the sidewalk then looked over her. She looked thin, famished (soul famished), and her eyes could not hold a concentrated gaze. Only after surveying the surrounding area, I withdrew my water gourd and put it to her lips slowly, being sure as to not drown her with its contents—her eyes shut and she supped at the mouth of the dead gourd, not even having the energy to hold it with her hands. I examined her deep cuts; a few scabby places around her wounds demonstrated healing, but others looked too deep and I imagined that’s where the infection was.

My voice whispered, “These are antibiotics. Please swallow them. Even if you need to chew them, take them.” Unsure if my words had registers, I pushed the pills to her lips and her closed eyes contorted funny before I slotted the medicine past her teeth and offered her another drink of water. As expected, she chewed while drinking. I lifted her once more and walked tiredly to the safehouse me and Aggie had shared the previous night. Dead weight is easily the worst part of it. The girl’s limp body hung off my shoulder and reminded me that every step I took was an infinitely small conquest.

“Stop it,” protested the girl.

“Shh,” I said.

“I want to go home.”

“Don’t we all?”

“It’s scary out here.” Perhaps she’d momentarily gained lucidity.

“Shh. You’ll attract the scary things. Just be quiet.”

It was dark by the time we reached the building with the safehouse. I fashioned a sled from an old piece of discarded sheet wood so that I could mobilize the incapacitated girl up the many stairs to my hidden place. She’d not liked it when I’d secured her to the board with the rope and with every thump up the stairs, I half expected a creature to show, but nothing happened. I hoisted the makeshift sled by its connected rope, and it took until pitch black till we shuffled into the safehouse. With the door secured, I turned my attention to her, removed my jacket from her naked shoulders and set to cleaning her wounds with alcohol and bandaging what I thought was necessary—even through the smell of her blood, the antiseptic, and through the smoke I’d lit, I could smell the brimstone wafting off her. It was treacherous, but I gave her a spare fit of clothes I’d brought and while the threads hung off her too largely, at least she’d been given decency. With her tucked into a bedroll, I watched through the same windows I’d peered from the night prior and watched the glowing eyes of creatures that parkoured across tall structures, or fought amongst themselves, and every so often it seemed those eyes stared back at me through the dirty glass, but I hoped not. I secured the door each night but was hopeful the deal would keep them at bay.

Only a few times did the Boss’s daughter stir throughout the night, but she seemed to rest well enough as anyone could within the circumstances. There were a few times I checked the heat off her forehead and felt the temperature rising. Stripping a bit of cloth off my shirt sleeve, I dampened it and draped it across her forehead; if she’d been so unlucky as to catch a fever then she’d die for I had no measures against it.

Sleep came in short spells for me, and I burned too much lantern oil, because there was a fantasy within me where I could go back for Aggie; it was common.

It was morning then night then morning again and I was breaking what little bread I had for a tough sandwich when I heard her stir from her slumber; I watched as the young woman fumbled her hands above her prone body, touching nothing, then her eyes fluttered and she pushed herself up so as to bend into a sitting position, arms buttressing her so that she could slowly examine the room. I moved to sit near her, after placing coffee over the cooking stove. Her hand moved to her face where wounds would assuredly become scars, bad deep ones that might never heal right (demon wounds never healed right all the way) and she flinched as her fingernails poked at the lines down her cheeks.

“What’s this?” Her voice was gravelly, monotone, and dry.

“You’re awake then?” I asked.

“I think so.”

“Good. How are your limbs? Notice anything about them that are off? Can you feel everything?”

Her jaw clenched. “I don’t know if I’ll feel anything again.”

Ignoring this, I returned to the stove and pushed the heat higher. “Can you eat?”

“I’m thirsty.”

I motioned for the water gourd by her bedroll. “Can you eat? You should eat something.”

Greedily, she removed the cork and drank heavily, lines of water streaking down her chin. After removing the gourd from her mouth, a long sigh escaped her and I awaited her response, but instead, the only thing that came was a wet gurgle as she slammed the water to her lips again.

“The sooner you eat something, the stronger you’ll get. The sooner you’re strong, we’ll hit the road home. I imagine you thought you’d never miss home as much as right this second, huh?”

She cradled the gourd in her hands and smacked her lips; although her eyes were weary, a tad unfocused, she seemed self-possessed enough. “I think I’ve met you before. I think I know you.”

“Maybe,” I shrugged, “Lots of people in Golgotha have met me, but not many people know me well,” I laughed but couldn’t smile, “That sounded cheesy.”

“You work for my dad.”

I shook my head. “I do things for the Bosses sometimes. I don’t work for anyone. Never have. But sometimes a Boss needs something, I guess I’ll do it.”

“What do you do?”

“I rescued you.”

Her cold stare fell from my eyes till they drifted to the wide windows that overlooked the ruins. “I always thought it would be beautiful. Like a big, beautiful place. I thought it would be home. I thought it would be like dreams.”

My eyes followed hers where we could see the overwhelming cement-work that’d been done to create the ruins; walls were hewn to show skeletal rebar and every broken window was like a black tunnel. Each building was a tombstone. “It’s a graveyard.”

“Lady said burning incense would keep the monsters away. She told me it was the only way to keep them away.” Her voice was small with a hint of betrayal.

“Incense is good for ceremonies or preaching, but if incense was what you used to keep them away, you might as well have learned one of Lady’s incantations and done a little chicken dance.” I huffed. “If they want you and you’re there for the wanting, they’ll take you.”

She took in more water until the gourd was empty and then she held her stomach.

“Careful. If you drink too much all at once like that, you’ll end up with pains.”

She massaged her legs and removed herself from the innards of the bedroll to sit atop it. “Thank you.”

I swallowed hard and pulled the fresh coffee from the heat. “You should eat something. Do you prefer bread or canned beans—I could smack together a sandwich for you. The choices are slim at the moment, but there’s a bit of dried meat too.”

“Why don’t they take you?”

I gritted my teeth into what was hopefully a welcoming grin. “Hush. You should eat up and try to conjure whatever energy you have. I know you’ve been through it, but there’s more to come till we see home.”

“Home?”

“Indeed.”

“I came out here with Andrew. Did you find Andrew?” Her eyes momentarily illuminated with hope.

“Who’s that?”

Her eyes drifted. “He was going to be my husband. He said we’d be married.”

“He’s definitely dead.” There was no way to tell if her sweetheart was still kicking or not, but there was no use in arguing over it.

“Oh,” she whispered. There was a pause where she seemed to study the bedding she laid on. “I didn’t think it would be like this. I thought for sure that there would be something hiding out here in the wastes.”

“There’s stuff hiding alright.” I began to shrug it off but stopped myself when I could see the tears forming in her eyes. “There’s always hope, I guess.”

We took to eating nearer the large windows overlooking the large mouthy chasms and between swallows there were spits of conversation, but her attention was largely unconcentrated. At least her hunger was good, and she drank well.

I smoked while she interrogated me further on the state of the world.

“All I know is Golgotha. You’ve been around, right? Is there any good place left?” She was practically pleading the question.

“I ain’t been all over exactly. It’s not so simple. If there’s a safe place on this earth left, it won’t be long till those monsters find it and make it worse.” I watched a puff of smoke from my cigarette plume off the glass window inches from my face. “Who knows, huh? Maybe there’s a good place. Maybe there’s a place we go after life? Maybe that’s the safe place? My best advice? Don’t hope for it. Make it. Make it safe in the place you know. Do it in Golgotha and never leave those walls again. There’s nothing for you out here.”

Her voice was small in the wake of mine. “You sound bitter. I don’t know how you could say that. That’s why I left home. I thought—we thought there’s gotta’ be a good place still left. Maybe a place by the ocean.”

I shuddered at the thought. “The ocean?”

She nodded.

I shook my head. “Don’t even try it. You’ve heard the stories of what it’s like.”

“Those are just stories to scare kids.”

I sighed. “And I’m sure you thought the stories of these ruins was just to scare kids. I’m sure you thought you knew it all.” I rubbed the cigarette dead against the window. “Take a hint and stay home. We hole up like rats or we die like ‘em.”

A thought crossed her expression before she could enunciate it, “I remember your name,” said the girl, “It’s Harkin or something.”

“Harlan?”

“Yeah, that’s right! You’re Mister Harlan.”

“I guess.”

“I’ve seen you down in the town square sometimes. You like to start fights. Lady told me to stay away from you.”

“Hmph.”

“Well, never would’ve thought you were such a crank. You are quite the pessimist.”

“No, I’m an optometrist.”

“I think you mean optimist.”

“I don’t.”

“You’re very dull and angry-seeming.”

“That’s a lot of words coming from a rich girl I pulled out of a hole.”

The room was quiet before she changed the subject once more, “Well, don’t you want to know my name?”

“Sure.” The word was plain.

“I’m Gemma.”

“A pleasure.” A moment of silence. “You are aware that your father’s caused a fuss on the home-front because of your adventure?”

She shook her head.

“He shut off the water. That’s why I came to find you. He said he wouldn’t relinquish the pipes till his daughter was home. You have caused quite the problem.”

“I-I didn’t know.”

“’Course you didn’t. The haves rarely think of how their actions might affect the have-nots.”

“Well—okay, fine but there’s other places out west too! More than these ruins. More than Golgotha too. I heard from travelers and traders that there are whole other places with different ways of life. Why don’t people go there? Why should my father have more say than another?”

I nodded. “Sure, there’s a place out west where they raise sheeps, chickens, or goats; that’s where the demons stalk worse than anywhere. And even further west—northwest to be precise—there’s where the medicines and wizards hail—a city called Babylon. There’s other places, but you wouldn’t have the faintest idea of how to get there! If you did, you’d have no standing! You’d be no better than any peasant in those places. Golgotha’s where your family is. Where your station is distinguished. You’d be a fool to give it up.”

She remained quiet for only a moment, studying the lines on her palms. “Surely there’s better places than home.”

“I’ve seen some,” I shook my head, “If you’re looking for a better place, wait for death. At least the walls are tall, and the guns are big.”

We rested there at the waypoint for a handful of days; fevers began to take her sometime throughout the night. It would be smart to get her home before it got worse.

We set out just as the sun crested some unseen horizon, sending shadows long and darker; there were points when hugging the sides of pitch-black walls, that it remained night even in day within the dead city. Gemma was slow and I took note of her knees or elbows quivering due to whatever strain might be placed upon them with our traversal. I remained as calm as I could as we shifted through the morning chill, through hell, through the uncompromising screams of distant mutants or demons echoing off the walls. Every so often those howls would come, and Gemma might freeze where she was and I could see that if only for a moment, her eyes shrank, her throat swallowed, and she looked small and scared, then it would be as though she was totally unbothered, and she’d throw her shoulders back and continue following me.

“Are you winded yet?” I asked after several hours of climbing old wreckage and pushing across rubble.

“No,” her speech was gasped yet tempered, “Not yet. I’m fine.”

“Don’t be stupid.” I stopped, put up my hand and motioned for her to take a seat on a nearby stone. We sat for a moment, and I passed her the water. A few of the last drops ran the length from the corner of her mouth to her ear lobe and I winced at the loss.

“I’m ready to go again.” She moved to rise, and I put my hand on her shoulder, snatching the empty gourd from her.

“Don’t act silly now. There’s no reason with all the sun we’ve got. I hope to make it to Golgotha while there’s still light, but that does not mean I intend on dragging your corpse with me. If you need to relax, relax.”

“If there’s nothing better in this world, then what’s my corpse matter?” Gemma cut her eyes at me and stood to move away from me.

“Woe is you!” I felt anger rising. “Let’s go then, but if you fall out here, I’m done dragging your ass around.”

“Don’t.” She shrugged.

The travelling was slowed. I caught a strange glint off Gemma’s eyes when sun shafts landed across her face.

“Are you feverish still? How warm are you feeling?” The brief thought of touching her forehead graced my thoughts.

She didn’t answer and instead pushed on and so I did the same, maintaining a healthy habit of checking that she was following behind every few seconds.

Without another break, through heavy breathing and through sweat, we met the edges of the open field around Golgotha nearing early evening, and I saw the fortified walls cloaking the base of the city’s structures far out. I came to a stop while Gemma attempted to continue walking. I snatched her by the wrist, stopping her. Her head lolled around to look at me although I’m certain she didn’t really *see* me and she cut her eyes hard, yanking her hand free of mine. “Don’t touch me. I see home. It’s home. You said it’s important. We should go hide like rats.” Her jabbering came from the mouth of someone protesting through the haze of a dream.

“No. I need to signal that we’re coming. The men on the walls will see us through their scopes, but that doesn’t mean a stray bullet won’t find us.” I removed the sheet of aluminum Boss Maron had given me days prior and unfolded it until the thing was large as parchment sheet; I waved the aluminum flag overhead and began walking forward, grabbing Gemma’s hand again. She did not fight me and instead staggered along, her foot tips tracing lines in the dirt. Normally, I might’ve checked through binoculars that the men on the wall signed back, but keeping ahold of Gemma was more important in her delirious state. “We’ve still got enough sun in the sky that they’ll know its us from the reflection.”

Just as the words left my mouth, darkness overcame the landscape and I felt cold for it wasn’t night that came, but a massive shadow; I felt the wind of something immense and pulled Gemma closer to me. Looking up into the air, there was the great winged beast—a thing I’d only seen once before and never so close to a human bastion. Its several clawed fists hung in front of its chest, forelegs muscled and prepared for snatching whatever unsuspecting prey it might find; the demon’s great head was that of a serpent and the wings which arched from its back gathered wind beneath their membranes; each stroke it took overhead left a dust fog in front of us and I could scarcely make out the innumerable writhing tendrils which danced off the creature’s body. The distinguished sound of the wall’s gunfire registered across the open land, and I felt Gemma fall into me. Leviathan circled against the angry sky, casting its tremendous shadow across us. Examining Gemma, I could see her fever had overtaken her and she’d fallen unconscious. 

“I told you goddammit! I’m not going to drag your ass across this field! Wake up!” I shook the unconscious girl. Her eyelids flickered. “Wake up for Christ’s sake.” I slapped her hard and nothing and I shook her some more and pleaded. Leviathan’s scream shook the ground beneath us.

I moved across the open field as quickly as my legs would allow; with the addition of Gemma’s dead weight, I could pull on her limp arms only so long before I knelt before the shadow of the beast and hoisted her over my shoulders. I ran, top heavy, and imagined my feet leaving solid ground. Loud bangs were the signature for muzzle flashes from the wall that I could scarcely see through the sweat in my eyes.

There was no protest from Leviathan, not a care in response to the barrage of munitions.

Artillery whistled through the air and the ground shook once more while I staggered over my own weight to glance up at the beast as it took a broadside shot to its black torso and although the wound it received seemed critical, it remained unfazed while tar-colored flesh shed off the beast, plodding all around me. The warmth from the explosion kissed me like hot breath while the smell of rotted chicken filled the air and Leviathan’s blood rained over us as it adjusted itself in the sky. Dark blood ran granular and rough down my face and maybe Gemma mumbled innocuous cries—still I continued through the muck. Another artillery round struck the creature’s left wing, leaving behind a smoldering hole in its thick membrane, sending it forward into a nosedive to the ground. Its trajectory arched overhead till it slammed in an explosion of sand far to the left and the sun beamed once more. Its cries were the thousands (if not more) souls it’d devoured, screeching not like a dragon, but a village of tormented folks removed from this world and placed in another; it was the screams of strangled ghosts; the wild tentacles dotting its body writhed, snatching out at open air like whips and as thick as metal cables. The wind off the beast stung as it sent up sand in my face. Like a mistaken dog, it shook its head and propelled itself far and away into a leap that shook the ground till it glided over the horizon toward a place unseen.

I stood in the open field, certain I was dead; it was not until murmurs escaped Gemma’s mouth that I took toward Golgotha again.

The cheers of the men on the wall overtook the clacking of the main gate coming free. I fell through the doorway while some of the wall-men gathered around. The blood of Leviathan was already thickened in the sun, clinging off me with some of its meat stinking and steaming into my clothes.

“Take the girl home,” I shouldered Gemma off me onto the ground and she was caught by the men while I fell. People gathered round in knots of bewildered faces.

“Water!” some of them shouted as the spigots in town ran freely once more. Some cheered while I took tiredly in the square by the gate and sat on an arrangement of cinderblocks. Boss Maron was there, an old metal bucket banging against his left knee; he took the contents of the container and tossed it over my head. The water was warm but welcome.

“You stink.” Said the Boss.

“Why don’t you go shit somewhere else?” I was nauseous at the stench clinging to me—shaking my right hand, a hunk of the creature sloughed off my arm onto the ground.

Boss Maron took up alongside me. “Why don’t we just play nice some, eh?”

“I don’t want to hear it.”

“What’s happened to the girl you left with? You left with one girl and came back with another? What a heartbreaker you are! Certainly, a man about town!”

Depositing my pack between my knees, I removed tobacco and took to rolling a cigarette. The paper kept tearing in my hands.

“Boss Harold has a plan for those boys. Those ones that took him hostage.”

“So?”

“So, I’m just glad you came back with the girl. Others are too.”

“It’s not like *you* went without water.”

A chuckle fell from him. “’Course not. There’s no reason I should. But some of the veggies in the hydro lab looked thirsty. It’s good you returned when you did. Anyway, we knew you’d come through. I can’t remember a time you haven’t.”

I bit a poorly folded cigarette and inhaled opposite a match. My eyes traced the people cheering in the streets out near the gate then up to the wall where soldiers stood with their rifles.

“What brought the dragon out?” Boss Maron wondered aloud.

“Who gives a shit? Why don’t you go pull its tail and ask.”

Among the revelers stood a figure in a cloak with a hood covering stringy gray hair. Lady was there in a moment, watching my conversation from afar, then she was swallowed by the crowd.

Note- Coffee has been rested for 15+ days, recommendation from roasters 7 days from the roast date

Method- 16 gms of coffee 50gm of bloom water bloomed for 45s. Pour1 70 gm in 15s and a 10s pause, Pour2 60gm in 20s and a 10s pause and the last pour ie Pour3 60gm in 20s draw down time of 3:30.

Flavour notes- This coffee was one of the most irritating coffees for me to dial in but was fully worth it, since it originates from Melkodige estate its naturally sweet and is also very clean . The coffee has a very welcoming taste of an apple followed by an orange jam and finishes with a stone fruit and very slight peach. Overall I highly recommend it 9.1/10.


Comments- I have test and tried this coffee a bunch of times with both the v60 and the b75 ( Kalita 155 papers ) and to me the only slight difference I have noticed is that the coffee made with the b75 has less sweetness but more of the apple note with slight reduction. Sieving with the 400 micron screen gave me a more pleasant acidity and more of a orange note, while 500 micron gave me less of the orange note and slight increase in the apple note and a bit more cleaner lower body cup.",2,1738154707.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

I think I have pmdd (premenstrual dysphoric disorder) so before my period my anxiety goes through the roof just in general. And I think my period is due soon.

I have been preoccupied with fear and anxiety for a day and a half and I have somehow convinced myself I am infected with Noro - no matter how cool or logical I am trying to be about the whole thing (trying hard not to self-reassure though).

I was out second-hand shopping with my mother, so touching hangers and clothing all over the place, and we then went to have some coffee. I chose a cinnamon bun and ate it after spraying some HOCL spray (although it is only 80ppm concentration and not the minimum 200ppm that is needed for it to be effective) on my hands, but I didn't want to worry my mom so I wasn't as through about it as I would have liked and there was nowhere I could wash my hands.  This was yesterday and I've been preoccupied on and off thinking about how I am now definitely infected and it is just a matter of time. Cursing myself for not at least using a piece of tissue for holding my cinnamon bun. 

I'm honestly kind of ashamed of how I am dealing with this. And how I am counting down the hours to when I will be safe from ""this cinnamon bun incident"". I am forcing myself to eat regular meals, which is a partial success I would say, but mentally I am not handling it as well and as I would like. I should not even have thought about it for a second, I should just have enjoyed my cinnamon bun and then moved on with my life without a second thought.

And I don't even know what I am SO afraid of. Perhaps it is getting more into the territory of contamination OCD at this point? Because I know throwing up sucks but it will be fine. I guess there is something about the anticipation? Maybe I am somehow insane and I have something close to ""delusions""? Although I do logically understand I am not handling this very well.

I am not looking for reassurance, obviously, I just needed to vent. I am somehow fine with vomiting from something like let's say morning sickness because I would know it wasn't contagious or a sickness in that sense? I somehow need to get over this Noro-fear too but I'm not sure how to cope.

1icswyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Badboyardie/comments/1icswyu/the_daily_market_indicator/,The daily market indicator,"Earnings Season Insights  

ASML is expected to report strong Q4 earnings driven by robust demand for semiconductor equipment, despite geopolitical tensions. This has signaled positive premarket movement in the tech sector. T-Mobile US is anticipated to show subscriber growth and cost efficiencies, though analysts remain cautious about competitive pressures, leading to mixed premarket movement in telecom. Meta Platforms has not yet reported, but focus remains on its AI-driven ad revenue and metaverse investments, with analysts anticipating a positive signal for the communication services sector.  

Lucid Group (LCID) announced a new CEO, which has generated optimism about potential strategic shifts and operational improvements. This news has created a positive premarket buzz in the electric vehicle sector.  

Impact on Market Sentiment  

ASML’s earnings are likely to bolster sentiment in the semiconductor sector, which is already benefiting from supply chain diversification and global chip demand. T-Mobile’s performance could influence broader telecom sentiment depending on subscriber growth metrics. Lucid’s leadership change may drive renewed interest in EV stocks, particularly as investors look for innovation and improved execution in the space.  

Federal Reserve Interest Rate Decision  

The Federal Reserve will announce its interest rate decision today at 2 PM. The market expects rates to remain steady at 4.25%-4.50% as policymakers balance persistent inflation concerns with slowing economic growth.  

Interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate (XLRE) and utilities (XLU) may see limited relief if rates hold steady. Traders should focus on defensive stocks and short-duration bonds to navigate these conditions.  

Inflation Data Release  

Recent inflation data shows annual CPI at 2.9%, with core CPI at 3.2%, reflecting a slight deceleration but still above the Fed’s target range. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for January is expected to rise by 0.3% month-over-month, signaling potential upstream inflationary pressures that could impact manufacturing and consumer goods sectors.  

Commodities such as coffee have reached all-time highs, reflecting supply constraints and rising costs, which could further impact inflation-sensitive sectors like consumer staples (XLP). Traders should consider inflation-protected securities (TIPS) and energy stocks as hedges against these pressures.  

Geopolitical Events  

The U.S. has imposed new tariffs on chips, pharmaceuticals, and steel goods, which are expected to disrupt global trade flows and increase costs for manufacturers reliant on these imports. This development has created uncertainty in the industrials (XLI) and materials (XLB) sectors while potentially benefiting domestic producers insulated from global competition.  

The U.S. Navy’s ban on the Deep Seek app over security and ethical concerns highlights growing scrutiny of surveillance technologies, which could weigh on sentiment in the broader tech sector (XLK).  

Sector Rotation  

Technology and consumer discretionary sectors continue to outperform as investors seek growth opportunities amid slowing economic conditions. Premarket strength is evident in these areas, while financials (XLF), industrials (XLI), and regional banks (KRE) remain under pressure due to higher borrowing costs and weaker economic outlooks.  

Traders should consider rotating into sectors with strong earnings momentum like tech while avoiding rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate or utilities until there is more clarity on interest rate trends.  

S&P 500 Support and Resistance Levels
https://flic.kr/p/2qHQyRE
  

The S&P 500 is currently trading between key support at 6067 and resistance at 5970. Technical indicators suggest a bullish bias: the Money Flow Index (MFI) remains above 50, indicating strong inflow strength; the Directional Movement Index (DMI) shows +DI surpassing -DI with a high ADX above 25, confirming upward trend strength; and prices remain above the Displaced Moving Average (DMA), supporting continued bullish momentum if they stay above these levels.

Market Volatility  

The VIX index is currently at 16.41, indicating moderate volatility levels but with potential for spikes due to geopolitical risks like tariffs and today’s Fed decision. Traders should use options strategies such as straddles or collars to hedge against unexpected market swings while monitoring volatility instruments for opportunities.

Best Sector Performance  

Semiconductors present attractive opportunities for dip buys following tariff-related pullbacks, with companies like Nvidia (NVDA) offering long-term growth potential despite short-term headwinds. The banking sector remains weak, particularly regional banks like those in KRE, which have been hit by higher borrowing costs and slowing loan growth.

TL;DR Summary  

Earnings reports from ASML are boosting sentiment in semiconductors, while T-Mobile shows mixed signals ahead of its release later today. Lucid Group’s new CEO announcement has sparked optimism in EV stocks. Coffee prices have reached all-time highs amid supply constraints, adding inflationary pressures that may affect consumer staples sectors.

Geopolitical risks include new U.S. tariffs on chips, pharmaceuticals, and steel goods, which could disrupt global trade flows while benefiting domestic producers. The U.S. Navy’s ban on the Deep See app raises ethical concerns about surveillance technologies.

The Fed’s rate decision at 2 PM today will be a key driver of market sentiment, particularly for rate-sensitive sectors like real estate and utilities.

Traders should watch S&P levels at 6067 (support) and 5970 (resistance), where technical indicators suggest bullish momentum if prices remain above key moving averages.

Volatility remains moderate with the VIX at 16.41 but could spike due to geopolitical risks or unexpected Fed commentary.

Sector rotation favors technology and consumer discretionary stocks while financials and industrials lag behind due to macroeconomic pressures.

1icsw4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChartNavigators/comments/1icsw4j/the_morning_market_report/,The Morning Market Report,"Earnings Season Insights  

ASML is expected to report strong Q4 earnings driven by robust demand for semiconductor equipment, despite geopolitical tensions. This has signaled positive premarket movement in the tech sector. T-Mobile US is anticipated to show subscriber growth and cost efficiencies, though analysts remain cautious about competitive pressures, leading to mixed premarket movement in telecom. Meta Platforms has not yet reported, but focus remains on its AI-driven ad revenue and metaverse investments, with analysts anticipating a positive signal for the communication services sector.  

Lucid Group (LCID) announced a new CEO, which has generated optimism about potential strategic shifts and operational improvements. This news has created a positive premarket buzz in the electric vehicle sector.  

Impact on Market Sentiment  

ASML’s earnings are likely to bolster sentiment in the semiconductor sector, which is already benefiting from supply chain diversification and global chip demand. T-Mobile’s performance could influence broader telecom sentiment depending on subscriber growth metrics. Lucid’s leadership change may drive renewed interest in EV stocks, particularly as investors look for innovation and improved execution in the space.  

Federal Reserve Interest Rate Decision  

The Federal Reserve will announce its interest rate decision today at 2 PM. The market expects rates to remain steady at 4.25%-4.50% as policymakers balance persistent inflation concerns with slowing economic growth.  

Interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate (XLRE) and utilities (XLU) may see limited relief if rates hold steady. Traders should focus on defensive stocks and short-duration bonds to navigate these conditions.  

Inflation Data Release  

Recent inflation data shows annual CPI at 2.9%, with core CPI at 3.2%, reflecting a slight deceleration but still above the Fed’s target range. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for January is expected to rise by 0.3% month-over-month, signaling potential upstream inflationary pressures that could impact manufacturing and consumer goods sectors.  

Commodities such as coffee have reached all-time highs, reflecting supply constraints and rising costs, which could further impact inflation-sensitive sectors like consumer staples (XLP). Traders should consider inflation-protected securities (TIPS) and energy stocks as hedges against these pressures.

I was having terrible nightmares and I got myself counseling. I would have these immensely vivid dreams. So I started recording them on docs. 

I was just going over them a few days ago and found a reoccurring one that's pretty wild. I decided to have chat gpt rewrite it. 
Here it goes; 
Here's a rewritten version of your original text with a smoother narrative flow, preserving its haunting and dreamlike quality:


---

The first time, it began like this:

I was in a white, two-story house with wooden paneling and a small porch, surrounded by a vast field of yellowing grass. The house stood alone, the only thing breaking the horizon of dry, muted earth and cloudy, lifeless skies.

I woke up in a twin bed on the second floor, in a small, sparsely furnished bedroom. My pajamas were striped in white and blue. Everything felt familiar, yet distant, like I was watching myself live a life I didn’t recognize.

Descending the narrow staircase, I moved through the quiet house. I brewed a pot of coffee, the sharp, earthy aroma filling the air. My mind didn’t question the absence of anyone else—I just knew I lived alone.

With coffee in hand, I stepped out onto the porch. The dry grass swayed slightly in the breeze, and the overcast sky pressed down heavily. I lit a cigarette, inhaling as I stared out into the field, feeling a strange sense of calm despite the desolation.


---

The second time, everything unfolded the same.

The white house. The small bedroom. The striped pajamas. The coffee and cigarette on the porch. But this time, something was different.

A woman stood in the field.

She was beautiful, her figure draped in a white gown that shimmered faintly against the dull landscape. She was standing still, about 45 yards away, her gaze fixed on me. I felt her eyes, though I couldn’t make out her face clearly. I froze, cigarette burning between my fingers, unsure whether I was supposed to approach her or retreat inside.


---

The third time, the dream shifted again.

I woke up the same way, went downstairs, and the scent of brewing coffee greeted me—but I hadn’t started it. She was there, in the kitchen.

The woman from the field.

She stood by the coffee pot, pouring two cups. Neither of us spoke. She handed me one, her expression serene but unreadable. Together, we went outside and shared a cigarette on the porch. For the first time, I wasn’t alone.


---

By the fourth dream, she was waking me.

Her hand was firm on my shoulder, urgency in her touch. Still in my striped pajamas, I followed her down the stairs. There was no coffee this time, no cigarette. She led me outside and into the field, her pace hurried.

We reached a chain-link fence, rusted and gnarled. An opening stretched before us, and she didn’t hesitate. As soon as I stepped through, the world behind us disappeared.

The light of day vanished.

On the other side, we entered a dark, decaying city. The sky above was black and brown, thick and oppressive. The air smelled of rot. Buildings loomed on either side of a narrow alley, their walls cracked and crumbling. She held my hand and guided me through the desolate streets.

After a few minutes, we arrived at a set of large, glass hospital doors. Without a word, she stepped aside and vanished.

I pushed the doors open.

Inside was a bathhouse, dimly lit and oppressive. Elderly people crouched under weak streams of water in individual stalls. Their bodies were hunched and frail, their weeping echoing through the space.

And there she was again.

The woman stood among them, her white gown soaking wet, clinging to her body as she moved silently from stall to stall, washing the crying figures.

She turned to me, her face splitting into a smile. But it wasn’t warm or kind—it was monstrous. Her mouth stretched impossibly wide, her teeth sharp like razors, glinting in the dim light.

I froze, paralyzed by the grotesque grin.

That’s when I woke up.

Where Did I Go Wrong?,"Hey everyone, I wanted to keep this simple and short, but I’d really love to hear a female perspective on where I might have messed up.

This is the story of a girl I saw on my first day of college. I really wanted to approach her, and since we shared the same college bus, I finally did in December 2023. We liked each other, and in my delulu (delusional) mind, I even imagined us getting married. But a fight changed everything.

By January, I realized I didn’t want to lose someone I saw as the potential mother of my children over a silly fight. So, I planned a small surprise for her birthday—a butterfly pendant necklace and a poem (written by ChatGPT). Since exams were happening, I asked for help from her friend (who was dating my friend) to deliver the gift. But she returned it through her best friend.

Months passed, and by June, I turned 18. Inspired by a viral Instagram reel, I jokingly asked my friends to “gift me a date with her.” Around this time, I created a meme page for my college and followed everyone, including her best friend. On June 14, I posted a “Guess the Admin” story, and only her best friend replied—the same one who had returned my gift.

I playfully revealed my identity, and that night, I sent her the image of the necklace. She was surprised, and for the first time in months, I felt a small hope.

Then, 10 days later, her best friend told me she was leaving the college because her father, a police officer, was transferred to another city. I thought, *Maybe this is why fate brought us back into contact—so I could know before she left.* Her best friend was heartbroken, and I even went to college on her last day, hoping she’d talk to me one last time. But she didn’t.

Later, I had an emotional chat with her best friend, and I decided to message her on WhatsApp for closure. This time, I wrote a heartfelt message (not AI-generated), and it made her emotional. After some back-and-forth, I asked if she’d meet me for a final coffee. She agreed.

On the day of the meet-up, I brought her flowers. And then she dropped a bombshell—she wasn’t leaving the city, just changing colleges. I was over the moon, thinking, *God, is this your plan?* I came home feeling like I had won the lottery.

But then, a few hours later, she messaged me: *Please don’t keep any hope.*

A few days later, I got frustrated and asked her about it. We fought. And ladies and gentlemen… I lost.

In England 

Was delivered a large very heavy coffee table, it arrived damaged, after a bit of hassle with the company this morning I woke up to an email saying I have been refunded and they will not be collecting the product and I need to dispose of it how I see fit.

All well and good, and luckily I can get a friend to take it to the dump for me. But it made me think and wonder the legality of this, as if I did not have a friend who could drive I would be stuck with a very heavy and large coffee table I do not want, and I would have to incur cost to remove? Should the company be liable for the cost of the disposal? It seems wrong that a customer should incur costs for a faulty item. 

I know it would probably be not worth the hassle to go after any costs, but I just was curious if technically it is legal for a company to allow someone be burdened with the cost of removing furniture that was sent damaged.",0,1738153491.0,LegalAdviceUK,4,0.5,False

I hope that this will inspire some of y'all to go rediscover some of the things that make Charleston unique and jam-pack it all into about a12 hour day.

Our day got started late because traffic to come pick me up was bad, so instead of Harbinger Cafe, we had Scooters (its a chain but we coffee and yapped in the traffic 10/10)

Ok onto the real stuff. We parked in central downtown, I am always a Visitors Center Garage girlie, but parking lower on the peninsula was a must. We were able to run back to the car to drop stuff off, grab our waters, take a break, recoop, etc.

1. Carriage Tour with Carolina Polo & Carriage Co -- I know \*I KNOW\* love or hate it, this was really worth it. We parked and immediately went to book our timeslot. We were able to get on a 10AM tour, and our guide was lovely, local, and fed no BS. Our horse Amigo was a cutie. Booking the tour, we used Groupon, but when we went in, the manager said if you are local, just come in, and they will offer you the Groupon rate, and they then get the full cut of that rate. They \*are\* local businesses after all. Tour was about an hour long.
2. Walk the Market - we walked until 11:25ish not much was open/set up, I assume because it is January, but if I were gainfully employed and not a student, I would have bought a sweetgrass basket (a girl can dream to have one someday).
3. Lunch at Magnolias - we shared Brussels sprouts, Crab Bisque, fried green tomato sandwich, and the rockfish fried fish sandwich with sweet potato fries
4. Hushpuppy sample from Hymans -- IDC if its a mid tourist trap, I AM STOPPING FOR A FREE HUSHPUPPY!
5. Waterfront Park to the Pineapple Fountain -- dipped our toes in, we prob have a fungus now but you gotta do what you gotta do to as cliche as possible
6. Walked down to the Battery (wish it was not under construction anymore, but is what it is)
7. Walked to Rainbow Row
8. Philadelphia Alley -- gotta go in the day time so you dont get haunted
9. Onto King and we do a little shopping, treat yo self, etc
10. Candlefish Workshop -- I booked this in advance for 2-3:30 PM, we had a super fun time, it was a small group because it was a Tuesday
11. Little more King Street shopping
12. Carmellas -- walked back to East Bay around 4PM for a drink and split a cannoli cake (15/10 would hurt myself on this again), yapped until about 5:15
13. R Kitchen -- we decided to book in West Ashley; the vibes are immaculate, and the food fantastic, It is probably my favorite place to eat in Charleston and has been for years.

All in all we spent from about 9:30AM to 8:30PM out and about on the town. I have a renewed appreciation for the city I call home and I encourage everyone to try and take a day to be a tourist in your own town.

Things we missed or skipped

* morning coffee -- traffic was ass, so we opted for scooters, but I would have gone for Harbringer or Sightsee
* alternative lunch options -- Berkelys, Verns, Porchetta shop
* pedi cab ride -- we were too socially awkward to solicit those thighs
* roof top drinks
* we skipped our usual stop at Off Track
* we did not make it to a museum but it was on our bingo card

I also made Cliche Charleston Day Bingo cards for us to see how many bingos we could get in one day. Its by no means an exhaustive list, but I think it made for a fun little activity:

I 25m and my sister 23f went to a coffee shop yesterday. Recently I have wanted to buy an anime waifu pillow to use but since I don't have a job ,I have not been to afford it. Since I live at my parents house I asked if they would buy for me and they said no. Now I really want this waifs pillow but I don't really want to get a job. Yes this might sound bad but my autism makes it hard for me to work and understand social cues.

So we went into the coffee shop and ordered some coffee. There was a pregnant woman sitting down, her baby diapers needed to be changed so she went to the bathroom to do so. When she left, she had accidentally left her wallet on the counter. After she left I realised it was there so I went over to it and decided to take out some money. There was $150. Enough for the pillow. I decided to take it.

When she came back, she realised the money was gone and she asked the baristas if they had seen anything. They said no. She was upset as apparently she needed the money for rent (or something else) and asked to check security. They said they were no working cameras. She was devastated. We decided to leave as we had finished our coffees.

When we were walking home, my sister noticed I had money in my hands. She realised I took it from the lady. She immediately said we needed to go back and give it to her but I said no. We started arguing and since then we haven't talked. Today I decided to get the pillow with the money.

1icsg7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/seekamari/comments/1icsg7m/what_is_regressive_overload/,What is Regressive Overload?,"The earliest points of my journey start with this attempt to quantify what is happening in modern times.  
Obesity, mental health issues, and cancers are all increasing, predominantly as a result of our toxic environment.

Poor sleep, stress, censorship, and dopamine manipulation are systems of the 21st century that, quite clearly, act as mechanisms for the devolution of humankind.

As human beings, we are the only species on the planet with the conscious potential for improvement.

**Progressive overload** is a well-known principle in weight training, but it applies across every aspect of human growth.  
Consistently challenging your mind, skills, and body within your genetic limitations leads to improvement.

But if this is true, there must be an inverse.

# Regressive Overload: The Silent Erosion of Growth

It’s **Regressive Overload**—the slow accumulation of **chronobiological and neurobiological dysfunction** that erodes **cognitive function and physical health over time**. It describes the residual effects of daily stressors—environmental, psychological, and behavioral—that gradually wear down resilience, mental clarity, and overall well-being.

**State management** is a **neurobiological framework** designed to counteract regressive overload, allowing individuals to regulate cognitive states and biological rhythms for optimal function.

# Key Aspects of Regressive Overload:

**Neurobiological Overload**

* Excessive stimulation of the brain’s reward and stress systems—through dopamine manipulation from technology, social media, and food—creates an environment that initiates a downward spiral for the human body.
* Results in decreased neuroplasticity, decision fatigue, and impaired executive function.

It is this impairment of cognitive environment that disruption natural biological rhythms leading to Inconsistent sleep-wake cycles, artificial light exposure, and irregular eating patterns disrupt natural biological rhythms. Hormonal imbalances (e.g., cortisol and melatonin misalignment), reducing the body's ability to recover.

The Residual natural of regressive overload is the Cumulative Sleep Deficiency: In essence when you impact the day you impact the night and the result of this is that you have already impacted tomorrow. 

Ever wake up after a terrible night's sleep, slammed an early coffee, craved carbohydrates or not have the emotional capacity to say no to the sweet thing. 

That is regressive overload. 

**The system around you is designed to extract profit from you. When it purposely manipulates your dopamine system, it degrades your control and impairs your ability to make rational decisions. It constantly pushes individuals to optimize and hustle, but without understanding regressive overload, the pursuit of progress becomes self-defeating. Over time, unmanaged overload leads to burnout, sleep disorders, and diminished performance in all areas of life.**

You are not designed to run at full capacity indefinitely.

The brain and your biological rhythms follow a natural ebb and flow—periods of **input and output**, of **manipulation and consolidation** of information. Ignoring this cycle leads to cognitive and physiological breakdown.  
  
We can all better manage regressive overload by understanding STATE.

I miss the actually good storylines in Tekken,"Not only that, but that they were taken more seriously too. The world of Tekken has its funny and weird moments that wouldn't make sense in the real world, and i appreciate that they exist, but I liked when they were taken seriously despite the fact.

The story of Tekken 8 disappointed me to say the least. Not only through the main story but even through character interactions that don't make sense, arent developed or aren't explained. 

All of a sudden Lars, Leroy and everybody else from the resistance treat Jin like the good Mishima as if Jin didn't cause World War 3 just a few months ago story wise. That's just stupid. Did everybody get and amnesia and just forget the millions of lives he took?

Heihachi Mishima survived, which makes the whole story of Tekken 7 and all of that emotional buildup just pointless. Instead of actually bringing back Heihachi in the story too, just see what you did a few years ago in Tekken 7 Bandai Namco with Kazumi, and make him a memory of when Kazuya fought him. We get to play as Heihachi, you get to make a ton of money, it can make sense in the story as it did in Tekken 7 and everyone is happy, It's a win win for everybody.

Law for some reason looking younger than his own son, decided to aid Kazuya in destroying the world because, he wants money? He was mad at Paul that he didn't split the money with him from the tournament prize and so he decided to help Kazuya destory the whole world, because he wants money? Yeah ok.

Lili and Azucena have a beef with each other because, one likes tea and the other likes coffee. Ok? No other reason? Fine.

Asuka is once again, completely irrelevant to the story even though she was set up to be a very important character. She has the healing/cleansing powers of her mother, Jun Kazama, that help with the Devil Gene, but ever since Tekken 5 there hasn't been a **single** mention of her having those super powers, nor has she been relevant to the story since then.

Claudio joined the resistance and became good all of a sudden, even though in my opinion he was a much more interesting character when he was evil/nefarious and wanted to take advantage of Xiaoyu to find Jin, but that storyline was thrown out the window because, again, all of a sudden he is a good guy. Great.

King's and Steve's interactions are sort of interesting, but they haven't been developed in the story, because the story focuses entirely on the Mishimas 90% of the time, which yeah the Mishimas of course are cool, they are awesome, but why can't we get a bit more ipnteresting character interactions from the rest of the cast? Show their own stories, show more of them!

To give credit to Bandai Namco, Reina is the most interesting newcomer from Tekken 8, and i was really excited with her. Though her coolness factor was reduced because shocker, she herself has the devil gene which I don't know how that happened, and I **really** wish it didn't happen, but fine. What's a few more interesting storylines being neutered to being more lame.

I could go on and on but i believe I've proved my point. In general my issue is that Bandai Namco has a genuine problem with developing these character's stories or doing anything interesting with them at all, and they leave a lot to be desired. Some character have unfortunately have stayed with the same storyline for what has been **decades** and it's genuinely so tiring to see them undeveloped. Especially when videogames nowadays take years to develop, and the bigger they get, the more expectations rise, and when competitors do it better, you need to step it up.
