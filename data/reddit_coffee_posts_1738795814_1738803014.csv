Ply here from Rogue Wave Coffee. A long update today.. 

This month code is LoveYourCoffeeYourWay or use [this link](https://roguewavecoffee.ca/discount/LoveYourCoffeeYourWay) for 10% off coffee, mech, MX.cool, and until next update, will work on drinkware as well. There are a few things to update, first of....


Coffee - Lots of new coffees! Watch out for New fruity decaf this week! Wilton Benitez (Granja Paraiso 92) Sidra is also back. And Kenya CM Natural from Maguta Estate as well! The Ethiopia Wush Wush (region) Red Honey has been tasting good, and the Nguisse Nare Murago is quite blue berry forward, if that is your Jam.  

Gears! Big Origami restock are hopefully will come by the end of the month. We have some new Cafede Kona stuff, and also Femobook A4Z as well! 

Now to a more important stuff

**Tariff** to USA.

As many of our customers are from the States, right now shipping to USA is somewhat not stable. While Tariff for Canada is halted for a few more weeks, this is not the case for China, and this can impact your order. This Tariff on China, is also tariff on products made in China, even if it is shipped from other countires. So some of your grinders, scales, milk pitcher, glasswares, etc these items can get, and will, get pull into formal clearance, as ""de minimis"" excemption are now not eligible for products of China (as well as shipment originated in China).

Quote from the Departmment of Homeland Security of USA [Document](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-02293.pdf)

""The additional ad valorem duty provided for in new HTSUS heading 9903.01.20 applies in addition to all other applicable duties, taxes, fees, exactions, and charges. Further, the February 1, 2025 Executive Order clarifies that duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 U.S.C.1321 shall not be available for the articles of China subject to the additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty. Accordingly, articles covered by heading 9903.01.20 shall not be eligible for the administrative exemption from duty and certain taxes at 19 U.S.C. 1321(a)(2)(C) — the so-called “de minimis” exemption.""


**So please be mindful when you purchase stuff from us, or from other places shipped internationally to USA** as you will likely be responsible for duties and brokerage fees. Looking at the current rate, it seems like the minimum are around $32 USD per shipment for clearance. If you are purchasing something from outside the US, you would be consider an importer for said item(s). 


**SO FAR - our coffees, and products that are not manufacturer in China seems to have no problem with express clearance, and are not subject to tariff, duties, or brokerage fees.** In the next few days, we will update the listing for our items  to include where the items are made from, so that you can make an inform purchase. 

To say its been a stressful week would be an understatement. Thank you for your all your support and orders, we really really really do appreciate it.

Where to start. I genuinely hate writing these posts because I feel like I never tell or say enough. I guess I just have to hope for the best yet again. I'd love nothing more than to find a soulmate and a partner for life here but I know that's very rare and will probably not happen. Blah blah, at least I'm trying.

So yes, 'tis I. I'm 23 and I live in Finland, born and bred. I have a lovely borzoi dog and I live in a wonderful apartment near my parents. Family means everything to me. I'm a graduated hairdresser/barber and I am currently studying history and archeology online. I love cinema and writing (actually finished a poetry collection a month back) and also read, draw and sing in my free time (although I suck big fat redacted at singing). I am also a feminist, I love coffee, LOTR and I would do anything for the people I love.

That brings us to you!

From you, I would hope you're a decent human being. I have had my fair share of man children and trauma. I think it's a fair ask. I also hope you are good at speaking English and can keep up with my wittiness. I don't mind if we don't share the same music taste or if you don't like going to museums and discussing knights — what matters most is that we get along and our values match.

Now, I know bots and trolls are gonna swarm my DMs, so this is important: in your opening message, tell me your name, age, country and anything else you want to add — it could be about yourself or why you decided you want to get to know me.

\------------

*“A curtain of night under a bejeweled sky.”*

In a flash, I remembered Lucy was under the same sky. But not with me.

She was with Barb.

I wrenched my phone out of my pocket; the heavens tinting the screen ghostly, neon colors as I saw what I ignored while searching for *The Last Great Seer.*

4 missed calls from Lucy, followed by a text message and a picture.

*“Barb gathered nearly everyone at the chapel, except Ari. Practically everyone in town was tormented by the prophecy when they were young. They’re all acting crazy. What they’re talking about doing is insane. Come ASAP and bring Shep.”*

Although none of us are religious, we use an abandoned Pentecostal church as our town hall. It’s the biggest communal space we have.

The picture was hazy and out of focus, which I took to mean that Lucy had taken it in secret. There was a white board next to the pulpit, which was covered in things like:

***-Excavate its jades from their hallowed sockets, and their visions of Apocalypse will cease. ?Remove eyes. (5 Tally marks next to it)***

***-Excise the bull’s manhood, and Apocalypse will fall. ?Castration (2 Tally marks)***

***-Flay its carapace, and Apocalypse will be exposed. ?Skinning (4 Tally marks)***

The list went on and on.

Standing at the pulpit, I could clearly see Barb, eyes burning with frenzy, hands gesturing wildly toward the pews.

\------------

*“Barbara…you need to stand down,”* Shep growled, his words echoing up into the rafters of the vast cathedral.

Hundreds of bodies turned in the pews to face the sheriff as he and I entered. There had been lively chatter when we first walked in, with the entire town debating the most appropriate violence to inflict on Ari, our green-eyed harbinger. Now, there was only silence. A thick, suffocating quiet, made dense by the thousands of words that lingered impatiently on people’s tongues but remained unsaid.

I peered around from behind Shepard, trying to locate my wife in the frozen mob. As my eyes moved up the length of the church, I eventually found her. Ahead of the pews, there was a raised area with a pulpit and an altar. A rusty pipe organ mounted against the back wall framed the stage, with its dilapidated metal cylinders curving around the pulpit like the tendrils of a kraken twisting around the hull of a ship.

Lucy was sitting on the bench in front of the organ, deeply sequestered behind rows of townspeople and Barbara, who stood in front of the pulpit, head shaking with divine indignation like a magistrate looking upon a convicted witch at Salem.

*“Shepard, what right do you have to overthrow the will of the people? You work for us, not the other way around,”* she boomed from the safety of her podium.

Murmurs of agreement radiated throughout the crowd. Barb had clearly persuaded them, but they hadn’t completely succumbed to frenzy.

Not yet, at least.

*“Open your eyes, sheriff. That whale died on our shore. The birds aren’t flying. The town lacks electricity, and a strange light pervades the sky. All on the same day, all after Ari’s arrival. Do you think we enjoy convening by candlelight? Do you truly believe our pain had no purpose?”*

To my astonishment, I found myself agreeing with Barb. A peculiar relief poured over me as I listened. Involuntarily, I swallowed and nodded my head.

Shep turned and shot me a look of pure disgust, having sensed my wavering allegiance. As much as I treasured his respect, and as much as I knew what we were considering was morally unconscionable, I couldn’t help but find comfort in Barb’s narrative. We had all suffered at the feet of this prophecy, and we had endured that suffering alone - until today. The warmth that came from a room full of people that understood felt like morphine in my blood.

*“Alright folks, let make this all abundantly clear for you.”*

The sheriff walked forward onto the carpeted aisle as he spoke, leaving me and my smoldering collusion behind.

*“I do not deny your pain. Nor am I saying that I understand what’s happening here today. I don’t think anyone has a good explanation for what all of that is.”*

He beckoned out one of the cathedral’s tall windows at the blankets of blue-green light swimming ominously through the night sky. But there was something else on the glass that he didn’t call our attention to. Something that caused the hairs on the nape of my neck to stand on end.

Tiny beads of dripping liquid, absorbing and refracting the cosmic light as they painted long lines down the window. Every tempest starts as a drizzle of rain.

I started pacing forward to grab Shep, knowing what could be next to follow.

*“I wish I understood your pain, and I wish I understood what you experienced, truly, I do,”* he continued.

*“But here’s something I do understand. It’s simple, and it’s universally applicable: ‘Thou shalt not kill’. The activities y’all have listed up on that whiteboard - castration, skinning, hobbling, amputating, blinding - they’ll kill that poor man. And he won’t pass on quietly, neither. So, ask yourselves: something is demanding y’all do those things to Ari, but is it worth giving up your humanity to do it? I know the prophecy says a lake of fire will eat the world if you don’t hurt him, but I mean, if you become demons to save us, did you really avoid creating hell?”*

When I reached him, he was nearly at the pulpit, looking up to meet Barb’s burning gaze. Wind whipped against the church’s rickety woodwork, causing the walls to seemingly buckle and expand with the current. Hefty droplets of rainfall crashed against the rooftop like the hooves of a stampede. I grabbed his forearm and pulled myself up to my tiptoes so my whispers could meet his ear.

*“I know you don’t believe this is happening, but we need to go. The next part of the prophecy is ‘the death of a king amidst a sweeping Tempest. We haven’t had a mayor in over a decade, so you’re the closest thing this town has to a king.”*

Barb’s voice cut through the sounds of the storm like a crack of thunder.

*“Meghan! Are you conspiring with the Sheriff? Are the both of you planning on standing in the way of what needs to be done?”*

People rose from the pews, staring daggers into Shep and I. At first, it was just a handful. But the more venom Barb spewed, the more of our neighbors answered her call.

*“They have chosen us! The universe, in its infinite wisdom, has selected us to prevent Apocalypse. Would you really deprive of us of our destiny and damn the world to conflagration, all just to protect a man who you hardly even know? An outsider, no less?”*

A crowd gathered in the aisle, preventing our only escape route. I swung my head from side to side, looking for an opening, a hole in the mob that Shep and I might be able to squeeze through, but I found nothing.

With the people closing in on us, I turned to face the sheriff, who had become eerily motionless in the preceding few seconds. When I saw his expression, my heart transformed from meat into lead and it plummeted through the bottom of my chest.

His eyes were empty and glazed over, like marbles painted to resemble human eyes. The left half of his face sagged unnaturally downward, making it look like those features were being subjected to a different, more potent force of gravity than his right. A stream of dribble fell from the corner of his mouth and down his chin, dripping on to my shirt collar as I stood paralyzed in front of him.

Before anyone actually reached us, Shepard crumpled to the floor like a discarded marionette, limp and lifeless. The crowd stopped moving, and the room once again became filled with that thick silence.

I followed him to the floor, knelling over him with hot tears welling up in my eyes.

*“Shep - Shep…oh God…oh God.”*

No matter how much I called out to him, no matter how much I shook him, Shep would didn’t wake up. He’d never wake up again, actually.

My eyes darted around the room, but no one was dialing 9-1-1.

*“Phones still work, right?!”* I screamed in disbelief.

*“What the fuck are you all waiting for? He’s having a stroke?!”* I bellowed through my sobs.

No one moved an inch.

*“Fuck all of you, fuck all of you right to hell.”*

My hand moved to pull my cellphone from my back pocket, but somebody caught my wrist from behind and held it tightly in the air.

I assumed it was Barb, so I balled my other hand into a sturdy fist and swung it towards my captor, but it never made contact. Shock and despair caused the punch to dissolve mid-flight.

Lucy was the one who was holding me back.

“*Good job, sweetheart.”* Barb cooed from behind the pulpit.

Still on the floor of the cathedral next to the dying man, my breathing became ragged and my muscles turned into puddy. Flickering candlelight danced over Lucy’s face as I looked into it for answers. Resignation and sorrow marked her expression, but it was clear that she acted calmly and deliberately. Apparently, my wife was more than willing to let Shep perish in an undignified heap on the ground with the whole town watching, a fate that mirrored the stranded leviathan in a way that twisted my stomach into knots.

*“I’m…”* is the only word Lucy vocalized before Barb started delivering commands.

*“Juan, gather the rope from your car so we can restrain Meghan. Trisha, I want you to take Jeremy, Phil, and Weijen out to the 23rd. Ari’s house is the blue ranchero on the corner. Avery, Tom, Martha - could you kindly pull the sheriff’s body out back? The church has a freezer, but there’s still no electricity. We can’t preserve him. Best we can do is an impromptu burial.”*

She then stepped forward from the pulpit slightly to crane her neck around the whiteboard.

*“Looks like the majority of us recall that last instruction to be* ***excavate its jades from their hallowed sockets, and their visions of Apocalypse will cease,*** *so I guess we’ll start there.”*

\-----------

Once the mob tied me to a folding chair, they at least had the decency to place me next to Lucy, up on the stage by the pipe organ. I think they viewed it as decency, at least. In reality, I would have preferred being tossed into the wet dirt next to a possibly still alive Shepard.

Her betrayal had cut so deep.

She tried to justify her actions, but I wasn’t having any of it. This town and its people were Shep’s life, and this is how they chose to repay him. He was there when our basement flooded, lugging water logged furniture onto our lawn in the summer heat. When Lucy’s parents died in a car crash, he sat at our kitchen table and drank coffee with us every day for a month, listening intently and giving advice where he could. When we finally thought IVF worked, only to have it end in a miscarriage, Shep was there to give me a shoulder to cry on. Lucy, perpetually avoidant of discomfort, was off drinking by herself somewhere farther into the mainland.

That was just *our* lives, though. Every person in that church probably had their own collection of stories, iterating Shepard’s wisdom, kindness, and philanthropy. And every single person in that church let him expire on the floor like a mutt. It felt unbelievable, but that was actually the better of the two potential outcomes, too. No one took his pulse as they carried him out of the cathedral, despite my pleas. He might not have died on the church floor. Instead, Shep may have died in a cold pit, mud and soil filling his lungs as he stared helplessly up into the faces of his neighbors as they proceeded to bury him alive.

From their perspective, feeling for a heartbeat was a gamble that had no upside. Barb wanted him in the ground, so he was going into that hole, dead or alive. Why risk confirming that they were sentencing the man to a premature burial?

Dwelling on it made me physically sick.

When I saw a group of them re-entering the church with Ari, his face black and blue from a beating, my anguish turned into something more useful; seething rage.

*“****Does any of this even make any goddamned sense****?”* I screamed, cheeks and chest flushed bright red.

My outburst was abrupt and unexpected. Startled, a few people nearly jumped out of their own skin. Lucy included.

*“I get the insanity of us all being tormented by the prophecy, but I mean, think about it: Ari’s been here for over a week. Its not like everything happened the moment he stepped foot in town. We live on the coast. We’ve had beached whales before, remember?*

*“We’re going to torture and kill a man over a beached whale, a few dumb birds, and some faulty wiring?”*

*“And* ***why*** *would there be these differences in the prophetic instructions? I counted sixteen separate lines listed on that white board. Does* ***anyone*** *have a good way to explain that? For fuck’s sake, what the would be the point?”*

Barb turned to face me, and I swear I saw her chuckle. I think she tried to get a word in edge-wise, but that goddamned chuckle was like throwing a cannister of gasoline into a bonfire.

*“****And Shepard! Fucking Shepard****. He was the sheriff, you fucking lunatics. He wasn’t a king. They aren’t even close to the same position! Barb is forcing a square peg through a circular hole, but you all are so brainwashed that you’re not even thinking about it!”*

*“This isn’t some divine responsibility. This isn’t the universe asking us to be brave in the face of Apocalypse. No, this is…this is something else.”*

Unfortunately, I felt myself losing steam. They had just brought Ari onto the stage. Seeing his wild, fearful eyes and his bloody, swollen mouth up close was diluting my focus.

*“If…if someone can just look at my phone, I have proof. There was…there was a burn…some type of burn on the whale…I mean the Leviathan. There’s…something going on that we don’t completely understand. Shep…oh God, Shep…he drove me over to the boardwalk. We…we saw The Last Great Seer. There was a plug in the back…I think…I think that it could be used like a telephone…”*

Juan, a burly Dominican man who ran the local deli, forcefully pushed the green-eyed harbinger into a folding chair so he was facing me, only a few feet away. Ari peered up at his captor, mumbling pleas of mercy through intermittent sobs. Absentmindedly, the outsider tried to meet Juan’s gaze by swiveling his torso, rather than remaining still as instructed. Ari wasn’t trying to escape, that much was clear. He was trying to make an appeal to his humanity by looking into his eyes.

A set of knuckles careened into his jaw in response to that appeal, releasing the sickening type of crunch that accompanies bone crushing bone.

The young man toppled from the folding chair onto the floor. I watched in horror as Juan, Barb and a few others circled around him like carrion birds flying above fresh road kill. Anytime he moved, the group sent a flurry of kicks into his ribs and abdomen. Once they had tenderized him to the point of near unconsciousness, they dragged his limp body back into the folding chair and secured him with the same rope they had used to secure me.

*“You’re all fucking animals…”* I whispered.

Ari’s head hung motionless, chin to chest. The metallic scent of newly liberated blood drifted through the air like smoke. Even though I was unharmed, I could still almost taste it, wet copper lurching over the tip of my tongue.

*“****You’re all…fucking…animals-****”* my scream muffled by someone behind me stuffing a sock into my mouth.

A barrage of primal shrieks leapt up from my vocal cords, but they barely made any noise through the thick fabric. With both of their prisoners subdued, Barb, Juan and the rest of the group jumped off the stage, discussing preparations for the main event with the crowd of people that was gathering in the aisle.

Slowly, Ari lifted his head to midline. To my confusion, his expression of fear had dissipated, seemingly beaten out of him. He concentrated, perking his ears and moving his eyes from side to side, clearly trying to determine if there was anyone nearby. Satisfied that no one was within earshot, he dragged his eyes forward to meet mine.

They were almost bulging from their sockets. Not with terror. Not with confusion. His jades were agape with frenzy, somehow burning even brighter than Barb’s were.

I felt my thoughts freeze and body overheat like an old radiator as I observed the corners of Ari’s mouth curl upwards.

He smiled at me.

With no one else watching, his lips contorted into a rapturous Cheshire Cat’s grin, violent and uncanny.

Ari tilted his head forward, cloaking everything but his teeth in shadow. Quivering candles illuminated his jaw with a frail spotlight, and I couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by a grim nostalgia.

Just like *The Last Great Seer did* forty years prior, Ari seared a series of apocalyptic words into my consciousness. But these words were new. And unlike the prophecy, these words may have truly been conjured for me alone.

*“Kings can bleed, governments can collapse, and Gods…Gods can fade. These masters can die because they’re artificial. We made them.”*

*“But superstition…superstition is immortal. Its tangled within us, to our very core. It’s undying because it’s hereditary, a ghost in our DNA.”*

*“You can’t kill the inseparable, Meghan.”*

Suddenly, as quickly as it came, the green-eyed harbinger’s grin vanished

With his mask of fear nailed on tight, Ari placed his chin to his chest and waited for deliverance.

\-----------

I find myself unwilling or unable to detail what came next.

Just know that, by the time the town was finished with him, Ari had been thoroughly disassembled.

Until the break of dawn, they worked their way down the white board’s profane list. From what I could tell, the original plan was to only subject Ari to the violent instructions that held a majority from the town’s combined memories.

But bloodletting always begets more bloodletting.

This is the Apocalypse we’re talking about, after all. And they couldn’t be one hundred percent sure which vile act was the key to saving us.

Better safe than sorry, right?

When the sun rose, unaccompanied by conflagration, they patted themselves on the back.

They buried what remained of Ari, if that’s even his real name, in an unmarked grave next to Shepard.

And that’s what hurt me the most.

\-----------

Have you ever heard of a geomagnetic storm?

I sure as shit hadn’t, not until a man claiming to be an environmental services worker called our home the morning after our town enacted the prophecy. They told me they were looking to speak to Shep, that he had called them about a beached whale twenty four hours ago. Now, for whatever reason, they found themselves unable to reach him. They believed they had an explanation for what happened, and they wanted to pass that explanation along.

I won’t pretend like I understand the science of it all, but I can give you all the broad strokes.

Rarely, when the sun emits a wave of energy, known as a solar wind, it can reach earth and disrupt our magnetic fields. Now, stop me if any of these phenomena sound familiar.

Animals like birds, which rely on internal magnetism to guide migration, can become disoriented when magnetic fields are disrupted, grounding themselves until their physiology is restored. In some cases, whales have been known to beach themselves, as they also rely on magnetism for guidance.

Electrical systems can fail, too. Hell, some theorists have speculated that magnetic shifts can cause the formation of a transient Aurora Borelias in places that aren’t normally associated with that type of cosmic occurrence.

At first, I’m wondering why I’m being told all of this. But then, it hits me. Another grim nostalgia.

I’m listening to the hollow, monotoned voice from my childhood. They hid it at first, no doubt wanting to keep me on the line long enough to gloat. As they finished confirming my suspicions that everything our town did was not born of divine purpose, however, they let the masquerade fall.

Once I realized it was them, I hung up. I didn’t need to hear anymore.

\-----------

You might ask yourself, what’s the point? Well, here it is.

I think we were all part of some grand experiment. Someone wanted to prove that they could condition a group of people to commit heinous atrocities without the justification of patriotism, financial incentive, or religious zealotry. They wanted to show that intelligent, well-adjusted members of society could enact hell on earth in pursuit of preventing an Apocalypse, ignoring any contradictory information that may stand in their way. All they needed was a way to manifest apocalyptic conditions at the right time, which, apparently, involved a localized disruption of magnetic fields.

They may have to nudge the circumstances along, of course. Maybe a Leviathan didn’t beach itself as intended, so they sent someone down to electrocute the damn thing, and then they pulled it to shore.

They felt so confident in their hypothesis, in fact, that they said:

*“Hey - I bet these animals will do it even if we give them different instructions on how to do it. That’s how well this going to work.”*

The point is this: our group was just a prototype. A trial run of sorts. I believe we were preparation for a larger, more horrific conditioning event.

So, I’m here to provide a cautionary tale. It’s the least I can do for Shepard.

Look around you. How many of your coworkers, friends, and family members use astrology to guide their actions? We think we’ve evolved beyond myth and superstition, but that’s an outright lie, and the belief hurts us more than it helps us. We need to be vigilant against this type of control.

Don’t believe me?

Pull out your phone, open the application store, and search for the phrase “*The Last Great Seer”.* Should be a new release, listed under astrology or cosmology.

*“A curtain of night under a bejeweled sky.”*

In a flash, I remembered Lucy was under the same sky. But not with me.

She was with Barb.

I wrenched my phone out of my pocket; the heavens tinting the screen ghostly, neon colors as I saw what I ignored while searching for *The Last Great Seer.*

4 missed calls from Lucy, followed by a text message and a picture.

*“Barb gathered nearly everyone at the chapel, except Ari. Practically everyone in town was tormented by the prophecy when they were young. They’re all acting crazy. What they’re talking about doing is insane. Come ASAP and bring Shep.”*

Although none of us are religious, we use an abandoned Pentecostal church as our town hall. It’s the biggest communal space we have.

The picture was hazy and out of focus, which I took to mean that Lucy had taken it in secret. There was a white board next to the pulpit, which was covered in things like:

***-Excavate its jades from their hallowed sockets, and their visions of Apocalypse will cease. ?Remove eyes. (5 Tally marks next to it)***

***-Excise the bull’s manhood, and Apocalypse will fall. ?Castration (2 Tally marks)***

***-Flay its carapace, and Apocalypse will be exposed. ?Skinning (4 Tally marks)***

The list went on and on.

Standing at the pulpit, I could clearly see Barb, eyes burning with frenzy, hands gesturing wildly toward the pews.

\------------

*“Barbara…you need to stand down,”* Shep growled, his words echoing up into the rafters of the vast cathedral.

Hundreds of bodies turned in the pews to face the sheriff as he and I entered. There had been lively chatter when we first walked in, with the entire town debating the most appropriate violence to inflict on Ari, our green-eyed harbinger. Now, there was only silence. A thick, suffocating quiet, made dense by the thousands of words that lingered impatiently on people’s tongues but remained unsaid.

I peered around from behind Shepard, trying to locate my wife in the frozen mob. As my eyes moved up the length of the church, I eventually found her. Ahead of the pews, there was a raised area with a pulpit and an altar. A rusty pipe organ mounted against the back wall framed the stage, with its dilapidated metal cylinders curving around the pulpit like the tendrils of a kraken twisting around the hull of a ship.

Lucy was sitting on the bench in front of the organ, deeply sequestered behind rows of townspeople and Barbara, who stood in front of the pulpit, head shaking with divine indignation like a magistrate looking upon a convicted witch at Salem.

*“Shepard, what right do you have to overthrow the will of the people? You work for us, not the other way around,”* she boomed from the safety of her podium.

Murmurs of agreement radiated throughout the crowd. Barb had clearly persuaded them, but they hadn’t completely succumbed to frenzy.

Not yet, at least.

*“Open your eyes, sheriff. That whale died on our shore. The birds aren’t flying. The town lacks electricity, and a strange light pervades the sky. All on the same day, all after Ari’s arrival. Do you think we enjoy convening by candlelight? Do you truly believe our pain had no purpose?”*

To my astonishment, I found myself agreeing with Barb. A peculiar relief poured over me as I listened. Involuntarily, I swallowed and nodded my head.

Shep turned and shot me a look of pure disgust, having sensed my wavering allegiance. As much as I treasured his respect, and as much as I knew what we were considering was morally unconscionable, I couldn’t help but find comfort in Barb’s narrative. We had all suffered at the feet of this prophecy, and we had endured that suffering alone - until today. The warmth that came from a room full of people that understood felt like morphine in my blood.

*“Alright folks, let make this all abundantly clear for you.”*

The sheriff walked forward onto the carpeted aisle as he spoke, leaving me and my smoldering collusion behind.

*“I do not deny your pain. Nor am I saying that I understand what’s happening here today. I don’t think anyone has a good explanation for what all of that is.”*

He beckoned out one of the cathedral’s tall windows at the blankets of blue-green light swimming ominously through the night sky. But there was something else on the glass that he didn’t call our attention to. Something that caused the hairs on the nape of my neck to stand on end.

Tiny beads of dripping liquid, absorbing and refracting the cosmic light as they painted long lines down the window. Every tempest starts as a drizzle of rain.

I started pacing forward to grab Shep, knowing what could be next to follow.

*“I wish I understood your pain, and I wish I understood what you experienced, truly, I do,”* he continued.

*“But here’s something I do understand. It’s simple, and it’s universally applicable: ‘Thou shalt not kill’. The activities y’all have listed up on that whiteboard - castration, skinning, hobbling, amputating, blinding - they’ll kill that poor man. And he won’t pass on quietly, neither. So, ask yourselves: something is demanding y’all do those things to Ari, but is it worth giving up your humanity to do it? I know the prophecy says a lake of fire will eat the world if you don’t hurt him, but I mean, if you become demons to save us, did you really avoid creating hell?”*

When I reached him, he was nearly at the pulpit, looking up to meet Barb’s burning gaze. Wind whipped against the church’s rickety woodwork, causing the walls to seemingly buckle and expand with the current. Hefty droplets of rainfall crashed against the rooftop like the hooves of a stampede. I grabbed his forearm and pulled myself up to my tiptoes so my whispers could meet his ear.

*“I know you don’t believe this is happening, but we need to go. The next part of the prophecy is ‘the death of a king amidst a sweeping Tempest. We haven’t had a mayor in over a decade, so you’re the closest thing this town has to a king.”*

Barb’s voice cut through the sounds of the storm like a crack of thunder.

*“Meghan! Are you conspiring with the Sheriff? Are the both of you planning on standing in the way of what needs to be done?”*

People rose from the pews, staring daggers into Shep and I. At first, it was just a handful. But the more venom Barb spewed, the more of our neighbors answered her call.

*“They have chosen us! The universe, in its infinite wisdom, has selected us to prevent Apocalypse. Would you really deprive of us of our destiny and damn the world to conflagration, all just to protect a man who you hardly even know? An outsider, no less?”*

A crowd gathered in the aisle, preventing our only escape route. I swung my head from side to side, looking for an opening, a hole in the mob that Shep and I might be able to squeeze through, but I found nothing.

With the people closing in on us, I turned to face the sheriff, who had become eerily motionless in the preceding few seconds. When I saw his expression, my heart transformed from meat into lead and it plummeted through the bottom of my chest.

His eyes were empty and glazed over, like marbles painted to resemble human eyes. The left half of his face sagged unnaturally downward, making it look like those features were being subjected to a different, more potent force of gravity than his right. A stream of dribble fell from the corner of his mouth and down his chin, dripping on to my shirt collar as I stood paralyzed in front of him.

Before anyone actually reached us, Shepard crumpled to the floor like a discarded marionette, limp and lifeless. The crowd stopped moving, and the room once again became filled with that thick silence.

I followed him to the floor, knelling over him with hot tears welling up in my eyes.

*“Shep - Shep…oh God…oh God.”*

No matter how much I called out to him, no matter how much I shook him, Shep would didn’t wake up. He’d never wake up again, actually.

My eyes darted around the room, but no one was dialing 9-1-1.

*“Phones still work, right?!”* I screamed in disbelief.

*“What the fuck are you all waiting for? He’s having a stroke?!”* I bellowed through my sobs.

No one moved an inch.

*“Fuck all of you, fuck all of you right to hell.”*

My hand moved to pull my cellphone from my back pocket, but somebody caught my wrist from behind and held it tightly in the air.

I assumed it was Barb, so I balled my other hand into a sturdy fist and swung it towards my captor, but it never made contact. Shock and despair caused the punch to dissolve mid-flight.

Lucy was the one who was holding me back.

“*Good job, sweetheart.”* Barb cooed from behind the pulpit.

Still on the floor of the cathedral next to the dying man, my breathing became ragged and my muscles turned into puddy. Flickering candlelight danced over Lucy’s face as I looked into it for answers. Resignation and sorrow marked her expression, but it was clear that she acted calmly and deliberately. Apparently, my wife was more than willing to let Shep perish in an undignified heap on the ground with the whole town watching, a fate that mirrored the stranded leviathan in a way that twisted my stomach into knots.

*“I’m…”* is the only word Lucy vocalized before Barb started delivering commands.

*“Juan, gather the rope from your car so we can restrain Meghan. Trisha, I want you to take Jeremy, Phil, and Weijen out to the 23rd. Ari’s house is the blue ranchero on the corner. Avery, Tom, Martha - could you kindly pull the sheriff’s body out back? The church has a freezer, but there’s still no electricity. We can’t preserve him. Best we can do is an impromptu burial.”*

She then stepped forward from the pulpit slightly to crane her neck around the whiteboard.

*“Looks like the majority of us recall that last instruction to be* ***excavate its jades from their hallowed sockets, and their visions of Apocalypse will cease,*** *so I guess we’ll start there.”*

\-----------

Once the mob tied me to a folding chair, they at least had the decency to place me next to Lucy, up on the stage by the pipe organ. I think they viewed it as decency, at least. In reality, I would have preferred being tossed into the wet dirt next to a possibly still alive Shepard.

Her betrayal had cut so deep.

She tried to justify her actions, but I wasn’t having any of it. This town and its people were Shep’s life, and this is how they chose to repay him. He was there when our basement flooded, lugging water logged furniture onto our lawn in the summer heat. When Lucy’s parents died in a car crash, he sat at our kitchen table and drank coffee with us every day for a month, listening intently and giving advice where he could. When we finally thought IVF worked, only to have it end in a miscarriage, Shep was there to give me a shoulder to cry on. Lucy, perpetually avoidant of discomfort, was off drinking by herself somewhere farther into the mainland.

That was just *our* lives, though. Every person in that church probably had their own collection of stories, iterating Shepard’s wisdom, kindness, and philanthropy. And every single person in that church let him expire on the floor like a mutt. It felt unbelievable, but that was actually the better of the two potential outcomes, too. No one took his pulse as they carried him out of the cathedral, despite my pleas. He might not have died on the church floor. Instead, Shep may have died in a cold pit, mud and soil filling his lungs as he stared helplessly up into the faces of his neighbors as they proceeded to bury him alive.

From their perspective, feeling for a heartbeat was a gamble that had no upside. Barb wanted him in the ground, so he was going into that hole, dead or alive. Why risk confirming that they were sentencing the man to a premature burial?

Dwelling on it made me physically sick.

When I saw a group of them re-entering the church with Ari, his face black and blue from a beating, my anguish turned into something more useful; seething rage.

*“****Does any of this even make any goddamned sense****?”* I screamed, cheeks and chest flushed bright red.

My outburst was abrupt and unexpected. Startled, a few people nearly jumped out of their own skin. Lucy included.

*“I get the insanity of us all being tormented by the prophecy, but I mean, think about it: Ari’s been here for over a week. Its not like everything happened the moment he stepped foot in town. We live on the coast. We’ve had beached whales before, remember?*

*“We’re going to torture and kill a man over a beached whale, a few dumb birds, and some faulty wiring?”*

*“And* ***why*** *would there be these differences in the prophetic instructions? I counted sixteen separate lines listed on that white board. Does* ***anyone*** *have a good way to explain that? For fuck’s sake, what the would be the point?”*

Barb turned to face me, and I swear I saw her chuckle. I think she tried to get a word in edge-wise, but that goddamned chuckle was like throwing a cannister of gasoline into a bonfire.

*“****And Shepard! Fucking Shepard****. He was the sheriff, you fucking lunatics. He wasn’t a king. They aren’t even close to the same position! Barb is forcing a square peg through a circular hole, but you all are so brainwashed that you’re not even thinking about it!”*

*“This isn’t some divine responsibility. This isn’t the universe asking us to be brave in the face of Apocalypse. No, this is…this is something else.”*

Unfortunately, I felt myself losing steam. They had just brought Ari onto the stage. Seeing his wild, fearful eyes and his bloody, swollen mouth up close was diluting my focus.

*“If…if someone can just look at my phone, I have proof. There was…there was a burn…some type of burn on the whale…I mean the Leviathan. There’s…something going on that we don’t completely understand. Shep…oh God, Shep…he drove me over to the boardwalk. We…we saw The Last Great Seer. There was a plug in the back…I think…I think that it could be used like a telephone…”*

Juan, a burly Dominican man who ran the local deli, forcefully pushed the green-eyed harbinger into a folding chair so he was facing me, only a few feet away. Ari peered up at his captor, mumbling pleas of mercy through intermittent sobs. Absentmindedly, the outsider tried to meet Juan’s gaze by swiveling his torso, rather than remaining still as instructed. Ari wasn’t trying to escape, that much was clear. He was trying to make an appeal to his humanity by looking into his eyes.

A set of knuckles careened into his jaw in response to that appeal, releasing the sickening type of crunch that accompanies bone crushing bone.

The young man toppled from the folding chair onto the floor. I watched in horror as Juan, Barb and a few others circled around him like carrion birds flying above fresh road kill. Anytime he moved, the group sent a flurry of kicks into his ribs and abdomen. Once they had tenderized him to the point of near unconsciousness, they dragged his limp body back into the folding chair and secured him with the same rope they had used to secure me.

*“You’re all fucking animals…”* I whispered.

Ari’s head hung motionless, chin to chest. The metallic scent of newly liberated blood drifted through the air like smoke. Even though I was unharmed, I could still almost taste it, wet copper lurching over the tip of my tongue.

*“****You’re all…fucking…animals-****”* my scream muffled by someone behind me stuffing a sock into my mouth.

A barrage of primal shrieks leapt up from my vocal cords, but they barely made any noise through the thick fabric. With both of their prisoners subdued, Barb, Juan and the rest of the group jumped off the stage, discussing preparations for the main event with the crowd of people that was gathering in the aisle.

Slowly, Ari lifted his head to midline. To my confusion, his expression of fear had dissipated, seemingly beaten out of him. He concentrated, perking his ears and moving his eyes from side to side, clearly trying to determine if there was anyone nearby. Satisfied that no one was within earshot, he dragged his eyes forward to meet mine.

They were almost bulging from their sockets. Not with terror. Not with confusion. His jades were agape with frenzy, somehow burning even brighter than Barb’s were.

I felt my thoughts freeze and body overheat like an old radiator as I observed the corners of Ari’s mouth curl upwards.

He smiled at me.

With no one else watching, his lips contorted into a rapturous Cheshire Cat’s grin, violent and uncanny.

Ari tilted his head forward, cloaking everything but his teeth in shadow. Quivering candles illuminated his jaw with a frail spotlight, and I couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by a grim nostalgia.

Just like *The Last Great Seer did* forty years prior, Ari seared a series of apocalyptic words into my consciousness. But these words were new. And unlike the prophecy, these words may have truly been conjured for me alone.

*“Kings can bleed, governments can collapse, and Gods…Gods can fade. These masters can die because they’re artificial. We made them.”*

*“But superstition…superstition is immortal. Its tangled within us, to our very core. It’s undying because it’s hereditary, a ghost in our DNA.”*

*“You can’t kill the inseparable, Meghan.”*

Suddenly, as quickly as it came, the green-eyed harbinger’s grin vanished

With his mask of fear nailed on tight, Ari placed his chin to his chest and waited for deliverance.

\-----------

I find myself unwilling or unable to detail what came next.

Just know that, by the time the town was finished with him, Ari had been thoroughly disassembled.

Until the break of dawn, they worked their way down the white board’s profane list. From what I could tell, the original plan was to only subject Ari to the violent instructions that held a majority from the town’s combined memories.

But bloodletting always begets more bloodletting.

This is the Apocalypse we’re talking about, after all. And they couldn’t be one hundred percent sure which vile act was the key to saving us.

Better safe than sorry, right?

When the sun rose, unaccompanied by conflagration, they patted themselves on the back.

They buried what remained of Ari, if that’s even his real name, in an unmarked grave next to Shepard.

And that’s what hurt me the most.

\-----------

Have you ever heard of a geomagnetic storm?

I sure as shit hadn’t, not until a man claiming to be an environmental services worker called our home the morning after our town enacted the prophecy. They told me they were looking to speak to Shep, that he had called them about a beached whale twenty four hours ago. Now, for whatever reason, they found themselves unable to reach him. They believed they had an explanation for what happened, and they wanted to pass that explanation along.

I won’t pretend like I understand the science of it all, but I can give you all the broad strokes.

Rarely, when the sun emits a wave of energy, known as a solar wind, it can reach earth and disrupt our magnetic fields. Now, stop me if any of these phenomena sound familiar.

Animals like birds, which rely on internal magnetism to guide migration, can become disoriented when magnetic fields are disrupted, grounding themselves until their physiology is restored. In some cases, whales have been known to beach themselves, as they also rely on magnetism for guidance.

Electrical systems can fail, too. Hell, some theorists have speculated that magnetic shifts can cause the formation of a transient Aurora Borelias in places that aren’t normally associated with that type of cosmic occurrence.

At first, I’m wondering why I’m being told all of this. But then, it hits me. Another grim nostalgia.

I’m listening to the hollow, monotoned voice from my childhood. They hid it at first, no doubt wanting to keep me on the line long enough to gloat. As they finished confirming my suspicions that everything our town did was not born of divine purpose, however, they let the masquerade fall.

Once I realized it was them, I hung up. I didn’t need to hear anymore.

\-----------

You might ask yourself, what’s the point? Well, here it is.

I think we were all part of some grand experiment. Someone wanted to prove that they could condition a group of people to commit heinous atrocities without the justification of patriotism, financial incentive, or religious zealotry. They wanted to show that intelligent, well-adjusted members of society could enact hell on earth in pursuit of preventing an Apocalypse, ignoring any contradictory information that may stand in their way. All they needed was a way to manifest apocalyptic conditions at the right time, which, apparently, involved a localized disruption of magnetic fields.

They may have to nudge the circumstances along, of course. Maybe a Leviathan didn’t beach itself as intended, so they sent someone down to electrocute the damn thing, and then they pulled it to shore.

They felt so confident in their hypothesis, in fact, that they said:

*“Hey - I bet these animals will do it even if we give them different instructions on how to do it. That’s how well this going to work.”*

The point is this: our group was just a prototype. A trial run of sorts. I believe we were preparation for a larger, more horrific conditioning event.

So, I’m here to provide a cautionary tale. It’s the least I can do for Shepard.

Look around you. How many of your coworkers, friends, and family members use astrology to guide their actions? We think we’ve evolved beyond myth and superstition, but that’s an outright lie, and the belief hurts us more than it helps us. We need to be vigilant against this type of control.

Don’t believe me?

Pull out your phone, open the application store, and search for the phrase “*The Last Great Seer”.* Should be a new release, listed under astrology or cosmology.

This is my story of Gluttony and Greed (Mild spoilers)","So when I last played, I left off a 270 day run on Voyageur to wait for the last Tale to be released. 7 months later, I jump in to find myself in the Forsaken Airfield with almost no food, no shoes, and no heavy clothes. 

Needless to say, I was confused by this. Surely I had a wolf coat after that long or something, but all I had that was really good was some makeshift crampons, a rabbit hat and tactical gloves... I must've fell on hard times in game. There's some random supplies in the hangar that I left from some other trek here, but nothing too major. Basic tools, a down vest, a rifle. 

so I went through my not-so-extensive notes and found some gems. I'm pretty sure on two or three of these I was drunk, and the one where I found my lost travois? I distinctly remember losing that. I was drunk and the next day I spawned in the MIDDLE of the damn blizzard I got lost in! I nearly lost my run right there. You can skip the bullet points, but I included them because I reference them, and some of them were charming. 

* Day 75 (first note): Left for FM (really helpful, right?)
* Day 115: fishing today. Gonna catch a big one. Might sleep out by the lake tonight-- I'm feelign a little pent up. 
* 150 Made it to Bleak Inlet. Goddamn its cold here. Need to cross this lake to get to the cannery. I’ll need to stock up on fuel on the way so I can weather this shitty weather.
* 163 Found bunker in BI. Haven’t opened the cannery shop yet. I know theres a wolf in there, but I need to make more ammo. I’m running dry. Problem is, going back through there will cost me even more. I’m going to go with a bow next time.
* 195 On my way to the airfield. Going into FM now. Godspeed, Traveller.
* 205 Re-arrived at ZoC. Found the Idle camp had a lot of goodies stached away for safe keeping. Yesterday I also found that travois I lost like 150 days ago. Still had some useful shit in it. I plan on heading to Langston tomorrow with the 4 filters I have on me. I wonder if the lamps I lit are still on… Note: Be careful with revolver ammo. You miss a lot when shooting at wolves, and an unshot wolf only comes back hungrier.
* 226 On the path to Sundered. Left a bunch on the ice bridge.  I must find my way through to Sundered. I hear there are rope climbs, so I have rope available. Worst case, I retreat to hunt a deer then attack again. I WILL summit this mountain. I have ammo. I have clothes. I need to remember to bring as much coal as possible with me.
* 253 Fucking hell that was a cold blizzard. I’ve dragged the most important ccargo I had up to where I entered this region. It was either this route, or the route with the gap back up to where I started. I’m looking for Rudiger’s bunker or safehouse now. I’ve scanned the South and found nothing. I’m afraid its up to the NE. I need to go back to the weather Station for ammo resupply. I set up a cache near the mouth of this western cave. I need to drag as much wood and fire as I can back to the WS so that I can cook some pies. Strawberry out. (It used my real name there). 

* 260 I MISSED SOMETHING. Gotta back up to the high entrance near ambler’s lake. Need to find a polaroid or something. After that I have to return to Omega Bunker wherever that is. FA?
* 254 MAKE PIEZ FOR DAYYZZ

So from this, and very few other notes I had to piece together who I was and what I was doing in the middle of one of the coldest places on earth without shoes on. I at least had my gun, and I looked up where the Omega bunker was so I got myself a buck, ate and went there. That's where the fun begins. 

After finishing the final quest of the series, and not finding any of my missing clothes, I resign myself to hike back to Mystery lake, where I vaguely remember being my main base. In the cave in Forsaken Airfield I find just a stupid amount of cured branches, skins, hatchets, hacksaws, and some broken sewing kits. All the way there, and from that cave to transfer pass I find old campfires every 30 or so feet. What the heck was I doing camping so much? Also, the cave was meticulously spray-painted out with rose hips dotting the way like Pacman bits. Woka Woka. 

When I get back to the depot at Transfer Pass, I found my travois! There were no notes about where I even left it, and it has so. much. shit in it. Like, hoarder shit. 3 hacksaws, 2 flashlights, 171 rosebuds, broken arrows, 6 carrots, enough matches to burn down every individual tree in the area, so many guts... so many... 69 shell casings, enough food to make the trip 8 times over, 3 lanterns, and a plethora of garbage clothing. I've apparently gotten over my hoarding bug since then and drop the clothing and flashlights.

I picked my way through my discovered locations and figured I must've spent a lot of time near the weather station in Sundered, and that note said I had ammo there, so now that I had a shitload of supplies here I figured I could make a quick trip up there and back. That was a mistake, as you can see from note 226.

About 3 days in game later, I'm on my last 2 revolver rounds, stoning chickens to get enough calories to not lose my well-fed bonus, and no flares. I'm nowhere close to getting to the WS or even remembering how to get up there. Even looking at a map doesn't help at first, but I eventually made the right decision to go through the north caves and around the timberwolves that dot the lower plains. By this point, I start to remember why I drank while playing this game because my nerves aren't sitting well. I just go to bed at this point. 

The next day IRL, on low sleep, no water, and barely any food in-game, I summit the weather station and find that I left basically all of the cool clothing I found from the Tales-- the holster, belt, etc.-- along with half a fucking moose, 2 ropes, a pile of burned flares, feathers, and a rifle. Ammo? 10 rounds in total. Coats? None.   
  
Well, at least I got the cool clothes. I head back and mercifully it is easier to get back. I also hit that random cache I mentioned somewhere at the west cave, and found another obscene pile of flares. Despite now having enough flares to scare off half of the fucking region's wolves, I do not encounter a single one now. Of course. 

I get back to my travois in Transfer Pass and think ""Hey, I have all this stamina why should I go to bed now?"" Old me would've known better, but he was also the psycho who hoarded burnt flares and guts, so I take off. I encounter a wolf, and I shoot at it with one of my flare guns. It runs off, only to rush me again and maul me a bit. Dope. Going lethal next time. Oh, and another confusing number of campfires on the way. Like, 10 of them. 

I do the travois shuffle for 2 days in the Rangeline, get to that warehouse in Broken Railroad and repeat of the last several places. An obscene amount of guts and just randomness. 5 car batteries are here. Why are there fishing supplies in here of all places? Okay. 

Welp, my travois is packed, so I just leave, thinking I could make it to the railcar before I run out of stamina. Nope. Instead? I am pulling 75 keys of junk across the muskeg in the dark with a big red eye in the bottom of my screen in a blizzard. Of all things I have, coffee is not fucking one of them. 

Ahead I see a figure. I shoot. I realize to my horror that it's a fucking bear, but it thankfully runs away. Then it comes back for round two, or so I thought. I gun it down with the last of my rifle ammo a short way from the railcar. The next morning I go out to grab some of its meat, and see not one, but TWO dead bears, both fresh. I somehow got attacked by two bears that night and the other decided to bleed out nearby on the tracks... so I thank my lucky stars, skin and quarter them both and stack 40 keys of meat in the rail car to be eaten by probably nobody ever. 

I get some rest, and haul my now 45kg character with his 75 kg travois back to Mystery Lake without incident to get to the Office... I find another travois there. It is packed to the brim with shit. I go inside, and every surface is covered in either dead animal bits, flares, crowbars, piles of shit clothing, piles of rotten fish, or occasionally, something like a sewing kit. 

I have all these fucking skins, mind you, and only a moose hide satchel and a rabbit hat to show for it. Every container is filled, and now I have to go find some Woodworker's tools in order to craft more storage for all my shit. I don't even have enough storage space to offload my character, so I just start another pile of random bullshit by the back door with the other pile of bullshit. Remember all of those campfires I saw? I think I travois-hauled half the fucking Far Territories map back to this office. 

I have no clue what happened to the wolfskin coat that I'm sure I made, or the deerskin pants, or whatever high-tier boots I must've had at some point, and at this point, I never will. At least I found some old trail boots along the way.

*“A curtain of night under a bejeweled sky.”*

In a flash, I remembered Lucy was under the same sky. But not with me.

She was with Barb.

I wrenched my phone out of my pocket; the heavens tinting the screen ghostly, neon colors as I saw what I ignored while searching for *The Last Great Seer.*

4 missed calls from Lucy, followed by a text message and a picture.

*“Barb gathered nearly everyone at the chapel, except Ari. Practically everyone in town was tormented by the prophecy when they were young. They’re all acting crazy. What they’re talking about doing is insane. Come ASAP and bring Shep.”*

Although none of us are religious, we use an abandoned Pentecostal church as our town hall. It’s the biggest communal space we have.

The picture was hazy and out of focus, which I took to mean that Lucy had taken it in secret. There was a white board next to the pulpit, which was covered in things like:

***-Excavate its jades from their hallowed sockets, and their visions of Apocalypse will cease. ?Remove eyes. (5 Tally marks next to it)***

***-Excise the bull’s manhood, and Apocalypse will fall. ?Castration (2 Tally marks)***

***-Flay its carapace, and Apocalypse will be exposed. ?Skinning (4 Tally marks)***

The list went on and on.

Standing at the pulpit, I could clearly see Barb, eyes burning with frenzy, hands gesturing wildly toward the pews.

\------------

*“Barbara…you need to stand down,”* Shep growled, his words echoing up into the rafters of the vast cathedral.

Hundreds of bodies turned in the pews to face the sheriff as he and I entered. There had been lively chatter when we first walked in, with the entire town debating the most appropriate violence to inflict on Ari, our green-eyed harbinger. Now, there was only silence. A thick, suffocating quiet, made dense by the thousands of words that lingered impatiently on people’s tongues but remained unsaid.

I peered around from behind Shepard, trying to locate my wife in the frozen mob. As my eyes moved up the length of the church, I eventually found her. Ahead of the pews, there was a raised area with a pulpit and an altar. A rusty pipe organ mounted against the back wall framed the stage, with its dilapidated metal cylinders curving around the pulpit like the tendrils of a kraken twisting around the hull of a ship.

Lucy was sitting on the bench in front of the organ, deeply sequestered behind rows of townspeople and Barbara, who stood in front of the pulpit, head shaking with divine indignation like a magistrate looking upon a convicted witch at Salem.

*“Shepard, what right do you have to overthrow the will of the people? You work for us, not the other way around,”* she boomed from the safety of her podium.

Murmurs of agreement radiated throughout the crowd. Barb had clearly persuaded them, but they hadn’t completely succumbed to frenzy.

Not yet, at least.

*“Open your eyes, sheriff. That whale died on our shore. The birds aren’t flying. The town lacks electricity, and a strange light pervades the sky. All on the same day, all after Ari’s arrival. Do you think we enjoy convening by candlelight? Do you truly believe our pain had no purpose?”*

To my astonishment, I found myself agreeing with Barb. A peculiar relief poured over me as I listened. Involuntarily, I swallowed and nodded my head.

Shep turned and shot me a look of pure disgust, having sensed my wavering allegiance. As much as I treasured his respect, and as much as I knew what we were considering was morally unconscionable, I couldn’t help but find comfort in Barb’s narrative. We had all suffered at the feet of this prophecy, and we had endured that suffering alone - until today. The warmth that came from a room full of people that understood felt like morphine in my blood.

*“Alright folks, let make this all abundantly clear for you.”*

The sheriff walked forward onto the carpeted aisle as he spoke, leaving me and my smoldering collusion behind.

*“I do not deny your pain. Nor am I saying that I understand what’s happening here today. I don’t think anyone has a good explanation for what all of that is.”*

He beckoned out one of the cathedral’s tall windows at the blankets of blue-green light swimming ominously through the night sky. But there was something else on the glass that he didn’t call our attention to. Something that caused the hairs on the nape of my neck to stand on end.

Tiny beads of dripping liquid, absorbing and refracting the cosmic light as they painted long lines down the window. Every tempest starts as a drizzle of rain.

I started pacing forward to grab Shep, knowing what could be next to follow.

*“I wish I understood your pain, and I wish I understood what you experienced, truly, I do,”* he continued.

*“But here’s something I do understand. It’s simple, and it’s universally applicable: ‘Thou shalt not kill’. The activities y’all have listed up on that whiteboard - castration, skinning, hobbling, amputating, blinding - they’ll kill that poor man. And he won’t pass on quietly, neither. So, ask yourselves: something is demanding y’all do those things to Ari, but is it worth giving up your humanity to do it? I know the prophecy says a lake of fire will eat the world if you don’t hurt him, but I mean, if you become demons to save us, did you really avoid creating hell?”*

When I reached him, he was nearly at the pulpit, looking up to meet Barb’s burning gaze. Wind whipped against the church’s rickety woodwork, causing the walls to seemingly buckle and expand with the current. Hefty droplets of rainfall crashed against the rooftop like the hooves of a stampede. I grabbed his forearm and pulled myself up to my tiptoes so my whispers could meet his ear.

*“I know you don’t believe this is happening, but we need to go. The next part of the prophecy is ‘the death of a king amidst a sweeping Tempest. We haven’t had a mayor in over a decade, so you’re the closest thing this town has to a king.”*

Barb’s voice cut through the sounds of the storm like a crack of thunder.

*“Meghan! Are you conspiring with the Sheriff? Are the both of you planning on standing in the way of what needs to be done?”*

People rose from the pews, staring daggers into Shep and I. At first, it was just a handful. But the more venom Barb spewed, the more of our neighbors answered her call.

*“They have chosen us! The universe, in its infinite wisdom, has selected us to prevent Apocalypse. Would you really deprive of us of our destiny and damn the world to conflagration, all just to protect a man who you hardly even know? An outsider, no less?”*

A crowd gathered in the aisle, preventing our only escape route. I swung my head from side to side, looking for an opening, a hole in the mob that Shep and I might be able to squeeze through, but I found nothing.

With the people closing in on us, I turned to face the sheriff, who had become eerily motionless in the preceding few seconds. When I saw his expression, my heart transformed from meat into lead and it plummeted through the bottom of my chest.

His eyes were empty and glazed over, like marbles painted to resemble human eyes. The left half of his face sagged unnaturally downward, making it look like those features were being subjected to a different, more potent force of gravity than his right. A stream of dribble fell from the corner of his mouth and down his chin, dripping on to my shirt collar as I stood paralyzed in front of him.

Before anyone actually reached us, Shepard crumpled to the floor like a discarded marionette, limp and lifeless. The crowd stopped moving, and the room once again became filled with that thick silence.

I followed him to the floor, knelling over him with hot tears welling up in my eyes.

*“Shep - Shep…oh God…oh God.”*

No matter how much I called out to him, no matter how much I shook him, Shep would didn’t wake up. He’d never wake up again, actually.

My eyes darted around the room, but no one was dialing 9-1-1.

*“Phones still work, right?!”* I screamed in disbelief.

*“What the fuck are you all waiting for? He’s having a stroke?!”* I bellowed through my sobs.

No one moved an inch.

*“Fuck all of you, fuck all of you right to hell.”*

My hand moved to pull my cellphone from my back pocket, but somebody caught my wrist from behind and held it tightly in the air.

I assumed it was Barb, so I balled my other hand into a sturdy fist and swung it towards my captor, but it never made contact. Shock and despair caused the punch to dissolve mid-flight.

Lucy was the one who was holding me back.

“*Good job, sweetheart.”* Barb cooed from behind the pulpit.

Still on the floor of the cathedral next to the dying man, my breathing became ragged and my muscles turned into puddy. Flickering candlelight danced over Lucy’s face as I looked into it for answers. Resignation and sorrow marked her expression, but it was clear that she acted calmly and deliberately. Apparently, my wife was more than willing to let Shep perish in an undignified heap on the ground with the whole town watching, a fate that mirrored the stranded leviathan in a way that twisted my stomach into knots.

*“I’m…”* is the only word Lucy vocalized before Barb started delivering commands.

*“Juan, gather the rope from your car so we can restrain Meghan. Trisha, I want you to take Jeremy, Phil, and Weijen out to the 23rd. Ari’s house is the blue ranchero on the corner. Avery, Tom, Martha - could you kindly pull the sheriff’s body out back? The church has a freezer, but there’s still no electricity. We can’t preserve him. Best we can do is an impromptu burial.”*

She then stepped forward from the pulpit slightly to crane her neck around the whiteboard.

*“Looks like the majority of us recall that last instruction to be* ***excavate its jades from their hallowed sockets, and their visions of Apocalypse will cease,*** *so I guess we’ll start there.”*

\-----------

Once the mob tied me to a folding chair, they at least had the decency to place me next to Lucy, up on the stage by the pipe organ. I think they viewed it as decency, at least. In reality, I would have preferred being tossed into the wet dirt next to a possibly still alive Shepard.

Her betrayal had cut so deep.

She tried to justify her actions, but I wasn’t having any of it. This town and its people were Shep’s life, and this is how they chose to repay him. He was there when our basement flooded, lugging water logged furniture onto our lawn in the summer heat. When Lucy’s parents died in a car crash, he sat at our kitchen table and drank coffee with us every day for a month, listening intently and giving advice where he could. When we finally thought IVF worked, only to have it end in a miscarriage, Shep was there to give me a shoulder to cry on. Lucy, perpetually avoidant of discomfort, was off drinking by herself somewhere farther into the mainland.

That was just *our* lives, though. Every person in that church probably had their own collection of stories, iterating Shepard’s wisdom, kindness, and philanthropy. And every single person in that church let him expire on the floor like a mutt. It felt unbelievable, but that was actually the better of the two potential outcomes, too. No one took his pulse as they carried him out of the cathedral, despite my pleas. He might not have died on the church floor. Instead, Shep may have died in a cold pit, mud and soil filling his lungs as he stared helplessly up into the faces of his neighbors as they proceeded to bury him alive.

From their perspective, feeling for a heartbeat was a gamble that had no upside. Barb wanted him in the ground, so he was going into that hole, dead or alive. Why risk confirming that they were sentencing the man to a premature burial?

Dwelling on it made me physically sick.

When I saw a group of them re-entering the church with Ari, his face black and blue from a beating, my anguish turned into something more useful; seething rage.

*“****Does any of this even make any goddamned sense****?”* I screamed, cheeks and chest flushed bright red.

My outburst was abrupt and unexpected. Startled, a few people nearly jumped out of their own skin. Lucy included.

*“I get the insanity of us all being tormented by the prophecy, but I mean, think about it: Ari’s been here for over a week. Its not like everything happened the moment he stepped foot in town. We live on the coast. We’ve had beached whales before, remember?*

*“We’re going to torture and kill a man over a beached whale, a few dumb birds, and some faulty wiring?”*

*“And* ***why*** *would there be these differences in the prophetic instructions? I counted sixteen separate lines listed on that white board. Does* ***anyone*** *have a good way to explain that? For fuck’s sake, what the would be the point?”*

Barb turned to face me, and I swear I saw her chuckle. I think she tried to get a word in edge-wise, but that goddamned chuckle was like throwing a cannister of gasoline into a bonfire.

*“****And Shepard! Fucking Shepard****. He was the sheriff, you fucking lunatics. He wasn’t a king. They aren’t even close to the same position! Barb is forcing a square peg through a circular hole, but you all are so brainwashed that you’re not even thinking about it!”*

*“This isn’t some divine responsibility. This isn’t the universe asking us to be brave in the face of Apocalypse. No, this is…this is something else.”*

Unfortunately, I felt myself losing steam. They had just brought Ari onto the stage. Seeing his wild, fearful eyes and his bloody, swollen mouth up close was diluting my focus.

*“If…if someone can just look at my phone, I have proof. There was…there was a burn…some type of burn on the whale…I mean the Leviathan. There’s…something going on that we don’t completely understand. Shep…oh God, Shep…he drove me over to the boardwalk. We…we saw The Last Great Seer. There was a plug in the back…I think…I think that it could be used like a telephone…”*

Juan, a burly Dominican man who ran the local deli, forcefully pushed the green-eyed harbinger into a folding chair so he was facing me, only a few feet away. Ari peered up at his captor, mumbling pleas of mercy through intermittent sobs. Absentmindedly, the outsider tried to meet Juan’s gaze by swiveling his torso, rather than remaining still as instructed. Ari wasn’t trying to escape, that much was clear. He was trying to make an appeal to his humanity by looking into his eyes.

A set of knuckles careened into his jaw in response to that appeal, releasing the sickening type of crunch that accompanies bone crushing bone.

The young man toppled from the folding chair onto the floor. I watched in horror as Juan, Barb and a few others circled around him like carrion birds flying above fresh road kill. Anytime he moved, the group sent a flurry of kicks into his ribs and abdomen. Once they had tenderized him to the point of near unconsciousness, they dragged his limp body back into the folding chair and secured him with the same rope they had used to secure me.

*“You’re all fucking animals…”* I whispered.

Ari’s head hung motionless, chin to chest. The metallic scent of newly liberated blood drifted through the air like smoke. Even though I was unharmed, I could still almost taste it, wet copper lurching over the tip of my tongue.

*“****You’re all…fucking…animals-****”* my scream muffled by someone behind me stuffing a sock into my mouth.

A barrage of primal shrieks leapt up from my vocal cords, but they barely made any noise through the thick fabric. With both of their prisoners subdued, Barb, Juan and the rest of the group jumped off the stage, discussing preparations for the main event with the crowd of people that was gathering in the aisle.

Slowly, Ari lifted his head to midline. To my confusion, his expression of fear had dissipated, seemingly beaten out of him. He concentrated, perking his ears and moving his eyes from side to side, clearly trying to determine if there was anyone nearby. Satisfied that no one was within earshot, he dragged his eyes forward to meet mine.

They were almost bulging from their sockets. Not with terror. Not with confusion. His jades were agape with frenzy, somehow burning even brighter than Barb’s were.

I felt my thoughts freeze and body overheat like an old radiator as I observed the corners of Ari’s mouth curl upwards.

He smiled at me.

With no one else watching, his lips contorted into a rapturous Cheshire Cat’s grin, violent and uncanny.

Ari tilted his head forward, cloaking everything but his teeth in shadow. Quivering candles illuminated his jaw with a frail spotlight, and I couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by a grim nostalgia.

Just like *The Last Great Seer did* forty years prior, Ari seared a series of apocalyptic words into my consciousness. But these words were new. And unlike the prophecy, these words may have truly been conjured for me alone.

*“Kings can bleed, governments can collapse, and Gods…Gods can fade. These masters can die because they’re artificial. We made them.”*

*“But superstition…superstition is immortal. Its tangled within us, to our very core. It’s undying because it’s hereditary, a ghost in our DNA.”*

*“You can’t kill the inseparable, Meghan.”*

Suddenly, as quickly as it came, the green-eyed harbinger’s grin vanished

With his mask of fear nailed on tight, Ari placed his chin to his chest and waited for deliverance.

\-----------

I find myself unwilling or unable to detail what came next.

Just know that, by the time the town was finished with him, Ari had been thoroughly disassembled.

Until the break of dawn, they worked their way down the white board’s profane list. From what I could tell, the original plan was to only subject Ari to the violent instructions that held a majority from the town’s combined memories.

But bloodletting always begets more bloodletting.

This is the Apocalypse we’re talking about, after all. And they couldn’t be one hundred percent sure which vile act was the key to saving us.

Better safe than sorry, right?

When the sun rose, unaccompanied by conflagration, they patted themselves on the back.

They buried what remained of Ari, if that’s even his real name, in an unmarked grave next to Shepard.

And that’s what hurt me the most.

\-----------

Have you ever heard of a geomagnetic storm?

I sure as shit hadn’t, not until a man claiming to be an environmental services worker called our home the morning after our town enacted the prophecy. They told me they were looking to speak to Shep, that he had called them about a beached whale twenty four hours ago. Now, for whatever reason, they found themselves unable to reach him. They believed they had an explanation for what happened, and they wanted to pass that explanation along.

I won’t pretend like I understand the science of it all, but I can give you all the broad strokes.

Rarely, when the sun emits a wave of energy, known as a solar wind, it can reach earth and disrupt our magnetic fields. Now, stop me if any of these phenomena sound familiar.

Animals like birds, which rely on internal magnetism to guide migration, can become disoriented when magnetic fields are disrupted, grounding themselves until their physiology is restored. In some cases, whales have been known to beach themselves, as they also rely on magnetism for guidance.

Electrical systems can fail, too. Hell, some theorists have speculated that magnetic shifts can cause the formation of a transient Aurora Borelias in places that aren’t normally associated with that type of cosmic occurrence.

At first, I’m wondering why I’m being told all of this. But then, it hits me. Another grim nostalgia.

I’m listening to the hollow, monotoned voice from my childhood. They hid it at first, no doubt wanting to keep me on the line long enough to gloat. As they finished confirming my suspicions that everything our town did was not born of divine purpose, however, they let the masquerade fall.

Once I realized it was them, I hung up. I didn’t need to hear anymore.

\-----------

You might ask yourself, what’s the point? Well, here it is.

I think we were all part of some grand experiment. Someone wanted to prove that they could condition a group of people to commit heinous atrocities without the justification of patriotism, financial incentive, or religious zealotry. They wanted to show that intelligent, well-adjusted members of society could enact hell on earth in pursuit of preventing an Apocalypse, ignoring any contradictory information that may stand in their way. All they needed was a way to manifest apocalyptic conditions at the right time, which, apparently, involved a localized disruption of magnetic fields.

They may have to nudge the circumstances along, of course. Maybe a Leviathan didn’t beach itself as intended, so they sent someone down to electrocute the damn thing, and then they pulled it to shore.

They felt so confident in their hypothesis, in fact, that they said:

*“Hey - I bet these animals will do it even if we give them different instructions on how to do it. That’s how well this going to work.”*

The point is this: our group was just a prototype. A trial run of sorts. I believe we were preparation for a larger, more horrific conditioning event.

So, I’m here to provide a cautionary tale. It’s the least I can do for Shepard.

Look around you. How many of your coworkers, friends, and family members use astrology to guide their actions? We think we’ve evolved beyond myth and superstition, but that’s an outright lie, and the belief hurts us more than it helps us. We need to be vigilant against this type of control. 

Don’t believe me?

Pull out your phone, open the application store, and search for the phrase “*The Last Great Seer”.* Should be a new release, listed under astrology or cosmology.

Here are my thoughts so far!

Dak Big Apple: I tried this first as I’ve never had a co-ferment before and I was super curious what the balance between natural coffee flavors and apple flavors would be. Ultimately this tasted crazily like apples, like WAY more than I would have expected. I don’t feel like ranking this alongside coffee because I think I lean this should be its own category. Don’t get me wrong, it was legit delicious. My wife said it smelled like a decaying person but she’s a hater

Dak Lemon Pearls: The second coffee I tried. I figured after I had the funky co-ferment I should go for something more directly up my alley. This one didn’t disappoint! Flavor notes are spot on, this one is super clean and lemony in a super pleasant way. Tempted to pick up a full bag.

Dak Rumba: Only disappointment so far, this one has that classic natural processed fermenty smell but felt like it was missing anything beyond that in the cup. Could be that I didn’t brew this one the best but that’s just the rotation gamble baby!

Dak Sweet Dreams: Yeah I have no idea what to say about this one. This one did indeed smell naaassty when I brewed it, but the flavor was more honeyed and complex than the big apple. I don’t actually really know where to put this but I think it definitely falls into the Co-ferment bucket a notch or two above big apple. Super interesting experience!

It certainly seems like I may have done it again, startinf a few days ago? Timeline for drinking hot coffee lines up (im nor a daily coffee peraon) but this time however I am concerned after a few days of blood after brushing teeth. I'm especially nervous because of where the gum meets the teeth. It looks unhealthy and like I may have a bacterial infection of the gums, no?

I've been using the ""lick test"" to figure out if I have bad breath because im equally anxious about that, but I can't even trust my own observations with other ENT stuff due to my anxiety/hypochondria, i.e. I cant tell the difference here between normal mouthy/breathy smell and ""bad breath"" on myself. (The least I can say is i don't smell that septic-esque smell that some people with chronic dental bacteria have, I think that one is halitosis... unless I do smell like that?)

Additional context is ive been brushing and flossing with a bit more vigor since noticing, so perhaps those are physical abrasions, unless it looks clearly like gingivitis/gum disease to some of you.

I have the usual dc and small stuff nothing exotic.

I want to start off by saying I haven’t spoken to my brother in more than 2 years. I haven’t spoken to his wife in more than 9. Fun times. Let’s start at the very beginning, it’s a very good place to start and will also be making this post much longer than your average post.

The year is somewhere in the late 2000’s. I have “menopause brain”. Don’t come for me.  In a country Far Far away from the US in a small agricultural town where everyone knows basically everyone. If you don’t know what you’re doing, your neighbor certainly does. Pete (35m) is the oldest of 3 kids and by no means does this make him the smartest of the bunch. Rick (33m) is the second born. A reserved and quiet guy and extremely non-confrontational. He was also the first to get married. (That is a whole different kettle of fish & a very long story that would make Stephen King jealous ((I love you Stephen King!!))…) Lastly, yours truly, Beth (25f). A rambunctious, outspoken girl with a no-nonsense attitude thanks to years of being bullied by her bros.

Pete got married the year before. Timeless Tradition ensured that his fiancé (Eleanor 29f) couldn’t move in unless they were married. So, they did a small ceremony, got hitched and are living together. A year later they started planning what we lovingly refer to as “the Circus”. The Circus consisted of a renewing of vows in the family church and a reception after.  

Due to the nature of the beast (Eleanor), we had our ups and downs. She was what we would call “From the Wrong side of the Train Tracks”. Basic manners, etiquette and common decency had escaped her *Illustrious Education*. Think Catch me outside girl.  Before the Circus she decided a family gathering is the best place to spew profanities at myself, my mum and another family member. I took my mum and left.

Later that day Pete decided he would confront us too. Slamming his fists on the table and screaming at us that we need to respect his wife. Like dude, she was the one going off, we kept quiet! I walked out before I said anything I couldn’t take back. Eleanor reached out and we met at a coffee shop. I was hoping that this would prevent her from acting like a backwoods inbred bitch. It didn’t. She has no tact, no sense of how to behave.

The Bachelorette – Oh! Oh! Pete said we had to invite OUR friends as Eleanor had none. Might be a Red Flag, my Dude, wouldn’t you say???? My mum and I invited a few family members and hoped that that would suffice. But when the deuce hit the wind turbine, we cancelled the bachelorette and drank the night away! Don’t bite the hand.

So off to the Circus we went. I got drunk and had a merry Ol’ time! I looked happier than the bride and had way more fun than she would’ve liked. I also rocked my speech.

A bit later I got married and ensured that Pete and Eleanor had no part to play in my wedding whatsoever. Rick made the sibling speech, and it was wonderful! Our first Christmas with all 3 kids being married was coming up. We decided to go to the Beach House with our parents as one big Happy Family. Hindsight, am I right?

Pete and Eleanor went out for a drive into town, they left their new hatched spawn with Grandma & Grandpa. They were gone for quite a while. So much so that the rest of the family are preparing dinner and they’re still not back. With tires screeching and obscenities yelled by both parties they returned. Eleanor turned her sights on the 2 lovely old people who cared for her semen-demon. Attacking them verbally saying what horrible people they are for raising such awful children. You bloody hick, I’m one of those children that you are spewing acid about! Pete wanted to get back, told her to get in the car or he was leaving without her. That’s what started their fight. In the car she decided to yank on the steering wheel and nearly caused them to get into an accident.

Later that same year Eleanor attacked Pete with a knife and stabbed him in the arm.

Let’s skip a few years as her behavior tracked the same. My husband and I moved to the town I grew up in. So now I’m considerably closer geographically to the ~~problem~~ woman. We moved into an old house, so many things needed an upgrade. We saved and made some changes, to which Eleanor was irate that she didn’t “get money” to make the same upgrades to their house. Keeping up with the Jones’s was taking over her whole life. It was miserable. We kept them away for as long as possible, but people made small talk, and she found out. Another wave of profanities.

We had our first child. A prefect little blessing. I would visit my parents almost every day after work so they can spend time with our baby. As the kids grew older, Eleanor brought over some uniforms for me to alter. In the country I was raised in, you are not allowed to alter any government uniforms. In fact, if they are too big or small, they MUST be returned. I took the “clothes for the kids to wear” in a shopping bag and realized exactly what they were after she left. I took the bag back and left it on her porch and sent her a message saying as much. I could go to prison for having had them in my home! Nuh uh!

My husband received what we thought was an offer on a dream job, so we moved away from our little town. We still went there some weekends to visit my parents. The job ended up being anything but. We knew almost immediately that the move and job was a mistake. So, we held out for a year and started planning our immigration to the States. 

As our time came to a close before we boarded the plane for a New Life, Eleanor decided to stir. And Stir she did! She sent voice notes and text messages accusing me of Stealing her uniforms! She insisted that I never returned them. In the voice notes and text messages she admitted that she brought them to my house to have them altered so that the kids can wear them and play Cops & Robbers and whatnot. I called the detachment closest to us and asked a few questions as to what my rights would be in a “hypothetical situation”.  The sergeant made it quite clear that Eleanor would be the one going to Prison, not me, and seeing as I have her messages, I have evidence to back me up.  My mind was put at ease, although this sergeant wanted more info, I decided that any involvement would delay our exodus.

Hopscotch to 2020-ish. Time is a construct. What would I know

We are living in the States, by no means are we well off. Paycheck to paycheck and just praying things would get easier. I got a call from Pete. They want to move here. FML, really??? I was quite curt in my reply that I will Not be helping them and will do my utmost best to have his wife locked up as soon as she sets foot in the US. Try me Bro. Your wife can’t speak English to save her life anyway and I owe you jack shit. Nada.

As it goes with kids who move far away, we might be on the other side of the globe, but the stories still make their way to us. One such story is that Eleanor decided to spew profanities at my Dad and insult him whilst he was driving them back from Pete’s surgery. Dad kept quiet but obviously wanted nothing more than to pull over and leave her on the side of the highway.  Kudos to him, I would’ve pulled over and kicked the Hagg out!

A little while later Eleanor lost a parent. The fallout from that was another screaming match at my folks for apparently “pretending to care”. Right there in the street. Insults and accusations galore and my parents took it until my mum had had enough. They apologized and left as not to be further pummeled by her verbal attack.

A Vacation to remember.

We finally saved up enough money to go visit our families that we haven’t seen in YEARS!! We spent time with my in-laws and with my family. For Christmas we were to be with my parents. I asked that this be MY Christmas where I can decide who will sit at the banquet table and enjoy the feast. My parents agreed.

Queue the drama. Pete called and said he wanted to chat. We should go for coffee on Christmas Eve! Seriously?! Why?!? But, ok fine, whatever. He came right out with his version of the events that transpired while we were making a life for ourselves abroad. Strange that he made it sound like him and Eleanor are the victims. Just spewing utter hogwash for a good 45 minutes. I sat there and listened… and listened. I had enough. My turn.

I noted 3 things. 1. In our family home we Never raised our voices to our parents, anyone who did, was out and there were consequences. 2. I have been threatened with prison because of his wife’s own stupidity and arrogance. 3. He hasn’t answered any of my texts in the last year. All of these culminate in “Eat Shit”.

I brought outfits for everyone at Christmas. Dresses for the ladies and shirts for the men. We all looked so darn Festive!! We took a pic of my husband, myself and the kids. I sent out a mass text wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and thought nothing of it as we feasted and enjoyed the day.

The next morning, I woke up to a few messages from Pete. A sarcastic “I hope you enjoyed your day. My kids have been crying because their auntie thinks they aren’t good enough.” Geez dude, how would your kids come to that conclusion? On their own???

“Who gave you the right to decide to exclude me and my family on Christmas? I hope you feel awesome about that. All of us have been crying the whole day, the whole weekend. Thanks for the coffee yesterday, but that’s the last time I will talk to you, about Anything. My wife isn’t perfect, but she is MY WIFE and the mother to my kids. You sit over there in the States knowing nothing about what we are going through. I literally sat and begged for a relationship with our parents, for visits and love. Now you’re just dancing to the tune mum played you with and in doing so you are hurting my family’s hearts.”

“You leave a wreck in your wake sister. Good luck and merry Christmas. Peace be with you”

I was typing furiously for about 20 minutes when I realized I don’t need to play this game, like at all.

My reply: Righto. Actions have consequences. Now you’re all heartbroken and mad at me over my actions and non-actions. She threatened me and you ignored me. I’m not the bad guy here.

Him: Go look in the mirror.

Me:

So AITAH if I keep the status quo and ensure that both of them never contact me or my family again?

It's cold in Old Frost Peak. I just got off the plane and am surprised by how cold it is. It's nighttime when I get off the plane. I walked to a parked pick-up truck with snow tires and jumped in the passenger seat. My friend James convinces me to stop for a bite to eat at a diner on the way to Stone Bliss. The town of Stone Bliss has less than forty people living in it but with the new oil pipeline being built in town the number of people in town will soon balloon to one hundred. Stopping to eat, James and I stopped at a little diner called Big Mamas. Inside the owner, a Heavy sit Black woman named Big Mama came out of the kitchen to greet us. She sat us down at a small table for two and passed me a menu. I was amazed that this place was open at this time of night, but James tells me Big Mama's is open 24/7 so we wait for our food and keep talking. Once the food arrives it is as delicious as James said it would be. I’ve known James since high school, he's always been a good friend. After high school instead of going to college, I worked odd jobs and James moved to Old Frost Peak, but we never lost touch. After eating we jumped back in James’ pick-up truck and headed into town. The town is small, but the company has put all its employees up in a fancy hotel one town over James just wanted me to see the town before we head over to the hotel.

 

On the main street, James and I meet Ms. Rose, the local bar owner. We stopped for a few beers and met a few other townspeople. Lisa the waitress was more than a little friendly with James and I got to meet Matt, my new boss. I was told the work would start in three weeks and we were the first to arrive for the job. Matt bought a couple of rounds at the bar then everyone headed home. Outside the bar, I stop and talk with Matt. He tells me that there's a house for some of the employees for the overflow employees. Matt offers me some money if I agree to clean it up, he knows I need the money and is doing me a favor. I tell Matt I'll be there first thing in the morning, and I head back to James. Once I'm back James drives off and takes me to the hotel. At the hotel, we each check into our rooms and get to sleep in the morning I wake up James so he can drive me to the shore house. The house is an hour away from town and its closer to the worksite. It's there I spent the next three hours James said he'd pick me up at six it’s now midnight, so I have a long wait. Its summer now so I don't have to worry about snowstorms or at least I shouldn't but the clouds are dark and the ocean is restless. As it starts to snow, I take in the sight of falling snow.

 

An hour passes and the snow starts to fall heavier. I shut the windows and waited out the storm. I know I'll probably be spending the night here, so I pick a bed and try to sleep when there's no power in the house, but I make the most of it. All night I toss and turn while the storm rages on. The wind howls and smacks the windows, at midnight I get up to make myself something to eat. Luckily for me the fridge is stocked with food. A loud bang on the door gets my attention. I checked the back door and saw a rock with a note tied to it. I quickly shut the door to keep the snow out. Unwrapping the note from the rock I am surprised by the strange glyphs. The ink seems to be some kind of gold, but it can't be real gold. I hold the note to the light, and it shines. Putting the note away, I head back to bed for the rest of the night. I can't help feeling strange about that note, but I try to put it out of my mind. In the morning, it snowed close to four feet sticking out of the snow is a human hand. I rush to the hand and pull it out of the snow, it’s a woman she's beautiful her long black hair with a small braid in the front. I pull her out of the snow she is freezing. I ran into the house for a blanket and wrapped her up in it and carried her into the house.

 

Something is strange about this woman she is naked from the neck down exposing her perky breasts beside her breasts I see slits four of them on each side. They look like fish gills, but they can't be, I put a few logs on the fire and wait for her to wake up some part of me wants to call a doctor but there's no service for my phone. All I can do is wait, it takes an hour for her to wake up, she looks around for something she'd lost. It might still be in the snow I say but she says nothing. For some reason she doesn’t get up from the couch. I don’t remember checking her legs for injury, so I lift the blanket and check them. The sight I take in shocks me, and I fall back without saying a word. I pull the blanket off her and gaze at her fish legs. She’s a mermaid. Around her neck, she wears shark tooth necklaces, and, on her tail, there are more of these glyphs carved into her skin. She seems to be able to breathe the air I head to the garage to check on the generator and the power. The mermaid is quiet, she just looks at me and doesn't say a word. I try to bring her some food, but she won't eat, all she does is stare at me. I know there's something wrong with her, but I just can't put my finger on it. I put the blanket back on her and she grabs my arm. With her holding on so tightly I can barely breathe it's as if she is choking the life out of me through my arm.

 

In my mind I can see visions of schools of Mer people swimming deep in the ocean using bone spears, the Mer people have villages under water and marry each other in wonderful ceremonies where they pray to a sea god. All the men and women wear necklaces of gold and shark teeth which seem to be of higher value than the gold necklaces. Once the merwoman lets go I fall to the ground and pass out. I wake up and it's morning the sun is out and the merwoman is looking dried up, so I move her to the bathtub. Turning on the water I head back to the living room and turn on the tv. That's when a knock on the door gets my attention. Its James, he's come to pick me up, I told James I plan to stay a few more days and apologize for not calling him. He tells me with this weather any call I made wouldn't have gone through anyway. James checks the fridge and says he'll be back tomorrow with some more gas and food for me. We say our goodbyes and I head back upstairs to check on the merwoman. She looks much better after soaking for a few hours. I run my hand in the water, and it is cool to the touch. I also touch her fish scale's lightly with my fingers she seems to enjoy my touch. She lightly brushes my hair and pulls me in close to her.

 

Once our faces touch, we kiss a long and passionate kiss. I rub her breasts, and she rolls her tongue in my mouth as we kiss. The next few days are long and lustful but eventually, she uses her telepathy to tell me about its time for her to return to the water. With the shore house getting its first guest the day after tomorrow I knew our time together would be ending soon. So, I put on my coat my warmest gloves and carried her to the beach. Carrying her to the water I placed one last kiss on her mouth before letting her swim away. After that, I take a long shower and call James to pick me up. The hotel is out of this world, the outside is black as night, the walls inside are a mixture of purple and black swirls, pictures of butterflies and gardens on the ceiling, the dim lighting all seem to come together quite well. I walk to the elevators with James after checking in at the front desk and James will be staying on the same floor. We both get off on the fifth floor and head to opposite sides of the hotel. I head to the east and James heads to the west side of the floor. The room is larger than I thought it would be, a small tv 12 inches and a big queen-sized bed. Two lamps sitting on two dressers and right by the window a desk for work. I take in the view for a few minutes before going to bed.

 

In the morning, I report to Matt along with James and a few others for my first day on the job. Me and James are responsible for helping lay pipes. The trucks bring the pipes into the machines, put the pipes in place and we weld the pipes together. The work is hard but rewarding and me and James love to do it. After work me, James and a few others hit the local bar for drinks and wings. After eating and drinking for two hours James who's had less to drink than anyone else, drives everyone home to the hotel. Back at the hotel I order a little room service and get ready for bed my mind wonders to the mermaid I wonder if I'll ever see her again.

 

 James stops by my room before he goes to bed just to ask me if I wanna come over to his room for a beer. I reminded him we have work in the morning and told him thanks anyway. James returns to his room, and I get to bed not wanting to stay up too late. In the morning, my alarm goes off and I get dressed and head to James's room, he's not answering he must be downstairs. I walk downstairs and enjoy the free breakfast pancakes eggs and sausage I could live here forever. I still haven’t seen James anywhere and his truck isn't parked in the lot. Catching a ride with one of the other guys from work a pale hairy man named Paul.

 

Once Paul and I arrive at work we see all the guys gathered together and I can see James truck parked near the worksite. Matt sees me and Paul and orders us to join the rest of the group on the sidelines. ""Now that everyone's here I can tell there's been an accident here last night, one of our own got drunk and fell through the ice,"" said Matt. I can't believe what Matts was saying, after the meeting, I head to Matts trailer and take the keys to James truck and then he tells me I have to go identify his remains. Matt tells me to take the rest of the day off after I I.D. the body.

 I took James's truck into town and visited the local funeral home. The mortician who runs the funeral home is also a coroner. I walk into his office, and he tells me he'll show me the body after lunch. He asked me if I've ever been to Big Mama's I said yes and we went to lunch. After a wonderful meatloaf served with warm soft mashed potatoes I eat and get ready to see my best friend's body. The coroner takes me to the coolers where he has James's body. I stand in the room waiting for him to unlock James body once he does, I'm surprised at how normal he looks I expected to see a rotting corpse and am glad to see my friend looks normal. After I, I.D. him the coroner gives me some papers to fill out and I sign them and leave.   

After a few hours getting drunk at Big Mama’s, I drive to the spot where James died drunk and angry I wonder around stumbling drunk. The thick ice under my feet begins to crack. I go under the water and a rush of cold overtakes me. I close my eyes and out of nowhere, something grabs hold of me. I open my eyes and see her image of my mermaid. She has me and kisses me deeply. All around me I feel warm as if she can remove the cold from me with her touch. We kiss under the water for what seems like hours than I pass out. I am awakened in the morning by Matt and a few others who show up for work. The group of men takes in the sight of me with beer cans scattered about and Matt calls me to his office.

 I walk in soaking wet and sit in a chair Matt asks me if I was trying to kill myself and I don't answer. I don't have an answer for him Matt sends me home for the day and tells me to come to work with my head on straight or not to come at all. I headed back to the hotel when I got a call from the coroner, he told me he needs to talk with me alone. I fire up James's truck and head into town, the coroner asks me to meet him at Big Mama's so he can grab a drink. I tell him there's a bar not too far from there, but he insists on Big Mama’s, so I meet him there. Big Mama led us to a quiet table in the back and I asked the coroner Mike Luis what he wanted to talk about.

 

Mike tells me that when he saw me last, he purposely lied to me when we met. I wasn't sure what he meant by that, ""I mislead you into thinking James's death was normal."" said Mike the coroner. I saw James's body; everything was fine I told the coroner who was looking down at his beer not to drink it. After a few minutes waiting for him to say anything, the coroner finally tells me the truth about James's death. He tells me that James's body had strange marks on it and weird bites. He sits with me for hours telling me about the autopsy I lose my appetite the more he describes cutting into my friend. As night falls on the diner me and the coroner go our separate ways. I returned to my hotel room and spent the night thinking of what the coroner said.

In the morning, I headed to work and apologized for my actions yesterday, Matt tells me all is forgiven and to get to work. I spend the next few hours welding with Doug and Carrie while Paul brings us coffee and doughnuts. The group shares a few laughs and out of nowhere the ice cracks and the four of us go under. It's like a feeding frenzy, at first sight, I think their sharks but then I get a closer look. Mermen and women come from everywhere, one of the creatures has me pinned to an ice wall when my mermaid comes for me. She stabs the merman holding me and breathes life into me as I look around and see the Massacre my friends being torn apart by the Mer people. Carrie has her mouth torn off and nibbled at by a merwoman. Doug holds his breath while two mermen tear into his belly and poor Paul is just dragged under by the Mer people drowned alive.  

 

 

Opening my eyes I see my boss Matt and he tells me that the ice cracked under my feet and half the team went under. I look around and notice I'm in the hospital after a few minutes of asking Matt what happened to the others. He tells me they all drowned, and their bodies were unrecoverable. All night I tossed and turned thinking about what I saw and if it was real. That night I couldn't sleep, I had to know what happened. In the morning, I check myself out of the hospital and go to see the coroner. I corner him in the funeral home and ask to see James's body. It was a tough time for Mike who was in the middle of trying to sell a coffin to a grieving family at the time, but I insisted he talk to me. Taking me to his work area I help him get James's body on the operating table and he shows me the wounds. Each wound was like an animal had done it as I flashback to what happened when I went under all I can think is these animals killed my best friend. How could they how she, my mermaid, there's only one thing left for me to do and that's find some way to get revenge. The day after I see the coroner I return to work but find the job site closed and safety inspectors all over the place. Outside his trailer stands Matt. I go over to him and ask if I'm early for work, but he tells me the job site is closed until further notice which means I'm out of a job.

 

Three weeks have passed since the safety inspectors closed down the job site. Since then, I've been working with the coroner doing odd jobs. I spend my night's drinking thinking about all the friends I've lost and sulking. Working for a mortician is hard and disgusting work. If I weren't already a drunk this work would drive me to drink. I became a regular at Big Mama’s, it makes her sad to see me there drinking every night. Mike and I become friends, and Big Mama knows to call him if I get too drunk. This is one of those nights I shut my eyes for a minute and when I open them, I'm in Mike's SUV. It's been a long night so I rest my eyes because the job could restart at any point the company that hired me keeps paying for our hotel rooms.

But they don't pay us a dime so some people like me work odd jobs, others just stay in their rooms drinking and getting high. I wait till nighttime to make my move once I know the safety inspectors are gone. I easily passed the sleeping security guard on duty. It’s past midnight and he's asleep. Walking onto the worksite I see the hole we all fell into covered up. I lift part of the cover off the water and begin to pour a gallon filled with blood from the butcher shop into the water and wait I stand close to the edge of the water may be to close as the ice starts to crack under my feet I run for safety past the security guard in his chair I dive past him and the ice stops cracking. Out of the water leaps, a merman half man half shark he lunges at me and the guard wakes up only to be impaled by the merman's arm spike. I stab the merman as he's fighting with the guard, cutting the merman's throat I drag the dead merman into James's truck and drive to the funeral home.

 

In the dead of night, I drag the body of the merman into the funeral parlor and wake up Mike Luis. Mike has a million questions for me as we lift the dead merman onto the exam table. Mike has no idea what to do with this dead fish-man and looks to me to tell him what to do. Showing Mike the dead merman's claw-like fingers, Mike gets his tools and prepares to operate on the merman. Cutting into the merman Mike vomits a little on the floor and walks away from the operating table. I tell Mike not to lose his nerve and finish the dissection after hours of dissecting the merman Mike tells me ""Their more fish than human, their insides are fish-like."" I thank Mike for the obvious information. And he reminds me he's not a doctor he's a coroner ""I can tell you how this thing died but I can't tell you what it is.""

 It feels like a loss getting this body here and showing it to Mike only for him to tell me nothing about it, the whole thing felt like a waste of time. Out of nowhere men in black suits swarm the building and grab me and Mike. As they pull us from the operating table, we see the men throw a tarp over the body and take it away. Mike and I are led to a black van and handcuffed to our seats. The windows of the van are blacked out and we can't see anything outside the white insides of the van. We try to ask what's going on but none of the men in black will talk with us.

 

The van drives for hours until it suddenly stops, and Mike and I are pulled out of the van onto our bellies. The men in black pull out their guns and tell us to look at the ground. Out of nowhere, a woman's voice tells the men to lower their guns and let us up. The woman light brown skin hair in a bun wearing a dark blue suit with a gray skirt offers us a cup of coffee. I look at Mike and follow his lead. The sun is starting to rise. I wonder how long we've been driving and where we are. The walls all around us are metal, we're inside I know that much but it's cold. The woman who offered us the coffee introduces herself as Deputy director Natalie woods. She calls herself a government agent but what government would let her abduct people like this. She offers us a tour of the facility ""WHAT FACILITY."" I asked her but she just gestured to the door leading us away from the van. We walked past the body of the security guard, and I realized we were at my job site. They must have driven around in circles for hours to throw us off their scent. We walk to an elevator inside the hidden building, and it takes us straight down. After almost half an hour riding straight down the elevator stops and we dismount. Looking around I see huge glass windows and swimming past them are Mer people some bash their heads up against the glass while others swim past the glass spearing fish and playing games.

 

Seeing all these Mer people I ask director Woods why they let us build on this land if they know about the Mer people. She tells me there would be no way to stop us from building without telling us about the Mer people. I asked her what's going to happen to Mike and me and she told me if we could forget what we saw she can let us go. We both agree and are released. Ms. Woods tells me not to return to the worksite or I'll be rearrested and fed to the Mer people. Understanding everything she had to say we left and didn’t return. Back at the funeral home Mike and I make some sandwiches and don't speak a word to each other.

I can tell Mike is mad at me, so I take my sandwich to go. I thought of heading to the hotel but instead, I drove to the shore house. Looking around at the abandoned house I see the signs that someone had left in a hurry. With posters still on the walls and food bowls in the sink unwashed and dirty line the sink. I sit on the sofa and relax eating my sandwich. Out of nowhere, I hear a loud sound piercing the air and knocking me out. I wake up inside a cave tied to a huge stone. All around me are men and women wearing long robes and by my side tied up next to me is Mike. The long, black-robed people walk around us in a circle out of nowhere a woman's voice cuts through the silence. It's the voice of deputy director Woods.

 

The cave falls silent like Mike, and I process everything that's happening to us. I question her government connections, and she tells me she is a government agent, but the government works with the Mer people to keep anyone from finding out about their existence. Deputy director Woods and her fellow agents untie Mike from the rock and drag him to the beach and put him into a boat. I'm still tied up in the cave and can hardly see what's happening. Seeing me strain to get a look Ms. Woods orders her men to drag me down to the beach to get a better look at Mike her men put me into the boat as well. She orders Mike to be lowered into the water once we get far out to sea and tells her men to stick my head under the water.

 I see the Mer people gathering around and I see Mike holding his breath underwater. I hold my breath as well and wait for something to happen. As merchildren gather around him, Mike shakes his head to scare them away they look like a large school of fish the way they swim around Mike after a few minutes of playing with him one of the Kids takes a bite out of Mike I look on in shock as one after the other the children begin biting and eating Mike I look on in horror as Mike tries scream underwater his lungs fill with water and nothing comes out. After a few minutes, it's over and they pull me out of the water. Tying me up just like they did Mike Luis the Insane robed Lunatics' lower me into the water.

After a few minutes of waiting nothing happens, none of the Mer people come for me and I'm left to drown. At the very last second before my eyes closed forever, I saw her my mermaid. She kisses air into my lungs and cuts the ropes holding me as we swim away into the night never to be seen again.

So, I (28F) got fired—already a rough start to the week. But life wasn’t done with me yet. Two days later, my 30M long-distance boyfriend, who was literally visiting me, decided this was the perfect time to break up.  

His reasoning? ""He can’t keep coming to visit me"". Okay, fair, travel is exhausting. But then he hits me with “I’ve been unhappy for a while""-which, uh, would’ve been great to know before he decided to stay with me for at least two more months?

I tried to meet him halfway, said I’d visit once or twice this year. His response? “That’s not enough”—in the gentlest, most let-me-soften-the-blow way possible. Then, eventually, he drops the classic “I need a break”, and for me, that’s a full stop. Done. Over. F*** him.

1iipfu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1iipfu5/nfather_is_harassing_me_and_hurting_my_brother_tw/,Nfather is harassing me and hurting my brother (TW// EMOTIONAL ABUSE),"The abuse from my father started happening when I was 4. My parents were divorcing, but my father had an obsession with control so he would force my mother to stay with him. He would leave to go on “tours,” (he believes he is a Broadway star) leaving me and my brother with my mom. When he would come back, we would be verbally and mentally berated constantly. My mom suffered the worst of it. He had the money so she was kicked out of the house and forced to live in a hotel with no job and my father fabricated evidence of abuse from her so he could get a restraining order against her. she was eventually able to get half custody of me and my brother.

My dad believes he is the second coming of Christ. My brother and I would have cruel and unusual punishments put on us as children. we would be locked in closets for hours, we would get school graduations taken away because I wouldn’t tell my dad about the people she’s seeing. He would tower over me and yell at me about how my stepfather was a child molester (he has never done anything to me). He would make the police come to our house and explain to me that privacy was not a given right to children after I was walked in on while changing my menstrual pad. He took away my clothes, my furniture in my room, he would drive me to friends’ houses and make me unfriend them as a punishment. My dad is a very scary person and I am deeply messed up because of it. I was constantly confused and accused of trying to pit my parents against each other. I was finally able to escape after going to extremes and threatening to unalive myself at school so I would be taken to a mental facility. I refused to leave until I knew I was not going to see him again.

I was a fighter, I wanted to see how far the abuse would go so I could collect as much evidence as possible. My father befriended the social workers that were seeing me. He befriended court mediators and therapists and bribed them into telling them private information. My brother, however, is autistic and he has been influenced by my father to hate me and my mother. my father has convinced him that we are abusive. He’s falsely accused my mother of poisoning us with NyQuil as children when I have no recollection of this. My dad is constantly posting on Facebook about how my brother is having seizures because of the “poisoning.” I believe this is a severe case of Munchhausen by proxy. 

I have reported the mediators and therapists to the BBB for unethical practices. I’m wondering if I can protect my brother somehow. He is 23 and is being financially and emotionally abused and controlled by my father. They have moved to a different state. I think it’s gotten to the point where my brother believes what he is being told, therefore will not believe me or my mother about the fact that he is being abused. My father has used my brother’s discord account to message me and has admitted to going through my brother’s phone and checking his texts. I know it’s my dad because my brother would never use proper punctuation or capitalization in his sentences. 

my brother is on several different types of antipsychotic medications and is on several medications to help with his “seizures” being caused by the alleged poisoning. I was in contact with my father for a short period of time because I thought he would come around but he’s only gotten sicker. The last time I saw my brother was 2021. I took him around in my car to get coffee and he hugged me and started crying for about an hour, begging me not to leave. I don’t know what I can do. My dad is very smart and does not leave much evidence, most of his admissions have been during phone calls.

we had a falling out recently because I would not cut my mother out of my life. He believes she is the epitome of evil and that I am directly influenced by her even though I barely see her because I have a life and family of my own. His entire worldview is skewed by his sickness. He sees people as wholly good or wholly bad, depending on who they pledge their allegiance to. In his mind, it’s him versus my mom. It’s been 10 years and every conversation I have had with him was about my mom.

now he is harassing me, sending me 7-10 long texts a day, reminding me of the “hurt” I caused when I was a child, reacting to the abuse. I would take my anger, confusion, and frustration out on my brother and my friends, but I never abused anybody. I feel like I caused my brother to pull away and into the abuse because I was bad at keeping it inside. He believes that I was the mastermind trying to pit him and my mom against each other for my own benefit when I was eight years old. he is harassing my husband as well, texting him paragraphs absolutely slandering me and we are both sick of it. My dad isn’t the type to be outright dangerous because he is afraid of leaving evidence, but I’m afraid that he’s going to snap. 

Thank you for reading this, and if you have any advice please let me know. This is a very scary and weird situation. I now know not to ever contact him again, but I think as children of narcissistic parents, we are desperate to be proven right or to have some sort of closure/reconciliation with our abusers.

With just a coin and a little luck, you could reveal a life-changing prize in seconds! Scratch-offs have been a favorite pastime for years, offering a mix of fun, anticipation, and the potential for **big rewards**.

These stories remind us that **anything is possible** when you take a chance.

# Understanding the Odds: The Reality Behind Scratch-Off Games

State lotteries operate as businesses, ensuring that **more money goes in than comes out**. Unlike other income-building activities, scratch-off tickets have **fixed odds** that favor the house. Here are some key statistics:

✅ **Payout Percentage**: Most scratch-off games return about **60-75%** of ticket sales in prizes, meaning **25-40% is lost to overhead and state funding**. ✅ **Winning Chances**: The odds of winning big vary, but in most cases, the top prizes are **1 in 1-3 million**. ✅ **High vs. Low-Cost Tickets**: More expensive tickets ($20-$50) typically offer **better odds** than lower-cost ones ($1-$5).

# Smart Strategies to Maximize Your Play 🎯

While scratch-offs are largely about luck, seasoned players follow certain strategies to **enhance their experience**:

🧐 **Check the Odds** – Most state lottery websites list the odds of each game. Some scratch-offs have **better winning percentages** than others!

🔄 **Stick to One Game** – Instead of switching between different tickets, some players prefer to play the same game consistently to increase their chances over time.

🎫 **Buy in Batches** – Purchasing tickets in sets (e.g., 5-10 from the same roll) may improve the likelihood of hitting a win, as big prizes are often spread throughout a batch.

📍 **Find “Hot” Locations** – Some stores have a track record of selling winning tickets. While it’s not a guarantee, some believe in playing where luck has struck before!

🛑 **Set a Fun Budget** – Enjoy the thrill without overextending! Many players set aside a small amount for scratch-offs, keeping the experience light and enjoyable.

# Play Smart, Have Fun, and Keep Scratching!

Scratch-offs bring **excitement, surprises, and real winners** every day. Whether you play occasionally for fun or make it part of your routine, the thrill of **revealing a big win** is unmatched.

\------------

*“A curtain of night under a bejeweled sky.”*

In a flash, I remembered Lucy was under the same sky. But not with me.

She was with Barb.

I wrenched my phone out of my pocket; the heavens tinting the screen ghostly, neon colors as I saw what I ignored while searching for *The Last Great Seer.*

4 missed calls from Lucy, followed by a text message and a picture.

*“Barb gathered nearly everyone at the chapel, except Ari. Practically everyone in town was tormented by the prophecy when they were young. They’re all acting crazy. What they’re talking about doing is insane. Come ASAP and bring Shep.”*

Although none of us are religious, we use an abandoned Pentecostal church as our town hall. It’s the biggest communal space we have.

The picture was hazy and out of focus, which I took to mean that Lucy had taken it in secret. There was a white board next to the pulpit, which was covered in things like:

***-Excavate its jades from their hallowed sockets, and their visions of Apocalypse will cease. ?Remove eyes. (5 Tally marks next to it)***

***-Excise the bull’s manhood, and Apocalypse will fall. ?Castration (2 Tally marks)***

***-Flay its carapace, and Apocalypse will be exposed. ?Skinning (4 Tally marks)***

The list went on and on.

Standing at the pulpit, I could clearly see Barb, eyes burning with frenzy, hands gesturing wildly toward the pews.

\------------

*“Barbara…you need to stand down,”* Shep growled, his words echoing up into the rafters of the vast cathedral.

Hundreds of bodies turned in the pews to face the sheriff as he and I entered. There had been lively chatter when we first walked in, with the entire town debating the most appropriate violence to inflict on Ari, our green-eyed harbinger. Now, there was only silence. A thick, suffocating quiet, made dense by the thousands of words that lingered impatiently on people’s tongues but remained unsaid.

I peered around from behind Shepard, trying to locate my wife in the frozen mob. As my eyes moved up the length of the church, I eventually found her. Ahead of the pews, there was a raised area with a pulpit and an altar. A rusty pipe organ mounted against the back wall framed the stage, with its dilapidated metal cylinders curving around the pulpit like the tendrils of a kraken twisting around the hull of a ship.

Lucy was sitting on the bench in front of the organ, deeply sequestered behind rows of townspeople and Barbara, who stood in front of the pulpit, head shaking with divine indignation like a magistrate looking upon a convicted witch at Salem.

*“Shepard, what right do you have to overthrow the will of the people? You work for us, not the other way around,”* she boomed from the safety of her podium.

Murmurs of agreement radiated throughout the crowd. Barb had clearly persuaded them, but they hadn’t completely succumbed to frenzy.

Not yet, at least.

*“Open your eyes, sheriff. That whale died on our shore. The birds aren’t flying. The town lacks electricity, and a strange light pervades the sky. All on the same day, all after Ari’s arrival. Do you think we enjoy convening by candlelight? Do you truly believe our pain had no purpose?”*

To my astonishment, I found myself agreeing with Barb. A peculiar relief poured over me as I listened. Involuntarily, I swallowed and nodded my head.

Shep turned and shot me a look of pure disgust, having sensed my wavering allegiance. As much as I treasured his respect, and as much as I knew what we were considering was morally unconscionable, I couldn’t help but find comfort in Barb’s narrative. We had all suffered at the feet of this prophecy, and we had endured that suffering alone - until today. The warmth that came from a room full of people that understood felt like morphine in my blood.

*“Alright folks, let make this all abundantly clear for you.”*

The sheriff walked forward onto the carpeted aisle as he spoke, leaving me and my smoldering collusion behind.

*“I do not deny your pain. Nor am I saying that I understand what’s happening here today. I don’t think anyone has a good explanation for what all of that is.”*

He beckoned out one of the cathedral’s tall windows at the blankets of blue-green light swimming ominously through the night sky. But there was something else on the glass that he didn’t call our attention to. Something that caused the hairs on the nape of my neck to stand on end.

Tiny beads of dripping liquid, absorbing and refracting the cosmic light as they painted long lines down the window. Every tempest starts as a drizzle of rain.

I started pacing forward to grab Shep, knowing what could be next to follow.

*“I wish I understood your pain, and I wish I understood what you experienced, truly, I do,”* he continued.

*“But here’s something I do understand. It’s simple, and it’s universally applicable: ‘Thou shalt not kill’. The activities y’all have listed up on that whiteboard - castration, skinning, hobbling, amputating, blinding - they’ll kill that poor man. And he won’t pass on quietly, neither. So, ask yourselves: something is demanding y’all do those things to Ari, but is it worth giving up your humanity to do it? I know the prophecy says a lake of fire will eat the world if you don’t hurt him, but I mean, if you become demons to save us, did you really avoid creating hell?”*

When I reached him, he was nearly at the pulpit, looking up to meet Barb’s burning gaze. Wind whipped against the church’s rickety woodwork, causing the walls to seemingly buckle and expand with the current. Hefty droplets of rainfall crashed against the rooftop like the hooves of a stampede. I grabbed his forearm and pulled myself up to my tiptoes so my whispers could meet his ear.

*“I know you don’t believe this is happening, but we need to go. The next part of the prophecy is ‘the death of a king amidst a sweeping Tempest. We haven’t had a mayor in over a decade, so you’re the closest thing this town has to a king.”*

Barb’s voice cut through the sounds of the storm like a crack of thunder.

*“Meghan! Are you conspiring with the Sheriff? Are the both of you planning on standing in the way of what needs to be done?”*

People rose from the pews, staring daggers into Shep and I. At first, it was just a handful. But the more venom Barb spewed, the more of our neighbors answered her call.

*“They have chosen us! The universe, in its infinite wisdom, has selected us to prevent Apocalypse. Would you really deprive of us of our destiny and damn the world to conflagration, all just to protect a man who you hardly even know? An outsider, no less?”*

A crowd gathered in the aisle, preventing our only escape route. I swung my head from side to side, looking for an opening, a hole in the mob that Shep and I might be able to squeeze through, but I found nothing.

With the people closing in on us, I turned to face the sheriff, who had become eerily motionless in the preceding few seconds. When I saw his expression, my heart transformed from meat into lead and it plummeted through the bottom of my chest.

His eyes were empty and glazed over, like marbles painted to resemble human eyes. The left half of his face sagged unnaturally downward, making it look like those features were being subjected to a different, more potent force of gravity than his right. A stream of dribble fell from the corner of his mouth and down his chin, dripping on to my shirt collar as I stood paralyzed in front of him.

Before anyone actually reached us, Shepard crumpled to the floor like a discarded marionette, limp and lifeless. The crowd stopped moving, and the room once again became filled with that thick silence.

I followed him to the floor, knelling over him with hot tears welling up in my eyes.

*“Shep - Shep…oh God…oh God.”*

No matter how much I called out to him, no matter how much I shook him, Shep would didn’t wake up. He’d never wake up again, actually.

My eyes darted around the room, but no one was dialing 9-1-1.

*“Phones still work, right?!”* I screamed in disbelief.

*“What the fuck are you all waiting for? He’s having a stroke?!”* I bellowed through my sobs.

No one moved an inch.

*“Fuck all of you, fuck all of you right to hell.”*

My hand moved to pull my cellphone from my back pocket, but somebody caught my wrist from behind and held it tightly in the air.

I assumed it was Barb, so I balled my other hand into a sturdy fist and swung it towards my captor, but it never made contact. Shock and despair caused the punch to dissolve mid-flight.

Lucy was the one who was holding me back.

“*Good job, sweetheart.”* Barb cooed from behind the pulpit.

Still on the floor of the cathedral next to the dying man, my breathing became ragged and my muscles turned into puddy. Flickering candlelight danced over Lucy’s face as I looked into it for answers. Resignation and sorrow marked her expression, but it was clear that she acted calmly and deliberately. Apparently, my wife was more than willing to let Shep perish in an undignified heap on the ground with the whole town watching, a fate that mirrored the stranded leviathan in a way that twisted my stomach into knots.

*“I’m…”* is the only word Lucy vocalized before Barb started delivering commands.

*“Juan, gather the rope from your car so we can restrain Meghan. Trisha, I want you to take Jeremy, Phil, and Weijen out to the 23rd. Ari’s house is the blue ranchero on the corner. Avery, Tom, Martha - could you kindly pull the sheriff’s body out back? The church has a freezer, but there’s still no electricity. We can’t preserve him. Best we can do is an impromptu burial.”*

She then stepped forward from the pulpit slightly to crane her neck around the whiteboard.

*“Looks like the majority of us recall that last instruction to be* ***excavate its jades from their hallowed sockets, and their visions of Apocalypse will cease,*** *so I guess we’ll start there.”*

\-----------

Once the mob tied me to a folding chair, they at least had the decency to place me next to Lucy, up on the stage by the pipe organ. I think they viewed it as decency, at least. In reality, I would have preferred being tossed into the wet dirt next to a possibly still alive Shepard.

Her betrayal had cut so deep.

She tried to justify her actions, but I wasn’t having any of it. This town and its people were Shep’s life, and this is how they chose to repay him. He was there when our basement flooded, lugging water logged furniture onto our lawn in the summer heat. When Lucy’s parents died in a car crash, he sat at our kitchen table and drank coffee with us every day for a month, listening intently and giving advice where he could. When we finally thought IVF worked, only to have it end in a miscarriage, Shep was there to give me a shoulder to cry on. Lucy, perpetually avoidant of discomfort, was off drinking by herself somewhere farther into the mainland.

That was just *our* lives, though. Every person in that church probably had their own collection of stories, iterating Shepard’s wisdom, kindness, and philanthropy. And every single person in that church let him expire on the floor like a mutt. It felt unbelievable, but that was actually the better of the two potential outcomes, too. No one took his pulse as they carried him out of the cathedral, despite my pleas. He might not have died on the church floor. Instead, Shep may have died in a cold pit, mud and soil filling his lungs as he stared helplessly up into the faces of his neighbors as they proceeded to bury him alive.

From their perspective, feeling for a heartbeat was a gamble that had no upside. Barb wanted him in the ground, so he was going into that hole, dead or alive. Why risk confirming that they were sentencing the man to a premature burial?

Dwelling on it made me physically sick.

When I saw a group of them re-entering the church with Ari, his face black and blue from a beating, my anguish turned into something more useful; seething rage.

*“****Does any of this even make any goddamned sense****?”* I screamed, cheeks and chest flushed bright red.

My outburst was abrupt and unexpected. Startled, a few people nearly jumped out of their own skin. Lucy included.

*“I get the insanity of us all being tormented by the prophecy, but I mean, think about it: Ari’s been here for over a week. Its not like everything happened the moment he stepped foot in town. We live on the coast. We’ve had beached whales before, remember?*

*“We’re going to torture and kill a man over a beached whale, a few dumb birds, and some faulty wiring?”*

*“And* ***why*** *would there be these differences in the prophetic instructions? I counted sixteen separate lines listed on that white board. Does* ***anyone*** *have a good way to explain that? For fuck’s sake, what the would be the point?”*

Barb turned to face me, and I swear I saw her chuckle. I think she tried to get a word in edge-wise, but that goddamned chuckle was like throwing a cannister of gasoline into a bonfire.

*“****And Shepard! Fucking Shepard****. He was the sheriff, you fucking lunatics. He wasn’t a king. They aren’t even close to the same position! Barb is forcing a square peg through a circular hole, but you all are so brainwashed that you’re not even thinking about it!”*

*“This isn’t some divine responsibility. This isn’t the universe asking us to be brave in the face of Apocalypse. No, this is…this is something else.”*

Unfortunately, I felt myself losing steam. They had just brought Ari onto the stage. Seeing his wild, fearful eyes and his bloody, swollen mouth up close was diluting my focus.

*“If…if someone can just look at my phone, I have proof. There was…there was a burn…some type of burn on the whale…I mean the Leviathan. There’s…something going on that we don’t completely understand. Shep…oh God, Shep…he drove me over to the boardwalk. We…we saw The Last Great Seer. There was a plug in the back…I think…I think that it could be used like a telephone…”*

Juan, a burly Dominican man who ran the local deli, forcefully pushed the green-eyed harbinger into a folding chair so he was facing me, only a few feet away. Ari peered up at his captor, mumbling pleas of mercy through intermittent sobs. Absentmindedly, the outsider tried to meet Juan’s gaze by swiveling his torso, rather than remaining still as instructed. Ari wasn’t trying to escape, that much was clear. He was trying to make an appeal to his humanity by looking into his eyes.

A set of knuckles careened into his jaw in response to that appeal, releasing the sickening type of crunch that accompanies bone crushing bone.

The young man toppled from the folding chair onto the floor. I watched in horror as Juan, Barb and a few others circled around him like carrion birds flying above fresh road kill. Anytime he moved, the group sent a flurry of kicks into his ribs and abdomen. Once they had tenderized him to the point of near unconsciousness, they dragged his limp body back into the folding chair and secured him with the same rope they had used to secure me.

*“You’re all fucking animals…”* I whispered.

Ari’s head hung motionless, chin to chest. The metallic scent of newly liberated blood drifted through the air like smoke. Even though I was unharmed, I could still almost taste it, wet copper lurching over the tip of my tongue.

*“****You’re all…fucking…animals-****”* my scream muffled by someone behind me stuffing a sock into my mouth.

A barrage of primal shrieks leapt up from my vocal cords, but they barely made any noise through the thick fabric. With both of their prisoners subdued, Barb, Juan and the rest of the group jumped off the stage, discussing preparations for the main event with the crowd of people that was gathering in the aisle.

Slowly, Ari lifted his head to midline. To my confusion, his expression of fear had dissipated, seemingly beaten out of him. He concentrated, perking his ears and moving his eyes from side to side, clearly trying to determine if there was anyone nearby. Satisfied that no one was within earshot, he dragged his eyes forward to meet mine.

They were almost bulging from their sockets. Not with terror. Not with confusion. His jades were agape with frenzy, somehow burning even brighter than Barb’s were.

I felt my thoughts freeze and body overheat like an old radiator as I observed the corners of Ari’s mouth curl upwards.

He smiled at me.

With no one else watching, his lips contorted into a rapturous Cheshire Cat’s grin, violent and uncanny.

Ari tilted his head forward, cloaking everything but his teeth in shadow. Quivering candles illuminated his jaw with a frail spotlight, and I couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by a grim nostalgia.

Just like *The Last Great Seer did* forty years prior, Ari seared a series of apocalyptic words into my consciousness. But these words were new. And unlike the prophecy, these words may have truly been conjured for me alone.

*“Kings can bleed, governments can collapse, and Gods…Gods can fade. These masters can die because they’re artificial. We made them.”*

*“But superstition…superstition is immortal. Its tangled within us, to our very core. It’s undying because it’s hereditary, a ghost in our DNA.”*

*“You can’t kill the inseparable, Meghan.”*

Suddenly, as quickly as it came, the green-eyed harbinger’s grin vanished

With his mask of fear nailed on tight, Ari placed his chin to his chest and waited for deliverance.

\-----------

I find myself unwilling or unable to detail what came next.

Just know that, by the time the town was finished with him, Ari had been thoroughly disassembled.

Until the break of dawn, they worked their way down the white board’s profane list. From what I could tell, the original plan was to only subject Ari to the violent instructions that held a majority from the town’s combined memories.

But bloodletting always begets more bloodletting.

This is the Apocalypse we’re talking about, after all. And they couldn’t be one hundred percent sure which vile act was the key to saving us.

Better safe than sorry, right?

When the sun rose, unaccompanied by conflagration, they patted themselves on the back.

They buried what remained of Ari, if that’s even his real name, in an unmarked grave next to Shepard.

And that’s what hurt me the most.

\-----------

Have you ever heard of a geomagnetic storm?

I sure as shit hadn’t, not until a man claiming to be an environmental services worker called our home the morning after our town enacted the prophecy. They told me they were looking to speak to Shep, that he had called them about a beached whale twenty four hours ago. Now, for whatever reason, they found themselves unable to reach him. They believed they had an explanation for what happened, and they wanted to pass that explanation along.

I won’t pretend like I understand the science of it all, but I can give you all the broad strokes.

Rarely, when the sun emits a wave of energy, known as a solar wind, it can reach earth and disrupt our magnetic fields. Now, stop me if any of these phenomena sound familiar.

Animals like birds, which rely on internal magnetism to guide migration, can become disoriented when magnetic fields are disrupted, grounding themselves until their physiology is restored. In some cases, whales have been known to beach themselves, as they also rely on magnetism for guidance.

Electrical systems can fail, too. Hell, some theorists have speculated that magnetic shifts can cause the formation of a transient Aurora Borelias in places that aren’t normally associated with that type of cosmic occurrence.

At first, I’m wondering why I’m being told all of this. But then, it hits me. Another grim nostalgia.

I’m listening to the hollow, monotoned voice from my childhood. They hid it at first, no doubt wanting to keep me on the line long enough to gloat. As they finished confirming my suspicions that everything our town did was not born of divine purpose, however, they let the masquerade fall.

Once I realized it was them, I hung up. I didn’t need to hear anymore.

\-----------

You might ask yourself, what’s the point? Well, here it is.

I think we were all part of some grand experiment. Someone wanted to prove that they could condition a group of people to commit heinous atrocities without the justification of patriotism, financial incentive, or religious zealotry. They wanted to show that intelligent, well-adjusted members of society could enact hell on earth in pursuit of preventing an Apocalypse, ignoring any contradictory information that may stand in their way. All they needed was a way to manifest apocalyptic conditions at the right time, which, apparently, involved a localized disruption of magnetic fields.

They may have to nudge the circumstances along, of course. Maybe a Leviathan didn’t beach itself as intended, so they sent someone down to electrocute the damn thing, and then they pulled it to shore.

They felt so confident in their hypothesis, in fact, that they said:

*“Hey - I bet these animals will do it even if we give them different instructions on how to do it. That’s how well this going to work.”*

The point is this: our group was just a prototype. A trial run of sorts. I believe we were preparation for a larger, more horrific conditioning event.

So, I’m here to provide a cautionary tale. It’s the least I can do for Shepard.

Look around you. How many of your coworkers, friends, and family members use astrology to guide their actions? We think we’ve evolved beyond myth and superstition, but that’s an outright lie, and the belief hurts us more than it helps us.

Don’t believe me?

Pull out your phone, open the application store, and search for the phrase “*The Last Great Seer”.* Should be listed under astrology or cosmology.

1iipb3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1iipb3n/first_time_trying_source_and_hexennacht_several/,"First time trying Source and Hexennacht, several reviews each","I was really into indie perfume 15-20 years ago (BPAL was my drug of choice mostly) and just recently decided to poke my nose back in. 

Loves: gourmand-adjacent, and some straight up gourmand. A few chilly/ice scents. A good number of darker spicy, goth blends. (BPAL’s Snake Oil and Snake Charmer for example). Citrus, all of them. Bergamot and neroli. Vanilla, of all kinds. Patchouli, situationally. 

Nopes: Big white florals (jasmine is a particular nemesis usually). Honey. Strong leather. Strong aquatics. Most aldehydes. Cherry, if I can detect it. Dirt. Heavy pine. 

SORCE

**Snow Moon Magic**- *“lavender sugar, vanilla steamed milk, chai spices, tonka bean, cashmeran, ambroxan, crystal accord, marshmallow, cookie butter, Tahitian vanilla”* very cozy. I mostly get cookie, sort of ginger snappy. I’m guessing that’s the chai at work. I love a good lavender-gourmand, I wish this had more lavender TBH. Overall quite nice, but a little too Just Cookies for me. (Possibly I need to try the non snowy version?) Not super strong, but lasted well. (Oil.) 3.5/5

**The Lovers**- *“bergamot, iris, jasmine sambac, bamboo, vetiver, green banana, mysore sandalwood, styrax, green woody iris”* The jasmine scared me but nope, this one is lovely! It was quite lowkey on me, and short lived (oil). It smells VERY similar to Guerlain Neroli Outrenoir to me, with bamboo instead of tea. I think my nose confuses bergamot and neroli a lot, and I love both of them. As it dries down, the woods come forward. 4/5

**A Party, Or Something**- *“marigolds, yellow cake, white chocolate, pistachio buttercream, iso E super, cashmeran”* This is the sort of gourmand-adjacent I love. The marigold is such a unique, fun top note! It’s very clear, bright and springy, and pops right out front. It quiets down pretty fast as the ISO E and cashmeran bloom. It’s not cloying, nor is it a basic straight-up gourmand… in fact I’d say the cake takes a backseat. This would make a bomb spring/summer scent. Moderate throw, lasted well, I loved the evolution of the scent a lot from the pop of the initial marigold top note to the gentler fuzzy drydown. (Oil.) The pistachio is present and accounted for, but mild. Love it! 5/5

**Falling Stars (black)**- *“black coffee, almond cream, sandalwood, natural oud, palo santo oil, tonka bean absolute, and vanilla bean”* Wood, coffee, hint of almond. It is… nice. I like it. The wood does come out stronger upon dry down. Looking forward to trying the salted cream flanker. Not super strong but lasts well (oil). 3.5/5

**Something Wicked**- *”vanilla, patchouli, sandalwood, whiskey”* Yes. It’s got the same vibe as Memento Mori  By Kilian that I love. The whiskey and vanilla, I expect- those are the main notes I’m getting, the patchouli and sandalwood are the background deliciousness. This is a darker slinky vibe- but cozy. Kind of faint, wish it was stronger. This is the one I will get a full size of because my husband steals my Memento Mori and I hate being scent twinsies. All in all, fuck yeah. 4.5/5 for not mollywhopping me, hopefully the alcohol formula does.

**2AM in Lafayette**- *”vanilla CO2, oak moss, cafe au lait, caramel, beignets and powdered sugar”* Strong burnt caramel and the smell of coffee you forgot was left on for half the day. I didn’t give it a chance to develop (it had potential to improve, I suspect) because it made me queasy. GETITOFFFFF. Very strong. 1/5 

**The Ghost Wants a Birthday Cake**- *”Warm peach cake, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, vanilla bean ice cream, Indian mysore sandalwood, Australian sandalwood”* This one is smooth and I struggle to pick out notes. The cardamom is one I can detect, probably ginger, but wouldn’t without a cheat sheet. Peach, no. Nonspecifically sweet and gently spicy is the overall effect. As I wear it, I start to dislike it but I could not really say why. Moderate strength and longevity (oil). 2/5

HEXENNACHT

**Leopardite**- *“mysore sandalwood, golden sandalwood powder, vanilla husk, chamois accord, Alaskan cedarwood, tobacco leaf, black oak, cardamom, saffron threads, miel blanc”* Dear god, please get this off my skin. Scrubber. It is straight up cat pee on me, which I assume is the honey note, despite it being listed last. Strong AF. 0/5

**Le Chat Noir**- *“Chimney smoke, freshly fallen snow, and the cool, dry, musky scent of a cat just in from a long winter stroll.”* Aquatic with what I assume is a smoke accord but smells leathery to me. Both aspects are potent. It does settle down a little as it dries, and a friendlier soft musk comes out as the smoke and sharp aquatic dissipates, but not for me. 2/5

**Blue Moon**- *blue musk, grapefruit, neroli, night air accord, lime peel*. On paper this is relevant to my interests. On skin, it is a POTENT acrid artificial smelling lime. Scrubbing time!  0/5

**Oranjulius**- *”orange juice, sugar syrup.”* A fantastic juicy and bright orange blend, which I am entirely here for… with a whiff  of vomit. Goddamn it. That milk note is in this. The vomitous milk note first amps, and then (thankfully) dies down… alas, so does the orange, as it tends to do. 3/5

**The Overlook Hotel**-*”white spruce, sugared vanilla, buttermint candies”* Lots of chilly mint, the spruce is mild but present. The vanilla is a lighter variety. The mint burns off pretty fast (as it does) leaving nice snowy winter scent, not men’s cologne-y at all! (I had really missed having one of these around for rare occasions.) Pretty strong initially, short lived however. 4/5

OVERALL:
First time trying Sorce and I’m very impressed. I think their more floral works are where I’m going to be happiest, which is a surprise! But I do LOVE certain florals with gourmand aspects (Dolce and Gabbana Devotion, Love Don’t Be Shy by Kilian, Flowerbomb.) 

I love the small and curated nature of their catalogue. BLESS. They definitely create complex, fully realized perfumes with top, middle, and heart notes taken into account. More… adult… I guess is the word (although I kind of hate to say it) than some of the OG indie houses. 

Also first try with Hexennacht. Unfortunately most of what I sniffed wasn’t up my alley. I have a bunch of samples that I opened but didn’t try on skin yet (Ajevie is GREAT!) So far I am impressed with how potent they are, especially compared to current BPAL strength. I especially don’t vibe with their milk/cream accord- it smells very butyric to me- and unfortunately a lot of my samples have it.",7,1738801044.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,0.89,False

I closed my eyes and prayed/spoke with them making sure to stated with all the respect i have i only wish to speak with love and respect. I was then drawn to use my tarot deck. I drew my cards, got the messages behind them and said thank you for the message and for speaking with me. I then felt drawn to make an offering. I dont have much and am in a bad finical position but felt drawn to pour some coffee in a very specific mug. I dont have an alter set up but i cleared and cleaned a shelf off my bookshelf to dedicate to my now alter. I Then said thank you again, and while pouring the coffee into the mug i said ""I pour this as an offering to Skadi, in thanks."" then set it on the space i cleared off. Is there anything i should have or could do differrent in the future? I am very new to norse paganism but i have read a lot of it is intuition.

1iiowdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/WirelessHeadphonesHub/comments/1iiowdq/bose_8843671100_quietcomfort_wireless_headphones/,Bose 884367-1100 QuietComfort wireless headphones review: worth the buzz?,"Testing the Bose 884367-1100 QuietComfort headphones has been quite the experience. I’ve worn them during long workdays, chaotic commutes, and even while attempting to tune out my neighbor’s DIY projects. These wireless Bluetooth headphones stand out with their active noise-cancelling capabilities, and I can confidently say they’re a reliable companion for audiophiles and casual listeners alike. However, perfection is elusive, and while these headphones are impressive, they do come with a few quirks.

Sound quality is where these headphones shine brightest. The audio is rich, with deep bass that doesn’t feel overpowering, complementing crisp treble and well-balanced mids. Listening to orchestral music, I could pick up on subtle instrument layers that my previous headphones seemed to gloss over. For pop and rock, the bass really punches through, making it feel like a miniature concert in your ears. I’ve even tested it with podcasts, and voices come across as clear and natural.

[Check Bose QuietComfort price on Amazon here.](https://wirelessemporium.com/product-reviews/bose-884367-1100-review-b0d4z9c562/)

Fit and comfort were surprisingly good for extended usage. The plush earcups felt like clouds hugging my ears, and the padded band didn’t dig into my head, even after a four-hour binge-watching session. I’ve got sensitive ears, so finding headphones that don’t leave me tender after long use is a big win. My younger cousin, who has a slightly larger head, also tried them and remarked on how adjustable and snug they felt.

Battery life is a standout feature here. Bose promises up to 24 hours on a single charge, and I’ve found that to be pretty accurate. I used them consistently for a few days before needing a recharge. Charging them takes around 2.5 hours, and a quick 15-minute top-up provides about 2.5 hours of listening time. That came in handy when I forgot to charge them before a flight. The USB-C charging is a plus, and the inclusion of a wired option with their 3.5 mm to 2.5 mm audio cable adds versatility.

Connectivity is another area where the Bose QuietComfort headphones excel. Pairing them with my phone, laptop, and tablet was a breeze, thanks to multipoint Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity. Switching between devices felt seamless, sparing me the headache of constant reconnecting. The Bluetooth range extends to about 30 feet, so I could leave my phone on the kitchen counter while moving around the house without losing connection.

Noise cancellation is where Bose continues to set industry standards. The active noise cancellation (ANC) effectively eliminated background distractions, from the hum of my air conditioner to the drone of a bustling coffee shop. Their Quiet and Aware Modes are easy to toggle between, allowing me to switch from total immersion to being aware of my surroundings with a simple button press. However, the faint white noise that accompanies the ANC might irritate those with sensitive hearing.

The touch controls and features are intuitive, though they took a day or two to get used to. Adjusting volume, pausing tracks, or accessing voice assistants like Siri and Google was straightforward enough. A standout feature for me was the Spotify Tap, which made resuming my playlists or podcasts ridiculously convenient. Customization via the Bose Music app enhanced the experience, but I did encounter minor glitches with the app when switching devices rapidly.

Durability-wise, these headphones feel sturdy yet lightweight. The materials, including leather and plastic, seem designed to withstand daily use without being overly bulky. The foldable design and carrying case make them easy to store and transport. I’ve even worn them during light rain (not recommended) and sweaty gym sessions, and their water resistance held up well. However, they’re not fully waterproof, so don’t go swimming with them.

**Pros**

1. Outstanding sound quality with customizable EQ.
2. Comfortable fit for extended wear.
3. Exceptional battery life and quick charge capability.
4. Effective noise cancellation with adjustable modes.
5. Multipoint Bluetooth connectivity for seamless transitions.

**Cons**

1. Slight white noise with ANC might bother some users.
2. The accompanying app can be finicky at times.
3. Premium pricing might deter budget-conscious buyers.
4. Limited waterproof capabilities.
5. Ear cups could feel slightly warm after long sessions.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Comparing these headphones to popular competitors like the Sony WH-1000XM5 and Apple AirPods Max, the QuietComfort stands tall in terms of comfort and sound quality. The Sony WH-1000XM5 edges out slightly in noise cancellation, though the Bose offers a more balanced sound profile. Apple’s AirPods Max deliver a premium build and immersive spatial audio, but they’re significantly heavier and lack multi-device connectivity. For those prioritizing comfort and versatility, the Bose wins hands down.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The Bose QuietComfort headphones are undoubtedly a premium product. While they’re priced similarly to high-end competitors, their features and performance justify the investment for most users. If you’re someone who values sound quality, effective noise cancellation, and comfort, they’re worth considering. Waiting for a sale or discounts might make the deal even sweeter, especially for those hesitant about the price tag.

These headphones incorporate every possible feature a user might need. From the adjustable EQ to Spotify Tap and multipoint connectivity, Bose has thought of it all. Whether you’re a frequent traveler, a remote worker, or just someone who loves immersive sound, these headphones cater to a wide range of needs.

2 days ago, I made a [Reddit post on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1igr1sp/how_does_my_ui_look_for_a_minimalist_task/)of my project’s backend UI and to my surprise, I received tons of amazing feedback. 

I have built >10 different SaaS projects, but none of them were successful. So I started building a project for myself for a pain point that I have. 

As mentioned, since I have several projects up and running, it started getting very hard for me to maintain them and keep track of their progresses. Tools like JIRA, Trello, Asana, etc seemed a bit overkill for small projects like mine. This project is built specifically for this purpose, to keep track of small tasks and have all the project related details in one single page. 

Anyway, after seeing so many people interested in this project, I decided to go ahead with a soft launch: https://swiftboard.dev/ 🚀

In the early hours of March 13, 1974, the tranquility of Lisbon's pre-dawn streets was shattered by the rumble of approaching tanks and trucks. General António de Spínola's rebel armed forces had unexpectedly overthrown the struggling Estado Novo government in a coup d'état, which the sleeping population was unaware of. The well-planned rebellion sought to take control of important capital installations and declare the end of almost fifty years of authoritarian control.

Despite months of simmering tensions in the barracks, Prime Minister Adriano Moreira's government was caught completely off guard by the unexpected putsch. Following his expulsion in 1973 due to increasingly public conflicts with Lisbon regarding the conduct of the colonial wars, Spínola, the former military governor of Portuguese Guinea, had become a vociferous critic of the regime's stubbornness in Africa. The officer corps was deeply resentful of his forced withdrawal from Guinea to make room for a desperate transfer of soldiers to support deteriorating positions in Angola and Mozambique.
Spínola first withdrew to the political periphery and wrote scathing broadsides in military magazines criticising the war's expenses and pointlessness. However, he was persuaded that only decisive action could end the political stalemate in Lisbon when government forces in Mozambique suffered devastating defeats in the face of a combined Tanzanian-FRELIMO attack in late 1973. Together with General Francisco da Costa Gomes, an influential opposition figure within the regime, Spínola began discreetly sounding out key commanders on their willingness to move against the government. The plot was finally sparked by Tanzanian armor's crushing defeat of the strategically important port city of Nacala in December. Rebel officers concurred in heated conclaves during the Christmas break that the point of no return had been crossed. The next dry season offensive would inevitably bring about the complete collapse of the African empire if the bleeding in Mozambique could not be stopped. The plotters' determination was strengthened by the terrifying possibility of a second Goa, this time on a continental scale. Early in the spring, a coup was planned to overthrow the government and free Portugal from its imperial morass.

Spínola and his supporters laboured feverishly behind the scenes to prepare the groundwork in the months preceding the putsch. While inconspicuous feelers were sent out to the democratic opposition, trusted officers were planted into strategic commands. Comprehensive backup preparations were created for the installation of a temporary administration and a decolonisation framework. With Spínola personally travelling the nation to assess and inflame regimental anti-government sentiment, special attention was paid to ensuring the allegiance of the army troops ringing Lisbon.
In addition to laying the political foundation, rebel units secretly accumulated supplies, ammunition, and fuel. Using coded messages hidden in late-night music broadcasts and short-wave radios, safe homes were set up and a complex communications network was put together. In order to reduce the possibility of leaks or detection, Spínola, a skilled covert operative from his Guinea days, insisted on meticulous compartmentalisation and a staged disclosure of objectives.

The tense waiting game between Spínola and the increasingly apprehensive Moreira government reached a crescendo as winter gave way to spring. The rebel general had to shorten his schedule since there were rumours that he was about to take action against the regime. He put the plot into action irrevocably on the morning of March 13th by sending a brief coded communication to all provincial commanders that said, ""The operation is a go.""
Rebel units led by the prestigious Cavalry School started meeting up on the outskirts of Lisbon shortly after midnight. At the same time, in a traditional pincer movement on the city, armoured columns led by Spínola confidantes thundered out of depots in Santarém and Setúbal. To cut off the regime's communications with the outside world, highly skilled commandos were airdropped to take control of the international airport, state radio and television station, and telephone exchange. Before the day's first coffee, a special operations team in Lisbon seized the DGS secret police's Baixa headquarters in a rapid raid, seizing the infamous citadel. As the rebels advanced, government ministries, police stations, and newspaper offices all fell in quick succession around the city. The invasion was so swift and unexpected that isolated loyalist retainers were soon cut off and compelled to surrender.

The most spectacular events took place at the government seat, São Bento Palace. Spínola and Costa Gomes entered the building with an armed escort and requested Moreira's resignation as rebel tanks positioned themselves on the square outside. The prime minister, whose power was eroding minute by minute, made a fleeting attempt to temporise. However, Moreira had little option because all escape routes were closed and his DGS bodyguards were nowhere to be found. With a shaking signature, he consented to dissolve his administration during a tense forty-minute standoff that was broken by the sound of distant gunfire.

By dawn on March 13th, all strategic targets were under rebel control, and areas of opposition were being cleared out. To the surprise of many, the security forces' feared divisions turned out to be paper tigers, vanishing in the face of the revolutionary juggernaut with hardly a shot fired. The DGS's inactivity was possibly the biggest shock. After terrorising people for years, the secret police slunk shamefully from the historical stage. Its rank-and-file had to deal with the fury of a jubilant populace after the majority of its top executives were discovered to have left the nation.
Ecstatic masses flocked to the streets to celebrate the overthrow of the despised government as word of the coup spread throughout the nation. In an impromptu representation of the nonviolent nature of the revolution, bright yellow flowers that had been picked from city gardens were placed within the barrels of rebel rifles and tanks. Huge unplanned gatherings broke out in Porto, Coimbra, and other large cities to express support with the new Lisbon government. As colonial officials and settler communities grappled with the dizzying shift in urban politics, the response was more subdued but no less electrifying throughout the other parts of the empire.

On the morning of March 14, Spínola stated on national television that a seven-member Junta of National Salvation would be established to supervise the democratic transition. Costa Gomes was a member of the new ruling council, which pledged to hold free elections by the end of the year and to quickly abolish the authoritarian apparatus. In a move that would have been unimaginable only days earlier, Spínola most dramatically announced the start of unconditional talks with the liberation movements and an immediate ceasefire in Africa. The Junta's first actions were to dissolve the DGS and the Portuguese Legion, freeze the assets of the regime's senior leadership, and begin releasing the thousands of political prisoners languishing in Caxias, Peniche and other notorious jails. The purge of the state apparatus and the dismantling of the colonial administration would take longer but it was clear from the outset that there would be no turning back.

Spínola's astute political timing, realising that the catastrophic turn in Africa had created an opportunity for decisive action, was largely responsible for the coup's success. However, equal recognition should go to the younger MFA officers who had established a strong covert network directly in front of the authorities. The regime's internal disintegration was made possible by their meticulous planning and strict operational security. In the months to come, Spínola's junta would have to contend with a delicate decolonisation process, an economic catastrophe, and the repressed energies of a society coming out of a half-century of repression.",6,1738799504.0,ColdWarPowers,1,1.0,False

In my last post, I mentioned that I was expecting my Dapoxetine shipment and asked about experiences with Zoloft and Fluoxetine on demand. I haven't tried. Over the past few weeks, I also experimented with Xanax, but I had major issues achieving an erection. I barely managed, but overall, it was a complete failure, and I regretted taking Xanax in the first place.

Before I get into my experience, here are a few quick facts about me:

* My PE has gotten so bad that now I finish within 5 to 10 seconds, at most.
* My refractory period is extremely long, and this issue has started ruining my relationship since I’m basically incapable of going for a second round. I assume this is stress-related rather than a physical problem.
* I’m 22 years old.
* There have been times when I finished during foreplay, and even when that doesn’t happen, I constantly feel like I’m on the verge.
* Occasionally, I take Cialis (5-10mg) about 6 hours before sex on an empty stomach.

I started doubting myself, losing confidence, and honestly, even slipping into depression. My partner has been incredibly understanding, and we’ve managed to find ways to satisfy each other, but the lack of penetrative sex has taken such a toll that we’ve both almost forgotten what real sex feels like.

Before my Dapoxetine arrived, I read every single (and I mean EVERY) post about it on this subreddit, so I had a general idea of what to expect.

# First Try – The Worst Experience Ever

The day before my girlfriend was supposed to come over, I decided to test Dapoxetine for the first time just to simulate the feeling I am going to expect the next day. And let me tell you, IT FELT HORRIBLE. A thousand times worse than people described.

I took half a pill (30mg), along with 10mg of Cialis, just to simulate the conditions for the next day. I already have issues with Cialis lowering my blood pressure, but I’ve gotten used to it. I took both pills at the same time on an empty stomach.

At one point, I felt like I was about to pass out. I was dizzy, disoriented, and could barely walk straight. Full-blown panic attack, convulsions—I had no idea where I was and genuinely thought I was going to die. My anxiety was through the roof, I was sweating bullets, and I started mumbling nonsense. People around me were freaking out. It took me 8 hours to recover.

On top of that, the nausea was unbearable. I felt like I was seconds away from throwing up the entire time. Words can’t describe how awful it was. Now I understand the people who said they’d never take it again after experiencing this.

# Second Try – Game Changer

The next day, I changed my approach. I took 30mg of Dapoxetine with a full meal (some people suggest light food, but I had three slices of pizza—so you decide if that counts as light). I also took 5mg of Cialis about 4-5 hours beforehand.

This time, I took Dapoxetine 1.5 hours before sex, and I was really worried that it wouldn't kick in at the proper time. But at that point, I had nothing to lose and figured I probably wouldn’t even be able to get hard anyway.

Since I’ve taken Xanax and other meds before, the feeling was similar to a typical SSRI. But this time, I had almost NO SIDE EFFECTS except for mild nausea. I was fully functional, just slightly spaced out, but it was manageable.

During foreplay, I still felt like I was on the edge, and I was convinced the pill wasn’t working. But when I started penetration, I initially thought I was going to finish in seconds—then suddenly, that feeling disappeared.

Sex lasted nearly **20 minutes.**

At one point, it hit me—I was having **actual sex** and had full control over my body. On top of that, my erection was solid, and I felt like I could last as long as I wanted. I didn’t even finish during the first round because I got too tired.

During the second round, I had to slow down a bit because I was getting overwhelmed with excitement. By that time, I think the Dapoxetine had already started wearing off, because I began feeling like I was about to finish again.

The orgasm itself was weird. Right before ejaculating, I felt a strange tickling sensation on the tip of my penis. For a second, I thought I had already finished inside my partner because I wasn’t fully in control—definitely a bizarre experience. I'd highly recommend **using a condom**, just in case.

Afterwards, I was the happiest guy alive. I noticed that it took me longer than usual to fall asleep, and I could still feel the effects of the pill the next day. There’s no way I would ever take **60mg**—not just because of the side effects, but because I probably wouldn’t even be able to finish.

# Interesting Observations

I gave a pill to a 40-year-old friend, and for some reason, it didn’t work for him at all. I think he took it the wrong way or didn’t time it properly, but still—just something to keep in mind.

One crazy side effect I had (which one user mentioned) was **uncontrollable anger.** I was **pissed off, irritated, and ready to fight someone**. I ended up channeling that aggression into sex, which worked out fine, but that level of rage was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. The second time I took it, it wasn’t as bad, but the frustration lasted for a few days.

# Key Takeaways

* **DO NOT take it on an empty stomach.** Eat a small meal first.
* **Take an antacid** before the pill to help with nausea.
* **Wait at least 2-3 hours before sex.** Some say even 4 hours, i totally agree, so be patient.
* **Test it alone first.** If I hadn't taken this, I would have had a complete disaster with my partner.
* **Start with 30mg.** You can always test it while masturbating to gauge the effects.
* **Consider taking a low dose of Cialis (5-10mg)** to ensure good erections.
* **Be ready for nausea**—maybe drink tea to help.
* **Use a condom** to avoid that weird lack of control over ejaculation.
* **Avoid alcohol.**
* **Drink coffee or an energy drink** to counteract the apathy caused by Dapoxetine.
* **Since both Dapoxetine and Cialis lower blood pressure,** have something salty to eat and drink caffeine to stabilize it.
* **Be prepared for possible anger and mood swings.** If it happens, remind yourself it’s just the pill messing with you.

I live in Serbia, where this drug isn’t officially available in pharmacies. The only way to get it is through illegal sites, and the only version here is the **Indian Dapoxetine HCL** (not Priligy).

# Final Thoughts

If you’re struggling with PE, I highly recommend trying it. This has been a life-changing discovery for me.

**Max dosage: 60mg per 24 hours** (but I wouldn’t recommend it). The drug is intense, and you can feel its impact on your body. I wouldn’t take it more than 2-3 times a week since it takes several days to fully recover.

Next time, I’m sticking with 30mg—no need to risk it with 60mg yet. If you’re older, you might want to go straight to 60mg, but be aware of the higher risk of side effects and potential erectile dysfunction.

I'll let you know my thoughts on Friday, after I try it again.

I went into work and foolishly only drank black coffee throughout the day without water.

I felt fine until I was ready to leave work and went to pee (the only time I went to the washroom). 

Soon after, I started feeling very dizzy and like I was going to faint. It was so scary.

I went to grab a gatrorade and drank the whole bottle and got myself home. I took a spoonful of table salt with water at home and I am finally feeling much better.

I have never felt like this before and this was hands down one of the scariest experiences…

I ordered magnesium supplement, nu salt (for potassium) and will take them going forward with table salt for the electrolytes.

If there are any recommendations to prevent the feeling of faint during fasting, I would really appreciate to hear. TIA! ",14,1738799322.0,fasting,9,1.0,False

Gregory stands in front of a messy bulletin board covered with newspaper clippings, red string connecting various photos, and a giant, bold title: “Black Mask Still on the run” He rubs his temples, pacing in his tiny apartment, talking to himself as he tries to piece together his next move.

Gregory: (Muttering)  Greg, think… Where would a criminal mastermind named ""Black Mask"" hide? Casino? Warehouse? Evil villain lair? (pause) Do people even have those in real life? Or is that just a Batman thing?

He squints at a blurry security cam photo of Black Mask.

Gregory: Okay, this Mother fucker  framed me eight months ago. Robbed First National Bank, vanished into thin air, and left *me* to take the fall. Classic villain move. Real original, buddy. But if I were him… where would I go now?

He dramatically spins in his chair, stops, then immediately spins again for no reason

Gregory then snaps his Finger

Gregory: Shit Of course the docks  The *criminal hot spot*! Every shady guy in movies goes to the docks. It’s like, a law or something. I bet if I just go down there and yell, “Hey, anybody seen a dude in a Black Mask?” someone will immediately try to shoot me

He pauses, realising something

Gregory: Okay, maybe not my best plan. Let’s… let’s rethink.

He slumps onto his couch and stares at the ceiling, then grabs a notepad and writes Step 1 Find the Black Mask

Gregory: (deadpan) Wow, Gregory. Genius strategy. Why don’t I just add Step 2 fuck him up badly Step 3 live happily ever after while im at it

He then plans heading out until he thinks

Gregory:  Ugh. But if I go out looking like *this*, that Agent Landings *di*ckhead\* will spot me in two seconds. That guy’s like a bloodhound, except instead of sniffing for justice, he just sniffs for ways to ruin my life.

He glances around his apartment, searching for a disguise. He grabs a baseball cap and sunglasses, then looks in the mirror

Gregory: (mockingly) ""Oh wow, who is this mysterious and totally unrecognisable man? Certainly *not* Gregory, the guy we’ve been hunting for months!

He immediately throws the sunglasses aside and digs through his closet. Pulls out a fake moustache, puts it on, and squints at himself in the mirror.

Gregory: Hmm… Too “I sell used condoms  on Craigslist.

Tosses it. Grabs a hoodie and pulls the hood up, then strikes a dramatic pose.

Gregory: Now I just look like I’m about to rob a gas station. Not helpful

He grabs his keys, takes a deep breath, and heads for the door

Gregory: Time to find this Cunt … and hope I don’t run into Captain Pain-in-My-Ass Landings along the way

The Scene cuts to Jeremy  and Bruce Apartment

Bruce:  Alright, babe, I’m heading to work. And just so you know, I’m taking the second half of the shepherd’s pie in the fridge. You can have the other half

Jeremy:  (nodding, half-awake) Okay, babe.

Bruce: See ya babe

Bruce gives Jeremy a quick kiss on the cheek, grabs his keys, and struts out the door. The moment the door shuts, Jeremy immediately drops the casual boyfriend act and goes into full secret-villain mode               He steps into his office—a dimly lit, suspiciously well-organized space with monitors tracking Gregory’s movements. He opens a drawer, pulls out the infamous black mask, and slides it on. His voice drops an octave, taking on a menacing tone.

Black Mask: Hm… so, you’ve come searching for me, once more  Gregory. How *cute*. Like a lost little puppy sniffing around for a bone… only this bone is *gonna break you in half*

He dramatically turns toward the monitors, watching Gregory bumbling around in his ridiculous disguise. Jeremy smirks, enjoying himself until the doorbell rings

Jeremy’s eyes widen. Panic sets in. He *rips off* the mask and shoves it into a drawer, composing himself just as Bruce opens the door

Bruce: (Grumbles) I forgot my keys again

Bruce pauses, noticing Jeremy looks suspicious as hell slightly out of breath, standing weirdly still, like a kid caught doing something shady

Bruce: What the hell are you doing?

Jeremy clears his throat, thinking fast

Jeremy: Im writing a novel

Bruce: A novel?

Jeremy:  Yep. It’s an *LGBTQ Power Rangers* novel. Super deep. Explores identity, colours, and—um—*megazords of the soul*.

Bruce: Aw thats pretty sweet

Jeremy breathes a silent sigh of relief.

Bruce:  grabbing keys) Anyway, have fun with your little *gay ranger fanfic*, babe. I gotta go yell at a customer who thinks box dye is the same as salon color.

Bruce gives him a peck on the lips and struts off again. Jeremy waits until he hears the front door shut before exhaling dramatically and wiping imaginary sweat off his forehead.  He slowly turns back toward the drawer where the mask is hidden, smirking to himself.

Jeremy: *Megazords of the soul…?* Yeah, that bullshit  a stretch even for me.

The Scene Cuts to the docks

Lusso stands with his arms crossed, looking like he eats bricks for breakfast. Gregory takes a deep breath and sneaks forward

Lusso: You know i can hear you right?

Gregory: ( Whispers to himself) Fuck

Lusso turns around, towering over Gregory like a fridge with a face.

Lusso: What do you want?

Gregory clenches his fists dramatically, takes a fighting stance

Gregory: Justice

and punches Lusso square in the gut.Nothing happens. It’s like punching a concrete wall Beat. Silence. Gregory stares at his fist. Lusso stares at Gregory. Then

Gregory: (Pained) Aaaaah Shit shit

Gregory’s arm makes a horrifying sound as he recoils, clutching it in agony

Gregory: (Screaming) Oh My god Aaaaah  i just broke my hand

Lusso watches, unimpressed, as Gregory hops around in pain

Lusso: (mocking) What, you thought you were in a movie? Thought you’d land a punch, I’d go,Oof!” and spill all my secrets?

Gregory: (Whimpering) That was the plan

Gregory, still wincing, straightens up and glares at Lusso

Gregory: Tell me where the Black Mask is

Lusso: He's right here

Gregory: Where!?

Lusso: Its you obviously

He bursts out laughing at his own joke. Gregory’s face twitches in rage

Gregory: (Deadpan)  Ha. That’s *so* funny. You should do stand-up. Oh wait, you *won’t* be able to

Gregory swings at Lusso’s gun, aiming to disarm him. Instead, he somehow manages to crack Gregory's other arm is broken

Gregory: (High pitched scream) Are you fucking kidding me!?

Lusso watches, barely holding back laughter

Lusso: Man you really suck at this shit

Gregory, now looking like a T-Rex with two useless arms, glares up at Lusso, panting in pain

Gregory: (Desperate) Just tell me where the Black mask is the guy who framed me!

Lusso: Even if i did i wouldn't tell you

Gregory;s eye twitches then With no other options left, he awkwardly maneuvers his broken arms and pulls out his blaster using his mouth, somehow managing to aim it at Lusso’s head (*Lusso barely has time to react before Bang head shot!*

*Gregory: See that was Plan B ... Asshole.*

Agent Landings is seen going crazy over the Black Mask releasing his true Parasite self once more

Agent Landings: Gregory is the Black Mask just look at his Posture  i know it just look at the way he breathes It screams Criminal Master Mind!

FBI Agent 1: (Whispering) Dude, has Landings been acting… weird lately?

FBI Agent 2: Oh, *you* noticed? Yeah, he’s been *feral* ever since that bank job eight months ago.

Meanwhile, Landings continues his unhinged breakdown—now aggressively pacing, hands in his hair, muttering like a parasite has taken over his brain

Agent Landings: e thinks he’s so smart. Disguising himself. Running around like a ghost. But I *See You, Gregory* See You. You may be out there, *hiding*… but I’m Hunting You

FBI Agent 3: You think he's okay?

FBI Agent 2: Eh probably still thinking about his Divorce

FBI Agent 1: Poor Guy

Back to Landings, who is now frantically pinning more random photos to his conspiracy board—one of Gregory, one of Black Mask, and for some reason… a blurry picture of Nicolas Cage

FBI Agent 3: Why is there a picture of Nicolas cage here?

Agent Landings: (snaps around) Because He's  a Man Of Mystery  A Master Of Disguise. Like Gregory

Agent Landings, breathing heavily, eyes twitching. He slams his hands down on the desk dramatically, looking around the room like a deranged detective on the verge of a breakthrough

Agent Landings: (quietly) …Oh. Hey, Cheryl. No, I didn’t forget it’s my weekend with the kids… (*long sigh*) No, I *wasn’t* yelling… Okay, *maybe* I was…

His agents stare as their boss—the *rabid, obsessed, borderline insane* man who just declared a *blood feud* with Gregory suddenly turns into a tired, divorced dad dealing with custody drama

FBI Agent 2: Divorce really hits different

The Scene cuts to Jeremy in his room

Jeremy, still in his cosy apartment office, now back in full Black Mask mode, sits in front of his high-tech monitors, scrolling through security footage. He sips a glass of expensive wine, pinky up because even villains deserve class. Suddenly, a notification pops up

Black Mask: Dammit, Gregory. You *really* killed Lusso? That man was built like a truck and had *great* taste in cigars. You don’t find that combo every day

He leans back, taking another sip of wine, then shrugs.

Black Mask: (Sighs) Time for Plan C

He presses a button on his desk. The camera cuts to a secret underground facility where dozens of sleek, high-tech drones small but armed with mini-missiles—begin activating. Red lights blink

Gregory, still looking like an absolute wreck, is limping away from Lusso’s corpse, holding his now double-broken arms like a human pretzel. He’s muttering to himself, regretting every life choice that led to this moment

Gregory: I swear if I break *one more bone* tonight, I’m suing *someone*.

Then a loud buzzing sound is heard

Gregory stops. Looks up. Sees a swarm of drones flying in his direction, armed to the teeth with mini-missiles.

Gregory: Oh shit This *B* definitely has *Black Mask* written *all over it.*

The drones suddenly fire missiles.

Gregory runs and screams as the missiles chase him

Citizen 1: Holy shit its an invasion

Citizen 2: (Crying) I knew the robots we're going to turn on us

A woman immediately throws her entire iced coffee into the air. A man flips a hot dog cart for no reason. Somewhere, a car alarm starts blaring. Pure chaos

Gregory is still running, looking over his shoulder

Gregory: Why are they shooting so many missiles at one guy?

The police sirens start blaring. Officers pull up, stepping out with guns drawn

Police Officer: You hands in the air!

Gregory: Dude my arms are literally broken

And even more cop cars and even an FBI Car comes too

Cue Agent Landings, kicking open the car door, looking absolutely deranged. His tie is crooked, his hair is a mess, and he looks like a man who has been running on rage and vending machine coffee.

Agent Landings: (screaming) Got you black Mask

Gregory stares at him, dead inside.

Gregory: Of course you'd show up right now

Meanwhile, Jeremy (Black Mask) is watching the whole thing from his monitors, sipping his wine, laughing his ass off

Black Mask: This shit is so much better than reality TV

Jeremy, still in full Black Mask mode, is gleefully watching Gregory run for his damn life on the monitors while sipping his fancy wine. The explosions, the screaming, the sheer chaos it’s all going perfectly

Then his Phone rings the id caller is Bruce

*Jeremy* chokes on his wine\*\*\*.\*\*\* Panicked, he rips off the Black Mask and clears his throat before answering

Jeremy: Uh hey babe

Bruce: (Suspicious)

Jeremy: (fake laugh) *Weird?* Me? Pffft nahhh, just, um… *busy!*

*Jeremy glances at the monitor, where Gregory is currently dodging missiles and screaming bloody murder.* The FBI and police are in absolute *chaos.* Jeremy grimaces and quickly turns the volume down before Bruce hears it.

Bruce: (Scoffs) Busy Busy doing what?

Jeremy: (panicking) Uh… *work!* Yep. Just… *work things.* You know, *emails… spreadsheets… murder drones…*—*I mean, reports! Regular, boring reports!*

Bruce: (Deadpan) Right work

I know a lot of what I wrote resounds with what I read here, as a longtime lurker and non-commenter. I just wanted to share this list with you because all of your lists, observations and insights have helped me so much, to know I’m not alone. Hardly anyone knows about my choice to take Z, I usually just say “I’ve been working with my doctor and making lifestyle changes” and leave it at that. #2, #4 and #13 were the biggest surprises for me.  I am looking forward to maintenance - just a little bit more to go! It’s been a wild 9 months!  Hang in there, you can do it. :)

TL;DR: my question is this: for those who either can't handle, or don't drink, caffeine, and are desk-bound, how do you stay focused* through a full shift? 

*Edited to add that I don't think I have any more difficulty staying awake than most people stuck at a desk for 8 hours, just that most people I know have a steady supply of coffee, Coke, tea, etc, and I've always had a bottle of Diet Mt Dew beside me. 

My WFH  job is at a desk and it's all talkie-talkie and typie-typie, so I am pretty well tethered for the most part, except for scheduled 15-min breaks and 30-min lunch. 

Background: I have some health issues, primarily cardiac in this case, and I have a feeling that in the morning my cardiologist is going to tell me that I'm going to have to give up, or at least cut way back on, caffeine.

I've been playing around with a homemade electrolyte mix, and I really like it, but the sodium level is atrocious.

So I'm open to anything that works for y'all. I've had one friend suggest B-complex, and that's my starting point. Any help is welcome. ",3,1738798903.0,workfromhome,6,0.8,False

From bizarre pet projects to luxury splurges, here are the craziest government expenditures that DOGE uncovered in the last month:

# 1. $2.3 Million for a Study on Whether Cats Prefer Zoom Calls Over FaceTime

Because inquiring minds (apparently within the government) need to know if Mittens likes a crisp HD video call or the smooth interface of FaceTime. *(Source: Government Research Grants Report, 2024)*

# 2. $750,000 for the Development of a Scented Air for Mars Colonies

Because future astronauts might miss the smell of fresh-cut grass, the government invested three-quarters of a million dollars into creating an artificial scent to make Mars feel more like home. *(Source: NASA Budget Allocation, 2024)*

# 3. $5 Million on a Gold-Plated Conference Table for a Remote-Work Department

In a stunning move of bureaucratic irony, a department responsible for promoting remote work spent millions on an extravagant in-person meeting table… that remains mostly unused. *(Source: Federal Procurement Database, 2024)*

# 4. $1.2 Million for a Reality Show About Bureaucracy

Titled *Paperwork Wars*, this government-funded reality series follows civil servants battling red tape. Unfortunately, after six weeks of paperwork delays, production never started. *(Source: Public Broadcasting Grant Reports, 2024)*

# 5. $400,000 for a Research Project on Whether Ducks Enjoy Classical Music

Mozart or Beethoven? The government spent nearly half a million dollars to settle this avian debate once and for all. *(Source: National Science Foundation Grants, 2024)*

# 6. $1.8 Million for a Study on the Psychological Effects of Losing at Rock-Paper-Scissors

Apparently, the agony of defeat in a game of chance required a multi-million-dollar deep dive into human emotions. *(Source: Department of Mental Health Studies, 2024)*

# 7. $3.5 Million on Training Pigeons to Deliver WiFi Signals

Dubbed “Project Bird-Fi,” this ambitious (and doomed) effort sought to use pigeons as mobile internet hotspots. Reports indicate that the pigeons mostly flew away. *(Source: Technology and Infrastructure Funding Report, 2024)*

# 8. $900,000 for a National Museum of Unfinished Government Projects

Ironically, funding for this museum was abruptly cut, leaving it as the latest addition to its own exhibit. *(Source: Department of Cultural Affairs, 2024)*

# 9. $2 Million for Research on Whether Politicians Blink Less Than Regular People

A groundbreaking study aimed to determine if politicians are, in fact, human. Results remain inconclusive. *(Source: Political Science Research Fund, 2024)*

# 10. $650,000 on an AI-Powered Coffee Maker That Writes Speeches

This high-tech machine was meant to help politicians craft better public addresses. However, it mostly just generated Shakespearean sonnets about caffeine. *(Source: Innovation and AI Grant Reports, 2024)*

While government spending is always a topic of debate, these expenditures show that sometimes, truth is stranger than fiction.

But have any studies been able to study the effect fasting *by itself* has on testosterone (in either sex)?

I've done some form of IF for most of my life because I don't feel hungry during the day, anyway (I used to drink coffee with milk, though). Then I heard about the benefits of IF on mood and energy, plus autophagy, so a few years ago I started doing it purposely. I've maintained my already healthy weight by eating a lot during my eating window. I love the effects of IF on my energy levels, which is the main reason I don't want to stop. If I so much as have heavy cream in my green tea, I feel sluggish the rest of the day. 

Problem is, my testosterone is low. This didn't coincide with any change in IF regimen that I can recall. There was a medication change around the time my levels dropped, as well a few stressors, such as doing too much cardio. I'd just like some reassurance that it's extremely unlikely IF is contributing to my low T, right? I really hope it's not. 

I usually do something like 20:4. In the past it was probably closer to 16:8. I often work out fasted, too, I hope that's ok?

I'd also like to try doing 36+ hour fasts now and then to get even more autophagy benefits. That shouldn't negatively affect testosterone, either, I hope?",1,1738798417.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

A man with a brown hat is waiting at a coffee shop with his drink of choice in hand, he sits at a table for two that gives a nice view of the ongoing rain. Suddenly a man dressed in a dark grey trench coat arrives and after ordering and waiting for his own drink, sits adjacent to the other man. 

“You’ve finally arrived, Gary.”said the man with the brown hat. 

“I have come on urgent business, Peter has broken free of one of his shackles.”

“WHAT?!!” He takes a couple glances around at the people looking at him after his shout and lowers his voice. “Where did you hear such an audacious thing?”

“Sir, I got it straight from the council, I rushed over to tell you.” 

“If what you said is true then when will the assimilation happen? Will we inform the people?” The man in the brown hat questioned.

“Tonight at 9 Pm, all watchers must resume post at the tower, even if you are not on duty. And as for the public, it will be a surprise or you could say a miracle.”

“I see, I’ll make my way there then.”

“Yes sir.”

The man in the brown hat moved out the double doors and on to the busy streets of the city. The man’s name was Albert, he was the chief executive watcher of a smaller firm and the one that informed him of tonight’s assimilation was one of his investigators. Today was a big day, today was the day Peter would gain back half of his freedom which would mean the world would be 50 percent happier.

Before the dark times of no happiness there was a being who supplied happiness to the people, his name was Peter. However an evil goddess named adea shackled him to an impenetrable tower and stole all the happiness for herself. Ever since that day humanity has been living in the dark ages without a hopeful soul in sight. However, today would be different.

When Albert finally reached the tower, it was evening, the assimilation was about to start. The earth let out a low rumble and the ground shook. Over the horizon, a cloud of golden fog surrounded the dark and cold atmosphere and started mixing with it. The atmosphere turned into a blue sky with a grey hue, the universe hasn’t been fully cured but finally, people could be happy again.

Clerks and business owners started to enjoy their jobs, mothers and fathers smiled at their children. World hunger had stopped for a moment as people were too happy to feel hunger for just that moment. 

Everyone knew….Peter had returned. The end

I think in the more distant past, I found the Freeze-related groups more relatable.  (If I scan through now, I still do, to an extent, just less so.)  

I've gotten to a point where I don't know what will help me longer term.  With therapists, I either find (i) they'll strike me as an ineffectual fool (thought I was meeting an IFS guy but turns out he does CBT only...seems ""nice"" and while I don't think CBT itself is ""bad"", his vibe was just rather...weak, so to speak), (ii) rejecting (have had a handful of therapists lately give various ""excuses"" as to not try to do therapy with me) (iii) a letdown in one of a few ways...one insisting they're in my network until the 10th or so session (then eventually claiming they're not in my network)...another one seeing me for 4-5 years, and when I started to wonder ""is this helping?"" and they asked, saying basically ""honestly, yeah, I don't know"" (all the while sipping their coffee without ever having had tried to themself focus on whether its been helpful for me).  

With this ""fight mode"" stuff, 1-2 years ago I just started getting tired of understanding others, accepting others, tolerating others, and started cutting out people who I found to be a net negative.  

In the past few weeks, a (now ex-)friend had a rather positive reaction to some current events that I considered completely disgusting (details involve the ""7. No politics"" rule) and hence this person flipped over into ""completely unacceptable human"" zone.  Another (now ex-)friend texted me out of the blue saying he didn't want to be friends anymore (yet had been leaning on me emotionally and support in so many ways over the past few years), which ended up feeling like a complete betrayal and left me feeling very used.  

I actually like my current work situation, though recent stressors are making it a lot harder for me to do as well in it.  (Need to get on that after I finish this post, tbh.)  So I guess this is a bright spot and I'm hoping I can transform the work situation into something better.  Though, some of the co-workers can be a bit stressful for me (not ""technically"" their fault, even though it is frustrating/irritating to me).  

But yeah, it seems like ""the best I can do"" right now is to seek to avoid getting triggered, and focus on my job.  But finding therapy that's going to help seems...futile. Sidenote:

\- [https://www.wired.com/story/therapy-broken-mental-health-challenges/](https://www.wired.com/story/therapy-broken-mental-health-challenges/) cites research claiming at least 5% of people get WORSE in therapy

\- I don't necessarily need to hear ""oh you need to do a trauma-focused modality.""  I haven't tried ALL of them, but I have tried talking to enough people from different modalities to realize that there is a huge percentage of supposed trauma therapists (maybe 80% or more even) who are less ""in the know"" on this stuff than myself, yet its also impossible for me to just step outside of myself and ""do therapy on myself"".  I know/knew some people who decided to become trauma therapists themselves (as one of our mutual teachers/mentors suggested as supposedly the best path to one's own healing), but...I've already felt that I've spent too much time helping other people without being really helped myself -- this wasn't and isn't the path for me.  (If I really think about it, it'd probably have to be $300/session minimum for me to feel positively about that, but...I just don't want to do that.)  

\- I AM open to hearing how you eventually found a therapist who was a good match for you if you had trouble with this.  You can also post about how your found a therapist who clicked with on your first try, might be useful info, but in the back of my mind I'll likely be thinking negative thoughts about you, because... 😂 ...well, yeah, I'm not here to be trying to get help, only to turn around and need to congratulate you for having an easier time at something... 😂

A bit rambly, now, I feel.  But definitely would appreciate some ideas and thoughts from other ""fight""-ers here, esp now that my rage and frustrations that have been up and down over the past days/weeks seems to be taking a little dip, at least for now...",1,1738797966.0,CPTSDFightMode,0,1.0,False
1iio6ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDigitalCircus/comments/1iio6ra/why_are_the_characters_so_vague_about_their_real/,Why are the characters so vague about their real lives?,"We know they forgot their names, but not their memories. 

Going under the theory that the characters all worked for Caine & Abel before entering the game, I find it odd that none of them bring this up or imply that they knew about this game prior to entering it.

For example, when Pomni enters the game, all she says was that she was “trying on some headset,” but she doesn’t mention when, where, or why (for example, “my boss asked me to try on this headset,” or “I was on my coffee break and found this old headset”). And none of the other characters bring up their experiences or the connection they all have (“we were all employees who got sucked into here”) either.

For comparison, in the similarly-premised Black Mirror episode, “USS Callister,” the cookies (AI clones of real people) cover these bases. They know where and what they are and they each mention how they were brought into the game by their boss.  

I can buy, however, that the characters don’t recognize each other despite probably working for the same company. Game companies are pretty big, with long shifts that leave little time for socializing, and the characters probably worked in different departments. Even if they did know each other beforehand, they wouldn’t recognize each other’s avatars and they can’t say their real names to clue the others in. 

Still, you’d think they’d still put two and two together since they should remember what they were doing prior to putting on the headsets. I get that they’re all mentally unstable in various ways and they aren’t all exactly friends do, but…still. Is something stopping them? Is the thought or mention of their old lives too much of an abstraction risk?

Interestingly, something I’ve noticed (though it may all just be a coincidence) is that the characters have only talked about their past lives while their minds were altered or being influenced in some way. Kinger was thinking clearly due to being surrounded by darkness, Gangle was experiencing a boost of confidence due to her new mask, and Ragatha was drunk on stupid sauce.

I used the freezing method on my knife block and on my Keurig. It worked great and killed all the roaches, however, unfortunately, it killed my Keurit at the same time. Now I have a new one, and there were still enough roaches in hidey spots to re-infest the new machine. :/

I had my operation on January 31^(st), so I’m still in recovery and will probably update this in the coming days, but I’ve recorded the first five days to the best of my ability.

Thanks to everyone in this group. I am a longtime reddit lurker but never actually felt the need to make an account until now. Just felt like I needed to share my experiences and support other women. I’m happy to answer any questions. <3

**My Demographic:**

* White cisgender female
* 29 years old
* Single, no kids
* Based in California, USA

**Recovery Must Haves**

* Motrin
* GasX
* Miralax
* Ginger Ale (or other lightly carbonated drink of choice)
* Waterproof Band-Aids
* Sticky shoulder heating pads
* Corded heating pad
* Weighted blanket
* Yogibo NapX Travel Pillow (trust me on this)
* Wool socks
* Throat lozenges
* Menstrual pads
* Ice packs

I knew a long time ago that I wanted to get this operation done, but it never really seemed to be a pressing thing. Sort of an *eventually* rather than a *certainly.* Then Roe was overturned, and then the 2024 Election, and I realized that it was, almost quite literally, now or never.

I found three doctors on the Excel sheet posted to reddit of OB/GYNs within an hours drive of me, and made consultations with all three of them (just in case). I made the appointments on Nov. 6^(th), 2024, and they were all within the first to second week of December. Two were virtual, one was in person.

**Consultation:**

All three appointments were very similar. All three of the doctors, all women, asked me a few questions about why I felt the need to have the surgery. I explained that ever since I was a kid I never felt a need to be a mother, and perhaps I had watched too many videos on an unregulated internet in the 2000s of pregnant women’s bellies undulating from the inside and quickly developed tokophobia (fear of pregnancy).

The doctor I saw in person had never heard of tokophobia before, and actually wrote it down to do some research on it, which endeared me enough to her to entrust her with my care (it also helped that she was located the closest to me).

When they asked about my sexual history, I explained that I was asexual and hadn’t had penetrative sex before. The doctor I saw in person suggested to me that the best kind of birth control was just not having sex, and I had that in the bag. Why not get an IUD? That way I would be on birth control and not get my period anymore, either. I explained that I felt worried about the current way the United States was going, and it would be one less thing for me to worry about if, god forbid, things get *really* Handmaids Tale. An IUD could be forcibly removed from me. I wanted something permanent. I could tell one of them didn't *quite* agree with my reasoning but none of them told me I was wrong for being worried about it.

All three doctors explained what a bilateral salpingectomy was and what they would be doing: inserting a camera through my naval, then making two incisions in the juncture where my leg meets torso, and then cut out the fallopian tubes with a special tool that would cauterize as it cut. I wouldn’t be able to keep my tubes, but at least my risk for ovarian cancer would drop by 9%, supposedly.

None of the doctors gave me the “what about your husband?” talk. They did all suggest the IUD, but none questioned it when I affirmed I wanted something permanent.

I signed a document that basically said that I can’t sue them for doing the surgery if I do end up regretting it, and then I left.

I walked out of my consultation terrified to all hell… after all, saying you’re going to do something and then actually doing it were two different things. I had a small anxiety attack in the car afterwards, but the consultation was done, and the admin nurse told me she’d call to schedule the surgery date.

**Pre-Op**

I had to wait 30 days after the consultation before I could have the surgery. The second week of January, I got a call from the office again to confirm I still wanted to go through with it. Many long talks with my mom and sister and therapist later, I confirmed that I was still doing it. The surgery date was scheduled for January 31^(st) at 1:45 pm.

I didn’t have an in-person Pre-Op, really. I had a long phone call with a nurse who explained what I needed to do (and not do) in the week leading up to the surgery, and then got a document emailed to me with it all summarized:

I couldn’t eat or drink after midnight the night before the surgery. I was told to shower the morning of; I had seen some posts on here about being given antibacterial soap to use, but I didn’t have that so I went out and bought some for myself. Take off all jewelry and wear baggy clothes. No alcohol for a full week before.

I got as many chores done as I could: did all my laundry, changed my sheets, took as much antihistamines as I could (bad seasonal allergies). My mom flew in from out of town to help me with my recovery. I went out and bought a whole bunch of things to help, listed above. Some of the items I decided to get based on other people’s posts here (whoever suggested ginger ale, bless youuu). Picked up my Hydrocodone prescription (after a snafu with insurance; apparently private insurance won’t pay for it if you don’t go to the right pharmacy? So I learned that. I decided to pay the $33 out of pocket for the medication rather than try and go through the stress of figuring it out. Problem for post-surgery me).

**Surgery Day**

I have a remote job, so I worked in the morning and took the rest of the afternoon off. I picked my mom up from her AirBnB and we drove together to the surgery suite, arriving around 12:30. I filled out some more paperwork and then sat in the waiting room.

I desperately had to pee (since I had read on other posts that they would take a urine sample, and knowing me if I had peed that morning I wouldn’t have been able to pee for the nurses and I didn’t want this to be postponed) so I practically ran to the back room when my name was called. My mom stayed in the waiting room.

They took my urine sample then led me back to a small curtained area where I signed even more paperwork and confirmed my allergies and medical history. I changed into a gown and put my hair up in a bun way on top of my head so that it wouldn’t dig into the back of my skull while on the table and so it could fit into the hair net.

A nurse came in and stabbed the back of my hand trying to get the IV in, she had to get another nurse to put it into my forearm; not drinking for almost 12 hours at that point had made my veins really faint. I was honestly surprised I wasn’t having an anxiety attack in the hospital room.

The anesthesiologist came in and introduced herself. She explained that she was going to put me to sleep and then intubate me. I kind of didn’t want to know what all she was going to do (ignorance is bliss and all) but I still asked a couple of questions (waking up in the middle of surgery is a myth, apparently haha).

Then the OB came in and confirmed one last time with me that I wanted to do this. I did, and she explained to me one more time the risks involved, then they started to wheel me into the back. They stopped at the bathroom and asked me to pee one more time rather than put in a catheter. I was actually really happy about that, I had not been looking forward to post-catheter pee-pain.

I peed, got back in the bed, had a mask put over my face, and the next thing I knew I’m waking up and my mom is talking to a nurse.

My memories of this bit are a little hazy. Apparently I spoke exclusively in Japanese for a while, which made it hard for the nurse to gauge how I was doing haha. Eventually I came to enough to go back to English. They gave me some ice to chew on and a Popsicle. I vaguely remember being in a wheelchair and then a car and then a bed.

At this point it’s about 5:15pm. Mom tells me that the OB went back and explained post-op care to her since I probably wouldn't remember anything she told me, haha. They didn't find any endo or signs of tumors or anything in there either, which was good news. Mom makes some miso soup, we watch TV for a while, and eventually I start to fall asleep again. Sleeping upright helps when you have a travel pillow, more or less keeps your neck straight and aligned with your back.

**Day 01 - Saturday**

I woke up sore and stiff around 7 in the morning. My mom, jet lagged and up since 5, was there to give me my hydrocodone. I felt like I couldn’t take a really deep breath, probably because my lungs couldn’t fully expand due to all the gas.

We had breakfast of bananas, coffee, and oatmeal. I needed support getting out of bed and crossing to the kitchen table, but the hydrocodone works fast and it’s more uncomfortable than painful. It definitely feels like a deep period cramp than a healing surgical wound. I have to hold my stomach when I laugh, cough, or sneeze, which hurt a little.

My mom and I basically sit at the table and binge watch The Way Home on Hallmark+ while we do a puzzle all day. We have sandwiches for lunch, and once or twice an hour I get up and do a slow lap around the room. I nurse the ginger ale and have a GasX after eating, and my god it has never felt so good to fart.

We go to dinner with my roommates; we go to a Japanese restaurant so I get some sushi and udon. The broth is heavenly, and feels nice and light in my stomach but still filling.

My shoulder and arm really starts to hurt on the way back to the AirBnb so I take another hydrocodone, wait for that to kick in, and then hop in the shower. I was told that I was allowed to shower, just not sit in a bath. I was still nervous about getting the incisions wet so I covered the sealing tape with waterproof bandaids and kept the water lukewarm. It did wonders for the muscle aches.

No blood spotting, and no painful urination. Small victories. 😊 (Also, the nurses took pictures of my uterus before and after, that was really gross to look at but also kind of interesting. The uterus is a lot smaller than you think).

**Day 02 - Sunday**

Woke up miserable. Today was definitely the worst day of recovery. I was so sore and all my muscles had locked up in the night so I could barely move. I wanted so badly to twist and crack my back but no can do with a hole in your naval so I just had to take some Motrin and muscle through. Mom is saying I shouldn’t rely so much on the hydrocodone since it’s addictive, and my pain is nowhere near high enough to warrant it, so I’m not going to use it much today I don’t think.

Yogurt for breakfast this time. Today, my naval is much more sensitive to movement; even sitting up straighter or leaning too far down to pick up a fallen puzzle piece from the table causes immediate discomfort. The gas pain isn’t so bad today though, still largely in my upper right arm and under my ribs on the right side. It feels like… a stitch in your side when you run too hard without breathing properly, and like you lifted weights without warming up.

I do a few more laps while we continue binging The Way Home and puzzling. Around one pm, my period started, which probably explained some of my soreness that morning. A two-punch whammy of surgery pain and legitimate period cramps, hooray! Luckily the Motrin makes it easy. I put on a shoulder heating sticky pad thing on and one of the pads that the nurses sent me home with.

Mom makes chicken and dumplings for dinner, we watch more TV.

I have a remote job, and I feel like I’m lucid enough to log in tomorrow. So now I’m in bed at home (my house is only a few blocks away from the AirBnb, but I have roommates and not enough space for my mom to stay either so she heads back). I’m still sleeping sitting up, I’m a little nervous to move back onto my side again.

**Day 03 – Monday**

I woke up with more gas pain in my shoulder and torso, but it’s manageable with more Motrin and a heating pad. I drink a protein shake for breakfast, go to the bathroom, take care of other menstrual duties, poop (finally!) and log in from my bed at 8 am.

Work was so slow that I end up napping for a while. I take the opportunity of my mom’s Airbnb being so close that I walk the 5 minutes up there to join her for lunch. We watch more TV and have leftover chicken and dumplings, then I head back. She takes my car to go pick up some things, I work, and it’s pretty ok.

I call the doctor’s office to schedule my Post-Op, since I was too out of it on Friday afternoon to do it. It’s on the 7^(th).

I take more Motrin when the gas in the arm starts to act up again. It really only does when I’ve been standing or moving for too long I think, and so when I finally sit back down the gas settles, which sucks. I can’t wait for this gas to be goooone.

Took another shower, and changed the strips across the incisions with more waterproof bandaids. It feels weird that my body is literally being held together with bandaids right now, but the incisions are a lot smaller than I thought they would be so it’s working.

**Day 05** \- **Tuesday**

Nothing much to report today. Woke up to more gas pain in my right arm again, took a Motrin and logged into work.

Ran an errand in the afternoon, lunch and dinner with Mom again. More Motrin as needed.

**Day 05**

Making an entry today since this is the first day since surgery I woke up without any gas pain in my shoulder. Yay!

I tried sleeping on my side last night, ended up kind of in a ¾ lay nestled in pillows and heating pads. Woke up completely on my side with no pain so I think I’m ok to actually sleep on my side tonight. Will still be gentle about turning over though.

Had to drive my mom back to the airport this morning. I confided in her about doing this back when I initially finished my consultations, and she was very firm in her support of my decision. I love my mom so much.

I’m nervous about self-care now, but my roommates are my best friends also so I feel like I can ask them if I really need something. I’m going to change my Bandaids tonight (probably every couple of days just so they’re always clean and fresh.

 

That’s my experience thus far! I’ll update this after I finish my Post-Op on Friday. Stay safe everyone. <3",8,1738797515.0,sterilization,0,1.0,False

Today i felt like sharing this with ya’ll.

After i completed my 12th like everyone i joined IELTS. I joined the morning slots as the first IELTS class running was 6 o clock in the morning. It was peak cold November pitch dark till 6 in the morning. I was sharing class with a bunch of people in their 30’s working individuals because they work 9-5 and this time was perfect for them. 

Among them one girl around my age let’s call her RITI for this time. RITI (20) was PCL nurse graduate a year older than me. She used to attend class so well dressed with heels hairs perfectly braided with sharp eye liner and mask 
I was always surprised how someone this early has time to prep themselves for this early class.

Fast forward. We were put together in a messenger group chat to discuss speaking session together. So i got her facebook from there. I was surprised how a girl with this neek for fashion had a lowkey life in facebook and instagram. 

Yes. Using speaking test as an excuse we started chatting. Maile first chat mai asked for a coffee as there was a coffee shop just beside the consultancy. SHE AGREED and the coffee hangout went perfectly. ( i am going to skip minor chats now )

We started talking more and i found out she recently broke up with a nepali bloke in Canada. She basically said they had sex when he came Nepal and since that he ghosted and she was left devastated. 

The breakup was few weeks ago which is still fresh as a coriander. Well we hung out went end of lake, our favorite spot was that white bench in sarangkot. We used to have small lunch together and she always made sure they call me before she sleeps ( for speaking session only )

Fast forward it was that time in pokhara where it rains for days in winter. We went to sarangkot to casually hangout and after midday it showed symptom of cold rain we hurried back home but too late it started raining we were cold and taking a shelter. She was getting cold she hugged me so tight for almost 20 mins. I hugged her as well my lips were in contact of her ears she was telling me how sound of me breathing near her ears is making her uncomfortable ( in sexual way ). I insisted on letting go but she was like "" nai na ekchin "" after that the rain calmed down a bit we were already soaked so we decided to move on and went to a cafe for hot drinks as this cafe had a cabin we were there sitting with awkward silence and cold they brought in a heater for us. At this point we were used to talking explicitly so she joked around saying i got hard out of shame i was telling her how she can never make me hard. She dared me she can get me hard in 20 sec. I couldn’t believe what she was saying completely flabbergasted atp. The argument started heating up and i kept saying she cant make me hard. She said well give me 30 sec she legit put her hands on my pants started giving me handjob. I was playing a loosing battle i was already hard. She kept going on atp i couldn’t control. I said oi hami cafe cabin ma xam dont forget. She said just few more mins kept going while making eye to eye contact smiling at me. ( To this point a solider fell off ) couldn’t kept my mind straight she said "" Can i "" maile ni ok vandiye. GLOCK GLOCK moment was one of the best BJ’s i recived. 

After that we went home and started talking over chat how we couldn’t fuck. She legit said bholi vetum nata. Maile kata vanera sodheko she said ma hotel book garxunta. Those days felt like i was living a dream. To get all my fantasies real and SAX SUX without commitment.

But everything changed when i

My wife and I are visiting for 9 days from the states in the spring.  We’re service industry people so coffee shops, wine bars, bakeries and restaurants are how we typically tour a place, and are excited to explore the scene in Dublin and have a number of places we’re excited to visit.  What I hear most from here is that people usually plan to do too much while they’re there. So in an effort to minimize travel fatigue I’ve restructured my schedule. In doing so am I missing out on something, or would pivoting some place be more impactful?  I know I don’t NEED to see everything, because I’m sure I’ll be back. 

Day 1:
Fly in to Dublin, nap off our jet lag and explore Dublin

Day 2:
Dublin

Day 3:
Rent a car and drive to the cliffs of moher (sight renting some bikes around here to see more scenery and take it all in). Drive to Galway. 

Day 4:
Explore Galway and the surrounding areas scenery. 

Day 5:
Easy morning in Galway, drive back to Dublin in the evening, where we’ll station out of for the rest of the trip. 

Day 6:
Drive out to Wicklow National Park (possibly some horse trekking) and relax in Delgany

Day 7-8:
Explore Dublin

Day 9:
Grab a quick brekkie and head to the airport

Tonights? Excited to visit and don’t want to miss out, but I also know we’ll need to give plenty of time for pubs, pints, and liesurly strolls around town.  ",1,1738797268.0,irishtourism,5,1.0,False

One for me and one for my mom! 
Just thought I’d give a little review and also ask for suggestions! I’m currently looking for more western inspired smells ( think coffee and whiskey, a little gunsmoke dry grass, maybe even hay notes, leather sage that sort of thing! I have my eyes on a few from cherrykas trunk but I’m always open to suggestions:)

Fumer : 
In the bottle : I got a very cedar note, mom said it was real woody 
Wet : still cedary, but not bad! I like a good cedar note. Smells like you’re burning cedar wood at a bonfire. It’s a nice smell and not too strong 
Dry down : still kind of cedary but definitely more woodsmoke. I kept sniffing my wrist after I put it on because I liked it so much. Woody but not in your face and definitely would layer well! And didn’t turn barbecue esc like some smokey notes I’ve tried 

Moonstone : bought this for my mom! She’s a fan :)! She likes musks and light florals and amber smells so I figured she’d like that one 
In the bottle : she said it smelt like a perfume she had in highschool, kind of musky and soft (?) definitely got amber notes from it. 
Wet : on me it smelt more like baby oil but my mom seems to have better skin chemistry than I do because it smelt good on her lol 
Dry down : for me the longer I had it on the fainter it got, still had a tinge of baby oil but not very strong and definitely more wearable,  I could pick out the jasmine in it now, smelt great on my moms shirt.

Service : very fast shipping, got it like the next week? Came with a sticker and some maple hard candy? Not complaining they were good! 

Overall : I really like fumer. Smells like I sat outside and threw some cedar wood on the bonfire! A little sad my skin doesn’t seem to like moonstone but my mom really likes it!

The story of Clementine



Clementine Kruczynski slammed the door behind her, her breath coming in uneven bursts as she leaned against it. The apartment was silent now, save for the muffled sound of Joel’s footsteps retreating down the hall. Their fight—one of many, but somehow different this time—hung in the air like the last few notes of a song that would never be played again.

She squeezed her eyes shut. *Maybe we’re not good for each other,* he had said. *Maybe we never were.*

Maybe. But wasn’t love supposed to be messy? Weren’t people supposed to fight, to hurt each other in ways that only meant something because they also loved each other? But this wasn’t just one fight. It was the accumulation of so many moments, so many missed connections, so many wounds neither of them had taken the time to heal. And she was tired.

The next morning, she found herself in front of the Lacuna office, staring at the glass door, hesitating. The decision had seemed so simple last night, fueled by anger and heartbreak, but now, standing here in the cold morning air, she felt something gnawing at her. She knew what this meant. She knew she’d wake up tomorrow without Joel, without the weight of him, without the laughter, the pain, the love.

And yet, she pushed forward. Because maybe she didn’t want to carry this anymore.

The moment she stepped inside, she was greeted with the sterile scent of antiseptic and faintly burnt coffee. The waiting room was dimly lit, sparsely decorated with modern furniture that felt impersonal. A young receptionist with thick-rimmed glasses and a bored expression glanced up from her computer.

""Miss Kruczynski?"" she asked, chewing on a piece of gum. Clementine hesitated before nodding. ""Go ahead and fill this out."" The receptionist slid a clipboard toward her, tapping her nails against the desk impatiently.

Clementine sat down, her eyes scanning the form. **Procedure to erase targeted memories.** Seeing it in writing made it feel real in a way it hadn’t before. She hovered her pen over the paper, swallowing hard before forcing herself to sign.

Before she could second-guess herself, the door to the office opened, and a tall, kind-faced man stepped out. ""Clementine?"" Dr. Mierzwiak asked. His voice was calm, reassuring. ""Come on in.""

She stood, suddenly feeling as if the weight of her own decision had latched onto her spine. The office was warm, too warm. Books lined the walls, some on psychology, others on neurology. A framed diploma hung behind his desk, but Clementine’s eyes kept drifting to the faint hum of a machine in the corner.

""You understand what this procedure entails?"" he asked, settling into his chair.

She folded her arms. ""I get it. You zap the bad stuff, and I forget I ever met him.""

Dr. Mierzwiak offered a small smile. ""It’s not quite as simple as that. We remove specific memories, but emotions tend to leave echoes. You may feel the absence of something you won’t remember losing.""

Clementine chewed the inside of her cheek. ""Yeah, well, I don’t want to feel anything when it comes to him.""

Dr. Mierzwiak nodded. ""Alright. If you’re ready, we’ll need you to gather any objects, pictures, anything tied to the memories you’d like erased. It helps us map out the procedure.""

Clementine exhaled slowly. ""Fine. Whatever gets this over with.""

She expected a sense of relief, but instead, she felt something colder—like stepping into deep water, knowing she wouldn’t come back up the same.



**Chapter 1: Memory One**

Clementine sat on Joel’s couch, arms crossed, her body rigid. Her legs were tucked beneath her, but she didn’t curl into the cushions the way she usually did. She stared blankly ahead as Joel’s voice drifted through the air, reading from some book she didn’t care about.

Her mind buzzed with irritation, still clinging to the remnants of their last fight. His voice, usually something she found comforting, grated against her nerves.

Joel paused, lowering the book slightly. ""Are you even listening?""

She didn’t look at him. Instead, she exhaled through her nose, tipping her head back against the couch. ""Nope.""

Silence hung between them for a beat, thick and tangible. Joel sighed, shutting the book with a quiet thud. ""Clem, come on—""

""Come on what?"" she snapped, her gaze sharp as she finally met his eyes. ""You’re reading to me like that’s gonna fix anything. Like it’s gonna make everything okay.""

His jaw tightened, but he didn’t snap back. He just looked at her, patient, searching. ""I just thought... maybe we could just have a quiet night together. No fighting.""

She scoffed. ""Right. Because ignoring everything always works.""

Joel rubbed his temples. ""That’s not what I—""

""Whatever,"" she cut him off, standing abruptly. ""I’m gonna go.""

Joel straightened. ""Clementine—""

She was already at the door, grabbing her coat. She hesitated for just a second, something tightening in her chest. But then she shook her head. *No. I’m not doing this tonight.*

Without another word, she left, slamming the door behind her.

And now, as the memory began to dissolve, she watched herself walk away, felt the cold rush of air as she exited his apartment. It should have made her feel free, weightless. Instead, all she felt was nothing.



**Chapter 2: Memory Two**

The highway stretched out before them, an endless ribbon of asphalt cutting through open fields and trees blurred by speed. Clementine rested her feet on the dashboard, scowling slightly as she picked at the edge of her nail. The radio crackled, a familiar tune spilling through the speakers. She didn’t care enough to sing along this time, not after last night.

“You’re not even trying,” Joel said, a teasing lilt to his voice.

She turned her head, meeting his eyes with a raised brow. ""Maybe I don’t feel like trying.""

Joel let out a small chuckle. ""Come on, Clem. What’s a road trip without you butchering every song on the radio?""

She huffed, crossing her arms. ""You think I’m *that* bad?""

""No,"" he admitted, a small grin tugging at the corners of his mouth. ""I think you’re *worse*.""

She glared at him but couldn’t quite hold onto the anger. It had been her armor for the last few days, but right now, it was slipping, leaving something raw underneath. She reached for a french fry from the greasy fast-food bag between them and tossed it at him.

Joel caught it midair, grinning as he popped it into his mouth. ""You’re gonna have to do better than that.""

She shook her head, finally cracking a small smile. ""You’re impossible.""

They drove in silence for a few minutes, the tension between them shifting into something else. Clementine hated how easily he could do this—break through her frustration, make her forget why she was angry, even if only for a little while. He reached for her hand, and without thinking, she let him take it, their fingers lacing together like it was second nature.

Her heart clenched.

She hated that she still wanted this. That she still wanted *him.*

She turned her gaze out the window, the landscape rushing past in a blur of green and gold. The weight of their last fight sat heavy in her chest, but here, in this car, with his hand wrapped around hers, she could almost pretend it didn’t exist.

But as the memory faded, as the warmth of his hand began to dissolve into nothingness, she felt the loss settle deep into her bones.

And for the first time, she wished she had held onto it a little longer.



**Chapter 3: Memory Three**

She was drunk. Properly wasted, her limbs heavy, her thoughts tangled, slurred together. The dim lighting of Joel’s apartment made everything feel unreal, like a dream she couldn’t quite hold onto. She sat on his couch, knees pulled to her chest, a bottle dangling loosely from her fingers.

Joel sat beside her, watching her with careful eyes. He always watched her like that—like she was something delicate, something he was afraid might break.

“Clem,” he said softly, his voice thick with concern. “What’s going on?”

She scoffed, shaking her head. “What’s *going on*? What’s *going on* is that I’m a fucking mess, Joel. That’s what’s going on.”

He didn’t react. Didn’t flinch, didn’t protest. He just stayed there, patient, waiting.

She let out a bitter laugh, wiping at her eyes before the tears could even fall. “I don’t know why you put up with me.”

Joel frowned. “What do you mean?”

She turned to look at him, really look at him. His face was lined with exhaustion, his mouth pressed into that small, worried frown she had seen too many times before. He loved her. That was the worst part. He really, truly loved her.

And she had thrown that away.

“You deserve someone who’s… *normal*,” she whispered. “Someone who doesn’t fucking fall apart every five minutes.”

Joel’s expression softened, and without hesitation, he reached for her, pulling her into his arms. She didn’t fight it. She let herself collapse into him, let herself be held.

“You’re not too much, Clem,” he murmured against her hair. “You’re just right.”

For the first time, she wanted to believe him. She wanted to believe that she could be enough for him, that she wouldn’t ruin this. But now, as the memory cracked and unraveled, she realized the truth—she had already ruined it. And now, she was erasing it.

She clung to the feeling of his arms around her, desperate to hold onto something, anything, but it was slipping away, dissolving into static.

“No,” she whispered. “Not this one. Not yet.”

But it was already too late. The warmth of Joel’s embrace disappeared. The apartment, the couch, the dim glow of the lamp—it all faded, leaving nothing but emptiness in its place.

And in that emptiness, regret took root.





**Chapter 4: Memory Four**

The room was dark, the only light spilling in from the streetlamp outside. The soft glow painted Joel’s face in warm amber, his features relaxed, his breath slow against her skin. They were tangled in the sheets, his arms wrapped around her like she belonged there. And she had—until now.

Clementine could feel it unraveling. The walls around them shimmered, the fabric of the bed thinning beneath her fingertips. She gritted her teeth and tightened her grip around Joel’s wrist, pressing herself into him as though she could anchor herself there. She wasn’t ready for this one. Not yet.

*No. I want to stay here.*

She turned her face into his chest, inhaling deeply, trying to drink in every last bit of him before it was gone. The scent of him—soap and something inherently Joel—was fading. She could feel him slipping away, piece by piece, the weight of his body against hers becoming lighter, as if he were being plucked from reality.

“Joel,” she murmured, her voice thick. “We have to go. We have to get out of here.”

Joel shifted slightly, brushing her hair from her face, his expression soft and sleepy. “Go where?”

She gripped his hand tighter. “Anywhere. Just—just come with me.”

She pulled him, urging him to move, but his body was slowing, his fingers untangling from hers against her will. The room around them darkened, shadows swallowing the furniture, the walls, the sheets. *No. No, no, no.*

“Clem?” Joel’s voice was faint now, distant, confused. “What’s happening?”

She let out a desperate breath, trying to shove back against the force pulling them apart. It felt like trying to run through water, her limbs heavy, useless. Her heart pounded against her ribs as she fought against the inevitable. *I made a mistake. I don’t want this. I don’t want this anymore.*

She grabbed at his face, trying to hold onto him, trying to memorize him, but even his features were starting to blur, slipping from her mind like sand through her fingers.

“No,” she whispered, her voice cracking. “I changed my mind. I want to remember you. I want to remember us.”

Joel smiled, but it was sad, understanding. His hand came up to cup her cheek one last time. “You won’t.”

And then he was gone.

The bed beneath her vanished, the room collapsed into darkness, and Clementine was left alone in the void, gasping for breath. Cold, empty.

And full of regret.



**Chapter 5: The Final Memory**

The beach house smelled of salt and old wood, its bones groaning under the weight of the wind howling outside. The night pressed in around them, thick and heavy with the crisp bite of the sea. Moonlight spilled through shattered windows, casting long, pale streaks across the floor like ghosts of all the moments that had come before.

Joel was beside her, breathless from laughter, his fingers tangled with hers. They had run through the snow like children, reckless and wild, the cold burning their lungs, but they hadn't cared. For a moment, they had been infinite—untouched by the weight of the world, untethered from the inevitability of time.

She turned to him, her eyes bright with mischief. “We’re gonna get arrested for this.”

Joel smirked, the kind of smirk that always made her forget how to breathe. “Then I guess we better hide.”

They collapsed onto the wooden floor, limbs tangled, laughter still caught between them like fireflies in a jar. She could feel his warmth beside her, the steady rise and fall of his breath, his hand resting against the small of her back. He was looking at her the way he always did—like she was something he had been waiting for his whole life.

And then—

Something shifted.

The walls trembled.

And suddenly, she could feel it—like fingers pulling at the edges of a fragile page. The air wavered, shimmered, blurred, the way dreams do before they slip away.

Her heart slammed against her ribs. No. Not yet.

She gripped Joel’s hand, her fingers digging into his skin. “We have to go. We have to get out of here.”

Joel frowned, his brows knitting together. “Clem? What are you talking about?”

The house shuddered again. The walls flickered. The floor beneath them softened, as though she was sinking into something vast and empty. The memory was unraveling. It was coming undone.

She pulled at him, her voice breaking. “Come with me. Please. Just—run.”

Something in her face must have scared him, because he sat up, his grip tightening around her arm. “Clem—what’s happening?”

She tried to move, tried to pull him with her, but it was like wading through quicksand. The warmth of his body was already fading, his voice stretching into something distant. No. No, no, no.

She turned to him, her hands trembling as they cupped his face. She memorized him in desperate, frantic swipes of her gaze—every freckle, every line, every stupid, perfect thing about him.

Tears burned her throat. “Joel…” her voice broke. “I’m so sorry. I can’t stop it.”

Joel blinked, something unspoken passing between them, something deeper than words.  The look of confusion faded from his face as he stared into her eyes.  His thumb brushed over her cheek, slow, gentle. His voice was quiet, steady, full of something that made her chest ache.

“It’s okay, Clem… You did your best.”

No. Not like this.

“Tell me what to do, please,” she pleaded, her breath hitching. “I don’t want a life that doesn’t have you in it.”

Darkness crashed down around them.

And just as everything was swallowed whole, as his face melted away into nothing, his voice found her—soft, familiar, breaking through the void like a whisper against her skin.

“…Find me in Montauk.”





**Final Scene**

Clementine walked out of the Lacuna office with a dull ache in her chest, her mind blank but unsettled. There was something missing, something she couldn’t name, but the weight of its absence felt suffocating. She knew she had erased someone—*something*—but the details eluded her. She wandered the streets, hands buried in her coat pockets, trying to convince herself that she had made the right choice.

Days passed. Then weeks.

Patrick, the boy she had started dating, the one from the clinic, was sweet at first, but there was something off about him. Too eager, too familiar, like he was trying to fill a void she didn’t remember having. He said things that made no sense—things about places they had never been, inside jokes she didn’t recognize. She caught him staring at her sometimes, his eyes searching, almost expectant.

She began to pull away, restless and agitated. Something wasn’t right. *Why did I do this?* The question gnawed at her late at night when she lay awake, staring at the ceiling. And then there was *Montauk.*

The word stuck in her mind like a song on repeat. It meant nothing. But also... it meant *everything.* It rang in her ears in the quiet moments, echoed in her dreams. It was a whisper in the back of her thoughts that refused to fade. One evening, without really knowing why, she packed a small bag, got in her car, and drove toward the coast.

The train station was nearly empty when she arrived. Snowflakes drifted lazily from the sky, dusting the platform in quiet white. She didn’t remember the last time she had been here, but something about it felt... *right.* As if she were meant to be here.

And then—

She saw a man.  

Tall and slender.  Covered head to toe in winter clothes.  His demeanor was not unlike that of a child who lost his mom in the grocery store.

He stood near the railing, hands tucked into his coat pockets, staring out at the ocean. There was something about him that made her heart stutter. A pull, an invisible thread tightening between them. He glanced up, and for the briefest moment, their eyes met.

A flicker of recognition.

It was fleeting, like a déjà vu slipping through her fingers. But then he smiled—just a small, uncertain curve of his lips. And something in Clementine, something deep and hidden, responded.

She smiled back.

The train whistle blew, the sound slicing through the cold air. She turned away, just for a moment, just to glance at the snow beneath her feet. But in that moment, she felt it—the ghost of something lost, something erased. A life, a love, a story that had been rewritten.

She swallowed and took a shaky breath before calling out, ""Hi.""

Joel blinked, caught off guard. He looked around as if confirming she was talking to him before hesitantly replying, ""I'm sorry?""

""I just said hi,"" she almost shouted, the nervous energy in her voice making it louder than she intended. Her stomach twisted into knots.

Joel’s lips quirked into a confused smile. ""Uh... hi. Hello. Hi.""

Clementine laughed, a strange mix of relief and something else she couldn’t name. The train rattled around them, the wind carrying away the sound of the world, leaving only the two of them in a moment that felt like fate folding in on itself.

Somewhere, deep in the recesses of their minds—where no doctor, no machine could reach—the memory of each other still lingered.

Please let me know of any additions you think we should make and if there are any errors.

All but two of the packages have been delivered. Here are my recipe recommendations, but obviously use your own judgment and style. If you wanna cup, that's cool too. I just assumed we would do these pourover style.

**My brewing style**

I used a V60 for all of these. I figured that's what we all probably have. I do a standard 3-pour pattern: bloom which is 2x water to coffee (60g water, 20g coffee), and then a second pour that is 2x the bloom (60g bloom, so 120g second pour), and then a final pour to final mass (300-340g here). I don't pour based on time, but instead I pour when I can see the coffee bed through the water. I pour probably 3-4g/s for most of the pour. I also make a divot in all of my V60 pours, and I pour in a spiral within a spiral, so I make tiny spirals as I go around in a spiral (gotta make a video of this one day).

Gonna be tough to communicate grind, but I used an acaia orbit and I'll indicate the deviation from touch point below. I'm not sure how this translates to your grinder, any guidance here would be helpful if folks know of a translation. I've found +8 deviation to be about a 4.33 on my ode gen 2.

**Recipes**

***Coffee 1***

This was the hardest coffee to dial in for me. I think it needs a little overextracting to elevate what's going on. I don't recommend anything over 1:16 for this coffee because it was pretty harsh, astringent, and sour. But dialed in, it was so good.

200F

20g : 300g (1:15)

\+7 deviation from touchpoint (finer side of medium-fine)

final brew time was 4:15

***Coffee 2***

Standard recipe, no modifications here.

202F

20g : 320g

\+8 deviation (slightly more coarse)

final brew time was 3:53

***Coffee 3***

Standard recipe with modification to temperature.

200F

20g : 320g

\+8 deviation (slightly more coarse)

final brew time was early 4 minutes, didn't record precisely.

***Coffee 4***

Standard recipe with modification to temperature and ratio to temper some of the processing.

198F

20g : 340g

\+8 deviation (slightly more coarse)

final brew time was 4:21

***Coffee 5***

This one is up to you. Maybe give the beans a smell first. If you're looking for higher intensity, go 1:16 and higher T, but 1:17 and 198F might be the call if you want more of the coffee and less of everything else. You'll know what I mean when you try it. Wild ride.

198F (maybe 200F if you want more of the processing)

20g : 340g (maybe 320g if you want more of the processing)

\+8 deviation (slightly more coarse); could see this going slightly finer if you want more processing

final brew time was 3:59

### Functional Layout

The layout of your kitchen significantly impacts its functionality. Your new home needs a layout that supports your cooking and entertaining style:

- **Work Triangle:** Implement the work triangle method, where the stove, sink, and fridge form a triangle for efficient movement.
- **Island Space:** If possible, include an island for additional workspace and casual dining options.
- **Flow:** Ensure there is enough space for multiple people to move around without bumping into each other.

Creative Storage Solutions for Every Kitchen in a New Home
----------------------------------------------------------

When moving into a new home, one of the most exciting tasks is designing your kitchen. It’s not just about aesthetics; practical storage solutions are essential for creating a functional culinary space. Every kitchen should be equipped with clever storage that maximizes accessibility while minimizing clutter. Here are some creative ideas to make the most of your kitchen storage.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/new-home-needs-kitchen  
  
### Open Shelving

Open shelving can give your kitchen a modern touch while providing easy access to your kitchen essentials. This approach allows you to display beautiful dishware, jars of spices, or cookbooks, turning bland walls into vibrant showcases.

- **Choose the Right Location:** Place shelves near the prep area for convenience.
- **Mix and Match:** Use various shelf sizes for a personalized look.
- **Go Creative:** Consider floating shelves or corner units to maximize unused spaces.

### Pull-Out Drawers and Shelves

Pull-out drawers in your cabinets can revolutionize how you access items stored at the back. No more digging through clutter—simply pull out a drawer to find what you need. This is particularly useful for pots, pans, and larger appliances.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/new-home-needs-kitchen  
  
#### Benefits of Pull-Out Drawers:

- Increased visibility of contents
- Create more usable space within cabinets
- Keep items organized and easily reachable

### Utilize Vertical Space

Many kitchens lack in utilizing vertical space, which is crucial for storing items effectively. Think about extending cabinets all the way up to the ceiling. You can also install wall-mounted racks for hanging pots and pans, freeing up valuable cabinet space.

#### Vertical Storage Options:

- Tall cabinets for large appliances
- Magnetic strips for knives and metal utensils
- Hooks and racks for vertical hanging of utensils

### Multi-Functional Furniture

In smaller kitchens, every piece of furniture should serve more than one purpose. Consider a kitchen island that doubles as a dining table or a cart that can be wheeled in for extra prep space when needed. These additions not only enhance mobility but also keep the space flexible for various tasks.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/new-home-needs-kitchen  
  
#### Smart Options for Multi-Functional Furniture:

- Drop-leaf tables that expand for guests
- Ottomans with hidden storage for kitchen linens
- Sink covers that create additional counter space

### Use Clear Containers for Organized Storage

Clear containers are your best friend when it comes to pantry organization. They allow you to see what you have at a glance, making cooking more efficient. Different shapes and sizes can help in categorizing food items such as grains, snacks, and baking supplies.

- **Label Everything:** Clear labeling keeps everything where it should be.
- **Stackable Options:** Maximize vertical space with stackable containers.
- **Grouping:** Store similar items together for easy access.

### Revamp Cabinet Doors

Don’t overlook the insides of cabinet doors; they can be prime real estate for storage! Adding hooks or small shelves creates additional space for spices, cleaning supplies, or cutting boards, thereby saving drawer space.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/new-home-needs-kitchen  
  
#### Creative Ideas for Cabinet Doors:

- Install hooks for measuring cups
- Add a spice rack for quick access while cooking
- Use small bins to organize utensils

### Bar Carts

A bar cart isn't just for drinks; it can serve as a stylish mobile storage solution for any kitchen. Use it to hold cookbooks, extra dishware, or even as a coffee station. Plus, it can be moved around the kitchen as needed.

#### Benefits of a Bar Cart:

- Extra storage space
- Easy organization for serving items
- Can act as a decor piece for aesthetic appeal

Designing the kitchen of your new home with these creative storage solutions can vastly improve both functionality and style. Invest a little time upfront, and you'll enjoy a well-organized kitchen that makes cooking and entertaining more enjoyable. Happy organizing!

Whether it's modern appliances, ample counter space, or energy-efficient fixtures, these elements play a significant role in enhancing your culinary experiences.

I currently have an NZETA issued. Do i still need a visitor visa and entry permission?

Also, i read that the immigration officer will ask biosecurity questions. What do i need to expect? 

I read that i need a return flight booked, but I am in a situation where I am traveling ""Standby"" since I am a Flight Attendant. Do I need a confirmed seat on a flight? or I can just book a standby ticket back to the USA?

Aside from all these document questions, i just wanted to know recommendations for Auckland 

How reliable is public transportation?(trains/bus)

Is it recommended to stay at hostels?

Some recommendations on places to visit, trails to hike, restaurants, coffee shops, etc.. 

Any tips or advice for a 1st timer visiting New Zealand?

I know its a lengthy post, but would appreciate any answers. Thanks a lot 😁

I am so exhausted, i really just want to take a break, I work at a coffee shop but i find myself judging myself too much, always saying ""you have a degree, yet you work in a coffee shop"". I am so hard on myself all the time, I always focus on the things I don't have, rather than the things I do. I have really tried to give myself a break and find wins in non career related things, but it doesn't feel of value to me. I feel society and university have jammed it into me that career is everything, now that I am left with a bit of a wait for my career to start, I fear I have nothing else. I am learning piano and working hard in the gym, making time for my friends, spending more time with my boyfriend and traveling more. However, none of these feel like wins, they feel like fillers because I don't have a real job.

I got a job as a cleaner at a factory and having made the decision to work completely by myself i was probably the most excited to go to work out of anyone in that building. I worked alone and was allowed to decide in what order i did my tasks. I liked thinking about how i could do my tasks faster, more efficiently and in a way that was just good enough.

I am very fit so once i had the muscle memory down i could dust off the whole factory in under an hour and work up a good sweat with it. I figured that if i just used a broom instead of pulling out the whole cleaning wagon as i was told, it'd not only be faster, but I could also reach the corners now. I figured out optimal routes for some tasks and skipped tasks that felt unnecessary and that saved a lot of time. After about a month I managed to get done in less than 3 hours.

The rest of the time I'd sit on the toilet. I brought a book, some japanese homework, a squeeze weight to excersise and downloaded some anime before work each morning. There was also a very nice kroatian guy who let me use his office with coffee machine as an extra break room because ""You're a hardworking guy and deserve and extra break"". It was a big building and everyone mostly just stayed with their own machine, so everyone just assumed I was in a different section.

I actually did tell my boss about it(not the toilet part). There was being talked about me taking extra breaks, so I got ahead of them and went to my boss. I said ""hey, I've been getting done with my tasks quicker recently. And doing an extra round here and there or taking an extra break isn't very useful to you of course. So how about I work a few hours less and get paid a little more but less than i get now. You get the same amount of work for less money and I get more free time."" He refused and just wanted to give me more work, so I made up other tasks that I could do myself and just didn't do them. No one noticed a thing after that and I worked there for 6 months until I managed to find a house, for which I had to move.

Not sure if I should feel guilty, they were the ones who severely overestimated the difficulty of the job and I still don't see the problem with the deal I tried to make with my boss.",47,1738796127.0,confession,4,0.98,False

1iinet6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1iinet6/managing_pcos_holistically/,Managing PCOS Holistically,"I've been a long time member of the PCOS community. There seems to be a huge uptick in folks getting diagnosed (which is great) and realizing that their symptoms are valid,  whether it be weight gain, infertility, acne, hair loss, unwanted hair growth, etc...  A lot of people are wanting to manage this shitty thing, but many are understandably discouraged, don't know where to start, or are being led down a path of bandaid solutions by their egregiously uneducated GYN's, PCPs or Endos.

I am someone who watched a family member develop PCOS, not manage it, and subsequently develop Cushing's Disease. As I started to develop symptoms, I knew I didn't want to go down that path and I was fortunate for two reasons: I developed PCOS in a time where it was being talked about more, albeit minimally, and two; another family member of mine began attending medical school to be a Naturopathic Doctor as my health began to deteriorate so she is/was an incredible guiding light.

I want to put as much info as I've acquired through my Naturopathic Doctor sister, my personal research and my actual Naturopathic Doctor that I pay to see, in one place. Obviously, take what you want and leave the rest but my hope is this: to put all of this info in one spot for people to reference, and that everyone reading takes away that yes it sucks, but this is a condition that can be managed in MOST cases, and birth control/metformin/GLP1s  aren't going to HEAL anything. Can they be tools and resources? YES, but doctors aren't presenting them as such, they most often tote them as a quick fix that gets you out of their office until its time to make babies. I see so many posts of people in such despair and hopelessess; if that's you, please know you don't have to feel that way forever. I know not everyone has access to health insurance, and naturopaths or bandwidth to do a bunch of research, so hopefully this is helpful for even one person.

So with that said:

Here were my symptoms beginning in \~2020 ( I was 20) :  
Hair thinning, facial hair growth, weight gain, missed periods (averaged every 60/70 days between), extremely heavy and painful when they did happen, spotting for up to 100 days at a time, dermatographia, hidradenitis suppurativa, insomnia, extreme sugar cravings, vitamin and nutritional malabsorption as shown through bloodwork, leaky gut, acid reflux, high A1C, high SED rate, acne, never satiated/no fullness cues, joint inflammation and pain, high blood pressure, cysts on my left ovary, constant dehydration, very easily getting sick

My lifestyle at the time:  
Sedentary: pandemic, and first time working an office job, not regularly going for walks or working out  
Diet: 50% high carb meals cooked at home- think pasta+ protein, or rice/potato + meat + veggie style meals and then 50% take out/drinks/sweets: frequently drinking sugary coffees, eating ice cream or cookies for dessert, getting takeout for lunch at work, drinking 3-4 coffees/day (so, the standard american diet LOL)  
Sleep: Getting into bed around 11, not being able to fall asleep until 1- up at 8am  
Stress: high- academically, having moved out for the first time, first ""real"" job, recovering from a challenging childhood... you get it

Growing up:  
Food: I grew up in poverty, my mom cooked every meal for us out of whole foods - go her!- but carbs are cheaper than protein so my diet consisted of meat/veggie/carb meals with significantly more access to the carb side of the plate to fill up  
Stress: High! Top tier student, impoverished family, athlete, stressful family dynamic  
Activity level: highly active; multiple sports, running, lifting etc

The downward spiral into PCOS and more:  
Eating disorder in highschool: Orthorexia/Over Exercising followed by depression and binge eating disorder. Weight went from>!126lbs to 285!<over the course of 6 years. Rapidly started gaining weight in \~2016  
Highly stressed beginning in 2016 for many reasons  
Majorly lost my ability to exercise through chronic injury beginning in 2016  
Insulin resistance begins  


I give all of this backstory to show just how important it is to see how things develop. When you see it all written out, it's obvious that something would begin to go wrong in the body. Modern medicine is beginning to acknowledge that PCOS is an expression of a multiple system failure and when we address it as such, we can begin to put people on a path to actual healing.

So here's what I did, simplified, redacting the trial and error for the sake of whoever is reading this novel. For clarity's sake, I didn't make all of these changes at once, I tried and failed many times, and I edited along the way:   
Water with electrolytes everyday, mutliple times a day  
High quality multivitamin (Pure)- Inflammatone (Designs for Health)  
Eat low carb/keto- I do not count calories: I bettered my diet over about 2.5 years before getting to this point, this was a very hard process that included reducing processed foods, reducing carbs, reducing caffeine intake, not taking sugar in my coffee, eating more protein, etc, all over a very long time period. Quitting weed helped a lot because no more munchies. INSULIN RESISTANCE AND GLUCOSE SPIKES ARE YOUR WORST ENEMY- please research this further for yourself, I'm not a Dr. (Glucose Goddess on IG is amazing, her podcast on DOAC is a great intro to her)  
Occasionally fast (12-16 hours)  
Minimized exposure to endocrine disruptors; I use natural soaps, detergents, no candles, rarely use perfume and makeup outside of mascara/natural makeup brands   
Movement: frequent walks, lifting, swimming, etc, zero exercise as punishment  
Learned about MCAS and Histamine issues: I think this is one my greatest issues that caused the expression of PCOS- I no longer eat avocados and frequently avoid many other high histamine foods like red sauce because I know my body struggles with this.  
Prioritize sleep and rest THIS IS SO IMPORTANT; I'm an 8.5 hour gal, 9 if I'm in my luteal phase. try to get my eyes on the early morning light and sunset light everyday (circadian rhythm regulation)   
Acknowledge and honor my menstrual cycle- give myself more rest in my luteal phase, lean into more movement in my follicular phase, continue to move gently after day 2 of my period   
Therapy, specifically somatic therapy. It's hard to come across, if you don't have access a helpful tool is The Tapping Solution  


How I feel today:  
No dermatographia, no hidradenitis suppurativa (occassional flares with stress), my hair has grown back, I still have facial hair that I wax, although it's lessening (I think I will try to expedite this with spearmint tea/supplement). I get my period every \~30 days, it's five days long, minimal cramping, 2 days heavy, three medium to light. Ovulating monthly, losing weight, reduced joint pain, fantastic digestion, no acid reflux better skin/less acne, no leaky gut, lowered A1c, Blood Pressure and normal range SED rate, rare sugar cravings, incredibly reduced food noise which I really never thought would be possible. Better outlook on life, more positive, happier, not constantly stressed and feeling like my body is failing me.  


Ultimately, I am grateful that PCOS told me to listen to my body; that's all it is, your body trying to get your attention. When I first went to the ND (which was hella expensive so let me pass this advice on for free), he ran one million and a half labs and I had high markers that showed I was trending towards Lupus. That shit is scary, that marks the start of the territory of needing medication for your entire life. Did PCOS cause that? Nope. PCOS is often the amalgamation of different things going wrong that we've given a pretty acronym so we can put people on birth control and call it a day. Untreated PCOS can develop into a whole array of things that guarantee you as a lifelong pharma customer ... I won't go into a rant about western medicine because this is truly already so long and you do not care, and because I 100% believe it's useful in a lot of cases, but I'll end it here: you can heal, you know your body, and it's not your fault, but you are the only person coming to save you so it is your responsibility if you want to feel better to take matters into your own hands.
