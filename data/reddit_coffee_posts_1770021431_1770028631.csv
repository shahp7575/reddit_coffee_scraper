Episode 7 The Legend of Ruby Sunday- The hype episode to end all hype episodes, this one was all set up. Which means it is only as good as its sequel, the finale. Oh my, how badly that aged. The premise of the episode will remain mostly the same with the duel mystery threads of who is Ruby’s mother as well as who is Susan Twist being the focus. 

Generally we’re going to keep this episode except we’re actually happy to see 15 reunite with Rose Noble instead of wondering, “who’s that?” proudly introducing her to Ruby saying she’s my oldest friend, at least with these eyes. Rose now working for UNIT where this episode shall mostly take place. Confused Rose explains to Ruby what regeneration is. Dr. has returned asking Kate for help in learning who this mysterious woman/ Susan is. Kate reveals Susan Triad while also informing the Dr. his secret request was recently finished. Episode plays out same with the secret request being the time memory room allowing them to investigate mystery of Ruby though this leads to nothing like in the show and we get a mini Dr/Rose adventure as 15 is led to Susan Triad and the reveal of the One who waits no more being the God of Death Sutekh.  Susan Triad being an nanogram for Sutekh and not the misdirect of her being the Doctor’s granddaughter from the classic series also named Susan. A fine enough episode crippled by its sequel, this episode is mostly set up. I did cut the character of Mel completely \[a former companion of the 7^(th) Dr.\], not so much because I disliked her, but upon seeing her role in season 1 and 2/ series 14 and 15 she doesn’t really do much and ends up getting in the way of the season long plots. Best to cut the character for now, bring her back at a time with the care she deserves, and in the meantime save that budget! We’re also going to tweak Sutekh’s dog design, sh\*t looked goofy in the episode. Some of the concept art while keeping the core jackal like design makes him appear a bit more creepy. I strongly believe Russell or someone asked the designers to tone him down slightly to make him less horrifying and more bombastic for the screen to appeal to children, but children like being scared and that design in any form isn’t the most terrifying thing. It’s okay, they can handle it. Our Sutekh is going to be less CGI dog gleefully gloating and more a thinning, skeletal creature leering over the Tardis taking possession of our favorite ship. He should appear almost uncanny, just barely dipping into that area of unnatural. He might not be straight horror but he is creepy.

Episode 8 Empire of Death- This episode needed a rewrite. Too big of a scale, it was too obvious the Dr. would win, no real tension, poor pay offs that completely killed any potential hype the series may have retained and crippled the next season before the marketing had even began. My work is cut out for me.

Episode begins with Sutekh and his Harbingers \[the fake Susan Twists\] threatening the Dr., Ruby and Rose. Dr. does his normal hero speech. Sutekh replies, “You killed the Toymaker and thought that made you my equal? I am Sutekth the destroyer. Fear me Dr. for that is all you have left. You are dust to me. This thing you call universe is nothing. Nothing at all. But what remains. That will be good.” Dr. swears he will stop him and Sutekh agrees he would so he promptly kills the 15^(th) Doctor with his dust. This is not a cop out or a fake regeneration. He is dead. Ruby and Rose flee the building with Sutekh killing everyone inside yelling after Ruby to, “RUN! RUN!” Now we cut to the part of the neighbor Ms. Flood speaking to Cherry about storming the gates of Heaven, we’re changing this speech. While cool it doesn’t make sense going forward in regards to her true identity. Her new speech will be, “Do you believe in the power of prayer?” Cherry replies, “I certainly do.” “Then start praying.” “What are you talking about? Who are you?” Cherry asks. “I’m sorry you tiny little woman, I’m so, so sorry it ends like this. I had such plans. Oh well, let’s hope he saves both of us this time.” And the two turn to dust killed by Sutekh. Ruby and Rose flee to UNIT where they inform Kate of what has happened. Ruby begins to break down traumatized by her close friend’s sudden death. Rose takes her to the side calmly talking her through it, she makes no false platitudes, she simply lets Ruby talk it out counseling her to breathe. It is clear since we first met her Rose has grown vast in such a short amount of tie. She resembles her namesakes more and more everyday. After Ruby is good Rose prepares to call her mother warning of the potential danger when Sutekh and his Harbingers arrive appearing on the Tardis. Sutekh speaks to Kate, “You thought you could kill Death? Do you miss your father Kate Lethbridge Stewart? Let me tell you a secret. He is with me now. Do you want him back? I can make you see him again. All you must do is ask.”

Kate fights back but all of UNIT are easily slaughtered, even Rose just as Donna picks up on the other end. Ruby, in a state of terror had already started running before the dust hit the ground. She couldn’t even bare to face him, the God of Death. Flinging back to the closest, safest space she can think of Ruby locks herself in the time memory room, and recreates the memory she had been shown earlier, of the last time she had seen her mother, the night on ruby road. For a moment she calms down until Sutekh begins to tear his way inside, the strange room giving him trouble. In frustration his death spreads even killing his own Harbingers as all are destined for the gift of Sutekh. He didn’t need them anyway, their power was vast. But it was given to them by him, he who has waited for so long. Cowering afraid Ruby wishes the Dr. was there with her and her memories oblige, the room creating a Doctor from her memories to stand by her side. Instantly he falls into Dr. mode knowing exactly what to do and say to make her feel alright. Once again the Dr. stands up to Sutekh furious after hearing what had happened to Rose. “Sutekh! I will burn the stars from their orbit! I’ll drag you across the solar system and leave you in the depths of the Time War! Bring her back! Bring her back now!” “Yes, Dr! You feel it too? Don’t you… you too have seen the beauty of oblivion. We know the truth don’t we Dr? Where she’s gone? Your little friend? There’s nothing there. There never was. Only the end. Only the beautiful silence.” Angrily the Dr. attempts to argue with the beast but Sutekh reveals he was foolish to ever have had any fear over this man, this Dr.! He tells them of how he had waited, escaping during the events of Space Babies- the cracks of the Flux weakened his prison as well as freeing the Toymaker, the Toymaker’s own schemes further weakening his chains, and finally it was the Dr. and Ruby themselves who freed him. The Tardis breaking down the barriers as they crashed through the Time Vortex, invoking Salt was only the final match that burned his shackles away. He had been watching them ever since, patiently learning, so he would not make the same mistake he had prior upon their first meeting/ the 4^(th) Dr., and he alone saw the truth that had stained their relationship, the Dr. and Ruby’s. The friendship that was built on a lie. Sutekh tells Ruby about the song, and the snow that falls around her which she never seems to notice, and why the Dr. cared so much about helping her learn who her mother actually was, ”Didn’t you tell the girl? Why you were so determined to not let her see the night her mother fled? The night she ABANDONED her?” “Dr. what is he talking about?” “Don’t listen to him- he is full of tricks and lies he will say anything to deceive you”, but Sutekh replies, “no Dr., that is not me. I am oblivion and there is purity in that, I would not lie. I haven’t the need.” “You lied about being my granddaughter!” “The truth can be easily… bent to suite one’s needs. Tell her Dr. stop fleeing from the truth for once in your life stop running! Tell the girl. Tell the child why her mother left.” The Dr. looks at Ruby. “I thought she may have been special. That she was someone other than what she appeared. I’m sorry Ruby.” “Dr?” Ruby looks at her best friend and almost doesn’t recognize the face. “There was no special person, child.” Sutekh coos, “you were abandoned. Discarded and forgotten. You’re not special Ruby Sunday. Just a child. Another scared child. Doesn’t it hurt? Come to me child. I can remove your pain. Feel Sutekh’s embrace and for a moment… forget.”

*Processing img qm5gv18572hg1...*

Ruby’s faith breaks and the Memory Dr. vanishes, and Ruby runs fleeing the room. Ruby returns home only to find Carla, Cherry and Ms. Flood already dead/dust. She collapses in front of fridge where the pictures slowly turn to dust. Sutekh arrives laughing and it’s revealed she never left the time room he’s been watching her the entire way. Ruby is left broken. “Kneel” he says, “You are nothing child. Unwanted by even your own kin. You have my sympathies. I will grant you mercy of only the purest kind. Come, kneel before Sutekh.”

Ruby looks up, on her knees with stained eyes, “I’m nothing? Unwanted, I don’t matter… who are you to talk to me like that?” “I have had many names but here, now I am God.” “Whatever you are- you are not the God of me!”

Ruby remembers her family realizing she has a found family and they are the same thing as ones given by birth, her family appear around her in the time room followed by the Dr. and her friends and then Unit and Rose, Sutekh reminds her they’re still dead. Ruby agrees claiming they’re memories but memories can live on. Ruby creates a mental Tardis around her barring Sutekh for the time being complete with her Dr., she tells him she has a plan and to take them back to the night her mother abandoned her. Dr. initially refuses but she begs him to trust her and he eventually gives in with no other options. Arriving Dr. asks now what and Ruby replies rather fittingly, we wait. Though they don’t do much of that for long, as her mother slowly approaches leaving the baby by the church and Sutekh himself appears tearing through reality, 15 warns Ruby about what she’s planning to do saying he’s just a memory he can’t help her here. She jokes you flew the ship didn’t you? He replies did I? With her hands on the console. Ruby explains that she’s the reason Sutekh was even freed in the first place, her coffee took them to the ship where he latched onto them and Ruby runs forward to the baby version of herself, in terror Sutekh realizes what she’s doing and charges after leaving the Tardis as Ruby reaches the younger version of herself causing a time paradox. For a moment reality ends as Ruby defeats Sutekh by trapping them both in a paradox, Ruby by holding her younger self thus causing herself to implode/not exist meaning the pair never went to the space babies ship and Sutekh was never released still trapped in the Vortex. From this event reality begins to crack and it begins to snow around the memory Dr. With all of Ruby’s actions beginning to become reverse and he too starting to fade the memory Dr. uses his final moments to pilot the Tardis to find the real Dr., 15 having revived from his untimely death but before he can get out a full explanation he fades into dust, only telling the Dr. to check the fridge, the Tardis will do the rest. Confused 15 enters his ship asking the Tardis to do what she has already done and take him where he has to go. Tardis materializes in Carla’s home and 15 sees the fridge. He sees the missing pictures   


*Processing img 3za6d4y672hg1...*

And for some strange reason he begins to cry. Not just cry. He breaks down. Completely broken and horrified though he doesn’t know why. Balking in terror at the unseen tragedy. Until it clicks. He remembers because memories live on, and like Ruby Sunday before him he remembers his found family. He remembers Kate and Donna, Rose and Carla and Cherry because it’s Cherry and most importantly he remembers the very scared young woman who he swore he would never again abandon. He’d broken this promise once. Never again. No more. The Dr. pilots the Tardis apologizing to the ship that he was about to do something very stupid, and claiming Ruby had the right idea- wrong time. The Tardis flew threw a storm of snow, the maelstrom whipping about around him he see her in the distance and we see the opening scene of the season, a tear rolling down his eye as he runs into the cold shouting her name, “Ruby!” She looks back, refusing his call. Believing him to just be a memory and determined like never born she looks back to her infant self. But this is the Doctor. And he would bend Hell back to stop a child’s tears, what do you think he would do for her? A friend in need. “Ruby!” He begs. “Let me save you.” Ruby stops, looks back, Sutekh roars lunging for her, Ruby takes the Doctor’s hand and the pair flee into the Tardis. “Where are we going?” Ruby gasps. “Wait!” The Dr. orders, “he’s not here yet. The one who waits no longer! Come on then, you dog of death! You ridiculous thing! Come on!” Then he whispers, “come and get us. Ruby get ready to hit that lever but not a moment before I say, not until Sutekh climbs back on my Tardis!” Death shrieks and Sutekh claws at the ship as 15 slams shut the doors, shouting NOW! Ruby pulls the lever and the Tardis flies out for its final trip. The universe begins to tear around them as Sutekh roars extending his gift of death around anything he touches. The walls of the Tardis begin to tear, catching fire! Stars begin to go out one by one and reality once again begins to break. “You cannot overcome me!” Sutekh snarls, “there is only freedom through me! I am the God of all Gods!” “YOU are so right babes!” 15 shouts using the intercom in the Tardis, “Or nearly. Like most people who aren’t me you’re slightly off I’m afraid. Because you are right, we cannot defeat you- your majesty of disappointment. But you are not a God! You are a snake. An average, slimy pretender who kills not because he is some embodiment of death but because you are afraid- Sutekh! You are terribly afraid of meeting someone more powerful than you are, someone who could overthrow you. So you gained power but no…, that wasn’t enough! You had to have more. You see I’ve met people like you before, and I do mean people you SACK of decaying bones I have met people like you before. Who prey on others to push themselves over. You hurt and you kill because you are too afraid to try something else, to reach out– and make a connection. To believe in something. To trust in someone else”, 15 looks over at Ruby, suddenly the time vortex opens up. They had arrived at their destination and our trio at last saw clearly where they were going: directly in front of them was the wreckage of the space babies ship, and the Dr’s Tardis was hurdling directly for them with their own recently freed Sutekh just latching on.

“but I believe in you, Sutekh. Oh, you majestic one! I believe in you- killer of Gods. So go on then! It doesn’t matter what you are! One touch is all it will take! Do what you do best. May the best man win!” Sutekh shrieks in terror, “I am a God! I will not fall. I cannot die! I will not die! I can’t…”  The past and present Sutekh collide in terror. 15 says, “Trapped in a literal Hell. He’ll be killing himself for the rest of eternity. Goodbye Sutekh”, 15 steers the Tardis away leaving only dust in his wake. 

*Processing img oc79kyt872hg1...*

“Now what?” Ruby asks, “everyone’s still dead.” “Not everyone”, 15 smiles at her. “Everyone that counts”, Ruby chokes on her words, “Cherry. My mum. God, I never even told her. I’ve been so stupid, all this time looking for my birth parents, and I had the two best ones right in front of me and I didn’t even care! Like it wasn’t enough.” “Honey”, 15 puts his hands gently on her shoulders and he smiles at her till she smiles back, and he says to her the simple truth between every child and every parent, “she knows. But if you want so badly to tell her yourself, we’re here.” Ruby looks confused, the Tardis shifts signaling they’ve landed. “I don’t understand.” “Oh, Ruby come on now! You’re good but try and keep up. Your plan! Loved it! I stole it! Had the two Sutekh’s touch each other, a literal Grandfather paradox ensues, reality bursts, reversing all the evil’s done. At least from that point forward… before then, there was nothing I could do. But after… that is within my power Ruby Sunday.” Ruby gasps, “You’re saying everyone…” she can’t even finish the sentence. “Your mother’s waiting for you. Go on.” Ruby bolts out the Tardis- flinging the doors wide open and she rushes up those familiar steps, the same way she used to when she was a kid while old grouchy Flood next door would start screaming at her to slow down, she’s only got the one life- use it! And she runs and runs and does not stop until she ironically almost runs Carla down, in the background Cherry and Ms. Flood are engaged in vicious bickering but Carla doesn’t hear that. She doesn’t hear the sirens outside or the radio playing too loudly in the neighbor’s room. Immediately seeing the look on Ruby’s face Carla grows concerned, scared for her safety. A mother’s intuition. But there was nothing else the matter, nothing left to fear- at least at this moment. There was only their family, their love, their life and all was good. 15 smiles to himself. Happy at last. Happy he had done something right. He looks over the Tardis console, a mismatch of old things littered about. And a single photo that had been knocked over behind the interior. Flipping it over he looked at the image. The face of his granddaughter Susan. “So what do you think Sue– I did something right? Maybe I’ve still got something left after all?” The Tardis doors swing open and Ruby comes sauntering in. 15 is confused, happy yet perplexed. What was she doing here? Didn’t she find her mother? “That was a month ago”, Ruby explains, “you crazy old man.” 15 is perplexed but Ruby just laughs, kissing him on the cheek and gently whispers, “that’s right. Rose told me about your regenerations. You’re ancient!” Clearly offended 15 defends himself saying, “I am not that ancient.” “You’re like an interactive tomb, you even got dust coming out your walls!” Ruby blows a bit of Sutekh dust away from a slim crack in the Tardis wall. “Hey, be careful I am not done patching that. So, what are you doing here?” Ruby smiles, “it’s been a month. If I don’t go out the house she’s going to kill me. Like literally kill me. Climbing on the Tardis and spitting death dust and everything.” 15 laughs. “Fantastic! Where are we off to next? There’s this great Interstellar Song Contest in space but I warn you it is incredibly violent-- I may have been banned there 6 times for inciting public unrest, good thing I have a new face. You’ve got all time and space- so start using it. Where do you want to go next?”

Ruby awkwardly shifts from one foot to the other. 15 nods, smiling but clearly disappointed, “that’s what I thought. I’m happy for you,  Ruby Sunday. Where you off to next then?” “I’m going to stick around home for a bit. It’s weird. That’s always been my home but I guess I thought about it almost temporary like it was just a pit stop before I’d find my real family. But I already had. You helped me see that. Thank you Doctor. You’re always welcome in our home.” “Well thank you, but I have a universe left to see, and a family of my own that are still out there. Some things I need to resolve, still don’t know where I come from. Or if I even had a family. If that was all a lie too…” “Dr?” Ruby looks concerned, “all the people you told me about? The ones you travelled with. Me. Rose. The girl she’s named after… you think we’d just forget about you? You might not always be able to see us but you go on, we remember. In a way you have the biggest family of us all… and I’d be happy to be apart of it.” “I’m happy you are”, the Dr. gives Ruby one final hug. “I’m going to miss you Ruby Sunday.” “You really like saying my name don’t you?” “I do. It sounds like a fairytale.” “I’m not a fairytale, Dr.” “No. But it’s good to believe in one.” With a final wave Ruby sees the Dr. off as he flies away to his next adventure with Ms. Flood waving him goodbye and wishing him well on his travels in time and space.

Empire of Death final thoughts and season wrap up: So, the concept of Sutekh returning is great. Wonderful villain, the fandom’s excitement was palpable. The reception and I would argue execution of this episode cratered next season’s chances at being a hit, the best they could have hoped for at that point was for s2 to be an underrated gem that would no one watched live, ie; the 7^(th) Doctor era after his first series. Biggest changes were removing the universe ending plot, those stakes are way too high to be satisfyingly resolved in the allotted time plus all the other seasonal tie ups. I chose to keep the damage Sutekh did more ambiguous as well as when we show it, really focus in on the emotional aspect. The characters we hopefully care about, Ruby’s abandonment trauma, and that brings us to killing 15 right at the beginning. This was a risk but if successful we now have one less main character to juggle and can focus in more on Ruby’s journey, kind of similar to what Russell attempted back in the day with Martha/s3. The key here is execution. This is our last impression till the Christmas special, it’s got to be a big one, and a satisfying one. I don’t mind teasing future stories but never at the expense of the current one, so here we dial in on two things; resolving Ruby’s arc and Sutekh the big dead dog. The God of death got to do his thing. Let’s spend time with him, keeping him somewhat docile on the Tardis is a good way to alleviate some of the work on the animators and in theory can let the brilliant voice actor strut his stuff. Not to be too dower but he’s an older fellow, we don’t know if he’ll get to come back again. This could be HIS finale. Let’s make it a fitting send off, an episode title is a promise. Empire of Death has to deliver. Dialing in on Ruby’s abandonment as well as removing her birth mom gives more time to the actual episode for plot stuff as well as giving more time to the characters we actually know and care about, Carla, Cherry, etc. Not to mention s2 does literally nothing with her b. mom so cutting her just saves the budget! Overall the season had a ton of different ideas and was overall very experimental but on an 8 episode slot sometimes the interesting one offs need to be canceled or, in the way I attempted here, bring them more in line on a thematic level with the overall arc/ point of the season. I initially liked 73 years, it was only in this rewrite did I realize what was missing from it, it’s filler. Never a good thing when the big hurdle your facing is an 8 episode limit. Ironically we don’t have the time. I also wanted to ramp up the danger from each episode’s monster/villain. Yes these are aliens but functionally from a writing perspective these are monsters, kids are coming to see the monsters, adults have nostalgia for their favorite monsters. The threat/danger was not really there in most of these episodes but the concepts were interesting, Maestro being my personal favorite example. In the show started off so d\*mn good, but by the end kind of filtered out. 

*Processing img ufdkg6xc72hg1...*

So we cut the music sequences and dial in on the character, let Maestro be intimidating. If you’re going to hype them up they got to do something worth remembering, that’s for any story. The two things I was considered with the most were of course, 15 and Ruby. General fan reception \[not necessarily my own\] was that Ruby was nice but bland and 15 was either smiling or crying there was no in-between. There was a general consensus of I like these actors but I don’t know these characters. So my job is to tie in each episodes plots to their respective arcs, with 15 we have slightly more wiggle room as we have extra time with him \[future/prior seasons and episodes\] as well as more investment \[the show is LITERALLY his name\], still not an excuse to give him nothing. He is the MC thus the main draw/hook going forward into a potential s2/Christmas special and even a s3\[RUSSELL!!!\] So with 15… 1^(st): no single tear EVERY episode, let the man express himself in more than two ways. He can get angry, Dot and Bubbles ending? Perfect, more of that, ideally this would be the 15 character centric plots we would be getting all season. 15’s deal is he’s the recovery/therapy Dr. As someone with a history of depression and anxiety HEALTHY PEOPLE DON’T BEHAVE THIS WAY, smiling all the time an acting happy only to break down crying ALL the time means you are in denial. That’s ok, that’s an arc in itself. He’s in denial. But that needs to be the arc, maybe that was the original plan but it’s definitely not happening now so we have to make do. While we do have hindsight you gotta know if s3 is auto renewed from the get go you have to account for that. Plan accordingly or have a back up. Seemingly they did neither. Our 15 has been slightly renewed emotionally \[every regen seems to act like a soft reset for these arcs anyways\] but he is struggling. His anger is there and can be boiling but he is trying to move on. Part of that is letting go, from the rage, the fear and ego of everything being a world ending threat \[Ruby\] and allowing himself sometimes to be wrong. Admittedly I feel I could have done more with 15 this season but given the limitations I set of trying to keep things similar enough/ lined up with where things are going I did feel shockingly, limited. But that’s okay, because I had Ruby. A character absent for most of s2 meaning I could give her an arc with some proper weight. I was a little nervous about the whole adopted kid lives her life with adopted mother/family only to find birth parent= MY REAL MOM!!! :0

Disclaimer; I’m not adopted. Just adorable. But I have friends who were adopted, can’t imagine if they still watched Dr. Who they’d feel too comfortable with this ending. Plus Carla’s a more developed character so let’s tie her into the plot more heavily making the story about self acceptance \[tying in Ruby and 15’s arc\] and found family \[literally the point of the Doctor character, he’s always travelling with friends\]. Overall I hoped you guys enjoyed reading the season, season 2 is already done and I will be posting soon, I am EXTREMEMLY proud of it :) Feel free to tell me what you think in the comments, ask any questions, only rule is please keep it civil, this is a great show deserving of a greater community. We have enough to stress about already. Thank you again, I love each of you, have a fantastic(!) day! See you next time- Chris

1. Biology is becoming operational infrastructure.
2. We are moving from reacting to visible failure (sick animals, spoiled fruit) to continuously measuring internal biological state at industrial cadence. When biology becomes an auditable data stream, quality control shifts from a cost centre toward a risk- and contract-management layer.
3. Food continues to be clinicalized.
4. In functional nutrition, defensibility is migrating from molecular novelty to cohort-specific protocols and response maps. As more players can produce similar ingredients, the hard problem becomes generating repeatable outcomes in defined populations, with endpoints brands can defend in compliant claims.
5. Molecular refining is replacing ingredient hunting.
6. Instead of searching for the next exotic plant, companies are using AI and high-throughput screening to turn high-volume commodity side streams into tightly specified, high-margin molecules.

These are high-level observations. I share more news-specific thoughts in the newsletter.

This week, I cover:

Products and partnerships:

☕ Gates Foundation-backed pilot equips East African coffee farmers with Helios AI to manage climate risk

👀 MrBeast ate cultivated chicken from UPSIDE Foods on camera

🧠 Cropin launched an AI-driven agrifood platform aimed at reducing risk across the global food value chain

🍬 2nd Nature, Inc. applies AI to discover clean-label sweeteners hidden in agricultural side streams

🥛 [one.bio](http://one.bio) allows formulators to add “invisible” fibre to foods and beverages without affecting taste or texture

🤰🏽 How Helaina is redesigning women’s nutrition from one size fits all to life stage-specific biology

🐄 Aleph Farms partnered with CDMO Cell AgriTech and set up an entity in Singapore to serve as its APAC hub

Funding and M&As:

🐔 Orbem raised €55.5M Series B to expand its AI-based MRI inspection systems across poultry and produce markets

🧬 Barnwell Bio raised $6M to turn barn microbiomes into early outbreak signals

🎨 Octarine Bio raised €5M to bring its precision-fermented pigments to market for food, textiles, and personal care

🌾 Heritable Agriculture secured $4.98M grant from the Gates Foundation for AI-driven climate-resilient crops for smallholder farmers

🍄 Maia Farms secured C$3.75M to expand specialty mushroom and mycelium ingredients focused on functional and nutritional health

For here or to go?,"Thanks to Julie, I've seen the error of my ways and learned how to begin an actual post from scratch on Reddit. It's a brand new day!

Just wanted to put some thoughts and topics out there. 

Post-pandemic, I feel that we have devolved into a ""to go"" world. I once thought a cortado ""to go"" was a bizarre made up drink. It's now the norm - at least at my shops. 

I'm wondering what these words mean to you? I think culturally, specialty coffee has veered towards having drinks ""for here"" and I require my staff to ask that question for capps, cortados, macchiatos, espressos, and pour over coffee. Many of them glaze over this requirement, perhaps not understanding ""the why"". The devastation of watching a new customer, excited about our brand, receiving a lil paper cup of espresso. 

Is it important to you? What do you ask of yourselves and your staff? And what do your customers seem to want?

I have seen a couple shops throughout the country provide to go containers that are glass, like jars. I find that tactic fascinating and I'm so curious how it helps or hurts the business.

Anyways, thanks for entertaining these thoughts. Looking forward to what y'all think and how the answers might be different based on cafe size, geographical location, business values, etc.

PPI seemed to help a bit but I still had this full up feeling lower down and it feels like I’m not emptying bowls fully, it’s incomplete or I go again later. Coming from D where I could get it all out it’s a really strange feeling. 

Had a lot of pain and gas before a bowel movement earlier and it helped going to the loo. 

Wonder whether I’ve been stressed lately and tense up my body rather than relaxing but most things I read usually say it’s D if you’re anxious.

C. Special: The Church on Ruby Road Special- we open same as in the show, the Dr seeing the night where new companion Ruby Sunday’s mum abandoned her at the church on Ruby Road, a tear running down his cheek. Meeting Ruby at the bar we also see 15 is looking for someone tracking a signal, Ruby goes to an interview to find her birth parents where a string of accidentals occur around her, also there the Meep \[Beep the Meep a small rabbit like alien\] crawls into Ruby’s backpack. The string of accidents around Ruby are caused by the Meep in hiding. We meet Carla, Ruby’s foster mother like in show, Ruby left to watch baby Lulu, another foster child. Ruby meets the Meep and is confused, the Meep asks her to take him to his home- a little pod-ship nearby so he can go home begging her to take him. 

In the home the Wraiths arrive/rabbit looking soldiers mistakenly taking baby Lulu away in their spaceship and Ruby jumps onto a ladder leading upwards to it with a protesting Meep on her back/backpack, 15 runs along the rooftops tracking the ship and he jumps onto the ladder as well with the two climbing abord the ship, immediately being taken prisoner. In a cell 15 learns about Ruby’s past as an orphan and her abandonment at Ruby Road, hence her name. Once he’s gotten bored of their surroundings he decides to break them out with the sonic screwdriver, revealed to be the device he was using before to track the ship. Meep claims he doesn’t know what the scary wraith aliens want with him. The trio sneak around the ship and get Lulu back/ 15 trying to broker peace only for the Meep to be revealed as a time travelling war criminal who wants to usurp control of the universe from his “Boss”. Meep mocks Ruby claiming he only revealed himself to her because he knew with her pitiful sob orphan story she’d take him cause “they were the same bleh”. Meeps also mentions he’s been picking Wraiths off one by one explaining why there’s so few left on the ship \[that’s how you budget!\]. Noticing something on his ankle the Dr. scans the Meep with his screwdriver revealing the Meep to be in possession of the time bracelet he had been tracking, it’s low on power good for one jump left. As he’s a time criminal and the Dr. is a Timelord he feels particularly responsible. Meep’s plan was to reignite his ship’s engine blasting London to pieces in the process but seeing as thanks to the Dr. he now has control of the peace-loving wraith ship he decides to just takes theirs and make his escape. Ruby and the Dr. stop him disabling this ship’s engines causing a crash. A bit disheveled 15 emerges from the wreckage joking he might have gotten a little carried away but since they landed in water and no one was hurt it’s all fine. 15, Ruby and Lulu return to Ruby’s home where 15 meets Carla and Ruby’s grandmother, Cherry. Ruby’s earlier show interview calls revealing they no nothing about Ruby’s birth parents distressing her. As they talk and watch over Lulu, Ruby vanishes causing the Dr. to break down seeing a fridge containing all the pictures of kids Carla had helped and memories created due to the relationship with her daughter Ruby vanishing leaving Carla now a broken mess, bitter at the world. Not only that, no one besides 15 seems to remember who Ruby even was. A crack appears in the room \[the cracks in time from series 5\] and 15 realizes he couldn’t find anyone in the crash, not even the Meep! Using the signal of the time bracelet he had scanned earlier 15 follows the signal to Ruby’s past the night where she was abandoned running past Ruby’s mom and finds the Meep preparing to kill the little girl. 15 talks to the Meep trying to talk him down while the Meep gleefully monologues giving the Wraiths that the Dr. had alerted enough time to locate his presence. Meep is arrested angrily telling the Dr. the Boss won’t like this. 15 waves him off and makes sure baby Ruby is taken in and with his curiosity getting the better of him he looks around for her mother, seeing the hooded figure and scene from the show choosing not to go after her. Episode wraps with the pictures and memories on the fridge now restored, The Dr. then travels back saving the reporter who had interviewed Ruby from one of the Meep’s sadistic antics. Ruby realizes the Dr. is a time traveler and goes out looking for him and is directed by her neighbor Ms. Flood to the Tardis. There 15 recruits Ruby with Ms. Flood seeing them off same as in the actual episode.

So the big differences we made were cutting out the actual episode’s villains, the Goblins, replacing them with the original Star Beast’s villains, Beep the Meep. While the Goblins weren’t bad I felt Meep would make for a more contrasting villain to help flesh out Ruby’s character. I did enjoy the original episode but it didn’t seem to quite land correctly as it wasn’t the exciting return the show needed it to be. Not to say it was bad or it turned many people off but I suspect the overall “fine” attitude casual fans had over the 60^(th) and this Christmas special combined with the rather lackluster first few episodes really dulled the season’s potential momentum, which is crucial for not just any show but any story. One change that I will make going forward is that of the villains, the actual show seems to be aiming down in regards to its audience, continuously downplaying itself. While this should always be a show a child could watch and enjoy most of the modern Who audience does range a bit older, to late teens and adults, generally with people who grew up with New Who and even retaining fans from the Classic Era. It’s okay to get a little dark, a bit more serious. The most successful seasons in both New and Classic tend to adhere to this rule, even with kids. They like the dark stuff. So we’re gonna have the villains be a bit more nasty. The Toymaker was quite cruel in his torture and apathy for Rose, and the Meep despite his adorable size and appearance looking more like Yoda he is actually a violent and sadistic psychopath. Dr. Who lives by its monsters, let them be monsters.

Space Babies Episode 1- Tardis lands next to Isaac Newton’s apple tree causing word gravity to become Mavity like in show. Laughing in Tardis 15 briefly sticks his body out door returning with Ruby’s coffee, 2 joke about until Ruby accidentally knocks coffee over on Tardis console accidentally sending them to a ship at edge of universe. Immediately the Tardis groans in pain with newly burnt torn walls before vanishes fleeing in terror. Initially no signs of Life save for a robot slowly moving in the corridor, the ship making strange unintelligible announcements and the corridors constantly reconfiguring themselves. An elevator beeps bringing them upstairs all while something watches them from the shadows. Up the elevator our duo meets the last surviving crew members of ship all entirely run by babies and their AI caregiver NANE. Babies tell their fear of the creatures down under and Dr. traces AI finding a real person, Jocelyn who tells him something had boarded the ship, one by one the crew went down to investigate never to return. Being frightened she hid herself away carrying for the babies only from a distance so creatures won’t take her as well. Dr. is initially angry at her leaving the children defenseless but she claims the creatures won’t hurt them as they’ve never come upstairs for them, it was the adults they wanted. Dr. vows to uncover the mystery and get children to a refugee planet and her to a cell, despite her pleas that she’s just an engineer. During this Dr. has vision of night Ruby was born and her mum, snow begins to fall around the ship disturbing him. Dr. and Ruby go down to investigate and eventually meet the Not- Things, creatures with garbled speech patterns taking on their appearance as the two are separated. Here we get the initial which one is real sequence from Wild Blue Yonder. Barely escaping Dr. and Ruby retreat back to the elevator only to learn one of the babies, Eric, inspired by his new love, Ruby, finds the courage to descend to the lower level where no baby has gone before and challenge the terrifying creatures. He is quickly subdued. Dr. and Ruby return to save baby Eric, avoiding one of the Not Things lurking down the corridors appearing not to notice them eventually finding the other guarding Eric. 15 engages stealth mode to avoid to the creature while Ruby slips in behind them to take the baby. The creature reminds them the walls are shiny and reflective, idiots. His speech pattern is now stronger with less errors. The duo are immediately spotted and the Dr. throws out his back up plan: a line of salt invoking the fear of superstition. This works and the duo flee with Ruby carrying a cackling baby Eric retreating into the captain’s corridors where 15 learns the truth; the Not Things were accidentally picked up believed to be survivors of at the time a crashed ship. The crew met them on the lower levels as a precaution to protect the babies, one by the creatures took the form of the crew growing stronger, using their faces and voices to lure the others down. When the captain realized this she prepared an escape pod for the children and surviving crew while setting the ship to a slow self destruct.

*Processing img cgr82fx462hg1...*

One that would be activated once their escape. Seeing as she had already been compromised she sent this message upstairs to the surviving crew and killed herself. However unbeknownst to her the Not Things using her face had ordered the remaining crew to come down, as a second message plays implying all the crew had obeyed save for Jocelyn where the Not Things killed them all. 15 is ecstatic, impressed by the captain’s forethought and sacrifice as he realizes the creatures have no idea what her plan actually was and the self destruct is still primed they just need to get themselves and the children on the escape pod to escape. Ruby asks if they can really do, as bad as the Not Things are can they really just kill them. 15 takes her aside and calmly explains to her that sometimes there are those who words alone cannot reach. Sometimes a Life for a Life needs to be traded, though he promises if he can try to reach them one last time. While this happens baby Eric watches them mouth open gazing glazed. 15 triggers the self destruct sequence. The duo and baby supreme Eric run to the elevator where the Not Thing chases them having now freed himself from the salt– realizing he could just walk around it, taunting the Dr. that’s he’s getting clever! 15 calls him an idiot and the two go back upstairs. 15 informs Jocelyn of the plan and gets everyone to the ship while he plans on making one last trip. Shocked Ruby asks him where he’s going and he claims that’s he going to see the creatures and speak to them one last time. Baby Eric tells him that won’t be necessary as he stands up tall stretching till he can reach the elevator as the other Not Things steps out the door. They had been waiting for some time hoping someone would eventually come and reclaim the cargo/children, even allowing stupid scared Jocelyn to live to take care of their live bait. 15 tries to appeal to them asking them what they are and the Not Things explain they cannot help what they are anymore than he can. The Not Things turn their attention to the children wondering if they’ll have enough room on the escape pod for all of them, angrily Jocelyn grabs a wrench and viciously beats the Not Things back taking them momentarily by surprise, but moments hardly ever last and hers is over. The wrench is thrown away and they prepare to kill her first. Enraged the army of babies rush to defend their Nanny and the creatures begin to grow taking up the room and scaring the bejeezus out of the tiny children. One of the creatures rush past forcing its way into the escape pod while the other declares it was time for the children to die. In a last act of defiance Jocelyn hits the escape pod button launching the creature out into space before the ship can be properly sealed through the window they watch it freeze over. The other Not Thing becomes terrified, enraged and grieving. Jocelyn apologies knowing she’s killed them all, she was angry that they had threatened her children, the babies surround her telling her it’s   


*Processing img lb1gtu9762hg1...*

Alright they know she always does her best. As the self destruct sequence nears its end the Tardis appears and the Dr. ushers everyone onboard women and children first, Ruby calls for the Dr. and he takes her hand pulling her inside only to discover another Ruby already on board. Both proclaiming to be the real Ruby Sundy the Dr. pushes the one he had just taken back out onto the ship and the Tardis flies off, where the Dr. realizes the Ruby he had just saved had been the creature who had immediately switched faces the moment the Tardis appeared. The Tardis returns to the ship where the creature attempts to force the Dr. out when Jocelyn tackles the Not Thing forcing it threw the Tardis. The real Ruby takes the Dr’s hand and together with Jocelyn they pull her back inside the Tardis, Ruby giving the Not Thing a little stomp on the way. As they prepare to leave 15 looks back shouting to the creature he could have at least lied about going with them peacefully, before tearfully telling him I would have saved you. The Not Thing screams growing bigger as the Tardis shakingly vanishes and the ship explodes. 15 scans for a refugee planet and drops the children off and allows Jocelyn to stay with them, apologizing to her for his earlier assumptions, everyone gets scared, that’s where bravery comes from. Returning back to her home 15 regrets having to invoke salt at the edge of the universe fearful of what that could bring. The Tardis groans around him as if in agreement. Ruby thanks him for trying to save the creatures though she is a little shaken after nearly being left. 15 then hands Ruby a Tardis key offering for her to join fulltime on the condition they never visit the night she was born fearful of the paradox it could bring. She accepts but only with a condition of her own, never again will he abandon her and he agrees, never again. As Ruby leaves to go see her family 15 subtly scans her DNA while it begins to snow inside the Tardis. Elsewhere somewhere off in space the frozen Not Thing drifts off into the orbit of a nearby planet…



Easily the most hated episode of the season and maybe even the new era, this episode while not very deterring to us hardcore fans but for general audiences I would wager this one was a death nail. It was clearly aimed at kids, ironically I watched Who at 4/5 years old, my sister started even younger. Neither of us would have loved this show as a kid, we actually responded to it better as adults just because we love this show that much to remain invested. But this episode had to go, the original Booger Monster was not good, in idea or execution. Space Babies is inherently a goofy concept but we can still have fun with it, acknowledge its ridiculousness, if you’re going to bring up the concept, use it! Also, a little bit of subversion by adding in the horror element. By moving the original Wild Blue Yonder villains here and ramping up their cool concept while allowing it to reach its full terrifying extent we have at once a fun, light-hearted and subversively horror filled episode. A much better official way to kick off the season creating an excitement for the next episode.",1,1770028115.0,u_Fun_Debate_6534,0,1.0,False

Hi everybody!

First post in this sub, only recently started integrating HA in my flat and am loving it so far! 

 

So glad to hear I‘m not the only one facing spouse approval struggles haha

I‘ve got following use case in the kitchen that I want to automate and need some help/inspiration with.

I often listen to podcasts, while cooking, cleaning, or preparing breakfast. The kitchen can get noisy though, I‘ll give you an example of a realistic morning routine:

\-Starting a podcast

\-Boiling water for coffee

\-Stopping the podcast cause the boiler is too loud

\-Restarting after the water is done

\-Grinding coffee

\-Stopping and restarting again 

\-Frying an egg and turning on the extractor hub

\-Stopping and restarting again

The thing is, I wouldn‘t mind if it was music, but if I leave the podcast running (instead of stopping and restarting) I‘ll almost certainly have to rewind to the last audible part, cause I‘ll have lost the track of the conversation or story.

My idea to solve this would be a meter (similar to the humidity/temperature sensors) that measures the noise level in the kitchen, that triggers an automation that stops the podcast when its too noisy and gets it going when it reaches audible levels.

What are your experiences or recommendations for a use case like this?

If I get it running I‘ll post a video of the demo ;)

Thanks!! Have a great week everybody :)

With traditional caloric-deficit diets failing for millions due to a biological barrier known as Thermogenic Resistance, CitrusBurn claims to offer a breakthrough solution by targeting dormant Beta-3 adrenergic receptors.

  
This comprehensive **CitrusBurn review** is designed for those looking for an honest, deep-dive into the supplement's effectiveness after long-term use. If you've been seeing the ""orange peel trick"" ads and wondering if it’s worth your time, we’ve broken down everything you need to know.

To give you the most accurate picture, **we used it 90 days** to see how it actually impacts the body over a full three-month cycle.

# What is CitrusBurn?

**CitrusBurn** is a metabolic support supplement that has gained massive traction in early 2026. Unlike traditional ""fat burners"" that rely on heavy stimulants and caffeine to force the heart rate up, CitrusBurn focuses on **thermogenesis** and **appetite awareness** using citrus-derived botanicals.

The product is often linked to the ""Orange Peel Method,"" a nutritional philosophy that uses specific compounds found in citrus rinds to trigger the body’s natural fat-burning pathways.

# Key Product Details

* **Form:** Powdered drink mix (usually one scoop per day).
* **Primary Focus:** Metabolic health, appetite control, and steady energy.
* **Stimulant Profile:** Low to stimulant-free (no ""jitters"").
* **Target Audience:** Adults 35+ struggling with ""stubborn"" midsection fat.

# The ""We Used It 90 Days"" Timeline

Most reviews are written after a week. However, metabolic supplements require time to saturate the system. Here is our experience across a full 90-day window.

# Phase 1: Days 1–30 (The Priming Stage)

The first month is rarely about weight loss; it's about **internal adjustment**.

* **Energy Levels:** We noticed a subtle lift in morning energy without the ""crash"" associated with coffee.
* **Bloating:** By day 14, there was a significant reduction in digestive bloating.
* **Cravings:** The late-night ""snack brain"" began to quiet down.
* **Weight Change:** Minimal (0–2 lbs).

# Phase 2: Days 31–60 (The Momentum Stage)

This is when the ingredients, particularly the **Synephrine** and **Berberine-like** compounds, begin to show visible results.

* **Metabolism:** We felt ""warmer"" after taking the scoop—a sign of active thermogenesis.
* **Clothes Fit:** This is the phase where belts moved in one notch.
* **Mental Clarity:** Focus improved, likely due to stabilized blood sugar levels.
* **Weight Change:** 4–6 lbs (steady, non-aggressive loss).

# Phase 3: Days 61–90 (The Transformation Stage)

By the end of the third month, the body's baseline metabolism seemed to have reset.

* **Satiety:** We found ourselves getting full on smaller portions naturally.
* **Body Composition:** The most noticeable change was in the ""stubborn"" areas—the lower abdomen and waistline.
* **Final Result:** A total of **12–15 lbs lost** over the 90-day period without extreme dieting.

# CitrusBurn Ingredients: What’s Under the Hood?

The efficacy of CitrusBurn comes from its specific botanical blend. Here are the heavy hitters:

1. **Bitter Orange Extract (p-Synephrine):** Boosts thermogenesis (fat burning) without increasing blood pressure like ephedrine does.
2. **Green Tea Extract (EGCG):** A potent antioxidant that helps oxidize fat cells.
3. **Citrus Bioflavonoids:** These help reduce inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity.
4. **Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) Powder:** Aids in digestion and keeps blood sugar spikes in check after meals.
5. **Berberine/Cofactors:** Often included to help the body manage glucose more efficiently.

# Is CitrusBurn a Scam or Legit?

There is a lot of noise surrounding CitrusBurn. Based on our 90-day trial, the product is **legit**, but it suffers from ""marketing hype.""

* **The Reality:** It will not make you lose 30 lbs in a week.
* **The Scam Warning:** Be wary of 3rd party sellers on unauthorized sites. They often sell ""watered down"" versions or knock-offs. Always buy from the **official CitrusBurn portal** to ensure you get the real formula and the 60-day or 180-day money-back guarantee.

# Final Verdict: Is It Worth It?

If you are looking for a ""magic pill,"" CitrusBurn isn't it. However, if you are looking for a **metabolic tool** to support a moderately healthy lifestyle, it is excellent.

After **we used it 90 days**, the most impressive takeaway wasn't just the weight loss—it was the **lack of food obsession**. It takes the ""white-knuckle"" effort out of dieting by naturally curbing your appetite.

1qtrcwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/1000lbsisters/comments/1qtrcwt/my_thoughts_on_tammy_and_amy/,My thoughts on Tammy and Amy,"I have been thinking about Tammy and Amy and this is what I've come up with. Tammy and Amy have always had each other to depend on. They would fight and then make up because they were dependent on each other. So growing up they leaned on each other. They did everything together. They have said the 3 older siblings weren't around.Then came marriage and the children. Amy married Michael and he did everything for them. He drove them  wherever they wanted to go. He was doing errands, taking them to doctor appts., plus he worked a full time job while the sisters sat in the house and only going out as needed. The kids came along and Amy and Tammy were in separate homes but as close as you can get. Amy decided that Michael wasn't doing anything and she decided to get divorced. When Tammy and Amy got mad at Amanda Tammy said she didn't want anything to do with Amanda anymore. Amy said well I need to because I need them to drive me where I need to go. The sister's would fight and get back together because they needed each other. After Michael was gone they needed the family for rides, and to do errands etc..Their family came to help them. Amy said that they weren't doing anything for HER in her opinion. Tammy was the same. The family did nothing for HER in her opinion.

So in comes Brian and Andrea. I don't think Amy loves Brian. She likes Brian doing everything that Michael used to do for her. Brian takes care of the boys, cooks, cleans, has a job, drives Amy wherever she needs to go. Amy found that she didn't need Tammy to lean on anymore or the family. In my opinion she doesn't love him. She uses him. When/if the marriage goes belly up she will need the family. And she will need Tammy again to lean on. Tammy has Andrea and I don't think she loves Andrea. Tammy isn't having to depend on Amy or the family. In HER opinion neither Amy or the family has done anything for her. Andrea cooks, cleans (guessing since we've not seen her and Tammy's home)drives Tammy wherever she wants to go. But! What happens when Andrea get fed up with Tammy? Andrea admitted to Amy that she has seen Tammy's angry/bitchy ways. What happens when Andrea says I've had enough goodbye? Tammy is going to want Amy to be there for her support. Tammy and Amy will have to make up with each other as they always had because they needed each other. In my opinion the sister's are using their partner's (now husband for Amy).

I'm guessing that Amy and Tammy have made up because I've seen a clip of Tammy running up behind Amy and Brian. Now Andrea has told Amy at hers and Tammy's make up try at the coffee shop that she had seen Tammy's wrath. So how long will Andrea stick around?What if  Brian gets fed up with Amy's needy butt and walks?

These 2 ladies don't need each other and/or their family at least for now. Until they are alone they won't make up as they had in the past. They aren't dependent on each other and don't/won't make up as easily before because the use of family isn't of used to them. I have a hard time with Amy because I've watched her in videos smoking around her kids and her dirty feet and home. Amy forgot herself in one of the talking heads and didn't say a word wrong. So I look at Amy differently these days and don't find her all that funny. 

Tammy is the same Tammy you can't take the ugly out of person. I think Tammy thinks about things before strikes/talking at times so she doesn't come off as bitchy.  Andrea has seen the bitchy side of Tammy. So Tammy is probably going to wind up alone. Amy will more then likely will be alone.Then when they are both single they will lean on each other again. 

 My opinion is that Tammy and Amy has learned to use people until they don't want them around anymore.

While there are several possible paths, in recent years, franchises have gained significant traction as one of the safest, most practical, and most attractive alternatives.

In this article, we explore why franchises have become the ideal gateway for those who wish to start a business in the United States while also securing their immigration status under the E-2 Visa.

# Why Is a Franchise Such a Popular Option for the E-2 Visa?

A franchise offers a proven business model with standardized processes and the backing of an established brand. Unlike starting a business from scratch, where the risk is higher, a franchise provides the investor with:

1. **An established system:** Operations manuals, training, and ongoing support.
2. **Brand recognition:** Making it easier to attract customers from day one.
3. **A shorter learning curve:** Since the parent company has already tested the business model.
4. **More confidence from USCIS and consular officers:** Because it is an operational and viable business that aligns more closely with E-2 Visa requirements.

In short, a franchise helps demonstrate that the investment is not only substantial but also capable of generating jobs and contributing to economic growth in the United States.

# E-2 Visa Requirements and How Franchises Meet Them

To understand why franchises are so attractive, it’s important to review the main requirements of the E-2 Visa:

* The investment must be substantial and made in a real, active business.
* The investor must have control of the company (at least 50% ownership).
* The business cannot be marginal — it must generate sufficient income to support the investor and their family.
* The investor must be directly involved in the management or development of the business.

A franchise naturally meets these criteria: it requires a significant investment, is an ongoing business, often generates jobs, and allows the investor to actively participate in operations.

# Examples of Popular Franchises for E-2 Investors

Although the options are broad, certain industries have become favorites among E-2 investors:

* **Restaurants and coffee shops:** Fast food or casual dining chains with consistent demand.
* **Cleaning and maintenance services:** Businesses with low seasonality and high recurrence.
* **Early childhood education and childcare:** A growing industry in many U.S. cities.
* **Gyms and wellness centers:** Particularly attractive in densely populated urban areas.
* **Mobile or home-based services:** Such as repair, painting, or landscaping.

The key is to choose a franchise that not only meets E-2 Visa requirements but also aligns with the investor’s profile and skills.

# Additional Advantages of Choosing a Franchise for Your E-2 Visa

Beyond the obvious benefits, there are other reasons why franchises are an excellent gateway to the E-2 Visa:

* **Easier access to financing:** Banks are often more willing to lend to proven business models.
* **Clear documentation:** Franchises often provide financial statements, projections, and market studies, which simplifies the immigration application process.
* **Legal and administrative support:** Many franchises have experience working with foreign investors.
* **Lower risk of failure:** Although there are no guarantees, statistics show that franchises tend to succeed more often than independent businesses.

# Challenges and Considerations Before Choosing a Franchise

While attractive, franchises are not a magic solution. They also present challenges that you should consider:

1. **High initial costs:** Some franchises require significant investments.
2. **Royalty and fee payments:** These can reduce profit margins.
3. **Less flexibility:** As part of a network, the investor must follow the franchisor’s rules.
4. **Strategic location:** Choosing the wrong location can directly affect the success of the business.

For these reasons, it is essential to seek specialized legal and financial advice before committing to a franchise.

# Success Stories: Franchises as a Springboard to the American Dream

Consider the case of an investor from Argentina who decides to open a coffee shop franchise in Miami. Thanks to brand recognition, they quickly attract customers, employ five people, and demonstrate to immigration authorities that their investment is substantial and not marginal.

Another example is a couple from Colombia who invest in a cleaning services franchise in Texas. With support from the franchisor, they expand to several cities within a few years, strengthening not only their business but also their lives in the United States under the E-2 Visa.

# Franchises as Your Gateway to the E-2 Visa

Franchises represent one of the safest and most effective ways to meet E-2 Visa requirements, reduce risk, and increase your chances of success in the competitive U.S. market.

Read This Guide First Before Check-in,"Hey folks! If you’re flying with Air Canada soon and dreading the airport chaos, here’s a simple breakdown of how to actually check in — without sweating it at the last minute. I’ve put this together from the latest Air Canada procedures and tips from frequent flyers 



3 Easy Ways to Check In



1. Online Check-In (Best Option)

You can check in from 24 hours before departure right on Air Canada’s website or mobile app. This lets you:

Choose/change your seat

Add or pay for checked bags

Get your boarding pass early (print or mobile)

Do it from home, your hotel, or even on a coffee break — way faster than the airport lines.



2. Mobile App Check-In (Super Convenient)

Using the Air Canada app is probably the easiest. You check in right there, save your boarding pass to your phone, and skip printing. It’s active from about 24 hours before and works up until check-in deadlines.



3. At the Airport (Backup or If You Can’t Online)

If online/app check-in doesn’t work or isn’t available (e.g., itinerary quirks, special needs, pets), head to:



Self-service kiosk — opens about \~12 hours before departure

Check-in counter — for tickets, docs, or help from an agent



Deadlines You Should Know

Even though online check-in opens at T-24 hrs, make sure you plan for your real airport timings:

Arrive early — at least 2 hrs before domestic flights and 3 hrs before international flights (security, customs, bag drop can take time).

Baggage drop usually closes \~45–60 mins before departure, depending on route and airport.

If you wait until right before departure, you might not get bags checked or even be marked as a no-show.

A Few Handy Tips From Fellow Travellers

🔹 If the app or website gives an error when check-in opens, don’t panic — sometimes AC systems glitch. A lot of folks report it eventually works or you can handle it at the airport kiosk.

🔹 Pre-pay for checked bags during check-in online if you can — it’s usually easier and sometimes cheaper than at the airport. (Reddit reports this is a common tip.)

🔹 For connections or codeshare flights, you might have to check in separately with the other airline first.

1qtqspn,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkKlimekNCLEX/comments/1qtqspn/i_passed_the_nclex_as_a_repeat_test_taker_heres/,I Passed the NCLEX as a Repeat Test Taker – Here’s EVERYTHING I Did and Recommend,"I’m a repeat test taker who finally passed the NCLEX in 86 questions, and I really want to share everything I did because reading posts like this helped me so much while I was studying. 

I highly recommend doing NCLEX Bootcamp's 2 month plan and following the exact schedule they generate for you. It gives you a well-rounded plan for all the major topics and concepts the NCLEX tests you on. Try your best to do questions every single day and work your way up to doing 85 questions daily so that by the time you walk into the real exam, the number of questions doesn’t feel overwhelming. Bootcamp has some of the best rationales I’ve ever seen, so make sure you read every single one, even if you got the question right. Their videos explaining the answers are so helpful too. I also highly recommend doing all 50 of the Bootcamp case studies and watching the video explanations. They really prepare you for NGN style questions. If you don’t understand a concept, their cheat sheets break everything down in such a simple and easy to understand way. I also watched all the Bootcamp crash course videos and did the quizzes after, they are super short and very helpful to review concepts. 

For content review, I truly believe everyone studying for the NCLEX should start with Mark K’s 12 lectures. They’re completely free on Spotify and the notes are free online. I took notes as I listened and made Quizlets for each lecture so I could review them every week. If there’s only one thing you do for NCLEX prep, it should be listening to Mark K. I also watched the Klimek Review YouTube channel with Dr. Sharon—those videos helped so much, and they have content on pretty much everything. Their Top 50 NCLEX drugs playlist is amazing because there’s no way to know every drug, but those ones and the ones Mark K talks about will absolutely show up. I also watched the Beautiful Nursing 1 hour comprehensive review on YouTube, the 2 hour crash review by Your Nursing Space, and Simple Nursing videos with Nurse Mike. Nurse Mike explains things in such a simple and fun way, and even his music videos help you remember random things. There are so many helpful free resources online that you can find with a quick search, so you don’t need to spend a ton of money to learn content.

I also did the Archer Intense Prep Program with Shelley, which is definitely expensive, but it helped me a lot. They give you a 6 week intense study plan plus live two-hour lectures twice a week. You also get two-hour Zoom tutoring sessions twice a week where they go over high-yield topics, question strategies, and any questions you have. My tutor sent weekly feedback videos based on the practice tests I took, which helped me understand my weaknesses better. Even if you don’t get the intense program, at least get the question bank. Do readiness assessments as often as you can if not every single day—Archer says that getting four High or Very High scores in a row gives you a 98% chance of passing. I personally think readiness assessments are way better than CAT exams because they give you a broader range of questions and give you a better see at the likelihood of passing.

Something that helped me a lot was taking my practice tests at the same time my real test was scheduled. After taking readiness assessments, I would look at when I started missing more questions and think about whether that’s when I needed to take a break. It’s really important to see when your performance dips and take a short break, breathe, and then keep going. Also, don’t study in your room every day—you will get distracted or end up scrolling or laying in bed. Go to a coffee shop, the library, or somewhere else to stay focused. Wake up in the morning to study instead of saving it all for the evening. You won’t have enough time to take breaks and still get everything done. Make a schedule and stick to it. Figure out your weaknesses and really work on those areas.

Do not study all day, every day—you will burn out. You have to take care of your mental health or none of the studying will matter. Take breaks, take walks, go to the gym if you can, at least get some fresh air. Hang out with your friends and make time to do things you love, even something small like grabbing a coffee or watching an episode of your favorite show. Maintaining a positive attitude while studying is so important. Surround yourself with good people who make you happy. You do not need extra stress on top of this. Find at least one person you can lean on. It helped me so much to review topics with my nursing school friends. Sometimes we would FaceTime and teach each other concepts in simple ways. Having someone to hold you accountable helps a lot too. I used to send my boyfriend my readiness assessment scores so he could hold me accountable and because he was one od my support systems. Even when I failed, he was supportive and helped me find new resources. Reading Reddit posts from other people also helped me so much—you really don’t feel alone when you see that other people have struggled too.

On test day, do not feel discouraged if you keep getting questions past 85. That doesn’t mean you’re failing—it means you’re still in the game and hovering near the passing line. Stay calm and don’t rush. Read each question slowly and carefully. There were so many times I got practice questions wrong just because I misread the question. Take your time. You have 5 hours for the whole exam, and you absolutely do not need to rush through it.

Lastly, I want to share this Google Drive link full of great free study materials, including the Mark K notes. They really helped me: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dda43n-ob6eNeyOxUWLAlH\_e78smQ1He?usp=share\_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dda43n-ob6eNeyOxUWLAlH_e78smQ1He?usp=share_link)

Overall, be consistent, take care of your mental health, use high yield resources, protect your confidence, and don’t study yourself into the ground. Being a repeat test taker is hard, but it doesn’t mean you can’t pass. Changing the way I studied made all the difference, and I hope my experience helps someone else.

(at the time of diagnosis for GERD) I’ve experienced some of these symptoms as an adult now. i never noticed any trigger foods. just nauseous. i’ve since been diagnosed with functional dyspepsia which is a much bigger explanation for the nausea.

i decided to try weaning off omeprazole to see how my body does, just to test if i ever really needed it in the first place. i started weaning sometime around November of last year. i’m on 40mg and i started opening the capsule and just pouring a couple beads out. i did this in very small increments and raised the amount of dumped beads every 1-2 weeks. i’m currently dumping about half, so im taking roughly 20mg a day. i decided to stop at that for a while before continuing to wean, my gastro doc fixed my prescription to me taking just the 20mg capsule. during the first few weeks of weaning, i had a heartburn that would come and go, nothing severe. but since ive been on the 20mg the last month, i am ***struggling***. most days are decent , but my nausea is really bad. 1-3 times a week i get really bad episodes of intense acid reflux. upper abdomen alll the way up to my throat absolutely on fire. on the verge of vomiting, hot flashes, just miserable. it’s currently 2:30am and im just now feeling normal after waking up at midnight to the start of an episode.

i never actually throw up, just stay on the verge feeling for an hour or a few hours until it passes. pepto or tums don’t even touch the burning i feel during this.

i already eat a fairly GERD friendly diet. i very rarely drink carbonated drinks. i don’t consume alcohol hardly ever either. no coffee. mostly water and occasional juices. i’m vegetarian too. not a lot of red sauces or fried foods much.

just feeling lost, unsure if this is the rebound or if i’m making a mistake coming off of it. my gastro doc did tell me “if you’re having these symptoms are you sure you want to continue to wean?” and i was feeling pretty confident about wanting to do it. she said rebound typically only lasts a couple weeks. the most confusing part is when i have these really strong episodes that ive been having there is no “ah ha!” moment of what i could have eaten to cause it.",2,1770025300.0,acidreflux,1,1.0,False

I was afraid of-course and read a lot of subreddits about it that I wish I hadn’t as it added on to my existing health anxiety. 

But i’m here to tell you my experience and hoping it helps anyone who’s as stressed as me. 

Pre existing conditions: I have Sinus, Asthma and had a recent anaphylactic shock from an allergen. 

Medications I was on: Amoxcillin 1000mg + Clarithromycin 500mg (twice a day) + PPI 

Supplements and additionals: 
1. Chewing mastic gum before meals 
2. Magnesium glyncinate 360mg capsules at night daily 
3.. Drinking yakult/Kefir daily 
4. Very clean home made anti inflammatory diet. 

Avoid: 
- Red meat 
- Processed and ultra processed food 
- Sugar 
- Coffee/Matcha
- Alcohol 
- Takeout! 

My first week was bad, I had severe back pain in the upper left part, lower abdomen pain in the left, and center chest pain. I was also very drained and weak and lost 3-4 kgs already! Anything I ate made me feel uneasy and I couldn’t eat more than 2-3 bites. 

My second week was however very smooth, I stuck to my anti inflammatory diet and continued my medications on time and the process was smooth from that day onwards. 

I did have a little inflammation here and there in my body at times but i avoided any NSAIDs and just used compression and drank warm teas. 

I stopped PPi-s a week before my follow up and I tested negative a month later on Feb 2nd since my initial test. 

I hope that helps and please don’t be worried too much, you will be fine, just eat clean and i’m happy to share my eradication story since you don’t hear many. But there are 😄💕

Get well soon!

1qtqga6,https://i.redd.it/d1elc9l5v1hg1.jpeg,Dear Kaleshi Bua,"Dear Geeta (Kaleshi) Bua,

Writing this here because you are all over the place trying to achieve god knows what. 

Malvika has been an influencer for over a decade and has been called out by her “followers” time and again for her hypocrisy, double standards and delusion in general. She in return has frequently mocked and berated her “fans” by calling them unclean smelly unworthy useless etc and making it clear with multiple stories and reels even that she couldn’t care less about what we say or think about her. 

Time and again you yourself have not only joined the hate wagon so to say but carried out bombshell expose on her when she has been at her lowest - pregnant + divorced….lost her dad + mom sick + daughter sick and multiple other occasions small and insignificant perhaps individually but put together it must have been quite traumatic for her to read all of that coming from her own family rather than random internet strangers.

People here have multiple screenshots of the comments you have left on youtube in the past and more recently how aggressively you started out on reddit when she lost her dad giving out details about her , her mom and her brothers that would have never come out otherwise.

Earlier when people here were telling you to calm down you wanted to show yourself as most rational and fair person who cares only about truth and nothing else whatever the cost.

While airing all that dirty laundry in the public you were all Jhansi ki Rani like not wanting to broker peace through any family member or show them any grace whatsoever.

Currently also you are slitting throats in their defence but also can not help yourself from sprinkling snarky comments every now and then because you know her reality far better than us. 

You know very well you are being fake trying to (and failing miserably) defend her crowd funding/begging/scam/moneylaundering campaign and more importantly her bizzare psychopathic indifference to her own mother dying who has been a maid, cook, nanny and her single source of support in her own words during her divorce and pregnancy and childbirth and subsequently raising abby.

You are randomly threatening people with legal action with your team of lawyers on standby and other crazy shit that seems to be a family trademark.

You love to project yourself as a thorough professional at the forefront of fashion and ui industry accross NY and god knows what all. Now that you have revealed your name, a very simple internet search throws up a lot of personal and professional details about you and tbh deranged is not a good look for a potential client looking to hire you. 

Earlier you considered yourself above Malvika, Jen and the whole clan. Now your online activity shows you licking the ground they are walking upon.

Jen has had cancer for a long time now so this 360 in your attitude is definitely not out of compassion or goodness of your heart. Something has happened behind the scenes which has positioned you into an internet clown.

Last few weeks you have come across as a very desperate, confused and helpless person whos treating this sub as proverbial Gangaji trying to wash of your sins.

Its a request from us to the whole family that please show an iota of maturity and deal with shit amongst yourselves privately. You are old enough to remember how the world existed and functioned before internet. 

Currently YOU ALL are revealing things online in form of screenshots, anecdotes, stories, posts etc etc etc and then trying to damage control once they backfire.

Hire a PR firm if you guys think you are some celebrities. If not then pls shut the F up.

Stop trying to portray people calling out Malvika (for the same shit that you have called her out for on a much larger scale) into some witch-hunt.

Stop projecting your guilt here.

Stop derailing conversations with half facts.

Stop this passive aggression.

Stop this flip flop behaviour.

Stop threatening people with legal consequences.

Stop posting private screenshots of her dead father.

Stop revealing about boob jobs of jen.

Stop revealing what shade of lispstick she wore to the funeral.

Stop revealing which of the boys came for the funeral.

Stop revealing how much of a monster her dad was because he cant defened himself.

Stop bullying Akhils family into helping her.

Stop supporting her makeup thirst traps which are completely inappropriate for the moment.

Stop supporting her making Jen cook on what could very well be her last days.

Stop justifying how Dubai > India for treatment.

Stop justifying how shes doing her best when shes literally doing her absolute worst.

You swore to protect your dead bother from made up accusations. Recently posts and comments were made on the sub about him selling Jens parents property fraudulently which ended up in her father dying. There were accusations that he turned predatory towards Malvika and hence Jen had to run away from him to protect her.

God knows if it was you from you one billion reddit accounts or some other deranged family member/acquaintance making those claims.

You love to obsessively keep screenshots of everything so I am sure it must be there in your black book.

It would be understandable if you were jumping in trying to protect the family from such serious accusations but no. You kept your mouth shut on all of that. But here you are with a sword in each hand defending her gym thrist traps, booty hanging out with curled hair, glossy lips overlined to no end and her coffee runs with all the money she collected from unworthy followers with a fake sob story.

Adding a screenshot here of you simping over Malvikas facebook autoposts the one place she probably forgot to block you from after she blocked you everywhere else on the internet.

To address some stuff said in the episode: 

* Hadden does not have access to the internet. I sent him the main picture of the LPOTL website. I thought it'd make for a unique gift from someone they covered.
* I've been writing to Hadden for over a year and he sends me art frequently. I asked if he'd be interested in a commission and sent a Chipper Jones autograph just to sweeten the deal; Hadden loves collecting autographs.
* Hadden has a major disliking for Michael Bay and the documentary he made. Hadden says it's full of lies and that Mr. Bay broke a contract they made with each other.
* I **did not** request the beard trimmings and coffee prints. I asked for a nice ASL drawing for each of the guys and he included those as well. I sent them because I thought it was weird and ""unique""... and I didn't want them ¯\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I thought Henry might just be wild enough to take them haha
* Hadden constantly writes about how he is in great shape. Really likes reminding me for some reason. Sorry everyone, he might be around for a while.

I’ve been slowly trying to manage my spending for the last 6 months or so. Lately I have been having a little extra money left over by the time my next paycheck hits so I’m not spending it all. However-a big however- I go through these phases of excessive buying so the extra money disappears. whether that’s trying different iced coffees, buying new records, books I won’t read, and skincare I don’t need. these cycles last anywhere from a few days to a couple weeks. it’s frustrating because I’ll do well resisting most unnecessary purchases then I start buying everything I might like. but go figure I hate buying what I need. I finally bought a pair of jeans last week after tearing two pairs and my last pair being close to ripping after 2 years. thankfully Im not huge into online shopping so that alone isn’t a big temptation. funnily enough, I haven’t been going out a lot because I‘ve been sleeping so much due to chronic illness.

I’ll be visiting **Austria for the first time from March 6–12** and would really appreciate some local insight and feedback on my rough plan.​

I’ll **start in Vienna for the first day**, but I’m planning to spend most of my time in **Graz** and potentially do a few day trips to nearby towns or regions if it makes sense (e.g. wine regions, smaller historic towns, scenic spots).

I’m **not** into clubs, bars or partying – I’m coming mainly for **gastronomy, great city views, architecture and history**. So **museums and good food/coffee** are a big priority for me.

Below are the places I’ve bookmarked so far.

I’d love to hear:

* Which ones are actually worth it and which are overrated
* What you would add (restaurants, cafés, museums, viewpoints, day trips)
* Any very local / non‑touristy tips you think a first‑timer shouldn’t miss

Vienna – places I saved

From my Google Maps list, these are on my radar in Vienna:​

* Figlmüller – Restaurant
* Brasserie Palmenhaus
* Manner
* Café Savoy
* Julius Meinl am Graben
* Café Jelinek
* Gerstner K. u. K.
* Demel Vienna Café
* Gastwirtschaft Schilling
* Café Ritter
* Schmetterlinghaus
* Café Central
* Naschmarkt
* Café Sperl
* Kunsthistorisches Museum
* Zum Schwarzen Kameel
* Secession
* Café Hawelka
* Le Burger Rotenturmstraße

Graz – places I saved

For Graz and surroundings, these are the places currently on my list:​

* DIAMOND Pizza – Kebap
* COFFEE & HAUS
* MARTIN AUER
* Bitki
* El Gaucho at Landhaus
* Tribeka
* Graz (city listing itself saved)
* Frankowitsch
* Safran Restaurant
* Glöckl Bräu
* Gulascheck
* Murinsel Graz

Thanks a lot in advance for any suggestions – I really want to experience Austria the way locals enjoy it, not just rush through the typical checklist.",0,1770023588.0,Austria,9,0.33,False

Here’s a well-written, authentic, and conversational Reddit-style post for **r/PaidOnlineJobs** that uses an honest and personal tone — while naturally integrating the link three times for effective visibility and engagement:

**Title:** I Tried “The Brain Song” as a Memory Exercise – Here’s What Happened

Hey everyone,  

So, I recently stumbled across something called *“The Brain Song”* and honestly, I was skeptical at first. The idea that a simple rhythmic track could help boost focus and memory seemed like one of those internet “too good to be true” things. But as someone who works online and spends hours looking at monitors and multitasking, I figured it was worth a try.  

I found it here 👉 [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song), and decided to give it a week. No expectations — just curiosity.  

Day one felt kind of weird; it’s not your typical background music. But by the third day, something surprising happened. I noticed I wasn’t re-reading the same lines of code (or copy) over and over like I usually do. My focus sessions lasted longer. Even when I got distracted, I could jump right back into the flow.  

By the end of the week, I was genuinely impressed. I can’t say it’s magic, but there’s definitely something about pairing rhythm with memory that seems to *wake up* parts of the brain I usually take for granted. Maybe it’s science, maybe it’s placebo — but either way, I’ll take any tool that helps me stay sharp and productive.  

If you’re someone who works online — juggling side gigs, freelancing, or even content creation — I highly recommend giving it a listen. Check it out for yourself here: [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song).  

And one more time for good measure, because this actually helped me focus better than another cup of coffee:  
🔗 [https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song)  

Curious if anyone else has experienced something similar? Do you use any music or methods to improve your memory or concentration while working online?

This week…

On Day 320 I am reminded of the song “Take It To The Limit” by Eagles – not The Eagles – because I am reminded that the leader of the Trump Administration is taking us to the bottom, if there even is a bottom anymore, but when we get there we will know in full what it is like when we put people in power who indulge their worst impulses and empower and encourage their followers to do the same. Why am I pointing this out on a podcast that I say is about being positive? Stay tuned!

Day 321 is for celebrating 22 because on Day 321, we are 22% through 1461 days of ignoring the Trump administration. I mention on this day the disgusting and vile comments that the leader of the Trump administration made about the tragic murder of Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele, and how Rob reminds me of a tangential connection to the number 22. Stay tuned to hear what I’m thinking about that, but for now, let me remind you that when we reach milestones, it is time to reup our commitment to mindfulness, optimism, and hope.

On Day 322, I get to have a little bit of fun with a commenter who thoughtfully asks, ""What's it like to let someone control your everyday life?"" and, although I am not a religious person, I do often wonder what it is like for people who give their lives over to the Lord – or a Lord – which obviously leads me to also wonder, in this case, why a follower of the leader of the Trump administration so willingly and blindly abides by all of this man’s misdeeds while at the same insinuating that it is me who is under the spell of this bag of bones. Like I said, I had a little bit of fun.

On Day 323, we address a very pressing issue among followers of the leader of the Trump administration, and that is whether you are an alpha or a beta. There is a third option that I bring up, which you will have to stay tuned to hear about. I had never heard of this popular rage-bait topic until recently, and I was thoroughly bored when I did. We discuss how these so-called alpha males don’t seem to realize how their delusional sense of self can be interrupted in an instant by the realities of life. Oh, those poor instant betas.

On Day 324, we discuss plaque, and yes, I am talking about oral hygiene. But once I am done detailing my own experience with my dentist and destistry, we quickly move along to why and how this has to do with the leader of the Trump administration. I can’t speak to whatever the hell is going on in this rotting dude’s mouth, but I can speak to the stupid plaques he put up at the White House to disparage former presidents because, of course he did. These are the actions of an asshole. See how much more I can say on this dedicated podcast!

Day 325 is one of my favorite days in the series. I address a commenter named Drummer Jimmy71, who is a drummer in a Def Leppard tribute band. I tease him, telling him that I am impressed with his dedication to authenticity by removing one of his arms to emulate, impersonate, and accurately portray Def Leppard’s actual drummer, Rick Allen. This drumming disciple of the leader of the Trump administration told me the next day that he loved the video. That made me feel good.

On Day 326, we wrap up the week with me coining the word ""depreshing,"" a combination of depression and depressing that I said accidentally and liked. Stay tuned for a discussion of this word that I hope you will consider incorporating into your own vocabulary, and if you are a marketing person, into your daily corporate speak. The reason I felt “depreshed” was because of the holidays, which I hate. If you hate them too, I hope you will be able to relate to what I am saying, and if you don’t, maybe buy me a coffee to convince me otherwise.",1,1770023186.0,JoshBloom,0,1.0,False
1qtq4z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qtq4z6/i_have_have_night_terrors_and_when_i_wake_up/,"I have have night terrors, and when I wake up, someone is always there to lull me back to sleep.","It’s embarrassing to say, but I was tucked into bed probably until the end of middle school. I had these terrible night terrors that really made it hard to fall asleep on my own. It’d be multiple times a night I’d wake up, then be unable to fall back asleep, so often my parents would just regularly come in and help me do so. My father stopped aiding with the nightly bedtime rituals pretty quickly, telling me I needed to grow up even though I was like seven at the time, but my mother continued way into my teenage years. I think he only expected to be having to get up regularly in the middle of the night when I was a toddler. 

At first it was the typical bed time story, or she’d read a chapter from a book or something like that to me, but as I moved into the final years of elementary school and into middle school she ended up just sitting there with me, talking with me, or sometimes reviewing flash cards and other study materials for school until I fell asleep. Bed time stories fell out of style. 

It was about when I started my freshman year of high school that those nightly rituals stopped. It wasn’t because I didn’t want them anymore. I wasn’t worried about being cool (surprisingly), or just didn’t need them anymore, I still very much needed the aid. 

It was because my mother had to pick up a second job. A nightshift. My father left the picture around middle school and just stopped supporting me and my mother all around. We think he left the country. Her salary as a teacher wasn’t enough on its own, and I had hit the age where I could take care of myself fairly well for dinner and things like that.

We started medicating me to help me sleep, which my mother had always been against, but due to our current situation she was left with no choice. I was glad to start them though. I guess before, although I said I wasn’t worried about being cool, I think I was a little. The idea of being able to finally switch away from the childlike coddling at night felt like a big step forward in my life. 

While it helped me fall asleep at first, their effects started to weaken. I couldn’t really do anything about it. I guess I could have taken another pill, but instead I’d often just lay and stare at the ceiling, waiting for my mom to come home. I hoped that she would pop her head in, and sometimes she did, and those times she’d lull me back to sleep, but more often than not I wouldn’t see her until the sun rose the next morning.  Both of us were failing to get any sleep at all. And it showed.

I was falling asleep in almost every class, my grades were dropping, and my ability to play football for the school’s team was waning. I got kicked off anyway due to my falling grades, but it didn’t matter much, I don’t know if at that rate I would have been able to continue. Getting kicked off was much better than becoming a bench warmer.

My mother just slept when she wasn’t working. She also stopped popping her head into my room to make sure I hadn’t woken up in the middle of the night. She told me the same thing my dad did at one point. To just grow up, take my meds and deal with it. It wasn’t like my mother at all. 

While her perpetual weariness helped her easily fall asleep, mine meant nothing. Maybe I had a little insomnia or something like that, but I had never been diagnosed for it. My mother had talked to people at the school and a few different doctors about doing a sleep study, but we never went through with it. 

That was because I began getting my sleep again. Even though I was still waking up in the middle of the night, I was easily able to fall back asleep.

When I’d wake up, sweaty and shaking like a scared little dog with his tail between his legs, I’d always see someone sitting at the end of my bed. In the darkness it was often hard to make out, at first I just assumed it was my mom.

The silhouette at the end of my bed had long hair, down to her hips, which was odd. At one point my mother had similar, very long hair, but she cut it for the purpose of her second job. At that time, her hair should have been about half that length. Everything else was about the same though; her long night gown she always wore to bed and her slightly plump figure, it was the spitting image. Well, at least through my groggy, sleep deprived eyes. Then it spoke to me.

“You’re alright…” It said to me. It sounded like my mother too, but its voice was a little raspy. Sounded like if my mother had been a lifetime smoker.

It reached its hand out to me. Its body didn’t move, it stayed upright, didn’t look at me, far away at the end of the bed. But its arm extended with this soft cracking and crunching sound, like stepping on little twigs and dead leaves while hiking through the cool fall woods. It touched me with a cold hand, wiped a tear from my cheek. Everything about it should have scared me, but I felt calm, and I was almost immediately getting drowsy. 

“Have I ever told you about the cat and the mouse?” It asked me. 

“No…” I yawned. 

“Well, there used to be this little mouse that ran about my house. It ate all my food and would leave little droppings all throughout my house. So I got a cat. But the cat was lazy, it didn’t want to chase the mouse. The mouse continued to eat all my food and so too did the cat. The cat got fat and the mouse got fatter.” She told me. 

It was about at that point her words began to get mumbled, and I began to drift off back to sleep. She continued her story about her cat and mouse, but I was barely making any of it out. More stuff about eating and getting fat. Sounded like that was basically the whole story anyway, so I don’t think I missed out on much.

I didn’t see my mom the following morning. Normally she’d be around with a slice of peanut butter toast and a little coffee for me, ready to send me off to school. But she wasn’t there. I just got all that stuff myself and got on with my day. If I were to see her, it’d be around dinner time as she popped into the house to get ready for her second job. 

And that I did, I saw her as she tiredly stumbled into the house and sat down at the kitchen counter. I hadn’t ever seen her like that before. I knew she was tired all the time, working two jobs, one a very stressful job, the second I didn’t know much about. Suppose I had seen her crash on the couch from time to time, guess how tired she was never really hit me until I saw her awake. 

She walked in like she was drunk, her eyes almost completely shut, her steps a little irregular. It felt like I was looking at my dad for a second. She rested her head on the cold counter and looked at me. Smiled softly. It was a sad sight.

“What's for dinner tonight, my baby boy?” She asked. There was a bit of a rasp in her voice, but her hair was just as short as I had remembered it being.

“I made spaghetti.” I told her, filling my plate. Once I had a mountain of undercooked pasta and overcooked meatballs, I moved to sit next to her.

“It smells good.” She said as she stretched a little and sat upright.

“Do you want some?” 

“No, thank you though. They had pizza at the conference. I think I ate too much, my stomach's hurting a little.” She let out an exaggerated, deep exhale. 

We sat in silence for a moment. But the thought of the story last night, the person at the end of my bed, was still churning in my mind. It had been all day. Maybe I was a little mad at my mom at the moment. She now seemed like herself, despite her exhaustion. 

I knew my mom was tired and overworking, but it didn’t mean I didn’t like her change of attitude. Probably a little teen angst. I felt I was seeing my mom change into my dad. There was a mix of emotions with her attitude towards my sleep problems, a sadness watching her kill herself over her work, and her sober drunkenness as she crashed on the couch all the time and stumbled tiredly throughout the house.

More so, I think I was mad at myself for being such a problem to her, a burden, but I took it out on her at that moment.

“What was with that stupid story about the cat and the mouse?” I set my fork down and looked over at her. 

“What?” She furrowed her brow in confusion. 

“Well, I don’t know, you say just the exact same thing dad said to me when I was seven god damn years old! ‘Grow up’, then you put me on these meds and just send me to bed, that's not like you! And-and…” I pause, stuttering a little, trying not to cry as I spout my mess of emotions. “You stopped helping me when I needed you, you stopped checking on me at night! Then all the sudden you decide to help me again? Tell me a stupid story about a cat and mouse eating food and getting fat?”

She just stared at me in silence. The confusion on her face had faded and there was a great sadness washing over her. 

“You’re turning into dad! All inconsistent, never around, what's next, you going to disappear on me too?” 

And that was that. I said what I shouldn’t have said. But I said it. I said the worst thing I could have said to my mother. A woman who I know was giving her all to take care of me. Giving her life almost. But in my anger I stabbed deep.

“You know we don’t use words like ‘damn’ in this house.” She said to me as tears clearly entered her eyes. “I have to get ready for work.”

She didn’t yell back anything. She never was the kind of person to argue with me, or anyone for that matter. Even when my dad was terrible to her and to me, she never argued. She criticized for sure, but never truly argued. 

And I felt terrible. That may have been my one chance to properly talk with my mom that I would have gotten in the next month or so, and I ruined it. And too now, I knew that that thing last night wasn’t my mother. 

She quickly left after barely freshening up. I hadn’t moved from the kitchen counter, I didn’t look at her as she left. It was silent throughout the house, I just stared at the oven across from me. My eyes kept spinning around and around the dials. I was still trying to hold back my tears, but it was inevitable. They came, pouring out as strong as the falls of Niagara. I ran to my room and just jumped into bed.

I never fell asleep. I heard my mom come in around three in the morning. I watched her shadow pass my room. That was about the same time the stranger appeared again.

The weight of their body was definitely heavier than before. Just barely, but just enough that I could tell. Their arms cracked and popped outward towards my face again. Rubbing my cheek and wiping the tears away that just wouldn’t stop. 

“It’s alright…” They consoled me. Their voice sounded the exact same as the previous night, almost like a video being replayed. 

“It’s not alright.” I mumbled.

“Have I ever told you about the cat and the mouse?” It asked me. 

“You told me about it last night.” I told it.

It began retelling the story. Every word was spoken the exact same way. I felt myself getting drowsy at about the exact same point in the story. And without meds, I fell asleep. I knew it wasn’t my mother. But the way I felt at that moment, made me care not about what it was. 

It felt like a mother, and that was enough. 

It went on for about a week. Every night it would tell me the same story, every night it spoke the exact same way. Same intonations, the same pace of speech, the exact same words spoken every night. Even the way it caressed my face was the exact same. I think the way my tears fell down my face, they may have even been following the same path towards my chin, every single time.

Every night too, the weight of their body was always just a little heavier on the end of my bed. Every night, the mattress dipped deeper around her. Over the week too, a small indentation began to form at the corner of the bed she always sat at. The creek of my wooden bedframe became a bit heavier each time she appeared too, as her body would sink into the mattress. 

Eventually I got to hear the next part of the story. It was about half way through the second week of her presence at night. I wasn’t getting as sleepy as fast anymore, though I was still very tired. It took me a little longer for my eyes to close and my ears to shut out any noise around me.

“...My fridge became emptier and emptier. And I became skinny. My fat cat was taking all my food, and so was the fatter mouse. I wanted to eat so, so very bad. My stomach would growl and growl, like an angry dog. But I let the mouse eat more and more, and I let the cat eat more and more too. Until there was nothing left in the fridge…” Her story continued. It was at about that point where I drifted off. 

Every night I would fall asleep there for about another week or so. During that week my mom and I never really saw each other. Maybe I was avoiding her without thinking, maybe she was avoiding me. Maybe it was both. 

We finally crossed paths on a similar day. She had a later start to her night job, and got home around dinner time from work at the local school. I was cooking spaghetti again, the noodles still under cooked, and the meatballs still over cooked. I loaded my plate up, and sat next to her at the kitchen counter. The silence between us was heavy for a moment, until she spoke.

“My grandma used to tell me that story. About the cat and the mouse…” She said.

“That’s cool…” I replied. 

“It was a really weird story, a little messed up for me to be hearing when I was five.” She snagged a noodle from my plate and slurped it up. “It’s good. But you need to cook the noodles a little longer.”

“I like them like that.” I told her.

She let out a sigh while I just stared down at my plate.

“You know, I would never leave you.” She choked a little on her words. “I can’t really explain what happened with your father, I’m not really sure what happened to begin with. He’s always been like that. Even when we were dating all the way back in high school. My mother, your grandmother, was like that too. She would care when it felt like the time to care, and when that time passed, she would just stop. She’d get cold and harsh with her words and actions. 

“When you were born, she took up that caring mantle. A little too much. She was always so overbearing with you. She would fight me on who would bathe you, who would change your diaper. From what I remember my father telling me, she was never like that with me. Maybe she wanted to care properly for a change, but it all came off wrong. 

“I was surprised she didn’t try to breast feed you.” She laughed, although it was clear it was hurting her to talk about this. “To an extent, I’m glad she passed while you were still young. I fear what kind of woman she would have turned into.”

“I’m sorry I was so awful to you the other day.” I told her. “I’m just…”

“I know.” She paused. “My salary has gone up at work. So I think I’m going to quit my other job. I know recently I haven’t been the best. And I hope you’ll forgive me. I’m always so scared I’ll turn into someone like my mother was, and for a moment I was scared I’d turn into someone like your father. But I would never hurt you, I never want to hurt you. I’m just trying to be the best mom I can be. And sometimes that's hard.”

I didn’t know what to say. Her hand rested on my shoulder gently and she gave it a squeeze. 

“It’ll only be a few more weeks that I’ll be working the second job, I’m going to put my two weeks in today.” She stood up, “do you want me to tuck you in tonight?”

“Y-yeah…” I stuttered. “That’d be nice.”

So, I got ready for bed and she came in a little after. She sat close next to me, looking down at the foot of my bed.

“You know, when we did this when you were around four, she would sit at the edge of the bed, while I sat around this close to you.” She grabbed my hand that was resting on my chest. I just stared into the ceiling. “Of course not this same bed, a much smaller one, but I would tell you a bed time story and she would always chime in. There was only one time she told you that story, about the cat and the mouse, but I cut her off once I realized what she was saying. I stopped letting her come in and help with bedtime after that.

“You were right, it is a stupid story, a stupid and very terrible story.”  She took a look at the alarm clock on my nightstand and stood up. “I’ll come in and check on you once I get off work. Don’t forget to take your pills.”

She gave me a kiss on the forehead and left to go get ready. I sat up and looked down at the little indent in my bed by my feet. I remembered my grandma being around, but not like that. Maybe as a little toddler I didn’t really think much of it. But what I did remember was how she was always there, no matter what we were doing. 

Even after taking my pills, it took me a moment to drift off to sleep. My mind was racing with thoughts of my mother, my father, and now my grandma too. To an extent, it almost felt like I was an extra burden on my mother. If my father was always like that, like someone who was only a lover or a father when it was convenient to him; and my grandmother, overburdening her love on me and being a terrible mother, what else would have been weighing down on my mom?

Maybe it was me that was weighing on her. But that was my own brain talking. I knew that much. Having my mother by my side like that once more felt nice. It felt a little stupid at my age, but it was nice. I was still trying to balance the worries of being uncool with the idea of wanting my mother by my side. Did I care or did I not care? I suppose nobody would know unless they were stalking me. 

I awoke again around three, sweating profusely and my eyes watering. And there it was, sitting at the end of my bed. Everything played out the same as it always does. Its cracking arms reached towards me, it carefully wiped my tears as it began telling the same story. But I didn’t say anything to it. 

I was struggling to fall asleep, so that time, I heard the final part of the story.

“And since the food was now all gone, the three of us became hungrier and hungrier. The cat finally began to look at the mouse. Its fat body looking like a juicy piece of meat. Its round tummy growling. ‘Oh feed me, Mr. Cat, I am getting empty,’ the cat’s tummy told the cat. I began to look at the cat, it too looked like a big, juicy piece of meat. 

“‘I am getting empty!’ My tummy told me. As for the mouse, there was nothing it could eat, no where it could move. So the cat finally pounced, and ripped the poor mouse apart. It ate and it ate until now the cat too couldn’t move. His belly too big, and his legs too short. But he was happy, and he slowly fell asleep, his belly now satisfied. And that's… when I pounced!” Her hands that were once caressing my face were now digging into my cheeks. I braced myself for it to jump on me, but it just kept facing the wall while its twisted and elongated arms tore into the skin of my cheeks.

My face started to burn as its grip grew tighter and tighter on my face. I reached up and grabbed for her hands, trying to pull them off of my face. That once calming feeling that would always wash over me, lull me back to sleep, was now replaced with a panic. 

I kicked and pulled but she was too strong. Slowly her head began to turn to me, her long hair shifting across the top of my bed. I wanted to scream but through the pain in my face and snotty, scared tears, I found myself choking on my breaths. 

“And I tore…” she slowly continued her story, “and I tore… and I tore up the cat. Its meat was so, so tasty, and my tummy was so, so happy…” 

I heard someone coming down the hall, my mom was home. She slowly began to approach my door. It seemed it heard too, as there was a pause in its movements. It finally stopped digging into my face, its head froze just barely inches away from finally facing me. Its hair stopped shifting, falling a little off the side of the bed and swaying just a little before it came to a pause. My bedroom door began slowly creaking open, and I finally was able to call out.

“MOM!” I screamed at the top of my lungs. It was enough to send my mother into a panic and she busted the rest of the way through the door.

“What's wrong-” Her eyes quickly shifted to it sitting on the end of my bed, and she let out an ear piercing shriek. 

Quickly, its body twisted and turned, its long hair and elegant gown flowing beautifully in contrast to its jerky, aggressive movements as it turned to face my mother.  In a split moment, it shifted its hunger from me to my mother, and pounced. 

I watched, in my fear and panic unsure of what to do. The sounds of tearing flesh and shrill, pained screams filled my room, bounced down the halls of my house, and out into the dark of the night. 

The mess of hair and gown that flowed over my mother like a blanket began to turn red. My breaths hastened and I could feel my face going numb. It was my mother’s words that broke me from my trance.

“Run!” She commanded. And so I did. I ran out of the house and into the night. The closest neighbors had heard the commotion and their lights came on. I went to their homes and began banging on the doors until one finally came to answer. I told them my mother was being attacked and they quickly came to aid. But it was too late. By the time the police arrived and we had returned to the scene, there was almost nothing left. 

I went into care under my uncle and aunt. But they were so estranged it almost felt like I was in foster care. We held a funeral for my mother, but it felt meaningless. What was the point of burying someone if there was only a hand left to bury. 

It's been a few years since then. Surprisingly my night terrors have calmed down. But I keep seeing every night, in the corner of my room, I keep seeing it. Its long flowing hair, its summer night gown, and its disgusting, bulbous gut. I just hope it doesn’t get hungry again any time soon.",9,1770023143.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Markets like coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton, and wheat can move pretty hard, and often for very real reasons weather issues, crop reports, export policies, or even currency moves. A bad harvest or supply disruption can change the whole outlook overnight.

What I find interesting is that these moves aren’t always purely technical. Seasonality and fundamentals seem to matter more here than in many other markets, which makes them both interesting and risky if you’re not paying attention.

Just curious does anyone here trade or follow soft commodities?",1,1770022897.0,Trading,0,1.0,False

I personally love matcha (can't drink coffee because of the jitters so this does the caffeine trick for me and I am into the taste as well), but I’m still at the early stages of making it properly at home. I usually buy matcha drinks outside and want to start preparing it myself and really explore it properly. I usually drink it in the form of an iced latte.

My friend, however, know*s \*nothing\** about matcha 😅 so I’m trying to give him a clear shopping list.

I’d love recommendations for:

* **Good quality matcha** that’s worth buying in Japan
* **Matcha tools/accessories** (chasen/whisk, chawan/bowl, scoop, etc.)
* **Complete kits** if those are better for beginners

I’m especially interested in things that are:

* Hard to find outside Japan
* Or significantly better quality than what’s commonly available abroad (I’m based in India)

If possible, I’d also really appreciate:

* Specific **stores in Tokyo** (not necessarily touristy ones)
* Or areas where matcha tools/tea shops are concentrated

# The Problem: Search Engines Hate Confusion

Imagine you write an article. It lives at `yourblog.com/best-coffee-tips`. Great.

Now you repost it with a new title and image. It lives at `yourblog.com/morning-coffee-hacks`. Same core content, fresh packaging.

Google crawls both pages. Sees similar content. Now it has a decision to make: which one is the “real” version? Which one should rank?

Without guidance, Google guesses. Sometimes it picks the original. Sometimes it picks the repost. Sometimes it picks neither and ranks a competitor instead because it’s confused about your authority.

**That’s the problem canonicals solve**.

1qtq04v,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qtq04v/grinder_input_low_budget/,Grinder input - low budget.,"Hello!  
  
I've been on and off with specialty coffee for a while, but I am a nerd at heart, so the analysis and deep-diving offered by the pour-over and espresso-communities is very endearing to me. So I read, watch and follow a lot of content not directly useful to me (I cannot make espresso, for instance - but have probably watched at least 100 videos on it). 

I am looking to get a grinder upgrade from the one I own - a very old model of Wilfa Svart. My normal uses are pour over for 1-2 people (mostly chemex, but I want to get a Hario Switch eventually) and aeropress. 

Budget would be around 150-300 dollars (the reason the gap is so big is due to me living in Norway, and most gear either has an import tax, or if I can buy it from stores in-country it is often more expensive). My research has led me to these thoughts:

Shardor, with plans of swapping to Cast V3 SSP-burrs within a year or so, seems like a good option. This would allow for pour-over and manual espresso, if that time comes - and it is very budget friendly as a start. I would maybe be able to swing a Fellow Ode Gen 2, but that would push the budget \*and\* exclude espresso down the line - but I have heard very good things about the gen 2 burrs it comes with. I have also been eyeing a KINGrinder K6, which has a smaller capacity, but produces good cups while being very budget friendly. I have never tried manual grinders - so I am a bit hesitant towards this option. 

So, I have some ideas, but in the world of reviews and grinders and opinions - it's easy to miss information. So I am asking for input, and constructive criticism of my ideas so far! 

  
Two addons: 

\- It would be excellent if the grinder could also do larger doses (45-60 grams of beans), since I do make batch brews from time to time when we have visitors. 

\- I would love if I could use the grinder for manual espresso down the line, if I ever get the budget to purchase one (robot or flair).

About Me:

•	⁠24, 5’1 ft, black hair and dark brown eyes. I have naturally broad shoulders and would say I have a more athletic built due to my sports

•	⁠I enjoy Muay Thai and CrossFit. Lol. Sorry. Not into pickleball or pilates here.

•	I love traveling and going on solo trips

•	⁠Cafe hunting and food trips would be great! But I love a good iced matcha since I stopped drinking coffee years ago. Sorry.

•	⁠I value a healthy and active lifestyle too

About You:

•	⁠As a personal preference: 5’10-6ft and above, mestizo (for the physical aspect but I’m open to whoever is interested), 28-35 would also be ideal for the age. But if you’re about 26-27, that’s fine. Younger guys won’t be entertained. :)

•	⁠Someone who also does sports or has an active gym lifestyle so we can both match and understand each other more

•	⁠Respectful, emotionally intelligent and someone who’s open to communication

•	⁠Enjoys food trips, good coffee-matcha dates and traveling especially!

I've been on an interesting coffee journey for few years as i stayed in multiple locations and trying local coffee makers.

However, last 6 months my pantry had only two brands Cothas Coffee and High Altitude coffee.

My daily driver has been Cothas filter coffee, usually with about 15% chicory. It’s a classic, and I love it. for coffee any time of the day cothas is good but for pre-workout i felt the jolt isn't sufficient.

One of my friends who is a mountaneer recommended this, I started using as my morning coffee as pre-workout dose for my runs. I tried a tube from **High Altitude Coffee**. The difference in the *type* of energy I get is wild.

The Cothas gives me a quick ""wake-up"" hit, but the High Altitude provides this incredibly smooth, sustained energy. It's not jittery at all, just a clear-headed focus that genuinely lasts for more time than regular black coffee.   
This high-altitude coffee is like paste in a tube. Here is where i bought this. it is available on Amazon too

I recently moved almost €210.000 into my account from my investments in preparation for a house downpayment. I was worried some alarm bells would go off...none did. Nothing. It's business as normal. I stuck it all into a combination of instant access savings and flexible savings account for now (short term, I am likely going to be spending most of it in a month or so). My paycheque also arrived the same day, my normal income sorter activated and moved some money into various pockets, and now...it's business as normal. 

They just didn't seem to care.

I think the reason is that I have shown myself to be a normal person. I buy coffee, and groceries, and pay rent, and pay my water bill and my mobile and my electricity, I buy some clothes, and go out to a restaurant from time to time.

So if you are interested follow along these optimised wonders it food.

Make this creamy hung curd preparation.

1. Take good Indian curd,(not amul nasty).
*Cup wala is fine, hang it to drain the water.
(Make sure you keep it inside fridge overnight to cool)
I have bought a dahi filter for this purpose.
2. Add Skimmed milk powder as per creaminess requirement in a cup of water. Add vanilla extract.
3. Mix the curd and the milk and hang it again to set.

You will be amazed as the quality of yogurt exceeds anything you tasted before.
Even Greek Yogurt is nothing compared to this texture.

Now the fun part, before the hanging for the second time. You can add vanilla, coffee or any other flavouring of your choice.
I like sugar free orange , salted kala khatta, cheesecake flavouring.
The result will be a solid block like a pudding.
For toppings use baked oats ,cocao, nuts , seeds..


The next item is my chicken breast waffles.
Pound chicken breast into keema or just buy keema, you can add your favourite spices like oregano,  chilli powder. Then spread this paste into a waffle maker and press hard. Enjoy delicious grilled chicken waffle ( chicken and waffles. If your chicken sticks ( probably you haven't pressed hard or opened early ), you could always add a little bit of oil...

Now the best flavouring for me if actually, sesame seeds ground into fine powder along with soya sauce with spring onions as a side ( pls use dipping soya sauce)
(Not dark soya sauce)
search for naturally brewed kikoman soya sauce . 
But this flavour is not cheaper.
If I am short on money I would use simple use salt and pepper with little bit butter.",1,1770022020.0,Fitness_India,0,1.0,False

It hasn't been easy, and there were plenty of days where I thought the it was too complex.

I’m trying to identify a PC game I played as a kid (roughly 12–15 years ago). I’ve been searching for a long time and haven’t found it yet, so I’m hoping someone here might recognize it.

Platform: Windows PC (installed game, not browser / Flash)
Timeframe: Likely mid-2000s to early 2010s
View: 2D, flat view
Genre: Board-game-like / experimental / indie

Gameplay:

- The game looked like a large chessboard / grid of square cells
- You controlled a single pawn
- You would roll a dice, and the pawn would move automatically that many tiles
- No WASD or manual movement
- No stats, no upgrades, no menus — extremely minimal UI
- Goal was simply to progress from the bottom of the board to the top

Pawn / character:

- Human-shaped pawn
- Completely white, faceless (no eyes, mouth, ears)
- Wearing a black formal suit (possibly with a tie)
- Very minimal design, almost mannequin-like
- Pawn stood on a circular base

Tone / visuals:

- Very minimalist, mostly white / neutral colors
- Not cartoonish, not colorful
- Felt cold, calm, and chilling
- Not intended to be funny or exciting
- More existential / soulless than playful

Events:

- When landing on tiles, images and text would appear
- Events were mundane / bureaucratic / office-like
   - e.g. broken elevator, spilled coffee, workplace issues
- Some events felt neutral, others slightly negative
- The vibe was realistic rather than humorous

Other notes:

- No character stats at all
- No life-sim complexity
- Possibly came from a game compilation or was already on the PC
- Felt like an indie or experimental game rather than a commercial release

I know this is very specific, and it might be obscure or even partially lost, but if this rings a bell for anyone, I’d really appreciate any leads — even vague ones.
