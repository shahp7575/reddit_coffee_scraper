These are the foundations I desire for the future traditional relationship and eventually marriage I am seeking. I don't want to waste anyone's time, if you don't desire these qualities in the future relationship you are seeking, I wish you the absolute best as I am not for you in that case.

If these qualities do align with you, fantastic!

I am a 5'10 blonde hair and brown eyed slim fit guy, who prides himself on a job well done, my leadership in helping others seek out their full potential and my faith in God. 

My deepest desire is to provide a lifestyle for my future spouse that she may choose to either have business outside the home or feel completely free to be a SAHW. I would love to have a few kids someday and then see if we want more afterwards. 

If you are seeking a man who is driven, passionate, hard working and faith based in Christianity. Let me know. I want things to develop naturally and at the pace best suited for our needs.

I've started going to a physical therapist (25F (not sure her exact age)) on and off for maybe 6 months to a year. (We both are heterosexual binary, btw.) As we've gotten to chat during appointments, I've found we seem to get along really well and connect on an emotional and moral level, as well as share our sense of humor and some interests. She does martial arts in her free time and has invited me to join the gym she goes to 2 times now. I've always replied that I'm too broke currently (the truth). She is not married but I don't know if she is seeing someone or interested in someone at this point.

I feel there could be something here eventually, but I would rather get to know her as a friend, and then find out if she even is available or open to something before asking her on a date. My thought is, this way there are no expectations and much less chance of one of us getting hurt and less chance of needing to change therapists haha.

Problem is, I don't really have any groups or communities I could invited her to as a friend, and I don't really feel comfortable in group setting anyway (not really a good way to get to know someone, frankly, at least in my experience).

My brother says I need to just be up front and ask her on a date because this is what dates are for.

What would you do?

I had asked a woman to coffee a few years back not knowing it was considered a date, so it seems any one-on-one between genders is a date. This honestly has been a big source of frustration for me, considering I'm not really a group type of person and feel we should be friends for a while to build trust and feel out the relationship before we start even dating.

1lexmmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/manufacturing/comments/1lexmmq/case_erector_and_bag_liner_recommendations/,Case erector and bag liner recommendations,"First off, this isn't an advertisement. I don't have anything to gain from the companies mentioned.

After dealing with our crappy Lantech machine and a Marque before that, we looked at Fallas Automation in Waco, Texas. The machines are built like a brick shithouse. Heavy bent stainless steel plates are used for the structure. It can be easily washed down. They were forced to build their own case erectors because off the shelf models wouldn't pass the stringent requirements of their clients. For instance, Starbucks requires the case erector and case packer run for two hours without faulting. They were packing those mylar coffee bags. Fallas said they couldn't reuse the bags because of wrinkles due to packing, so Starbucks sent a tractor trailer load of coffee bags worth 3 million dollars for the FAT and didn't want them back. Fallas gave us a bunch of bags when we visited. They also donated a lot to the local schools. 

We have a big heavy wall box that isn't easy to erect, and case erectors have been a struggle. That is the only box we run, and go through about a million a year. Dealing with a case erector that can't handle variance is a pain and results in wasted labor and scrap. 

The standard Fallas machine was too small for our box, so they quoted a custom machine for 125K. We were sick of crap quality and agreed to move forward. Unfortunately, Fallas was so busy that they required 5 machines to be purchased to justify a custom build. Despite having a great product, it was a bit shitty to quote us and then add a minimum quantity.

We bought a Combi instead. I wasn't involved in specifying that purchase, and they bought a standard model that barely fits our box instead of the heavy-duty XL model that's better suited for our box. We have run 7 million boxes through it and mostly runs fine. We had to add some modifications like guides for flaps that splay out and few other things that weren't well designed. Sometimes, we go through pallets of boxes that won't pick and just fall down. 98% don't do this but when it happens, it's a pain. The suction cups are right on the edge of picking our box, so if they're a little curved or maybe too porous, it won't pick right. It's a bit late, but I asked Combi to quote us custom tooling with more suction cups. Also, since the machine is one size fits all, the current adjustable tooling gets loose ovrr time and has to be tightened. I think smaller boxes would have fewer issues. 

If anyone has case erector recommendations for a big, tough box, I'd love to hear them. Our machine is reaching 8 years soon and a new one may be in the future. 

Also, we really need to find a good bag liner machine. We are currently using an OKI SL2200, and it's not great. The build quality, parts ordering, and design are substandard. We've had to repair the welds on the tooling ourselves because OKI tig welds the stainless square tubing with no filler metal. It cracks, we ordered new tooling, and it would crack again. The sprocket for the belt drive wore completely out. It's a light duty, poor quality, metric sprocket with a chain that's inferior to a bike chain. In a pinch, I machined inch standard hubs with quality sprockets and chain.

The parts manual sometimes doesn't match what we have so I send pictures circling the part in red and still get the wrong part. You can order from the part numbers in the manual diagrams, but they quote the parts with different numbers. Our parts buyers put the part in inventory using the quoted part number so if a technician cannot find the part using the manual's number. 

There are also strange things that occasionally happen like releasing a staged case when a case is in the work position despite the sensors working fine. The drive belts will stop the box short in the work position instead of hitting the stop and then the tooling crashes into the box. There are other controls issues as well. The OKI engineers have solved exactly zero controls issues. We have managed to also run 7 million cycles on this machine, but it hasn't been fun.

Any experiences and recommendations are appreciated. Price isn't a problem. We are willing to pay for premium equipment. Over the course of millions of boxes, cheap equipment gets expensive.",1,1750294268.0,manufacturing,0,1.0,False

They blinked with indifference,
out of cruelty
or because they never learned to care.

I waited for meaning to answer back.
But the night just stretched,
wide and patient,
like it had already forgotten me.

The lines beneath my eyes grow deeper.
The stars stay the same.
I feel every tick of the old clock,
like the pulse of a heart monitor.
Death remains distant,
but grows bolder with each visit.

My reflection becomes someone
I only partly remember.
The other part is
gone,
or never known.

I remember when the world felt distant.
I was small and needed mother's protection.
Things will just fall into place for me naturally, I thought.
Now I know it was never mine to hold on to.

Sometimes I think I'm the only one
who sees how fragile it all is.
Just a whisper makes them recoil.
That uncertainty,
pounding like a storm
in the chest of mankind.

To see is to invite torment.
To feel is to fracture.
Must I be the one who carries this?

I remember one more time.
The sunlight on the floor,
the smell of coffee,
and the soft sound of her breathing gently beside me.

If I vanish tomorrow,
will I still have today?

His badge read K. Wendell, Data Operations Associate III, though no one called him that. Most people didn‚Äôt call him anything.

His job, as explained during orientation, was to process intake forms from the ED: handwritten scrawls by nurses with wrist pain and poor penmanship, forms documenting coughs, amputations, unexplained twitches, full-body hives, occasional goat-related injuries.

He would transcribe them into the System, hit SUBMIT, and the machine, the great electronic brain in the ceiling, would route them to Billing, Triage, Pharmacy, Risk Management, Legal, ‚Äúor wherever they need to go,‚Äù said the training tape narrator.

For twenty years, he clicked SUBMIT. With reverence. With speed. With minor carpal tunnel flare-ups mitigated by two ibuprofen and a wrist brace he stole from Orthopedics.

Then, one late evening (census low, only two stabbings and one man trying to claim he was pregnant), he noticed something. The confirmation screen‚Äîthe little window that popped up and chirped ‚ÄúRecord accepted!‚Äù‚Äîwas gone. In its place: nothing. No error. No approval. Just a void. Like God had gone on PTO.

He called IT. IT transferred him to Informatics. Informatics sent him a Word doc with ‚ÄúWorkflow Redesign‚Äù in the header and a bullet point that read:

Legacy data pipeline deprecated. No current endpoint required for submission task. Please continue to document as usual.

He stared at that line for the better part of his shift. Then he minimized it, opened a new record, typed:

‚ÄúPatient arrived with shoe embedded in left cheek. No signs of infection. Antibiotics deferred due to insurance lapse.‚Äù[SUBMIT]

Again.

And again.

They still paid him every other Friday‚ÄîDirect Deposit. He still got the all-staff birthday email (Subject: üéâ You‚Äôre Part of the Team!). He once asked HR if his job still mattered. They said, ‚ÄúOf course! Without documentation, how would we ever prove the care happened?‚Äù

He nodded like a man listening to the ocean through a conch shell. Then went back to work.

They eventually moved his desk into a supply closet when the office needed space for new AI Compliance Monitors. He didn‚Äôt complain. The Submit button followed him wherever he logged in.

‚ÄúHey Folks,
Unfortunately we can't make it to @grpridefestival this year since we're still recovering from the unexpected 6+ month hiatus on our transition/ opening.

We could use your support, over the past few years we haven't had much luck with the news/ press releases despite having a solid mission statement and great material to use

Few examples. We're the only coffee shop or one of the few shops to: be a public warming and cooling shelter for Kent county, paying a living wage, having a public library and pantry, being Grand Rapids only queer dry bar. Free social events aimed at bringing folks together. We could go on but honestly there's a lot that we do.

We're slept on, like pretty hard by local media.

It is what it is & we've come to accept it. Since then we've focused on word of mouth with trying to still do press releases on the off chance someone does pick it up.

We could use your support, here's how

Please share this post spread the word, if we're not getting a ton of support media wise then word of mouth is the next best thing.

Pride weekend we'll have normal hours & are doing $1 off all weekend on drinks/ Togo stuff.

We're also doing pride nights Saturday & Sunday with our full dry bar.

Thanks again everyone 

Small note 
Thank you for believing in us and supporting this shop to grow into something I never thought possible.

We survived covid, a destination location with little to no foot traffic, half a year hiatus, many different trials and to tribulations while still trying to do good.

The amount of times I was told we wouldn't be in business long if we paid a living wage, if we went from queer friendly to outwardly queer it would hurt our potential demographic/ sales.

How the kindness cup and community pantry would scare guest with the ""type "" that it would bring in.(Also to the jackass, go fuck yourself for saying helping folks is bad for business.)

The amount of bullshit we've overcome as a shop is thanks to this community for believing in what we're trying to do.

Thank you for supporting what we've been doing for 5 years, we'll continue doing what we can to push for the change we want to see. 

These colors don't run

I was dx'd with GERD 30 years ago. Got put on Nexium, and that pretty much kept things under control for years. But over the last couple of years, I started having these weird symptoms. Tightening in my throat, wheezing, shortness of breath, constant coughing, and just feeling out of breath. No heartburn. Nothing obvious. Just this constant tickle in my throat and tightening in my chest that no one could explain.

My primary didn‚Äôt have answers. He went straight to asthma. Which i totally fight him on. none of the inhalers he gave me work. None of the steroids he gave me worked. It was always so disappointing, Neither did my ENT. I was told maybe allergies, maybe stress. Nope.

- Quit coffee completely
- Started taking Gaviscon Advance (two tablespoons before meals)
- Ate only bland food for first five days. No acid, no spice, nothing fried or fatty. ChickenC rice and Water. Hardboiled eggs etc.
- Sipped hot water throughout the day (especially when I feel that tickle)
- Elevated my head when sleeping
- Cut down on talking or throat clearing

For the first time in years, I feel like I‚Äôm actually improving. My breathing this week has been insanely better. The tightness and tickle in my throat is finally starting to calm down. The constant coughing has eased up. Especially when I go to eat. This always seems exacerbated by eating meals. 

Still got a ways to go, but wanted to share what‚Äôs been working in case it helps someone else out there who‚Äôs just as frustrated as I was.",1,1750293852.0,SilentReflux,0,1.0,False
1lexhfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkslope/comments/1lexhfm/need_to_vent_after_moving/,Need to vent after moving,"I moved from one studio in Gowanus to another in Park/South Slope (depending on where you think the border is) and this whole process has been a nightmare.

First off, my landlord unfortunately has a bunch of health issues that forced him to sell my building to a new owner who wanted us all out by the end of July. I found this out a week after returning from an expensive trip early May.

I ended up finding a place by knowing people and just moved in this past weekend. It was awful. I booked Dumbo Moving and I ended up deciding not to take a majority of my furniture as I didn't have room/wanted different items BUT I did have some more boxes and moving bags than I originally put in the quote. I originally put in 20 medium boxes and 6 moving bags, it was more like 25 small-mediun boxes and 12 moving bags. The only furniture I moved with me was my bed and frame, bookcase, coffee table, a floor lamp, and a microwave stand (which they broke). One of the movers said I have too much stuff and he said now he has to go up and down more. I moved from the first floor to the third floor. I do understand where he was coming from, but I was a little surprised that it was an issue he brought up with me in an aggressive manner. I tipped them 30% of the price of the move. 

However because I felt terrible I left a lot of stuff and decided on getting a TaskRabbit. The TR was actually the best part of the day LOL he was a nice guy and got a bunch of my stuff with no complaints. Honestly I wish I ended up getting a TR for the big move to begin with now. 

But I still had some stuff I couldn't fit in his cargo van, so I got an Uber XL to pick up two small boxes, three shopping bags, and my vacuum and broom. As soon as I was connected to a driver I sent a message saying that I was moving those items and he didn't have to help me at all. My old apartment building is on the right side of the street; the Uber driver parked on the left side and kept rushing my boyfriend and I as we were running across the street to put my things in the trunk. My bf took my shopping cart and rolled it to my new place while I was in the Uber. Once we got to my new place, I was again rushed to take everything out by the driver. He yelled at me for leaving the door open accidentally because I forgot to close it as I was rushing. I still gave him 5 stars and tipped 30%. 

Oh and I forgot one of my bags at my old place, but my landlord got it and gave it back to me -- totally untouched thankfully. 

My bf and I took out most of the remaining furniture because we thought bulk disposal pickup was on Mondays, but it's on Thursdays instead. My landlord took care of that though. The only things that remained were a couch and a kitchen cart. 

I was going to originally hire junk removers but then I saw they were at least $200 so I decided to come back today with my friend. I texted my landlord an hour and a half before I arrived that I was going to remove the remaining furniture. We took it out, no problem. I also brought put some random stuff out on the sidewalk that I didn't think needed to be thrown out as they were still in good condition and when I used to live in Bed Stuy and Bushwick people left stuff on the sidewalk to take all the time. I 100% admit this is on me, and I shouldn't have done it because Park Slope is different. 

Anyway my landlord told me an hour ago that he's going to get a summons because tomorrow (Juneteenth) is a holiday which means DSNY isn't gonna come until Monday and it's going to rain overnight. I ended up booking a junk removal service first thing tomorrow morning anyway. My landlord also told me that the new owner is going to gut and renovate the whole building and no one will move in after me, which is why I didnt deep clean the oven and stove before I moved out but he told me I had to in order to get my deposit back.

I know a lot of these stressors are my fault, but goddamn why does moving have to be so hard? Every time I tried to save money I end up paying way more than I anticipated. I really just want to unpack and enjoy my new place.",1,1750293844.0,parkslope,1,0.6,False

As we've gotten to chat during appointments, I've found we seem to get along really well and connect on an emotional and moral/biblical level (we're both Christians with similar perspectives), as well as share our sense of humor and some interests. She does martial arts in her free time and has invited me to join the gym she goes to 2 times now. I've always replied that I'm too broke currently (the truth). She is not married but I don't know if she is seeing someone or interested in someone at this point.

I feel there could be something here eventually, but I would rather get to know her as a friend, and then find out if she even is available or open to something before asking her on a date. My thought is, this way there are no expectations and much less chance of one of us getting hurt and less chance of needing to change therapists haha.

Problem is, I don't really have any groups or communities I could invited her to as a friend, and I don't really feel comfortable in group setting anyway (not really a good way to get to know someone, frankly, at least in my experience).

My brother says I need to just be up front and ask her on a date because this is what dates are for.

What would you do?

I had asked a woman to coffee a few years back not knowing it was considered a date, so it seems any one-on-one between genders is a date. This honestly has been a big source of frustration for me, considering I'm not really a group type of person and feel we should be friends for a while to build trust and feel out the relationship before we start even dating.

I'm sharing my observation as a slightly different trip report. Anyone who is in Japan and knows more, please chime in with your experiences and knowledge. For everyone else, I hope this is entertaining and sparks your curiosity for more.

If you want to jump ahead to the interesting parts, skip Mont-Bell and Snowpeak and go straight to ‚ÄôYamatomichi.‚Äô

Companion photos on [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/Yuc6GNm).

**Osaka: Mont-Bell**
My first stop was Osaka. I immediately recognized Mont-Bell‚Äôs massive footprint, but not in the way I thought I would. I had been toying with the idea of getting a Versatile rain jacket for a while (it is one of the lighter options out there), so I thought Mont-Bell would be a specialty shop. So when I saw a man on the subway who must've been in his 60s sporting a Mont-Bell backpack, I was a bit surprised. Mont-Bell is probably more like a Solomon in France.

*Mont-Bell Store*
The Mont-Bell store was packed. And everything they sold was Mont-Bell. In my mind I was seeing an REI store that only sold Co-op gear. The selection was interesting, they are heavy on clothing. They had various different raincoats, but none of them had pit zips. This was to become a bit of a theme‚Äîan affinity for simpler solutions that left out features that, at least on r/ultralight, are often considered must haves.

After trying on half a dozen different sun hats, we left with two pairs of sun gloves. I had expected more.

**Kyoto: Snowpeak Land Station**
In Kyoto, the first outdoor gear store I visited was the Snowpeak Land Station near the Bamboo Forest. It‚Äôs at an intersection a few minutes from the station in a single-story building with a cafe and an outdoor patio‚Äîa brand experience store.

The merchandise is in the back in an elevated area. Clothes are in the main room and gear in two side rooms. I wanted to find something, but Snowpeak is expensive and just not very light. I  think it‚Äôs a high-end glamping store.

We settled for an Americano, matcha tea, and an apple juice before moving on.

**Kyoto: Yamatomichi**
Yamatomichi is located off the beaten path in a quirky neighborhood. Like other UL stores, they are only open four days a week from Thursday through Sunday and from 12 noon through 8pm.

The store is a 10-minute walk from the station, but it was worth it. 

Staff were very knowledgeable and ultralight backpackers themselves (they immediately recognized my Pa‚Äôlante, which apparently is very popular in Japan). Their store is well-stocked with their own gear. They had several racks of Yamatomichi backpacks in various sizes and fabrics. The packs are filled and weighted so that you have an immediate feel for how they carry (they are very well made but I found the straps a bit light on padding).

Their packs are frameless and they offer various CCF pads to create some rigidity in the pack. Again, I would say tube CCF pads are probably not standard practice on r/ultralight anymore, but they appear to be in Japan.

Yamatomichi also has an array of clothing, several Alpha Direct items, and most importantly their Trail Shirts. Each shirt‚Äôs box notes the type, size, and weight in grams of each shirt. We bought four of them, bamboo shirts and the much lighter UL shirts. (Note: their up-to-date store inventory is available on their website.)

*Kamogawa River*
On the way back we walked along the Kamogawa River and then through the neighborhood. There is a little canal that runs down the center of a street. A small coffee shop, called Murmur, had a nice ledge where you could sip coffee and look out over the street and the canal.

Without the trip to Yamatomichi, I would have never gotten to see this charming neighborhood.

**Tokyo: Moonlight Gear**
In Tokio, I had hoped to visit Nicetime Mountain Gallery. They are west of Shibuya and have a revolving showcase of UL gear makers. When we arrived in Tokyo, they were showing a Korean gear maker‚Äôs products, but I missed the Thursday to Sunday window.

*Moonlight Gear Store*
Moonlight Gear is a 10-minute walk from Akihabara Station. It‚Äôs a relatively small store, but what a selection of UL gear! I have seen none like it.

When you come in, there is a wall of backpacks: HMG, ULA, MLD, Zpacks, and Pa‚Äôlante. They have every single Pa‚Äôlante pack in every size. It was fantastic to be able to compare the Pa‚Äôlante v2 to the Desert and then the 17‚Äù to the 19‚Äù. You can immediately see the size difference as apposed to having to guess it from the website. Also the difference in geometry between a MLD Hell and a Joey was easy to see, and of course you could try them on. All packs were frameless. 

Beyond packs, they had tarps, sleeping pads, quilts (mainly EE), clothes, trekking poles.

Staff, again was very knowledgeable. The person I spoke with had done the PCT in ‚Äô23. I ultimately got a crossover UL/city daypack by a gear maker located in Hokkaido called if you have.

In a conversation with Moonlight Gear‚Äôs owner, who was there for the launch of one of their own products, I explained to him how special it was to see all of these UL products in one place. I also asked if they were familiar with r/ultralight. They were not, but now they are.

**Tokyo: Art Sports ODBOX Shop**
Moonlight Gear carries multiple brands. One of the brands on their site is a Japanese brand called Trail Bum. Unfortunately, they didn‚Äôt have any of their products in store. But I saw that another store called Art Sports carried them. Art Sports is one station north of Akihabara, at Okachimachi. The store is right outside the station.

When I saw it, I was skeptical. From the outside it looks like a sports shoe store with a huge selection of shoes in the windows. But once inside, they have an incredible selection of gear. They carried the Trail Bum Big Turtle pack that I wanted to see. They also had two ponchos I was interested in (I ended up getting the Gnu S Cape, a 5-oz poncho tarp).

On the ground floor they had a massive selection of UL stoves, mats, packs, and all sorts of accessories. A selection of fixed-length trekking poles was very interesting. The upper level had clothing; for time reasons I skipped this section. This would be a great store for anyone starting out to assemble a UL kit.

If I had more time, I would have also gone to Hiker‚Äôs Depot in Mitaka. Next time.

**UL Community and Ethos**

*UL Ethos*
I was impressed by the strong UL ethos: a strong preference for frameless packs, CCF pads, tarps and the leaving out of luxuries like pit zips (I didn‚Äôt see a single rain jacket with them). The UL culture seems to be centered around little shops, blogs, and get-togethers. I read about a two-day navigation challenge event that seemed to draw a large turnout. In-person interactions seem to be an important part of shaping the culture.

*U2 - Under 2 kg (4.4 lbs)*
While researching the Trail Bum Gnu S Cape, I came across an interesting blog post. It considered different benchmarks of UL, including the standard UL (4.5 kg), SUL (3 kg), and in addition a category I had never heard of ‚ÄúU2.‚Äù U2 is under 2kg. The poncho tarp Gnu S Cape was listed as part of a 1777g U2-loadout, fully acknowledging that the legs would stick out of the small tarp (just use a waterproof sheet to cover your legs).

https://hikersdepot.jp/blogs/gear-review/gr-gnu-s-cape

*Other Observations*
I did not see very many Ultra or DCF products. There seemed to be a preference for more traditional SilPoly/SilNylon and Ultragrid/Ultraweave.

I didn‚Äôt do any price checks, but the American-made packs seemed to be expensive. One of the key benefits is to have access to Japanese products that are otherwise hard to get. Trail bump just started to take international orders. Most others don‚Äôt sell outside of Japan.

On Trail Bum‚Äôs How to choose a backpack post, I found my favorite UL quote:

>If you accumulate experience and wisdom from hikers, you can use any backpack for any purpose

1lex5xg,https://www.reddit.com/r/honeymoonplanning/comments/1lex5xg/safari_honeymoons/,Safari Honeymoons,"Okay so, disclaimer up front. I didn‚Äôt actually go on safari for my honeymoon. We had plans, big ones. Then... Covid. You know how that story goes. Borders closed, everything we booked got canceled, and instead of sleeping under the stars somewhere magical, we were in our living room eating delivery and watching Tiger King like everyone else.

Anyway, fast forward. I just got back from two weeks in Botswana visiting a bunch of Wilderness safari camps. I was technically there for work, but honestly, the entire time I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how freaking perfect this would‚Äôve been for a honeymoon. Elephants at sunset, Champagne on a boat, plunge pools overlooking rivers full of hippos. It‚Äôs ridiculous in the best possible way.

If you‚Äôre here deciding between another resort in the Maldives or a cute little Amalfi coast itinerary that‚Äôs been on 500 travel blogs already, I‚Äôm just gonna throw this into the ring. Safari honeymoon. Specifically in Botswana. And even more specifically, these four Wilderness camps: King‚Äôs Pool, DumaTau, Vumbura Plains, and Mombo.

Let me just start with King‚Äôs Pool because wow. This one felt like pure honeymoon energy but with a little danger in the background. Not like unsafe danger, just that ‚Äúyou‚Äôre in the middle of the wild and anything could walk past your deck at any moment‚Äù kind of thing. Which, trust me, is a vibe. You‚Äôve got this huge bed with netting, everything opens up to the outside, and the waterhole right in front of camp attracts elephants, wild dogs, you name it. One night I watched a herd of elephants walk past while I was brushing my teeth. The barge cruise they do at sunset? Unreal. It‚Äôs you, your partner, a guide who quietly brings you drinks, and a floating lounge setup in the middle of the channel. Total silence except for birds and the occasional snort from a hippo. 10 out of 10 honeymoon material.

Then there‚Äôs DumaTau. This one felt the most romantic to me, like soft luxury. You know what I mean? It‚Äôs not trying too hard, it just knows it‚Äôs amazing. Rooms are huge and dreamy and have these big outdoor spaces with views over the river. While I was eating lunch one day, elephants walked under the deck. Like not in the distance, like directly underneath. If you‚Äôre into candlelit dinners and surprise bubble baths and feeling like the only people in the world, this is your spot. Also, no wifi in camp which weirdly made it feel even more intimate. You actually talk to each other, or just listen to the animals, or sit quietly and feel like the world isn‚Äôt yelling at you for a minute.

Vumbura Plains is where I‚Äôd send couples who like things a little more modern. Still romantic, still deeply in the bush, but with this really sleek design. Think big glass doors, beautiful lines, art on the walls, designer furniture but nothing that feels out of place. You still get that safari magic but it‚Äôs curated in this way that feels really cool. I had a moment here at golden hour where we were tracking a lioness and she just appeared out of the grass and walked straight toward our vehicle. I cried a little. It was this weirdly emotional thing I wasn‚Äôt expecting. The light, the silence, the wildness of it all. And knowing you get to go back to a private plunge pool after that? Yeah. It sticks with you.

And then Mombo. This place is not playing around. If you‚Äôre looking to go all out, this is it. The rooms are insane. Like a full-on villa with indoor and outdoor everything, a private deck that overlooks the Okavango floodplain, and more game than I‚Äôve ever seen anywhere. We saw leopards 20 minutes into our first drive. The staff is next level. They remembered my name, my coffee order, even that it was my birthday and surprised me with a cake and music and a handwritten card. Can you imagine being on your honeymoon and coming back to your room and they‚Äôve filled the bathtub with flowers and champagne is waiting and there are candles everywhere? Come on. That‚Äôs peak honeymoon stuff.

And here‚Äôs the thing. Everyone talks about safari like it‚Äôs this big, expensive bucket list trip. And yeah, it‚Äôs not budget. But when you break it down, you‚Äôre getting everything included. Meals, drinks, transfers, game drives, laundry, service that puts five-star hotels to shame. Plus the fact that you‚Äôre staying in places that support conservation, employ local communities, and are doing meaningful work behind the scenes. It‚Äôs travel that feels good and also feels... just really freaking good.

If you‚Äôre planning your honeymoon and you want something different, something that‚Äôll make your friends go ‚Äúwait... you honeymooned where??‚Äù consider Botswana. Consider these camps. I can‚Äôt unsee how perfect it all was. And if you have questions or want real recommendations, happy to share.

Drink decaf all day!,"I worked at a large call center for a medical imaging company. There were over 120 people that worked in that area with a communal kitchen in the center of the ""racetrack"". Three large carafes of coffee one of which was decaf, the other two being regular blend. The rule, as with most places with this type of setup, is take the last cup, make the next pot. 

One Friday morning I started on the 5AM shift, got in to work, made all three carafes of coffee then went to my desk while they brewed. Phone rings and I am busy for about 1/2 hour. Go to get a cup of coffee and both regular carafes are empty, decaf is about 1/2. Brew another round of carafes and go back to my desk, get another phone call, get back to the kitchen after 20 minutes and again the carafes are empty.

Well, fuck this and fuck them, I brew one carafe of regular coffee and the other two are decaf. Wait until it's finished brewing, make myself two cups of coffee and dump it out. Brew a third pot of decaf. For the rest of the morning I was running into the kitchen and keeping those carafes full,,, of decaf.

My boss had arrived and was having a coffee and was commenting on he just couldn't  seem to wake up this morning. Suggested we go across the street to the Tim Horton's and get a coffee there as the walk would do him good. Bought him a coffee and on the way back told him what I had been doing. He cursed me then laughed. It was an interesting day watching the racetrack yawn and complain about being sleepy, and drinking a lot more coffee than they normally did and still couldn't get fired up.",33,1750292593.0,pettyrevenge,3,0.95,False

Background:
My partner and I live together with our children from previous relationships both with 50/50 custody. We have lived together for 1.5 years.
My partner‚Äôs ex is shamelessly assertive (I am very assertive as well). In the past, she has said things like she is his family and I am not, and screamed publicly twice at exchanges where I was present prior to us living together. She emotionally abused him, taught their child to abuse him, and he was a husk when we met.

Fast forward to Christmas, where she wrote us each a letter, with mine saying she wanted to have coffee and get to know each other, and with his saying that she wanted us all to hang out as a happy family with our children. My partner became incensed at this suggestion and immediately wrote her an email saying that this would never happen and that it would be confusing for their son, who wants them to get back together. She has caused problems for us in the past, priming their son to be angry and upset our entire summer vacation. A typical emotionally immature parent and, IMO as a mental health clinician, a narcissist.

I said to my partner I might be open to getting coffee with her when I received her xmas letter, and he said that if I befriended her or had coffee with her, he would break up with me.

Today I had moved some clients around to be able to attend his son‚Äôs KG talent show. He was in a bad mood when he picked me up, saying he was hungry. Going in, and knowing what she is like, I suggested making a strategy if she were to try to sit with us, which was essentially saying no thank you and sitting somewhere else.

He agreed, but I think he was just trying to get me to stop talking, and we went in. Lo and behold, that is exactly what happened. I said ‚Äúno thank you,‚Äù and that I wanted to respect his boundary of not having a friendship with her, because I knew he wouldn‚Äôt say anything. She started with a tone at me, claiming it was just for their son (I am also separated and IMO, you do not need to sit with your ex in order for your child to feel supported). He told me, in front of her, that I was ‚Äúmaking a problem,‚Äù and sat down, forcing me to sit in between them. He did not get up when someone announced there were more chairs available.

Upon leaving, he asked me in the car if aomething was wrong, so I reminded him that he told me he would end our relationship if I became friends with her, and he said I just shouldn‚Äôt have said anything at all. He then told me to get out of his car once we were outside of my work.

He has a history of lying - it has been 6 mos since his last lie that I know of, but last year was a nightmare with many lies occurring. He is also 9 years younger than me.

AITH for feeling so upset that he threw me under the bus like that in front of her and disrespected the boundary/strategy that we discussed? I am feeling like I want to end the relationship. I am also 3 weeks out from a miscarriage. TIA.",12,1750292551.0,AITH,12,0.83,False

1lewvzb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lewvzb,I‚Äôve been putting this off way too long‚Ä¶,"I moved into my new apartment with a roommate three months ago to save money, and to help him out. It was basically a win-win. He wouldn‚Äôt have to drive so far to get to town (he‚Äôs about 40 miles away from the nearest city), and my rent would be split in half (I actually lived IN the middle of the city, so rent is crazy there). The only downside is that now I have to drive 15-20 minutes to get into town instead of two seconds. üòÖ 

Anyway, I know he posted in here about a month ago, so if anything looks familiar, that‚Äôs why. I‚Äôve been putting it off because I keep thinking ‚ÄúI need to put just ONE more thing up before posting. But f*ck it, I‚Äôm ready.

First photo is my bedroom/office. I work remotely, so I use that standing desk and laptop with two monitors for work. Queen size bed. The music notes were given to me as a gift, as I‚Äôm a semi-professional singer and music lover. The oil painting is of John Coltrane, my favorite saxophonist.

Second picture is the bathroom. Pretty self-explanatory. Sticking with the blue and white theme of the bedroom.

Third we‚Äôve got my walk-in closet. It‚Äôs a closet. And you walk in it.

Fourth is my living room. I live in it. And it‚Äôs a room. The brown couch/loveseat is actually a recliner, which is cool. It reclines on both sides. I‚Äôve been known to fall asleep on it many times. On either side of it are my roommate‚Äôs recliners. By the window is a lamp, with my straw hat hanging on it. It‚Äôs a nice hanger. On the end table between the blue chair and the couch (it‚Äôs kind of hard to see) is my roommate‚Äôs turntable. We share it. I used to have my own, but it sucked, so I just trashed it and use his instead. Then there‚Äôs the coffee table in front of the couch, which we don‚Äôt really use often. It‚Äôs just for junk like pens and junk mail and stuff. It‚Äôs his‚Ä¶I would never have gotten one. It‚Äôs kind of pointless IMO. üòÇ And the giant picture above the couch is just a silhouette of a couple dancing and some music notes. My mom got me that because I love dancing.

Now we‚Äôve got my kitchen, probably my favorite room. I‚Äôm big into home cooking. I love cooking fresh homemade food and not wasting my money on eating out with mediocre service and expensive food. So I use it a lot. That shelf above the sink has all my oils, vinegars, and grains like rice, couscous, etc. The island functions as both a cooking area for my cutting board and an actual dining counter. Then on the top shelf above the sink is a picture of my roommate‚Äôs cock‚Äîumm, I mean rooster. üêì 

The laundry room. It‚Äôs a room where I do laundry. It also has my crappy Roomba in there.

Next is the dining area, openly connected to the living room and kitchen. I really like this room. The table, chairs, and US map are my roommate‚Äôs. The photo of the bridge is mine. The gray counter is what we decided to make our ‚Äúcoffee/kava area.‚Äù We‚Äôve got both of our coffee machines, his pour-over, and my AeroPress scattered all over that counter. We‚Äôve also got my kava bottle, AlluBall, and kava strainer bag there. If you don‚Äôt know what kava is, look it up. It‚Äôs awesome.

Last but not least is my balcony. Two relaxing chairs and a bird feeder that needs to be filled. I get a lot of purple finches there. Oh, and also the outdoor storage closet! This was one of the things that made me settle on this apartment when we were searching. I wanted somewhere to put my toolbox and small furniture I wasn‚Äôt willing to get rid of‚Ä¶and Christmas decorations! So there‚Äôs that.

I‚Äôll leave his bedroom and bathroom alone because, you know, privacy and stuff. But I hope you enjoyed your tour of my male living space. Do y‚Äôall have any tips, whether it‚Äôs about decor or something more utilitarian? There is one thing I‚Äôm considering changing, if y‚Äôall have any tips:

It you noticed that black thing on top of the dryer in the laundry room, that‚Äôs a coat/hat hanger. It has to be nailed to the wall, which I tried doing, but I can‚Äôt seem to space out the nails the right distance to fit in the holes. So I kind of just gave up on that and put all my hats and coats in my closet. But if y‚Äôall have any tips on spacing out nails, I MIGHT try again. Or maybe I‚Äôll just sell the thing and not worry about it.",3,1750292100.0,malelivingspace,1,1.0,False

(His ex-wife wanted the divorce to pursue another relationship). Husband and I are both teachers. His girls were 3 and 5 when I met him, and we married when the girls were 11 and 13 (they were my junior bridesmaids) and had a couple boys 2 and 4 years after we were married.

We tried to treat the kids equally but of course the boys were younger and needed more attention and direction and my younger daughter did express some hard feelings that the boys got to grow up with both parents in a calmer, kid-focused environment. 

My daughters‚Äô mother hated my husband and I for whatever reason, and bad-mouthed us a lot. My daughters were sometimes disrespectful to me (examples: snide comments about my butt looking big, taking my clothes without asking and leaving them at their mother‚Äôs house). I never felt fully accepted by them but I lived with that as I figured their mom was a huge influence in that department. It was that way for many years.

About 12 years ago I was supposed to meet the daughters at an indoor water park where they were staying with their spouses for the night. They had picked up their little brothers (grade school age) and made arrangements for me to meet them there at 1 pm when I got off work. They called to ask me to stop off and get some baby aspirin for one of the grandkids and said they knew I would be 30 min late but to text when I got there and they would come out and give me my ticket to get in. I texted and texted but they never responded and I ended up sitting there for 3.5 hours freaking out wondering if they were watching my boys and if the one was having any difficulty with his asthma breathing in the humid air. They came out at 5 when they knew my husband was showing up. They did not apologize and were offended that I was annoyed.

About 10 years ago, older daughter and her husband (she moved across the country to marry him) came for a visit and told us that they were going to get divorced. It was older daughter‚Äôs request.  We were close to her husband by that time (my husband was the only dad he had ever known) and we told them that we were going to maintain connection to both of them for the sake of their daughter. They both felt that was reasonable. Our granddaughter goes back and forth between both houses 1 week at a time.

About 8 years ago, older daughter and younger daughter descended on the house on a Thurs evening unexpectedly due to a funeral on their mother‚Äôs side of the family. I had to scramble to get groceries and make up beds for everyone to sleep. It was normal for me to spend all my time cooking and cleaning up the kitchen, washing towels, cleaning up behind people, etc. when everyone came to visit. The girls and their kids would leave their belongings in every room of the house. I rarely got to spend time with the kids or grandkids because there was so much to do. 

The girls did not monitor their kids so they would do things like cut cords on earphones, draw on the wall, spill things in rooms where they shouldn‚Äôt be with food, and I seemed to always be one step behind.  That visit, they took off in my van each day without asking, broke into my bathroom (attached to our bedroom which was locked while I was asleep ) and woke up to 4 people in my bathroom, using my cosmetics, blasting music, dirty towels and clothes on the floor, and a toddler with an opened bottle of my nail polish. (There are 2 other full bathrooms in the house and no need to use mine.)

I had a serious conversation with my husband that night and the following day and told him I was done being a doormat. A couple days later he talked to them and told them that they would not be welcome in our home anymore unless they started to respect us and our home, and clean up after themselves.  Both daughters were mad and felt that he was being unfair, but the younger daughter eventually apologized and took responsibility for her part. She made a 360 degree change and actually scolded my husband for not sticking up for me prior to that. She and I had a lot of good conversations after that and she started calling me Mom and we are very close now. We talk all the time on the phone, travel together, and when she and her husband and their two boys come to visit we always have a lot of fun and everyone helps with cooking  and cleaning up.

The older daughter was offended that my husband corrected her and has never stayed at our home again. She cut off contact and moved and did not share her address.

About 6 years ago, my former son-in-law got married and invited us to his wedding. Our summer trip was out west anyway, so we decided to go to the city where they were getting married and attend their wedding and take our granddaughter to stay at the hotel with us for a couple days so the honeymooners could have the night to themselves. We did not stop off to visit our older daughter as it was 6 hours further and we had to get back home to return to work. Also she was still not speaking to us.

My grand daughter‚Äôs step-mom is a super nice lady who reminds me of me‚Ä¶ she is very kid-focused, wants to do a good job of being a step-mom, is reading books and has asked me how to handle certain situations as a step-mom, takes my granddaughter to mother-daughter church events, etc. And she likes me! I feel needed and accepted by her, and I get to be part of my granddaughter‚Äôs life!

Honestly, it weren‚Äôt for my grand-daughter‚Äôs dad and step-mom, my husband and I would probably not have any contact with our granddaughter. They plan time for us to FaceTime on holidays and birthdays, they send school pictures, and send pictures of her in her activities (soccer, choir, etc.). My granddaughter‚Äôs father has flown her to us 3 different times in the past 6 years to allow us to spend their week with her. (We provide the airline tickets.) And then we bring her back to them when the week is over.

Granddaughter now has two little sibs and I send Christmas and birthday gifts to all 3 kids. Besides my husband and I, the 2 younger kids only have one other grandparent type person in their lives, so they call us the same names as our granddaughter does and she seems to know that this is just easier for the little ones as they don‚Äôt understand divorce and step and that sort of thing.

We have tried to maintain good communication with the older daughter. About 5 years ago we invited her and her boyfriend to join us on vacation camping. During that trip she borrowed one son‚Äôs phone and he found it outside of its waterproof bag in the river. When asked about it, she lied and then blamed him for having it near the river in the first place. This was a phone that he saved up for doing odd jobs and bought used. There was never an apology. I don‚Äôt believe she has ever apologized for anything in the time I have known her.

Our older son graduated high school 5 years ago and our younger son graduated 3 years ago. Older daughter was invited to both parties but did not even send a text of congratulations. However, when her brother at her mother‚Äôs house graduated 2 years ago, she drove across the country to attend his party.

One year ago, we emailed and invited older daughter to come on a cruise with us. She did not respond, but younger daughter said she received the email. Our other three kids and 2 grandsons came and our granddaughter‚Äôs father again flew her out to us so she could join us. When we drove her back, older daughter chose to meet us in a parking lot to get her back from us. She did not suggest to meet at a place to get coffee, and she did not invite us to her place. After 15 min she seemed eager to leave. 

The first words out of older daughter‚Äôs  mouth when my granddaughter excitedly told her that I had let her try on my wedding dress was that she saw the picture on Facebook and it looked way better on granddaughter than it ever looked on me.  (Shots fired!) We had planned to stay another night so we could hang out with older daughter that next day, but it was clear she had no interest in that, so when we got back to the hotel that night we cancelled our room for the following night and left the next morning for the two day trip home.

One year ago, older daughter got married and did not invite us or our boys (her brothers) to her wedding.

This past week we were traveling with the three kids and 2 grandboys and one night at dinner I said how it would be great if someday older daughter and her new husband and new step-daughter and our granddaughter could join us on one of these trips in the future. Youngest son expressed that he was just fine if she stayed away, and younger daughter was offended on behalf of older daughter.  

We had a conversation later in which I asked if she knows why older daughter hates us so much and younger daughter says she thinks it‚Äôs because we are close to older daughter‚Äôs ex-spouse. 

She said ‚ÄúIf I ever got divorced and you kept up a relationship with my ex, I would be pissed‚Äù.  This is not the first time she has expressed that it is ridiculous that we have a relationship with ‚Äúthem‚Äù.  

I‚Äôve never been divorced but my husband has and he says it would have been so much better for the girls if he and his ex had been cordial. He doesn‚Äôt see anything wrong with having a good relationship with our granddaughters dad and step-mom and siblings at that house.  They live across the country so it‚Äôs not like we see them all the time. 

So are we the AHs?

Our community is about to take over the HOA from the builder, and I‚Äôm seriously considering running for a seat on the board. However, I have some concerns.

While I‚Äôm motivated to step up‚Äîespecially since some of the people considering running have unrealistic expectations about what we can or should do after the transition‚ÄîI‚Äôm also worried about the potential stress. I suspect I‚Äôll be stopped during my walks around the neighborhood by residents wanting to complain about everything, even the most trivial issues.

Here are just a few of the issues we‚Äôre already facing:

\*\*1. Parking:\*\*

Each townhouse has a garage that fits between two to four cars, depending on the model. Mid-size homes have tandem setups (one car inside, one on the driveway), while larger homes can accommodate two cars inside and two on the driveway. In addition, we have around 100 guest parking spots scattered throughout the community, though they are often empty 80% of the time.

Despite this, residents frequently complain about others using guest spaces for their own cars. Those receiving warnings argue that it's silly for the spaces to remain empty when they could be used. Interestingly, none of the complainers have said their guests had to leave due to lack of parking‚Äîonly that they had to park a few homes away. It seems the underlying issue is more about ""rules are rules"" than any actual parking shortage.

\*\*2. Landscaping:\*\*

Some residents are unhappy with the appearance of the lawns, particularly brown patches. There‚Äôs a push for more manicured landscaping, without an understanding that this would likely increase HOA dues. They seem to think better grass comes from an imaginary budget rather than from actual funds.

\*\*3. Light Fixtures:\*\*

There are complaints about the outdoor lights on each home not being at uniform heights. However, the homes are built on a slope, and the alignment simply can‚Äôt be perfect. This seems like a minor aesthetic issue being blown out of proportion.

\*\*4. Clubhouse Coffee Shop Idea:\*\*

One resident proposed turning part of the clubhouse into a coffee shop so neighbors can have a place to buy coffee. Aside from the logistical nightmare, this would violate our bylaws and likely void our insurance. It‚Äôs a nonstarter, yet it was presented as a serious idea.

So my question is:

Am I setting myself up for endless headaches by running for the board?

And if I do move forward, how do I best approach these types of issues without being overwhelmed by every minor complaint? I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who‚Äôs been through this or has insight to share.

I cut gluten on Sunday, and my symptoms since then have been so much better in a night and day kind of ""oh it's been so long since my stomach WASNT a low lying thought constantly burning in my body/mind"" tragic way. So on the one hand after years of stomach issues and months of colonoscopy endoscopy bloodwork more bloodwork back and forths w drs, it is a huge relief to have found SOMETHING (anything) and it's a thing I can do something about, and it's immediately helping. And I can have coffee again! (I had cut out like a dozen things like alcohol and coffee and beans and such bc it seemed like things were worse with them). 

and

I have spent the last few days vacillating between yay coffee and literally crying over the stupidest foods. I don't even like pretzels that much and I just burst into tears because I remembered pretzels. Then I calmed down and ten minutes later: english muffins. Crying again lmfao. The other day it was christmas cinnamon rolls and birthday cake and the bread I grew up making with my mom and jets pizza. We just had dinner and we got gf buns to have with brats and the buns were so bad I gave up halfway thru and just had the brat. 

it feels sort of silly to care so much and be on this weird emotional rollercoaster about something that feels so small but it also feels enormous. We are going on a vacation this weekend with some friends and i'm getting a headache trying to figure out how to eat along the way. What to eat when we get there. I have a followup appt with the dr tomorrow and I'm going to ask ""hey is it like- no cross contamination get a new toaster level no gluten vs just don't eat bread no gluten"" bc that would be great to know. I am obviously hoping for the latter. It's kind of way more emotional and hard than I thought it would be to finally get answers. I've been sick for years and I was longing so bad for answers and I finally have them and now I'm crying more than I did when I was sick. It feels like a weirdly terminal diagnosis- like a thing that's with me forever. Until I die. That feels really awful and scary. Even though it's something that's sort of small in the grand scheme of things. 

I just have a lot of emotions about it. I wonder what I will cry about next lol. 

Plz feel free to drop any tips, recommended recipes/product subs/advice! My husband is a sweetie and is looking forward to experimenting and figuring out how to make our recipes and such with no gluten, and I'm lucky to have him, but i'm just feeling this overwhelming feeling of sadness and stress at how big this feels.

We immediately hit it off insanely well. From the first time I saw her I thought she was extremely beautiful and within a week I was driving her to/from work everyday. We continued to hit it off, and by the time we were a few weeks in we were texting all day at work, going on breaks throughout the day to the lunch-room and vending machines to spend time with each other, and having so much fun at work. She started making clear advances on me such as asking me to come over and watch a movie, go out to a bar and play pool, saying she wanted to see what my apartment looked like. Unfortunately at this point I was a little overwhelmed and personally conflicted because previous to this, I was kind of avoiding getting into any relationships for a decent period of time and just doing my own thing.

Eventually though, I decided I wanted to go for it and picked up the flirting more directly. One day after work in mid-may we went to dave and busters, got some drinks and had such an amazing time. She was so happy, told me she had such a great time, and for me it was the best time I had ever had with a girl in a really really long time. Couldn't have gone better in my opinion. The following 2 weeks after that she got really busy with meetings and events after work so we weren't able to go on any more dates, but I picked up the flirting quite a bit and she seemed to be really enjoying it and reciprocating it and I felt we were having such a great time. Honestly at this point she was making me feel so happy, and I had really fallen for her. I got her a couple small gifts (got some of her favorite candy, got her a coffee etc.), made some nice gestures and continued flirting during this 2 weeks of business. She then tells me the next few weeks her meetings aren't going on so she is going to have a bunch of free time. So, I ask her out. When I ask her she looks so happy, beaming from ear to ear and blushing. She immediately tells me when she is free and I put my name down in her planner. Unfortunately, I had to cancel this plan because I had to go home for my brothers graduation. But, the next week, I ask her out again, she again smiles, tells me when she is free, and we have a date. I book us for an adult mini-golf place w/ drinks and such that she said she has been wanting to go to.

Unfortunately, the day-of she tells me ""don't hate me but I had some plans come up and I can't do mini-golf anymore"" and she tells me the plans which is a graduation party for some of her close friends, understandable. Keep in mind, during this 2 week timeframe we are not texting as much and things have definitely changed a bit since the beginning rush but the vibe at work still seems good and I am still flirting. I come in this week, and it seems like she is really pushing me away and seems disinterested in my flirting. She still talks to me normally when we are together in the car and we have some good times but I am picking up a lot of signs that she is really disinterested all the sudden.

What would you guys do in the situation? I am a big over-thinker and this relationship has given me some anxiety because I feel like I have had some mixed signals. I feel like I should talk to her on Monday (she is out the rest of the week) and tell her how I feel and ask if she feels the same way but I am hesitant and nervous. I am really into this girl and feel like this is slipping away.",2,1750291796.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

**Key Financial Metrics (FY 2025 vs. FY 2024):**
- Net Sales: $8.73 billion (up 7% from $8.18B)
- Adjusted Operating Income: $1.82B (up 12%)
- Adjusted EPS (diluted): $10.12 (up 2%)
- Net Loss (GAAP): $(1.23)B, or $(11.57) per share (vs. prior year Net Income of $744M)
- Gross Profit: $3.38B (up 9%)
- Free Cash Flow: $817M (up from $643M)
- Shareholders‚Äô Equity: $6.08B (down from $7.69B)
- Total Debt: $7.68B
- Dividend: $4.32/share annualized

**Major Transactions:**
- **Acquisition:** Hostess Brands acquired for ~$5.5B, adding Hostess¬Æ to the portfolio (notable brands: Donettes, Twinkies, CupCakes).
- **Divestitures:** Sold Sweet Baked Snacks value brands (March 2025), Voortman (December 2024), Canada condiment business, and Sahale Snacks, continuing portfolio optimization.

**Segment Performance:**
- **U.S. Retail Coffee**: $2.81B sales (+4%), segment profit margin 28.3%
- **U.S. Retail Frozen Handheld & Spreads**: $1.88B sales (+3%), margin 22.7%
- **U.S. Retail Pet Foods**: $1.66B sales (-9%), margin 27.6%
- **Sweet Baked Snacks**: $1.18B sales (+85%, Hostess impact), margin 18.6%
- **International & Away From Home**: $1.20B (~flat), margin 20.6%

**Key Risks:**
- **Impairment:** $1.98B in pre-tax noncash impairment charges, primarily in goodwill and intangible assets related to Sweet Baked Snacks/Hostess acquisition, resulting in net GAAP loss. Goodwill and trademark values here remain at ongoing risk for further impairment.
- **Leverage:** High debt from Hostess acquisition; total debt at $7.68B, with significant upcoming obligations.
- **Commodity & Supply Chain:** Continued inflation and volatility in commodity and supply chain costs (especially green coffee, peanuts, oils & fats).
- **Customer Concentration:** Walmart accounts for 33% of net sales‚Äîloss could materially impact revenue.
- **Competitive Environment:** Facing strong branded and private label competition in all segments.
- **Legal & Regulatory:** Subject to consumer litigation (notably around Jif peanut butter recall), regulatory compliance, and evolving environmental/climate change regulations.
- **Integration:** Challenges remain in realizing anticipated synergies from the Hostess acquisition; retention of customers and key personnel is crucial.

**Liquidity & Capital Resources:**
- Generated $1.21B cash from operations; capital expenditures at $393.8M.
- $459.8M dividends projected for FY26.
- New $650M term loan and expanded credit facility support liquidity.
- No material off-balance sheet obligations.

**Management Discussion/Outlook:**
- Strategic focus is on growing thru premium branded products and portfolio realignment (Hostess addition, divestitures).
- Continues margin enhancement and cash discipline initiatives.
- Market and economic conditions remain volatile, but underlying brands are performing, and operating cash flow remains strong.
- Integration of Hostess Brands is a primary operational focus.
- Investment in supply chain and automation continues.

**Investor Takeaways:**
- Strong brands and cash generation, but headline GAAP loss due to large impairment following Hostess acquisition.
- Leverage has increased; interest expense rising.
- Success of Hostess integration and future impairment risk are key monitoring points.
- Portfolio rationalization continues.
- Commitment to dividend remains intact.
- Significant risks from commodity volatility, single large customer concentration, and competitive intensity.

Overall, Smucker is at a period of transition following a major acquisition, with a focus on brand leadership and margin improvement against a backdrop of heightened financial and operational risk.

I love lighter coffee roasts, but I brew almost exclusively espresso at home. As much as I enjoy a good single origin, they're tougher to dial in (especially with lighter profiles) and I've been coming around to how great blends can be for espresso. Right now, I have a weekly subscription with Push X Pull. They're my favorite roaster in town right now, but it's a small 10oz bag that I get weekly. At that size, I find myself wishing I had more time to enjoy the coffee since I'm spending time dialing in a new single origin every week. I also brew a mix of cappuccinos/cortados with straight espresso, so only half of my shots end up being shots that let the single origin shine through. They do have one blend, but only as a 2 lb. monthly. It's admittedly a great deal at $24, but it also never changes, so I know I'd get bored after a while.

I used to subscribe to Ritual's [seasonal espresso blend](https://ritualcoffee.com/shop/coffee/red-flag-seasonal-espresso/) and liked it a lot; the blend is good, it's roasted on the lighter side, and it changes every few months, so I mostly don't need to worry about dial-in aside from small tweaks after the first few days. I'd love to find something similar to this in Portland so that I can shop local and don't need to get coffee shipped to me.

I currently have the Sony WH-1000XM4, and for the past 5 years they were my go to for everything. Needing to sleep on a long road trip? I wore them. Needed to get work done in a busy coffee shop? I had them. But these past few months, the problems I have been having have compounded on each other.

It started with my headphones constantly disconnecting then reconnecting with my phone. Then, the sound cutting out multiple times within a 10 minute setting. Finally, a high pitched whistle sound that could easily damage someone's ears.

I found work arounds for all of the problems, but I basically can't use noise cancelling anymore because I either need to turn off any form of noise isolation or use them wired.

This leads me to my search for finding new headphones. My budget is $150. I would prefer to stay in this range, so I don't mind getting used.

Anyone else?,"Not entirely sure where to post this but trying to find anyone else who has dealt with this if anyone or if I just got a dud.. 

Really invested in this Infant Optics baby monitor system, we have 3 cameras + camera stands + different lenses, etc. I really liked the system but recently it just stopped charging which is basically making the thing useless as a baby monitor - I can leave it on a charger all night, unplug in the morning and it dies before I even get down stairs to make some coffee. 

  
I emailed customer service hoping for a fix, I purchased a new battery off amazon (same problem) its an issue with the unit I guess but without 'proof of purchase' they are giving me such a hard time regardless of sending pictures of the serial #, etc. For reference it was a gift from my baby shower which was 2+ years ago and who knew but Target takes down baby registrys after 18 months so no way to even find the 'baby registry' to validate. 

  
All to say also, if we have to invest in a whole new system - any recommendations? The Infant Optics monitor (without battery) is going for $114 alone and so I'm annoyed to have to replace the unit after just two years when I really think it should have lasted longer than this, or at least replacing the battery should have been enough.. but I already spent the $15 there sooo frustrating. 

I'd ideally like something that allows at least 2 cameras (if not more) Ideally we liked that Infant Optics allows up to 4 because we have 3 currently, one over each crib (twins) and one overlooking the entire room but when we move them to separate rooms I planned to add a 4th camera. I don't want WiFi or any type of app. 

If there even is another system that will work, I'm just so annoyed this monitor lasted literally 2 years and now I have to spend another $115+ to keep using this system. What a scam. lol. ",1,1750291385.0,toddlers,2,1.0,False

Because of that my professors like me and we kinda have a bond. I mean they all know my name and i sometimes grab coffee with some of them. 

I have always dreamt of uni like having a super cool friend group, sitting in cafe and talking about nonsense and yk the whole uni package. But it wasn‚Äôt like that. I don‚Äôt have any friends. I don‚Äôt talk to anybody. I just come to classes and then just go home. As you see I‚Äôm not an introvert but this whole thing makes me think i am one. They are all friends from the prep classes which i passed at the start of the year so also they are at least 1 year older than me. 

Recently our finals week has started and because i come to classes and have a relationship with the professors everybody text me like do you know the exam subjects? Or like what did the professor said about exam. They ofc said some things, where to study or where not to study etc. and also when we grabbed coffee i brought up the finals not so obviously and they gave me some informations at that times too. 

But because of this relationship w my classmates i decided to not give any information about anything. I did reply their text but I didn‚Äôt say anything specific. I always said idk or professors didn‚Äôt really talk about it. And tomorrow is our last day and some of our earlier exams are in the system. Even though i always come to classes and i am close with professors I‚Äôm not that successful. I have a 2.4 gpa and I‚Äôm failing 2 classes if I don‚Äôt get higher on next weeks make up exams.

But they are all texting me that I manipulated them and not sharing what professors said and that makes me a horrible person. 

Idc about what they think since i know that I‚Äôm not responsible for sharing the exam subjects and all the stuff but I‚Äôm curious Was i  too petty? Should i had share everything to keep the peace? 

Edit: if i had at least a little relationship w them i would‚Äôve definitely shared all i know.

My father (55M) agreed to allow me continue living with him and his girlfriend if I was either in school or working a full time job. I currently work a full time job and live with them.

I am being examined for ASD and ADHD. I have always struggled with social cues, understanding people, being blunt, and controlling my emotions. I tear up if I feel the slightest twinge of emotion; even if I'm not sad. I feel ridiculous sometimes, but that isn't the point.

These are the current circumstances, but there's a lot of context here that I need to unearth. Honestly, I'm struggling to find where to start. But, my therapist of 10+ years cannot accomodate my schedule anymore, and I really need input from a third party. So here we go.

-

My stepmom, as well as her two sons(the oldest one a little older than me and the youngest one is my younger brother's (19M) age), has been living with my dad, as well as my brother and I, since 2011-2012. My mom (54F) lives alone, and has since my parents' divorce in 2009.

Long story short, my mom, who I trusted when I was younger, fed me lies about my dad and his girlfriend as I grew up. She claimed he cheated on her, his GF was 'the other woman,' and other things. In my later teenage years, I pieced together that my mother is a narcissist who had been emotionally abusing me and my brother since not long after the divorce. Constant guilt tripping. Control. 'If you leave me for your dad I think I might k*ll myself' type of shit. I couldn't hang out with my friends or do my homework out of fear that she'd be upset. So, I got out and started living with my dad full time.

I was abrasive and rude to my father's girlfriend up until I started having doubts about my mother's intentions/actions/words. My dad never aired their dirty laundry to me; which, looking back, is probably a pretty good hint that he was in fact moreso the victim of the situation than my mom; and she played victim to the point I wanted to 'avenge' her. But, I started having these doubts, since my dad had been nothing but kind to me up to then. One day, during conversation, being 10+ years since the split, I asked what pushed him to do it. To 'cheat' on mom. He asked me why I thought he cheated on her. I told him, and he was beyond upset, although a lot of my behavior made sense to him in that moment. We cried, we apologized, and we talked for hours about what really happened. How much my mom had been doing behind closed doors to me and my brother. How much it hurt and warped my perception of my dad and his family. This was maybe 2-3 years ago, now.

I see my mother once a month for coffee, for an hour; per my dad's condition of living with him full time. Since then, he has asked me why I don't go no-contact. I honestly don't know why I can't seem to let go of someone who hurt me so much, but I still see her. Our relationship has improved since I left her home.

I have apologized to my dad's GF numerous times. Cried. Begged for forgiveness. Tried to explain. Took ownership of my actions even though they were caused by an outside, angry factor.

Before anyone butts in saying ""Years of that behavior won't be undone instantly,"" I know. I'm very aware. Painfully aware. Please, please hold on before you comment.

Ever since, I've tried to be kind and friendly to my stepmom. But it's like acting kind and friendly makes it worse. My dad has told me that ""It's like there's a wall between you two. You both tell me how you want to be closer to one another, and you both are visibly upset by the distance, but you can't seem to overcome it."" I want to believe him more than anything, because I know I've cried a lot over wishing I could take it all back and how much I wish we were closer.

4/5 months ago, she and I went out to coffee. It went really, really well. We ended up talking from 2PM until we went to sleep. We sat in the coffee shop for 3 hours; just talking. About books. About tea. About her plants. About my passion for baking. About what my mom really did to me (I'm excluding a lot of her actions from this as they are irrelevant, but I am still turning the corner on accepting that she s*x*ally abused me from the time of the divorce, well into my teenage years.) She told me how her life was growing up; how much her brother meant to her. How much mine means to me. She cried for me. I cried for her. We went home and cooked dinner and made mocktails and watched movies. She said we should do that again. I eagerly agreed; I have wanted this kind of motherly relationship since as long as I can remember. My mother was never this easy to talk to, this happy. I wanted to do this often.

Even though that happened, the constant feeling of distance and the gut feeling that she wants me to leave the house has only grown.

2 months pass, and her birthday rolls around. I write her a card and purchase her a custom sweater off of Etsy and write that the next coffee day is on me..just to let me know when and where. Just as a reminder that I'd like to do that again the way she said we could.

She's always cold to me aside from that day. I've continued my efforts to be warm and open and friendly; to a point my dad made it a point to commend me for my effort. He tells me he sees me offering a hug to her the way I do for him, and my wanting to include and talk to her; but he doesn't understand what her issue seems to be. He knows that I'm trying really hard to mend it and move past my mistakes.

She's so warm towards my brother. She's warm to her kids. She makes them breakfast, and asks what they want on the grocery list.

She makes dinner late knowing I have to go to bed early and won't be able to join. She ignores me, her parents talk down to me. My dad has started to be more irritated with me as this gets worse, even though my efforts persist.

-

I've considered moving out, for many reasons. In this economy it'd be really hard to make it on my own, but I may not have a choice for my mental health. However, that's also not simple.

My boyfriend(21M, 1 semester away from graduating college) of 2+ years wants me to move in with him. However, he lives with his mom(46F?) and younger sister (17F) and I'm uncomfortable with putting pressure like that on his mom and pushing into their space. Taking up space is something I never want to do.

I mentioned my thoughts of moving out to an apartment of my own to him, and he got really upset with me. ""Why not move in with me?"" And how it'd be difficult to keep dating me if I did. How he wants me to move in so it's easier to date. He doesn't really engage with me when I'm over, he plays single player video games that he knows I'm not into for hours on end. I feel neglected a lot over there. We are not engaged. He doesn't really come over to my house, it's always me going over there every. Weekend. It's draining to go into a foreign space for several days. (Also, I have celiac disease, so food concerns are big with me.)

-

Please, do I just need to try harder with my dad's GF? What's going on here? Is my gut telling me that she wants me out right after all? Why can't we move past it? Do I ask about coffee again? Do I make a plan to move out?

-

TL;DR-- I was rude to my stepmom growing up due to lies my mom fed me, I figured it out and have been apologizing to her ever since. Gut tells me she hates me. Moving out is murky because it could break my boyfriend and I up. I'm lost mentally.

1lewbhq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1lewbhq/a_20year_friendship_quietly_ended_after_i/,"A 20-year friendship quietly ended after I supported him financially. Now I think about it every day, not out of missing him but confusion","One of my closest friends and I had been tight for 20 years. A while back, he lost his job and I supported him financially. Not by handing him cash directly, but by covering meals, entertainment, going out, things like cafes, movies, etc. He lives with his parents, so he didn‚Äôt have to pay rent or food, but I was covering a lot of our outings while he was unemployed.

Eventually, things got better for him and he landed a job. He told me he was going to start paying off his credit card debt first and then begin paying me back in installments. Around the same time, we had a chance to travel together to Thailand. I figured we could do the trip and deal with the money part later. I tried to make it clear I wasn‚Äôt pressuring him and honestly, it wasn‚Äôt about the money. It was more about priorities and mutual respect.

That trip turned out to be one of the worst experiences I‚Äôve had. He refused to use the Splitwise app, which I always use with my other friends to split costs, and he generally seemed uninterested in keeping track of anything. I ended up spending most of the trip alone. We only met up to have dinner together. At one point he asked me for some baht (Thai currency). I told him I couldn‚Äôt lend it. For context: I had bought it before my trip from my sister, who had just been to Thailand a couple of months earlier. She had a large amount of baht, enough to cover my whole trip, so I bought it off her instead of exchanging dollars. I never explained this to him directly, but he was aware that I had baht on hand. He looked clearly upset, but didn‚Äôt say anything.

Later, I told him I could give him some baht (Thai currency) if he returned it in baht as well, so I wouldn‚Äôt lose money on the exchange rate. He responded with obvious disappointment and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything from you.‚Äù I said okay and left it there.

We flew back separately. I flew business class and he flew economy. I think that also bothered him, as if it confirmed some idea that I was stingy or looking down on him. After that, we didn‚Äôt speak for two months.

Eventually, I messaged him and said it had been two months and maybe we should catch up. Not because I missed him, but out of respect for our long friendship. He agreed and we set a time. On the day, I followed up to confirm and he canceled, saying something came up and asked to meet the next week instead. I said okay. An hour later, he sent me a random park location on WhatsApp with no context. I didn‚Äôt know what he meant. Was it a mistake? Was he meeting other people and forgot I existed? I ignored it and honestly, I didn‚Äôt really care by that point.

The next week he picked me up and we got coffee. The conversation was cold and dry. He only talked about work, then made a phone call and stayed on it for a while in front of me. After the call, we chatted briefly, then he suddenly dropped me off at my house without saying he had to leave or asking if I was okay with it. The whole interaction felt awkward and dismissive.

He also completely stopped talking to my mother, who he used to be in regular contact with. She still asks me about him regularly, genuinely worried. She doesn‚Äôt know anything about what happened, or even that he lost his job. I just tell her he‚Äôs doing fine and keep it vague. I don‚Äôt see a reason to involve her in any of it.

And the kicker is, he never paid me back, not a single penny. Later, I found out he had traveled to Japan.

I later caught up with a mutual friend who asked me what happened between us. I told him that after Thailand, we met once and never spoke again. That mutual friend told me he had heard from him that I care more about money than friendship, and that he had ‚Äúbeen there for me‚Äù and ‚Äúhelped me out‚Äù before, which is absolutely false. Nothing he ever did for me would justify that kind of statement.

That same friend also said he‚Äôs been frustrated with him too. He said he refuses to grow or change and seems to be stuck in a depressive spiral.

Right now, I don‚Äôt think about him because I miss him. I think about him every day because I‚Äôm still processing how a person I knew for 20 years could flip like this. It‚Äôs not about the money. I truly don‚Äôt need it. But clearly, my rights or perspective meant nothing to him, and everything I did or didn‚Äôt do got twisted into something negative.

I have other friends. This isn‚Äôt about loneliness or not having people. But this whole thing made me re-evaluate what I thought I knew about friendship, dignity, and mutual respect.


I don‚Äôt know why I still think about it every day. I‚Äôm not sad. Just surprised, still.

1lew6m5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lew6m5,Found one. Didn't end well.,"Been casually looking for a Switch 2. Today I was driving between work sites and stopped at two different Walmarts. At the second one I find a Mario Kart edition sitting in the case and couldn't believe my luck.
Guy finally comes over to help get it out of the case and we bring it up to the electronics counter. He tells me it is an open box return so we open it to inspect. Physically it's fine, everything seems there. 
Notice that the Mario Kart code is scratched off (it's like a scratch-off lottery ticket with the coffee previously covered). Hmm. Naturally wonder if the original buyer redeemed the code and returned the system. 
They knocked $50 off the price so I figured I'd roll the dice and at least have the hardware. Bought a Pro Controller 2 while I was at it. 
Finally after work I get a chance to set it up. Quickly realize I need the super special micro SD card and none of the ~half dozen in the house would work. Drive ten minutes to Target and get one there and pick up a few other accessories as well. 
Get home and go to finish the setup- quickly get Error Code 2124-4508. A quick Google search shows me I'm screwed. FML.

Thankfully my local Walmart accepted the return without any fuss but still... I wish nothing but enthusiastic double gonorrhea to the lowlife scum that did this.

In 1893, the name of the hotel was changed to ‚ÄúThe National Hotel.‚Äù Destroyed by fire in 1958. After the site was cleaned up, then First National Bank was built on the former hotel site in 1959.","Anson County Historical Society June 2012 Newsletter Page 4, by Mr. John J. Dunlap ‚Äì

The Hearne Hotel on West Wade Street was opened in uptown Wadesboro in 1881 by Mrs. Mary D. Hearne. It was one of the best small-town hotels in Central North Carolina. Another well-known hotel was the Klondike Hotel which was located one block away on the corner of Martin Street & Rutherford Street. It was unusual for a town the size of Wadesboro to have two luxurious hotels. Both motels¬†were three stories tall.

On the first floor of the Hearne Hotel, was the lobby, bar, office, storage & baggage room, a spacious dining room & stairway leading up to the second & third floors. The second floor included a parlor & bedrooms. The third floor was also designed for guest rooms. The building was made of brick with a tin roof, ornamental in front with galvanized cornices, iron balconies.

In 1893 the Hearne Hotel was sold at auction by order of the Superior Court for the payment of debts. The hotel was purchased by a group of investors, which included Mr. J. D. Mills. The name of the hotel was changed to ‚ÄúThe National Hotel.‚Äù

The National Hotel Company sold the hotel in 1912 to Mr. J. D. Mills. He operated the hotel until his passing in 1942. The Mills family continued operating the hotel for a number of years. Mr. Vic Davids who was an Englishman & his wife Mattie, managed the hotel & coffee shop during this time period.

The National Hotel became a popular stop for traveling salesmen & other regular visitors to Anson. It was well known for its good food, especially when Mrs. Mills was in charge. It was a great place to go for Sunday lunch.

In the 1930‚Äôs, Queen City Coach Company buses stopped in front of the hotel to load & unload passengers, just like the stage coaches of the 1800‚Äôs did at Buck‚Äôs Tavern & Burns Inn (Leavitt House).

Ms. Ruth Berry, who was a daughter of Mr. & Mrs. Mils, sold the hotel to D. B. Goodman Furniture Company in 1956, but unfortunately this beautiful building was destroyed by fire in 1958.

The Klondike Hotel on Rutherford Street was destroyed by fire in the early 1930‚Äôs. I wish I knew more details about this old hotel. During the total eclipse of the sun in May of 1900, many world astronomers spent the week at the Klondike Hotel & National Hotel. The loss of the National Hotel represented the end of a glorious era in Wadesboro & Anson County.

I only wish there was much more detailed information to report regarding these two old hotels in Wadesboro.

(Steve Bailey's notes - There are no known photos of the Klondike Hotel. Photo posted below of ""The National Hotel."" The National Hotel & Coffee Shop was located on West Wade Street in Wadesboro where the old bank building is located. The hotel was destroyed by fire in 1958. Had been in existence since the 1890's. After the site was cleaned up, then First National Bank was built in 1959 & in the early 2000's the name was changed to BB&T Bank & then about 2008 or 2009 ago a brand-new BB&T Bank was built on the corner of Highway 74 West & Highway 109 North. Currently the old bank building on West Wade Street is home to Liberty Home Care & Hospice. Thanks to John Thomas Williams of Albemarle NC for sharing this photo with me in 2019).

1lew043,https://i.redd.it/tavcmb15nr7f1.png,I had to make my own alignment chart. I have detailed explanations for some of these! Let me know what you think?,"I saw a post from earlier and it just bugged me that Ben Horne was in True Neutral. Plus, I had the itch to use photoshop today. Here's a quick explanation for everything:  
  
**Lawful Good:** Briggs is straightforward. A lawful good character typically acts with compassion and always with honor and a sense of duty. However, lawful good characters will often regret taking any action they fear would violate their code. He *could* at times help Cooper's investigation, but that info is confidential.  
  
**Neutral Good:** 100 percent Cooper, I would lump Sheriff Truman or Log Lady in here as well. They're good but they're not afraid to bend the rules for the greater good (i.e. Book House Boys, etc.). Lots of beloved Twin Peaks characters slot in here.  
  
**Chaotic Good:** Mike is a force of good, but he knocks people out, he's unpredictable, does whatever is necessary for good even if it's bat shit crazy.  
  
**Lawful Neutral:** Lawful Neutral characters are pragmatic and goal-oriented, aligning themselves with authority figures to maintain societal order. **They follow laws and customs strictly, even if they may seem unjust. This is Albert.** Example: Not wanting Laura Palmer's body to be buried yet because he feels that he needs to do more tests, despite the wishes of the town and her family.   
  
**True Neutral:** Dougie Jones. I mean what could be more true neutral than what's going on with Dougie Jones. He has no allegiance to anyone. He want the coffee, he want the pie.  
  
**Chaotic Neutral:** A Chaotic Neutral character strives for freedom and individuality above all else. They will break any rules to do what‚Äôs best for them. I think Bobby is an example of this, but depending on the point in time of the series, it can potentially swing to something else. He has a problem with authority good or bad, but ends up becoming an authority figure in The Return.   
  
**Lawful Evil:** This one was tough. A lawful evil character sees a well-ordered system as being necessary to fulfill their own personal wants and needs, using these systems to further their power and influence. I had hard time thinking of someone that fit this bill but the best I could do was find a corrupt official type. I also thought of Deputy Chad Broxford for this. Let me know what you think.  
  
**Neutral Evil:** A neutral evil character is typically selfish and has no qualms about turning on allies-of-the-moment, and usually makes allies primarily to further their own goals. I'd also lump Catherine in here, and a lot of other shady characters to be honest.  
  
**Chaotic Evil:** Of course Bob, throw in anything coming out of the atom bomb, Windom Earle, Mr. C, etc. There's a lot to choose from. A chaotic evil character tends to have no respect for rules, other people's lives, or anything but their own desires.

My name is Ava and I am the union delegate for a coffee Roastery based out of Brunswick East in Melbourne. We have been attempting negotiations for an EBA for nearly a year now, but have been stonewalled by our employer; Seven Miles Coffee Company, the operators of our site Padre Coffee.

Our claims for a living wage, paid gender affirmation leave, social inclusion policies, and additional paid leave for first nations people have all been left unacknowledged. Liverpool Partners - the private equity fund whom populate several seats on the board of directors of Seven Miles - see no benefit to budgeting for a living wage and robust social inclusion policies.

Our team are struggling to pay their rent, bills, even afford to bring lunch to work. We are seeking to have our values reflected in an agreement and I am sharing our petition to help bolster our ongoing campaign to improve the working conditions for all of us, and set new precedents within the coffee industry which has too long benefited from paying low wages and highly casualised workplaces to generate profit.

If ya'll could please sign and share this amongst your networks, not only will our quality of lives be improved at Padre Coffee, it will lay the groundwork for other workers in the industry to push for the wages and rights that they deserve!",11,1750289420.0,AusUnions,10,0.93,False

I‚Äôve been working out on and off (mostly off) since 2018, and some of that has been strength training. The problem is that I genuinely CANNOT stay motivated to do the exercises. I can get myself to the gym, but I‚Äôll genuinely do one set and be so bored that I feel like I‚Äôm on the verge of tears and so I just go home. 

My strategies so far:
- only doing cardio: I could do cardio forever cuz I feel the adrenaline and I can watch YouTube shorts or sm while I do it
- cranking my music volume up all the way because then my brain feels tingly and stimulated and it‚Äôs fine but I think my ears are suffering 

Otherwise, I feel this extreme sense of boredom and I just go home. It‚Äôs not a physical thing‚ÄîI have the energy and strength to continue, and I‚Äôm not worried about the pain or anything, I just get BOREDDDDD!!! 

I‚Äôm sorry if this sounds lazy or like I‚Äôm complaining but I‚Äôd really like to get back into exercising, but I really struggle with finding the mental strength to overcome this boredom. I have ADHD and this has been an ongoing issue for as long as I can remember, even when I was at my peak physical condition. Coffee and my stimulant medication don‚Äôt help with this either because I just feel üò¥üôÇüå∏ and I feel like I need to feel ü¶Åüë∫üí™ to workout successfully.

1levr2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1levr2c/where_do_i_go_from_here/,Where do I go from here.,"I'm 21 and unemployed. I left my job of two years about a month ago as front of house staff at a prestigious steakhouse because I was feeling burnt out, and starting to resent the work. I have a pretty decent resume for someone my age and a very solid work ethic. I am not a student and my highest level of education is my High School diploma. I'm trying to get out of restaurant work because I simply have no passion for hospitality but I've spent what feels like forever at my old job and now I can't picture myself working outside of foodservice. 

When I go on Indeed to look for jobs in my area, it feels like employers aren't taking applications seriously whatsoever. I also feel like I see mainly weird pyramid-scheme sounding sales and marketing jobs that offer ridiculous pay for entry level positions. I just don't know where I should go from here. I have money saved up and I don't need to find work urgently, I'm just wondering what direction I should be moving in from here. I want to experience different lines of work in different fields to get a taste of what I really enjoy doing, but I don't really know where to start. I don't want to default to food service because I'm pretty much over it (at least for the moment) and I want to explore my options as a younger individual. 

I'm not even looking for great pay, I just want to be able to pay my rent and bills and enjoy the work I do. I'm just a little lost and would love it if people could provide maybe some suggestions as to some jobs they worked that don't have crazy qualification requirements and that were somewhat rewarding. I'll list some jobs I've worked and how I felt about those environments.

Dutch Bros Barista - Good atmosphere but too much emphasis on interpersonal relationships, I enjoy having friends at my job but I want something that feels more impactful than coffee

Steakhouse Barback - I enjoyed the fast pace of the bar and how competent and hardworking our small team was, but once again- hospitality has burnt me out and feels completely repetitive

Lawn Care Applicator - Honestly really chill job. Got to be outside, work with my hands, and while I did have a team and a boss, I spent most of my time completely by myself. A little lonely though

What are some fields of work with entry level positions people found enjoyable? I'm thinking about my future- and I realize I won't know what I want to do with my life for maybe the next 15 years, but I want to start looking. I need new experiences and I don't know where to find them. ",1,1750288850.0,jobsearchhacks,0,1.0,False

He had a dentist appt for next week anyway, so the dentist just said to keep the appt and keep an eye on it. He seemed to be feeling good today, but then came inside from riding bikes and threw up everywhere. He has a high fever, so we gave him bath and motrin and I called dentist and left a message.

‚Ä¢ Work in an English-speaking team  
‚Ä¢ Casual convos still feel awkward to keep up  
‚Ä¢ Group chats? I mostly stay quiet and just try to follow üòÖ

‚Ä¢ Someone to talk with regularly and get used to the *real vibe* of English  
‚Ä¢ Talk about IELTS-style topics ‚Äî each of us using our target language, either by speaking or writing mini-essays

üîπ **My interests:**  
‚Ä¢ Movies (classic, sci-fi, anime)  
‚Ä¢ Video games (a lot of nerdy stuff on Steam ‚Äî and sometimes I pretend I‚Äôm good at Valorant)  
‚Ä¢ Visual effects & 3D animation (I work in FX)  
‚Ä¢ Walking around the city & coffee hunting ‚òï  
‚Ä¢ Random thoughts, cultural differences, and talking about ‚Äúsmall life things‚Äù

Ideally, your Korean is at a similar level to my English so we can both benefit.

He stinks of bourbon and shame and still they come. The Women. The press. The second chances. He lumbers, squints, carries his coffee like a threat. He looks perpetually hungover, half-asleep, mildly disgusted with everything, including himself. And yet the women keep coming. They always have. Not because of his wit or discipline or warmth. He has none. They come because he is tall and handsome in the way a statue is handsome, which is to say: cold, unmoved, and carved for worship. He dated Gwyneth Paltrow at her apex, when she ruled Hollywood like a queen with a candle empire still to come. He grew tired of her. He moved on. Then came Jennifer Lopez, the first time, when she was an icon, not yet a brand. He filmed ‚ÄúGigli,‚Äù destroyed both their reputations, and still ended up in her bed. He left. Years passed. She built a billion-dollar empire and trained like a gladiator. He reappeared looking like the ghost of a Celtics fan and she married him anyway. In between, he married Jennifer Garner, the wholesome one, the wife America approved of. He had three children with her, grew bored, drank, banged the nanny, and moved on. He dated Lindsay Shookus, a successful television producer with connections and pedigree, but she too was a detour. He spent some time with Ana de Armas, the most luminous woman in Hollywood at the time, and still managed to look bored on dog walks. He briefly took up with Shauna Sexton, a Playboy model half his age, who photographed him like a prize bull in a roadside motel. There were others. Actresses, musicians, anonymous blondes, fleeting distractions. Their names don't matter. They orbit him, then vanish. Even the rumored ones are more beautiful than most men‚Äôs reality. Now he is back with Lopez. She is surgically perfect, always posed, perpetually lit from within. He stands beside her like a man who can‚Äôt believe his luck and doesn‚Äôt care. She posts for the camera. He lights another cigarette. He always looks like he‚Äôs trying to disappear. She clings to him anyway.

Ben Affleck is not kind. He is not clever. He is not even sober half the time. But he is Tall. In this world, Tall is enough.

Damon is 5\`10\`\`and it shows. He married the first woman who smiled at him over a bar rail. She already had a child. That was fine. That was it. He has barely ever gotten laid afaik.

Tom Cruise built a religion to get laid.

Daniel Radcliffe? Emma Watson looked through him like glass.

Efron is shredded like marble and alone like a ghost.

Elijah Wood never stood a chance. He has the face of a porcelain doll and the height of a Victorian child. He played Frodo. He disappeared. Women call him ‚Äúsweet.‚Äù That‚Äôs code. That‚Äôs death.

Rami Malek. Oscar in hand. Jaw like a blade. Still he gives off the smell of someone who asks to kiss you. 5\`7\`\`. Women keep him around like an art piece. Unthreatening. Odd. Sexless.

Jesse Eisenberg. Quick with the tongue. Fast with the thought. He does interviews like knife fights. Still no one swoons. 5\`7\`\` and shrinking.

Shia LaBeouf tried to punch through it. Feral. Mad. Dirty. Scummy. Didn‚Äôt matter. 5\`9\`\`. The rage was not enough. They called him ‚Äúintense,‚Äù not irresistible.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Charming. Smooth. Can sing. Can dance. Women love the *idea* of him. But he‚Äôs 5\`9\`\` and has never looked down at anyone in his life. You don‚Äôt lust for a man who makes eye contact with your clavicle.

Michael Cera. 5\`9\`\` in a dream. Women laugh with him. Never at night. He plays the boy who wants you but never wins. Because he *is* the boy who wants you and never wins.

Jonathan Taylor Thomas? Remember him? He was famous. Briefly. Then puberty came and asked how tall he was. He answered wrong. The world moved on. He became gay in order to get laid.

Josh Hutcherson. Peeta. Spent three films simping for Katniss. Never had a chance. 5\`5\`\`. She towered over him. She kissed him out of pity. America watched. What a Joke.

Meanwhile:  
Jason Momoa?  
Travis Kelce?  
Jacob Elordi?  
Hemsworth(s)?  
Chris Pine?  
Chris Evans?  
Chris Everything?

Alexander Skarsg√•rd. 6\`4\`\`. Nordic. Barely speaks. Doesn‚Äôt have to. Took down Nicole Kidman on screen and Rihanna off screen. That's a r√©sum√©.

Armie Hammer. 6\`5\`\`. A cannibal, allegedly. Women *still* hesitate when asked if they would.

Jon Hamm. 6'2"". Even his name is phallic. Draper wasn‚Äôt a character. It was a documentary.

We had a falling out because she had said something over the phone that I think I took very wrong. I was incredibly insecure and lonely at the time, with lots more going on. She said she only talked to me because I‚Äôm the only one that would respond (slightly altered, lol scared she‚Äôd see this!) and I got very upset at that. 

I did reach out later to tell her how I felt, we went to the same school aswell. 


It‚Äôs been 5-6 years now and I think it could be worth it to reach out, I don‚Äôt have really any female friends now. I really do recognise now she was a kind and thoughtful person. 

What would you do?

(Translated, would recognise me by my profile)

Hey, 

I know it has been a long time since we spoke last and I know that wasn‚Äôt on the best terms. I think you were a very good friend and it should have never blown up like it did. I am sorry for that again and I just want you to know you are a kind and sweet friend. You do not have to respond, but I am always open to reconnecting over a tea or coffee. :) ",1,1750287781.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

Just wondering if there are fellow lurkers here from San Carlos or nearby who might be up for grabbing coffee sometime. Nothing fancy just good convo, chill vibes, and maybe a new connection.

We can start with a chat muna to see if we vibe, then maybe set a coffee date if things click. No pressure. üòä
