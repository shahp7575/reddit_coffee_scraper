1jflh28,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jflh28/i_found_a_diary_in_my_new_apartment_the_last/,I Found a Diary in My New Apartment. The Last Entry Is Dated Tomorrow.,"I moved into my new apartment last week. It’s a small, one-bedroom place in a building that’s been around since the 1920s. The rent was cheap, which should’ve been my first red flag, but I was desperate. The walls are thin, the floors creak, and the windows rattle when the wind blows, but it’s mine. Or at least, it was supposed to be.

The first few days were uneventful. I spent most of my time unpacking and trying to ignore the faint smell of mildew that seemed to linger in every room. But then, on the third night, I found it.

I was cleaning out the closet in the bedroom when I noticed a loose floorboard. I pried it up, expecting to find nothing but dust and maybe a few dead bugs. Instead, I found a small, leather-bound diary. It was old, the cover cracked and faded, but it was still intact.

I opened it, and the first thing I noticed was the handwriting. It was neat, almost elegant, but there was something off about it. The letters were too precise, like they’d been written by someone who was trying too hard to keep their hand steady.

The first entry was dated January 1st, 1987.

“Dear Diary,” it began, “I’ve moved into my new apartment. It’s small, but it’s mine. Or at least, it’s supposed to be.”

I froze. That was exactly what I had thought when I moved in. I shook it off as a coincidence and kept reading.

The entries were mostly mundane—grocery lists, reminders to pay the rent, complaints about the noisy neighbors. But as I read on, I noticed something strange. The writer kept mentioning a sound. A faint tapping, like someone knocking on the walls. At first, they thought it was the pipes, but then they started hearing it in other parts of the apartment. In the closet. Under the floorboards. Behind the walls.

The entries became more frantic as the days went on. The writer talked about how they couldn’t sleep, how they felt like they were being watched. They started seeing things out of the corner of their eye—shadows that moved when they shouldn’t, figures that disappeared when they turned to look.

And then, on January 15th, the entries stopped.

I flipped through the rest of the diary, expecting to find more, but the pages were blank. Except for the last one.

The last entry was dated tomorrow.

My heart skipped a beat. I checked the date on my phone, just to be sure. It was today. The entry was dated tomorrow.

I don’t know why I kept reading. Maybe it was curiosity. Maybe it was fear. But I couldn’t stop myself.

“Dear Diary,” it began, “I don’t have much time. They’re here. They’ve been here all along, waiting in the walls, in the floors, in the shadows. They’ve been watching me, listening to me, learning from me. And now they’re ready.

“If you’re reading this, it means they’ve chosen you too. They’ll start with the tapping. It’ll be soft at first, almost imperceptible. But it’ll get louder. And then you’ll hear the voices. They’ll whisper to you, call your name, beg you to let them in.

“Don’t answer them. Don’t even look at them. If you do, they’ll take you. They’ll take you like they took me.

“I’m sorry. I didn’t want to do this, but I don’t have a choice. They’re making me.

“Goodbye.”

I closed the diary, my hands trembling. I told myself it was just a prank, some sick joke left behind by the previous tenant. But deep down, I knew that wasn’t true. The handwriting was too precise, the details too specific. And the date—the date was impossible.

I spent the rest of the night sitting on the couch, clutching the diary like it was some kind of talisman. I tried to convince myself that I was overreacting, that I was just letting my imagination run wild. But then I heard it.

A faint tapping, coming from the closet.

I told myself it was just the pipes. But then I heard it again, louder this time. And then again, and again, until it was a steady rhythm, like someone knocking on the door.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. I just sat there, frozen, as the tapping grew louder and louder. And then I heard the voices.

They were faint at first, just whispers, but they grew louder, more insistent. They were calling my name, begging me to let them in.

I don’t know how long I sat there, listening to the voices, but eventually, they stopped. The tapping stopped. The apartment was silent.

I thought it was over. I thought I was safe.

But then I saw it.

Out of the corner of my eye, a shadow moved. I turned to look, but there was nothing there. Just the empty room, the flickering light of the TV, and the diary, lying open on the coffee table.

I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow. I don’t know if I’ll be able to stop them. But I do know this: if you ever find a diary in your new apartment, don’t read it.

Just don’t.

**Author’s Note:** I’m posting this because I need to know if anyone else has experienced something like this. I’ve tried to research the diary, but I can’t find any record of it. If you know anything, please, tell me. I’m starting to think I’m not alone in this.

And if you hear a voice, no matter how faint, don’t answer it.

Just don’t.

It’s 3AM, make my coffee, crack a new jug of milk, pour it in and it curdles instantly, expiration date March 30. Strike 1. Start my car to discover that one of my new tires needs air, I just put air in 2 days ago. I must have a small leak in my brand new tire. Strike 2. Head to Cumberland Farms. I hate it. The drug addicts are thick there in the early morning hours. Pull in at 4AM. There’s a man passed out in his car, a group of 4, obviously high people hanging out at the corner next to the no loitering sign. One is working his mouth aggressively and a lady’s joints are broken, she can’t keep her knees straight, her arms have a life of their own and I am nervous about and for them. I head inside and make a coffee. No syrup in my flavor. Figures… Strike 3? No, not yet, patience girl! Grab a fresh milk and get in line. Wait there while another woman, who can’t stand straight, asks the cashier about pretzels, that she doesn’t want right now. What size are they? How do you cook them? If I buy a sandwich will you warm it up for me? She steps away from the register 3 times and then returns. Her greay sweat pants are pulled up to her knees, which are buckled, she’s pointing at nothing, arms are moving senselessly. She is oblivious to her surroundings, completely unaware that I and now another customer are waiting to pay. The 5th time she stepped away I stepped forward, she returned and noticed me. She steps away again, again I take a step forward. She returns again and steps away again. The cashier waves me in. I side step into place state clearly “drugs are bad.” She looks at me and gives me space. I inform the clerk of the man passed out cold in his car directly infront of the door. I have known people who have died from that, the blood flow to their brain becomes inhibited by the unnatural bend of their necks (drugs are bad) and they die. I didn’t tell him this bit. The clerk recognizes the situation and thanks me for bringing it to his attention. I offer to wake the guy up. I didn’t earlier because I had nobody except the druggies on the corner to watch. The clerk says, “No!” He informs me that the people have been known to startle and draw weapons. I know, which is why I didn’t wake him before entering the store. The drugged up lady in the store is trying so hard to behave normally and not being successful. He says that he will call the police as store policy requires. Fine by me. I pay and head out. Now to put air in my new, leaking tire. $2.50 for what used to be free. Hook up the air line and the machine says I have 9 psi in the tire, a lie, I have 23. It then proceeded to *remove* air! I adjust and readjusted but it insists on removing air!! I give up, there goes $2.50 and I am in a worse position… 12 psi. Strike 3. Head to the Depot in Springvale. $1.50 & it works!! The first thing to go right💕 I hate Cumberland Farms in Sanford in the early morning hours. It’s time to go home and stay home. 3 strikes before 4AM, no thanks. I don’t want to play today😂

Hey MaximizeMe tribe! 🌟 Ever felt like time's running faster than Usain Bolt when you’ve got a mountain of tasks? 🤯 Yeah, me too. Let’s chat about two life-changing strategies: time blocking and energy mapping. Trust me, picking the right one might just give you back those elusive 10 hours per week. Sounds dreamy, right?

So, picture this: It's a Monday morning, coffee in hand, and your calendar looks like a game of Tetris gone wrong. You’ve heard about **time blocking** and maybe you’ve even dabbled in it. It's all about scheduling specific blocks for specific tasks. Sounds neat, but what if I told you that there’s a twist on this called **energy mapping**? ✨

**Why time blocking can rock your socks:**

1. **Structure is your friend**: Ever opened the fridge three times in 10 minutes hoping a snack fairy manifested something new? 🤔 With time blocking, you won’t have to wonder what's next.

2. **Reduces decision fatigue**: Less time deciding = more brain space for being awesome.

3. **Prevents task overlap**: Because nobody wins when you try to simultaneously write emails, host a meeting, and bake sourdough. 🍞

But... let’s see if energy mapping might tickle your fancy a bit more.

**Why energy mapping might be your jam:**

- **It’s all about YOU!**: Ever felt like a zombie at 3 PM? 🧟 Energy mapping lets you plan tasks when you’re most alert. Because who wants to fight brain fog at crunch time?

- **Flexibility is golden**: Did you wake up with the drive of a caffeinated cheetah? 🐆 Great, get those tough tasks done early. No more forcing square pegs into round holes.

- **Wave goodbye to burnout**: By matching tasks to your natural energy peaks and troughs, you’re less likely to feel like you’ve run a marathon on Monday alone.

Now, real talk: I tried both. My revelation? Combining them can be a game changer. Map your energy, then block your time. It’s like peanut butter meeting jelly – magic on toast. 🥪

Remember, it’s all about finding what fits your groove. Maybe you’re a night owl or perhaps a lark, chirping away with the sunrise. Tailor your productivity method to suit you.

So, what’s your go-to? Time blocking? Energy mapping? Or a mix that keeps you balanced and thriving? Share your thoughts, because who doesn’t love a good productivity hack? 😉",1,1742464665.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1jflbww,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1jflbww/the_day_i_stopped_stalking_ctos_on_linkedin_and/,The day I stopped stalking CTOs on LinkedIn (and started booking demos),"Remember that feeling when you hit ""send"" on a cold email you spent an hour crafting... only to be met with deafening silence?

Three months ago, I was sitting in my apartment, surrounded by empty coffee cups, staring at a spreadsheet of potential leads for my HRMS software. I had exactly zero demos booked that week, despite spending 20+ hours researching prospects.

I remember thinking, ""I didn't become a developer to spend my life doing *this*.""

That night, I made a decision that changed everything: What if I could engineer my way out of this problem?

# The experiment

I'm a technical founder, not a sales person. So I approached outreach like I would approach a coding problem:

1. I identified the pattern: Most ""personalized"" cold emails aren't actually personal - they're just mail-merged flattery
2. I built a system to truly understand prospect contexts: their tech stack, recent challenges, team structure
3. I created an AI model that could learn how *I* write when I'm genuinely interested in someone's work

The first message I sent using this system got a response in 7 minutes. Not an auto-reply—an actual conversation.

# The results

Within a month, I booked 7 demos without writing a single outreach message from scratch. The prospects didn't just reply—they were *prepared* for the calls. One CTO even said, ""This is the first cold email I've responded to in years.""

The difference wasn't ""growth hacking"" or ""sales techniques"" - it was simply making each interaction genuinely relevant to that specific person.

# Why I'm sharing this:

I've built this system into a tool called [SalesNode](https://salesnode.tech/) \- specifically for technical founders who'd rather be building products than crafting ""the perfect cold email.""

But here's where I need your input. Before I go deeper into development, I want to know:

1. Is this a ""shut up and take my money"" solution or just another ""AI toy"" in your eyes?
2. What's the most soul-crushing part of your sales process right now?
3. If you could automate one aspect of customer outreach, what would it be?

I'm not here to pitch—I'm here to build something that actually solves a problem for people like us. If this resonates with you, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

And if it doesn't? Well, my IDE is always waiting for me.",1,1742464616.0,ChatGPT,1,1.0,False

Nutrition at this stage typically focuses on being easy to digest, providing sufficient energy, and avoiding irritation to the digestive system. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Easily digestible and gentle foods for the gut**:
   * Porridge, soups, or well-cooked stews (e.g., rice porridge, potato soup, pumpkin soup).
   * Boiled or steamed vegetables like carrots, zucchini, or sweet potatoes (avoid raw or high-fiber rough vegetables).
   * Soft fruits such as ripe bananas, steamed apples (peeled), or avocados.
2. **Easily absorbed proteins**:
   * Chicken, white fish (steamed or boiled), or boiled eggs.
   * Milk or unsweetened dairy products if tolerated (e.g., plain yogurt).
3. **Healthy fats**:
   * Olive oil, flaxseed oil, or butter (used in moderation to provide energy).
4. **Stay hydrated**:
   * Plain water, diluted fruit juices (like apple or pear), or mild herbal teas such as chamomile.
   * Avoid carbonated drinks, coffee, or alcohol, as they may cause irritation.
5. **Avoid hard-to-digest or irritating foods**:
   * Greasy, fried, or spicy foods.
   * Foods high in insoluble fiber (like cabbage or whole beans) if they cause bloating or abdominal pain.
   * Refined sugar or processed foods.

# Important notes:

* Nutritional needs may vary depending on the patient’s health condition, symptoms (such as diarrhea, constipation, or nausea), and ability to eat. Therefore, it’s best to consult a doctor or nutritionist for a tailored plan.
* If the patient struggles to eat, consider small, frequent meals (4-6 times a day) and prioritize favorite foods to stimulate appetite.

I hated black coffee. I went from zero sugar creamer to Fairlife high protein (increased my weight training).
I was reading several comments and people mentioned to put ice in black coffee & add cinnamon. Thank you because now I can drink it! ♡

I am preparing for my first 36 hour fast this weekend after doing 18:6. 

Any tips? 
I am preparing tea & black coffee Friday morning. I will fast around 4:30p that day!  I am very nervous because I get 'hangry'! 😬 

I hit a plateau so I am ready to implement longer fasts!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the Miami Masters, where the sun shines bright, the tennis balls fly faster than your morning coffee, and the under-20s are ready to prove they can do more than just TikTok dances. Let's dive into the matchups and see where the smart money lies.

First up, Joao Fonseca vs. Learner Tien. Fonseca has been the dominant force in their previous encounters, but Tien has the potential to turn the tables if Fonseca's game goes as sideways as a Floridian alligator on roller skates. Still, Fonseca's track record suggests he might just have the edge here.

Now, let's talk about the match everyone's buzzing about: Thiago Agustin Tirante vs. Flavio Cobolli. Cobolli, ranked No. 43, is the favorite with odds of -190, but Tirante is on a hot streak, winning seven consecutive matches. If you're feeling adventurous and believe in the power of momentum, Tirante's +145 odds might just be your golden ticket. After all, who doesn't love an underdog story, especially when they win 41% of the time in baseball and hockey? Okay, this is tennis, but let's not get bogged down by details.

Cameron Norrie vs. Bu Yunchaokete is another intriguing matchup. Norrie is likely to channel his inner Medvedev, which sounds like a recipe for success, unless Yunchaokete suddenly discovers a secret sauce for non-Asian Swing courts. Spoiler alert: he probably won't.

Finally, Nuno Borges vs. Zizou Bergs. Borges is trying to avoid a third consecutive loss to Bergs. It's like the tennis version of Groundhog Day, but with more sweat and fewer furry animals. If Borges can break the cycle, it might just be the upset of the day.

As for the best bet? I'm leaning towards taking a chance on Tirante at +145. With his current form, it's like betting on a dark horse with a jetpack. And if he loses, well, you can always blame it on the Miami heat or the fact that tennis balls are just too darn bouncy.

So, grab your sunscreen, place your bets, and enjoy the show. Just remember, in tennis, as in life, the ball is always in your court.",1,1742464439.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

Transcript of Audio File Number 0421:

Side One:

\[Clicking noise. The sound of a chair dragging over a bare wooden floor can be heard.\]

Voice 1: My name is doctor Walter Benton. I have been asked to interview the defendant to determine his mental fitness to stand trial for the crimes he has been accused of. Please, state your name for the record. Clearly.

Voice 2: Jack Carmody.

Benton: I need your name as well.

Voice 3: Detective Catherine Robinson.

Benton: It's my understanding that you have chosen not to have a lawyer present, is that correct?

Carmody: Yes. That's correct.

Benton: Okay, that's fine, thank you. Now, I am going to say some words, and I want you to say the first thing that comes to mind.

Carmody: \[Can be heard shifting in his seat slightly.\] Okay, sure.

Benton: Mother.

Carmody: Neglect.

Benton: Blanket.

Carmody: Swaddle.

Benton: Candle.

Carmody: Secret.

Benton: Father.

Carmody: Phantom.

Benton: Dog.

Carmody: Friend.

Benton: I think that will be fine. I am going to ask you some questions now, and if you get uncomfortable, or feel you need a break you can say so at any time. Is that okay, with you, Mister Carmody?

Carmody: I guess so.

Benton: Is that a yes? I need clear affirmative or negative answers.

Carmody: \[Sighing.\] Yes, that was a yes.

Benton: How would you characterize your relationship with your family?

Carmody: Estranged. I haven't spoken with my mother or siblings in almost ten years and I never knew my dad.

Benton: I see. What about your friends and extended family?

Carmody: I don't have many friends, and very rarely do I see the one or two I do have. I'm either working or trying to catch up on things before I return to the drilling rig.

Benton: You said you have one or two friends, how do you get along when you are together?

Carmody: Normally. We joke and bullshit. Oh, sorry. We just talk, maybe go to lunch or dinner.

Benton: You've never gotten violent with them?

Carmody: I'm not a generally violent person.

Benton: What about your siblings, did you ever hit them?

Carmody: No more than any other big brother. We had our spats and a few full on fist fights as we got older, but nothing serious.

\[A phone can be heard ringing in the distance and the detective can be heard having a muffled, one-sided conversation in the background.\]

Robinson: I am needed in my Captain's office, so we need to pause for now because I cannot leave you here unsupervised with the suspect. You'll have to wait out in the lobby until either I or another officer can come sit with you.

\[The tape stops here.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

Benton: Are we ready to resume now?

Robinson: Yes, Doctor.

Carmody: Yes.

Benton: Where were we? Oh, right. You were saying that you and your brothers rarely got physical. Why is it then that you never talk to them?

Carmody: \[Shuffling again, the chains on his handcuffs rattle audibly.\] We have our own reasons. We don't really have much in common besides our mom.

Benton: I want to go back to something you said earlier. You said you never knew your father. Have you ever tried to find him?

Carmody: I asked my mother about him a lot when I was growing up, but she never told me much, so I didn't have much to go on, and never really thought about it.

Benton: It sounds like you relied on your mom a lot. Is that fair to say?

Carmody: I guess so, yeah.

Benton: When did that change?

Carmody: When she brought Steve home, probably.

Benton: Who was Steve?

Carmody: \[Shifting again, obviously uncomfortable.\] My youngest brother's father, and mother's second ex-husband.

Benton: What made him different than the others?

Carmody: A lot of things. For one he was rich. He was also more affectionate than the guy before him. Johnny's father, it's funny, I don't even remember his name.

Benton: How else was he different?

Carmody: I don't want to talk about Steve anymore. Can we change the subject, please?

Benton: Of course. So, after he left, did things go back to normal?

Carmody: Not really, but I wasn't around much longer after that. I moved in with my uncle Pat.

Benton: Did you like living with him?

Carmody: It was decent. He minded his own business as long as I did the same.

Benton: Did you have a lot of contact with your mother and brothers at that time?

Carmody: That's probably the point where we all started drifting apart. I got my first job while I was living with uncle Pat, so I got kind of busy.

Benton: That's understandable. What I don't understand is what the catalyst was.

Carmody: \[Shuffles around again, the rattling of the chains growing louder as they get near the microphone. His tone is strained.\] I'd like to take a break now.

Benton: Okay. I will be back in ten minutes.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

Benton: Are you ready to continue now?

Carmody: \[Subdued.\] Yes, sir.

Benton: I would like to ask you some questions about your work history.

Carmody: That's fine with me.

Benton: You mentioned your first job, where was that?

Carmody: A local hamburger shop. I worked my way up from unloading trucks and mopping the floors to working the fries.

Benton: What about your next job?

Carmody: I worked on the line at a cannery for a while and then kind of went through a series of short-lived menial jobs like that.

Benton: How did you find your current employment?

Carmody: A former co-worker from a seed warehouse I had worked at told me to apply during his time on shore. It took a couple of months but I landed an interview, and a week later, a start date.

Robinson: I'm sorry to interrupt but it's getting late, and I am going to be going home soon. We may have to continue this tomorrow.

Benton: Of course, I'm sorry.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

Benton: This is doctor Walter Benton, conducting day two of Jack Carmody's assessment and interview. I am here with mister Carmody and Detective Robinson.

Benton: Good morning, Mister Carmody, how are you today?

Carmody: I'm fine. A little stiff from sleeping on the bunk, but it will pass. How are you doing?

Benton: I'm fine, thank you. I have a couple of worksheets for you to take back to your cell. \[The sound of papers shuffling can be heard faintly.\] Yesterday we were talking about your work history, do you mind picking up where we left off?

Carmody: Not at all.

Benton: Good. So, I believe you had just told me how you got your most recent job. How did you get along with your co-workers there?

Carmody: Fine, for the most part. There were a few guys who seemed stand-offish at first but over time, we all got to know each other pretty well.

Benton: What about Trevor Durant?

Carmody: Who?

Benton: Trevor Durant. He worked on the same rig you did, but only lasted three months. He filed a complaint the day he quit.

Carmody: A lot of younger guys and girls come and go. I'm terrible with names in general. I really don't remember him.

Benton: Okay, how about Quentin Williams?

Carmody: He didn't like me much when I first started, but after I outlasted a few other new hires he started to treat me better. We even went out for a drink a couple of times.

Benton: Would you say you are friends?

Carmody: No.

Benton: What about Cecilia Perez?

Carmody: The radio operator? We never interacted much.

Benton: You two had no relationship outside of work?

Carmody: Not at all, why?

Benton: I was curious. Next question. How long were you employed?

Carmody: Five years and a few months.

Benton: In that time, you had no incidents involving violence toward one of your colleagues?

Carmody: We had arguments at times but never a physical altercation.

Benton: Were you ever the victim of assault or harassment while performing your duties on the rig?

Carmody: \[Shifts in his seat, the shuffling of fabric and jingling of chains can be heard in the background.\] I don't know what you mean. I got hazed a little bit in the first year or so, but they did the same to other new hires until they eventually stood up for themselves, or quit.

Benton: Okay, I would like to go back to something that we talked about yesterday if we can.

Carmody: What would you like to talk about?

Benton: You mentioned Steven, your step-father.

Carmody: He's not my step-father.

Benton: Sorry. You seemed to equate his appearance in your life with a shift from being able to rely on your mom. Why is that?

Carmody: Our lives started to unravel the day he moved in. He immediately tried to act like my father, and my middle brother's as well. I was just old enough to reject that notion.

Benton: Is that all that caused friction between the two of you?

Carmody: I don't see why that is important, but I will just say no. I would like a break now.

Benton: Okay. I'll give you ten minutes.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

Benton: Do you feel like continuing now?

Carmody: As long as we change the subject, yes.

Benton: Okay. I understand. Let's talk about your time in school a little bit.

Carmody: There's not much to tell. I got decent grades, and even joined a couple of clubs.

Benton: Did you ever have any trouble with bullies?

Carmody: For a while when I first got into high school.

Benton: How did that issue get resolved?

Carmody: I stood up to one of them.

Benton: Can you elaborate a little bit on that?

Carmody: I cornered one of the crueler bullies in the boy's shower and beat him with a hockey stick.

Benton: What happened after that?

Carmody: That was the first time I got arrested, ended up spending a few months in a boy's home, doing weekly schoolwork packets.

Benton: Other than that, did you ever have any violent incidents in school?

Carmody: Not as the aggressor.

Benton: Okay. I would like to move on, then. When did you meet Devon Trainer?

Carmody: When he started working on the rig. I think it was June of 2019.

Benton: How did you get along with him?

Carmody: Normally, I would say. I teased him a bit, but nothing mean-spirited or malicious. Some of the others weren't so nice.

Benton: Elaborate, please?

Carmody: I'm not sure who did it, but someone tossed his off-duty shoes over the rail and into the ocean. Someone else tampered with his food, adding a 'secret ingredient'.

Benton: How did he react?

Carmody: He didn't really react at all, just did his job, and came back for his next shift with a new pair of shoes. Never said a word about the food, either.

Benton: Are you aware that he attacked one of your co-workers in a nightclub?

Carmody: I heard something about it when I came back to shore after it happened. I was just as surprised as everyone else.

Benton: Did you have any contact with Devon before he was apprehended?

Carmody: No. None.

Benton: Did you know another of your co-workers was also attacked a week before you were arrested?

Carmody: You mean Trevor? I saw the newspaper article about it after I was already in county jail.

Benton: You know nothing about who did it?

Carmody: Nothing at all.

Benton: Can you tell me how you felt on the day that led to your arrest?

Carmody: I felt normal when I got on the boat, I would even go so far as to say I had been in a good mood as I told the detectives.

Robinson: Excuse me, but I thought this was to determine his fitness for trial. I've been sitting here for nearly a day and a half, and all you've done is ask questions you already know the answer to.

Benton: May I speak with you outside?

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

Benton: I apologize for the interruption. I have been asked to speed this up a little bit, so I need to ask you some more questions.

Carmody: Honestly, I am a little tired of this whole thing. I don't see the point.

Benton: We can just stop for the day. I would love to see you tomorrow so that I can finish this up.

Carmody: Fine.

Benton: Please don't forget to fill out your worksheets.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

Benton: This is Doctor Walter Benton conducting day three of Jack Carmody's assessment and interview. I am here with Jack Carmody and Detective Robinson.

Benton: Good morning again, Mr. Carmody. How are you today?

Carmody: Tired. I could barely sleep last night, but I did fill out those papers you gave me.

\[Shuffling and movement can be heard along with the jingling of Carmody's restraints. The scraping ov chairs over the floor, and someone can be heard coughing.\]

Benton: I appreciate that. I'm sorry you didn't sleep well. I would like to try a word association game again.

Carmody: I will do my best to answer quickly.

Benton: I appreciate that as well, now, if you're ready, we will begin.

Benton: Brother.

Carmody: Regret.

Benton: Balloon.

Carmody: Circus.

Benton: Touch.

Carmody: Avoid.

Benton: Drill.

Carmody: \[Jingling can be heard and there is a rather long pause, as if he is thinking.\] Darkness.

Benton: Water.

Carmody: Drown.

Benton: Blade.

Carmody: \[Another pause.\] Tool.

Benton: Why did you hesitate?

Carmody: I told you I didn't sleep well. Sorry if I'm still a little foggy.

Benton: Fine, we'll continue.

Benton: Fish.

Carmody: Food.

Benton: Cat.

Carmody: Sneaky.

Benton: I think that concludes round two. I have another list, but we can get back to that after we take a little break to use the facilities and get a fresh coffee. Detective, may I speak with you outside?

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

Benton: Are you feeling a little more awake now, Mister Carmody?

Carmody: A little bit, yeah. \[The sound of a cardboard cup being set on the table near the microphone.\]

Benton: I know you don't want to talk about your step-father...

Carmody: He's not my step-father. They got divorced.

Benton: I apologize.

Carmody: That's the third or fourth time that you have made that mistake, which makes me believe you're trying to get a reaction out of me. Is that the purpose of this whole interview? To make me look like a lunatic by repeatedly pressing a button you were warned about?

Benton: \[There is a long pause. The doctor sighs.\] No. But uncomfortable subjects are often where we get the best information. I am going to have to ask for a minute to turn the tape over, we've almost run out.

Since he started there are a couple of kids - twins one boy, one girl- same age as him that hit him and everyone else all the time. They also throw massive tantrums and scream when we have events in the nursery with parents and kids - like halloween, mother’s day, etc. Their behaviour clearly stands out.
I am friends with their mum and I feel sorry for her. We occasionally have coffee after drop off and she always shares how hard it it to deal with their challenging behaviour. 
I am no specialist, but it looks to me the kids are normal, but a bit more savage at this age than most.
My kid is always telling me how the twins beat him and specifically the boy hits him on his head. He says that he hits strong and that it hurts. I always say to my kid - Don’t hit back but defend yourself. You can hold his hands and say- don’t hit me, and call the carer. 
Yesterday, however, there was an incident and I an upset. Apparently it was an accident. They were running the playground and this boy hit his head on my kids chin and one of his front teeth became loose. Lots of blood. The tooth is still loose still bleeding a bit. The gum looks terrible. 
Coincidentally, the twins’ mom is a dentist and she examined my kid a couple of hours after the accident. She said it seems there is no broken bones and the tooth will probably stop moving and reattach itself. But it is a long recovery. Meanwhile, he can’t eat anything solid and needs to stay calm and still to prevent further accidents- and losing the tooth. It has been very hard because he is full of energy and wants to jump, tun and play. We are taking him to an appointment today because it is still bleeding and it was advised we should look at it.

On a different note, my kid tells me that me he wants all the pre-schoolers in his birthday party- except the twins. When I ask him why he says - it is because cause they hit me, they hit me on the head and it hurts. 
It is a small nursery, and I really like the mom, so I invited the twins for my son’s little birthday celebration. But I am a bit skeptical
I am not sure what to do. I am feeling very frustrated and sad. It will not be good if my son loses one of his front teeth at 3 years old.
Should I address the nursery about the kids’ behaviour? They clearly know about. I know that kids get hurt but losing a tooth seems a bit extreme. ",0,1742464038.0,UKParenting,2,0.25,False

I read a poem today that truly captivated my soul. The words resonating in my mind as I envision your coffee hued eyes. I hope this poem touches your heart as much as it did mine.
Lethal Eyes by Bleeding in Silence
"" Your eyes. 
What a cruel kind of beautiful. 
The kind that Autumn envies.
 They remind me of golden leaves caught in the wind.
 Of old books with stories aching to be told.
Of the way coffee tastes in silence.
I see them.
A fire that never dies.
A beauty that burns.
Swallowing the ashes of those who dare to look.
If I could, I would gather their shade, pour it into the sky, and let the world see what I see.
How breathtakingly endless they are.
So have mercy, for these eyes of yours are lethal.
They steal the breath I do not mind losing.
Pull me into a world I never wish to leave.
And every time you look my way.
I swear.
I fall all over again.""

Until next time,
Your kindhearted Druid 💚",2,1742463987.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False

Something easy, quick, and preferably well-paying. No complicated interviews, no weeks of waiting for a paycheck—just instant cash.

That’s when I stumbled upon the ad.

**""WANTED: Babysitter for one night. Pays $500. Must follow instructions carefully.""**

Five hundred dollars for a single night? That was insane. Too good to be true, really. Babysitting usually paid, what, fifteen bucks an hour at best? My first instinct told me there had to be a catch. Maybe it was a prank. Maybe it was some kind of scam. But then I thought about my empty fridge, my overdue internet bill, and the fact that I had about twenty dollars to my name. I wasn’t in a position to be picky.

Without overthinking it, I grabbed my phone and dialed the number listed in the ad.

The phone barely rang twice before someone picked up. A woman. Her voice was cold, distant—completely void of warmth, like she was reading off a script.

**“Be here by 7 PM sharp. No guests. No phone calls.” She said,**

I opened my mouth to respond, to ask any of the hundred questions running through my mind, but the line went dead before I could get a single word out. No introduction, no small talk, nothing. Just an address and a set of rules.

That should have been my first red flag. Who hires a total stranger without even asking basic questions? No ""Do you have experience?"" No ""Have you worked with kids before?"" Just… instructions. But five hundred bucks for a few hours of babysitting? No way was I passing that up.

I drove to the house and arrived.

The house was massive. Not just big—**mansion** big. It stood at the very end of a long, deserted road, surrounded by nothing but empty land and thick, shadowy trees. No neighbors. No streetlights. Just a cracked, lonely pavement leading up to an eerie, towering house.

A single porch light flickered weakly, barely illuminating the front door. The whole place looked straight out of one of those horror movies I usually avoided. Something about it made me hesitate. The silence. The stillness. The way the windows loomed like dark, empty eyes.

I took a breath, shaking off the creeping unease, and walked up the steps. My knuckles barely brushed against the wood when the door creaked open—like someone had been standing behind it, waiting for me.

A man stood in the doorway. He was tall, painfully thin, with sharp features that made his hollowed-out face look even more severe. Deep, dark circles pooled under his sunken eyes, like he hadn’t slept in weeks. Maybe months. Despite his exhaustion, his suit was crisp, perfectly pressed, not a wrinkle in sight.

Behind him, a woman hovered stiffly, her posture so rigid she looked like she might shatter. Her hands were clasped tightly in front of her, knuckles bone-white, like she was holding onto something for dear life.

The man’s gaze locked onto mine. His voice was flat. Mechanical.

**""You’re the babysitter?""**

I swallowed, my throat suddenly dry. “Yeah.”

The woman stepped forward before I could say anything else and shoved a folded piece of paper into my hand.

**""These are the instructions.""**

I glanced down at it but didn’t open it yet. Something about their urgency made my stomach twist. **“So, um… where’s the kid?”** I asked, forcing a small smile.

Neither of them answered. The woman didn’t even blink. She just turned on her heel, grabbed her coat, and started toward the door.

**""We’ll be back by sunrise,""** she said quickly. **""Follow the rules, and you’ll be fine.""**

And then—before I could ask anything else—they were gone. The door shut behind them with a quiet but firm **click.**

I stood there for a long moment, gripping the piece of paper in my hand, my unease growing by the second. Why had they left so quickly? Why did this whole thing feel… wrong?

Finally, I looked down at the list.

The paper was old, slightly crumpled, and covered in tight, neat handwriting, each letter carefully formed, as if someone had taken painstaking effort to make sure every word was clear. It wasn’t printed, no official babysitting instructions—just a handwritten list. It wasn’t rushed or scribbled—it was deliberate. Like whoever wrote it **needed** me to understand.

My eyes skimmed over the rules, my stomach twisting with each one.

**Rule #1 : Put Timmy to bed by 8:30 PM. If he asks for a bedtime story, only read from the green book on his shelf. Do not read any other book aloud.**

Okay… strict, but fine. Maybe it was a sentimental book or something.

**Rule #2 : Lock all doors and windows before 9 PM. If you hear scratching at the back door, do NOT investigate.**

I blinked. What? That was weird. Why would there be scratching? A raccoon? A stray cat?

**Rule #3 : Do not answer the phone after 11 PM.**

My pulse quickened. Why? Who would be calling? And why would I need to ignore it?

**Rule #4 : If Timmy tells you someone is outside his window, do NOT look. Tell him, “Go to sleep, Timmy.” Do not say anything else.**

Okay. No. That was officially creepy.

**Rule #5 : If you hear footsteps upstairs while Timmy is asleep, ignore them. Whatever you do, do NOT go upstairs.**

A lump formed in my throat. Footsteps? But there shouldn’t be anyone else in the house.

**Rule #6 : At 11:33 PM, the kitchen door will open on its own. Do NOT close it. Do not look inside. Let it remain open until 11:42 PM.**

My hands felt clammy. I wiped them on my jeans.

**Rule #7 : If you hear a child giggling from the second floor, ignore it. The boy you are babysitting is asleep.**

I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the top of the list, rereading every rule, hoping maybe I had misunderstood something. But the words were still there, clear as day.

**Rule #8 : If you wake up on the couch and don’t remember falling asleep, leave the house immediately. Do not look back.**

I let out a nervous laugh. A dry, humorless sound. This had to be a joke, right? A prank? Maybe the parents were just messing with me—some weird rich people humor I didn’t understand.

Then, I heard a voice.

**“Are you my new babysitter?”**

I jumped, my heart slamming into my ribs as I spun around.

A little boy stood at the bottom of the staircase, staring at me with wide, tired eyes. He couldn’t have been older than six. His blond hair was messy, sticking up in different directions like he’d been tossing and turning in bed. He wore pajamas—soft, blue ones covered in tiny stars.

I forced a smile, trying to steady my breathing. **“Yeah. You must be Timmy.”**

He nodded. **“Did my mom give you the rules?” He asked.**

Something about the way he asked sent a chill up my spine. His tone wasn’t casual or curious. It was serious.

My stomach twisted. **“Uh… yeah.”**

His expression darkened. His small fingers tightened on the banister. **“You have to follow them.”**

I stared at him, unable to respond. His voice was quiet, but there was a weight behind it—something heavy, something that made my skin crawl.

I shook off the unease, forcing myself to focus. It was just a kid. Just a weird set of rules. Nothing was going to happen.

I led Timmy upstairs, my footsteps echoing in the quiet house. His room was small and tidy, with a little twin bed and a row of stuffed animals lined up against the wall. Everything was neatly arranged, like it hadn’t been touched in a while.

As I pulled the blanket over him, he whispered, **“Don’t forget to lock the doors and windows.”**

I nodded quickly, not wanting to show my discomfort. **“I won’t. Get some sleep, okay?”**

He didn’t answer, He studied my face for a moment, like he was trying to decide if he could trust me. Then, finally, just turned over, hugging a stuffed bear to his chest, and he closed his eyes.

As soon as his breathing evened out, I left the room and made my way through the house, double-checking every door, every window. The locks clicked into place, one by one, until I was sure everything was secure.

I had just finished locking the back door when I heard it.

A faint scratching.

I froze.

The sound was soft but deliberate. A slow, dragging scrape, like fingernails running over the wood. My breath caught in my throat.

A cold chill ran down my spine as my eyes flicked toward the paper still clutched in my hand.

Rule #2: **If you hear scratching at the back door, do NOT investigate.**

My throat tightened. Every instinct screamed at me to look—to check, just to make sure it wasn’t, I don’t know, a tree branch or an animal. But something deep inside me **knew** better.

I squeezed my eyes shut, my pulse hammering in my ears. **Just walk away. Ignore it. It’s nothing.**

Slowly, I forced my legs to move, stepping away from the door. The scratching continued behind me, steady and patient, as if whatever was out there **knew** I was listening.

Minutes passed. The scratching continued, slow and rhythmic, until, finally—it stopped.

I let out a shaky breath.

I spent the next hour glued to my phone, scrolling through social media mindlessly, trying to drown out the silence. But the quiet was suffocating. The whole house felt… wrong. Too still, too heavy, like the walls themselves were holding their breath. Every creak, every shift in the floorboards made my heart pound.

I forced myself to check the clock.

Then, at exactly 11 PM, the house phone rang.

I froze.

I jolted so hard my phone nearly slipped from my hands. The old landline sat on the wall near the kitchen. Its shrill, piercing ring shattered the silence, echoing through the dimly lit living room, sharp and unrelenting. My breath hitched.

Rule #3: **Do not answer the phone after 11 PM.**

I turned my head slowly, my gaze landing on the old-fashioned phone sitting on the small table across the room. 

I stared at it, my pulse pounding in my ears. The ringing didn’t stop. It just kept going, over and over, like whoever was on the other end wasn’t going to give up.

The ringing was insistent, demanding. 

Like It knew I was here.

It rang again.

And again.

And again.

I turned my back to it, gripping my phone in my hands, trying to ignore it. Just a few more seconds, and it would stop. 

Each ring made my stomach clench tighter. 

My fingers twitched. My breathing came fast and shallow.

What would happen if I answered? Who would be on the other end?

I squeezed my hands into fists, my nails digging into my palms. **Ignore it. Just ignore it.**

Seconds dragged on like hours. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the ringing cut off.

Silence.

I let out a slow breath, forcing myself to relax.

But just as my shoulders sagged—

**“Miss?”**

My stomach plummeted.

I spun around so fast my vision blurred.

Timmy stood at the bottom of the staircase. His small hands gripped the railing tightly, his knuckles white, his eyes wide with fear. His face was pale, his lower lip trembling. When he spoke again, his voice was barely above a whisper.

**“There’s someone outside my window.”**

My blood ran cold.

**Rule #4** flashed in my mind.

**If Timmy tells you someone is outside his window, do NOT look. Tell him, “Go to sleep, Timmy.” Do not say anything else.**

I swallowed hard, forcing myself to keep my voice steady. **“It’s okay, Timmy. Go to sleep.”**

Timmy didn’t move right away. His small fingers gripped the banister, knuckles turning pale. His lip quivered as he shifted on his feet. **“But… he’s staring at me.”**

A chill spread through my body, icy and slow. My instincts screamed at me to run upstairs, to check, to **look**—but I knew I couldn’t. The rules were clear.

I forced a weak smile, even though my hands were shaking. **“Go to sleep, Timmy.”**

His wide eyes flicked toward the hallway, and for a second, I thought he was going to argue. His little body trembled, a quiet fear radiating from him like static electricity.

But then, slowly, he nodded.

Without another word, he turned and padded back toward his room. He climbed into bed, pulling the covers up to his chin.

Then—Timmy asked suddenly.

**“Are you scared?”** 

My breath caught.

I turned my head slowly, my heart hammering in my ears.

Timmy was still sitting upright in bed. He shouldn’t have been—I had just tucked him in, just watched him lay down. But there he was, sitting silently, watching me.

His pale face seemed even paler under the dim glow of his nightlight. He was small for his age, fragile-looking, with dark circles under his eyes.

I forced out a short, nervous chuckle. **“Of what?”**

Timmy didn’t blink.

**He didn’t answer.**

Instead, in a quiet, almost pleading voice, he whispered: **“Don’t close the kitchen door.”**

A cold, twisting fear coiled in my stomach.

I pressed my lips together and nodded. **“Okay.”**

I left his room and shut the door behind me—firm, but gentle, careful not to make a sound. I could still feel his gaze, burning into my back.

I didn’t check the window. I **couldn’t** check the window.

My legs carried me downstairs on autopilot, though every step felt heavier, harder to take. I tried to shake off the nerves, tried to convince myself this was all in my head.

I was trying to calm the wild pounding in my chest. Just make it through the night.

The rules were just… just **weird rules**, right? The parents were strict. Maybe paranoid. Maybe they had a reason for all of this.

Maybe I was just overthinking.

I settled onto the couch, wrapping a blanket around myself, my hands clenched tight in the fabric.

I glanced at the clock.

**11:32 PM.**

My stomach twisted.

My fingers gripped the blanket tighter.

And then—

**11:33 PM.**

A long, low creak echoed through the house.

My body went rigid.

The kitchen door **swung open.**

I didn’t move. I didn’t even breathe.

A deep, suffocating darkness seeped out from the doorway, **too dark**, stretching like ink bleeding into the air. The doorway itself looked… wrong, somehow. Like it was pulling further away, stretching longer than it should have been.

I squeezed my eyes shut. **Don’t look inside. Let it remain open until 11:42 PM.**

I fumbled for my phone with shaking fingers. The screen glowed in the darkness.

**Seven minutes left.**

That was all. Seven minutes. Just wait. Just sit still.

Then—From the darkness, I heard breathing.

Not mine.

Not Timmy’s.

Something **else**.

It was deep and slow, a wet, rasping inhale, followed by an even slower exhale.

I pressed my back against the couch, my nails digging into my palms. My whole body was tense, every muscle locked in place.

The breathing got louder. Closer. So close, I could almost **feel** it against my skin.

A shudder crawled up my spine.

My phone screen flickered.

**11:41 PM.**

Almost there. Just one more minute.

The breath hitched—like it was shifting, moving.

The clock finally struck **11:42 PM.**

The sound stopped.

I opened my eyes and looked..

The kitchen door was closed.

My chest heaved as I sucked in a shaky breath. My lungs burned, like I’d been holding it in for too long. My fingers, still clenched into fists, slowly unfurled, the movement stiff and reluctant. When I glanced down, my palms were marked with deep, crescent-shaped indentations where my nails had dug in too deep. A sharp sting ran through them, but I barely registered the pain.

It was over.

For now.

I checked the time again. **11:43 PM.**

The house was silent, but not in a peaceful way. It wasn’t the kind of quiet that brought relief. It was the kind that pressed down on you, thick and suffocating, like something unseen was still there, lurking just beyond sight. Watching. Waiting.

I stayed on the couch, refusing to move. My body was still coiled tight, my muscles aching from the tension. I tried to focus on my breathing, to slow my racing pulse, to convince myself that everything was fine.

But my heart barely had time to slow before I heard—A child’s giggle.

The sound came from **upstairs**.

I went completely still.

My eyes darted to the baby monitor on the coffee table. The small screen showed Timmy’s bed. He was there. Asleep. Not moving.

The giggling got louder.

It wasn’t him.

My throat tightened.

Rule #6: **If you hear a child giggling from the second floor, ignore it. The boy you are babysitting is asleep.**

I clenched my hands into fists, nails biting into my skin. **Ignore it. Just ignore it.**

The giggling stopped.

For a moment, the house was silent again.

Then—

From behind the couch.

A whisper Came.

**“You’re no fun.”**

A cold rush of terror flooded my veins.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. I stayed perfectly still, my body locked in place, waiting.

The silence stretched on.

I sat there, frozen, until the house felt normal again.

I exhaled shakily, barely realizing I’d been holding my breath. My chest ached, my muscles weak from how tense I had been. I forced myself to check the clock.

My body sagging in relief. My heart was hammering so hard it hurt. 

**See? Nothing happened. I followed the rules, and nothing happened.**

**Everything was fine—**

And then—I heard Soft footsteps. Upstairs.

I went rigid.

I was on the couch. Timmy was asleep in his room. I had checked. I had seen him.

But, I could hear them.

Slow. Deliberate. Measured steps pressing against the wooden floor above me, moving with an eerie patience.

I gripped the armrest, my fingers digging into the fabric.

**Rule #5: If you hear footsteps upstairs while Timmy is asleep, ignore them. Do NOT go upstairs.**

I squeezed my eyes shut, breathing through my nose. **Ignore it.** It’s just noise. Just a house settling. 

I clamped a hand over my mouth, choking back the instinct to scream.

**Ignore it. Just ignore it.**

I squeezed my eyes shut, pressing my back harder into the couch, as if that would somehow shield me from whatever was up there. My whole body trembled, a cold sweat slicking my skin. The footsteps didn’t stop. They moved again—slow, deliberate. Pacing. Back and forth. Just above me.

My mind raced.

**Who… or what… was up there?**

No.

It didn’t matter.

I wasn’t going to find out.

A floorboard creaked.

The steps were moving—down the hall.

Toward Timmy’s room.

A sharp, icy panic tore through my chest. I wanted to run, to throw open his door and grab him, but I couldn’t. **The rules. Follow the rules.**

Then, I heard A whisper.

**""Miss? Why didn’t you listen?”**

A shudder rippled through me. My vision blurred. My chest ached, like the air was too thick, too heavy.

My fingers trembled as I rubbed my eyes. My breath came in short, ragged gasps.

I kept my eyes shut tight, forcing myself to block out the sound. **Don’t react. Don’t acknowledge it.** Seconds dragged into minutes, each one stretching unbearably long. 

And, Then—The footsteps stopped.

Silence.

Darkness swallowed me whole.

The dizziness hit me hard, like something had sucked all the energy from my body in an instant. 

For a moment—maybe longer—I was weightless, drifting in a void of nothingness. There was no sound, no sensation. Just an endless, suffocating emptiness. My mind felt disconnected from my body, like I was floating in a dream. Or maybe a nightmare.

My head swam. My limbs felt weak.

And then—I collapsed.

The world faded to black.

I don’t remember dreaming. I don’t remember anything at all.

I must have dozed off because the next thing I knew, I was waking up—

In Timmy’s bed.

My entire body turned to ice.

The sheets beneath me were soft. The air smelled faintly of dust and something… stale. Wrong.

I bolted upright, my pulse slamming against my ribs. **No, no, no—**

**Rule #7: If you wake up somewhere other than the couch, immediately leave the house without looking behind you.**

I sat up, frozen, my breath coming in sharp, panicked gulps.

The air around me felt thick, heavy, pressing down on my shoulders. I couldn’t hear anything—no wind, no cars outside. Just a deep, swallowing silence.

The mattress dipped.

Suddenly, From the darkness behind me, a voice whispered.

**“Emily… where are you going?”**

Something was in bed with me.

A cold sweat broke across my skin.

I did not turn around.

I forced my body to move, inch by inch. My hands trembled as I pushed the blanket off. My feet touched the cold floor.

Behind me, the presence shifted.

I bit the inside of my cheek so hard I tasted blood. **Don’t run. Don’t panic.**

And, My decision was already made.

I was leaving.

Not just this house. Not just this job.

This **town**.

I packed what little I had, stuffing my bag with trembling hands. No goodbyes. No explanations. **I didn’t want to explain.**

Because I didn’t understand.

And worse—I didn’t want to.

I stood.

I walked forward. I kept my head down as I stepped outside. 

The floor creaked under my steps.

Behind me—footsteps followed.

Soft. Slow. Playful.

I reached the hallway.

The footsteps quickened.

A breath—cold and damp—brushed the back of my neck.

**I ran.**

I hit the stairs, skipping steps, my legs burning as I pushed forward.

The footsteps behind me pounded faster, matching my speed.

I reached the front door, my fingers scrambling over the lock. My hands shook so badly I nearly dropped my keys.

I yanked the door open.

The cold night air hit me like a wave.

I sprinted outside, my heart slamming against my ribs.

I didn’t stop.

Not until I reached my car.

Only then did I turn back, gasping for breath, my hands still shaking.

The house was dark.

The front door—still wide open.

Something stood in the doorway.

Watching.

Waiting.

I didn’t stay to find out what.

The next morning, as I looked at my purse, I noticed Timmy's bear inside my bag. I had to return it, no matter what. I couldn’t keep it.

My hands still trembled as I dialed the number from the babysitting ad.

It rang once.

Twice.

Then—someone picked up.

A man’s voice. Not the father’s. **Not the mother’s.**

**“This is Officer Daniels.”**

I hesitated. **“Uh… I was trying to reach the family that lives at—”** I gave him the address, my voice unsteady.

Silence.

Then, in a careful, measured voice, the officer asked, **“Who are you trying to reach?”**

I told him the couple’s names.

Another long pause.

A cold, sinking dread settled in my stomach.

Then, finally, the officer spoke.

His voice was quiet. Cautious.

**“…That house has been abandoned for twenty years.”**

My mouth went dry.

**“No,”** I whispered. **“I was there. I babysat their son.”**

The line was silent for so long that I thought we had been disconnected.

Then, the officer exhaled. A slow, careful breath.

**“There was a little boy that lived there once.”**

I gripped my phone tighter. My heart pounded so hard it hurt.

The officer’s voice was barely above a whisper.

**“But he died in 2003.”**

The call cut off.

I stared at my phone, my chest rising and falling too fast.

Then—

I felt it.

A shift in the air.

The tiny, creeping sensation of being **watched**.

Slowly, stiffly, I turned my head.

I looked at the bear. It wasn’t the same anymore.

And I swear—**I saw it smiling at me**.",2,1742463839.0,nosleep,0,0.75,False

I am most likely going to transfer both my small Philodendron Splendid and Anthurium Warocqueanum to a similar setting with self-watering pots. A quick Google search keeps warning me regarding pure moss settings not having enough aeration and support and that it should be mixed with another substrate. 

Question 1- I have large volumes of both LECA and perlite, which I can mix with sphagnum moss, but I was wondering if anyone has tried a similar setting and what your experiences were with it.


Question 2- Since Philodendron Splendid is a high climber, would the moisture be carried all the way up the top? If not, would a set-up a wick system like the photo attached on the post work? If necessary I would need to put plastic cups with a hole underneath on the top of the poles for the hydration of the top bits but they do look ugly.

Just wanted to give my experience since I browsed through tens of threads both on reddit and xda, and didn't find one comprehensive answer. So this might be helpful. Bear in mind this is not a step-by step tutorial, and more like story-based approach. The detailed generic steps are already abundant in other threads and forums, also youtube.

  
THE USUAL DISCLAIMER: 

*  **I'm not responsible for bricked devices, thermonuclear war or alarm app fails.**
*  **If it's your first time or you're unexperienced with these kind of stuffs, please do some search before flashing!** 
* **YOU are choosing to make these modifications, you're the only responsible guy for messing up if you do so.**

  
Okay let's begin.

I own S911B with OLE - XID CSC. I didn't know much about recent updates to Samsung flashing and stuffs, since the last time I played with Android is the first Galaxy Tab 7 inch, and Oneplus One. 10+ years ago. I have much to learn nowadays.

So, the dumb me decided to just jump into ADB and flash the update.zip. Error. E2004 prism partition failed something something. After I searched into this issue, it's because my main CSC is OLE, and it needs to be OXM (international). I search far and wide and haven't found anything regarding changing main CSC so I decided to just try it myself.

I downloaded the official OXM - EUX CSC firmware from samfw with correct build for the beta update. It's a pretty big file so take your time, I think the site implement throttling since I don't utilise my whole bandwidth. At the time I'm writing, there's one newer build, and just to be safe download the correct one. I haven't tried what will happen if I use the newer build and won't try. The probable result is it'll fail.

How about the backup? Actually this method didn't wipe the data at all. But just to be safe I backed up with samsung switch. Whatsapp, google photos, etc already backed up automatically via respective apps. Please make sure what you need yourself since everyone will have different cases. 

Next, I flashed the official OXM firmware with HOME\_CSC using Odin. You can find the link to Odin in sammobile or other sites. Press the button, and then put the correct file. Boot into download mode, click start, do some pushups or make coffee or whatever, and voila. PASS and good reboot with files intact is the endgame. Detailed tutorial is in YT. Also please use laptop if the electricity is unstable, or historically unstable. You don't want blackout mid update.

Finally, use adb to sideload the update.zip and here we go. Files and apps intact. ONE UI 7 :)

I have an important exam coming up, and I’m wondering what would be the best way to maximize mental performance in the 3–5 days leading up to it while staying keto.

My current idea:
	•	Go carnivore for 3 days before the exam to simplify digestion and boost mental clarity.
	•	On exam day, reintroduce some carbs (maybe berries or honey?) to see if it gives a cognitive boost.
	•	Reduce coffee 2 days prior, then take it back on exam day for an extra kick.

I’m in my early 20s, originally from Anuradhapura but currently living in Colombo. Since I’m doing an external degree in ucsc, I don’t have the typical university experience or a big friend circle here. So, I’m hoping to connect with like-minded people around my age who are also looking to make good friends.

If you have a solid friend group or a social circle, how’s your experience been? Do you have fun meetups or hangouts? I’d love to join in or even build a new group!

I’m interested in going to events like book fairs, exhibitions, musicals, and public events at BMICH—basically anything fun and engaging. I also enjoy casual meetups over coffee, exploring new places, and having good conversations. And if you would like we can do some street photography things because I'm interested in that.

If you're in your 20s and looking for a good group to hang out with, hit me up! Let’s make some great memories together. And I would love to join with you guys! ",1,1742462574.0,srilanka,5,0.6,False

I get plenty of matches, like literally 100s, non of them respond. Got ghosted by 4 guys trying to set up a coffee date with each of them in the past two weeks. I’m very sensitive to rejection honestly and it kills me every time.

And so Grindr right, but I can’t physically get myself to hookup with someone, how do you go to someone’s house who you don’t even know and do the most intimate and comprising thing possible and then just leave? like it doesn’t make any logical sense to me. But I guess I need to learn how to do it because this isolation is killing me, I just want to be held. The fact that I’ve wasted so much of my youth already. I have been suicidal for most of my life and the past few years have been absolute hell, I thought I’d come out, go on a few dates and be fucking and just living a normal life by now. I need something soon or I don’t know what I’m going to do, I feel like I’m stuck behind glass or something.

I know this is largely an online dating problem not just a gay problem but I live in a small city, there’s not really anywhere I can meet gay guys in person. I guess I need to travel or move… if I had the cash. ",0,1742462567.0,askgaybros,1,0.5,False

While manual brewing methods like pour-over and French press offer control over the brewing process, a high-quality coffee dripper machine can provide consistency and ease, especially for busy mornings.

When considering the best coffee dripper machine, there are several factors to keep in mind, including brewing temperature, water distribution, and overall durability. Some top options across different price ranges include:

* **Budget-Friendly ($50 and under):** While affordable coffee makers often lack precise temperature control, brands like Mr. Coffee and Hamilton Beach offer reliable entry-level options for those looking for an inexpensive upgrade.
* **Mid-Range ($100-$200):** Machines like the **Bonavita Connoisseur** and **OXO Brew 9-Cup Coffee Maker** stand out for their ability to maintain optimal brewing temperatures (195-205°F) and even water distribution, which enhances flavor extraction.
* **High-End ($200+):** The **Technivorm Moccamaster** is a premium choice praised for its handcrafted design, durability, and exceptional brewing precision. It heats water quickly and ensures even saturation of coffee grounds, delivering a rich and well-balanced cup.

For those who want added programmability, the **Ninja CE251 Programmable Brewer** is a great choice, offering customizable brewing strength and a built-in warming plate.

Ultimately, the best coffee dripper machine depends on your budget and preferences. If you prioritize temperature stability and long-term reliability, investing in a high-end model like the Moccamaster is worthwhile. However, if you’re looking for a great balance between price and performance, the Bonavita or OXO Brew are excellent mid-range options.

Is it normal for your boyfriend to like be close with other girls you've known for a while.

We're the same age btw. Basically he's always like had a big friend group and I've been friends with him and his friends for a while  and he has female friends I've male friends we don't mind.

So recently my boyfriend had an argument over call with his parents and it just put him in a foul mood. So he decided to not tell me which is fine he knows I'm going through something myself. However he told one of my best friends (we'll call her M) who's his friend too and I literally wasn't aware until last night I got thirsty but I didn't have water in the room I share with three other girls including M. So like I wake up and look around but M isn't in bed. But fine she probably went to the bathroom or something. I leave the room to go to the lounge room in our campus which basically had water, tea, coffee, biscuits a fireplace a couch, a bookshelf all that. So when I leave I see J and my boyfriend hugging and he's just sobbing into her shoulder while she strokes his hair. I get friends but that just seemed way too close for me, they didn't notice me so I left and went to get my water. When I returned he wasn't there and she was back in bed sleeping.

We like to find a new cafe to try and somewhere for a stoat, and yesterday was no exception.

The premise was simple. Use the Zoe (which doesn't have rapid charge) and do a 160ish mile round trip to see how it goes.

The target was easily selected : a Cafe called Drift near North Berwick has an all day breakfast with Stornoway black pudding.  There's also a nice set of beaches for a stoat!

Car was all warmed up and good to go for 9.45am, pretty much ideal timing for our 1130am booking.

Yes, we expected to do 80 miles in about 1h 45 mins. For those who don't know, the route included the triple threat of :

Hermiston Gait

The Edinburgh City Bypass 

And Sheriffhall Roundabout.

A more carnaptious trio of Ill advised traffic infrastructure it is hard to fathom.

Regardless, miles pootled by ok, and we arrived about 15 mins early for scran.

The vista from said cafe was magnificent!A great breakfast was had.

We had some more coffee and some cake before heading into North Berwick for a walk.

 
The intention was simple - park up at a 22kw charger, have a stoat, 

First charger: capped at 2kW!, no thanks..

Second charger?
Huzzah! 

Parked up with 49% showing.

I helped the couple in the car on the right set it up for a charge (it was a PHEV, and their first time charging it away from home).

Got them sorted, so that was good. However, it meant the 22kw was shared between the cars, so despite being plugged in for 75mins, it only added 22% (10kWh) to the Zoe.

That was fine though!

Whilst charging we went for a stoat round North Berwick -it really was a glorious day to be out!

The run back home was all good, made decent time, and it proved that both the Burd and I were able to be comfortable in the car for longish stints..

Scores on the doors when we got home as per photo.

41kwh used for 159.3miles means it did 3.88m/kWh so a theoretical range of 194miles if we had not charged and ran it til pretty much dead.

In reality, if we hadn't charged, we'd have got home with about 9/10% remaining. Perfectly good for the low temps and mainly motorway/dual carriageway driving.

The recuperated energy level is low, cos we spent ages on cruise rattling along, very few opportunities to regen.

It's on charge now, and should be done by 9.30am.

That's handy as we are off to the Lake District today🤣 (should be 300 miles or so over 2 days)

You ever just sit there, drowning in a sea of pending essays, unfinished flashcards, and an untouched past-paper folder… but instead of doing anything, you scroll? And scroll. And suddenly it’s 2 AM, your guilt is screaming, but your motivation is nowhere to be found?  

Yeah, that’s me. Every. Single. Day.  

At this point, I’m convinced A-Levels aren't just about studying—they’re about the art of controlled procrastination. One minute, I’m trying to do a single question from a past paper. The next? I’m deep into some random conspiracy theory about how pigeons are government spies. And don’t even get me started on the ""I'll start at 5:00 sharp"" mindset, only to see it's 5:02, so now I *have* to wait till 6:00.   

And then there’s the balance—trying to be a good student while also maintaining friendships, family, and maybe even a relationship (if you’re brave). One second, I’m typing ""sorry, I can't come, I have to study,"" and the next, I’m watching my friends' stories of them out having fun… while I proceed to do absolutely NOTHING productive.

For the first time in 20 years I took a long flight. This was exactly 4 weeks ago today. From LA to Dubai. When I landed, I ripped off my leggings cause they were so tight and noticed my lower leg was swollen. For reference I'm 5'9 and 128 pounds.  I was SHOCKED. I thought, my mom and my aunt (her sister) have this, not me, I'm too young. The swelling lasted two weeks. 

This morning I woke up and my ankle is swollen and my calf is tight. It hurts to walk but I'm managing. The past 3 days, I've been grinding on the computer hard while drinking coffee (Spanish latte super sweet), morning pastries, and barely any water, ordering takeout bc I have no time for my healthy routine (I usually do celery juice, fruit till noon, AND I'm plant based) but I literally had McDonalds yesterday (fries, coke & a sundae lol), the two days before that weren't the best either. This again isn't normal for me, but I miss LA for its health consciousness and I'm across the world. 

I will also say, that i had a grade 2/3 ankle sprain on my LEFT ankle in 2022 that I haven't quite healed from (lots of pain), but I dont think the swelling is compensatory or else I would've had it in LA.

This is my first time starting a post so please go easy on me haha!

I had a 7 stages filtering system installed yesterday so I could drink chlorine-free tap water finally. My stomach is already thanking me after my morning coffee (I used to get really bad pain every morning before this), so it certainly is doing its job.

However, I cannot seem to tolerate the carbon-like, powdery texture and taste. It makes me avoid drinking water unless I am very thirsty, which is bad for my underlying health conditions, since I need to stay super hydrated or else. It even has a strange slight coloration, which I attribute to the mineralization filter.

1. This was a pretty big investment so I would like to if possible make the most of it with minimal effort. I know RO would've probably helped more and maybe even some more research before purchasing might have changed everything. I trusted the online reviews and now I'm stuck with this for the time being.
2. Bottled water is hardly a solution for me since I live alone and I have trouble carrying all that weight around from the shop to the apartment. I used to, and then I got bed bound for an entire summer with back issues.
3. I am thinking there must be something simple and easy I can do - like pouring in a few drops of lime, or adding some of those crazy (sugar-free) WaterTok stuff, as long as they're available for purchase in Eastern Europe. Maybe ice tea. I saw some articles suggesting adding mint or thyme directly.
4. Do any of you think there is a chance I might actually get used to the taste over time, based on your own experience? I will certainly give it more time than just 1 day and experiment with stuff like I mentioned in point 3...

You ever just sit there, drowning in a sea of pending essays, unfinished flashcards, and an untouched past-paper folder… but instead of doing anything, you scroll? And scroll. And suddenly it’s 2 AM, your guilt is screaming, but your motivation is nowhere to be found?  

Yeah, that’s me. Every. Single. Day.

I’m deep into some random conspiracy theory about how pigeons are government spies. And don’t even get me started on the ""I'll start at 5:00 sharp"" mindset, only to see it's 5:02, so now I *have* to wait till 6:00.   

And then there’s the balance—trying to be a good student while also maintaining friendships, family, and maybe even a relationship (if you’re brave). One second, I’m typing ""sorry, I can't come, I have to study,"" and the next, I’m watching my friends' stories of them out having fun… while I proceed to do absolutely NOTHING productive.

1jfkibd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1jfkibd/are_sleep_patches_safe/,Are Sleep Patches Safe?,"I’ve struggled with sleep issues for years and have tried almost everything—melatonin pills, herbal teas, sleep supplements, and even meditation. Some worked for a while, but I always worried about side effects or long-term use.

When I first heard about **sleep patches**, my biggest question was: **Are they actually safe?** Unlike pills, which go through digestion, **sleep patches absorb through the skin**, so I wanted to know if that made a difference.

To find out, I tested **Wellamoon sleep patches** for a full month. Here’s everything I learned.

# How Do Sleep Patches Work?

Sleep patches use **transdermal absorption**, meaning they deliver ingredients directly through the skin instead of the digestive system. This allows for **slow, controlled release** throughout the night, which is different from melatonin pills that hit your system all at once.

The **Wellamoon sleep patch** contains:

* **Melatonin (7mg)** – A natural sleep hormone that helps regulate the body’s sleep-wake cycle.
* **Valerian Root (27mg)** – Traditionally used to promote relaxation and reduce stress.
* **Hops (16.53mg)** – Known for calming effects and improving sleep quality.
* **Magnesium Malate (41.32mg)** – Supports muscle relaxation and deeper sleep.

Because these are **natural, non-habit-forming ingredients**, the risk of dependency is lower than with prescription sleep aids.

For full details, this is where I got mine: [**Wellamoon Sleep Patch Info**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2J8ZH9TQ/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# Are Sleep Patches Safe for Daily Use?

This was my biggest concern. After researching, here’s what I found:

* **No harmful chemicals** – The ingredients in **Wellamoon sleep patches** are common in natural sleep supplements.
* **No risk of overdose** – Unlike high-dose melatonin pills, patches release ingredients gradually.
* **No dependency issues** – There are no addictive substances.
* **No morning grogginess** – One of the main reasons I stopped using melatonin pills was the drowsiness they caused the next day. The **Wellamoon sleeping patch** didn’t give me that feeling.

That said, I did notice **mild skin irritation** when I applied the patch to the same spot multiple nights in a row. After switching to a different area each night, the issue stopped.

# First Week – Getting Used to the Patch

On the **first night**, I didn’t notice much for the first 30 minutes. Then, I started to feel **relaxed but not drowsy**. I fell asleep **about 20 minutes faster than usual** and only woke up once.

By the end of the **first week**, I had:

* **Easier time falling asleep**
* **Fewer wake-ups during the night**
* **No grogginess in the morning**

# Weeks 2-3 – Sleep Pattern Changes

By the second and third weeks, I started to notice more consistency. Sleep felt **deeper** and I wasn’t waking up as much. Even on nights I skipped the patch, I found it **easier to fall asleep naturally**.

Other things I noticed:

* I had **more energy** during the day.
* My **mood improved**, likely from better sleep.
* I wasn’t relying on multiple cups of coffee just to stay alert.

# Week 4 – Is It Safe Long-Term?

After a full month of using **Wellamoon sleep patches**, I didn’t experience any negative effects. No withdrawal, no dependence, and my sleep cycle actually felt more natural.

For people wondering about safety, I think these are **a better alternative to melatonin pills**. Since the body absorbs them gradually, there’s no risk of taking **too much at once**.

If you’re considering it, here’s where I found more details: [**Wellamoon Sleep Patch Details**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2J8ZH9TQ/?uid=34563&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# Are Sleep Patches Safe for Everyone?

While my experience was good, I looked into some general safety guidelines:

* **If you have sensitive skin**, rotate where you place the patch.
* **If you’re pregnant, nursing, or taking medication**, check with a doctor first.
* **Not for severe insomnia** – If you have major sleep disorders, patches alone may not be enough.

# Final Thoughts – Are Sleep Patches Worth Trying?

For me, **Wellamoon sleep patches** were safe and effective. They helped me:

* Fall asleep **faster**
* Stay asleep **longer**
* Wake up **without grogginess**

They won’t work the same for everyone, but compared to melatonin pills, they **feel more natural** and don’t come with the same side effects.

Financial problems triggered their separation.

My parents have a large house, with a garage attached that has been remodeled into an apartment. My brother (24) used to live in this apartment. While my parents are not fighting, they didn't want to live in the main house together anymore and considered selling. My brother was against this, the house comes with stables for horses and he is a farrier and has 2 horses of his own in these stables.

They came up with the following construction: my brother moves into the main house together with his girlfriend. At the time they were together for 6 months. My dad continues to live in the house, and as COVID has mainly passed he is now abroad a lot again and so he limits himself to his bedroom, attached bathroom and office space. My mom moves into the garage apartment, unhappily, but she has no choice because she has no money and can't find a job as she has no significant degrees nor job experience for the past 25 years.

The kicker is, they allow my brother to move into a house worth 1.4M FOR FREE, and exploit the stables FOR FREE. So my brother is making money as a farrier, making money of the stables that his girlfriend tends to (who is currently pregnant and following the footsteps of my mom, as she has no job or income of her own). The argument for this is that my brother needs to save up as much money as he can, so his turnover is as large as possible so eventually he can buy my mom's part of the mortgage (my parent didn't have much of a prenup, but my mom and dad are not equal owners of the house).

Now, my brother, 24 years old, is parading around like he owns the place. Talking big to everyone he knows. As if he made it. Even though he didn't pay for any of it. All he did was take benefit of our parents' separation, knowingly taking advantage of our mom who is so scared to break our non-existing familial bond. She is too scared to tell everyone that we should sell the house so she can move on. She desparately wants to get out, but she is stuck there.

Doesn't mean I'm not pissed at my mom. She is not sticking up for herself, sticking to maintaining good relationships that barely exist. My brother is extremely rude to her. When she asks his girlfriend to put my mom's dog outside at a certain time when she's gonna for a whole day, my brother will stampede to her and tell my mom she can't expect these things. My brother never invites her over for coffee, but the girlfriend's family gets invited for dinner every week. He's more respectful to these people than his own parents who have made sacrifices to him they didn't have to make.

My mom can't leave. She has no money to find accommodation up to her standard. She refuses to settle for less than the living standard she's always had with my dad. Waiting for my brother to buy her out of the mortgage is gonna take very long, and her emotional wellbeing is suffering while she's living in the apartment as she's still stuck in the place she didn't want to be, which was a big reason for her to separate from my dad to begin with. It's as if the separation was for nothing, because she can't get away from my dad. She is, and will remain, financially depended on him because she has no skills, is too old to get another degree, and is too much used to a high standard of living.

Now, they have decided they will build a house further out on the property for my mom to move into. Where I was saying from the beginning you cannot just get a permit for that, they all thought it'd be fine. It wasn't fine, as an advisor told them it could take years to get a permit for something like this. He recommended them to request a doctor's note that my mom needs, or will need, intense care regarding her health. She has COPD yes, but she's also not of retirement age and working a minimum wage job right now (part-time), I don't see how a doctor is gonna provide a note for this? If a doctor would, sure they could build something permit-free. BUT AGAIN. I expect my mom will be disappointed, because this building is not allowed to be permanent, so it won't be nice, pretty, etc. Not what she expects. I just see disappointment incoming again.

I'm so exhausted by these dynamics, because I feel like I'm always the mediator in these situations. I live far enough away to not have to visit too much, but every time I'm there it's only about them, their situation, what are the updates. I feel like no one interests themselves in my life, and when they do it's so surface level it's not as if I'm talking to close family. It's come to the point where I get anxious when I get called by any of them, or see text messages regarding this. I wish I could remove myself from the situation.

And then there is also the envy. It feels so disgusting to feel this way. But I feel unfairly treated. I'm not making much money as I'm doing my PhD, but I'm getting by and taking care of myself. I have roommates, a boyfriend and friends in this new place, but I make sacrifices to save enough money so I can travel, go on trips, do the things important to me. Whereas my brother is living in a massive house for free, doesn't have to deal with roommates, lives with his girlfriend, is able to kickstart his career at such a young age so easily because of what my parents built and he's not even appreciating it. I feel so mad. I know my dad wants to keep things fair between us and he constantly tells me he'll support me financially if he can when the time comes for me to buy a house or if I ever want to start a business. I truly appreciate having grown up in a wealthy family where money was never a problem and I never had to worry, where my dad acknowledges what my brother is getting and I'm not. But I can't help but feel this envy, feel so mad, towards my bratty brother. I wish I could scream at him and my mom for all the reasons above. That he's a spoiled brat. That my mom needs to stick up for herself. To just kick my brother and his girlfriend out, as at least they have money to find a house for themselves whereas my mom doesn't. To change something.

Also known as colon cancer, this type of cancer begins in the colon or large intestine and can develop from certain polyps or growths in its inner lining. Screening tests play a crucial role in detecting precancerous polyps before they turn into cancerous tumors.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer globally, accounting for around 10% of all cancer cases. In 2020, over 1.9 million new cases and more than 930,000 deaths due to this disease were reported worldwide. Early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. It's important to be aware of the symptoms, risk factors, and preventive measures associated with colon cancer.

Colorectal cancer symptoms can vary, but here are some common signs to watch for:

- Blood in your stool: This can manifest as blood in the toilet or after wiping or may show as dark or bright red in your poop. However, blood in stool does not automatically indicate colon cancer.
- Persistent bowel habit changes: This includes ongoing constipation or diarrhea, or a sensation of needing to poop even after using the bathroom.
- Abdominal pain: Unexplained and persistent belly pain should be discussed with a healthcare provider, as it may be an indicator of potential issues.
- Bloating: A bloated feeling lasting over a week, particularly if accompanied by other symptoms like vomiting or blood in stool, warrants medical attention.
- Unexplained weight loss: A noticeable drop in weight without any intention to lose it can also be a symptom.
- Frequent vomiting: Regular vomiting for no identifiable reason may need further investigation.
- Fatigue and shortness of breath: These symptoms may point towards anemia, which can be associated with colon cancer.

Several lifestyle choices and medical conditions can increase the risk of developing colon cancer. These include:

- Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption
- Obesity
- Diets high in red and processed meats
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Inflammatory bowel diseases
- Inherited conditions, such as Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis
- Family history of colon cancer and polyps

To reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, consider the following preventive measures:

- Avoid tobacco in any form and seek help to quit if necessary.
- Drink alcohol in moderation and maintain a healthy body weight.
- Incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet while cutting back on red meat and high-fat foods. Research suggests that drinking coffee may lower your risk.
- Keep track of your family's medical history and discuss any relevant conditions with your healthcare provider.
- Follow recommended screening guidelines and consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice, especially if you have a family history of the disease.

* The data I'm looking for tends to be concentrated on a couple pages, but every company formats their documents differently. Would it make sense to do a cheaper pre-analysis to find the important pages before I pass them to a more expensive/accurate LLM to extract the data?

1jfkd0v,https://i.redd.it/oj8ziaxo4tpe1.jpeg,What does coffee do to the body: What does science say?,"Metabolism: It can increase the metabolic rate by 3–11%, which helps burn fat. However, the body may become tolerant to caffeine in the long term.

3. Effects on the digestive system

Bowel activity: Coffee activates the hormones gastrin and cholecystokinin, which increase the movement of bile and intestines (which is why some people feel the urge to poop immediately after drinking coffee).

Acidity: The acidic nature of coffee can cause heartburn or indigestion in some people.

4. Diuretic effect

- Caffeine increases urine output, but moderate intake (2–3 cups/day) does not cause dehydration. Those who consume more are advised to drink water.

5. Long-term benefits and risks**

Benefits:

- Rich in antioxidants, reduces inflammation and oxidative stress

 - Evidence of reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and liver disease.

Risks:
High intake (more than 400 mg/day) may cause insomnia, anxiety, or irregular heartbeat.

- Some studies have shown a link to decreased bone density (caffeine can affect calcium absorption).

6. Individual differences

Genes: The speed at which caffeine is metabolized varies depending on the type of CYP1A2 gene. Some people feel the effects faster or last longer.

Pregnancy: Pregnant women are advised to limit their caffeine intake to less than 200 mg per day (about 1–2 cups).

 Conclusion:

According to science, in moderate amounts (up to 3–4 cups per day) the benefits of coffee outweigh the risks

Much denser. The map Tom had insisted on navigating with was crumpled in his hands, the edges frayed from his constant fidgeting. I tried to stay calm, but the shadows stretching across the trail as the sun dipped lower weren’t helping. Every rustle of leaves made my heart skip a beat.

“We’re fine, Ellie,” Tom said, his voice tight. “We just need to keep moving.”

*“Fine?”* I shot back, my voice rising. “We’ve been walking in circles for hours. My feet are killing me, and we’re completely lost. This isn’t **fine**.”

He didn’t respond. I knew he was just as worried as I was, but his pride wouldn’t let him admit it. We kept trudging forward, the air growing cooler as the light faded. My stomach churned with a mix of hunger and anxiety. How had this happened? We’d just wanted a weekend getaway, a chance to reconnect after months of work swallowing us whole. Now, here we were, stranded in the middle of nowhere.

And then I saw it—a flicker of light through the trees. A cabin.

“Tom, look!” I grabbed his arm, pointing. “There’s someone there.”

He squinted, hesitating. “Could be anyone. We don’t know if they’re friendly.”

“Friendly or not, it’s our best shot. We’re not surviving out here overnight.”

He sighed, finally nodding, and we made our way toward the light. The cabin was rustic but sturdy, smoke curling from the chimney. As we approached, the door swung open, and a man stepped out. My breath caught.

He was tall, his broad shoulders filling the doorway, a flannel shirt rolled up to his elbows. His dark hair was slightly messy, like he’d been running his fingers through it, and his jaw was shadowed with stubble. But it was his eyes that held me—sharp, piercing, and impossibly blue. *Jackson.* His name came to me instantly, though I couldn’t have said why.

“Lost?” he asked, his voice deep and gravelly, like it hadn’t been used in a while.

“Uh, yeah,” Tom said, stepping forward. “We got turned around on the trail. We were hoping you could help us get back to the main road.”

Jackson studied us for a moment, his gaze lingering on me a little longer than necessary. I felt a flush rise to my cheeks, though whether it was from the cold or something else, I wasn’t sure.

“Come in,” he said finally, stepping aside. “It’s too late to head out now. You can stay the night and I’ll get you sorted in the morning.”

The cabin was warm and smelled of pine and something smoky, like the lingering scent of a campfire. Jackson moved with ease, pulling out chairs for us at the small wooden table. He poured us each a cup of coffee from a pot on the stove, the steam curling into the air.

“Thanks,” I said, wrapping my hands around the mug. The warmth seeped into my fingers, and I felt myself beginning to relax.

Jackson leaned against the counter, his arms crossed. “What brought you two out here?”

“Just a hiking trip,” Tom said, his tone a little too casual. “We were supposed to be back by now, but… well, you know how it goes.”

Jackson’s lips twitched into a faint smirk. “Yeah. I know.”

There was something about the way he looked at me, like he could see right through my carefully constructed walls. It was unnerving, but also… thrilling. I couldn’t help but notice the way his muscles shifted under his shirt as he moved, the way his eyes seemed to darken when they met mine.

“You’re not from around here,” Jackson said, his voice low.

“No,” I admitted. “We’re from the city. Just wanted to get away for a while.”

He nodded, his gaze never leaving mine. “City life can be suffocating. Out here, it’s different. Simpler.”

“I can see that,” I said softly.

Tom cleared his throat, breaking the tension. “So, uh, Jackson, how long have you been out here?”

“Few years,” he replied, finally looking away. “I prefer it. No noise, no people. Just the woods.”

There was something in his tone, a hint of bitterness or maybe just loneliness. I couldn’t tell. But it made me curious. Who was this man, living out here all alone? What had driven him to isolate himself like this?

The hours passed, the conversation flowing easier as the coffee warmed us. Jackson told us stories about the wildlife in the area, about the storms that rolled through the mountains. His voice was mesmerizing, and I found myself hanging on every word. Tom, on the other hand, seemed to be growing more restless, his leg tapping under the table.

Finally, Jackson stood. “You’re probably tired. I’ve got a spare room upstairs. You can take it.”

“Thanks,” Tom said, standing quickly. “We’ll be out of your hair in the morning.”

Jackson nodded, his gaze shifting to me. “Ellie, you need anything before you turn in?”

“No, I’m fine,” I said, though my voice felt unsteady. “Thank you. For everything.”

He gave me a small nod, and I followed Tom up the narrow stairs to the spare room. It was cozy, with a large bed and a window overlooking the woods. Tom collapsed onto the bed almost immediately, but I lingered by the window, staring out at the darkness.

I couldn’t shake the feeling that had settled in my chest since we’d arrived. It wasn’t just gratitude for Jackson’s hospitality. It was something deeper, something that made my skin tingle and my heart race. I tried to push it down, to focus on the practicalities of getting back to safety in the morning. But as I lay down next to Tom, his snores filling the room, I couldn’t stop thinking about Jackson’s piercing blue eyes.

The night stretched on, and sleep eluded me. My mind kept drifting back to the way Jackson had looked at me, the heat in his gaze that had nothing to do with the fire in the hearth. I tossed and turned, my body restless.

Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore. I slipped out of bed, careful not to wake Tom, and crept downstairs. The cabin was quiet, the only sound the crackling of the fire. I hesitated at the bottom of the stairs, my heart pounding in my chest. What was I doing? This was crazy.

And then I saw him. Jackson was sitting by the fire, a glass of whiskey in his hand. He looked up as I approached, his expression unreadable.

“Couldn’t sleep?” he asked, his voice low.

“No,” I admitted, my voice barely above a whisper.

He studied me for a moment, then gestured to the chair beside him. “Sit.”

I did, perching on the edge of the seat. The firelight flickered across his face, highlighting the sharp angles of his jaw. He handed me the glass, his fingers brushing mine, and the contact sent a shiver down my spine.

“Thanks,” I murmured, taking a sip. The whiskey burned, but it was a good burn, one that grounded me.

We sat in silence for a while, the fire crackling between us. I could feel the tension in the air, thick and electric. Finally, Jackson spoke.

“You’re not like him,” he said, his gaze fixed on the flames.

“What do you mean?” I asked, though I knew exactly what he meant.

“You’re… different. Stronger. Like you’re meant for something more than the life you’re living.”

His words hit me like a punch to the gut. They were too close to the truth, to the restlessness I’d been feeling for months. I looked at him, really looked at him, and saw the same thing reflected in his eyes.

Jackson leaned closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. “What do you want, Ellie?”

My breath caught. I knew what I wanted. I wanted the heat of his skin against mine, the weight of his body pressing me into the couch. I wanted to feel alive, to forget the monotony of my everyday life and lose myself in him.

But before I could answer, his lips were on mine, hot and insistent. The glass slipped from my hand as I reached for him, my fingers tangling in his hair. The world fell away, and there was nothing but the taste of whiskey on his tongue and the fire burning between us.

His hands moved to my waist, pulling me onto his lap. I could feel the hardness of him beneath me, and it made my head spin. I moaned into his mouth, my hips grinding against his almost involuntarily. He broke the kiss, his breath ragged, and looked at me with those piercing blue eyes.

“Tell me you want this,” he growled.

“I want this,” I whispered, my voice trembling with need. “I want you.”

Jackson’s hands tightened on my hips, and he stood, lifting me with him. His strength was intoxicating, and I wrapped my legs around his waist. He carried me to the couch, laying me down and looming over me.

“You have no idea what you do to me,” he murmured, his lips brushing my ear.

“Show me,” I breathed, my fingers fumbling with the buttons of his shirt.

He didn’t hesitate. His hands were everywhere, peeling off my clothes and his with equal urgency. His skin was hot under my palms, his muscles flexing as he moved. He kissed me again, deep and demanding, and I melted into him.

When he finally entered me, it was like nothing I’d ever felt before. My back arched, and I cried out, my nails digging into his shoulders. He moved with a rhythm that was both fierce and tender, his eyes locked on mine.

“You’re so fucking beautiful,” he murmured, his voice rough with desire.

I couldn’t speak, couldn’t think. There was only him, only the way he filled me and the way my body responded. The firelight danced across his skin as he moved, and I lost myself in the sensation, in the raw, primal connection between us.

“Jackson,” I gasped, my hands gripping his biceps. “Don’t stop.”

He didn’t. He drove me higher and higher, until I thought I might shatter. And when I finally came, it was with a cry of his name on my lips, my body trembling with the force of it. He followed me over the edge, his breath hot against my neck as he groaned my name.

We lay there afterward, tangled together and breathing hard. The fire crackled softly in the background, and I felt a peace I hadn’t known in years. But as I looked up at Jackson, his eyes dark and unreadable, I couldn’t help but wonder…",1,1742460085.0,u_Real_Button_2421,0,1.0,False

Lol,"In recent months I have been doing this thing where instead of trying to go back to sleep if I wake up in the middle of the night, I just go with it and walk out to my living room and start watching YouTube on all kinds of topics, going down many wormholes (its 4 AM right now for example). This usually happens after 3-5 hours of sleep. I used to really focus on getting 6-9 hours as that what most studies say we need, but once I start ""trying"" to go back to sleep many times it can be counterproductive to the goal. 

I'm finding that not fighting it and just enjoying this time to myself to learn or just veg has actually been a lot of fun, and more interestingly im not that tired. It feels like I'm kind of getting away with extra hours before my day starts at no cost. Have any of u experienced getting only a few hours and letting our hyperactive brains just kind of go into overdrive and found it was beneficial - that wasn't that costly for your health? Usually two coffees, one in the morning and one around lunch and I feel fine.

I'm just slightly concerned as I know sleep is super important. However I'm curious if our brains might be a little better at handling this as we are programmed for level 9 million thoughts per minute.

Pros- 
More time to learn and just enjoy YouTube 
Less stress about trying to sleep

Cons-

The hour is indecent. The coffee has gone cold—or maybe we forgot we made it. Again. Our eyes are wide, unblinking, caught somewhere between insomnia and inspiration, and instead of sleeping like well-adjusted humans, we’re here. Musing. Spiraling. Writing.
Because storytelling doesn’t keep office hours.
So welcome to Late Night Musings with Rogues and Scoundrels—where thoughts swirl like plot twists at 2 AM, where screenplays get torn apart and stitched back together, and where we explore the beautiful, messy, gut-wrenching world of filmmaking and storytelling.

Prepare yourself—but only mildly, this takes less time than choosing a show on Netflix. 

The Cinematic Alchemy of Adaptation: From Page to Screen

By Rogues and Scoundrels

There is a unique form of suffering reserved for screenwriters adapting a novel.

It’s not just about honoring the original text—no, that would be too easy. It’s about translating prose into moving images, sculpting sentences into cinematography, turning internal monologues into something an actor can actually do without staring blankly into the void for 45 seconds - Though, let’s be honest, sometimes that’s the right choice.

This week, we cracked open the spine of Displaced Person once more, armed with annotated pages, storyboards, and an existential dread reserved for those who willingly attempt adaptation. Because as you know dear reader, what works beautifully on the page doesn’t always work on screen—and that’s where the real alchemy begins.

Not Just Recreating the Book—Crafting a Visual Language

A novel lets you live inside a character’s head, marinating in their thoughts, memories, and existential musings. A screenplay? A screenplay does not care about beautifully written introspection—it cares about what we see, what we hear, and what we feel through action and imagery.

And that’s exactly what we are enjoying throughout this process -working with a single line of narration in the novel that is working out sometimes to take two minutes of screen time to convey visually.

We are busy working on Graeme’s deep internal crisis to capture it in a glance, or a gesture, or a lingering frame—otherwise, we’ll be writing too much voiceover.

And of course those scenes you come back to that are packed with dialogue - well, we’ve cut it in half. Then cut it again. Then asked ourselves: Can this be said with a look?

And yet, we must stay true to the soul of Displaced Person.

The novel’s haunting loneliness, its sense of detachment, its eerie, prophetic vision of a world disconnected from itself—these must be felt rather than told. And that’s where visual storytelling becomes everything.


Building the Aesthetic: Late ’70s Nostalgia Meets a Timeless Void

One of the great joys (and by joys, we mean soul-crushing challenges) of this adaptation is preserving the novel’s late-’70s setting while making its themes feel timeless.

The grey world Harding envisioned—this liminal space where people vanish, lost between existence and erasure—has only become more relevant in the digital age. Social media, AI, the pandemic-induced collapse of human connection—it’s all there. But visually? It needs to feel like something tangible, textural, real.

Do we lean into film grain, muted color palettes, and lo-fi futurism?
Or do we embrace an unsettling stillness, framing each shot like a memory slowly dissolving at the edges?
(Or do we just let the protagonist stare into the abyss for 45 seconds and call it a day?)

The answer, as always, is somewhere in between.

Adapting a Cult Classic: The Balancing Act of Reinvention

We are not here to rewrite history. We are here to breathe it into new life—to take what made Displaced Person unforgettable, unsettling, and ahead of its time, and make it cinematic, immersive, and urgent for a new audience.

This is the alchemy of adaptation. A delicate balancing act between preserving the essence of the book and embracing the power of film to tell it differently, wordlessly, viscerally.

So as we continue shaping this vision—through frustration, inspiration, and the occasional descent into the adaptation abyss—we leave you with this thought:

How do you tell a story about disappearing into the void, without letting it disappear in the process?

We’re working on that.

Solo per fare qualche esempio, dopo 2 mesi e passa che lavoro ho scoperto la porta del bagno aveva una chiave. Oppure una volta mi hanno dato una volta un pocket coffee, non sapevo cos'era e dato che metto l'apparecchio tendo sempre a spezzarle le cose (Per capirci il dentista mi ha detto di non fare bocconi troppo grandi, non mangiare cose troppo dure e di non addentare, ma anche lì chi vedo che ha l'apparecchio non fa mai queste cose), naturalmente mi è esploso in mano ma cerco di prenderla sul ridere. O un'altra volta mi chiedono quando prendo il pullman, mi confondo un attimo e dico 8:30 anziché 6:30 (perché sul telefono capito mi dice 18:00) e che quindi tornavo a casa verso le 7:30. Anche lì cerco di prenderla sul ridere. Poi tra me e me dico che sono cose che capitano. Cavolo solo a me capitano queste cose, ma soprattutto di continuo.

Oppure ogni volta che qualcuno mi chiama o mi dice qualcosa chiedo sempre di ripetere perché non sento, e faccio la figura del sordo.Poi quando qualsiasi persona mi fa domande sull'attualità, cantanti e cose varie non so mai un cazzo, e faccio la figura dell'ignorante.
