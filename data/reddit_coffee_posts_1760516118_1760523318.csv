I’ve always loved the smell of fresh coffee in the morning. But one question kept crossing my mind: *Can this daily cup actually help me live longer?*

It turns out — science says **yes, it might**.

Over the years, hundreds of studies have linked coffee to **better health, lower disease risks, and longer lifespan**. But let’s break that down in simple terms.

# 🌿 What Makes Coffee So Special?

Coffee isn’t just about caffeine. It’s full of **antioxidants**, **polyphenols**, and **essential nutrients** that protect our cells from damage. These compounds help fight inflammation and slow aging — two of the main reasons our bodies weaken over time.

Here’s what a typical cup of black coffee gives you:

**Nutrient**

**Function in the Body**

**Benefit**

**Antioxidants**

Neutralize free radicals

Slow aging, protect cells

**Polyphenols**

Anti-inflammatory compound

Reduce chronic disease risk

**Magnesium**

Muscle & nerve function

Regulates heart rhythm

**Niacin (B3)**

Energy production

Supports brain & skin health

**Caffeine**

Natural stimulant

Boosts alertness & metabolism

That’s why coffee is often called a **“functional beverage”** — meaning it does more than just wake you up.

# ☕ Coffee and Longevity: The Global Evidence

Scientists around the world have studied the effects of coffee on human lifespan.

Here are some key findings that amazed me:

· A 2022 study published in the *Annals of Internal Medicine* found that people who drank **2–4 cups of coffee daily** had a **30% lower risk of early death** compared to non-drinkers.

· A Harvard School of Public Health study involving **200,000 participants** found that regular coffee drinkers had a **15% lower risk of premature death** from all causes.

· The *European Journal of Epidemiology* reviewed 40 studies and concluded that each extra cup of coffee per day was linked to a **6–7% lower risk of death**.

That’s powerful evidence.

So yes — coffee may truly help us live longer. But how? Let’s explore the science behind it.

# How Coffee Can Boost Longevity — Backed by Science

Coffee works on several levels to support long-term health. I’ll explain each benefit in simple words, so you can easily understand how your daily brew helps your body.

1o76fg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1o76fg3/have_i_understood_the_free_will_debate_correctly/,Have I understood the free will debate correctly?,"Ideally, we would like to know what free will *is* supposed to be. Whether you're defending or denying the existence of free will, we want to know what it is supposed to be.

Historically, philosophers have proposed two potential necessary conditions for having free will. Put simply, philosophers have offered two criteria that might be required for something to count as having free will. We can call these criteria ""Leeway"" & ""Sourcehood"":

* **Leeway**: A person has free will only if that person could have made a different choice or could have performed a different action other than the one they chose
* **Sourcehood**: A person has free will only if that person is the source of their choice or is the source of their action

Proponents & deniers of free will can argue that both Leeway & Sourcehood are required for having free will, proponents & deniers of free will can argue that only Leeway is required for having free will, proponents & deniers of free will can argue that only Sourcehood is required for having free will, or proponents & deniers of free will can argue that neither Leeway nor Sourcehood are required for having free will.

For those who think that Leeway is required for free will, we need a further analysis of what an ""ability"" is supposed to be. Traditionally, there have been two approaches to how to analyze an ""ability"":

* **Conditional Analyses of Ability**: A person can φ if & only if said person would φ if said person had certain inclinations, motivations, desires, wants, etc., to φ
* **Categorical Analyses of Ability**: A person can φ only if it is possible, in some restricted sense, for said person to φ

Proponents of a conditional analysis hold that for someone to count as having an ability, it is possible for them to act in a certain way when certain conditions are met. For example, suppose I sit down for lunch and have a desire for a cup of coffee, and I order a cup of coffee at lunch. Now, suppose we wanted to say that I had the ability to order a cup of tea (instead of a cup of coffee) at lunch. On the conditional analysis, we would say that the following subjective conditional needs to be true: *if I had desired a cup of tea, then I would have ordered a cup of tea*. Put differently, what it means for me to have the ability to order a cup of tea at lunch is for there to be a possible world (or hypothetical situation) where I desired tea & I ordered a cup of tea. In contrast, proponents of the categorical analysis hold that more than mere possibility is required for someone to count as having an ability. For example, a proponent of the categorical analysis might point out that we are sometimes able to do something (e.g., hit a home run) without having the ability to do it again. A proponent of the categorical analysis of ability may claim that to say that I can order a cup of tea at lunch only if there is a possible world that is indiscernible from the actual world up until the moment I start to deliberate on what beverage to order.

For those who think that Sourcehood is required for free will, we need a further analysis of what it means to be the ""source"" of something. There are, at least, three candidates for thinking about sourcehood:

* **Reason-Responsive Views**: A person is the source of their φ-ing only if there is a process, such that (1) the process results in the person φ-ing & the process is responsive to the reasons available to said person
* **Identification Views**: A person is the source of their φ-ing only if said person identifies with the reasons, motivations, desires, etc., that cause said person to φ.
* **""True"" Sourcehood Views**: A person is the source of their φ-ing only if said person's φ-ing is not causally necessitated by factors beyond their control

Proponents of the reason-responsive view hold that a person counts as the source of their choice or the source of their action when the process that led to their decision or led to their action is responsive to new information, reasons, or evidence. For example, suppose I am trying to decide whether I should go to a cafe or a restaurant for lunch. Now, suppose that just as I decide I'm going to go the the restaurant, my friend tells me that the owner of the restaurant treats their employees poorly. Given this new information, I changed my mind and decided to go to the cafe for lunch. Proponents of the identification view hold that a person counts as the source of their choice or the source of their action when they take their choice or their action as representative of who they are; the person's choice or action says something about who they are as a person or reveals something about who they truly are. For instance, reconsider the earlier example. We might take it that my choice to not eat at the restaurant says something about the political views that I identify with. Unlike the proponents of the reasons-responsive view or the identification view, proponents of the ""true"" sourcehood view offer a negative analysis of what it means to be the source of a choice or action. Again, let's consider our earlier example. Suppose my initial decision to eat at the restaurant was caused by my previous dining experiences. On this view, while those experiences played a causal role in my decision to go to the restaurant, those previous experiences would not have *necessitated* my decision to go to the restaurant.

Once the defenders & deniers of free will have decided what free will is supposed to be (or what is required for someone to count as having free will), the next question to consider is whether or not Determinism is true. 

There are different ways of thinking about Determinism, such as Causal Determinism, Theological Determinism, or Logical Determinism. However, contemporary discussions of free will tend to focus on Causal Determinism, so I'll focus on Causal Determinism as well. Consider the following two metaphysical theses:

* **Causal Determinism**: For any world W, given the laws of nature & prior events, all present & future events are logically necessitated by previous events & the laws of nature
* **Causal Indeterminism**: For any world W, given the laws of nature & prior events, some present or future events are not logically necessitated by previous events & the laws of nature.

We can say that causal determinism is a metaphysical thesis, and causal indeterminism is its antithesis. Proponents of causal determinism hold that *every* current or future event is *logically entailed* by past events & the laws of nature. In contrast, the proponent of causal indeterminism holds that there are *some* current or future events that are *not logically entailed* by past events & the laws of nature.

What is a ""law of nature""? Answering this question will help shed some light on what makes causal determinism causal (and how it contrasts with other forms of determinism). First, it is worth pointing out that the ""laws of nature"" shouldn't be confused with the laws posited by the natural sciences. Second, philosophers tend to think of the ""laws of nature"" in one of two ways:

* **Regularity (or Humean) Views**: It is a law that all Fs are Gs if & only if all Fs are Gs
* **Nomic (or Non-Humean) Views**: It is a law that all Fs are Gs if & only if an instance of F-ness is nomologically necessitated by an instance of G-ness

Proponents of the regularity view hold that a law of nature is merely a regularity of some sort. For example, if there is a regular pattern of swans being white, or emeralds being green, then this is all we mean by a law. Proponents of the nomic view hold that a law of nature requires us to posit a type of *physical necessity* that exists between instances of properties. For example, we may want to say that there is a law that all diamonds are hard if *every* instance of a diamond *physically necessitates* its being an instance of hardness.

So, depending on our view of laws, we can ask whether every current or future event is logically entailed by past events & laws understood as mere regularities, or if every current or future event is logically entailed by past events & laws understood as nomic necessitations?

Once our defenders & deniers of free will have become defenders or deniers of causal determinism, we can now consider whether they think free will is consistent with causal determinism. We can consider the following theses:

* **Compatibilism**: possibly, causal determinism is true & there is free will
* **Incompatibilism**: necessarily, either causal determinism is false or there is no free will

Proponents of compatibilism hold that there is, at least, one world (either actual or possible) where (1) that world is causally determined & (2) we -- or our counterparts -- have free will. In other words, we can act in ways that are free or make free choices even though all current & future events are logically entailed by past events & the laws of nature. Proponents of incompatibilism hold that all worlds (either actual or possible) are either (1) worlds that are causally indeterministic or (2) we -- or our counterparts --  do not have free will. Basically, the world cannot be causally deterministic & we have free will.

Furthermore, we can also just focus on views about our world in particular. There seem to be at least four views we could adopt: 

* **Soft Compatibilism**: Compatibilism is true & our world is causally deterministic, but we also have free will
* **Libertarianism**: Incompatibilism is true & we have free will 
* **Hard Determinism**: Incompatibilism is true & our world is causally deterministic
* **Hard Indeterminism**: Incompatibilism is true & our world is causally indeterministic, but we also don't have free will 
* **Hard Incompatibilism**: If our world is causally deterministic or causally indeterministic, then we don't have free will

As a travel guide who often takes groups through Ha Giang and other northern regions like Sapa and Cao Bang, I’ve received many questions about visiting Ha Giang from October to January. Here’s a quick and honest guide based on my experience.

If you plan to visit in October or November, we both know it's the perfect time. The weather is cool and clear, and the famous buckwheat flowers (tam giác mạch) are blooming everywhere in Dong Van and Meo Vac. The temperature is pleasant during the day but drops quickly at night, so bring warm layers, a windproof jacket, and gloves if you plan to ride a motorbike.

During this time Ha Giang gets quite cold, especially around Ma Pi Leng Pass. You might see frost in the early morning. 

# 1. Transport tips

If you’re not confident on a motorbike, hire an easy rider. These guys know every turn, every viewpoint, and where to stop for the best cơm gà or bowl of phở you’ll ever have. You get to enjoy the scenery instead of gripping the handlebar for dear life.

Don’t ride at night. Fog, sharp turns, and zero street lights are not a fun mix. I tried once, I could barely see anything. It was like driving through milk.

Also, make sure you wear a helmet with a visor, not just a half-helmet you’d use for city rides. Bring a proper windproof jacket too. It’s freezing at the top of Mã Pí Lèng after sunset.

# 2. Accommodation tips

Stay in local villages like Lô Lô Chải, Mèo Vạc, Phó Bảng, or Du Già. The experience is completely different from Ha Giang city. You’ll wake up to roosters and misty mountains instead of motorbikes and karaoke.

Book early if you’re coming during the buckwheat flower season or Vietnamese holidays. Rooms get snapped up fast, and prices rise quickly.

Whenever possible, choose family-run homestays. You’ll get a warm bed, homemade food, and probably a shot (or three) of corn wine that you can’t say no to. It’s part of the hospitality.

# 3. Packing tips

Ha Giang weather changes by the hour, so layer up. Bring a light jacket, a fleece, and one heavier coat for early mornings.

Cash is king here. ATMs are rare once you leave the city, so bring enough for food, fuel, and emergencies.

A few other essentials: power bank, basic medicine (especially for motion sickness), and a copy of your ID or passport. You’ll need it for police checkpoints along the Loop.

# 4. Food and culture

Try the local specialties:

* Cháo ấu tẩu – a porridge made from a poisonous root that’s safe only after hours of cooking. Locals swear it keeps you warm and strong.
* Thắng cố – a traditional horse stew for the brave ones. Very authentic, very strong smell.
* Mèn mén – steamed cornmeal, the everyday food of the Hmong. Simple but filling.
* And of course, five-color sticky rice, a must during festivals.

Don’t buy souvenirs from children, especially in touristy spots. It keeps them out of school. Say no politely and move on.

If you’re planning to ride the **Ha Giang Loop**, do it slowly and safely. Three to four days is ideal. You’ll have time to stop for coffee, take photos, and actually enjoy the views instead of racing through them.

Steep 1 pa lang. Won't do the next steeps today. Tomorrow na. 

I just thought I needed to have something warming during this cloudy rainy season. 

After a whole day of butchering and portioning tuna, salmon and tanigue coz my mom decided to go to bulungan and buy a bunch of fish. Then cooking grilled tanigue tail and making tanigue ceviche my way. I decided to reward myself with merienda of banana, one red plum, a slice of sourdough bread and a tea pot of hojicha.


The deets to the steep:

7 grams to 350ml of water
85c water
Steeped for around 3 minutes 

This is what I like about good tea. Long steeps don't get all that bitter. It was unapologetically toasted. But not bitter. It was incredibly mildly bitter. If you're used to drinking black tea, this will be quite a bit less bitter. Mind you I avoided making it bitter on the first place by steeping it much lower than you should. I'll try a hotter temp next time. 

The taste this time borders to black tea with a smokey flavor. But not quite. It smells of toasted wheat bread like I talked about before. If you walked by a nice bake shop, you'll know what I mean. The smell also reminds me of black coffee. Since I made it this time stronger than my previous brew, this will  decidedly smell and taste like something else.

This is the journey we take when drinking tea. Finding out how to brew it, finding how much, how hot, how long. So you tweak teas to how you like it. You make it how you want it. 

As this is low in caffeine being a roasted tea then made with sticks and stems to introduce a different flavor profile then from leaves made of bancha (a lower tier green tea). This will be a great alternative for anyone looking for a coffee alternative. Not to mention you get to make hojicha lattes with the powder form. 

I mean you can make a latte from the loose leaf too if you know what you're doing. 

390 pesos for 100 grams. I would call this a decent cheap alternative for drinking your caffeine if you want something warming, homey, somehow nostalgic (kahit di Naman Tayo japanese).

I looked like a zombie from The Walking Dead. I smelled like a zombie from, uh, I don’t know, but I smelled like ass. 

My little sister tried talking to me in this state, something about ‘needing a ride to school.’ But because I hadn’t had my coffee, I bit the top of her head clean off and ate her brain.

She died.

I survived.

When I drank my coffee five minutes later, though, I realized what I had done, and then to cope with my loss, I drank even more coffee, and more, and more until I threw up and slipped on my vomit and died.

I’m a ghost right now, but because I drank coffee I’m able to materialize into reality just enough to type this.

I live alone, work from home, and I guess I didn't notice how isolated I've become until I tried to think of the last time someone texted me just to chat. Couldn't think of one. My phone is basically just work emails and delivery notifications now.

All my friends from college have their own lives. We have a group chat but nobody really uses it anymore. I'll post something sometimes and get a few reactions but no real responses.

I thought about reaching out to people individually but then what do I even say? ""Hey we haven't talked in two years but I'm lonely want to hang out?"" That's pathetic.

The loneliness is different now than it used to be. It's not like painful anymore, it's just... empty? Like I'm going through the motions of life but there's no connection to anything.

I've been trying to fix this. Joined a gym, started going to coffee shops instead of making coffee at home, been doing practice conversations with gleam and reading books about communication skills. But I feel like I'm preparing for opportunities that never actually come.

1o761s9,https://www.reddit.com/r/branding/comments/1o761s9/where_is_cadbury_bytes/,Where is Cadbury bytes?,"Yesterday, I Spotted Haldiram’s Peeloz… And My Heart Sank

There I was, standing in front of the snack aisle, staring at a bright packet of Haldiram’s Peeloz for Rs. 10. Those familiar little wafer pillows looked back at me, and suddenly I was transported back to 2007—clutching my pocket money, racing to the corner store after school.

But these weren’t what I was looking for.

Where is Cadbury Bytes?

For every 90s kid and early 2000s teenager in India, Cadbury Bytes wasn’t just a snack—it was a ritual Those tiny, crunchy wafer pillows filled with creamy Cadbury chocolate were our GOAT snack (yes, someone literally called it that on Reddit). At just Rs. 5 for an 18-gram pack, it was the perfect intersection of affordability and indulgence.

I still remember the tagline: “Snacking ka Meetha Funda”a bold promise that we could ditch our chips and namkeen for something sweeter, crunchier, and infinitely more satisfying.

Cadbury had cracked something magical. They’d created an entirely new category: sweet snacking. Not a chocolate bar. Not a traditional confection. A snack you could share, munch on during a movie, or demolish alone while pretending to study.

The Choco Crunch variant was iconic, but do you remember Coffee, Caramel, and Strawberry? We were spoiled.

So What Happened? Why Did It Vanish?

Here’s where the story gets bittersweet.

January 2010: Kraft Foods acquired Cadbury in a global takeover. What seemed like a corporate formality became a death sentence for beloved local products like Bytes.

The new management had a clear agenda: portfolio rationalization.Translation? Cut the products that don’t scale globally and pour resources into global giants like Oreo and Tang.

Bytes, designed exclusively for India, was suddenly a liability. Despite its cult following—despite a 2019 petition with over 14,000 signatures demanding its return—it didn’t fit the global playbook.

But there was another problem, one that existed even before Kraft entered the picture:

Bytes was operationally unsustainable.

Those perfect little wafer pillows? Incredibly complex to manufacture. The production required specialized lines for wafer baking, precise filling, and high-speed packaging. The result? High defect rates and razor-thin profit margins at the Rs. 5/10 price point. The technical brilliance that made Bytes delightful to eat made it a nightmare to produce profitably.

Even with strong consumer demand and effective marketing (remember that hilarious Theatre TVC?), the numbers didn’t work. Low gross margins, high manufacturing waste, mounting competition from Frito Lays’ savory empire—it was a perfect storm.

By mid-2011, Bytes quietly disappeared from shelves.

The Nostalgia Lives On

Over a decade later, the memory refuses to fade.

On Reddit and Quora, millennials still mourn its loss. One person called Bytes their “Horcrux” a piece of their soul. Another simply wrote: *“I miss this the most.”

Brands like Haldiram’s Peeloz, Bisk Farm Burst, and ITC Candyman Fantastik have tried to fill the void. Peeloz comes closest—same format, same Rs. 10 price, available in Vanilla and Orange. But ask any Bytes loyalist, and they’ll tell you: *it’s just not the same*.

The chocolate filling doesn’t taste quite right. The crunch isn’t as satisfying. The magic is missing.


The Lesson?

Cadbury Bytes is a masterclass in how local innovation can fall victim to global strategy—even when it succeeds with consumers.

It’s also a cautionary tale about the brutal economics of FMCG: a product can have passionate fans, clever marketing, and cultural relevance, but if the unit economics don’t work, survival is impossible. Especially when a corporate restructuring offers the perfect excuse to cut the cord.

And yet, the story doesn’t end in defeat. The fact that competitors like Peeloz thrive in this space proves the category Bytes pioneered was **valid**. The demand was real. The concept worked. What failed was the execution under a multinational structure with misaligned incentives and cost pressures.

So here’s my question for you:

What discontinued product from your childhood do you still crave?

And more importantly—**should Mondelez bring back Cadbury Bytes? With modern manufacturing improvements and perhaps a Rs. 20 premium positioning, could they resurrect this legend and finally give 90s kids the closure we deserve?

1o75z08,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrettyChaos/comments/1o75z08/first_date_with_amanda/,First Date with Amanda,"I checked the time again—6:47 p.m. Seven minutes until I was supposed to leave. My reflection in the mirror didn’t look like someone who was ready for a first date. It looked like someone trying very hard to pretend she was ready.

https://preview.redd.it/egj22ttax0uf1.jpg?width=1728&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b038cb57abdb14d6f68a78504910555fd0eead2

My lipstick was too red. My eyeliner wasn’t even. And my hair, which I’d straightened twice, was already rebelling in tiny curls around my temples. I sighed and muttered to my reflection, “You’re fine, Amanda. You’re just meeting a person. A regular, breathing, probably normal person.”

But my stomach didn’t believe me.

His name was Ethan. We’d met online three weeks ago, on an app I’d downloaded during a moment of reckless optimism. His profile picture had shown a guy with dark hair, glasses, and a grin that seemed caught between shy and confident. He’d messaged me first—something about the book I’d mentioned in my bio, *The Night Circus*. He actually knew it. That was a good start.

Now, here I was, trying to calm my nerves as if I hadn’t already imagined every possible scenario: he’s shorter than his pictures, he’s secretly married, he’s not actually Ethan but some guy named Jerry who lives in a basement.

I grabbed my bag, took a deep breath, and headed out.

The café was only ten minutes away. It was the kind of place people picked for first dates—neutral, public, safe. My heart thudded against my ribs as I walked in, scanning the room for the man whose photos I’d stared at far too long.

And then I saw him.

https://preview.redd.it/7dspqfbgx0uf1.jpg?width=1728&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bbfedf77843a16840a68d1342d4b54ec44f32321

He was sitting near the window, scrolling on his phone, a coffee already half-finished in front of him. When he looked up, I recognized him instantly—same glasses, same half-smile. Relief flooded through me like a wave. He stood as I approached.

“Amanda?” he asked, his voice warmer than I expected.

“That’s me,” I said, forcing a smile. “You must be Ethan.”

“In the flesh,” he said with a grin that made my nerves settle, just a little.

We ordered another round of coffees and sat down. For the first few minutes, conversation came out in polite, cautious bursts. He asked about my job, I asked about his. I fiddled with the edge of my cup, trying to keep my hands from trembling.

“You okay?” he asked, tilting his head slightly. “You seem… a little nervous.”

I laughed, embarrassed. “Is it that obvious?”

“Only because I was the same way ten minutes ago,” he said. “I almost spilled my coffee waiting for you.”

That made me smile—really smile—and something inside me began to loosen.

The conversation grew easier. He told me about his obsession with old vinyl records, how he spent too much money on used bookstores, and how his sister once convinced him to dye his hair blue in high school. I told him about my dog, Luna, and how she once ate an entire chocolate cake (and survived, miraculously).

We started laughing, really laughing, and before I knew it, an hour had passed. I realized I’d stopped thinking about how I looked, or whether I was saying the right thing. I was just… there. Talking.

When the café started dimming its lights for closing, he smiled. “Well, I guess that’s our cue.”

We walked outside together, the evening air cool and soft. There was that awkward moment—every first date has one—where neither person wants to say goodbye just yet.

“I had a really nice time,” I said, meaning it.

“Me too,” he replied, rubbing the back of his neck. “Would you, uh, want to do this again sometime?”

“Yeah,” I said before I could stop myself. “I think I’d like that.”

He smiled, and it wasn’t the grin from his profile—it was better. Real, a little nervous, and completely genuine.

As I drove home, I caught sight of myself in the rearview mirror. My lipstick had faded, my eyeliner was still uneven, and I didn’t care. The nerves were gone, replaced by something quieter and steadier—hope.

You realize quickly that these funds pay pennies on the dollar. The RPMs (revenue per thousand views) are incredibly low, especially for short-form content. It's a volume game that's almost impossible for an individual to win in any meaningful way.

The real danger is that it subtly changes how you create. You start chasing the kind of empty, viral views that the fund rewards instead of building a loyal community or a real business.

1o75w1j,https://i.redd.it/80rpjl85q8vf1.jpeg,RP: can someone/anyone help me find this novel? No ppp app$$$$$$$$$$,"

Chapter 1 
The soft glow of my laptop screen illuminated Duke's face in my dimly lit dorm room. His expression was unfamiliar—cold, calculating, nothing like the boy I'd grown up with or the man I'd given myself to. My fingers trembled against my collarbone, a nervous habit I'd developed since our relationship intensified during junior year. 
""I need you to withdraw from the scholarship competition,"" he said, his voice devoid of emotion as he turned the laptop toward me. 
The screen displayed a video of us together—intimate moments I thought were private, sacred. My stomach lurched as I realized what he was implying. 
""Duke, what are you doing?"" My voice sounded small, even to my own ears. 
""It's simple, Elizabeth."" He leaned forward, his eyes never leaving mine. ""Withdraw from the competition so Salem can win. Otherwise, these videos go public. Your choice."" 
I stared at him, unable to process the betrayal. This was the man who'd held me through countless nights, who'd promised me forever just months ago. 
""You can't be serious,"" I whispered, but the determination in his eyes told me he was. 
""Deadly serious."" He closed the laptop with a decisive click. ""You have until tomorrow morning to make your decision. Don't make me do something we'll both regret."" 
The threat hung in the air between us, heavy and suffocating. I couldn't breathe, couldn't think straight. The scholarship meant everything to me—my ticket to a future I'd been working toward for years. 
* * * 
Three hours later, I found myself wandering campus in a daze. The autumn air bit at my skin, but I barely noticed. My mind kept replaying Duke's ultimatum, each repetition more painful than the last. 
I needed space to think, to breathe. The campus was quiet at this hour, most students either studying or sleeping. I headed toward the humanities building where there was a twenty-four-hour study lounge. 
As I approached, I heard Duke's voice coming from the phone booth outside. I froze, instinctively stepping into the shadows. 
""I know, baby, I know,"" he was saying, his tone completely different from the coldness he'd shown me earlier. ""It's just a complication I need to handle."" 
My heart stopped. Baby? 
""Salem, you're the one I want. You're the one I've always wanted."" His voice was tender, loving—the voice I thought belonged to me alone. ""Once Elizabeth withdraws, we can stop pretending. I promise you a future together."" 
The world tilted beneath my feet. Not only was he blackmailing me, but he was in love with Salem—the very person who would benefit from my withdrawal. 
""Just a little longer,"" he continued. ""She's just a complication I need to handle. Once this is over, it's you and me."" 
I pressed my hand against my mouth to stifle a sob. The scholarship, the videos—it had all been a calculated move to clear his path to Salem. 
* * * 
Back in my dorm room, I made my decision with surprising clarity. I wouldn't give him the satisfaction of controlling me. I wouldn't let him destroy what remained of my dignity. 
I opened my laptop and navigated to the scholarship portal. With shaking hands, I typed my withdrawal letter, citing personal reasons. Each word felt like glass in my throat, but I forced myself to continue. 
Next, I booked a one-way ticket to Paris—a city I'd always dreamed of visiting but never thought I'd see so soon. My father had given me an emergency credit card for situations ""beyond your control."" This certainly qualified. 
I packed quickly, methodically—just one suitcase containing essentials and my sketchbook. Everything else could be replaced. As I zipped it closed, I caught sight of the painting I'd been working on for months—a self-portrait showing my progression from darkness to light. I hesitated only briefly before leaving it behind. It no longer represented who I was becoming. 
At dawn, I slipped out of campus with nothing but my suitcase and the determination to rebuild myself far from Duke's reach. As the taxi pulled away from campus, I didn't look back. 
The airport buzzed with early morning travelers as I approached the check-in counter. My hands were steady now, my resolve firm. I handed over my passport and credit card with a smile that surprised even me. 
""Destination?"" the agent asked. 
""Paris,"" I replied, the word tasting like freedom on my tongue. 
As I boarded the plane hours later, I felt something unexpected—not fear or regret, but a strange sense of anticipation. Duke had tried to break me, to reduce me to nothing. Instead, he'd set me free. 
I settled into my seat as the plane began to taxi down the runway. Through the window, I watched America—and my old life—fall away beneath me. Somewhere below, Duke was probably just discovering my withdrawal from the competition. By the time he realized I was gone, I would be an ocean away, beyond his reach forever. 
Or so I thought.
Chapter 2 
The Parisian rain drummed against my window, matching the hollow rhythm in my chest. I'd been in this tiny Montmartre apartment for three weeks, and the walls were beginning to close in. My fingers traced the familiar path to my collarbone—a nervous habit that had intensified since Duke's betrayal. 
I hadn't bothered to unpack my suitcase completely. What was the point? This wasn't home; it was just a place to hide. 
My phone buzzed on the nightstand. I ignored it. Another message from my father, probably wondering why I'd abandoned everything. How could I explain that staying would have meant watching Duke parade around with Salem while his threats hung over my head like a guillotine? 
The bakery downstairs had become my only destination. Madame Laurent's croissants were the only thing that made my stomach cooperate these days. ""You're too thin, ma ch�rie,"" she'd said yesterday, her eyes crinkling with concern. ""Paris has many beautiful things, but they cannot fill an empty heart."" 
I hadn't responded. What could I say? That my heart wasn't empty—it was shattered into pieces too small to reassemble? 
The panic attacks came without warning. Sometimes while trying to sleep, sometimes while staring out at the rain-soaked streets. My chest would tighten, my breathing would accelerate, and images of Duke's cold eyes would flash before me. The videos. The scholarship. Salem's name on his lips. 
I'd collapse wherever I was—floor, bed, once even in the middle of Carrefour while trying to buy coffee. The medication I'd been prescribed back home was running out, but I couldn't face a French doctor. Couldn't face explaining myself in broken French while trying to hold back tears. 
""Vous avez besoin d'aide,"" a woman at the café had said last week, her eyes kind beneath silver-streaked hair. She'd pressed a card into my hand. Dr. Margot Dubois, Psychologue. 
I'd thrown it away. Then retrieved it from the trash an hour later. 
Dr. Dubois's office was nothing like the sterile, beige-toned therapist's office back home. It was warm, with mismatched furniture and walls lined with books. She herself was perhaps fifty, with kind eyes that crinkled at the corners when she smiled. 
""Tell me why you came to Paris, Elizabeth,"" she said in lightly accented English. 
I couldn't answer. My throat closed up, and tears spilled down my cheeks. 
""Some wounds cannot be spoken of immediately,"" she said gently. ""Perhaps we can try something different."" 
She led me to a small room adjacent to her office, where an easel stood by a window overlooking a courtyard. ""Sometimes the hands remember what the mind tries to forget. Try to paint what you feel."" 
I stared at the blank canvas, paralyzed. Dr. Dubois placed a brush in my hand and stepped back. 
""Just begin,"" she said softly. 
The first stroke was tentative, then another. Dark colors emerged—black, deep blue, crimson splashes that looked like blood. My hand moved almost without conscious direction, creating chaotic swirls and jagged lines. 
Two hours later, I stepped back from the canvas, exhausted but somehow lighter. The painting was terrible—a mess of dark emotions given form—but something had shifted inside me. 
""That's where Vincent might help,"" Dr. Dubois said, studying my work. ""He owns an art supply shop near Sacré-Cœur. He sees beauty in broken things."" 
The next day, I found myself pushing open the door to Vincent Chen's shop. Bells jingled overhead, and the scent of turpentine and fresh paint greeted me. An elderly Asian man looked up from behind the counter, his eyes sharp despite his age. 
""Ah, Dr. Dubois sent you,"" he said, his French accent thick. ""You have pain in your hands."" 
I glanced down at my raw, paint-stained fingers. 
""Here,"" he said, placing a different brush in my palm. ""Try this one. Sometimes changing tools changes perspectives."" 
He didn't ask why I was there or what had happened to me. He simply showed me different techniques, different ways to channel emotion onto canvas. 
""The darkest colors often contain the most light,"" he said, demonstrating how to mix black with just enough white to create depth. ""Your darkness has purpose, Mademoiselle Elizabeth. Do not fear it."" 
As I left his shop that evening, rain still pattered on the cobblestones, but for the first time since arriving in Paris, I didn't hurry to escape it. Something had awakened inside me—something that felt dangerously like hope. 
But as I climbed the stairs to my apartment, my phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number: ""Did you really think you could hide from me forever?"" 
My blood ran cold. Duke had found me.
Chapter 3 
The rain in Paris had become my constant companion, much like the shadows that followed me from America. I stood at my easel in Vincent's shop, watching dark blues and grays bleed into each other on my canvas. Three months had passed since I'd fled to Paris, yet the wound Duke had inflicted still felt raw. 
""You're holding your breath again, Elizabeth,"" Vincent observed, his voice gentle as he approached with a cup of tea. ""Art requires air, just like life."" 
I exhaled shakily, accepting the steaming cup. ""I keep thinking I'll wake up and this will all have been a nightmare."" 
""Some nightmares leave marks,"" he said, gesturing to my painting. ""But see here? You've added cobalt blue this time. Last week it was all black."" 
I studied the canvas. He was right. A thin line of blue cut through the darkness, like a knife of hope. I hadn't consciously chosen that color—it had simply appeared beneath my brush. 
* * * 
Meanwhile, thousands of miles away, Salem Herrera sat across from Duke in the university café, her dark eyes narrowed with suspicion. 
""It doesn't make sense,"" she insisted, stirring her untouched coffee. ""Elizabeth wouldn't just disappear like this. And her withdrawal from the competition was sudden."" 
Duke's smile didn't reach his eyes. ""People change their minds, Salem. Maybe she realized she wasn't qualified."" 
""That's not Elizabeth."" Salem's voice hardened. ""She worked for that scholarship for years. And she never mentioned having any doubts about her portfolio."" 
Duke leaned forward, his charm sliding into place like a well-worn mask. ""Are you questioning my judgment about Elizabeth? Or about the scholarship committee's decision?"" 
The subtle threat in his tone made Salem pause. She'd seen glimpses of Duke's manipulative side before, but something about his dismissal of Elizabeth's disappearance felt calculated. 
""I'm just saying it's strange,"" she persisted, though less confidently now. 
""Let's focus on your future,"" Duke said, reaching for her hand across the table. ""You earned this opportunity."" 
Salem allowed the touch but couldn't shake the feeling that her scholarship was tainted somehow. 
* * * 
My French had improved enough to order coffee and pastries without embarrassment. Madame Laurent beamed when I correctly asked for a croissant au chocolat one morning. 
""Très bien, ma ch�rie!"" she exclaimed, her eyes crinkling with delight. ""You're becoming a true Parisienne!"" 
I laughed—actually laughed—for what felt like the first time in months. The sound surprised me so much that I clutched my collarbone in shock. 
Later that day, I ventured to the Musée d'Orsay. The grand building's soaring ceilings and natural light created a sense of space I hadn't felt in ages. I wandered through galleries of Impressionist paintings, losing myself in colors and light that seemed to dance on canvas. 
Standing before Monet's water lilies, I felt tears well up unexpectedly. The painting captured light breaking through darkness, transforming ordinary water into something magical. 
""Beautiful, isn't it?"" a woman beside me murmured in accented English. 
""Yes,"" I whispered, unable to explain how the painting mirrored my own journey. 
Back at Vincent's shop the next day, I found myself reaching for a tube of yellow paint—a color I hadn't touched since arriving in Paris. 
* * * 
Duke slammed his office door, scattering papers across the floor. The private investigator's latest report lay open on his desk, accompanied by photographs that made his blood boil. 
Elizabeth in a Parisian café, laughing with an elderly woman. 
Elizabeth entering an art supply shop, her face animated as she spoke with the owner. 
Elizabeth at a museum, standing too close to a tall man who was pointing out something in a painting. 
""She's replacing me,"" he muttered, his fingers crumpling the edges of the photos. ""After everything we had."" 
His phone buzzed with a text from Salem: ""We need to talk."" 
Duke ignored it, focusing instead on the surveillance images. The investigator had been thorough—Elizabeth's address, her daily routines, the people she interacted with. 
""She thinks she can just walk away,"" he whispered, his eyes fixed on a particular photo where Elizabeth was smiling at someone off-camera. ""She thinks she can heal without me."" 
His hand moved to his laptop, fingers hovering over the keyboard. Those videos were still his insurance policy—his way back into her life when the time was right. 
""She'll come back,"" he assured himself, his voice hardening with determination. ""They always come back."" 
What Duke didn't know was that across the ocean, I was finally beginning to breathe again—and with each breath, the grip of his control weakened just a little more",2,1760518758.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

IAmInAPickle · 13/10/2025 14:58

I am 26, I have a stable job and my own house so that doesn’t have a bearing on the situation I am in.

My ex and I (I’ll call him Leo for the sake of this post) broke up a year ago. It was entirely mutual, because we were both too busy to dedicate enough time to our relationship. We’d been together for two years and it honestly broke my heart. We were both just as upset and heartbroken as each other, but we knew it had to happen because we just weren’t good partners for each other. He has always felt like my “what could have been”, he was the right person at the wrong time.

About twelve weeks ago, I met up with a friend (I’ll call him Adam) for coffee. Adam mentioned quite off the cuff that he had always liked me and wanted to take me on a date. I agreed, because I really liked him too and decided it would be fun.

After a couple of dates it became clear that the limit of our relationship was lust, and wouldn’t become romantic.

We ended up in a sort of friends with benefits situation and it was all good, until I realised that I’ve missed my period. I’ve done a test and it’s positive, and I think I’m about four weeks.

I’ve told Adam and he has said the ball is entirely in my court. If I want the baby, he will step up and we can coparent. If I don’t, he’ll support that.

I was leaning towards keeping the baby until Leo texted me and said he misses me, he wants to give things another go and he is serious about me. This has really thrown my head into a scramble.

i don’t know what I’m hoping to achieve by posting this and I guess I just need some sort of advice because I don’t know what to do

  




**Starlight1984 · Yesterday 10:19**

This sounds like something from a Hallmark movie.

Literally an hour and a half before you posted this you didn't know what to do. Then all of a sudden you've met up with ""Leo"" at the pub, told him the entire story of ""Adam"" and the baby and he's fully supportive of everything and wants to make a go of it with you?!

Even though you're pregnant with someone else's baby?!

All whilst working two jobs - one as a lawyer in the city (who only works 3 days a week despite being 26 and only just qualified)?!

**Lotsnlotsoflove · Yesterday 14:25**

I think mumsnet should look into this thread because there is so much that doesn't add up here:

* Considering a termination because an ex got in touch
* City lawyer with flex at 26
* Mortage in London at 26 on a 3 day a week salary
* Ex miraculously wants to give it a go despire pregnant with someone else's child

..... er. Ok.

Posters are questioning the city law on 3day week & side hustle as it’s not the norm 3yr post qualifying. It really isn’t.You would normally be immersed in career with training contract & appraisals. Not giving up steady career,money and progression for a side hustle  
3 day week in a lawyer I’m thinking solo practitioner family firm above a retail outlet on zone 6. Doing conveyance.

are you Nepo lawyer? Swishing about in family firm?

Bit worrying to me that in the space of 24 hours,you've gone from referring to 'the baby' and that 'not once did I say I was considering an abortion' to 'the embryo' and 'not a living thing'.

I work at Circle K, and sometimes customers come up with an empty cup (like a Froster, Polar Pop, or coffee cup) and say they only want the cup — not the drink. My manager told me that I have to charge them for the cup no matter what, even if they don’t fill it.

But a lot of customers get mad when I do that, saying, “It’s just an empty cup!”

So I just want to know — is this the same policy everywhere? Do you guys also charge for empty cups? Or is there a specific PLU or exception for this situation?

We don’t fight but got off to a very bad start and never really recovered from it. Just a couple of visits after we first met, she said that I seemed ‘surprisingly well read for a janitor’s son.’

Whenever I visit my dad, she and I usually ignore each other. But yesterday, I backed her up in an argument. My dad was about to give their dog Jack coffee when she shouted at him, telling him dogs shouldn’t have the stuff. He agreed to not give Jack the coffee but tried to downplay the risk and said to me ‘You’ve never heard anything about not giving dogs coffee, right?’ 

As painful as it was for me to agree with her, I told him that I once went to a dog cafe with my friends and the waitress explicitly told us not to let the dogs have any coffee.

He still said it can’t be that bad for them so I pointed out that if she and I are in agreement about something, then maybe he is wrong about it. Dad was very upset and later told me that she and I shouldn’t have ganged up on him in his own house.

In Tuesday’s entry he wrote, ""today I’m grateful for the way you look at me when I nail a joke."" he never talks like that to me. I scrolled and saw an Uber receipt for 18.42 to her place at 1.13 am after he told me he fell asleep early. The air in my kitchen smelled like burnt toast and my hands shook, I could hear the fridge buzz. He says it is platonic, that her therapist asked her to build gratitude with someone safe. Then why the secret page and why only on his iPad. He bought her a 39 candle from Bath and Body and wrote that it smells like her apartment. Am I being insane or is this emotional cheating.

1o75kfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1o75kfy/queen_turned_to_shreck/,Queen turned to Shreck,"Hi, am I going insane because of the hormones?!

For context - I (27f) and my husband (29m) have been together for almost 7 years, we have a beautiful baby boy (4months) and we are the regular couple, we fight sometimes but we are going strong.

This year was a whirlwind, we got married in May and I gave birth in June.

Now onto the story itself, while my mil makes everyone think that she adores me, I know better.

I gave birth in June, we agreed that for the first 2 weeks my mom will come and help me (thank you heavens for this woman) and then my mil will come for 1 week (this is when shit started to go down)

My mom left and my mil came in on Sunday.

- Monday - Day 1 - we woke up, I was sleep deprived as shit and my hormones were all over the place, trust me sis, rage is an understatement, in terms of what I felt, anyway, while my hubbs was at home, my mil kept asking me what to do, what to cook bla bla, THE SECOND, and I mean the second my hubbs got out of the apartment, she said she is tired and she is going to take a nap (oh don’t mind me and my monstruos black under eyes, by all means go fucking nap) she went in MY BED and slept for 2 freaking hours (quite a coma if you ask me, but you do you bestie) she woke up and gone was the “what should I cook” in came the demand that she wants pizza for dinner, ok sis, we will get pizza for dinner, she put her ass on the couch and started watching the good doctor while I cleaned the house when the baby was asleep and kept on taking care of him when he was awake. Gone was day 1
 - Tuesday Day 2 - I woke up, my hubbs took the baby so I can shower and drink a sip of coffee while she once again started asking what to do today, my husband told her she can clean around the house so I can get some sleep while the baby is sleeping. 
None of it done, i fell asleep at one point and she came in and asked me (yelled) are you sleeping? I WAS thank you very much, she plopped back on the couch and kept on watching her show.
- Day 3 - i locked myself in the bedroom since my temple vain was dancing conga and I was afraid I might not get away with murder even if I was 3 weeks postpartum, she drank 6 coffees a day, smoked outside and came back in crying because it was hot outside (well no shit sherlock, it’s June) and kept on watching that damn show while I kept on doing my thing with my baby. The evening came when my husband came from work and the second she heard the door, she was up on her feet and yelling after me, oh sweetheart, are you mad at me? You didn’t speak a word to me today 
That was the moment I called my hubbs over and had a breakdown where I told him get this freaking woman out of the house or I swear I will strangle her.
Even if he was tired, he saw me and believed I was done and took her out, they came back a few hours later and she started to go on and on about how her son took her out to eat in the city bla bla (little did she know that he did me the biggest favor in the world) 
I will leave aside all the snarky comments on how I take care of my son, that I bathe him too much (every day) or that I fucking moisturize him too much bla bla.
- Day 4 - Shit started to get real, she didn’t do shit to help me, she kept asking to hold the baby when he was falling asleep or eating and she kept on bugging him even if I specifically asked her to not hold him after she smoked unless she changed her clothes, anyway, I was done so I told my husband that I want her out now and we bought her a plane ticket for the next morning so she can fucking leave me be.
The evening came and I knew my hubbs had a tiring day at work (he is a hairstylist and he was gone for 12 hours) so I wanted to cook something for him, when my husband came through the door, I was in the kitchen cooking with the baby in my arms, while my mil was on season 3 of the good doctor, living her best life on my couch. He lost it and told her that he thought she is coming in to help me not on holiday, and she started crying saying that I am not allowing her to do anything and my husband just told her straight up that she shouldn’t ask me anything, she should just do something.
We ate in awkward silence, she made a remark “pasta, this late?” And I just said you weren’t on a diet on monday when you wanted pizza, anyway, once we were done eating, she told me and I quote
“Can you wash these clothes for me since tomorrow I am going home, I need them clean” I LOST IT, but I didnt have a chance to say something because my hubbs but in and asked her if she is paralyzed or something and that she can freaking turn in a washing machine, she just dramatically said that she doesn’t know how to work my washing machine because it is too complicated 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 f*ck me sideways 
She was leaving the next day at 5 am and I was beyond excited, until she came in our room and told me “Can you set an alarm at 4:30 to wake me up?” 
I told her that if the baby will wake up around that time, I will wake her up, the baby woke up at 3:30 so at 4, when I wanted to go back to sleep, I went to wake her up and guess fucking what, she looked at me, looked at the clock and told me with a straight face that she told me to wake her at 4:30, not 4….I just left and went back to sleep without saying goodbye or anything.

Now, its been 3 months since then and we are still not talking however she keeps on telling her son that she doesn’t understand what she did wrong and why I keep shutting her out.

So now my question is, am I being crazy?! 
Should I just talk to her like nothing happened? 
As a side note, since the baby was born, she never called me even to ask to see the baby or to ask me anything about me or him, so that shows me she doesn’t give a crap.

1o75eb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1o75eb3/he_cant_see_her_facebut_he_can_hear_every_step/,He can’t see her face—but he can hear every step she takes. My gothic marriage romance Married to the Blind Heir is out now.,"I married into my lady’s place, stepping into a life meant for someone else—a life tied to the Caldwell heir, blind and rumored to be dying.

On my wedding night, the world felt both new and terrifying. The room was silent, my breath catching as someone entered. He knelt, fingers cool and steady as he slipped the bells around my ankle, the faint jingle echoing in the silent room. My skin prickled with a sudden, sharp panic—memories of being marked before flashed through my mind: Mrs. Porter’s hand gripping my wrist, the invisible chains of servitude I thought I’d left behind. Now, this. I tried to swallow the dread as the bells settled, binding me with sound.

I thought maybe it was just caution—he couldn’t see, after all. But every night after, he found the bells himself, striking them so they never stopped ringing, their constant jingle a reminder that I was never truly alone.

I couldn’t help myself—I asked, ""Didn’t they say the heir apparent was gravely ill and wouldn’t live long? Why is he so energetic?""

His empty eyes suddenly sharpened. He brushed aside the sweat-dampened hair on my forehead, his palm lingering a moment too long, steady and warm. ""Don’t worry. Your husband will never let you become a widow.""

A shiver ran down my spine. The words were a promise and a warning all at once. The dim-lit room felt smaller, the air heavy with something unspoken. His touch was gentle, but it unsettled me—a comfort that felt more like a claim.

The Caldwell manor’s foyer smelled faintly of lemon polish and old money, the American flag fluttering on the porch, and a row of SUVs parked out front. The wedding date loomed. Ethan Caldwell—the Caldwell estate’s heir—had fallen ill, lost his sight, and the whole of Lucas County whispered that he wouldn’t last the year. Even the cashiers at Target gossiped about it, voices low as they bagged groceries for the Porters.

Mr. and Mrs. Porter couldn’t bear to see their only daughter trapped, but they couldn’t break off the engagement either. In the end, they shoved me into her place.

I still remember that morning—Mrs. Porter’s shrill voice slicing through the kitchen, Mr. Porter pacing with his mug of black coffee, unable to meet my eyes. They spoke of opportunity, but it felt more like being led to slaughter.

My nerves jangling, I climbed into the Caldwell family’s wedding limousine, completed a bizarre ceremony involving a live rooster, and was swept into the bridal suite.

The car smelled like new leather and pine air freshener. The driver, a stoic man in a crisp suit, didn’t glance my way. The Caldwell manor loomed, three stories of brick and ivy, American flags flanking the porch, a line of black SUVs out front. Someone pressed a live rooster into my trembling hands—some old superstition—and then I was ushered inside. The suite was cold, sunlight filtered through gauzy curtains, everything too clean and perfect.

After a while, the backyard noise faded, replaced by distant laughter and the clink of glasses—a reminder that for the guests, life would go on. I listened to engines pulling away, the house settling around me.

The door creaked open. Polished black dress shoes stopped at the threshold, gleaming beneath the lamplight. The air shifted—a hint of expensive cologne, fresh and edged with cedar, drifted in.

He lifted my white bridal veil, revealing a youthful face. Ethan Caldwell was only a few years older than me, but he looked even younger—clean-shaven, skin smooth, lips set in a firm line. I’d expected a dying man, but he looked like he belonged in a college football ad, not a hospital.

""Are you Ethan Caldwell?""

""I am not."" His voice was cold as January. He crouched before me, his tone suddenly softer: ""Sorry about this. I know it’s weird.""

His words were clipped, but less formal than I expected. I felt a chill as he knelt, deliberate and careful.

He knelt, fingers cool and steady as he slipped the bells around my ankle, the faint jingle echoing in the silent room. The metal was icy against my skin. His hands worked with practiced gentleness, but I felt exposed—tagged, as if ownership had changed hands.

""What are you doing?""

""The heir apparent can’t see. He can only find people by sound.""

He spoke like it was nothing, as if he’d just mentioned the weather. I pictured him moving through these endless halls, tracking me by the sound of bells.

He stood and vanished out the door—a whisper of movement, footsteps barely audible on the hardwood.

I looked down. The bells were locked around my ankle; I couldn’t take them off. Every time I shifted, they jingled softly—a constant reminder of my new place.

It felt strangely intimate, almost possessive. I wondered how long I’d have to wear them, how long I’d be someone’s marked property.

I suppose it made sense—strangers forced to share a bed. I’d heard before that Ethan Caldwell had been a force in local politics, shrewd and calculating, the kind of guy who could charm donors at a country club brunch.

There were whispers about backroom deals, strategic campaign dinners—he’d been the type to shake every hand, sizing up friends and rivals. Was all that really gone now?

Maybe he was just being careful.

After that man left, no one else came. I leaned against the headboard and closed my eyes.

I don’t know how long passed before I felt a feather-light brush on my cheek.

The room had grown cold; a draft made me shiver beneath the heavy comforter. The touch jolted me awake, heart thudding.

I opened my eyes—his face was close. He wore a white tuxedo jacket, sharp brows drawn low, eyes empty and uncertain.

A flicker of uncertainty flashed across his face, but his jaw set with determination. For a second, I glimpsed the confidence he must have worn before all this.

""Heir apparent?""

He curled his lips. ""Wife, you’ve waited long.""

His voice was low, but carried a quiet authority. For a heartbeat, I almost forgot he couldn’t see me at all.

Though Ethan Caldwell was blind, his hair was neatly styled, his features striking, his bearing dignified. He didn’t look like a dying man at all.

There was something about the way he sat—shoulders squared, hands folded—that said he was still in command of his fate, not just waiting to die.

""Wife, are you tired?"" He tipped his head, as if listening for my answer in the quiet.

His presence wrapped around me, cool but not cold. The faint scent of his cologne—crisp, citrusy—mixed with clean linen. The mattress dipped, and I felt caught between leaning in and running away.

After a moment, Ethan’s striking face turned toward me. By candlelight, his eyes, once dull, seemed to catch the light, as if he could see me after all.

Maybe it was a trick of the shadows—or maybe it was just the force of his attention.

I swallowed. ""Husband, it’s time for the wedding night.""

The words sounded braver than I felt. My heart thundered, the weight of expectation pressing down like summer heat before a storm.",1,1760516783.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

I am writing with deep frustration regarding the appalling service my family and I experienced on two of our recent Emirates flights on 20th sept 2025: EK066 (STN–DXB) and EK570 (DXB–CCU).

On EK066, service was late, meals were served without preference, trays remained uncleared for over 90 minutes, and requests for drinks and juices were flatly denied—while the crew served other passengers. The crew was discourteous, the bathroom left in a mess by staff, and we received no menu card. Food was poorly prepared, and only popcorn was offered as a snack.

On EK570, we were denied the non-veg breakfast we requested, and when escalated, the supervisor rudely stated he was giving us his “meal out of pity,” which was stale. They denied our requests for coffee and bread. My 70-year-old father was refused help with his luggage. Crew members ignored our call button for 45 minutes, told us to “adjust” our seats when others occupied them, and made us stand while they chatted. The overall behavior was discriminatory and dismissive.

Frankly, we are shocked. Emirates prides itself on hospitality, yet we faced racism, rudeness, and negligence—treatment unworthy of any airline, let alone Emirates.

We demand:

An urgent explanation for this unacceptable service.

Strict action against the staff responsible.

Immediate escalation to a senior manager, with whom we expect to speak on priority.

A fair compensation for the harassment.

We are frequent international travellers and have always valued Emirates, but after this incident, our trust has been severely shaken. Unless this matter is addressed promptly and satisfactorily, we will have no choice but to reconsider flying with Emirates in the future and escalate this further.

I have been struggling with a lack of energy, body weight and more or less mild depression for years. But recently I found something that has an amazing effect on me. It's well-known to this sub, but I only came to try it myself a few weeks ago: Sauerkraut juice – fermented and non-pasteurized of course.

I just buy it at the local store, drink half a glass in the morning before breakfast, go to the bathroom a few minutes later and feel just great for the whole day. Nothing else – no coffee, no meds. I feel awake even when the night was short, my mood is up, I'm motivated, concentrated and the house is looking cleaner by now than ever since we've moved in. I've even started to slowly lose weight as any cravings for sweets have completely vanished.

Now, what's happening? I have several theories:

1. The lactic acid bacteria grow in my guts, replacing any other, less helpful or harmful organisms which are then dumped. The LAB then produce a vast amount of serotonin that my body has been lacking before.

2. Tryptophan something something.

3. Something unrelated to the Sauerkraut, maybe a tumor.

Okay, the store just opened, need to get more sauerkraut juice. Just wanted to share this anecdotal evidence with you and maybe someone can benefit from it.",13,1760516376.0,Microbiome,4,1.0,False

1o75ab7,https://i.redd.it/whvqjpvyi8vf1.jpeg,Soundhound is destined for good things today look at this,"Okay picture this: I wake up at exactly 4:19 AM not because I’m disciplined but because my cat stepped on my face and knocked over a glass of water onto my phone which had six alarms set with anime opening songs. As Gurenge blares at half volume from a damp speaker I realize something important. Today is not just any day. Today is SoundHound trading day and my neurons start firing like Goku going Ultra Instinct on a Monday morning.
I make coffee with the confidence of a wine tour guide in Tuscany who absolutely knows nothing about wine but is really good at making up adjectives like sunkissed and grape-forward.As the coffee hits, I walk outside to hear the whispers in the wind telling me things like ""buy the dip"" and ""don’t paper hand this one you coward."" The grass is growing faster than my portfolio and I'm here for it.
I hop onto Reddit, r/soundhound, even that one cursed Discord server that might be run by an AI pretending to be a 19-year-old finance bro named Chad. Everyone’s talking about it. SoundHound. The sleeper cell. The anime filler arc that suddenly matters. The side character with too much backstory to stay irrelevant.
Meanwhile, my brain is high-diving off the cliffs of irrational optimism straight into the lukewarm waters of “YOLO let’s ride.” I feel like I'm on a banana boat strapped to the back of a speedboat called Artificial Intelligence Hype, hanging on for dear life as it drags me through waves of speculative enthusiasm and questionable DD. One bump and I’m out. But until then? I ride.
I imagine Donald Trump accidentally tweeting something bullish about voice AI while trying to complain about Siri, and the ticker shoots up 12% because someone turned it into a meme and suddenly it’s gospel. Somewhere, a hedge fund manager drops his wine and mutters “we underestimated the anime investors again.”
My cousin messages me from Colorado. He’s on a ski lift. He asks if SoundHound is a crypto. I tell him it’s better. It’s voice. It’s vibes. It’s VAs with reverb filters. He shrugs and sends me a picture of a moose. This somehow makes me more bullish.
I open my trading app. My hands are shaking. Not from fear. From the sheer serotonin hit of staring at a green candlestick. It’s moving up. Not a lot. Just enough to make me feel like I’m parasailing over the island of financial freedom with a parachute made of sheer delusion and a harness made of confirmation bias.
Someone in a Telegram group sends an AI-generated image of an elf holding a SoundHound logo and whispering ""HODL"" while standing next to a tipped cow. I don’t even question it. This is the content I need.
A single tear slides down my cheek. Not because I’m emotional. Because I haven’t blinked in 14 minutes watching Level 2 data move like grass in the wind. Gently. Unpredictably. Majestically.
This is it. This is why I’m excited. Because this is no ordinary ticker. This is the main character now. The arc has begun. The music is swelling. The energy is rising. And me?
