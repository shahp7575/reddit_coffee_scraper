1qnkmmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1qnkmmx/cmv_celebrities_should_doing_more_to_support_the/,CMV: Celebrities should doing more to support the Minneapolis protests,"I’ve been having this recurring thought for more than a week now:
Where is Colbert? Will the real Slim Shady please stand up? Isn’t he kind of local? I keep seeing Billie Eilish get headlines for condemning ICE. Same for Greenday. If these people wanted to help, they could actually help.

Why I think they should do more:

Wealth and resources. A single A list celebrity could keep Minneapolis protestors fed and warm for a year without noticing the cost. They could buy donuts, coffee, handwarmers, hotel rooms, medical supplies...all pocket change for them. If they truly stand with these protestors, why not provide material support? Why call it an inflection point from afar, yet stay financially uninvolved? 

Status and celebrity.People like Colbert, Jon Stewart, Kimmel have massive reach. They're politically branded entertainers who already have audiences that lean left. They move culture when they want to. They did more for team coco than this, I swear... And sure, they can’t go on TV and tell people to protest without risking lawsuit but they could surprise everyone, show up for an hour, walk a few blocks with protestors, then go back to work. If the response is positive, do it again. They can take the jet. 


I know these are entertainers, not organizers. But they still wield money, prestige, and a national megaphone. When they spend night after night warning us that “democracy is in danger,” “this is the breaking point,” “now is the time to stand up,” I expect to see them stand somewhere other than behind a desk. Or maybe the hype is bs? I personally don't think so.

Counterpoints...

Colbert has shows to produce. Billie Eilish has albums to finish and a tour that employs hundreds of people. They have families and hobbies to spend time on. They have responsibilities and maybe don't have time.

Also if they physically attend a protest, their presence could escalate the danger for everyone. They don't want to get their fans killed. And if they did, they could probably be held criminally liable (like when Pdiddy caused that stampede) 

Personal Bias..
Maybe this frustration is really fatigue. The deluge of bad news has been grating the past few weeks and I'm feeling less objective. Maybe I’m just tired of being told that protests “matter” by people who don’t seem willing to walk the walk.

Taylor Duncan sat at his desk looking intently at his computer screen. He was looking at a satellite map showing the property he was looking to purchase. He had built his business by taking calculated risk. He was able to see potential where others saw only problems.

He thought of how far he had come since he had moved to California over thirty years ago. Back when he had been dirt poor. Taylor decided at an early age he was going to rise above poverty. He was always thinking about what business he could start. He was living in Spartanburg, SC back then. His mother's latest boyfriend had just died. She went into a deep depression and stopped working. Taylor knew where this was headed as he had been through this so many times before. His mother would move in with her next boyfriend who would be worse than the last and Taylor would bear the abuse of the creep. So at sixteen he decided to drop out of school to start working full time. He would take care of himself. Taylor found a job at a local cotton mill. He hated the job but it kept the rent paid. Taylor felt like he was responsible as he was the only one in the house working so he was covering the bills for everyone else. 

That is when he met his first love, Betsy. She was his landlady's granddaughter. Life was good until Betsy's mother found out they were dating, then it wasn't. The problem was that Betsy's father was well off, owning a few businesses and they lived in the nicest neighborhood in town. Taylor lived in a less desirable area. Actually there were worse neighborhoods but not many. 2 allBetsy's Dad knew they were dating and was OK with it. Taylor worked for him on weekends at his car lot. When Betsy's mother found out she was dating Taylor, she was forbidden from even talking to him. They tried to sneak around for a bit but it didn't work out and they finally broke up. Taylor heard from Betsy's grandmother that Betsy was getting married, to someone her mother approved of obviously.

Taylor thought about it long and hard. He realized that he would never be allowed to progress beyond where he was socially or financially. He wanted so much more, so he decided to move as far away as he could. His sister had asked Taylor to move to Sacramento, CA where she lived so that is where he moved. The only problem was finding a job. He didn't have a diploma since he quit school to work so the first thing he did was get his GED. Next he decided to join the Army for the education benefits. While on active duty he took night courses and received his Associates degree by the time he finished his enlistment. 

By the time Taylor left the Army he was married. Money was tight so Taylor took a second job at a small convenience store. After Taylor had been there for a couple of years, the owner asked him to buy the place. He liked Taylor's work ethic and ambition. The owner had run the place for over forty years and was tired of running it. He would say the place was starting to run him instead. They agreed that instead of paying a down payment, the down would be split over five years. Taylor now owned his first business. 

Taylor was always at the store. He was working all the time he was awake, and he didn't sleep much.
Taylor wanted to put the money back in the business making all the improvements he had in mind, like upgrading everything. His wife wanted to spend the money rather than investing back into the business. Taylor said that he would allow her a set amount of money to spend how she wanted. They did buy the nice house and a car she wanted, but not all the other things she wanted. 

Taylor started to take the products that were about to go out of date and delivered them to people in the neighborhood that were struggling and asked if they could use it? He would rather give it to them than throw it in the garbage. If something came in with torn packaging he would do the same. Mothers loved getting diapers and baby care items. Suddenly the loss due to shoplifting dropped to nearly zero. It was like the entire neighborhood was looking out for him.

Taylor was still working a lot. He noticed that things had shifted at home. It had gone from warm and cozy to cold and critical. Taylor did not go crazy, he just hired a private investigator. He found out that his wife was having affairs. Taylor simply filed for divorce and let the attorneys fight it out. He wound up letting his wife keep the house instead of any future financial support. It was actually a good deal for Taylor. Now she was responsible for the payments. Taylor was still devastated by the divorce, of his wife throwing away what they had. He slowly realized that she wanted more than he could ever give her. She wouldn't be happy no matter how much he gave. 

So instead of being sad and turning to drink and vices, Taylor started to work. He was always at the store so he set up a cot in the back and cleaned up in the employee bathroom. The store had a vacant lot with it when he bought it so he had a building constructed on it. He opened a coffee shop that roasted and ground their own coffee beans on one side and a fish and chips restaurant on the other. The coffee shop was busy from six AM through the late afternoon and the fish and chips would be busy from lunch through early evening. The store was slow from 10 PM to 6 AM. By targeting his most profitable hours and only being open then, he was able to cut his labor and overhead considerably. He soon bought more land and put in more businesses. He lived very modestly and put all his profit back into buying more land and opening more businesses. 

Taylor had read years ago about several successful business owners that started owning the property for all their locations after leasing space that once their initial lease expired, their lease rates would be doubled or tripled. They had been forced to move and the business suffered greatly. So with all of his businesses he insisted on owning the ground and building.That was where the bulk of his wealth came from.

Taylor was helping out at the coffee shop one morning because someone called in sick when he met a nurse who came in for a coffee before she started her shift. Taylor started talking with her when she told him that the sugar was out. Taylor grabbed some from the back and brought it out for her. She complimented the service there and told him “The workers here are so nice, and cute too” while giving him a shy smile. “That is why I come in every day. It gets my day off to a good start.” Taylor told her “Compliments will be rewarded. Your next order will be on me.” She came in the next day and Taylor asked her out on a date. 

Vivian assumed that Taylor was just a worker at the coffee shop and Taylor didn't correct her. On their first date they agreed that due to past experiences they both had any cheating was a complete deal breaker. They felt  if a person wanted to act single, they should be single. 

On their third date, Taylor told Vivian that he was the owner of the coffee shop not just a worker. He explained his philosophy of living simple and investing everything back into the business. Vivian thought that was brilliant. She had seen too many people trying to live above their means and wound up losing what little they actually owned. As long as you have a decent, safe place to live and decent transportation, what more do you really need. Taylor said people are so worried about impressing people that they don't like and the people they are trying to impress don't care about them or care what they have. They had a laugh about that. 

After a year of dating, Taylor and Vivian were married. Vivian continued working as a nurse and Taylor continued building his businesses. He had several chains that he had developed. He had expanded the convenience store to over twenty locations, and did the same with the coffee shop and the fish and chips restaurant.  He also opened a hair salon that offered limited spa services that turned out to be very popular. Then in the coffee shop he heard two mothers discussing how hard it was to find decent childcare. Taylor investigated it and opened a daycare that focused on educating the children, not just babysitting them. The demand was overwhelming and every new location was filled immediately.

One thing he did to keep the employees happy and honest was to take a percentage of the profit from that location and split it among the employees of that location based on how long they worked for the company. He also had a policy to hire from within the company. He would go outside only if there were no qualified people available and the skills required could not be taught in a reasonable time. Taylor had each business operate separately but under the umbrella corporation that had the legal, human resources and accounting for the separate businesses. 

As Taylor reminisced about where he started back in Spartanburg, he zoomed out then zoomed in on Spartanburg. A flood of memories washed over him. He quickly found where the house he used to live in had been. He then found the cotton mill where he worked all those years ago. Except now it was clearly abandoned and the entire neighborhood around the mill was blighted. That caught Taylor's attention. Taylor immediately called his assistant Paul in and showed him the property and told him to get all the information on it that he could. With his assistant busy with that he returned to what he was working on before.
 
Paul reported that the mill had been closed for over a decade. The owners had tried everything to sell it but nobody was interested in it. Taylor suddenly had an idea. Taylor talked to Vivian about what he had in mind. She thought that he should pursue it. Taylor told his assistant the next day that they would be going on a trip to the East Coast the following week. They needed to take a close look at this one. They flew into the Columbia, SC airport. This airport had a kind of special significance for Taylor. This was the airport that he flew out of when he had moved to Sacramento. Now here he was flying back in again. He rented a car and drove north to Spartanburg.

Taylor first toured the mill building. It still had the same layout that he remembered, only now all the massive machines had been removed. Actually this would work well for what he had in mind. Taylor told the agent showing the property that he would have to do his due diligence prior to making any decisions. By the end of the showing, Sara the agent showing the property and Taylor's assistant Paul were openly flirting. 

Taylor had his assistant Paul stay in touch with Sara, always asking for more details on the property. Paul found out the sellers would be open to any offer. Taylor was meeting with  local politicians, and the assessor. Taylor found out that the rate of unemployment was extremely high. The entire neighborhood was declared an Urban Renewal Area which gave Taylor access to perks for taking on the project. He negotiated with the city for tax breaks and improvements to the streets. In return Taylor promised to create at least forty new jobs by the end of the second year to be increased by ten percent each year for the next ten years. 

Taylor decided to use the building for two separate businesses. He had read that a furniture manufacturer in the Sacramento area was closing down after decades. Taylor was familiar with the brand and was impressed with their quality. Taylor contacted the manager of the company. He was hired as the manager for Taylor's new furniture division, Foothills Furniture. The second company was an athletic clothing manufacturing company, Pro Team. His idea was to work directly with schools and the student athletes to customize the uniforms into something the athletes would be comfortable in and excited to wear.  

The reason he decided on two separate companies was if one failed, the other could be ramped up and if they both failed, he could use the space as a warehouse and still fulfill his commitment to the city. Taylor left Paul to supervise the project until the launch while he returned home. Paul had Sara check with all the homeowners in the neighborhood around the mill to find the ones that wanted to sell. Taylor bought all the available homes. He eventually had well over half of all the properties. Most of the homes had to be razed. He then had a contractor build nice solid family homes that looked like cottages. He put in a park to make the area family friendly. He named the area Cottage Park. The homes were offered to his employees at a lower price and with financing that made it a real perk. It became a desirable place to live. The project received attention from the state and nation. The city got a lot of attention in the press which promoted more businesses moving into the city.

Paul and Sara had been maintaining a long distance relationship since Paul had returned to California once the businesses were up and running.  Paul came to Taylor to tell him that he and Sara were talking seriously about getting married. He wanted to move back to Spartanburg permanently and marry Sara. He was giving his notice. Taylor had been thinking about it. So he sat Paul down and said “Paul, you have been with me for a very long time. You started working with me back when you were still in high school working weekends. You have been with me through most of my expansion. You know how I operate as well as I do. I will not be able to replace you. So instead of quitting, would you consider moving to Spartanburg and heading up our East Coast Division? My idea is to establish the businesses we have here in that area and expand on them. Of course we will be buying property so could you check with Sara and see if she could help us with that. 

Both of the businesses that Taylor had put in the mill building took off and Taylor had far surpassed the number of employees required in the agreement in less than half the time allowed. There were over one hundred employees that were working there that were hired from the area. The city and the Chamber of Commerce threw a large dinner for Taylor and he was to be the keynote speaker. Taylor took Vivian with him on this trip. He needed her support and wanted to show her where he was from. Paul had already moved back. 

The dinner in Taylor's honor was the social event of the year for the city. Everyone that was anyone was there. They all wanted to celebrate the turn in the local economy that was benefiting them. As Taylor sat at the head table waiting to speak, the mayor and others gave their speeches about how much this project had benefited the entire area. Slides were shown before and after the transformation. Speeches were given about the economic impact and the media attention it brought and the resulting investments in the entire community. As Taylor scanned the audience he landed on a familiar face. It couldn't be, but when their eyes met there was no denying it. He was looking at Betsy for the first time in over thirty years. The last time they saw each other was when they were only seventeen.

Taylor had to snap out of it. He was being introduced to speak. He started by saying “This didn't start just over five years ago, but it started over thirty years ago. At the time I was an insecure seventeen year old kid but had a fire to succeed. I had more ambition than good sense. There was one man that took notice of me. I would work for him washing and detailing the cars on his car lot on the weekends. He encouraged me and believed in me when not even my own family did. So I want to take this opportunity to publicly thank him for the push he gave me to wind up here today. So I ask each of you to always be like him and look around you for that person that only needs a little guidance, that push to accomplish great things.” He then thanked Betsy's father by name. He went on “My journey started here and I am fully committed to this area so I am opening an East Coast Division that will be based here in Spartanburg and headed up by Paul who many of you have worked with since the start of this project.”

As soon as he could, Taylor told Vivian that Betsy was there, just so she wouldn't be surprised. She knew all about Betsy and her father. Taylor credited them for where he was. After the dinner everyone wanted to shake his hand and thank him for all he did for the city. Then Betsy appeared with a man who turned out to be Tom, her husband. She thanked Taylor for mentioning her Dad by name and mentioned that he  passed several years ago. 

Taylor asked Vivian if she would like to get a coffee with Betsy and her husband? When she agreed he asked Betsy and her husband and they accepted. Paul and Sara joined them at the restaurant.
When they were seated, they were introduced. Sara had been friends with Betsy for years and had helped her with some transactions when Betsy's Dad died. Taylor actually liked Betsy's husband Tom. He was a partner in a local law office. Taylor could tell that Tom was totally in love with Betsy. That was all he wished for Betsy. It was quite a lively conversation.

Taylor asked Betsy what happened with her life? She explained that she had gotten married, but it only lasted a couple of years. After her divorce her Dad insisted that she finish her degree so she could help with his businesses. She wound up receiving an MBA. She met Tom during that time while he was in law school. They married and had three beautiful children. The youngest was now in college. They found out that both couples had been married about twenty-five years, and were still very much in love and very happy together. 

Taylor looked at Tom and said “Please don't take this the wrong way, but Betsy will always be part of my life and my story. Her mother forbade her from talking to me. But that is what gave me the burn to pursue success.”

Taylor continued “I was married then divorced. Then I met Vivian and we have been partners since, just over twenty-five years now. Vivian kept working as a nurse, and I worked with my businesses. We just live a simple life, have nothing flashy, and our neighbors don't really know what I do. I'm always working at my next project.” Taylor looked at Betsy and continued “You were my first love but I was young and foolish and didn't know how to show it or act properly at the time. I truly apologize if I caused you any pain.  But if it hadn't been for you and your Dad, my life would look completely different. So I wanted to thank you for that.”

Betsy looked up “I'm surprised that you remembered me.” Vivian assured her that he still credits her and her Dad for his success. He talks about it often.

Taylor had often thought about what meeting Betsy again would be like. This never came up. He had often thought about them being young and thinking they were going to be together for the rest of their life, only to have that ripped apart. But it was interesting how though they were ripped apart and lived separate lives, their lives followed a similar trajectory. This was so much better than anything he had imagined.

I’m wondering if anyone has had success in areas where the demographics aren’t the typically recommended ones? I live on the outskirts of a major metro area in the Midwest in the US and there are some multi-family housing and apartment complexes, but most apartments here have laundry. That said, I think there’s a huge potential for wash and fold, and mom friends in the area always talk about wanting to wash bigger items. Toying with the idea of a smaller space (15-20 washers plus dryers) and offering W&F services. I would love to also offer a spot where people could grab a coffee or a cocktail, but that’s probably not a good idea in terms of ROI. 

Location would be near shopping (Target, auto shops, grocers, gyms, etc). Would largely market to families. May even offer pickup for service if within a few miles. 

Has anyone had success with this type of model? Thanks! ",1,1769444443.0,Laundromats,0,1.0,False

I woke from my dream with a jolt and a gasp. I sat up and could feel my pulse in my jaw as my heart hammered away in my chest. I took some deep breaths to try and collect myself—it’d just been a dream. A stupid dream. This was Teo’s fault, I thought to myself, him and his damn superstitions just spooked me. That was all. Just a damn nightmare brought on by some scary stories in the dark.

A small fire—embers really— was still crackling and popping by my side and a looked over to see Quillo carefully tending to it.

“Mornin’ boss,” Quillo’s voice was graveled by smoke and phlegm. A wheezing cough jumped out of him, and he caught it with his sleeve. “Well, it’s just about mornin’ at least.”

My body felt like a bundle of dry sticks as I got up and moved around the fire to plop down next to him. Quillo muffled another retching cough in his sleeve as the embers started to lick up the wood he’d stacked together in a little teepee.

“Almost went the whole trip without one of your coughin’ fits.” I crouched forward and blew on the embers to give Quillo’s lungs a break. “Doc ever get you figured out?”

“Nah,” Quillo sat back and took in a labored breath, “he said it ain’t consumption, far as he can tell.”

“Well, God bless that.”

Quillo nodded and folded his arms. He lifted his chin up to the sky and sucked in the cool air. “Same thing took my daddy.”

“C’mon, Quillo.” I said. “Don’t talk like that.”

Quillo shrugged. “Just the truth.” He pulled his walnut pipe seemingly out of thin air, and I could hear the crinkle of paper as he rummaged through his bag of tobacco. “First came the fits.” He packed a pinch of tobacco into his bowl. “Then the fits got worse. Not too long after he was wasting away in bed and there wasn’t a damn thing any of us could do for em.” He struck a match and the bowl glowed orange as he held the flame to it. “Ma would make me bring soup into the room for him, and I remember being so scared to look at him. He was so pale and his face was so sunk in, he looked like some ghoul, not my daddy.”

I didn’t say anything. What could I say? Instead, I just sat there staring at the flames, trying my best to take in what my dear friend was telling me. Quillo pondered on the stars above and gnawed gently on the stem of his pipe.

“I’m dying, Bodie.”

“You don’t know that.”

“Sure do.” Quillo grabbed a stick that was set behind him and started poking at the fire. “Doc said he’d seen cases like mine and like my daddy’s.” He smiled, he almost seemed humored by the whole thing, “Sometimes our parents pass down our deaths to us like they pass down our eye color, that’s what he said.” He muffled another cough into his sleeve.

I suddenly felt furious with Quillo. “Why now? Why the hell did you wait ‘til now to tell me all this?”

“We had a big score,” Quillo turned and grinned at me, “I didn’t want our attention pulled elsewhere. That’s how things slip.” He looked back up at the stars, “now that the job’s done. I can get back to thinking how I’m gonna live out my last days.”

“Enough of that,” I snapped, “When we get back to Santa Fe we’re finding the first train east and we’re getting you the best doctor our money can buy.” I chucked a stick into the fire. “You ain’t dying, not like that.”

There was a long pause there by the fire, and it felt like a thick fog had fallen between me and my old friend. My head was a mess of thoughts as I sat there pulling up twigs and dead grass and tossing them into the fire. By some measure, I owed my life to Quillo and I’m sure he’d say he felt the same if I’d ever had the chance and indecency to ask him. We’d been through it all together and had spent so many nights talking about how one day we’d get that big score and live like gentry. Now here we were with that very score we always dreamed about— and time was short to enjoy it. It wasn’t fair.

“You really thinkin’ about going straight after all this?” Quillo’s voice finally broke through the quiet that sat between us.

I nodded. “Yep.” I laid down with a grunt and shifted down into the dirt until I was comfy. First light was starting to creep up around us wrapping a band of gold around the horizon. “You reckon clean money feels different?”

Quillo chuckled. “Heard it feels like the touch of a good woman.”

I whistled. “Could use some of that.”

We both shared a laugh and Quillo stood to his feet. His joints popped and snapped and he got up and stretched out his back. “S’pose I’ll get breakfast goin’.”

 

V

 

The crackle of the fire was soon joined by the sizzle of sowbelly and the smell of coffee Quillo had brewing in a small cookpot. We wolfed down our breakfast—which included the remaining beans and bread from supper—and we all guzzled down a cupful of gritty coffee. We hadn’t much time to sit and enjoy our meal, being that we wanted to get some miles on our trail before our morning turned into afternoon. The desert heat was merciless, and you could only push men and horses so hard.

After our quick meal we started packing up camp, and it was about then that I noticed Scraps wasn’t quite acting himself. He’d been mouse quiet during breakfast and usually had more than just a thing or two to say. As we loaded up our horses, he remained mute and his face looked haggard like he hadn’t slept a wink. He hadn’t even made sport of Teo when the opportunity presented itself— that’s when I knew something wasn’t right.

“You alright there, Scraps?” I pulled my saddlebag tight and fastened the buckle.

Scraps nodded as he fiddled with his horse’s bit. “Yeah,” he gave the bridle a tug, “I’m alright. Strange dreams is all.”

My skin pricked. “What kinda dreams?”

Scraps looked over at me. He looked pale, sick almost, and his eyes looked like they were sinking back into his skull.

“I don’t much feel like talkin’ ‘bout em, boss.”

The image of Santiago pointing with his rotting finger flashed back into my mind and a chill ran through me. I decided not to press Scraps any further. If his dreams had been anything like mine, I didn’t wanna hear em.

We all gave our tack a good look over then mounted up and started the next leg of our journey. We rode two abreast, with me and Teo in front and Scraps and Quillo taking up the rear. This land had been such a strange place, and I was overjoyed to be putting more miles between me and it.

The ride was quiet. The only sounds were the wind and the steady thump of hooves on sunbaked earth. Usually, these rides were accompanied by one of Scraps whistling tunes, but there were no songs coming from him that day. I figured he’d come around once we got back on the trail, but whatever disturbed him while he slept seemed to still have him in a vise.

After we’d been riding for a few hours, we came to a wide pass with a rocky cliff pecked with sage and Indiangrass on one side, and rolling hills on the other. The pass was nowhere near home, but something about it made me take a breath of relief. I looked back at Scraps, and the feeling quickly vanished. He was riding with his shoulders slumped forward and his eyes blank and fixed on the nape of his horse’s neck—It was just like he’d been in my dream.

“Scraps,” I called out. He hardly budged. “Scraps, how ‘bout you whistle us something?”

Scraps said nothing. It’s like I wasn’t even there. Normally, I’d be furious and smack the stupid out of him, but I could tell something was off and it was making me uneasy.

“Scraps?”

His arms suddenly went limp and the reigns dropped out of his hands. His whole body then went slack and bobbed about with each step his horse took before he slowly slid off the side and hit the ground with a hollow thud.

“Scraps!” The shout leapt out of me and I yanked hard on my reigns, turning my horse around. We all dismounted with sloppy hurriedness and trotted over to our fallen man.

As we all knelt down next to Scraps his body was seized with a violent shiver and his teeth clattered like a man bit by a winter chill. His eyes were wide and distant, and his chest heaved rapidly with sharp, labored breaths.

“Sit em up!” I barked, fearing the worst. I’d seen this kind of affliction before— and it hadn’t ended well. Quillo and Teo pulled Scraps up onto his ass and as his breathing began to settle, so did my nerves. His eyes were still glassy and empty, but he started to finally take note of us with them. He looked at each of us as he got his wits back, and then something over my shoulder caught his attention. His mouth fell open and a fearful look twisted into his face, and then a sound came out of Scraps that I thought I’d never live to hear him make— He *whimpered.* Like a small child in the dark, quivering lip and all.

“I… I’m sorry, boss.” Scraps stammered, his eyes still fixed on whatever it was behind me. “I doomed us.”

*Doomed us?*

My skin pricked.

“The hell you talkin’ ‘bout, Scraps?”

Scraps didn’t answer me. He just continued to stare off into the distance with breathy whimpers. I didn’t dare turn around, despite every inch of my skin begging me to. God knows I didn’t wanna lay eyes on whatever it was that could reduce Tommy “Scraps” Calloway into a pathetic mess like that.

“I seen em,” Scraps whispered, “I seen em, boss. He was mighty angry.” The image of Santiago’s corpse atop that horse flashed back in my mind and I clenched my jaw.

“Who?” I asked, feeling my heart start to furiously dump blood and adrenaline into my veins. “You saw who?”

Scraps didn’t seem to even hear my question. He squirmed and let out a noise I’d only heard men make when they saw me coming and knew it was the end for them. “He didn’t want that soul wandering in his gorge. Said we disrespected him,” he choked down some tears, “Now he wants our blood.” Scraps finally looked at me, “Blood is the only way.”

Scraps was what I would describe as a *man of the world.* He wasn’t one to pay much mind to anything he couldn’t touch or taste or feel. A man of practicality, with a mind far too set in logic to get caught up in ghoulish stories and superstition like the rest of us. So let me tell you, hearing him talk like that iced over my bones and sent gooseflesh running down my arms.

“The only way for what?” I asked. A part of me was waiting for him to suddenly perk up and give me that toothy grin of his. He’d laugh with that high pitched cackle of his and tell us all how stupid we were, then hop back up on his horse, having completed his sick joke.

Scraps started to say something, but then something over my shoulder caught his attention once again. His eyes widened in terror like I’d never seen before and then he broke down into a pitiful sob.

“He’s here. He found us.”

A mix of fear, anger and confusion stirred in my gut, and I grabbed Scraps by the shoulders. “Who!? Who is he!?”

Scraps didn’t respond and continued to look past me with those quiet whimpers. This time I gave in and turned to see what he was looking at. Not too far back and away from us, on top of the cliff sat a lone coyote. The yote watched us with a look that burned down into my bones, the same look I had seen in my dream. A knowing look, a hateful look. Ice sliced up through my body as I stared back into oily black eyes. As long as I live, I will never forget those eyes.

“Boss!” It was Teo. I whipped my head back to see Scraps cradled in the arms of Teo and Quillo, stiff and gnarled like an old corpse. His eyes were rolled back, leaving only the whites visible, and he convulsed with a shaky, jerking motion like something was trying to break out of him. Vomit and foam sputtered out from his lips and specked his shirt followed by a throaty gargled groan.

“My god,” I jumped up and grabbed him by the ankles, “get him on his side!”

The convulsing stopped as we started rolling Scraps over and he started mumbling a bunch of gibberish. We got him on his side, and I hooked a finger into his mouth to make sure he wasn’t choking on anything he threw up. I glanced back in the direction I’d seen that damn coyote, hoping for a moment that he wouldn’t be there when I looked up—but there he was. He still sat in the same spot watching the scene below like he had orchestrated the whole thing himself.

I felt a presence again, quite like the one I had felt in Rocha Gorge, but this time it felt much different. Something evil lurked behind every outcrop, peering out at us with ill intent. Something sinister hid in the brushy hilltops, plotting and scheming. But what *was* it? Was it the spirit of Santiago wandering after us, seeking revenge? Or was it something else?

I looked at Teo whose eyes were also set on the Coyote. “What do you make of all this?” I asked.

“It’s the heat, boss,” Quillo interjected, “Scraps doesn’t drink much water and now all this heat cooked his brain. That’s all. We just need to—”

“I wasn’t asking you,” I snapped. “What do you make of all this, Teo?”

Teo looked at me and I was surprised to see no fear in his eyes; he almost seemed relaxed. Like he had resigned to a fate only he knew.

“I’m not sure,” he looked over at Quillo, “you got an egg and a bowl I can use?”

Quillo nodded his head and quickly got to his feet. Quillo got up and dusted off his pants and made quick work out of filling Teo’s request. He returned with a tin bowl and a large white egg. Teo nodded graciously and gently plucked the egg out of Quillo’s hand and motioned for him to set the bowl on the ground.

“Roll him on his back.” Teo asked. Quillo and I gently rolled Scraps back over onto his back. His shirt was dark with sweat stains and his face glistened in the sun. He was still muttering something I couldn’t understand, and his eyes were still glassy and wide.

Teo shot another glance in the direction of the coyote as he moved to position himself at Scraps’ side. He took the egg and cupped it in his hand and whispered what I suspected was a prayer before placing it gently on Scraps’ forehead.

He slowly slid the egg down Scraps’ forehead, down his chin and throat, continuing down until he reached the waist of his pants. He then continued down and back up his left leg then down and back up his right leg. Finally, he moved the egg back up Scraps’ torso down and back up one arm and down and back up the other. He performed the strange little ritual with the precision of someone who had done it hundreds of times. There was something wonderfully reverent about the whole process. It reminded me of a time when me and my mama still lived out east. I don’t remember a whole lot from those days, but I remember going to a catholic mass with her once. I remember watching the procession of priests and other clergy walking down the aisle to the altar, clothed in robes and colorful sashes, guided forward by a hymn sung by the congregation. There was something so beautiful and comforting about religion, and in that moment watching Teo’s egg ritual, I made a bargain with God that if he let me out of this, I’d make it a fixture of my life.

“Limpia con huevo.” Quillo whispered.

“What?” I whispered back.

Quillo nodded towards Teo. “Mexican folk magic. You use the egg to soak up the energy inside someone. Crack it in a bowl, and the shape the yoke takes tells you what you’re dealing with.”

I nodded. I picked a pebble up off the ground and started turning it over in my hands with quiet reflection.  “You think we made a mistake not burying that fella?”

Quillo pursed his lips. “I ain’t sure to be honest. We’ve left plenty of men out to rot. I dunno why this one would’ve been any different.”

“Did you feel anything in that gorge?” I waved my hand, searching for the words. “Like a presence or somethin’?”

Quillo thought for a moment and then shook his head. “Can’t say I did.”

“Alright.” Teo’s voice broke up our conversation. He sat up and moved back to his original spot where the tin bowl waited for him. He tapped the egg on the edge of the bowl and split it open with a loud crack. Before the eggs contents had time to settle in the bowl, Teo jumped to his feet.

“No, no, no, no.” He echoed. Teo’s eyes were saucers as he stared down into the bowl.

“What?” I barked, “What is it?”

Teo didn’t speak a word, he just motioned me over. I got up with a huff and walked around to where he stood. In the bowl sat the two eggshells, and a puddle of dark blood.

 

VI

 

“What does it mean?” I asked. Teo looked over at me, I’d never seen a man so horrified.

“It’s… It’s not good.”

“Okay,” I growled, “not good, how?”

Scraps suddenly let out guttural screech and his body stiffened and twisted like branches on a dying tree. Quillo went to Scraps’ horse and unhooked his waterskin from his saddlebag. With quick steps he came back over to where Scraps lied in a contorted pile and began attending to him.

“It’s Santiago, isn’t it?” I asked.

“I thought so at first,” Teo sighed, “but now I think we’re dealing with something *much* worse than a wandering spirit.” Teo knelt down, carved out a small hole in the earth and dumped the blood from the bowl into the hole. He carefully covered the hole and pated it solid before standing back upright. “People from my village talk about spirits that live in the wild places. These spirits are ancient, possibly older than the dirt we walk on. They live in the mountains, the rivers… Everywhere.” Teo glanced over where the Coyote still sat watching us. “Above all else, these spirits want these places where they live untouched by us. They don’t want us fishing in the rivers they swim in, they don’t want us taking wood from the forests they hide in.”

Teo gave me a stern look and continued. “Violating these wishes is a serious offense.”

“And I’m assuming leaving a soul to wander in one of these spirits homes would be—”

“The ultimate sign of disrespect.” Teo cut me off, and in the distance, I could hear the yote yip and howl like it was punctuating his words.

I swallowed. “Well, what if we turn back and bury Santiago?”

Teo shook his head. “It’s too late for that now.” He looked westward.

“So what?” I snapped. “We just wait around for this thing to pick us off one at a time?”

“I know of a bruja who lives in a village not too far west of here.” Teo mounted his horse. “She might be able to help us.”

Without another word I helped Quillo get Scraps into his saddle, and we tied him snug to his horse. Quillo volunteered to lead the horse so Teo could ride next to me and describe our new heading. We rode quickly into the setting sun, hope and dread filling us like oil and water. Every so often I would glance over my shoulder to check on Scraps, and with every glance I saw that damn coyote keeping pace behind us.",1,1769444427.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I saw a lot of advice saying to make sure to keep enough cash in reserve for all the stuff you need to buy right away after closing, so I thought it would be interesting to keep track of everything we paid for leading up to and following the purchase.

Overall, we spent pretty aggressively to get all the stuff we wanted to make the house feel ""done"" since we were fortunate enough to have the money to do so. As you can see from the breakdown, a lot of the things we bought could have been purchased later if we were more willing to let some rooms feel ""unfinished"".

Some context - we live in a midwestern suburb. We are in our early 30's, no kids yet, make about $125k combined, and have credit scores in the high 700's. The house is about 1700 sq ft with a finished basement - 3 beds, 4 bathrooms (two full, one 3/4, one half) and about 8k sq ft lot. We consider this our ""forever"" home and plan to raise up to two kids here.

Then I spent way too much time researching this (books, podcasts, psychology papers, even Reddit threads at 3am) and realized it's actually a skill anyone can learn.

The real issue isn't that you suck at conversations. It's that we're taught to view small talk as fake or pointless, we're constantly in our heads overthinking, and modern life has made us forget how to just...talk. But here's the thing, once you understand the psychology behind human connection and learn a few practical frameworks, starting conversations becomes almost automatic.

Here's what actually works:

1. Stop trying to be interesting, be interested instead

This completely changed how I approach conversations. Most people walk into social situations thinking ""what should I say to sound smart/funny/cool?"" which makes you nervous and performative. Instead, flip it. Your only job is to be genuinely curious about the other person.

[Dr. Charles Duhigg's Supercommunicators](https://charlesduhigg.com/) (Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, bestselling author of The Power of Habit). The book breaks down how exceptional communicators create connection, and the core principle is that great conversationalists ask deep questions and actually listen to answers. It's insanely good, like you'll finish it and realize you've been doing conversations on hard mode your entire life.

Ask questions that can't be answered with yes/no. Instead of ""did you have a good weekend?"" try ""what was the best part of your weekend?"" or ""what's been keeping you busy lately?"" Then actually pay attention to their answer and ask follow up questions. People will literally think you're the most charming person they've met because you gave them something rare, your full attention.

1. Use the ARE method to never run out of things to say

This framework is stupid simple but effective. ARE stands for Anchor, Reveal, Encourage.

Anchor means you comment on something in your shared environment. ""This coffee shop is packed today"" or ""That's an interesting book you're reading.""

Reveal means you share something about yourself related to the anchor. ""I've been trying to find a good spot to work remotely"" or ""I've been meaning to read more fiction but keep defaulting to productivity books.""

Encourage means you invite them to share. ""Do you come here often?"" or ""What made you pick that one?""

The beauty of this is you're not forcing anything. You're just creating an opening. If they're not interested in talking, they'll give you a short answer and you move on. No rejection, just information.

1. Embrace the awkward silence

Hot take but silence isn't the enemy. The anxiety about silence is. When there's a pause in conversation, most people panic and either say something stupid or bail entirely. Instead, just...pause. Take a breath. Look around. The other person will usually fill the silence, or you'll naturally think of something to say.

[Celeste Headlee's TED talk ""10 Ways to Have a Better Conversation""](https://www.celesteheadlee.com/) (watched by millions, she's a professional interviewer) emphasizes that good conversations have rhythm. They're not just constant verbal diarrhea. Pauses give both people time to think and process. They make conversations feel more natural and less like a job interview.

1. Stop waiting for the perfect moment to speak

Analysis paralysis is real. You see someone you want to talk to, you wait for the ""right moment,"" you rehearse what to say, and then either the moment passes or you psych yourself out. The fix is to give yourself a 3 second rule. When you decide you want to approach someone, you have 3 seconds to physically move toward them before your brain starts generating excuses.

Your opening line doesn't have to be clever or original. ""Hey, I'm \[name\]"" works. ""Mind if I join you?"" works. ""I couldn't help but notice \[observation\]"" works. The content matters way less than the fact that you initiated. Most people are secretly hoping someone else will break the ice.

1. Match their energy and communication style

This is straight from research on rapport building. People feel most comfortable with those who mirror their communication patterns. If someone speaks slowly and thoughtfully, don't rapid fire questions at them. If someone is high energy and animated, don't give them monotone one word responses.

Same with depth. Some people want to talk about philosophy and meaning, others want to keep it light and talk about their dog. Neither is better, just different. Pay attention to what they seem interested in discussing and meet them there.

1. Have a few go-to stories ready

This isn't about being fake, it's about being prepared. Think of 3-4 interesting or funny things that happened to you recently that you can share when relevant. They don't have to be epic tales, just little moments. Something weird your coworker said. A random interaction at the grocery store. A show you're watching.

Having these ready means you're not scrambling when someone asks ""what have you been up to?"" Plus, good stories invite good stories. When you share something specific and personal (not too personal, we're not trauma dumping), it gives the other person permission to do the same.

1. Exit gracefully

Knowing how to end a conversation is just as important as starting one. You don't have to talk until one of you dies. After 5-10 minutes, it's totally fine to say ""It was really nice talking to you, I'm gonna grab another drink/say hi to a friend/get back to my book, but enjoy the rest of your day."" Or exchange contact info if it went well. ""We should continue this conversation sometime, want to swap numbers?""

Don't ghost mid conversation or make up elaborate excuses. Just be honest and polite. People respect directness.

1. Practice in low stakes situations

The checkout person at the store. Your Uber driver. Someone waiting in line with you. These are perfect opportunities to practice because there's no pressure. Make a small observation, ask a simple question, smile. That's it. The more you do it, the more natural it becomes.

I started doing this and realized most people are actually pretty friendly when you give them an opening. It also desensitizes you to the fear of initiating.

[BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/) is an AI-powered personalized learning app that's been solid for building these conversation and social skills consistently. Built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it transforms content from books, research papers, and expert talks into custom podcasts tailored to your specific goals. Type in what you're working on, like mastering conversation techniques or overcoming social anxiety, and it pulls from vetted sources to create a learning plan just for you. You control the depth, from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context. The voice options are genuinely addictive too, everything from calm and educational to sarcastic depending on your mood. Makes it easy to fit real growth into commute time or gym sessions without feeling like work.

Look, you're not gonna become a social butterfly overnight. Some conversations will still be awkward. Some people won't want to talk. That's fine. The goal isn't perfection, it's getting more comfortable with the process. Every conversation is practice for the next one.

The psychology behind all of this is pretty straightforward. Humans are social creatures who crave connection but are also scared of rejection. When you make it easy for someone to connect with you by being warm, curious, and authentic, most people will respond positively. And the ones who don't? That's data, not rejection.",1,1769444372.0,GroundedMentality,0,1.0,False
1qnkja6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1qnkja6/shame_spiral/,Shame spiral,"Hi everyone. I have struggled with substance abuse for a long time. I have also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and have been in a bit of a hypomanic state (i didn’t realize this on my own but several friends confronted me \[kindly\] about it over the last few days and allowed me to see it). This is relevant because just over a week ago i began sleeping with a man i don’t really know. 

I initiated it but he was verrry keen and we have spent four of the last seven nights together. I imagined it would be a one night stand honestly but then he was just so sweet to me, so gentle and affectionate, that i developed a massive crush. Frankly disproportionate to the actual level of intimacy /reality of the “relationship” (which is what is making me think it’s tied in to the hypomania). 

I also am totally sex positive and don’t think we need to overly pathologize it, but hyper sexuality and impulsivity around sex \*are\* things i always struggle with when i am in this state, and the fact that i met him essentially only once (he’s actually like the mechanic/handyman etc for my apartment complex and he came to fix my cabinets and that’s when i asked for his number & started sexting with him just a few hours later, and slept with him the very next day, seems a little impulsive, even for me.) That said, I have zero regrets about it (the sex is AMAZING) but i want to give the full picture of my sort of… “over investment” or fixation or whatever it is.

Two nights ago he was supposed to come over and we were going out for a pizza (his idea). He initially said he would pick me up around 7:30, but he works as a mechanic and does carpentry – – he is working to send money back to his family in Brazil, and he’s financially struggling, so I know he has to work quite a lot. However, he continued, pushing back the time and eventually it was midnight, and I still had not seen him. I did the wrong thing, and took 4 mg of Xanax and had several vodka drinks. I have been struggling very hard to stay sober, but I’ve not been succeeding very well, and this feeling of disappointment and letdown gave me the excuse I was looking for to use. I figured I would just fall asleep. But then, around two in the morning, he actually did show up. The problem? I have no memory of this. Like. ZERO. Full blackout. 

I literally woke up the morning after, alone, and did not remember that he had come over until I came upstairs and saw that there was a pair of his clothes left, folded on the coffee table beside my front door, and that there were several pizza boxes out. Then some of the night started coming back to me, and I remembered us ordering pizza and laughing about something, but I do not remember anything else. I am terrified that I said, or did something awful or embarrassing because I have not heard from him since then. I am confused why he left a pair of clothes here, as again, these were not forgotten under the bed or anything, they are like… Ironed and folded and set on my coffee table, as if he was planning to come back another night and left an outfit here so he could go straight from here to work or something (which is something he has talked about doing before). Seeing the clothes made me think that maybe I did not do anything too embarrassing, because it seems to indicate to me that he is planning on coming back over. 

However. 

I texted him right away and said how bad I felt about having drunk too much and mixed it with Xanax and that the truth is, I don’t have a lot of recollections of what happened and that I feel embarrassed about this. I was hoping he would respond and we could laugh it off, but he didn’t. It has now been almost 2 days since that incident. I have sent him a few messages (trying not to overload it but also can’t stand this feeling) saying the honest truth, which is“I feel embarrassed about the other night, I’m afraid I may be did something wrong, if so, I would like to discuss it, apologize and make it up to you, though I understand if you don’t want to hang out anymore, I would just like the chance to talk about what happened.“ 

He has read all of these messages, I can see the read receipts, but he has not responded to a single one. I am devastated and ashamed, and so disappointed in myself. I am mortified, and I cannot believe that I seem to have messed up a really good and fun thing because of that one night relapse. And I truly have no idea what I could have said or done. But I don’t think it bodes well that he isn’t returning any of my messages. So I’m not sure exactly what I’m looking for, other than… I’m too ashamed to tell anyone else in my life because I don’t want them to know that I relapsed. But I don’t know how else to explain the sudden disappearance of this person. so I am disappointed and confused and feel disoriented because I have literally no memory of that night whatsoever. It is frankly making me want to drink and use more just to stop feeling this acute shame even though intellectually i KNOW that would be worst possible way to cope with this. 

Sorry if this is a bit too long.  Any thoughts, advice, anything, is appreciated. I just had to get this out somewhere, somehow, instead of keeping it inside",1,1769444348.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

I got up and checked the locks for the tenth time. Front door: deadbolt engaged. Back door: braced with a heavy oak beam. Windows: latched and shuttered. My breathing was shallow, a sharp contrast to the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the hallway. I felt like a rabbit in a hole, listening for the shadow of the hawk.

It was 11:42 PM when the first anomaly happened.

I was in the living room, trying to read a book to distract myself, when my phone vibrated on the coffee table. A notification from an anonymous messaging app I hadn’t used in years.

satans\\\_child\\\_666: The soil is thirsty, Elias.

I dropped the phone. The screen cracked, a spiderweb of glass obscuring the text. My name. He knew my name. I hadn't told anyone my name since I moved out here to escape the city. I stared at the device as if it were a venomous snake.

Ping.

satans\\\_child\\\_666: Do you hear the crickets, Elias? Notice how they’ve stopped singing?

I froze. My ears strained against the silence. He was right. The usual nighttime chorus of the Smokies had vanished. The woods were dead quiet. No wind, no insects, just the thud-thud-thud of my own heart against my ribs.

I stood up, my legs feeling like lead. I grabbed the shotgun from the mantle—a Remington 870. The weight of the steel was the only thing keeping me from collapsing. I walked to the kitchen window and peeled back the corner of the heavy curtain.

At first, there was nothing but the black silhouette of the pines against a moonless sky. Then, I saw it. A flickering orange glow. Far down the driveway, near the edge of my property. Then another. And another.

Torches.

They weren't moving fast. They were drifting toward the house with a terrifying, synchronized patience. There must have been twelve of them. They wore heavy, floor-length robes of a red so dark it looked like dried blood in the torchlight. Their faces were hidden behind bone masks—bleached deer skulls with the antlers still attached.

""Oh god,"" I whispered, my voice breaking. ""Oh god, no.""

I backed away from the window, my mind racing. I needed to call the police, but the landline was dead. I checked my cell—No Service. The ""Night Walkers"" from the news weren't a rumor. They were on my lawn.

Suddenly, a heavy thump echoed from the porch. Then a rhythmic, wet scratching sound, like a knife being dragged through raw meat.

Scrape. Scrape. Scrape.

They were marking the door.

""Get away from here!"" I screamed, aiming the shotgun at the heavy oak wood of the front door. ""I have a gun! I'll kill you!""

A laugh came from the other side. It wasn't a human laugh. It was a high-pitched, warbling sound that vibrated in my teeth.

""The vessel is loud tonight,"" a voice said. It was cold, devoid of any empathy. ""The Prince likes them loud. It makes the soul easier to extract.""

The smell started then. A cloying, metallic scent of copper and rotted lilies. It seeped through the cracks in the doorframe. I felt bile rise in my throat. I backed into the hallway, toward the basement door. It was the only room with no windows, the only place to hide.

CRACK.

The sound of a window shattering upstairs. They hadn't tried the front door. They were coming through the second floor. I heard the heavy, deliberate footsteps of boots on hardwood directly above my head.

""Elias..."" the voice whispered from the ceiling. ""Why run? The circle is already drawn. The mountain has already claimed you.""

I bolted for the basement, throwing myself down the wooden stairs and slamming the door shut, sliding the bolt. I huddled in the corner behind my old boiler, the shotgun clutched to my chest. I was sobbing now, great, racking gasps of air that tasted like dust.

""Please,"" I whimpered to the dark. ""Please, I haven't done anything.""

My phone screen lit up one last time in my pocket.

satans\\\_child\\\_666: Look up.

I didn't want to. Every instinct in my body told me to keep my eyes closed. But I looked.

There, in the floorboards of the kitchen directly above me, a hole had been quietly cut. A single, unblinking eye looked down through the gap. The eye was surrounded by the jagged bone of a deer skull.

""Found you,"" the voice whispered.

The basement door didn't creak. It exploded inward.

Four of them were there. They didn't rush. They moved with a horrific, liturgical grace. The one in the center carried a curved blade, the edge shimmering with a strange, oily light. He held a small tablet in his other hand—the screen showed a chat interface.

He was satans\\\_child\\\_666.

""The harvest is ready,"" the leader said, his voice echoing in the small concrete room.

I tried to raise the shotgun, but my arms felt like they were made of water. One of the cultists stepped forward and simply took the weapon from my hands. I was too terrified to even scream anymore. My brain had shut down, retreating into a numb, icy void.

They grabbed my arms. Their grip was like iron. They dragged me toward the center of the basement, where they had already laid out a tarp and a series of silver bowls.

""Wait, wait, please!"" I finally found my voice as they forced me onto my knees. ""Take my money! Take the house! Just let me go!""

The leader knelt in front of me. He reached out and traced the line of my jaw with the cold, sharp tip of the blade. The deer skull mask loomed inches from my face, the empty eye sockets filled with a darkness that seemed deeper than the room itself.

""Money is for the living, Elias,"" he said softly. ""We are here to give you something much more permanent.""

He turned to the others and raised the knife toward the ceiling.

""By the blood of the earth and the fire of the pit,"" he chanted, the others joining in a low, guttural drone. ""We offer this vessel. Let the smoke rise. Let the Prince drink.""

The last thing I saw before the blade descended was the leader’s thumb tapping the screen of his tablet, sending one final message to a forum I would never see again.

satans\\\_child\\\_666: The stream is live. Witness the transition.

Then, there was only the cold bite of the steel and the smell of lilies.

That was a long one—I hope it captured the dread you were looking for. Would you like me to write a follow-up from the perspective of the police officer who finds the ""unseen"" footage later?",1,1769444221.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

1qnkgyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1qnkgyg/did_anyone_think_they_had_an_eating_disorder/,Did anyone think they had an eating disorder before realizing it was histamine intolerance / hormones?,"I’ve been dealing with histamine-intolerance-like symptoms for about three years now.

For a long time, I genuinely thought something was wrong with me. Last November, I finally started noticing a pattern: around ovulation I would feel absolutely terrible—anxiety, panic, feeling “off,” food reactions—and then after ovulation I’d slowly feel normal again.

Food became a huge source of stress. I thought I had an eating disorder because I was constantly anxious around eating and developed some really unhealthy behaviors around food (and I mean bad ones). Looking back, the common denominator was always food + stress, and food itself created stress because I never knew how I’d feel afterward.

I even had to give up coffee, which helped my anxiety a lot. I’ve never really been into wine, beer, cheese, or obvious high-histamine foods, which made me feel like ‘the weird one’ in the friend group because I would never consume those and always reject it. 

Now I’m starting to wonder if it was never “me” or an eating disorder at all—but estrogen, histamine, and whatever cascade happens around ovulation that was triggering anxiety and panic attacks.

So I’m curious:

Did anyone here feel like they had an eating disorder before discovering histamine intolerance or hormone-related histamine issues?

What tests (if any) helped you get diagnosed or at least pointed you in the right direction?

What would you recommend for someone who is just starting to connect these dots?

Honestly, I’m still processing a lot of grief and relief at the same time. Would really appreciate hearing others’ experiences.

1qnkgb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1qnkgb9/what_no_squirrels/,What no Squirrel’s,"A Day Off: Sisters on the Ridge

Elizabeth woke with the soft chime of her datapad pulling her from sleep. A message from Rachel glowed on the screen, sent late last night:

Liz – tomorrow’s our day off. How about we hike up above the quarry? We can look out over the beach, just us and the view. Bring the good coffee?

A warm smile spread across her face. Only Rachel called her Liz, and it felt like being claimed as family—big-sister claimed. Elizabeth typed back quickly: I’ll fill the thermos. See you at 0900? She added a little flower emoji, knowing it would make Rachel grin.

At 0900 sharp, Elizabeth stepped out into the bright morning light of New Town, thermos slung over her shoulder. Rachel’s hab sat just a short walk from the beach path. She found Rachel already on the wooden bench outside, legs crossed, one mug of coffee in hand and another steaming on the small side table. Anna’s flowers bloomed vibrantly around them—purple starblooms nodding gently, yellow sun trumpets catching the sun, white moonlilies still half-open from dawn.

“Rach,” Elizabeth greeted, settling beside her.

Rachel looked up, eyes crinkling. “Liz. Right on time. Anna’s outdone herself again—Clara was spot-on steering her into florist work. Once visitors start arriving, we’ll train one of the new bookkeepers with her too.”

She handed over the spare mug. “Coffee’s hot. Let’s go before it cools.”

They set off together, sipping as they walked the coastal path. The ocean glittered to their left in shades of turquoise and silver; gentle waves rolled in, seabirds wheeled overhead calling to each other. The air carried salt, distant pine resin, and the faint metallic hum of quarry machinery far below.

A small Ykanti utility truck rolled up, its front roller brush spinning lazily as it swept dust from the road. The driver honked twice and waved with a grin.

Elizabeth laughed. “That’s the street sweeper Aino was talking about at Checkers the other night.”

Rachel nodded. “Marcus’s parts list—I ordered them while on the Nori Navio. Took a few shipments to get the brush motor right.”

“Oh, Rach,” Elizabeth said, glancing sideways with a teasing smile, “the day Wyatt brought Marcus to your office on the Nori Navio… did you show him the video of Wyatt taking the Gallant Venture? And if you did, how did he react?”

Rachel laughed softly, the memory clear. “Yes—that was exactly when I ordered the datapads for everyone. Wyatt left Marcus with me to go see Clara. I figured the big guy could use some context on who he was really working for.”

She paused, eyes sparkling with amusement. “I pulled up the footage. Marcus is massive compared to Wyatt—built like a cargo hauler. But watching Wyatt board under fire, take command, turn the whole mess around… Marcus’s face went from calm confidence to pure terror. Eyes wide, jaw slack. When Wyatt came back, Marcus was… how shall I put it? A lot less ‘I’m a big guy who can handle anything’ and a lot more ‘respectful silence.’ He barely spoke the rest of the meeting.”

Elizabeth burst out laughing, nearly spilling her coffee. “I can picture it! The great Marcus, humbled by a video.”

“Exactly,” Rachel said, grinning. “Wyatt has that effect. Quiet command. Makes even the toughest rethink their size.”

They continued, the road giving way to gravel that curved upward around a rocky corner. An auxiliary security post appeared ahead: two young privates in light armor beside a folding table and comms array.

“Morning, Miss Elizabeth, Miss Rachel,” the male private said with a nod. “Heading up to the overlook?”

“Just a hike,” Elizabeth replied. “Enjoying the view from the top.”

The female private smiled. “Path’s secure to the old Baron’s gardens. Sensor towers going in at key spots—precaution after recent sightings. Sergeant Major briefed the council.”

Rachel nodded. “He mentioned it last meeting. Appreciate it.”

“Here,” the woman said, handing over two compact radios. “Clip them on. We’ll monitor.”

“Thanks,” Rachel said, fastening hers.

The male private perked up. “Pizza delivery at 1300 from Ykanti’s Italian. Want to add an order?”

Elizabeth glanced at Rachel. “Medium?”

They spoke together: “Cheese with extra mushrooms and cheese, please.”

The woman jotted it down. “Got it. We’ll bring it up. Enjoy.”

The path steepened, the view opening wider with every step: quarry steps below, beach stretching pale and endless, waves like slow breaths. Halfway up, they paused to breathe.

“This is perfect,” Elizabeth said, wind tugging her hair. “No ledgers, no repairs—just us.”

Rachel looked out over the water. “Days like this make the rest worth it. Building something real.”

At the ridge top—a flat rock overlooking the coastline—they sat, poured the last coffee, and let the quiet settle.

Elizabeth leaned against Rachel’s shoulder. “Best big-sister hike yet.”

Rachel rested her head against Elizabeth’s. “Agreed, sis. Here’s to more.”

They sat in comfortable silence, wind carrying distant waves and resin scent from the trees below.

Rachel tilted her head. “Have you ever been up here before? On foot, I mean.”

Elizabeth shook her head. “No. Never hiked it. But remember when Leo took us up in the shuttle right before the Nori Navio left? We flew over this ridge, and I kept thinking… I want to explore that on the ground someday. See it close up.”

Rachel smiled. “Same. I stared out the window the whole flight, wishing we could land and walk it. The aerial view was stunning, but this—feeling the ground under us—is better.”

Elizabeth’s gaze drifted downward to a sheltered grove tucked against the hillside. Her eyes widened. “I’ve never seen trees like that here on Haego.”

She said it almost to herself. Elizabeth—self-taught botanical expert, nearly 20 now—had spent her life studying every native plant on this world. She’d been just 19 when she first met Wyatt, sent by her father Tornel (the planet’s leader) because Wyatt desperately needed someone with deep knowledge of Haego’s flora for the barony’s gardens, agriculture, and survival. Tornel had his own quiet reasons,  hoping his daughter could keep an eye on things, act as an informal liaison. Wyatt had figured it out almost immediately, but he welcomed it. He liked that Elizabeth could speak openly with her father; it built trust across the fragile alliances holding the colony together. The awkward first meeting—her blurting out that ridiculous rumor-question about nobles “taking a woman to sleep with” still made her cringe, but Wyatt angrily said no , and it hadn’t stopped her from thriving here.

Rachel followed her gaze. “Those look like old Earth English Walnut Trees.”

Elizabeth blinked. “Walnut? Like Juglans regia? The ones with green husks and nuts that stain your fingers?”

Rachel nodded, leaning forward. “Exactly. See the compound leaves? The spreading branches? Not native at all. Someone planted them—early colonists, maybe a seed bank that took. They’re thriving here, sheltered from the winds.”

Elizabeth was already standing, excitement lighting her face. “Let’s go look. Closer. I need to see if they’re fruiting.”

Rachel laughed and rose too. “Lead the way, botanist. If we find walnuts, we’re bringing some back—for Anna’s pots or next pizza topping.”

They picked down a faint side trail, radios clipped, voices low with wonder. The grove drew them in—tall, broad-canopied trees with rough bark and dangling green husks like promises. Elizabeth reached up, brushing a leaf gently, inhaling the sharp, earthy scent.

“Real walnuts on Haego,” she murmured. “Wyatt’s going to want to know. Maybe we can graft some, spread them around New Town.”

Rachel watched her, smiling softly. “You light up when you find something new.”

Elizabeth turned, a playful glint in her eye. “And you get a sparkle in your eyes and that little smile whenever someone even mentions Wyatt’s name—especially when he was younger. Like right now.”

Rachel’s cheeks flushed pink almost instantly. She looked away toward the ocean, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear.

Elizabeth softened her tone, stepping closer. “Sis… is there anything you’d like to talk about?”

Rachel met her gaze for a second, then shook her head gently, blush deepening. “Not now, please.”

Elizabeth nodded, no pressure, just understanding. “Okay. Whenever you’re ready. I’m here.”

Rachel gave a small, grateful smile. “Thanks, Liz.”

They lingered among the trees, ocean view peeking through branches, two young women on a day off that had become a small, unexpected discovery—and perhaps the start of a deeper conversation waiting for the right moment.

Elizabeth’s radio crackled softly.

“Miss Elizabeth, Miss Rachel—this is Private Torres at the post. Pizza’s here. I’ll bring up a couple bottles of water too. Heading your way now.”

Elizabeth grinned, pressing the talk button. “Thanks, Torres! We’ll meet you at the top of the path in about five minutes.”

Rachel added, “Appreciate it—see you soon.”

The radio clicked off.

Elizabeth glanced at Rachel. “Perfect timing. I’m starving.”

They retraced their steps up the faint trail, emerging back onto the main ridge path just as Private Torres crested the last switchback. She moved briskly—no huffing, no pauses—Sergeant Bauer’s relentless PT drills clearly paying off. In her arms: an insulated delivery bag with the Ykanti Italian logo, two chilled water bottles tucked under one elbow.

Torres smiled as she reached them. “One medium cheese with extra mushrooms and cheese. And water—figured you’d want it after the climb.”

Rachel took the bag with a grateful nod. “You’re a lifesaver. Thank you for hauling this up.”

Elizabeth accepted the waters. “Seriously—thank you. Tell the others we owe them one.”

Torres gave a quick salute-like wave. “Enjoy, ladies. Radio’s still on if you need anything.” She turned and headed back down at an easy jog, disappearing around the bend.

Rachel and Elizabeth carried their prize back to the flat rock overlook. They spread the pizza box between them, popped the water bottles, and dug in. The cheese stretched in long, gooey strings; mushrooms earthy and perfect against the salty crust. The ocean breeze carried away the heat of the day, mixing with the scent of tomato sauce and warm dough.

They ate slowly, trading bites and quiet laughs, watching the waves far below roll in endless silver lines. Hours slipped by unnoticed—talking about Anna’s next flower beds, speculating on what grafts they could try with the walnut trees, sharing small stories from childhood on Haego. No rush. No ledger. Just the two of them, pizza cooling in the box, water bottles emptying, and the vast blue horizon.

Eventually, the sun dipped lower, painting the water gold. Elizabeth stretched. “We should head back before it gets dark.”

Rachel nodded, gathering the empty box, napkins, and bottles into the bag the pizza had come with. “No trace left behind. Good habit.”

They hiked down the path at a leisurely pace, radios clipped to their belts, the grove’s walnut scent still clinging faintly to their clothes. At the auxiliary post, the two privates were still on duty.

Elizabeth unclipped her radio first. “Here you go, thanks again for the pizza delivery. That was above and beyond.”

Rachel handed hers over too. “Really appreciate you bringing it up. Made the day even better.”

The male private grinned. “No problem. Sergeant Bauer says we train for everything—including pizza runs.”

The female private laughed. “Have a good rest of your day, ladies.”

They waved goodbye and continued down toward New Town, the coastal path now bathed in late-afternoon light. The quarry machinery hummed distantly, seabirds called, and the ocean glittered like it was winking at them.

Elizabeth bumped Rachel’s shoulder lightly. “Best day off in forever, sis.”

Rachel smiled, bumping back. “Agreed. Let’s make it a regular thing.”

As the building’s of New Town came into view below, the two women walked side by side—full of pizza, full of quiet discoveries, and full of the kind of easy friendship that made even ordinary days feel like something special",1,1769444174.0,OpenHFY,0,1.0,False

1qnkbsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1qnkbsu/cr_the_first_night_shift/,[CR] The First Night Shift,"Officer Daniel Mercer still checked his badge every time he walked into the station.

It wasn’t vanity. It was disbelief.

At thirty-two, he was older than most rookies—former EMT, career change, too many “are you sure about this?” conversations with people who meant well. The badge was proof that he had chosen something difficult on purpose.

The precinct smelled like burnt coffee and old paper. Phones rang, keyboards clicked, and somewhere down the hall, someone laughed too loudly. Daniel adjusted his vest as Sergeant Alvarez approached.

“You ready for your first night shift?” she asked.

Daniel nodded. “As ready as I can be.”

She handed him the keys. “You’re riding with Officer Collins. Don’t try to be a hero.”

Collins was already waiting by the patrol car, leaning against the hood like he’d been born there. Early forties. Calm eyes. The kind of cop who didn’t rush because he didn’t need to.

They drove in silence for a while, city lights blurring past the windshield.

“You’ll hear a lot tonight,” Collins finally said. “Most of it won’t make sense.”

Daniel smiled nervously. “That’s comforting.”

The first call was minor. Noise complaint. Drunk couple arguing about something neither of them remembered starting. Daniel stood awkwardly to the side while Collins handled it with a patience that felt rehearsed but genuine.

“You learn quick,” Collins said back in the car, “that most people don’t want solutions. They want to feel seen.”

The second call came twenty minutes later.

Possible burglary. Silent alarm. Small electronics store on the edge of downtown.

Daniel felt his pulse spike as they parked. Training kicked in—hands steady, eyes scanning, breath controlled. Inside, the store was dark, the silence thick.

They moved carefully.

In the back room, they found him. A teenager, maybe seventeen. Backpack half-filled with cables and chargers. Frozen, eyes wide, hands shaking.

“I didn’t take anything yet,” the kid said. “I swear.”

Daniel looked at Collins. Collins looked at the kid.

“Sit down,” Collins said calmly. “Hands where I can see them.”

While Collins ran the ID, Daniel stood there, watching the kid breathe too fast, watching fear pool in his eyes. It reminded Daniel of patients he’d seen in ambulances—people on the edge of something they didn’t understand.

No priors. No weapon.

“Policy says we bring him in,” Collins said quietly, after a pause.

Daniel nodded. That’s what the book said.

But as they escorted the kid outside, he whispered, “My mom’s sick. I just needed money.”

Daniel didn’t answer. He didn’t know how.

Back in the car, the silence returned, heavier this time.

“You okay?” Collins asked.

Daniel stared out the window. “I don’t know. I thought doing the right thing would feel clearer.”

Collins chuckled softly. “It rarely does.”

The night wore on.

Domestic dispute. Hit-and-run report with no witnesses. A call about a man sleeping on a bus bench who turned out to be just… tired.

Around 3 a.m., they stopped for coffee. Daniel’s hands finally stopped shaking.

Then the call came.

Shots fired. Alleyway. No further details.

They arrived fast. Too fast. Red and blue lights painted the walls in violent colors. A man lay on the ground, clutching his side. Blood soaked into the concrete.

Daniel dropped beside him instantly, EMT instincts taking over.

“I’m here,” Daniel said. “Stay with me.”

The man’s eyes flickered. “I didn’t see his face,” he murmured. “Just… footsteps.”

Sirens approached. Backup. An ambulance.

They saved him. Barely.

As the scene cleared, Collins leaned against the car, exhausted.

“Good work,” he said. “You didn’t freeze.”

Daniel swallowed. “I almost did.”

“Almost doesn’t count.”

Back at the station, Daniel filled out reports, fingers aching, mind replaying faces from the night—the kid, the wounded man, the drunk couple.

Before leaving, he checked his badge one more time.

It felt heavier now.

As he stepped outside into the early morning light, his phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number.

You were the one who helped him. Thank you.

No name. No context.

Daniel stared at the screen, unsure whether to feel relieved… or worried.

He clipped his badge back onto his belt and walked to his car, knowing one thing for certain:

1qnkaq3,https://i.redd.it/t7to4doywpfg1.png,"From $0 → $2,444 MRR as a solo founder (what actually moved the needle)","Just crossed **$2,444 MRR** this week.

For context: I’m building [this saas](https://blogseo.io/?atp=DFBMN6)[ ](https://blogseo.io/?atp=DFBMN6)(automated SEO & content for SaaS founders).

No funding.  
No co-founder.  
No big launch.

Just me, a lot of coffee, and slow compounding.

When I started, I thought growth would come from shipping faster or adding more features. That wasn’t it.

The real shift happened when I stopped treating growth like a one-time event and started treating it like a system.

I’m a technical founder, so instead of doing things manually, I automated as much as possible, especially content. I published consistently, even when traffic was basically zero. Month one felt pointless. Month two was slightly less pointless. Then suddenly organic signups started showing up every day.

One article ended up driving a huge chunk of traffic completely by accident. It wasn’t a keyword I would’ve picked manually. That was the moment it clicked for me: SEO rewards consistency way more than “perfect ideas”.

Another thing that helped a lot was staying close to early users. I answered every message, fixed bugs fast, and asked why people signed up (and why they didn’t). A few of those early users ended up becoming my best promoters.

I’m still very early. This isn’t life-changing money yet. But it’s real, growing, and predictable, which honestly feels better than a one-day spike ever could.

Next goal is $3k MRR.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

So many of us are silently overwhelmed, saying yes to things, habits, and people that suck the life out of us. This post isn’t some woo-woo “manifest peace” guide. It’s based on the most credible books, psychology research, podcasts, and expert insights.

Too much advice flying around social media right now (especially on TikTok) is all about morning routines, productivity hacks, and “just grind harder” platitudes. But real change starts with subtraction. Peace and focus aren’t about adding more, they’re about cutting what doesn’t fit. And the good news is, these are all skills you can build.

Here are 11 things you should start saying NO to, and the evidence-backed reasons why.

No to reactive mornings

Why it matters: Starting your day checking emails, scrolling TikTok, or replying to group chats puts your brain right into reaction mode. You lose your agency before you even finish your coffee.

Cal Newport (""Deep Work"") warns that constant task-switching early in the day destroys focus and builds addictive loops of shallow thinking.

Try this instead: Spend the first 30 minutes tech-free. Even just journaling or reading primes your brain for intentional work.

No to chronic people-pleasing

According to Dr. Nicole LePera (“How to Do the Work”), people-pleasing is often a trauma response. You feel guilt for having boundaries.

Saying yes to others often means saying no to yourself. And that’s how burnout creeps in.

Practice micro “no’s” like delaying responses or saying “Let me think about it.” Confidence builds slowly here.

No to digital clutter

Your phone isn’t just a tool. It’s an attention trap. A study from the University of Texas found that just having your phone in the room reduces your cognitive capacity, even when it’s off.

Remove unnecessary apps. Turn off non-human notifications. Build distance between you and dopamine slots.

No to zero-boundary relationships

Not everyone deserves access to your time or emotional energy.

Psychiatrist Dr. Henry Cloud (author of “Boundaries”) says unclear or non-existent boundaries are the 1 cause of emotional chaos.

If someone leaves you feeling drained every time, that’s a signal, not a coincidence.

No to performing for social media

Living for others’ validation rewires your brain’s reward system. You begin to crave likes more than meaning.

Pew Research found that over 59% of adults feel pressure to look successful on social platforms. It’s not harmless scrolling. It’s shaping your self-concept.

Post less. Lurk less. Live more.

No to advice from influencers who haven’t done the work

The rise of “motivational content” has created a sea of confident but unqualified influencers giving mental health and life advice.

Dr. Julie Smith (clinical psychologist and author of “Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?”) warns about this trend: “Be careful who you give authority over your mind.”

Vet your sources. Look for credentials, not just aesthetics.

No to commitments that don’t align with your long-term values

James Clear (“Atomic Habits”) says most people don’t need more motivation, they need more clarity.

Every yes is a commitment of time, energy, and attention. If it’s not a “hell yes,” it’s a no.

No to numbing with endless entertainment

Shows, games, and memes aren’t bad. But compulsively escaping into them is often a symptom of unmet needs.

Johann Hari (“Stolen Focus”) explains that attention isn’t just stolen, it’s given away when we don’t face boredom or emotional discomfort.

Add intentionality: schedule your leisure, don’t slide into it.

No to procrastination disguised as research

Spending hours preparing, planning, and watching “how-to” videos can feel productive, but it’s often just fear in disguise.

Oliver Burkeman (""Four Thousand Weeks"") says, “You’ll never get everything under control. Accept that and act anyway.”

Action > Perfection.

No to saying yes to every opportunity

The paradox of choice is real. More possibilities don’t always equal more progress.

A Harvard Business Review study found that high performers often struggle with opportunity overload, leading to lower impact and higher stress.

You don’t need to do everything to be successful. You need to do the right few things deeply.

No to harsh self-talk

You can’t shame yourself into growth. Self-judgment activates the same brain networks as physical pain (University of Michigan neuroscience lab).

Try self-compassion instead. Dr. Kristin Neff’s research shows it leads to better motivation and more consistent behavior change than self-criticism.

Watch your inner voice. Would you speak to a friend like that?

The most powerful life shift isn’t adding more stuff to do. It’s cutting the noise. Saying no isn’t negativity, it’s clarity. These aren’t moral failures or flaws. They’re patterns you can learn to recognize and slowly undo. Peace is built in the spaces you protect.",1,1769443714.0,Buildingmyfutureself,0,1.0,False

It’s basically cute, cozy illustrations of a comfy girl doing tiny, low-stress jobs—like working in a café, arranging plants, baking bread, running a little shop, journaling, or making coffee while it rains outside. No hustle culture. No “girlboss.” Just ✨vibes✨.

I started it because I was burned out and wanted something that felt:

soft

slow

aesthetic

low pressure

And somehow coloring a girl quietly making coffee or organizing jars feels more healing than therapy (don’t quote me).

The art style is warm, cozy, slightly cartoonish, and gives Studio Ghibli meets cottagecore meets lo-fi background girl. Perfect for adults, teens, or anyone who wants to escape loud life for 20 minutes.

* Link Mode: Journiv will store references to Immich assets and also add them in an album called Journiv in you immich profile so you can easily see all the assets used in your journal.
* Copy Mode: Journiv copies the original assets in it's media storage so you always have them in Journiv as a copy.
* Linkbacks: If an assets in your journal entry came from Journiv then Journiv shows you an option to jump back to that asset in Immich with a single click (well if we are counting it is two clicks :))
* Immich Picker: Journiv has a integrated immich picker which allow you to browse all your immich assets within Journiv.
* Principle of least privilege: Journiv Immich integration has been designed with principle of least privilege and require a [minimal set of permission](https://www.journiv.com/docs/guides/immich-integration#permissions-reference) on the API key to function.
* Many more features, bug fixes, enhancements.
* I also wrote a [blogpost](https://www.journiv.com/blog/engineering-journiv-scaling-media) about this development.
* Yesterday was a [big day for Journiv and me](https://www.reddit.com/r/Journiv/comments/1qledoc/special_day_for_journiv/): Alex Tran [u/altran1502](https://www.reddit.com/user/altran1502/), the founder of [Immich](https://immich.app/) became a Github sponsor of Journiv.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

◈◈◈

The underground safe house smelled like roasted garlic and something herbal Jin couldn't quite place.

  
*« Rosemary…»*

  
“Also coffee, old stone, and that faint metallic tang of blood,” Jin said. “You know the one that had soaked into fabric and wouldn't quite wash out, no matter how many times you scrubbed.”

He inhaled once more, slower this time.

Home. Or close enough.

Twenty-three hours had passed since the battle with Nourma. Jin had checked his watch maybe forty times in the first six hours, then stopped because obsessively tracking minutes wouldn't make his body recover faster. The others had spent most of that time in meditation, cycling essence, and forcing their bodies to accept the advances they'd clawed out of fighting an ORDER IV ranker.

You didn't get stronger through gentle cultivation sessions and peaceful reflection. You got stronger by refusing to die when every rational calculation said you should, then spending the aftermath forcing your mind and body to remember what that felt like.

Rudy had broken through something fundamental in his cultivation path. Jin had watched it happen a couple of hours back.

Rudy had been sitting cross-legged on the floor when his aura just suddenly went wham and boom, surging in power. The Heart That Refuses Ruin, that’s what Rudy called it. The first step of the first stage.

Jin felt it suited Rudy perfectly. The technique allowed him to decide that falling down wasn't an option, making his body believe it. Simple in theory. Horrifically difficult in practice.

On the other hand, Reyana's connection to her Mantle had deepened significantly. Jin had to spend hours just to extract and purge it all out of her system.

Death essence was the nastiest essence Jin had ever come in contact with. It demanded one thing from its wielders: death, yours or your enemies.

Jin's own gains were harder to quantify but no less real. He now had a realization and an idea of where he wanted to go. There were still many problems with that, and he had to prepare if he wanted to become worthy of standing next to his team. He still had the remains of Nourma to harvest, and if it was left to him, he would have jumped the gun and harvested the ORDER IV.

« How many times do I have to tell you… Extracting that much death… pure death out of Reyana had strained your channels and internal pathways to their limits. »

“Yeah, yeah.” Jin scoffed. “I know, still I can’t just be sitting idly when I have a piece of power ready to harvest!”

« You know what… Go on, try harvesting. I’d love to see you burst apart! »

“Well, seeing you’re so sincere in your warnings… I will be foolish not to heed your word, bro!” Jin said.

« … Coward. »

◈◈◈

  
Right now, Reyana was trying very hard not to laugh at Rudy's expense.

""I'm just saying,"" Rudy insisted, sprawled across one of the safe house's battered chairs like a cat claiming territory, ""the fact that my arms didn't break the second time I grabbed that sledgehammer is objective proof of improvement.""

""That's not how improvement works,"" Reyana said with amusement. ""Well, now that I think about it… You are indeed right.""

“See!” Rudy exclaimed. “I knew you would understand—”

“Improvement in being even more stupid!” Reyana interjected with a chuckle.

""yeah…” Rudy frowned. “No!”

“Yes,” Reyana nodded.

“No!”

""My point exactly.""

Rudy threw a crumpled piece of paper at her. She didn't react beyond a slight upturn at the corner of her mouth. ""Wasn’t that the sheet on which you were writing what Dad asked of you?""

""…Oh shit."" Rudy's eyebrow rose. ""Where”

Reyana snapped her fingers.

The paper ignited midair, curling into blackened fragments before it hit the floor.

“Oops,” she said mildly. “My fingers slipped.”

Rudy exhaled through his nose and slumped back in his chair. “Women.”

The temperature dipped.

It was subtle at first, but Rudy felt it immediately. Reyana’s eyebrows lifted by a fraction, her gaze burning on Rudy.

“What was that?” she asked.

Rudy opened his mouth on instinct, then closed it just as fast. Something about her glare reminded him of Amelia. Jin’s cousin, who looked like an angel, but get on her wrong side and she was scarier than a demon. He had learnt that the hard way.

He swallowed.

“What I meant,” Rudy said carefully, hands lifting in surrender, “is that as a man, I am prone to making wrong judgments.”

The cold eased. Slightly.

From the kitchen came the steady hiss of hot oil, followed by Jin’s voice, “Rudy has invested at least several hundred stat points into \[Dumbness\].”

“Hey!” Rudy snapped.

“Well,” Reyana called back without looking away from him, “your plan to fight an Underlord ranker involved an impressive amount of ‘hopefully we don’t die.’...”

“The contingency was ‘don’t die,’” Jin said, his head rising over the half-wall. ""And yet here we all are. Not dead. I'd call that a success.""

""Guys, guys!” Rudy said, straightening with renewed confidence, “Let’s not forget both of you were passed out on the street, and it was me who hauled your arses safe until Joe showed up.”

Reyana clicked her tongue.

“Tch.”

“You’re welcome, by the way,” Rudy added smugly.

""Yeah, you have my undying gratitude for that, bro!"" Jin replied, already disappearing back into the kitchen. “Eternally. Also, food’s almost ready, so save the ego stroking until after you’ve eaten.”

Something aromatic hit the air, rich and sharp enough to make Rudy’s stomach growl loud enough to embarrass him.

""When did you learn how to cook?"" Rudy shifted in his chair. ""I've never seen you do anything in a kitchen except boil water for instant noodles.""

""Joe's teaching me,"" Jin said. ""Says cooking helps with essence control. Something about managing multiple processes at once, and precise timing, translates to better combat spell management. Also, stress relief.""

Reyana and Rudy exchanged glances.

""They're bonding well,"" Reyana said.

""It's weird,"" Rudy whispered.

""Probably.""

""I can still hear you."" He sounded amused.

Rudy leaned closer to Reyana and whispered, “Now he’s talking like Joe.”

He lowered his voice further. “It’s the Joeover virus.”

A small door opened, and books dropped straight down.

“Ow!” Rudy yelped as several hardbound volumes bounced off his head and slid into his lap.

Reyana covered her mouth.

Her shoulders shook once before she looked away, failing spectacularly at hiding her laughter.

◈◈◈

After a couple of minutes, Rudy was focused on finishing his journal entry, which Salvatore insisted on writing, especially after a fight.

Reyana was reading a book when movement from the kitchen caught their attention.

Jin emerged first, and Rudy had to physically bite his tongue to keep from laughing loud enough to be rude.

Jin wore a pink apron. Covered in little cartoon cats with oversized heads and expressions that ranged from cheerful to maniacally happy.

Joe followed a moment later, wearing an identical apron, and the sight of an underlord ranker in a pink cat apron carrying a steaming platter was really absurd.

""Not. One. Word."" Jin pointed a serving spoon at both of them. His expression dared them to comment.

""I wasn't going to say anything."" Rudy lied so badly that even he didn't believe it. The smile threatening to split his face rather undermined the innocent tone.

""The aprons were all I had clean,"" Joe said without any apparent embarrassment, setting his platter on the table. ""And before you ask… yes, they were a gift. No, I don't know why someone thought an Underlord needed cat-themed kitchen wear. Yes, I kept them anyway because they're surprisingly well-made. Good stitching and quality craftsmanship.""

""It suits you,"" Reyana murmured, but her eyes were already tracking the food appearing on the table.

The first platter held a turkey.

Not carved yet. Whole. Skin browned and tight, glossed with fat and herbs, steam still lifting from it in lazy curls that carried the smell of salt, butter, and something roasted long enough to matter.

“This is a Vespra Rooster, high overmortal spirit beast.” Joe set it down with care. Had brined it overnight before storing it in my dimensional storage,” he said. “Kept it simple. Salt, citrus peel, there are spirit herbs though.”

The second platter came next, heavy with sides. Potatoes whipped smooth and pale, butter melting into shallow craters. Green beans cooked just enough to still snap, tossed with garlic and oil instead of being drowned in it. A dish of stuffing dense with bread and onion and sausage, the top crisped dark where it had caught the heat.

“Nothing too fancy,” Joe added, glancing at them. “But after three small kittens won against an Underlord, I had to do at least this much.”

A third dish followed. Ornaberry sauce, tart enough to make your mouth water just looking at it, studded with orange peel. Another plate held thick slices of bread, crusty and torn instead of cut, still warm when Jin set it down.

Joe placed a pitcher. “It’s called orcasun, a delicacy from the eastern lands.”

""You guys made all this in an hour?"" Rudy asked.

""Hour and a half,"" Jin corrected, removing the ridiculous apron and tossing it vaguely toward the kitchen. ""And Joe did most of the work. I just assisted and managed not to burn anything. Low bar, but I cleared it.""

""Cooking is magic."" Joe took a seat at the table. ""Which is just controlled essence reactions with different materials. Once you understand the principles, execution is straightforward. Temperature control, timing, and proper reagent combination. Same skills, different application.""

""That is absolutely not how normal people think about cooking,"" Reyana said.

""I'm not normal person.""

""Fair point.""

They served themselves in silence that felt earned rather than awkward. And for several long minutes, the only sounds were eating noises and the occasional involuntary groan of satisfaction.

Rudy took his first bite of the roasted meat and had to stop. Just stop moving, stop thinking, stop everything except experiencing what was happening in his mouth. ""This is really good.""

“I know now if you are not eating,” Jin said. “I’ll gladly take that off your plate.”

“Oh… hell nah!”

◈◈◈

  
Rudy leaned back after finishing his second helping, one hand on his stomach. ""New rule. After every life-threatening mission, someone has to cook like this. It's mandatory now. I'm making it law.""

""Seconded,"" Reyana agreed. ""Joe hardly cooks. Jin, learn all you can from him…. Though we could skip the life-threatening missions and just have the food?""

""Where's the growth in that?"" Jin asked.

""The not dying part seems like adequate motivation for growth.""

""Details.""

Joe cleared his throat, drawing attention without raising his voice. His expression had shifted from relaxed to something carrying more weight. The casual part of the meal was ending. ""I'm proud of you three.""

Rudy felt something warm expand in his chest. Reyana's hands went still on her utensils. Jin looked sideways, expression unreadable but not quite managing the nonchalance he was going for.

""You took down an Underlord. Not just any Underlord… Nourma was a legitimate threat even by ORDER IV standards. Sure, he may not have a natural aura, but he made up for it with all the blessings."" Joe's gaze moved across each of them in turn, meeting eyes, making sure they understood this wasn't casual praise. ""That means something. More than you probably realize right now.""

""Though,"" and Joe's expression shifted into something more serious, ""I should mention that Threnval escaped.""

""What? Really?"" Jin said.

“I saw your domain... everything was dark and red!"" Rudy said.

“Yeah, Joe. That’s not very like you…” Reyana said with a frown. “You should have killed it.”

""Well,"" Joe sighed, and for a moment looked every one of his years. ""Threnval is a monster. His fighting capabilities were beyond a Lord ranker, and when you factor in divine blessings, connection to the Veil, and pure combat experience... the fight was never guaranteed.""

""We would have to make sure the next time we see him, he is 6 feet under,"" Jin said flatly. “Threnval can access the veil to locate us. We don’t know if there are more cults capable of doing this, but…”

""He will show up, eventually. Probably not for weeks… I wounded him badly, and his connection to the Darkened One was severed during the fight. He'll need time to recover."" Joe's expression turned grim. ""But yes. We need to be more vigilant. We should limit ourselves to travel under a presence suppression spell.""

“Agreed.” Jin nodded.

""That darkness you used,"" Rudy said around the spoon, then pulled it out because talking with utensils in your mouth was apparently rude even underground, ""was that your domain? I've only heard bits and pieces. Dad said domains are... what was the phrase... 'proof of lordship manifest.' That you control everything inside like a god.""

""Not quite like a god. But not entirely wrong either."" Joe's smile was slight but genuine. “The darkness was Threnval’s domain, a very nasty one.”

""A domain is something you need to master to become a Lord rank or ORDER V, whichever terminology you prefer,” Joe said. “Domain is the external manifestation of your Lord sparks, your Mantle, and your path, all crystallized into territory you can impose on reality itself. Inside your domain, normal rules bend to accommodate your nature. Your enemies suffer significant suppression. It's not omnipotence, but it's the closest thing mortals can achieve.""

""But yesterday wasn't a full domain,"" Jin said.

""Correct. Both Threnval and I are one step away from true ascension to Lord rank. We can force a portion of our domains into reality for a limited duration. Bounded fields that have some domain properties but are restricted in scope, power, and sustainability."" Joe made a gesture with his hands, holding something fragile. ""Think of it as a preview. A taste of what's coming. But nowhere near the real thing in scale or capability.""

""And in a full domain?"" Reyana asked.

""In a full domain, Threnval wouldn't have escaped. I would have had complete control over spatial manipulation within the boundaries. His attempts to use the Veil's power would have been suppressed or redirected. The fight would have ended definitively within minutes."" Joe paused, expression distant. ""But I'm not there yet. Neither is he, which is why the fight between us could have gone either way. We're evenly matched right now.""

“Yeah, only if you deployed your domain first,” Jin said.

Joe paused, looking at Jin with a raised eyebrow. “That’s specific, don’t know how you knew that, but yeah, if I managed to catch him in my domain first.”

Jin stood and stretched, joints popping softly as the last of the tension worked its way out of his shoulders.

“Speaking of growth,” he said, “while you two were meditating, Joe and I went over the things that nearly got us killed.”

“And?” Rudy prompted.

“And we fixed and made a couple of new items,” Jin replied.

He lifted a hand, and a box appeared. “Who’s excited for the upgrades!”

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

Sleek, industrial, and available in colors ranging from ""Matte Black"" to ""Candy Apple Red,"" the **Technivorm Moccamaster** is the undisputed icon of the drip coffee world.

But in an era of smart-brewers and app-controlled espresso machines, does this Dutch classic—which hasn't fundamentally changed its internal design since 1968—still hold the crown? As a veteran of the specialty coffee scene, I put the **Moccamaster KBGV Select** through its paces to see if it’s a lifetime investment or just a very pretty countertop trophy.

# The Tech: Why Copper is King

Most cheap drip machines use a thin aluminum heating element that ""burps"" water over your grounds at inconsistent temperatures. This leads to that classic ""office coffee"" taste: bitter, flat, or sour.

The Moccamaster is different. It uses a **heavy-duty copper heating element** that rapidly heats water to the precise SCA-certified range of **196°F – 205°F**.



# Key Specifications:

* **Brew Time:** 4–6 minutes for a full 40 oz (1.25L) carafe.
* **Certification:** Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) & European Coffee Brewing Centre (ECBC).
* **Construction:** Recyclable aluminum housing with BPA/BPS/BPF-free plastics.
* **Origin:** Handmade in the Netherlands.

# Hands-On Experience: The ""Analog"" Ritual

Using a Moccamaster feels less like operating an appliance and more like using a piece of lab equipment. There are no timers, no clocks, and no ""bold"" buttons.

# The Good: Consistency and Longevity

The **KBGV Select** model features a toggle switch for ""Half Pot"" or ""Full Pot."" This isn't just a gimmick; it actually adjusts the water flow and hotplate temperature to ensure that even a small batch meets the ""Gold Cup"" standard.



The build quality is essentially ""tank-like."" Because the machine is modular, every single part—from the spray arm to the internal switches—is replaceable. In a world of planned obsolescence, the Moccamaster is a rare **Buy It For Life (BIFL)** contender.

# The Not-So-Good: The ""Plastic"" Controversy

One common critique is the amount of plastic. While the body is solid aluminum, the water reservoir and brew basket are plastic. While they are high-quality and heat-resistant, some users feel they lack the ""premium"" feel of a $350+ machine. Also, the spray arm, while effective, doesn't always saturate the edges of the coffee bed perfectly—I often find myself giving the grounds a quick stir mid-bloom for better extraction.

# Moccamaster vs. The Competition

|**Feature**|**Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV**|**Breville Precision Brewer**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Control**|Analog (On/Off)|Digital (PID, Flow Rate)|
|**Durability**|Legendary (20+ years)|Moderate (Tech-heavy)|
|**Aesthetics**|Mid-Century Modern|Modern Kitchen Appliance|
|**Warranty**|5 Years|2 Years|
|**Best For**|Purists who want simplicity|Techies who want to tweak|

# The Verdict: Who Should Buy This?

The Moccamaster isn't for everyone. If you need your coffee to start brewing automatically at 6:00 AM via a smartphone app, look elsewhere.

**Buy the Moccamaster if:**

* You prioritize **flavor and temperature precision** above all else.
* You want a machine that will likely last **two decades** rather than two years.
* You appreciate **iconic design** and a quiet, rapid brewing process.

**Skip the Moccamaster if:**

* You need **programmability** or ""smart"" features.
* You are on a tight budget (the $350 price tag is steep).
* You prefer the versatility of brewing espresso-style drinks or cold brew in one machine.",1,1769443180.0,kitchen_gadget,0,1.0,False

I went in with a screwdriver to see if there were any clogs in the filter holder thing, particularly near the drip stop. we’ve done tons of cleaning cycles, unplug and plug back in, etc. I believe it’s some software issue.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

1qnjt6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1qnjt6f/marriage_affair_and_pregnancy_no_idea_what_to_do/,"Marriage, affair and pregnancy; no idea what to do","I married my high school sweetheart, together for 15 years now since 16/17. Moved in together at 18/19. Went to Japan in March 2025 and decided to start trying for kids in April. 

Overall we had a good marriage, common interests and aligned dreams for the future, but his work always seemed to have priority over me, alongside with anger issues from his side. The anger issues were more prominent in the beginning of the relationship, and with time they cooled down, but still popped up every now and then, probably due to stress. 

It pretty much came to a head last October/November and we had 2 pretty massive fights, one about him not wanting to do any activities when we were visiting a city together, and one about me not wanting to help him write up his resume where I ended the fight by punching against a wooden beam in our house, out or pure frustration that he was not listening to me or respecting what I was saying, while I never ever act out physically like this. This was very much not like me at all. It made me see him in a different light and made attraction fade a lot. I had mentioned therapy during this time, but this fell on deaf ears. I did not nag him further about this.

I craved good relationships and intended to look for platonic friendships so that I could meet people and just have more fun in my life. Do outings (like amusement parks) that he never wanted to do, visit museums, etc. I found a group of online friends in November and had been having a blast, great connections and a lot of fun conversations. My husband felt excluded and isolated (he never really had close friends of his own). This made me sad, but at this point I could not really take care of these issues for him anymore, so I told him to try and find his own people, put in more effort to maintain friendly relationships, so that he can have the same as me. He did not take this to heart then. 

But this is the adultery subreddit, so I'm not here to talk about platonic relationships I formed... I got along with one of these new friends really well. We met up for the first time when I was home alone and bored anyway (husband was on business trip), I went to visit him and we had a fun day. Nothing happened, we just had a fun day and got to know each other a bit. Met up again a week or 2 later, to visit some museums in a city that is between where he lives and where I live. Again, just had a fun day where nothing happened. Our chat conversations had gotten a bit more close though, and I was starting to develop some feelings, as was he seemingly. 

Everything felt confusing and guilt had started to build up for me, so I told this friend in December that we should cool things down and that I was married and that everything was just very complicated. He said okay and backed off a bit. My relationship with my husband did not really change during this time, so gradually contact with this friend became more frequent and intimate again. We met up at his to watch movies and he kissed me. I felt butterflies, so I did not stop him.

He makes me feel appreciated and loved, so I kept things going. I've been feeling very guilty when I'm not with AP, because I never wanted to cheat and never imagined I would do so. It has been eating me up. AP has been reassuring me constantly that it is probably for the best to end the marriage, since it wasn't good anymore, but the other side of me says that I do not want to give up 15 years with my husband. We decided to pause our marriage for a bit, so that he can work on his issues and I needed time and space to think. I moved to the spare bedroom and have been here for a few weeks now. I was hoping to be able to make a decision whether or not my marriage could last, apart from my AP. And that with the work my husband was doing on himself (finding friends, working on his abandonment issues), and then couples therapy, that we could come to a close in either direction in a 'healthy' manner and with guidance, but unfortunately this did not happen.

It all pretty much came to a head last Friday. Thursday evening I grabbed a pregnancy test I had laying around, because although my cycles has been out of whack ever since stopping birth control pills, I thought doing a test wouldn't do any harm. Husband noticed I had grabbed the test and asked me about it. Told him not to worry, that I was only taking it to make sure. I didn't believe I was pregnant, so I took the test Friday morning. I was horrified when it came back positive. I hid the test in 'my' room and had planned on spending the day with AP anyway. I left and received a call from my husband that he had gone through my things in my bedroom, because he 'had a feeling' and found the test. Then also decided to go through my computer and read back messages I exchanged with AP. He called me broken that I hid this from him and that I cheated. He asked/demanded that I come back home to talk things over, if I decided to go to AP anyway, then things would be over.

I was already distressed about the positive test and this broke me down. I called AP and came clean to him aswell. We always had protected intercourse, and I did tracking due to trying to have a baby since April, so this is definitely my husband's baby. It happened the last time we had intercourse in December, which also feels like a cruel joke that this would happen at such a time. I feel incredibly conflicted and this adds more shit to the pile...

I spent most of the day in the city that I was in when husband called. Had coffee and lunch and mulled things over. AP came to that city to talk with me and drive me home. I then had a talk with my husband and it was just an emotional mess. I really have no idea what I want anymore, and this baby makes things so incredibly complicated. I am wondering whether things with husband were really all that bad, or that I'm just overreacting and blowing things out of proportion. AP says I'm not (of course) and wants to see/make me happy, and thinks that husband has been severely lacking. 

I have no idea what I'm trying to achieve with this post, but any gentle input is appreciated. Husband is willing to forgive me, but a lot of work will be necessary from both sides. I feel like I will have to give up a lot of freedom for him when we choose to continue, and I doubt he will ever be able to trust me again with any male friends. I am wondering if that's healthy and 'worth it', I guess. AP is a very sweet man, but I've known him for barely 3 months now and I have no idea what kind of person he would be as a roommate or eventually father. He says I bring out the best in him, and I want to believe this, but is this still the case after a few years? My husband is very ambitious (to the point where work was more important than me...) and has a high-earning job. I make more than him, but AP is nothing like this. I worry if I can have the same intellectual conversations with him, especially about work. Husband and I work in the same field, AP doesn't. I wonder if these things matter in a good relationship. I used to think my husband and I were 'made' for each other, because we have the same work and also some shared interests/hobbies, but then again, plenty of couples do not have this and still make it work.

The biggest feeling I have right now, and this is fair to none of the men, is that I want to try my luck with AP, but if that doesn't work out, I would definitely want to try and get back together with husband, which is just ridiculous and I don't expect him to wait around for me. Is it possible to work past all of our issues and be genuinely happy, or is it over and should we cut our losses and see what life brings us? We're both early 30s, so I feel like there is a lot at stake with the wish to have a family...

I have a meeting planned with a therapist tomorrow for the first time. I know they won't give me any answers, but my mental health has been declining since the fights with my husband. ",2,1769442820.0,adultery,2,0.75,False

if you’ve ever tried to find a co-founder, you know the drill: endless coffee chats with people who either ghost you or pitch you on their MLM side hustle. or you post on cofounder dating sites and get 50 messages from people who didn’t even glance at your pitch deck. it’s exhausting, and most of the time, it doesn’t work.



here’s what we’re trying instead:



\- upload your pitch deck, resume, or whatever tells your story

\- say what you’re looking for in plain english (e.g., ""technical co-founder in climate tech"" or ""seed investors who get B2B SaaS"")

\- the AI looks at the whole network and explains why each match makes sense

\- both sides see the context before the first message. no more ""so what do you do?""



it’s not a job board or a founder dating app. the AI actually tries to figure out if you’d work well together. you control what’s visible, so you can share stuff without making it public. and no spam, matches only happen if there’s real alignment.



free to start. we’re not paywalling the matching because we want to see if this actually helps people find each other. if you’ve been through the co-founder search grind, i’d love to hear what sucked and what would’ve made it easier for you.

The sun was just rising over **Elysium Cay**, painting the Bahamian sky in gold and violet, when **Charles Xavier** appeared in the center of the mansion’s grand hall.

Not through a door.  
Not through a portal.

He was simply… *there*.

The Arcana Five froze mid-breakfast. Pancakes hovered in the air. Coffee poured upward into cups.

Luna Tanaka stood first.

“Professor Xavier,” she said carefully. “You found us.”

Xavier smiled gently, resting his hands on his cane.

“Yes,” he replied. “But more importantly… I understand you.”

The **Seven Horsemen** gathered nearby, their illusions dimming out of respect. Aurelian Vox crossed his arms, watching closely.

Xavier continued, his voice calm but heavy.

“The United States has begun hunting super mutants outside its control. Registries. Detention centers. ‘Protective custody,’ they call it.” His eyes darkened. “Children disappear first.”

Naomi swallowed.  
“So… we can’t go home.”

Xavier nodded.

“I am asking you,” he said softly, “to never return to the mainland. Not because you’re criminals—”

“—but because you’re *free*,” Luna finished.

Xavier smiled again.

“I will tell no one where you are,” he promised. “Your mansion will remain a blind spot—even to me.”

With that, he vanished.

The Magic Mansion awakened.

# Chapter 1: The Mansion That Breaks Reality

The mansion was alive.

Not sentient—not exactly—but *aware*.

Its towers bent inward like a kaleidoscope. Staircases led to ceilings. Doors opened into oceans, jungles, deserts, and skies. Gravity politely asked permission before working.

Samir stared at a hallway where the floor slowly became the wall.

“…I’m gonna need a notebook just for this house.”

Rosie laughed as she floated upside down, walking across the chandelier.

“This place is a mood.”

The Horsemen called it **The Magic Mansion**, but its true name was older—woven from Catalyst energy and belief itself.

Every room obeyed one rule:

**Reality is optional.**

# Chapter 2: Growing Small, Growing Large

The first shock came from the **Scale Wing**.

Luna stepped into a corridor barely wider than her shoulders. With every step, the walls stretched—and suddenly she was no taller than her own ankle.

“GUYS,” her tiny voice echoed. “I’M SMALL.”

Eli crouched and squinted.

“…Adorable.”

Then he took one step forward—and grew to ten feet tall.

“WHY AM I HUGE.”

Aurelian explained calmly, sipping tea upside down.

“The mansion responds to self-perception. Feel small? Become small. Feel powerful? Well…”

Rosie flexed dramatically.

“Oh no.”

She grew so large her head poked into the clouds painted on the ceiling—which immediately became *real clouds*.

Adjusting took weeks.

Naomi learned to ground herself emotionally before entering rooms. Samir built wrist devices to stabilize scale shifts. Luna learned to enjoy it—sometimes shrinking to explore mouse-sized libraries hidden between walls.

# Chapter 3: The Threshold Room

The most sacred space was **The Threshold Room**.

A single arched doorway stood at its center, surrounded by glowing symbols that shifted based on climate, temperature, and intention.

Calypso explained it.

“When you step through,” she said, “the mansion reads the environment you *belong* to.”

Luna hesitated.

“What happens if you don’t belong anywhere?”

Seraphine smiled softly.

“Then it shows you where you *could*.”

Luna stepped in.

Water rushed up her legs.

In seconds, she transformed into a **dolphin**, her body sleek and silver-blue, lungs replaced by powerful breath-holding magic. She felt joy—pure, boundless joy—as she swam through a hallway that had become an endless ocean.

Naomi later became a **snow leopard** in an alpine chamber.  
Eli turned into a **falcon**, soaring through inverted skies.  
Rosie became an **octopus**, changing colors mid-laugh.  
Samir transformed into a **desert fox**, ears twitching as he mapped invisible structures.

They didn’t lose themselves.

They *expanded*.

# Chapter 4: A New Life Without Fear

Days settled into a rhythm.

No alarms.  
No sirens.  
No hiding.

The Arcana Five studied magic openly—real magic. Luna learned how belief shaped Catalyst energy. Naomi practiced shadow-weaving without fear of discovery. Samir combined illusion with quantum theory. Rosie performed for the mansion itself, which applauded by rearranging furniture.

At night, they gathered on floating balconies.

Eli leaned back, staring at upside-down stars.

“…Is this what normal feels like?”

Luna nodded.

“I think so.”

They laughed more. Slept better. Dreamed *freely*.

The mansion provided everything—food that appeared when hunger was honest, rooms that changed when emotions shifted, mirrors that showed who you were becoming instead of who you were afraid to be.

# Chapter 5: The Horsemen’s Quiet Guard

The Seven Horsemen never ruled.

They *watched*.

They intercepted satellites with illusions. Redirected ships that drifted too close. Made governments forget coordinates that never existed.

One night, Nikolai reported calmly:

“A mutant task force rerouted itself. They now believe the island sank in 1987.”

No one cheered.

They simply continued living.

# Chapter 6: Luna’s Question

One evening, Luna stood alone in the mansion’s central hall.

“Do we ever go back?” she asked the room.

The mansion responded by opening a door—showing Brockport, frozen in time.

Luna closed it gently.

“…Not yet.”

The mansion shifted, approving.

# Epilogue: Magic Without an Audience

Far away, the world hunted mutants.

But somewhere beyond maps and fear stood a mansion where gravity laughed, children became legends, and magic didn’t need permission to exist.

Charles Xavier never spoke of them again.

And the Arcana Five grew—not in size, but in **truth**.

They were safe.

They were home.

And the Magic Mansion waited patiently for the day the world was ready to believe again. ✨",1,1769442334.0,MarvelFanStory,0,1.0,False

1qnjhl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1qnjhl9/life_changing_49_days/,Life changing (49 days),"I started cutting processed sugar and all processed foods 49 days ago. I had a couple tiny cheats (my sister made me a birthday cake and I had a tiny slice), but overall cutting out sugar has been amazing! 

The biggest change is my skin. I have had mild acne for the last 15 years (worse on my back and chest). My skin has 100% cleared! I am now just using some scar cream on what is left and my skin is almost perfect now. I tried every cream and medication and eating clean made more difference with zero negative side effects. My skin is GLOWING and the dark circles have faded a bit.

My bathroom routine is regular. I rarely feel bloated and I don’t hold water weight. 

My weight was already healthy, but losing the water weight has definitely helped with definition. I am seeing the nice line on my abs. My workouts have been so much better. I have twice the endurance as I did. 

My sleep has gone way up! I wear a Garmin watch and my sleep score went from 80s to mid 90s! My rhr has also gone way down.

I recommend cutting sugar to anyone. I wasn’t always eating candy, a lot of times I thought I was being healthy, but I would snack on Cliff bars or Pirate’s Booty and that would end up being a meal. 

If I had any advice, it would be to not go hungry. Eat lots of vegetables and healthy protein (I eat fruit, too but only a couple serving a day) to stay full and you will have less temptation. If I need a snack, I make kale chips or chickpeas or nuts (but I need to be careful, I went a little crazy in the pecans and they pretty much turn to fat immediately on my body lol). I drink tons of water, tea, and coffee (I add a little sugar free soy milk or drink black).

How do I move forward?","I’ve been with my boyfriend for three years. I’m 30 and he’s 37. I moved to a new city specifically to be with him and build a life together. We live together and also work for the same company (remote/home office), which makes the situation feel even more complicated.

**Lack of intimacy and affection:**  
We haven’t been intimate or even affectionate in about 18 months. No sex, no physical closeness, and very little emotional warmth. He doesn’t compliment me. I’ve cried to him and clearly communicated that I need words of affirmation. When I do, he might give me a forced or half-hearted compliment, but nothing actually changes. What hurts most is that other men regularly compliment me, while the one person I want that from does not.

**Ex-girlfriend involvement:**  
I recently discovered he’s been seeing his ex-girlfriend behind my back. They’ve gone for coffee, gone to the gym together, and he fixed her laptop and downloaded her favorite game for her. On the same day, he told me he couldn’t find the PC charger, accused me of losing it, and rushed me to buy a new one. I later realized the laptop he fixed that day was for her. He also gave her a monitor that I had been using for work.

When I confronted him, he said she “isn’t a priority” and that these were just “a couple of things” compared to all the good things he’s done for me, which he says I don’t notice.

**Future plans and mixed signals:**  
I’ve tried to have serious conversations about the future. When I asked him about marriage, he said, “I see a future with you,” but nothing concrete has ever followed—no plans, no timelines, no steps forward. When we discussed children, he said that if there were a way to skip the baby and toddler years, it would be perfect because he doesn’t know how to act around kids. These conversations left me feeling uncertain about whether we actually want the same life.

I want to acknowledge that I’m not blameless. At one point, I talked to a colleague about our relationship and shared some of our problems because I felt overwhelmed and isolated.He saw the conversations and he said I had betrayed his trust. Since then, this has been used as further proof that the relationship is damaged, but there has still been no effort on his side to address the issues that led me to feel that desperate for support in the first place.

**My question:**  
How do I realistically evaluate whether this relationship can be repaired versus accepting that it’s over, and what are practical steps to disentangle myself emotionally, logistically, and professionally if leaving is the healthier option?

**TL;DR:** I (30F) moved cities for my boyfriend (37M). We’ve had no intimacy or affection for 18 months. He secretly spends time and does favors for his ex while putting no effort into our relationship. He gives vague answers about marriage and kids, made no changes after a “last chance” talk, and says I betrayed his trust for confiding in a colleague. We live and work together, I relocated for him, and I feel stuck. **How do I decide if this is repairable, and how do I practically untangle my life if it isn’t?**",0,1769442123.0,relationships,4,0.5,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

**Prologue: The Demon's Last Stand**

*(Author's Warning: Unlike the usual comedy, this chapter depicts Masanari's past. Expect violence, blood, and zero bidets. The comedy will return tomorrow!)*

The rain tasted of iron.

It was not merely the metallic tang of the storm clouds bruising the skies over the Iga mountains; it was the taste of my own blood, mixing with the mud that caked my face, and the blood of the thirty men I had already killed since sunup.

""Hanzo..."" The voice at my ear was weak, trembling with exhaustion and the biting cold of the altitude. ""Leave me. My weight... slows you.""

I tightened my grip on the legs of the man clinging to my back. ""Silence, my Lord. To suggest I would abandon you is to insult the steel in my veins.""

I am Hattori Masanari. The world knows me as Hanzo the Demon. They whisper that I was born from a shadow, that I eat lightning and breathe poison. They are wrong. I am simply a man who has calculated the physics of death and found the equation to be solvable.

And the solution to today’s equation was simple: Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu must live.

We were at the base of the Devil’s Tooth, a sheer cliff face of slick, moss-covered granite rising two hundred feet into the gray mist. Behind us, the forest floor churned with the boots of pursuers. The Akechi traitor army. The Shadow Corps. They were hunting us like dogs.

I inhaled, expanding my lungs until my ribs strained against my leather breastplate. I channeled my Ki—the internal energy that separates the Shinobi from the samurai—into the soles of my tabiles.

*Analysis: Surface friction coefficient—low due to rain. Slope angle—eighty-five degrees. Required velocity—maximum.*

""Hold your breath, my Lord,"" I whispered.

I ran.

I did not climb. I ran straight up the vertical face of the mountain. Gravity clawed at my cloak, demanding I fall, but my steps were thunderclaps against the stone. One. Two. Three. My legs burned with the fire of a thousand forges. Ieyasu was not a light man, but loyalty makes all burdens weightless.

Arrows shattered against the rock face inches from my head. I didn't flinch. Flinching is inefficient.

With a final, guttural roar, I crested the lip of the cliff and vaulted onto the muddy plateau. I landed in a roll, dispersing the kinetic energy, and gently deposited the future Shogun onto the wet grass.

My remaining subordinates—three battered Iga jonin, their black gear shredded—were already there. They looked at me with eyes wide with terror. Not of the enemy, but of me. Of what I had just done.

""Take him,"" I ordered, my voice grating like a whetstone. ""The pass to Mikawa is two miles east. Go.""

""Lord Hanzo?"" one of them stammered. ""You are not coming?""

I turned back toward the cliff edge. Below, the mist swirled, parting to reveal the torches of the Akechi army. Hundreds of them. And leading them, scaling the paths with supernatural speed, were shadows that moved unlike ordinary soldiers.

""There is a suspension bridge across the gorge,"" I said, drawing my katana. The blade, Shadow-Eater, hummed in the rain. ""I will dismantle it. After I cross to the other side.""

It was a lie. We all knew it. To dismantle the bridge from the far side would take too long. Someone had to hold the choke point. Someone had to be the wall.

Ieyasu grabbed my wrist. His grip was frail, desperate. ""Masanari. Do not die. That is an order.""

I bowed low, my forehead touching the mud. ""I hear and obey.""

I waited until their footsteps faded into the treeline before I stood. I walked onto the swaying suspension bridge. It was old wood and rotting rope, spanning a drop that swallowed sound.

I stood in the center. I closed my eyes. I slowed my heart rate to four beats per minute.

*State: Calm.*

*Ammunition: Six kunai. One smoke bomb. Thirty feet of razor-wire.*

*Objective: Total annihilation.*

The first enemy crested the ridge. Then ten. Then fifty. They saw the lone figure on the bridge—a silhouette in a tattered scarf, motionless in the rain—and they paused. Instinct warned them.

""Kill him!"" an officer screamed. ""Take his head for Lord Akechi!""

They charged. A wave of steel and shouting men.

I opened my eyes.

*Execute.*

I didn't move my feet. I flicked my left wrist. The razor-thin steel wires I had pre-laid across the bridge railings snapped taut.

The first six men didn't realize they were dead until their torsos slid off their legs.

Blood sprayed like a geyser, painting the rain red. The soldiers behind them slipped on the gore, tumbling into the abyss.

""Demon!"" someone shrieked.

I stepped forward. My katana was a blur of motion, a silver fan reflecting the lightning. I did not slash; I flowed. I parried a spear thrust and redirected it into the throat of the swordsman next to it. I sidestepped an overhead smash, severing the attacker’s tendons with a precision that would make a surgeon weep.

*Technique: Art of the Firebird.*

I bit the capsule in my mouth, spewing high-combustion oil into the air, and struck my sword against my flint-embedded gauntlet.

*BOOM.*

A cone of fire engulfed the bridge. Men screamed as the flames consumed them, but I was already moving through the inferno, a wraith of smoke and steel. The heat didn't bother me. The fire was my ally. It blinded them. It panicked them.

I was dancing in hell.

A spear grazed my cheek. I grabbed the shaft, snapped it, and drove the splintered wood into the wielder’s eye socket. Another tried to tackle me; I used his momentum to flip him over the railing. His scream lasted a long time.

Fifty men. Sixty. The pile of bodies was becoming a barricade in itself. My breath came in ragged gasps, but my arm did not tire.

*Calculus update: Enemy morale breaking. Victory probability: 94%.*

Then, the wind changed.

The smell of blood was suddenly cut by the scent of ozone and crushed pine needles. The screaming soldiers fell silent, parting like the Red Sea.

From the ranks of the terrified infantry, a figure emerged. He wore a mask of white porcelain—a smiling fox. He carried no sword, only two large, curved sickles.

He moved, and the air screamed.

*Vacuum slash?*

I threw myself backward, my back hitting the wet planks. An invisible blade of compressed air sliced through the space I had occupied a microsecond before, shearing through three wooden support beams as if they were paper.

The bridge groaned, tilting precariously.

I kip-up to my feet, my eyes narrowing. ""Wind Release... Kamaitachi style."" I spat blood onto the deck. ""The Fuma Clan. Why are mercenaries of the Hojo aiding the traitor Akechi?""

The Fox Mask tilted his head. ""Coin is coin, Hanzo. And your head is worth a kingdom.""

He vanished.

No—he moved faster than the eye could track. But not faster than the mind could predict.

*Left flank. Air displacement.*

I ducked, slashing upward blindly.

*CLANG*.

My sword met his sickle. Sparks showered us. He was strong. Unnaturally strong.

""You are slow, Demon,"" the Fuma assassin taunted, spinning in mid-air to deliver a kick to my ribs.

I took the hit. I let my ribs crack. It was a calculated trade.

As his foot connected, I clamped my arm around his ankle.

""I am not slow,"" I whispered, looking into the eyeholes of his mask. ""I am patient.""

I drove a kunai straight up, under the guard of his greaves, severing the Achilles tendon.

He shrieked—a sound less human than bird-like. As he faltered, I spun, channeling the last of my chakra into my blade.

*Secret Art: Moon-Cutter.*

My sword passed through his neck. The porcelain mask fell away, revealing a face frozen in shock, before the head tumbled into the gorge.

I stood alone on the bridge. My body was a tapestry of lacerations. My left eye was swollen shut. My chakra reserves were critically low.

""Is that all?"" I roared at the remaining army, raising my broken sword. ""Send more! I have not yet begun to—""

The air grew heavy. The rain stopped falling. It didn't cease; it froze in mid-air. Droplets hung suspended like diamonds.

A slow clap echoed from the cliffside.

A man in purple robes floated—actually hovered—above the terrified soldiers. He held no weapon. In his hand, he clutched a jagged, pulsating crystal the size of a human heart. It glowed with a sickly, violet light that made my vision swim.

""Impressive,"" the Sorcerer said. His voice didn't travel through the air; it vibrated inside my skull. ""Truly, the Hattori are a pestilence upon history.""

""Who are you?"" I growled, bracing my feet.

""A servant of the outcome,"" he said. He raised the crystal. ""Lord Akechi does not require your death, Hanzo. Death makes martyrs. Death inspires vengeance.""

The violet light intensified. The wood of the bridge began to groan, not from weight, but from age. It was rotting before my eyes, turning to dust in seconds.

""He requires your absence.""

The Sorcerer crushed the crystal.

*Warning. High-level threat. Void Magic.*

A tear in reality opened beneath my feet. It was not black; it was a swirling vortex of colors that should not exist. It pulled with the force of a collapsing star.

I tried to jump. I tried to throw my grappling hook. But physics had abandoned me. Up was down. Time was a liquid.

""This is not the end!"" I screamed, the sound torn from my throat as gravity inverted. ""I will return! I will hunt you through the hells!""

""Go to a place where shadows are forgotten,"" the Sorcerer whispered.

The bridge disintegrated.

I fell.

I fell through the violet abyss. The cold was absolute. It stripped the warmth from my blood, the air from my lungs. I saw flashes of nonsensical images: towering castles of glass, metal beetles rushing along gray rivers, lights brighter than the sun.

My consciousness began to fracture. My last thought was of Ieyasu’s back. \*I failed. I failed.\*

The darkness consumed me.

**THUD.**

The impact was hard, flat, and hot.

I gasped, my lungs filling not with the clean air of the mountains, but with a thick, acrid soup of exhaust fumes and frying oil.

I scrambled to my feet, Shadow-Eater raised in a defensive stance, adrenaline flooding my system.

""Come and die!"" I bellowed.

There was a screech of rubber. A blinding light washed over me. A massive metal beast, yellow and black, roared directly at me, stopping only inches from my knees.

""Hey! Watch where you're walking, you cosplay freak!"" a voice shouted from the belly of the beast.

I blinked. The rain was gone. The silence was gone.

I stood in the center of a canyon, but the cliffs were made of glass and steel, reaching high enough to scrape the heavens. Around me, thousands of people—dressed in bizarre, colorful rags—stared at me. The ground was black stone, marked with white stripes.

Massive glowing tapestries hung in the sky, moving with pictures of women and food. The noise was a physical wall—a cacophony of beeps, music, and voices.

I lowered my sword. My hands were shaking.

*Analysis: Unknown location. Unknown era. Unknown threat level.*

I looked up at the sky. There were no stars. Only the blinding, artificial glow of a sign that read: SHIBUYA 109.

""Where..."" I whispered, the blood dripping from my armor onto the pristine asphalt. ""Where in the six hells am I?""

I must've been nigh on 10 pairs into my Nicks journey when I realized I had exactly zero wedge soles and zero roughout. I always enjoyed the clean, traditional look of the smooth side of the hide and the classic leather heel stack, and, well, I'm a downright pathologically obsessive little creature of habit sometimes.



But I'd also just recently changed continents and careers, and I was starting to get into this whole leaving your comfort zone thing. Plus the opportunity to demo the new Nicks wedges and try a prototype 55 last wedge was too good to pass up – but that's a story I've shared here enough times.



Fast forward close to three years and a new pair of soles, and they're hands-down my most-worn pair. Around town, on lighter hikes, on the most sweltering dog days of summer, in a snowstorm. They're a breeze to drive stick with. Dressed down with the most beat to crap pair of jeans I own, polished up with a blazer and chinos. Everyday awesomeness.



A little back story on the resole: I'd originally only gone with the black Christys since the dude I took them to had those in stock, as opposed to waiting another week for white or sand. But holy smokes, between the waxing and the black soles, I feel like they really only fully came into their own within the last year. Even the contrast of the original tan midsole is just \*perfection\*.

I've found a couple of lists of file types to add to Qbittorrent's ""exclude"" option. These help make the download a little lighter and block downloading some nefarious files. See the list below if you're interested. And no, I have no idea what most of these are.

But I noticed a couple of subtitle file types are on this list, and I don't want to block those.

So which are the subtitle files? I know .SCR is. And I assume .SCRIPT. But any others?

here are my details btw for your reference:

* height: 1.83 m
* weight: 72 kg
* i usually wear size L and XL for t-shirts and sweatshirts, and w33 for pants.

Sharing my few treasure from my collection and also for the memories on the special day.

Let me share some small notes of my usage of these frags - -

\*\*1. Nishane Hacivat\*\* - One of my favourite all time freshie perfumes. This Frag is the sole reason for building love for Nishane and then collecting them. From the citruses with pineapple from top to the woody oakmoss, this performs and smells delightful.

\*\*2. Sospiro Contralto\*\* - The perfume bottle's colour does represents it's identity well. Super vibrant and full of life. Opens up with slight spicy peppers and white florals and goes Vanilla and dense on skin. Proper unisex scent.

\*\*3. Spiritca Atmayatra\*\* - Now this was a complete surprise and gamble of a buy. The super sweet minty opening with greeny mix and aromatics from cardamom, Patchouli does make this smell very good. Stays long on my skin and feels premium.

\*\*4. Parfums De Marly Greenley\*\* - An amazing green apple based freshie that just lingers on my skin throughout and reminds of all types of citruses mix and then goes greeny earthy and woody.

\*\*5. Maison Francis Kurkdjian Grand Soir\*\* - One of the simple note breakdown but feels so rich and poised. Stays slightly smoked Ambery Vanilla and linear to my usage and it's just a perfect unisex wear scent that creates a close range good smelling bubble.

\*\*6. BornToStandOut Drunk Maple\*\* - Smells like an eatery item. Spicy boozy accord with dark coffee and vanilla. A niche and a delight for the cooler or evening wear. Gets good head turns.

\*\*7. Ibraq White Regent Diamond\*\* - Budget based and versatile sweet tea based scent. Starts fresh then goes woody and earthy. Somehow reminds me of a mix of many frags. Another unisex one and an all weather scent to me.",47,1769441350.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,14,0.98,False

There’s chemistry, we get along well and we see each other a lot usually around three times a week. Sometimes it’s dinner or coffee sometimes it’s just hanging out at his place. It doesn’t feel like it’s only about hooking up which is what makes this harder to understand. What’s throwing me off is the inconsistency and lack of clarity. Some days he’ll text me nonstop all day every day other times he’ll go a full day without saying a word. I finally asked where this was headed because after three months, I don’t think that’s an unreasonable question. He just didn’t respond to it. Not even a vague answer we kept talking after like the question never happened.  
  
That silence kind of said more than any answer could. I’m starting to feel like I’m investing time, energy and emotional space into something that might never be defined because it’s convenient for him to keep it that way. I don’t want to push or force someone into choosing me but I also don’t want to sit in limbo hoping things eventually become clear.  
  
It makes me wonder if dating has always been this ambiguous or if we’re just more aware now of how much emotional labor gets wrapped into these situationships.

1qniwas,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1qniwas/the_kdrama_obsession_why_i_cant_tear_myself_away/,The K-Drama Obsession: Why I Can’t Tear Myself Away,"Every day, I sit down to write my daily blog post and remind myself that I need to do SO MUCH reading. I could be working on my book, catching up on sleep, or tackling my never-ending to-do list. But instead, what am I doing? Bingeing K-dramas on Netflix! 🎬

I must confess, I’m addicted to Asian dramas and anime. Apparently, I’m not the only American who has been swept away by the K-pop wave. Just the other day, I saw a TurboTax commercial that looked straight out of a K-pop music video! It’s clear that K-pop's influence has permeated various aspects of American culture. Even our kids are obsessed with K-pop-inspired shows and animated series like ""Demon Hunters.""

The Allure of K-Dramas

But what is it about these films and dramas that makes them so captivating? Let’s explore some of the key factors that contribute to their immense popularity:

1. Compelling Storylines: K-dramas are known for their intricate plots that often weave together romance, humor, and unexpected twists. According to a 2021 Statista survey, over 50% of viewers cited engaging storylines as a major reason for their K-drama obsession. With stories ranging from heartwarming romantic comedies to thrilling historical dramas, there’s something for everyone. For instance, ""Crash Landing on You"" became a phenomenon not just for its romance but also for its exploration of dynamics between North and South Korea.

2. Relatable Characters: The characters are often well-developed, making it easy to connect with their struggles, dreams, and relationships. A 2022 report noted that 40% of K-drama fans felt a strong emotional connection to the characters, which enhances their viewing experience. Characters like the ambitious yet relatable female leads resonate with viewers, showcasing their vulnerabilities alongside their strengths. 

3. Cinematic Quality: The production quality is impressive, with beautiful cinematography and well-choreographed scenes that make each episode a visual treat. Netflix reported a 60% increase in K-drama viewership between 2020 and 2021, underscoring the demand for high-quality content. Shows like ""Kingdom"" have not only captivated audiences with their gripping narratives but also set a new standard for production values in streaming content.

4. Cultural Richness: K-dramas offer a glimpse into Korean culture, traditions, and values, which can be both educational and fascinating for viewers. A survey by the Korean Film Council found that 76% of viewers appreciated the cultural elements presented in these dramas. From traditional clothing to food and family dynamics, K-dramas provide a rich tapestry of cultural insights that many viewers find intriguing.

The K-Pop Connection

The K-pop phenomenon has undoubtedly fueled the popularity of K-dramas. With the rise of groups like BTS and BLACKPINK, the global interest in Korean culture has skyrocketed. The 2020 Global K-Pop Market Report estimated that the industry generated approximately $5 billion in revenue, showcasing its significant economic impact. The crossover appeal of K-pop stars into acting roles has also helped bridge the gap between music and television, drawing in fans from both realms.

America’s Lag in the Industry

It makes me wonder: how has America fallen so far behind in this industry? While Hollywood has produced countless blockbusters, K-dramas have captured the hearts of audiences globally, including here in the U.S. According to Nielsen, K-dramas accounted for nearly 10% of all content viewed on Netflix in 2021, indicating a significant shift in viewer preferences. This begs the question: why are K-dramas resonating so strongly with American audiences?

Diversity in Storytelling: K-dramas often explore themes that may not be as prevalent in Western media, such as the importance of family, societal pressures, and the nuances of love and friendship. This fresh perspective can be a breath of fresh air for viewers seeking something different.

Emotional Authenticity: Many K-dramas prioritize emotional storytelling, allowing viewers to experience a range of feelings—from laughter to tears. This authenticity resonates deeply, making K-dramas feel more relatable and impactful.

A Culinary Connection

As I indulge in my latest binge, I can’t help but crave cheesy, crabby ramyeon 🍜—a staple comfort food often featured in these dramas. It’s become a ritual: cozying up with a bowl of delicious noodles while immersing myself in the latest plot twists and romantic developments. Interestingly, the popularity of Korean cuisine has surged alongside K-drama viewership. A 2021 report found that searches for Korean recipes on platforms like Pinterest increased by 200%, showing how intertwined these cultural phenomena have become.

Moreover, ramen noodle locations are popping up across the nation, bringing authentic Korean flavors to more people. From trendy ramen shops in major cities to food trucks serving up delicious bowls, it’s never been easier to get a taste of the comfort food that K-drama characters enjoy. 

You can also find Korean snacks and products, like the popular coffee candy Kopiko, available on Amazon and in various stores. This accessibility makes it easier for fans to indulge in their favorite K-drama snacks, enhancing the overall viewing experience.

Conclusion: Join the K-Drama Wave

So, as I dive back into my latest K-drama, I’ll leave you with this: if you haven’t yet explored the world of K-dramas, now is the perfect time! You might just find yourself hooked, craving not only the stories but also the delightful snacks that accompany them. 

Whether you’re in the mood for a romantic comedy, a thrilling historical saga, or a heartwarming family drama, K-dramas offer a diverse array of options that are sure to entertain. 

Happy watching! 🌟

1qniw3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/1qniw3j/how_to_get_hired_in_this_economy/,How to get hired in this economy,"I've been out of the workforce since COVID as I started my own business which I've recently sold. I want some stability and regular income so I'm back on the grind of finding a 9-5 and thought I'd share some top tips for getting hired because this market *sucks*.

For context, I'm a senior cyber security professional with 15+ years experience and this is what has worked well for me. Your milage may vary but I believe these are universal regardless of your experience.

1. 50%+ of all job postings are fake. This is even more true for junior / graduate roles. They're mostly used to collect data and for external signalling (if you're hiring you must be growing). Keep this in mind.
2. **Quality over quantity.** Don't apply for 100s of jobs. This is the bare minimum and 100s of people are doing exactly the same. You need to stand out. Do some research and find companies you actually want to work for. Use LinkedIn and search for people who have recently been hired (<3m) there to double check they are actively recruiting.
3. I won't talk about your CV much as there's lots of advice out there. But you need to tailor it to every single role you apply for. This sounds tedious, but with AI you can do this pretty quickly now. Create a base CV just for your eyes with all of your details, skills, experience, achievements, etc. and feed it to Claude (I find it's better than ChatGPT) along with the jobs description and any other relevant resources, e.g., I will add any security/data policies I find, annual reports, or personal blog/ramblings of seniors online. Making it tailored to them and creating a personal touch note will set you apart.
4. Where you can help it, do not apply through LinkedIn or other job sites. You will go in to an ATS pile with 100s of other applicants and probably get filtered out before a human even sees your CV. Instead, spend 15 minutes researching who the hiring manager is or who has the budget (e.g., CISO/CTO for me) and email them. Keep it short and professional; along the lines of ""Are you the lead on the X role in Y? I'm a Z (brief summary of you). Would love to chat if so.

5. The **ultimate hack** is email companies who are *NOT* hiring. Sounds counterintuitive? This is actually how I just landed my most recent role. Search for external growth signals in the industry you want to work in. Follow the team on LinkedIn, see what their posting, etc. For me, I was keeping an eye on fund raising activity of tech companies in London. This works because new raise = need to show growth and signal to investors. It's a tedious process to create a job role, work out the budget, write the job description, get sign-off, etc. especially in large companies. Get ahead of that and email them directly. At the very least you'll get a ""we'll keep your CV"". As an example, I emailed the Head of Security from Synthesia (video AI company) after their $200m fund raise and managed to have a quick chat with him and found they will have budget in the next 2 months. My opener is a little personal (""I've been watching you guys"") but also gets them thinking (""oh yeah, we should probably think about increasing our security posture""). This is exactly how I get my recent role (for another AI company); cold email > 15m chat over the phone > dropped near their office and grabbed a coffee with their head of > 3 x formal interviews > hired. Here's what that e-mail looked like;

I’m in the early stages of planning a small coffee shop and trying to be realistic about where to spend mental energy.

I keep hearing about customers using AI assistants, voice tools, or chat-based systems to place orders instead of traditional apps or websites. I’m honestly on the fence about whether this is something worth even keeping in mind right now, or if it’s just noise.

From people who run shops or work closely with them, I’d love honest takes:

• If you were opening today, would you *ignore* AI/agent-based ordering completely, or at least keep it in the back of your mind?

• Does this kind of tech feel like something that could simplify things long-term, or just another layer of complexity?

• What would make it a hard no for you?

• Are there early signals you’d watch for before taking it seriously?

• Or is the right answer simply “focus on making great coffee and forget the rest”?

I'm literally still trying to process what just happened. I will try to explain the best I can!


I was in my kitchen in (mods are forcing me to Dox myself) Texarkana, AR making a cup of coffee when my dogs started acting crazy.


They usually are high-energy and crazy in the mornings, but this morning was extremely unusual.


I tried to calm the dogs the best I could with dog food and treats. They wouldn't accept either. They just barked and danced around them as if they were a threat to them.


After a few minutes of being freaked out and trying to comprehend what was going on, they suddenly stopped and fell to the floor. Unconscious. I have 3 adult dogs and 2 puppies from a recent litter we had we were still trying to find good homes for. All 5 dogs dropped like flies. All in unison.


My heart started racing at this point like WTF JUST HAPPENED?!


It didn't have very long to race unfortunately. My heart actually froze once I started hearing HIM outside my kitchen window.


I saw the glowing eyes first. He had a reddish-brown fur coat. We just had a bad ice storm over the weekend, and at first I thought it might have been the legendary Bigfoot.


Oh how I was wrong. I was very, VERY wrong.


I finally recognized who this terrifying creature was. I knew the moment he turned towards me and looked straight into my soul.


Like a movie, every sin I ever committed played right before my eyes in a matter of seconds. I was frozen. I couldn't blink. I couldn't breath. I swore I was about to be dragged to hell in the human flesh.


Then I remembered reading a story on reddit where a woman was in the middle of being abducted by aliens, and when she started calling out to Jesus, the aliens left her alone and never messed with her again.


I didn't just start saying Jesus, I was SCREAMING IT.


All of a sudden, my dogs woke up and were back to their normal selves. I turned from my window to watch them as they happily jumped up on me wanting kisses.


I turned back towards the window and Satan was gone.


I turned back towards my dog and that's when I saw him through the window of my back door.


I crouched down and took the best picture I could through the window.


Like I said, this just happened less than an hour ago! (Now longer thanks to career reddit mods) I'm still shaking! Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this before?


How annoying are reddit mods though. Move out of your mom's basement and get a life. You're probably going to unpublish my post because your feelings got hurt you over-grown toddler mamas boy.",0,1769440792.0,Humanoidencounters,10,0.5,False

I bought it used a couple years ago, only used triple filtered water, but then started using a britta for 2 months once I moved. The milk froth was never great and then turned non existant. I've been wanting a Rancillo or Lelit to upgrade to but I don't have the funds yet, and still wondering if it would even help.

So I went crazy with cleaning my machine. I've descaled a few times but never noticed it did anything. This time I just filled the tank with vinegar. Over the course of the day I ran it several times and used the steamer for several minutes thru several cool down periods.

Then I flushed the tank a few times again with clean water to get leftover vinegar out. Pulled the group head out and cleaned it (literally the first time ever)

So let me put this question to the majority shareholders... YOU!","So for those who don't know, in 2021, Aterian entered into a deal with ""9830 MacArthur"" where they purchased brands like Mueller, Pursteam, Pohl and Schmitt and Spiralizer.

When they purchased Mueller, they didn't purchase the entire brand, only the rights to a handful of SKU's, 9830 MacArthur (or whomever now operates/owns the assets) is still allowed to sell the SKU's Aterian didn't purchase in the deal under the Mueller brand name (Partly why Aterian changed the SKU's they sell under this brand to ""Mueller Living"" and not solely ""Mueller"")

When the deal was made, it was specified that neither party could sell competing products... Until after December 31, 2024. (i.e, 9830 MacArthur couldn't sell Aterian the Mueller kettle SKU and then immediately make a new kettle SKU that competes with the one they'd just sold Aterian.)

https://preview.redd.it/pjxjq5e9bpfg1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9537567a2d9bef443fd1178ac61ade0678c34fc

After that date passed, guess what 9830 MacArthur did?

https://preview.redd.it/y4soqotscpfg1.png?width=2516&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea6db95c2b4cbe55835f48d4c29d03dd9530ad6c

That's right, they made a new Mueller kettle SKU. This product is currently the 15th best-selling kettle on Amazon, where as Aterian's Mueller living kettle currently sits at #33.

But my question isn't about the kettles, it's about veg choppers...

This is 9830 MacArthur's listing for veg choppers:

https://preview.redd.it/sco6v29vdpfg1.png?width=2514&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebf21de2365a09517ad781c6993267769b9a65d7

This is another one they have:

By using the current ""bought in past month"" numbers Amazon provides and the currently listed prices, including every variation they are selling (that's the different colours and blade sizes available on the listing) we can calculate that currently per month, these two listings combined are generating **$1,328,037** revenue per month for 9830 MacArthur, that's **$3,984,111 per Qtr**

**Margins etc.etc. aside, that is potentially the difference between Aterian being a profitable business and not.**

**So please, tell me this, now that Aterian legally can, why are they not jumping on these sitting ducks and manufacturing 6, 8, 9 and 12-blade Mueller Living veg choppers to compete with these best-selling Mueller ones and hopefully take a slice of the revenue?** 

The beyond crazy thing is that Aterian, up until about 8 months ago, did have the rights and used to sell a Mueller Living 4-blade veg chopper that had 35k+ reviews and would regularly have ""1k+ bought in the past month""

Why have Aterian stopped selling it all together? I can't get an answer and it's becoming sus... not least because 9830 MacArthur or whomever the current owner of the assets is, is very... shall we say, dodgy...

The Amazon seller accounts/owners of the current Mueller listings, if you investigate their listed business addresses/company names has a whole shell company/tax evasion/stolen identity rabbit hole to go down....

https://preview.redd.it/omsmmkq4kpfg1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=471fd32614e42163f4f5b64e7f09ce1b56a0fd9b

But unless anyone at Aterian is getting backhanders in exchange for not making competing products, that's not really our concern.

I understand that there has been a shift to focus on consumable products now and away from hard goods manufactured in China for tariff concerns, but this isn't an electronic good that Aterian said a complete pause was put on and Aterian does still sell these Mueller Living Mandoline Slicers which manufacturing wise can't be all that different?

It's just baffling to me that we have a SKU sitting here that has such a high revenue potential, for a listing we have already built up with over 35k+ reviews and yet for some strange reason, we are not taking the bull by the horns and (now that we legally can) making competing variations of the product, not only that, but choosing not to sell the product anymore at all.

I have emailed this question to a high up at Aterian (who on previous ocassions was great and replied very swiftly to questions I had but when it came to this message has not responded at all)

I went through the official channel and sent this question to investor relations... no reply.

I have submitted this question for the last 3 earnings report investor questions and it hasn't been answered.

No funding.  
No co-founder.  
No big launch.

Just me, a lot of coffee, and slow compounding.

When I started, I thought growth would come from shipping faster or adding more features. That wasn’t it.

The real shift happened when I stopped treating growth like a one-time event and started treating it like a system.

I’m a technical founder, so instead of doing things manually, I automated as much as possible, especially content. I published consistently, even when traffic was basically zero. Month one felt pointless. Month two was slightly less pointless. Then suddenly organic signups started showing up every day.

One article ended up driving a huge chunk of traffic completely by accident. It wasn’t a keyword I would’ve picked manually. That was the moment it clicked for me: SEO rewards consistency way more than “perfect ideas”.

Another thing that helped a lot was staying close to early users. I answered every message, fixed bugs fast, and asked why people signed up (and why they didn’t). A few of those early users ended up becoming my best promoters.

I’m still very early. This isn’t life-changing money yet. But it’s real, growing, and predictable, which honestly feels better than a one-day spike ever could.

Next goal is $3k MRR.

# THE CHASE IS BACK!

NR2003 AutoStages v4 is a fully automated stage racing companion app for NR2003 offline AI or online sessions, meticulously designed to simulate the authentic NASCAR experience. It's been about two years since the last release as I've worked on my other iRacing projects, but excited to bring you a new release for 2026.

With this latest update, I am proud to announce the full implementation of NASCAR's 2026 'The Chase' format across all Season Modes! This includes this year's all-new points battle - 10 races for Cup, 9 for the O'Reilly Auto Parts Series, and 7 for the Craftsman Truck Series - plus the updated 55-point win bonus, a single points reset and the removal of playoff points and round-by-round eliminations. AutoStages season tracking works in online sessions with a mix of human and AI drivers as well. 


\-----------------------

# NEW features for AutoStages v4:

**Implementation of the 2026 ""The Chase"" Format:** Experience the 2026 NASCAR championship format. This includes the move to a cumulative points battle, the removal of round-by-round eliminations, and the new 55-point win bonus.

**Season Mode Overhaul:** The season tracking system has been completely overhauled from top to bottom and ported directly from iRacing AutoStages. All configuration files are saved in easy-to-read and editable .xml format which will allow for a much more stable season experience. Race totals and season statistics can be quickly modified for greater customization and protection against any potential issues. Configuration files are backed up before the end of every race, allowing you to re-run a season as necessary. 

**Custom Stage and Race Options:** Fully customizable stage options are now available! You can now choose 2, 3 or 4 stage races from a single exe. Determine exactly how long your stages will be or AutoStages to select lengths for you. Toggle stage break cautions on or off for every stage. Want a three-stage race with a caution after the first, but just score points for stage 2 without a break? You can do that.

**One App for Everything:** All features for AutoStages v4 are handled within one .exe. No need to switch between apps for different race options and Season modes anymore.

**Modern Results & Standings Overhaul:** A complete visual refresh for HTML outputs. Results now feature color-coded branding for each series and automatically highlight statistical leaders for greater readability.

**Random Cautions:** Generate unpredictable yellow flags during your races for greater strategy. Set a minimum and maximum number of possible random cautions for your race and AutoStages will throw a random number of yellows within that range throughout your race. Specified laps are hidden from the user. Random cautions will not occur directly after any scheduled stage break cautions.

**Single Stage Racing:** New scoring logic for running a Single-Stage format without stage points or stage breaks - perfect for dedicated statistics tracking, sprint races or shorter custom events.

\-----------------------

# Three NASCAR Season Formats:

AutoStages is the only application that fully implements NASCAR’s major 2026 championship overhaul. Experience the return of ""The Chase"". Say goodbye to round-by-round eliminations and playoff points. v4 features the new single points reset followed by a battle to the season finale.

**Cup Series:** 26-race regular season with a 10-race Chase (16 Drivers).

**O'Reilly Auto Parts Series:** 24-race regular season with a 9-race Chase (12 Drivers).

**Craftsman Truck Series:** 18-race regular season with a 7-race Chase (10 Drivers).

**Season-Long Stat Tracking:** AutoStages now tracks performance metrics that persist across your entire schedule, allowing you to identify who is truly dominating the field.

**Championship Milestones:** Automatically logs the most important stats for every driver: Wins, Top 5s, Top 10s, and Stage Wins.

**Performance Metrics:** Automatically logs Laps Led, Average Finish Position, Quality Passes, and Green Flag Passes and Fastest Lap bonus points.

\-----------------------

1qnir5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1qnir5z/reunion/,Reunion,"Here I am. Talking to you in my head. It's always been easier to be honest this way. 

Waiting for your arrival, I sit quietly on the bench. Through the silence my heart flutters, jumps, shatters, and gets rearranged once more. Each bus that passes with the possibility of holding you stuns my heart. 

When your bus stops and the doors slide open, your flat-soled shoes hit the steps softly, warmly--that same way you float through life. You're wearing a navy sundress with white dots, carrying a brown leather handbag. A face dusted with freckles, and eyes that hold a wisdom often mistaken for naivety. You can't see me yet. Fidgeting, your fingers play with the green emerald dangling from your neck. 

I walk up to you, feeling pale with my shoulders sunk. A smile, open and welcoming, spreads across your face; you fail to put me at ease. 

""Hey!"" you say.

""Hi"" I say, almost whispering. I make myself cough. ""Hi"" I repeat through a smile. 

As we walk around, I ask you about your job, about your life, about your plans. Your words and sentences sound muffled from behind the sharp burning of my heart. You don't seem to notice, though.

Along the narrow sidewalks, interrupted every few meters by spherical olive trees, we walk in a wave--side-by-side, then forced apart, and back together.

""Look at this place!"" You point to a coffee shop bordered by wooden seats with Arabic majlis-style cushioning on top. As you pick out our seats, you sit me down and tell me that you just need to go back to the bathroom real quick. Sitting there, all alone, I can feel the dark sea on which my heart floats, rocking gently from side to side riding the waves like a buoy. You come back, smiling. 

Looking into your eyes as you sit next to me on the ottoman, I realize that I miss you. I miss you now. So much. 

""How've you been feeling? Like, really?"" You ask. 

""I've been okay."" I can feel the salty ocean water condensate into my eyes. 

“You don’t really seem like it. You can talk to me, you know that, right?”

""I'm sorry I've been away for a while. I'm sorry I stopped talking for a long time. It's just these few months have been rough.""

The edges of your eyes relax in acceptance. 

""Oh, it's okay. These things happen.""

How can I tell you that I've shut myself off from the world? That I've pushed everyone away because I'm terrified?

Please hug me. Fix me. Mend me.

""God. It's so complicated.""

A tear escapes. Now that the door's open, more follow. 

You don't know this, but this moment will play and replay in my head. 

""Hey, it's okay. I'm here."" You say.

I bury my face in the palms of my hands. 

Don't be nice to me. Don't start acting like this isn't pathetic. Don't pity me. I'm not fucking weak. You can't imagine what I go through.

""I'm just tired."" 

I can see something change in your eyes. I should have never let you see me cry. I can't let you see me anymore. But please see me now.

""I can see that you are."" You say.

Thank you. Thank you.

""The thing is, I know what's wrong. I know what I need to realize. But knowing and realizing are worlds apart."" I say, trying to pick up the shattered pieces of my dignity that spilled over the floor.

""I know what that's like. Where knowing is just another source of pain, because if I know and still suffer, what can I do?""

""Exactly! Hahaha. Stupid brain.""

""It can be stupid sometimes.""

A few moments of me sniffling fills the silence.

""You wanna go get some ice cream? Ice cream always helps."" You say.

I nod, picking up the scattered tissues that I used to clean up my snot. ""Ice cream is awesome"" I say, ""Let's hope they're still open.""

We grab some ice cream, you pick out chocolate fudge and I get cheesecake, and head to the bus stop. You had that college application due that day. 

From the window of the bus, you wave at me with that smile that feels like sunshine. I stand there, alone.",1,1769440555.0,writers,1,1.0,False

One woman had a migraine and needed assistance finding a chair downtown to sit down as she was falling over from dizziness (hint, there werent seats downtown for dizzy unhoused people to sit). Her biggest wish was for some excedrin.

One gentleman is not homeless, yet. He is currently living with a friend he met in AA. Unfortunately,  that friend is in treatment and his housing will be gone in less than 30 days. This man's biggest worry wasnt the state of being homeless. It was relapsing in 30 days and losing his recovery because of the stress of living on the streets. 

Another man came up to me asking for $67 for a hotel room tonight for his pregnant girlfriend. They had already received multiple camping tickets and are worried about mounting fines and jail time.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

It was cooked from scratch because that was how people stayed functional — physically and mentally.

Modern American food is different. Sugar is added in massive amounts to cover declining ingredient quality. Processing strips food down, then flavors and sweeteners are added back to make it tolerable. What we call “food” today would have been unrecognizable even a century ago.

The effects aren’t subtle.

Blood sugar spikes, crashes, fatigue, anxiety, and brain fog are treated as personal failures instead of physiological consequences of diet. We talk about mental health as if it exists separately from the body, even though the brain is an organ that runs on chemistry.

I didn’t come to this through theory. After medical issues, I found myself getting sick from processed food, sugar, and dairy. What used to feel normal started making me mentally foggy and physically unstable. I changed my diet to function, not to be virtuous — and over time, it worked.

Cooking from scratch isn’t nostalgia. It’s control.

When you cook with whole ingredients, you relearn cause and effect:

	•	how fat, salt, and heat affect digestion

	•	why some foods calm you and others agitate you

	•	how stable energy feels when blood sugar isn’t spiking

This used to be common knowledge. Now it has to be relearned.

Even coffee shows the problem. Freshly roasted beans go stale in days, not months, yet most people drink old coffee masked with sugar and dairy to hide bitterness. The issue isn’t “coffee intolerance.” It’s degraded inputs.

Diet and mental health aren’t separate systems. When glucose regulation, inflammation, and gut signaling are unstable, mental health follows. That doesn’t mean food cures everything — but ignoring it means ignoring one of the biggest levers we have.

This isn’t about purity or restriction. Modern life is modern life.

It’s about awareness.

We didn’t evolve eating this way.

We didn’t feel this way.

Backstory (aka: how this friend group happened)  
  
Names have been changed.  
  
I (F25) and my best friend Petar (M23) met Marko (M23), Igor (M22), and Mila (F23) about 7–8 months ago, and somehow we turned into an inseparable little chaos unit.  
Petar and I already knew Igor and Mila from the gym, nothing deep, just friendly nods, short chats between sets, that kind of thing. Mila caught Petar’s eye, and he asked me to get to know her better and maybe help set something up.  
Igor and Mila had already been best friends for years, just like Petar and I. A few coffees later, the four of us started hanging out regularly. Then one day, Igor brought along Marko his childhood friend and from that moment on, boom: full friend group unlocked.  
Petar and I have always been loners. Friend groups were kind of a foreign concept for us. Even though we both have other friends and childhood connections, we were always each other’s main support system. So this group felt like a really beautiful, unexpected change and we were honestly so happy.  
A few months ago, Marko and I started dating. Igor and Petar became so close they might as well be twins, and Marko joined them to form a very loud, very chaotic trio. Mila fit in too. I genuinely thought I had finally found a female friend who was kind, open-minded, and comfortable with male–female friendships (which, apparently, many people think are a myth).  
  
At first, everything was great.Then… slowly… cracks started showing.  
We bonded fast. We were all outsiders in our own ways, and together we were basically a group of lovable weirdos.  
  
About me (important context)  
  
I’ve never felt fully comfortable around women. I don’t like being touched by them (better now), and I struggle to trust women as friends. I’m actively working on this with a psychologist.  
Growing up, my mother has BPD, hates physical touch, and has many mental health issues. She believes emotions and affection are bad. There was no warmth, no softness. The only physical contact I had with her was when she hit me or tried to.  
My father and sisters gave me the love and safety I needed, and therapy helped me process a lot of this later.  
I have a twin sister, an older sister, and one female best friend of 10 years. They are the only women I fully trust. Opening up to other women is very difficult for me.  
I love being a woman, truly. But I’ve always felt safer around men, and I worked really hard to even get to a place where I feel somewhat comfortable around women at all.  
  
Me vs. Mila (oil and water, but polite about it… at first)  
  
In many ways, Mila and I are complete opposites.  
I’m more traditionally feminine. I love makeup, styling my hair, dressing up, wearing tighter clothes, think Y2K romantic, soft-girl aesthetic. That’s when I feel most myself.  
Mila is the opposite. She doesn’t like makeup, hates anything on her lips, maybe tolerates mascara and concealer. Hair usually in a messy bun. Hoodies, sweatpants, comfort above all and honestly? It suits her. She looks cute and confident that way.  
She’s worn dresses a few times, but comfort always comes first. Meanwhile, I’ll admit I sometimes go overboard, but dressing up is how I feel comfortable.  
I’m also very affectionate. I love hugs, touch, giving gifts, and words of affirmation - that’s my love language. When I care about someone, I really care. People often call me the “group mom” or the “group therapist.”  
I’m not embarrassed to talk about women’s topics around men. Nothing is taboo for me. Mila, on the other hand, is very emotionally closed off. Her words, not mine: “It’s horrible to be a woman.”  
She once told me she thinks women are weak because they’re too emotional. Personally? I think that’s nonsense.  
Another difference: I’ve had a few relationships. Mila is a virgin. Weird detail, I know, but relevant, some topics clearly make her uncomfortable, especially when I’m more open about them (you know what I mean) .  
When the comments started piling up  
Over time, Mila began making little comments:  
“How can you wear that?”  
“Doesn’t that annoy you?”  
“I could never put that on my lips, that’s disgusting” (it was lip oil, by the way).  
I never snapped back. I never tried to convince her my way was better. I never judged her style.But slowly, it started getting to me so much that I dressed up less, just to avoid standing out.  
The guys always defended me. They told me to do whatever I wanted. They even tried on my heels as a joke, lent me their sneakers when my feet hurt, and Igor always carried an extra hoodie for me because he knew I wanted to look nice and stay warm.  
They support me emotionally too. They hug me when I ask, hold my hand when I’m anxious.  
I have displaced vertebrae in my neck, balance issues, nerve pain, and chronic discomfort. They help me physically all the time, holding my hands on stairs, helping me down from heights, adjusting weights at the gym, watching out for me on bad pain days or when I’m on strong medication. All of them do this.Marko is my boyfriend, and no — he isn’t jealous. He’s a physical therapist. He understands my condition better than anyone and trusts them completely.  
Mila started making jokes like:  
“Won’t Marko get jealous?”  
“What would he say if he saw this?”  
For the record: I don’t sit on anyone’s lap. I don’t flirt.  
The weirdest thing I do is warm my hands under Igor’s arms — the man is a human radiator. Everyone does it. He is our heater.If anything, Marko spends more time sitting on their laps.Mila always framed these comments as jokes. But they stopped being funny.  
  
The breaking point  
Today, we were having coffee — me, Mila, Igor, and Petar — at our usual café.The guys often joke that they want me to have a kid so they can be “uncles” and finally have a group baby. I don’t want kids right now, neither does Marko, but it’s an ongoing joke — how I’d have the coolest kid because of them.  
The topic shifted to parenting. I asked what kind of mother they thought I’d be.  
Before anyone else could answer, Mila said:  
“Well, I don’t know what kind of mother you would be to a female child, you have questionable standards.”  
My jaw hit the floor.  
I asked her to repeat herself. She didn’t. Igor immediately tried to smooth it over, saying she probably meant that I’m more relaxed around men and phrased it badly.  
I stood up, calmly asked Petar to take me home, and left.  
Mila apologized, but I said everything was fine and that we’d talk later. I just needed to go home.  
I talked to Marko. He’s furious. I’m furious too. Mostly at Mila.What does she think of me? Because right now, it feels like she indirectly called me a s..t.  
And the worst part? I study at a Faculty of Education. I’m training to be a kindergarten teacher. I work privately with children, including two kids with learning difficulties. I’m also a swimming instructor for children who are afraid of water.  
So this hit deep. Salt straight into the wound. I don’t want to burn bridges - but I do want to stand up for myself.  
I’ll probably send a message to the group once I calm down. I’ll post it in the comments if anyone’s interested. But I really need advice on how to handle this.  
I’m not looking to start drama, attack anyone, or break up the group. I don’t want to minimize what was said either. I simply want advice on how to address this clearly, calmly, and respectfully in person, while still standing up for myself and setting boundaries.  
Thank you so much for reading and for any advice.

One of my female friend’s common friends asked me out. We didn’t really know each other well—we had only met two or three times, and that too only when my friend was present. Still, he seemed like a decent guy, so when he asked me out on a date, I agreed.

I didn’t want to go empty-handed, so I took a small bouquet for him. I wasn’t expecting a bouquet in return, but I did expect at least something. He didn’t bring anything for me, which felt a little disappointing.

I live in Mumbai, and we decided to meet at a railway station. From there, we planned to travel by train to a nice café. At the station, he asked me whether we should buy train tickets or not. I was honestly shocked—this was a date, and he was suggesting travelling without tickets. I immediately said no, and we bought the tickets.

At the café, we ordered coffee and started talking. But instead of having a proper conversation, he kept forcing his opinions on me and barely let me speak. On top of that, he was constantly cussing, which made me uncomfortable.

By evening, around 7 PM, I told him that I needed to leave. It would take me at least an hour to reach home, and my parents would scold me if I got late. Instead of understanding, he kept insisting that I stay longer. I explained myself multiple times, but he completely ignored what I was saying and kept requesting me to stay.

A while ago, I worked at a coffee packaging plant. Honestly, the job was boringly easy. Your only task was to weigh and seal bags of coffee. The pay was much better than most places around, you could wear your headphones all day, and the hours were excellent.

There was a woman with us named Brenda, about 65 years old, who worked part-time from Tuesday to Thursday. We all cut her a lot of slack because of her age. People were always helping her at her station, so she hardly did any work. And for a part-time job, she was making great money.

Anyway, one week, we smashed our production target, so the company treated everyone to tacos on Friday as a thank you.

The following Tuesday, Brenda came to work and heard about the taco party. She was furious. She went straight to the HR office and complained that it was clear discrimination against her, because management knew she didn't work on Fridays and did it on purpose to exclude her.

She told them that if they didn't get tacos for her shift on Thursday, she would quit. Thursday came and went, and no tacos appeared. And she did it. She threw her one-week notice on the manager's desk.

Towards the end of her last week, it seems she realized that no one else would hire her, so she went back to HR and asked to withdraw her resignation. HR told her absolutely not, and there was no going back on the decision. The last I heard of her, she had to go live with her sister in another state far away.

Hi everyone, I’m looking for advice regarding a dispute with an Airbnb host.

I recently rented an Airbnb for 3 days. During the stay, the pipes froze and we had no hot water for about 24 hours. We informed the host, who sent a plumber that arrived around 6 p.m. The plumber identified where the pipe was frozen but refused to try thawing it. He said he would come back in 4 hours to cut and replace the pipe. We found this very inconvenient and mainly just wanted hot water to shower, so we carefully used a hair dryer. After about 20 minutes, the pipe thawed. This essentially saved the host from a very expensive plumbing bill.

Later during the stay, when we put logs in the fireplace, we noticed that the fire poker was already broken, but we worked around it. At one point, a small ember popped out near the sofa. The sofa was placed very close to the fireplace, and the ember caused a minor burn on the sofa. We reported this to the host right away, thinking we were doing the right thing. That turned out to be a big mistake.

Before leaving, I thoroughly cleaned the place: ran the dishwasher, made the beds, vacuumed, and left the unit in very good condition.

Now the host is demanding nearly 2 000$. He wants a brand new sofa, claiming the current one is no longer available and that only replacing the cushion is impossible. He is also charging us for the fire poker, which we did not break. He added 45$ in extra cleaning fees for coffee splashes on the wall near the coffee machine (normal, minor splashes that take seconds to wipe). He also claims we damaged the floor with firewood, even though we placed the logs carefully on the plexiglass next to the fireplace.

In the photos he provided, you can clearly see the plexiglass is dirty, and he zoomed in on wood chips to make it look like the floor itself was damaged. There are no timestamps on the photos, and he has provided no invoices or quotes to justify the amounts claimed.

I’ve been using Airbnb for over 10 years, have only positive reviews, and have never damaged a property or left a place in poor condition. Unfortunately, I didn’t take photos upon arrival, and Airbnb is currently siding with the host despite the lack of proof.

I absolutely do not want to pay the 2 000$. What are my options or legal recourses ?",0,1769439891.0,legaladvice,0,0.5,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

For context: I’m building [this saas](https://blogseo.io/?atp=DFBMN6)[ ](https://blogseo.io/?atp=DFBMN6)(automated SEO & content for SaaS founders).

No funding.  
No co-founder.  
No big launch.

Just me, a lot of coffee, and slow compounding.

When I started, I thought growth would come from shipping faster or adding more features. That wasn’t it.

The real shift happened when I stopped treating growth like a one-time event and started treating it like a system.

I’m a technical founder, so instead of doing things manually, I automated as much as possible, especially content. I published consistently, even when traffic was basically zero. Month one felt pointless. Month two was slightly less pointless. Then suddenly organic signups started showing up every day.

One article ended up driving a huge chunk of traffic completely by accident. It wasn’t a keyword I would’ve picked manually. That was the moment it clicked for me: SEO rewards consistency way more than “perfect ideas”.

Another thing that helped a lot was staying close to early users. I answered every message, fixed bugs fast, and asked why people signed up (and why they didn’t). A few of those early users ended up becoming my best promoters.

I’m still very early. This isn’t life-changing money yet. But it’s real, growing, and predictable, which honestly feels better than a one-day spike ever could.

Next goal is $3k MRR.

And honestly? Most of us are TERRIBLE at reading romantic signals. We either miss obvious signs or completely overanalyze friendly behavior. I spent months studying body language experts and relationship psychologists because I kept missing signals myself, and what I found actually changed how I see social interactions.

Here's the thing, our brains are wired to protect us from rejection, so we naturally downplay signs of interest. It's not your fault if you've missed crushes before. Biology literally makes us blind to attraction cues unless they're super obvious. But once you know what to look for? Game changer.

**The Micro-Expression Thing**

Their face lights up when they see you. Like, genuinely lights up. Paul Ekman's research on micro-expressions shows that genuine happiness is nearly impossible to fake, the eyes crinkle, the smile reaches the cheeks. If someone's face does this involuntary thing when you walk into a room, that's your brain recognizing their brain being excited about YOU. 

I started noticing this after reading **""What Every BODY is Saying""** by Joe Navarro (ex-FBI agent who literally interrogated people for a living). This book is INSANELY good at breaking down nonverbal communication. Navarro explains how our limbic system (the primitive brain) controls these micro-reactions we can't consciously fake. The part about ""happy feet"" (when someone's feet bounce or point toward you during conversation) blew my mind. This is the best body language book I've ever read, hands down.

**They Remember Weird Details**

Someone with a crush operates like they're preparing for a quiz about you. They remember you mentioned your favorite coffee order three weeks ago. They ask about that project you casually mentioned. Their brain is literally prioritizing information about you.

Ash (it's a mental health app with relationship coaches) has this great module on attachment and attention. People invest attention in what matters to them. If someone's retaining random facts about your life? Their brain has categorized you as important. 

**The Touch Barrier Gets Tested**

Light touches on your arm during conversation. Playful shoulder bumps. ""Accidental"" hand brushes. Touch is how humans test romantic boundaries without explicitly stating interest. 

**""The Like Switch""** by Jack Schafer breaks this down perfectly (he's another ex-FBI guy, apparently they know ALL the secrets). Schafer explains proxemics, how humans use space and touch to signal interest. The book covers ""friendship formulas"" but it's really about attraction patterns. He explains why someone might manufacture reasons to be near you or create ""necessary"" physical contact. The chapter on isopraxism (when people unconsciously mirror each other's body language) will make you question everything you thought you knew about attraction.

**Their Energy Completely Shifts Around You**

Either they become MORE animated (talking faster, louder, more jokes) or they get slightly nervous (fumbling words, touching their face/hair). Both are signs their nervous system is activated by your presence.

Dr. Helen Fisher's research on brain chemistry and attraction shows that dopamine floods the brain when we're around our crush. This creates either excitement-energy or anxiety-energy depending on personality type. It's biochemistry, not coincidence.

**The ""Planned Spontaneity"" Pattern**

They just ""happen"" to show up where you are. They ""randomly"" thought of you when they saw something. These aren't accidents. Their brain is finding excuses to create connection points.

**The Eye Contact Thing Is REAL**

Not staring (that's creepy). But sustained eye contact that lasts a beat longer than normal social interaction. And they look away when caught, then look back. This pattern of ""gaze holding"" followed by ""gaze breaking"" is textbook attraction behavior.

**The Diary of a CEO podcast** did an incredible episode with Dr. Anna Machin (Oxford anthropologist studying love) where she explains the neuroscience of eye contact and oxytocin release. When two people hold eye contact, both brains release bonding chemicals. If someone keeps initiating this with you? Not random.

**They Get Slightly Jealous**

Their mood shifts when you mention other people you're interested in or spending time with. They might get quieter or suddenly need to leave the conversation. This isn't toxic jealousy, it's that their brain is processing ""threat to potential relationship.""

**Communication Patterns Change**

They text you random things. Send you memes. Find reasons to keep conversations going longer than necessary. Look at response times, someone interested usually replies relatively quickly and asks questions to continue dialogue.

I use Finch (habit tracking app that's actually cute and not annoying) to track my own communication patterns, and it made me realize how much extra effort we put into talking to people we're attracted to. We literally reorganize our schedules and priorities around them.

For anyone wanting to go deeper into understanding attraction psychology and communication patterns, there's this AI-powered learning app called BeFreed that pulls together insights from relationship experts, behavioral research, and books like the ones mentioned above. 

What's useful about it is you can set a specific learning goal, like ""understand attraction signals better"" or ""improve my emotional intelligence in dating,"" and it creates a structured learning plan tailored to your situation. It draws from thousands of sources including psychology research, expert interviews, and real-world case studies, then generates personalized audio content you can listen to during your commute.

The depth customization is particularly helpful here. You can start with a quick 10-minute overview of attraction psychology, and if it resonates, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with detailed examples and research breakdowns. Plus you can choose different voice styles (some people prefer the smoky, conversational tone, others like something more straightforward), which makes the learning feel less like studying and more like having an insightful conversation.

**Real talk:** Even with all these signs, the ONLY way to truly know is direct communication. These signals increase probability, but humans are complex and sometimes friendly people just seem flirty. The research just helps you make educated guesses.

But yeah, if someone checks like 5+ of these boxes consistently? Your gut is probably right.",2,1769439344.0,AttractionDynamics,0,1.0,False

The Twin Cities Plaza at 927 Merriam Ave. has recently seen several changes. Messages left with plaza owner Crosspoint Associates of Newton have gone unanswered about future plans. Crosspoint bought the plaza from Geronimo Commercial Properties in 2023 and has started to remake much of the plaza.

The former Uno’s Pizzeria & Grill has been demolished. The Uno’s at The Shops at Blackstone Valley in Millbury has also recently closed, as well as locations in Dedham, Braintree and Revere, reportedly due to underperforming sales numbers but several Massachusetts locations of the famed Chicago deep-dish pizza joint remain open.

Also, the former Workers Credit Union building at the Twin Cities Plaza has been demolished and replaced with a new building, which signs outside say will be a new Starbucks coffee shop. Workers has moved across the street to the former GFA Federal Credit Union location near Five Guys hamburger place.

GFA has said the low usage of the branch location prompted them to close it, referring customers to its other locations in Gardner, Ashburnham, Hubbardston, Rutland, Winchendon or several New Hampshire locations. GFA said it has an agreement with Workers Credit Union, Leominster Credit Union and several other credit unions that will allow GFA customers to continue to do their banking in town, at these other credit unions, through a customer-sharing agreement.

The former Outback Steakhouse in the Twin Cities Plaza has closed, and signs indicate that a new restaurant, Hungry Bowl, will be taking over the location. Another sign there boasts “Mongolian Grill Sushi K-BBQ – All You Can Eat.” A sign on the door says, “We are preparing to open and expect to welcome you in about one month. … Thank you for your patience. We look forward to seeing you soon!”

Also, the former Boston Market rotisserie chicken restaurant in the plaza closed down last year.

Plus, the former longtime favorite Singapore Fine Asian Cuisine & Lounge has been gutted and work is underway to rebuild the building. A Facebook post says “Dear Valued Customers, After 3 wonderful years (though it had been in existence for decades) of serving our community, we are announcing the closing of Singapore in Fitchburg. Our last day of service will be 6/14/25. This decision was not made lightly, and we are deeply grateful for your support, loyalty, and the many memories shared with us over the years. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. With gratitude, The Singapore Fitchburg Team.”

The Facebook announcement prompted 167 comments of people talking about their favorite Singapore memories.

The Singapore closed in May 2020 due largely to the loss in business and worries of workers getting sick from the COVID-19 pandemic, then reopened in July 2020 with the help of $160,000 loan from the Paycheck Protection Program with the Small Business Association that helped address some Board of Health concerns and get the restaurant back on its feet, but also due to a strong community response, with numerous customers voicing their support for its continuation.",3,1769439179.0,LeominsterMass,1,0.71,False

1qni34v,https://i.redd.it/qtatnsxehpfg1.png,"Thiamine: Genomics, Cellular Energy, and Cognitive Function","Thiamine (vitamin B1) is vital for energy production and neurological health. Genetic differences can influence how much thiamine you need, making it important to understand both dietary sources and your personal risk factors.

**Fundamental for cellular energy:**  
Thiamine, in various forms, is an essential cofactor in **mitochondrial energy production**. Thus, a deficiency in this vitamin can cause various symptoms. New research also points to a role for thiamine in neurodegenerative diseases and cataracts.

Thiamine (also spelled thiamin) is vitamin B1. It is *essential,* meaning that the body doesn’t make it and you have to get it from food.

Why is it essential? ATP production, used in every cell for energy, requires thiamine. An insufficient amount of thiamine can cause problems with cellular energy.

**Thiamine deficiency:**  
Severe deficiency of thiamine leads to a disease called beriberi. It is uncommon in our modern era to have beriberi except in cases of chronic alcohol abuse or a rare genetic mutation. However, understanding the symptoms of beriberi explains some of the conditions associated with milder deficiency.

Both severe thiamine deficiency and mild insufficiency can cause a range of neurological and physical symptoms.\[[ref](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1533210110392941)\]\[[ref](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/thiamin#metabolic-diseases-treatment)\]\[[ref](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.1031502/full)\]

# Thiamine absorption and genetics:

Thiamine is absorbed in the upper part of the small intestine. Most dietary thiamine is in a phosphorylated form, which is converted in the intestines to free thiamine before being absorbed. At low doses (below 5 mg), thiamine is absorbed using the thiamine transporters SLC19A2 and SLC19A3.\[[ref](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.1031502/full)\] Thiamine produced by the gut microbiome is absorbed in the colon through the SLC44A4 transporter.\[[ref](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.1031502/full)\] SLC35F3 is an intracellular thiamine transporter, and once inside the cells, SLC25A19 moves thiamine into the mitochondria.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qni00n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qni00n,The Boca Raton Review- A great family getaway or a quick escape from the cold!,"Sharing a quick review from my recent one-night stay at The Boca Raton as I know a lot of folks on this sub are curious about it.

For context, I am a member of Sarah's team, but booked this entirely on my own. I also have family who are members of the club (full access to the resort facilities) and therefore have spent a lot of time on property. Happy to answer any questions!

**TL;DR:** This is a great resort, especially with some recent updates and renovations. If you can avoid peak holiday weeks or just need a quick couple's getaway, it is a great option in South Florida with impressive on-site dining and activities (for kids and adults).

**Property:** The resort is actually made up of five different hotels that to some degree operate independently. They are: The Cloister, The Yacht Club, The Tower, The Beach club, and the Bungalows. That totals about 900 rooms, which is why I'd say to try your best to avoid peak school breaks. Generally, I'd skip The Cloister as the rooms need a renovation. The Yacht Club is adults only, but you'd still use most of the resort facilities, so expect to see kids and only book this if you really care about having a private wing without kids. The Tower and The Beach Club were both recently renovated and are beautiful. Modern, beach-resort vibes, with great touches and a ton of room configurations. The bungalows are typically for long-term stays and are two-bed suites that can be great if you need things like a kitchenette.

The first three hotels listed above are all interconnected by the main building. The Beach Club is across a small waterway where they have two water taxis constantly running (great for kids) and takes about 5 minutes, in addition to typical shuttle busses. The Bungalows are a bit of a hike in another part of the property behind the golf course and some unaffiliated residences, but can be accessed by shuttle or on-demand Mokes (the walk is probably just over ten minutes).

Michael Dell's investment firm came in around 2019 and purchased the property and has since put $250M+ into renovations. The main resort has a really unique Spanish style architecture with stone buildings and some exposed wooden beams in high-ceiling areas. They've done a great job keeping some Floridian character, without it being too over the top and preppy like some Palm Beach hotels.

**Food and Beverage:** They advertise having 19 dining outlets on property. As part of the purchase, Major Food Group led by Mario Carbone, came in and started refreshing the program. He brought Sadelle's (main breakfast), Principessa (Italian), and Flamingo Grill (steakhouse, and my personal favorite). These all give a classic New York vibe in South Florida, just with a little more space and easier reservations. The other main dining establishments are a nice variety with a mix between elevated and some fine-dining, to casual pool/beach environments, but I'll spare everyone and not list them all here. The remaining portion are more casual spots (macaron shop for kids, a pool bar, burger stands, coffee shop etc.) It's a lot, I know, but I think what's great is that you can stay on property for quite a while and truly not get sick of the food. I've had a meal at almost every location, so if you need recommendations, let me know!

**Room:** For this trip we stayed in The Tower and booked an Estate View Corner Studio, and were upgraded to an Ocean View Corner Studio which was stunning. The refreshed rooms have light oak floors, a large couch with a lake view, and double sinks. I even appreciated the small (maybe six inches wide) floor to ceiling windows behind each nightstand letting a view of the water in. At check-in we were offered water or a sprtiz which was nice and all drinks/snacks in the room were complimentary. The team also did an incredible job with welcome amenities including our favorite drinks and bites and some fresh clementines.

As an FYI, there is a club level in the tower that is on the top floor and is absolutely beautiful. Breakfast is served up there for suite guests and there are sitting areas for reading/working. There is also a lounge on the second-floor, but this is just really a few tables, coffee/pastries etc. One cool thing I did notice was they had a partnership with Master & Dynamic headphones that you could take out and utilize for a listening experience.

Overall, I'd vote for staying at either the Tower or the Beach club, depending on if you want beach access, and then consider the Yacht club if you wanted true adults-only with some other exclusive perks.

**Activities:** I think this is where the resort really shines. For kids you have a lazy river, waterslides, flowrider (surfing), a kids club, a brand-new decked out arcade, and other game rooms. I've had friends who have said the kids activities really beat anywhere else they've stayed in the US.

For adults, there's golf, tennis, awesome pickleball courts (with a bar), boat rentals, two gyms with classes, bike rentals, and a Ferrari driving experience and house cars (new Lexus SUVs) to bop around town, if needed. We spent the day at the adults pool and had great service all-around.

**Spa:** While I didn't go this stay, my wife did, and I have been previously. This time she got a quick ritual bath. The spa is inspired by the Alhambra Palace and has beautiful intricate touches throughout. In order to access, you either need a day pass or a treatment (unless you're staying at the yacht club). In addition to 40+ treatment rooms, there's an indoor lounge, a spa pool, and a spa cafe. Highly recommend checking it out, especially if you want an escape from the busier portions of the resort.

**Service:** I think this has come a long way, but I've also seen quite a few snafus and why I'd suggest avoiding peak school breaks, if possible. Everyone is great and they are fully-staffed, especially in the winter time. However, the resort is also a members club and over the holidays when the hotel is packed and members have families in town, food service can be really slow. I also think that sometimes the five hotels can be a little confusing. My wife and I split to go check out, and she went to the cloister desk even though we were in the tower. The desk agent was adamant she couldn't help resolve our comped breakfast and that we had to handle it with the Tower (it was gone by the time it came through the folio, but it would've been nice just to call and get it sorted).

**Final Thoughts:** I think the resort has truly stepped into a new era with the investments and renovations and feels more modern than some of its competitors. It is a great, easily-accessible destination from the majority of the US (can fly into either FLL or PBI, or privately into Boca). For a lot of families, I think this can be a great alternative to something like The Breakers that has amenities for everyone. For couples, it is a perfect long weekend warm-weather getaway without having to worry too much about travel logistics and get some great food, relaxation, and much-needed sun this time of year.

FYI this year, as it is their 100th anniversary, they are running an offer for a $100 nightly resort credit. Add this to comped breakfast, and you're basically only having to pay for dinner on property!",7,1769438885.0,FATTravel,5,0.9,False

1qnhzeb,https://v.redd.it/glg66gy7gpfg1,Survival (Endless) Pool Setup,"Plants that I play with in this setup:

-Pumpkin

-Pumpkin (via Imitater)

Ice-shroom (If there is no Zombie Bungee, you can also use it; otherwise, it is essential.)

-Cherry Bomb

-Puff-shroom

-Blover

-Coffee Bean


The following plants are useful in case there are Jack-in-the-Box Zombies:

-Fume-shroom

-Gloom-shroom


Pro Tip:
When you see the text “A huge wave of zombies is approaching” (the last wave), activate an Ice-shroom exactly 5 seconds after that text appears. This will freeze all zombies and block zombie spawning in the pool.


SETUP:

If you have problems placing the stairs, I recommend watching some videos on YouTube—they are very helpful.

Best way to set the stairs:
(In Replanted, you can exit and re-enter the game until the Ladder Zombie appears. This can be done after the first two flags.)

For context:

My husband has a friend, let's call him Angel (pero demonyo talaga ugali). friend nya to since his teenage years. sya pa naging bestman nung kasal namin. may wife na din si angel and all goods naman kami as in okay kami sa lahat ng bagay. nag hhang out kami from time to time. pag may bday nagkikita kami, or nag ddinner and coffee pag nagkakayayaan. so okay kami as in. 

but etong si Angel maraming kalokohan. nagbbook ng kung sino sinong babae na walang ka alam alam wife nya.. btw, wala pa sila kids so hindi ko alam kung factor ba yun kaya nakakapagloko pa sya pero mukhang di na nya yun matanggal sa sistema nya 🙄 hindi pa sila kasal ng wife nya may mga ganyan na syang kalokohan. akala namin magbabago nung kinasal. pero hindi pa rin pala. 

Friend ko na din naman yung wife nya and naawa ako. Alam ko lahat ng trip nyan ni Angel kasi knukwento sakin ng husband ko. pero di alam ni Angel na may alam ko. kala nya sila lang tatlong magkakaibigan lang nakakaalam ng kalokohan nya. my husband is very open naman sakin pagdating sa mga ganyang bagay, minsan nakikinig lang ako, minsan sinasabihan ko na wag nila

itolerate dahil kawawa yung wife. ganun naman nga daw sinasabi nila pero syempre alam nyo na pag usapang lalake minsan sinasakyan nalang din nila. so dahil ayaw naman namin makealam sa buhay nilang mag asawa we kept mum abt it.

So eto ang kwento. I am 8months pregnant now and etong si Angel ay may kalokohan na naman at panay ang send sa gc nila ng kung ano ano, (yes nababasa ko). nag ssend sya ganap nila ng mga babaeng binubook nya na parang niyayabang pa nya sa gc nila. and worst, inaaya nya pa si husband na magbook ng babae or kung ano man bago man lang daw ako manganak. talked to my husband abt it sinabi kong hindi ako comfortable. he promised me na he wont do anything stupid at may tiwala ako sa husband ko. Ang naiinis ako dun sa Angel! Why would he do such thing? na ayain pa sa ganun yung husband ko. knowing na kaibigan nya naman ako at buntis ako? wala man lang sya respeto sakin as wife ng kaibigan nya. 

Isang araw pinalampas ko, pero 2 or 3 days na nangungulit pa rin sya sa asawa ko. Tho nakkita ko naman sa mga msgs nila na hindi nya ineentertain mga sinasabi nung Angel. My husband assured me naman na kakausapin daw nya. Pero nanggigil talaga ako sa Angel na demonyo na yan. kadiri talaga. I have all the receipts and screenshots ng mga pinag ssend nyang kalokohan nya. and pumapasok talaga sa isip ko na kausapin sya to warn him na kung hindi sya titigil makakarating talaga sa asawa nya lahat. 

So ayun, tama ba na imsg ko si Angel? or just let my husband settle things with him? kalmado pa ako now kesa nung mga nakaraang araw. ngayon na ttrigger lang talaga kasi nga hindi pa din sya tumitigil kaka kulit sa husband ko and sobrang nakakabastos on my part.  I would really appreciate your advice guys. pagpasensyahan nyo na ang emotions and hormones ng buntis 😥✌🏻",6,1769438824.0,nanayconfessions,18,0.8,False

The city is affordable, public transport is simple, cafes are everywhere and settling into a daily routine didn’t take long. From a practical standpoint it’s been one of the smoother places I’ve worked remotely.  
  
What caught me off guard was the loneliness. The days are full work, walks along the Danube, grocery runs, finding a favorite coffee spot but the evenings can feel surprisingly quiet. I didn’t expect to miss casual, unplanned interactions as much as I do. It’s not that Budapest feels unwelcoming more that building connection as a solo remote worker takes more effort than I anticipated.

My time is already requested off for the end of June!!

My original plan was Lake Bled, Slovenia and exploring that area, but then some people told me to Croatia too! I was pretty set on Pula, I was going to split the two up! After more research I’m reading Croatia is expensive, and that Greece is half the cost.

That’s when I started looking more into Greece and I thought Crete looked amazing! I’ve honestly read nothing but great things about it, so I was pretty set on that next, but I’ve always always always wanted to go to Bali, so I started looking more into that.

I decided in Bali, I booked an Airbnb in Ubud, and I was super excited, but ended up down a rabbit hole about Bali also being expensive, then found expectations vs reality posts and pictures and videos, and apparently Bali for Australians is Cancun for us Americans!!

I really want this trip to be unforgettable, I’m so excited I get to do this, it’s my once in a lifetime bucket list dream to travel, so I’d love to hear if my research it accurate, is Croatia to expensive, will I get bored in a Greece island for 12 days, and is Bali really expensive, overcrowded, and dirty?!

Thank you!

I love history and enrichment, I want to explore and see beautiful old buildings and monuments, but I also want to relax and slow down and enjoy sitting and sipping coffee, and eat amazing food!

​We all know the **Sunk Cost Fallacy** or **Confirmation Bias**, but in the heat of a decision, we rarely spot them in our own thinking. I wanted a way to ""audit"" my logic before sending a high-stakes email or committing to a project.

​So I built **BiasCheck**. It’s a lightweight web app designed for one thing: catching mental blind spots in your writing.

​**How it works:**

You paste a specific argument or a thought process, and the AI cross-references it against a library of **120+ scientific biases**. It doesn't give you ""advice""—it just shows you the ""bugs"" in your logic.

​**Why I made it a Web App:**

* ​**Privacy First:** Your data belongs to you.
* ​**Zero Friction:** No App Store bloat. It works instantly in your mobile or desktop browser.
* ​**Focus:** It’s optimized for deep analysis of short, critical texts rather than scanning whole documents.

​**The Goal:**

To help people make more objective decisions by making the ""invisible"" visible.

​The first three scan are free so you can test the accuracy. If you find it valuable, the Pro version (unlimited scans) is about the price of a coffee.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

When families visit your city, do you ever see (or experience) genuine connections forming — not tours or organized activities, but everyday interactions? Kids playing together, a shared coffee, a normal afternoon that isn’t “tourism” as such.

Or does that mostly *not* happen?

As locals, it often feels like visitors want something “authentic,” but daily life is already full — work, school, routines, social circles. I’m wondering where the gap actually is, and whether those kinds of connections are realistic or mostly a nice idea from the outside.

I find these women on dating apps. Today there are so many. I never use the same one twice. I give fake names: John, Jacob. Easy to remember, easy to forget.

I always pick women who are a 4-6 on the attractiveness scale. Not that it’s an exact science. I have found they are the easiest to manipulate.

Today, I am meeting Opal. We bonded over our shared love of fantasy romance novels (not that I’ve ever read any). If you want to win someone’s trust, simply mirror them. My goal is to project charming, cute, and, most of all, harmless. Weak, you could say.

When I pick Opal up, I am sure to get out of my car and open the door for her. A pointless gesture that women seem to swoon over. It disarms them.

“Ooh, a gentleman,” Opal says. She might be being sarcastic. I can’t exactly tell, I’m bad at reading people.

It is five past eleven when we pull into The Cattitude Cafe’s parking lot. Mornings are best. Mornings are safe. Nobody expects a terrible crime to happen before noon.

The cat cafe is also part of my disguise. A date at a cat cafe? *Oh what a sweet, charming young man!*

Little do they know this is part of my ritual.

The cats decide.

You see, if I simply gave in to my baser desires, I would go on a killing rampage. A shooting at a mall, or a university would be such ecstasy. The thrill of a lifetime and over in a heartbeat.

We must always strive to be better than our baser selves.

So I’ve added this element to my ritual: fate.

If a single cat is friendly to my date, if a single cat sits in their lap, or purrs around their ankles, they get to live. I will ghost them, and they will never know how close they were to death.

I have been on twenty two dates so far. And three women were unable to get a single cat to show them affection. Jessica, Maria, and Eloise. Just saying their names makes me salivate.

I hold the door open for Opal, and she walks in like she owns the place. She is stunningly confident, and her lavender hair dye makes my stomach turn.

I ask her what she wants to order, and she says, “Surprise me.”

I go and order two coffees, cream and sugar, and two cat paw brownies with the pink toe bean frosting. How miserable. The clerk smiles, and goes into the back to make our order.

When I turn to Opal, she is sitting at a table. In front of her, every cat in the cafe is sitting on their hind legs like children lined up for story time. There are more than I remember. Forty cats maybe. A large orange cat with long thick fur gracefully leaps into her lap.

Opal leans in, and the orange cat sticks their snout near her ear, as if whispering to her.

“Three?” she says to the cats. The cat in her lap is mewing something into her ear, I can see it’s little mouth moving. “Jessica? Maria? Eloise?”

When I hear their names, I freeze.

Opal turns her eyes to me, and all the cats slowly turn their predator eyes on me.

Everything is wrong, and I realize that I am the prey in this trap.

I panic. I bolt for the door, but nearly there, I trip over something furry.

I hear my head hit something, feel a sort of pressure, but don’t feel any pain. Actually, I don’t feel anything. Anything at all. And I can’t move.

I am on my back, looking up at the door I nearly made it to. Opal comes into my view, and I see her flip the open sign to closed.

She looks down at me, then to the cats and says, “Who’s hungry?”

Inspired by some other posts I give you: my version of 75386 + 75373 + some leftover parts from other MOC. 

The “hinge” part comes with the sets - just the rocky floor of the cave needs to be aligned with the base entrance (to fit nicely after folding). No design. Just spontaneous creative frenzy during morning coffee.

1qnhu37,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedIn_AI/comments/1qnhu37/my_coworker_thought_she_was_playing_5d_chess_to/,My coworker thought she was playing 5D chess to get our manager fired. It backfired on her spectacularly.,"A new hire (we'll call her Nancy) and I started in the same month, joining a team of four under a Director.

The first time we all sat down together, Gina - the most senior person on the team - immediately started warning us about our manager and what a nightmare he was. She told us we had to be careful and went on a long rant about how incompetent and micromanaging he was. She was very dramatic about it, making it seem like we had made the mistake of our lives by accepting this job.

Nancy and I looked at each other, both thinking: 'Great, what kind of mess have we gotten ourselves into?'

About a week later, we discovered that Gina barely worked at all. Our work hours are flexible (from 8-11 AM to 4-7 PM). She would come in at 8 AM, mess around for two hours, and then go on a long coffee run as soon as our manager arrived at 10 AM. She wouldn't return until 1:30 PM, just as we were finishing lunch. Then she might do two hours of actual work before leaving at 4 PM on the dot. Our manager could be moody and sometimes difficult, but he wasn't bad. Honestly, we were pretty impressed with how well she knew how to play the system.

We have about 5 big projects we work on each year, and Gina always timed her vacations to coincide with them perfectly.

Then came the quarterly reviews, and Gina went ballistic. She got a 2 (out of 5) in everything, and her bonus was practically zero.

She made a huge scene, went straight to the VP of HR, and complained to anyone who would listen about the great injustice done to her.

She started telling everyone she was looking for a new job and that she was done with this place. Her work productivity dropped from very little to literally zero. She was only coming to the company to collect a paycheck.

A few months later, the first big project of the season was approaching. And as usual, right on schedule, she submitted her vacation request. This time, our manager denied it.

And of course, this caused another problem. Gina said her flights and hotels were already booked and non-refundable, and that her husband's vacation had already been approved. So she went back to the VP of HR again.

Somehow, she won. HR approved her vacation, and when she came back, she was very smug. She told us that HR had promised her a new manager and was happily hinting that our Director would be fired soon.

But that's not what happened. Instead, HR announced that our group would be reorganized and split into two teams, and they were looking to move a few people to the new team.

Around the same time, another colleague was unfortunately let go.

Gina saw this as her chance to make a power move. She volunteered to move to the new team, fully convinced that our manager would beg her to stay. Without her, it would just be me and Nancy, the two least experienced members. She thought there was no way he would let his team shrink to just the two of us.

Except he called her bluff and approved her transfer request immediately. And HR sent her the confirmation email.

And of course, another tantrum ensued. Our department was originally 'Marketing and Communications.' Now they were splitting. Gina had built her entire reputation on Communications and claimed that Marketing was a completely different world (it's really not). She was screaming that HR was ruining her career. She completely forgot that she was the one who had requested the transfer in the first place.

She ran down to HR again, but this time they were fed up with her drama. She came back to our desks crying, and we tried to be nice, but honestly, we had deadlines to meet.

In the end, she went to the Marketing team with a new director, and this guy had no interest in her long coffee breaks. He arrived at the office just as early as she did, and to her complete shock, he would leave her a list of tasks to do every morning.",32,1769438506.0,LockedIn_AI,2,0.89,False

When families visit your city, do you ever see (or experience) genuine connections forming — not tours or organized activities, but everyday interactions? Kids playing together, a shared coffee, a normal afternoon that isn’t “tourism” as such.

Or does that mostly *not* happen?

As locals, it often feels like visitors want something “authentic,” but daily life is already full — work, school, routines, social circles. I’m wondering where the gap actually is, and whether those kinds of connections are realistic or mostly a nice idea from the outside.

Not criticizing tourism at all — just interested in how this looks from the local side.

Would love to hear honest perspectives, including why it *doesn’t* happen.",0,1769438488.0,LondonTravel,8,0.38,False

1qnhtem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/1qnhtem/resume_mistakes_that_can_prevent_you_from_getting/,Resume mistakes that can prevent you from getting a job,"I’ve been thinking about this more than I probably should. Mostly late at night, after a long shift, when my brain refuses to shut up and starts replaying old emails and unanswered applications. I’m in my mid-30s, worked in healthcare most of my adult life. You send out a resume, wait, hear nothing. Or you get a polite rejection that doesn’t really say anything. And at some point you start wondering if it’s you… or the way you’re presenting yourself on paper.

At some point I compared my resume to how I’d explain my job to another physician over coffee. And they didn’t sound anything alike. One sounded human. The other sounded like HR wrote it after skimming my badge.

What bothered me wasn’t that I lacked experience. On paper, I looked solid. Years in clinical settings, certifications, responsibilities that actually mattered. And eventually a recruiter said something that stuck with me in a slightly uncomfortable way. Mine read like it could belong to any competent clinician in my specialty. And that was the problem. It was technically correct, clean, professional… and completely interchangeable.

Looking back, the biggest mistake wasn’t formatting or missing keywords. It was hiding behind generic language. I listed duties like everyone does because that’s what we’re trained to do. “Provided patient care.” “Collaborated with multidisciplinary teams.” All true. 

Another thing I underestimated was how much we downplay ourselves. We’re taught not to brag. Not to center ourselves. Not to say “I did this” too loudly. That mindset leaks into resumes. So instead of showing impact, decisions, moments where things went sideways and you handled it, you end up with this flat list of tasks. Clean. Professional. Dead.

I also made the mistake of trying to sound impressive instead of real. Big words, vague phrases, zero texture. No sense of who I actually am at work. 

I rewrote it slowly. Not in one heroic session. More like trimming things that felt fake. Adding specifics that felt slightly uncomfortable to say out loud. Keeping it imperfect on purpose. The irony is that once it sounded more like me, it stopped feeling risky.

I even caught myself thinking, “This feels almost too personal.” Which probably meant it was finally honest.

I still don’t think there’s one perfect formula. I don’t think everyone needs the same kind of resume.
