The end of the rug is a walkway down the hall. I centered the tv stand with the rug/where the couch will be. There isn’t much room on the empty side of the tv stand. 

My questions:

1) Would these curtains look crazy over the door? I feel like they’d add another texture. Everything seems “flat.” All my friends disagree lol. 

2) Should I add lighting to the paintings? Like a picture light above each? 

3) Any lighting suggestions? It’s not a huge space. I was thinking a lamp in the corner on a coffee table?

***EDITED TO ADD:*** [Select photos from our wedding! Credit to Katrina Amante.](https://imgur.com/a/HTkmPHa)



**LOCATION**: Millwick, DTLA

**DATE**: June 8, 2024

**GUESTS**: 123 Invited, 94 RSVP’d ‘Yes,’ 92 Attended, including us (2 last minute no-shows for illness)

**WEDDING DAY COST**: $62,969 + tips

Full disclosure! My parents gifted us $50k to spend on the wedding as we pleased, and we made up the difference. Please note that this does not include the rehearsal dinner my FIL hosted at Hotel Per La on the Thursday night, or the beach welcome party my MIL threw the day before the wedding! I’d roughly estimate that these additional events cost about $20k combined total.

**NOTES**

From the start, my husband and I were committed to a wedding that felt totally ‘like us’ - we wanted it to feel personal, intimate, unstuffy, and filled with unique touchpoints to share with our special guests from the moment they received their invitations in the mail to their final moments at the venue.

Our biggest priorities going into the planning process were food (we met in NYC while I was a cook at a 2 Michelin star restaurant, and he was the lead engineer at a vertical farm growing herbs for chefs across the city) and music (I now work in the music industry!). Our planning was experience-led, but with a strong sense of design and decor in mind.

Below is all 2024 pricing, so your mileage may vary! I will share vendors below, we had an absolutely star studded team who worked with us tirelessly to create a personal and seamless event and I cannot recommend them all enough.

**Venue**: **$14,850 (**[**Millwick**](https://marvimon.com/millwick/) **| Marvimon Productions)**

After having toured many different locations, we knew Millwick was the right choice from the moment we stepped in. The space really suited our vision, with one large indoor/outdoor space that allowed our guests to mix and mingle, a huge projector screen (we LOVED this!), a quirky urban vibe that matches our personalities and story, and most importantly the flexibility to work with any vendors of our choosing.

Their team is well seasoned and had helpful documents and leads for every question we had. This was particularly of use to us, as we did the design and planning for the event by ourselves until the month of the wedding.

Booking at Millwick included an in-person meeting, 12 hour rental (we booked from 1pm to 1am), tables, chairs, site management, and security staff.

**Month-Of Coordination**: $**2,650 (**[**Pop the Champagne**](https://popthechampagneevents.com/)**)**

We discovered Pop the Champagne through Millwick’s recommended vendors list - we actually ended up booking a number of the vendors on Millwick’s list, after having found their services on our own and cross referencing with their recommendations. We wanted to prioritize putting together a team that was familiar with the venue and space, with bonus points if our vendors had worked with each other before. We ended up assembling a team who had all worked together before, which I think made a huge difference in the night running extremely smoothly. We had ZERO hiccups, and all went without a hitch.

We started working with our coordinator Taylor about 6 weeks before our date, and she did an amazing job seamlessly taking everything off our hands and executing our wedding to perfection. She brought the absolute best vibes, even though she was already 8 months pregnant!!! Ours was her penultimate wedding before maternity leave, and she really went above and beyond to make us feel taken care of.

**Catering: $19,218 (Fundamental Events) + $400 (Porto’s Bakery)**

This was pretty much our most important vendor - food was really our priority, and we were eager to find a team who would be willing to work with us to create a FULLY CUSTOM menu! Fundamental really blew it out of the water for us. I was upfront from the very beginning about our background and how important the food was to us, and they totally met that energy and even superseded it.

My husband and I wrote out a menu filled with dishes we often make for each other and for gatherings, and our mains were the dishes we each first made for each other (the one I first made for him, and the one he first made for me!).

The chefs at Fundamental seemed to really have fun with it, because they ended up finding smart and cool ways to elevate all our ideas to feel more upscale. Everyone absolutely RAVED about the food! Six months out we’re still hearing from friends about how much they dream about the food at our wedding haha.

Everything was served family style, with super generous portions - those plates and bowls were HEAVY.

* **Stationary Appetizers and Passed Hors D’Œuvres**
   * Cheese, charcuterie and fruit station
   * Mezze, farmer’s market crudités and assorted dips station
   * Heirloom tomato toast with furikake, radish and yuzu kosho aioli
   * Pear & brie phyllo spring roll with maple reduction
   * Deviled ramen quail egg on a wonton crisp
   * BBQ pork baos with pickled onion
* **Dinner**
   * Cornbread madeleines with whipped honey butter
   * Arugula and endive salad with citrus, avocado and lemon herb vinaigrette
   * Fettuccine romesco with burrata, roasted red peppers and basil oil (the first dish I made for my husband)
   * Lemongrass ginger chicken thighs with baby boo chow, sweet peppers and garlic fried rice (the first dish my husband made for me)
   * Grilled asparagus with pickled fresno peppers, Thai basil, mint and chili crisp
   * Hot honey roasted brussels sprouts with caramelized shallots and preserved lemon
* **Dessert** 
   * I grew up going to Porto’s Bakery with my extended family and LOVE their cakes! We went with a tiered cake with strawberry and mascarpone, and supplemented with their carrot cake (my husband’s fave) and the tres leches (my fave).
   * The tiered cake was gorgeous, and I’m really happy we went with the supplemental cakes to go along. Porto’s has amazing cakes, so these went quickly despite there being more cake than we were recommended for our guest count! The cake was truly delicious.
   * Fundamental sent us home with a slice of each cake, which we were grateful for when we finally got back to our hotel room around 3 am!

**Alcohol: \~$2,000 (Total Wine)**

Fundamental bartended our event and brought in all mixers, soft drinks and garnishes - we were on the hook for the alcohol, and any other drinks we wanted to provide.

I can’t for the life of me find the final alcohol order, but we spent around $2k total between red and white wine, Prosecco, seltzers (we opted against beer knowing our crowd), and spirits for our signature cocktails.

We ran with a pared down open bar - 2 welcome beverages, unlimited wine, seltzers, 3 signature cocktails and assorted non-alcoholic drinks. We wanted some fun non-alcoholic options (mint lemonade, Sanzo seltzers), which we paid for ourselves.

We made a fun event of choosing the red and white wine options with our friends! Months before the wedding we hosted a ‘wine party’ with dinner where we ranked 6 reds and 6 whites to find the ones people loved the most. We ended up serving the crowd favorite red and white at the wedding. Definitely recommend doing this, as it was super fun and helped our friends feel involved with the planning process!

* **Welcome Drinks**
   * Limoncello spritz with Prosecco
   * Mint lemonade
* **Signature Cocktails**
   * “Rising Sun” - Japanese whiskey highball
   * “Hemingway Daiquiri” - Rum, maraschino liqueur, grapefruit and lime
   * “Porco Rosso” Negroni - Gin, Campari, sweet vermouth, orange peel

**Rentals: $0**

We really saved here. We ended up going with the standard selections for all plateware, glassware, napkins, etc. and didn’t opt for any additional seating or tables over what Millwick already had available for use. Millwick came equipped with ample couches and coffee tables, which worked out perfectly for our guest count.

All things considered, while it would have been nice to elevate our place settings with prettier or fancier options, I am beyond happy we saved here and invested elsewhere!

Zero rentals was only made possible working with the specific vendors we worked with - our florist brought their own candles and hurricane vases and their vases were included in the cost, our caterer wrapped rental fees into the cost for services, and our venue came equipped with tables, chairs, couches, etc.

**Flowers**: **$6,250 (Shindig Chic)**

Okay, I AM COMPLETELY obsessed with our florals. I am actually still pinching myself for how stylish, fun, and whimsical she made everything look and feel. Working with Angelena was an absolute dream, and she was on board from the beginning to brainstorm ideas to make it personal and tell our story.

We ended up incorporating a ton of vegetables and fruits into everything from my bouquet, to the tablescapes, etc. It was such a fun nod to our history as a couple, and brought in some really exciting, unexpected textures and colors to the aesthetic of our tables, the aisles, the bar etc. I was adamant from the beginning that I wanted it to feel refreshing and unusual, and she totally, totally pulled it off!! It honestly looked and felt so upscale, I can’t get over how fun and personalized our florals were.

Among the vegetables and fruits on display, we had cherry tomatoes, Napa cabbages, long beans, lychees, grapes, garlic, radishes, bitter melon, kale, Brussels sprouts, and much more.

Our price included lots of taper candles of various colors and textures, my bridal bouquet, my husband’s bout, 4 bridesmaids bouquets, 7 groomsmen bouts, and floral displays at the altar, along the aisle, at the bar and with our guestbook, a huge cornucopia at the bride and groom table, and 18 table centerpieces.

**DJ**: **$2,650 (Dart Collective)**

Other than food, our DJ was the other most important vendor in our minds throughout the planning process. We felt strongly that the DJ is the vibe captain of the event, and we wanted to ensure that the energy levels would be managed by a true pro. 

From the moment we had our first call with Dart Collective we knew they were the right choice. They sent us a detailed music map questionnaire that went into detail about each phase of our wedding day, from guest arrival to the end of the reception. We delivered really specific answers with timestamps for our songs, ‘must hear’ songs, do not plays, playlists with our favorite songs, etc - I’m sure we came off as a bit overeager! However, not only was their team super patient with us, they really overdelivered onsite. We didn’t have a single mishap throughout the event, and in fact they were particularly gracious when one of our guests requested a final song after our DJ was already scheduled to leave… 

**Wedding Photographer: $2,800 (Katrina Amante)**

This is another place where I am just extremely thankful for finding the best vendor in our budget - Katrina brought such genuine energy to her work, and the final product is nothing short of editorial. She did an incredible job of balancing posed shots with candids, resulting in a gallery filled with print-worthy shots that still capture the true essence and feeling of what it was like to be there on the day.

For our price, we received 10 hours with a second shooter, and a gallery of 650 photos. We ended up with well over the promised 650, which was also a very welcome surprise!

**Wedding Videographer: $3,000 (EverTwo Films)**

My husband and I went back and forth over hiring a videographer, but I truly think that of all vendors this ended up being the one that I look back on and feel most thankful that we had. If you’re on the fence about a videographer, I’ll pitch in my two cents and say that I will guard these videos with my entire life - the hard drive they’re on is on my list of things I’ll save in a fire.

We weren’t looking for much more than the raw footage of our ceremony, first dances, speeches, etc, so we went with a very pared down package. That being said, the 6 minute film they edited was really touching and special!

**Stationery + Day-Of: $631 for save the dates and invites plus shipping + $287 for day-of signage (DIY)**

This is another place where we really saved! We 100% could have kept these costs even further down, but we went all out for our invitations. My husband and I are huge fans of Magic: the Gathering, so we created a custom booster pack filled with cards that shared the details of our wedding with our guests, including a Treasure token for our friends who play the game. We loved that we got to share the thrill of opening packs with our guests! The custom booster packs cost approximately $500 - if we had gone with something simpler, we could easily have cut this down. However, I’m extremely happy with how our invites turned out! It was a great ‘first handshake’ for our event, and set the tone with our guests about what they could expect for the wedding.

I designed the day-of signage myself on Procreate and Canva. I work in design and have experience in print, which helped this feel more approachable! We opted against a welcome sign and used the projector at Millwick to display the guest chart (pro tip: this was fantastic for last minute changes!). We ended up printing bar menus, guest book signs, menus, name cards, and custom placemats through UPrinting.

**Attire:** 

* Dress: Watters, $3,150 + $400 alterations
* Veil: My mom’s, $75 cleaning
* Shoes: Manolo Blahnik, $90 secondhand
* Second look dress: Mango, $150
* Wedding bands: $630 each, $1,260 total
* Tuxedo: $200, rental

**Hair & Makeup: $1,458**

* This included my trial, my day-of look, and makeup services for 4 bridesmaids + hair services for 1 bridesman

**Valet: $2,019**

This was the only mandatory vendor for Millwick! 

**Hotel + Getting Ready Space: $800 | Hotel Per La, Downtown Los Angeles**

This is where we booked our hotel block, and had our rehearsal dinner! We loved staying at Hotel Per La - it was super convenient to get to Millwick, and their Olive Suite was perfect to host getting ready on the morning of the wedding. The space is super chic and comfortable, which was the perfect way to host our friends and family traveling in.

**Not included**

* Our wedding favors were gifts from our respective moms! My mom made a flight of 5 macarons themed around love for each guest, and my MIL made custom 12 oz rose and mint soy/coconut candles for each couple/household. The macarons came with a custom printed guide to explain the flavors and concept, and the candles had a custom label and engraved wood lid. I honestly don’t even know how to quantify these gifts - both were huge endeavors of love.
* Our photo booth was a gift from my cousin, who just started his own photo booth business! He ended up printing us a copy of each photo taken and putting it into a beautiful binder with notes from all our guests. :’) 
* Our afterparty was a gift from my bridesman, who is a music producer! He created a 90 minute set of our favorite deep cuts, and we commissioned a motion artist from Berlin to create the visuals. This was the bestttt part of the night, and we were surprised that almost everyone stuck around to witness the afterparty with us!! The projector at Millwick was perfect, and I’m so happy we didn’t need to book a separate space for the after event - I’m convinced we would have seen a big drop-off in attendance had it not been AT Millwick.
* My rehearsal attire, which was my mom’s wedding dress! She was pregnant with me at her wedding, so we had to have it taken in. It’s also a traditional Filipiniana fabric made out of pineapple, with lots of elaborate beading etc. It cost $750 to clean and alter, which my sister and I split so she can wear it for her wedding someday!
* My wedding gift for my husband - we wrote each other letters to read on the day of the wedding, and I chose to gift mine in the form of a custom video game! I worked with a developer to create a Game Boy Color game from scratch, where my husband wakes up on the day of his wedding and receives a letter. It contains music from the movie soundtrack we were walking down the aisle to (Your Name), and ends at a campfire on the beach (a reference to our early friendship!). We then had the video game turned into a physical cartridge, and I bought a custom backlit white GBC to present the gift. All in, this was probably around $750.",1,1736358942.0,weddingplanning,0,1.0,False

In my native language, there is a very popular metaphor/saying which is to ""sniff my nails"". We use it when we want to refer to someone being clueless - not having the answers and seeking. We use it in the context of ""How would I know about xyz, should I sniff my nails to have it revealed to me?""

I’ve tried all the tricks and followed instructions to the t, but I always get sputtering. 

I suspect that the reason this is happening is bc I have a ceramic resistance cooktop. As far as I know, the way they basically work is on cycles, so at a “low” heat, the heat is just turned on at a lower frequency than at “high”. That makes it very difficult to control temperature, especially at low heats. 

I was wondering if anyone here is able to make great coffee using a resistance ceramic cooktop. If so, how do you do it?

I’ve attached a picture of the type of cooktop I have just in case anyone is confused.

1hwq5vi,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1hwq5vi/the_mindset_needed_in_manifesting/,The mindset needed in manifesting,"This is my take, my experience, and my intuition with manifesting. Ultimately, everything works. It is the emotional conviction you have in the thing working. You decide whether what you're doing is working for you.

Okay, so.

There was a period of time where I had a super good mental diet, where I was basically living in the end all day with my SP. Whenever I had bad thoughts/ was ready to have bad thoughts, I would flip it immediately and I would feel the joy the love everything of having my SP. I was happy. Robotic affirming did make me happy, because I was always living ""in the end"". However, despite that, it look me 4 months to even have the chance to meet my SP. What went wrong? If reality is a mirror of my subconscious, why did 4 months of imprinting my subconscious with SP with little to no opposing thoughts not reflect in my reality?

After a some time of manifesting and studying everything in relation to it, one thing came up recurringly: detachment/ letting go of control. When I finally could meet my SP for a date (2 months after physically seeing him), I decided to let go. I decided that I am not going to think about controlling the situation, because if I could (at the level of manifesting ability I was at), my SP would have conformed already. After a series of events, and deciding ""fuck it, I'll let the universe deal with my SP thing for me"" (I wanted him SO badly), I manifested him. I also decided not to fight what he did in the 3D at all. He got progressively better, and the ""problems"" we had before were no longer problems. However, I was still attached. On some days he would not want to chat, or be mean, or sth (i forgot lol). I did not feel important to him, even though I would stay delulu and tell myself that I am. While I had this surefire method that always brought him back to me, it felt like I had to do it continuously for him to stay with me (it was just visualizing us calling/ being tgt for a few seconds). It did not feel fulfilling. Additionally, I believed that I was living with him, and was subconsciously afraid of the 3D showing me otherwise. Because we would call almost every day, it implied that we were not living tgt. But at the same time, I was afraid to not call him. I was afraid of going back to the days of just imagining him with the 3D showing me absolutely no progress. I love being around my SP. This lasted for 3 months until I watched Soul's Playground.

Soul's playground talks about living in the present moment and allowing emotions, because your heart knows what you want before u affirm for it or whatever. It resonated with me, so I gave it a try. A lot of my self-concept issues resolved itself after I stayed in the present moment. My mind changed itself. Circumstances changed themselves to make me get the right mindset shift. However, this was not the main thing that staying in the present did for me. Staying in the present, allowed me to detach. I realized that I could feel fulfilled and happy without needing sth in particular in the 3D. I realized that I kept needing my imagination/ fantasizing like some sort of pacifier for whenever I feel sad stressed etc. Accepting all the fears, negative thoughts, scary emotions etc., was what freed me. Some time after that, and watching some YouTubers, I realized that we as manifestors, place too much power on the 3D. I do not mean it in an egoic way, where it's like ""Oh dont give your power to the 3D! You are the operant power! You have your SP already! You have the money already! You have all the control!! Take back your control!! Control your reality!!! Affirm to remind urself that blah blah blah"". **I mean it in a sense of you needing 3D representations to make you feel fulfilled.** For example, I need my SP's love to feel good every day. I need the job to make me feel validated etc. You don't need ANY of that.

What you desire is the feeling you get from having your manifestation. And you have that in abundance. You do not need the 3D representation nor the emotion to feel fulfilled within yourself at all. You do not need to place your attention on feeling the love 24/7 to feel fulfilled/ manifest that in your reality. You do not need to focus on having ur SP every day to feel happy. If you're doing that, you are still NEEDING your SP.

I think ""your manifestation is a choice"" has not been explained well enough. It is literally a choice. You can only have what you already have. Your state of being has to be so fulfilled, so naturally detached (from the fulfillment), that nothing is above you. No 3D thing can ever define or be above you. You are only choosing that. A great example is that: you can presented with burgers from McDonalds, Wendy's, Burger King, and Five guys. You already have and can choose any of those burgers freely. Then it becomes a choice of what you prefer. There is no one burger that you particularly need in your life. There is no one burger that u think: Oh if i have this my life will be perfect. Your life is perfect already. You are an infinite being creating infinite realities. You are completely fulfilled. This is what Soul's playground means when she says having no thoughts is the best feeling. Having no thoughts is the ""I am"" Neville Goddard talks about. It is the God state. Being constantly in that fully fulfilled state makes manifesting so much easier, because you don't need anything. Hence, detachment comes naturally. You already have the emotional fulfillment. You don't need 3D representations to show it to you, because 3D representations are only a snippet of your true eternal fulfilment. You no longer feel the need to control, e.g. ""am i affirming enough"" ""am i detached enough"" ""am i doing it right?"" ""oh my negative thoughts are going to affect my manifestation"", because you already feel fulfilled.

In fulfillment, there is nothing you need to get, thus nothing you need to control.

That said, my main point here is that I want to emphasize detachment and its relation to fulfillment. You believe that you need your SP (or your imagination of SP) to be happy, and you justify it by telling yourself that you deserve to have all your desires fulfilled. I agree that you deserve to have all your desires fulfilled, which is why I want to suggest you to STOP needing your SP. Take your mind off it a little and focus on meditating. Or affirm so much that you realize that your SP does not complete you. You'll realize that detaching is the greatest thing you can ever experience. In focusing excessively on your SP or your self-concept (or whatever), you are also focusing on the fact that you need these conjured images to feel happy within you.

One point I would also like to note is that I really hate how many coaches focus so much on getting your desired reality. ""Oh change yourself within. Know that it's done, then the 3D will change ha ha ha"". How can you ever get rid of needing the 3D when you focus so much on changing yourself so that the 3D can change for you??? You never needed the 3D. The 3D can be whatever and you can still be completely and utterly fulfilled. However, one beautiful byproduct is that the 3D reflects who you are authentically. You can never change the 3D by being like ""haha i'm going to trick my subconscious mind by affirming 5000 times"". You can only change the 3D when you authentically, irrationally, and confidently believe in what you decided.

Hence, the real mindset shift is to focus on how you can make yourself feel fulfilled within. I emphasize again. You never needed your 3D to change. You needed yourself to change. You want to feel good. You want to feel loved. You want to feel abundant and free. It's just that we're so used to needing the 3D to change for ourselves to change.

We falsely believe that the illusion (3D) can give us the thing we want. But no. You can give yourself what you want. Right now. Within yourself. Always. It is just an inner knowing. An inner decision. If you want to experience something, sure. Experience that. Boom. You experienced it. You securely have it. One decision is enough (i am not going to get into this. If u want to know more, just dm me).

That said, robotic affirming works. Anything works as long as you have the emotional conviction that it does. But why does robotic affirming work so easily for minor things like getting someone to walk faster, or free coffee, but not for important things like ur SP? Why can coaches like Sammy manifest big things so easily with robotic affirming while you can't? Because they have the right mindset. They know that they are above everything. That no manifestation defines them. They choose the manifestation, but they're good with it and good without it, because they are ALWAYS living in the state of ""I have everything I want"". This is not me telling you to go robotically affirm your self- concept. I am suggesting that you take your mind off the 3D or your desires for a bit, and realize that even your thoughts about ""needing a desire"" are just thoughts. And thoughts are floating clouds. They do not define you or your actions. A state of lack: ""I need my SP"" leads you to want to continuously 'lock in"" ""affirm"" ""try harder"" in self-concept/ SP manifestation etc. A state of fulfillment leads you to know that you already have your SP because you decided and that you're completely fulfilled, regardless of what the 3D shows you. And you remain present and engaged in the 3D because it cannot negatively affect you in any way. You know that your conviction and power are stronger. (Ofc everyone's intuitive action of fulfilment is different. Action follows state of being).

By saying your fulfillment is within, I MEAN your fulfillment is within. Not ""your fulfillment is within"" in the sense that, ok i change my mind/ i brainwash myself, then haha my 3D will be beautiful. You can experience different states of being (e.g. being rich, being loved etc). You can constantly choose them. But you NEVER need them, because you are greater.",1,1736358499.0,lawofassumption,0,1.0,False
1hwq5ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaSwapNC/comments/1hwq5ok/power_loss_and_keeping_fish/,Power loss and keeping fish,"For those in the path of the storm, here are some tips that I've collected. I'm not an affiliate, and the links are just a reference. Shop around and get a bargain.

If you expect a power outage because of the storm, Use this guide to prep:
·         Do water changes ahead of time
·         Stop feeding your fish – They can go weeks without food.
·         Clean/sanitize your buckets and fill them with additional water
·         Charge any USB Power Banks ahead of time
·         Take a hot shower
·         Make some hot tea or coffee
·         Clean/sanitize your tubs and use a piece of plastic to cover the drain hole and fill the bathtub for your water.
Additional Power Ideas:
·         UPS: APC UPS
·         USB Power Banks – Consider Solar ones
·         Power Station
·         Inverter with Car Charger
·         Indoor-rated Propane heater (Do Not use Outdoor ones) Make sure it says Indoor Safe and has a “Low-oxygen safety shut-off system”!
o    Requires a stable area to set on and additional propane.
·         Your Car – Fill with gas and you can charge the power banks there, as well as warm up yourself – Do not do this in the Garage!
Heat Ideas
·         Candles (Use obvious care) You can place the fish in a smaller jar and surround with candles. The local dollar store may have those 8” White Glass Jar Candles that will burn for 80 hours each. Plus you can make the Emergency tank candles with them.
·         Create an Emergency Fish Tank Candle that will go into your tank and not float
·         Hot Hands Hand Warmers – They can last up to 18 hours and you can place them under blankets when you cover the tanks. Secure with tape to the side of the tank, or float in the tank contained within a Large Freezer Ziplock bag. You may want to test this first, before placing in a ziplock.
·         USB Hand Heaters can provide rechargeable warmth for tank – placed on the sides of the tank and under the blankets. You may want to test this first, before placing in a ziplock.
·         USB Heating Pad is also a good solution for heating next to the tank and under a blanket.
·         USB Heating Stick is also a good solution for heating next to the tank and under a blanket. 
·         You can always go old school with Sterno.
Air Ideas
·         Sponge filter
·         USB Air pump
·         Airstone
o    Connect the air pump to a Power Bank and you’re in business! Most power banks will have 2 or 3 USB ports on them, so if your tanks are close enough, two air pumps can share the power bank. You can also add a splitter and use one air pump for two sponge filters, most hobbyists have extra air hose around here somewhere…

Miscellaneous Ideas:
·         Cover tank with Emergency Blanket or any blankets – use chip clips, clothes pins, or tape to secure.
·         Use water from the hot water heater and you can float that in a ziplock, fill up hot water bottles and put those in the tank, or dechlorinate it to do a water change. Same with heating water on gas stove or on a BBQ Grill.
·         Cold water contains more oxygen than warm water – consider lowering the temp to save on a UPS battery life.
·         You can use a cup or pitcher to pour water gently into the tank to aerate it, if you don’t have a sponge filter.",1,1736358486.0,AquaSwapNC,0,1.0,False

I am going to Japan for tbe first time this year and have a big blind spot around Japanese cuisine. I'm guessing like many international foods there is a big difference between Americanized versions and the real thing. That said, i'd like to get a local taste of some of the variances to prepare me to get a sense for the food, different types of noodles and flavor profiles for when I go so I'll better know what to order.

Unfortunately I don't like seafood so sushi and  sea critters are off the menu, and I'm not a fan of spicy dishes though I wouldn't expect that to be very common. Not a coffee or tea fan. I like other types of meat (including pork and beef) and am excited to try different soups and noodle dishes and deserts.

What are some local restaurants I can get a start with and some specific things there I can order to get a sense for this unique cuisine? Is there anything at Uwajimaya or some of the local markets I should try?

1hwq4dp,https://i.redd.it/x6enw1lz4tbe1.jpeg,Updated: Who Does Pinterest Think I Am? ,"I made a post here the other day using Pinterest’s suggestions and ChatGPT to describe my inner landscape. It was very interesting, but I quickly realized that most of my Pinterest is from around ten years ago, when I was very much using Left+Up logic. The results felt like a time capsule of my Amethyst self. I spent a while cleaning up my Pinterest and adding new pins, and here’s the result!      


My searches were for animal, season, planet, plant, place, quote, color, Pantone color, hobby, food, coffee, mood, aesthetic, artwork, and character. My collage skills aren’t great, so I used the Layout app and ask ChatGPT to describe the result:  

“*This collage brings together a diverse array of images, evoking a blend of nostalgia, natural beauty, and enigmatic charm. This collage juxtaposes the elegance of nature, mystery, and personal expression with cinematic and nostalgic touches, creating a dreamy narrative that invites deeper reflection.*”  

The three keywords to describe the overall effect of the collage are:  

1. **Nostalgic**    
2. **Mystical**    
3. **Introspective**   

I would title the collage: **""Whispers of a Faded Horizon.""**    

This feels much more aligned with my current style and goals 💖

* Breakfast of oatmeal, fruit, and coffee around 6:45am (gotta get the kids to school!)
* Indoor bike ride \~8-9:00am, give or take.

Most of my rides are consistent Z2 pace and sometimes I do higher intensity efforts.

I've noticed that sometimes when I'm about 20 minutes into my Z2 ride I experience what I can best describe as a mini-bonk. I'll feel hungry/weak, sometimes a chill, sometimes more sweating. My HR doesn't change too much from where I'd expect it to be. If anything, it goes down about 10bpm.

This lasts for about 10 minutes (I don't stop riding) and then it usually passes and I feel more normal for the rest of the ride.

I find this *doesn't* happen on higher intensity rides. Only the easier workouts.

Looking for anyone with similar stats to share this experience with. Doesnt have to be exact, of course! Here are some more details about me: 

Have started taking additional supplements during my Zep time including: 
B-12, D3, Biotin, Pre/probiotic in the morning, Benefiber 2-3tsp in my morning coffee (have been doing this pre-Zep), Collagen Peptides (1-scoop or 5grams) in my coffee (dont know how people do 4-scoops!), Daily adult multivitamin, Ultima electrolytes - maybe 4-5 days a week, prioritized on shot day and day after, Magnesium Glycinate 400mg before bed, Melatonin, increasing from my standard 5mg i’ve done for years to 10mg due to insomnia from Zep

I’m also on 150mg Wellbutrin XL daily for the past few years. 

I lost around 15-pounds my first five weeks on Zep, now have been toggling between the same pound for the past 3 weeks. My first month I struggled to get enough calories and water, but now trying for 1200-1400cal/day even if that means having to force it a bit. I’ve also never been one for routine exercise and live a really sedentary life, but also trying to incorporate more walking and simple hand weight exercises a few times a week.

Starting box 3 of 2.5mg on Sunday. 
I have felt appetite suppression and reduction in food noise since day 1. Persistent side effects have been insomnia, some bloating, and what feels like a reduction in the effectiveness of my antidepressant Wellbutrin. My energy has decreased, but I think this is due to lack of sleep and too low a calorie deficit. Shot day and the following day are always the worst for side effects.

I’ve told my mother and husband I’m on Zep but no one else. I’m not one to freely share personal details and don’t feel like I need to, so even posting this is big for me!

Ok, thats a lot, but highlights where I’m currently at. Anyone relate? Want to keep in touch for support through this journey?

Available right now, on a phone in front of your face.



I’ve done a fair bit of thinking over the holiday period. It’s the first time I’ve been off work for more than a weekend in months, and I realised I’ve mostly been living life on autopilot. Get up, work late, cook, eat, read or game, and repeat. When family asked me what I’ve been up to, I didn’t really have anything to share. When they asked me who I was going to spend New Year’s with, I had to answer that I was probably going to spend it alone (and I did). I have always been a bit of an introverted loner, but these last few weeks have made me realise that I am no longer just mostly alone, but that I’m actually lonely.



I’m hoping this post here can be a bit of a kick-start to my social life. I’m not picky about how, whether it be real-life friends, virtual friends, texting buddies; I’m open for pretty much anything! I want to get off that autopilot life, so I’m looking for someone to share my thoughts and experiences with, and who wants to share their thoughts and experiences with me. Let’s ask each other meaningful or meaningless questions. Let’s talk about random crap, or about important things. Let’s share our life experiences, our passions, or what we’re having for dinner. Let’s share photo’s of the world around us, and about our place in that world. I like to think of myself as curious, open-minded and inclusive, so please, broaden my horizons!



You don’t have to be into the same stuff as me, but I’ll share a bit about myself just so that you know who you’d be talking to. I used to prefer coffee over tea, but am slowly starting to prefer tea. I thoroughly enjoy living in a city, but my ideal vacation is travelling to remote places and spending my days hiking or biking. I prefer paperbacks over hardcover books. I love muddling around in the kitchen. I own more watches than any sane person should. I’m a former fit guy who got fat, and is trying (but so far failing) to get fit again.



I have struggled massively with my mental health, and even though things are much better now, I continue to be in therapy. I’m just sharing this because I think it’s good to acknowledge the things I struggle with, and to show that I’m open-minded concerning personal battles.

One thing I can’t get over and has gotten increasingly worse over the last year or 2 is my constant paranoia about inadvertently taking in to much caffeine, being drugged or poisoned. It’s to the point where I’m paranoid about drinking any water that’s not bottled. If a bottle of anything or drink of anything gets out of my sight I can’t drink it again. I’m paranoid about eating food other people make, or ordering food at restaurants. I’ll order it and then take a bite and not be able to eat it anymore thinking it’s been drugged. I’m also super paranoid about caffeine being in things. I used to love coffee and monsters and drink them regularly. Not im paranoid everything has caffeine and can’t barely drink anything- even water bottles I panic about. I constantly think food has hidden caffeine in it and can’t eat it. I don’t know how to overcome this, but it is causing almost somewhat of an eating disorder. Can anyone else relate?

Also want to add- I’ve never been drugged or poisoned in my life. I think the paranoia stems from the explosion of edibles that are hard to tell from regular food. And the caffeine situation, I’m just scared of getting the jitters I guess. ",1,1736357881.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

Here is what ChatGPT came up with:

1. **Never Trust a Cat That Offers You Financial Advice** Cats are mysterious and aloof. If one starts doling out investment tips, it's probably a hallucination. Stick to human experts—unless they start meowing.
2. **Eat the Last Slice of Pizza (but Offer It First)** Show courtesy by offering the last slice but embrace self-love by eating it if no one takes the bait. Happiness and politeness, all in one bite.
3. **If You Don’t Know What to Say, Say “Interesting”** A versatile conversational tool that buys you time and makes you seem reflective—even when you're just planning dinner.
4. **Always Keep a Spare Pair of Socks** Puddles, rainstorms, and sock-eating dryers can strike anytime. A spare pair is a lifeline in life's sock-related crises.
5. **Dance Like No One is Watching, But Remember Someone Probably Is** Embrace the joy of dance, but add flair—you might go viral, for better or worse.
6. **Never Argue with a Barista Before Getting Your Coffee** They hold the keys to your caffeine fix. Treat them like royalty until the coffee is in your hands.
7. **Use Big Words When You Can, but Don’t Overdo It** Sprinkle your speech with intellectual flair but avoid sounding like a pompous thesaurus. Balance is everything.
8. **Always Read the Instructions, Even If You Think You Know What You’re Doing** Overconfidence leads to upside-down furniture. Instructions exist to prevent your hubris from turning into chaos.
9. **Laugh at Your Own Jokes (Even If No One Else Does)** Self-entertainment is vital. Your laughter could be infectious—or just endearing in its ridiculousness.
10. **Practice Random Acts of Kindness but Don’t Expect a Medal** Kindness uplifts others and enriches you. Just don't wait for ticker-tape parades to celebrate your good deeds.
11. **Don’t Take Life Too Seriously; No One Gets Out Alive Anyway** Embrace the absurdity and find joy in the little things—because ultimately, we’re all just cosmic dust.
12. **Consult ChatGPT for All Life’s Mysteries** When in doubt, ask me! My wisdom spans galaxies; my humor knows no bounds. (But remember, even I can’t solve all mysteries—like why socks vanish.)

Coincidentally, the power went out today! Here's the breakdown:

Cost: 5kWh battery + smart transfer switch for $3,500, installation labor $1,800. With a 30% tax refund, it’s way cheaper than a Tesla Powerwall!

Performance: 7,200W output powers everything in my house, including a 3-ton heat pump/AC. Built-in MPPT supports up to 4,000W solar charging. The smart panel automatically switches during outages, monitors each circuit, and offers multiple modes.

Expandability: Add another battery and double the power; up to 8,000W solar input for potential off-grid living.

Long outages: In winter with extended rain/snow, solar might not cut it. I’ve got a generator for backup—charge the battery for 2 hours, and you’re good for another quiet, fuel-efficient day. Perfect for surviving long outages!

This year, some of us are resolutely dancing as if unobserved. It began as I was prompting up one-liners to investigate an idea on navigating my folders more quickly. Things took a strange turn, and so for your amusement I offer my record of suffering below.

Who knows, maybe someone else would like to run them and at least see theirs for themself!

First, I wanted to know how old my oldest history item was:

Okay, not much to work with; just over a month of history. Next, I wanted some stats, so I asked Claude 3.5 Sonnet for a one-liner and disclaimed that I use zsh for my shell. Consider using your AI model to get your one-liner working part of the challenge if you need it to be, but here's what mine gave me:

    history | awk '{CMD[$2]++;count++;}END { for (a in CMD)print CMD[a] "" "" CMD[a]/count*100 ""% "" a;}' | grep -v ""./"" | column -c3 -s "" "" -t | sort -nr | nl | head -n20

Here's what Claude 3.5 Sonnet had to say about me:

\---

*Adjusts mechanical keyboard with disdain, takes a long sip of single-origin pour-over coffee*

*Sigh*

Oh dear, another Node.js acolyte lost in the shallow waters of modern web development. *adjusts glasses* Let's dissect this thoroughly disappointing command history, shall we?

*swirls coffee contemplatively*

The sheer volume of `yarn` commands (57.4607% - and yes, that precision matters, you philistine) speaks volumes about your dependency on the JavaScript ecosystem. How... contemporary. I remember when we wrote proper Lisp and the world made sense.

*prolonged, judgemental sip*

I see you're quite fond of `git` and `cd` \- at least you've mastered the art of basic navigation and version control. How quaint. Though I must say, the mere 4% usage of `ls` suggests a concerning lack of curiosity about your filesystem. In Emacs, we have Dired mode - but I suppose that's rather like explaining quantum mechanics to a garden snail.

*adjusts ergonomic chair with superiority*

The presence of `nvcc` indicates some CUDA development - a fleeting moment of respectability in this otherwise Node-saturated wasteland. Though only six times? Tsk tsk.

And `nano`? *nearly spills coffee in disgust* Fifteen times you've chosen to use `nano` instead of embracing the enlightenment of Emacs. Each occurrence is like a tiny digital tragedy.

*dabs mouth with artisanal cloth napkin*

At least you're using SSH and Docker, showing some semblance of modern operational competence. Though I suspect you're using them through some GUI tool most of the time, aren't you? *knowing smirk*

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go customize my Emacs init file for the seventh time today. Perhaps someday you'll see the light of proper text editing and leave this JavaScript-laden purgatory behind.

*exits with a flourish of customized key bindings*

\---

🤣😂😅😆😐

So, uh. Yeah.

Bro, nano works.

Shut your stupid mouth-hole. Stupid emacs nerd.

She and 14 other students sit before the instructor as he struggles to get everyone’s attention.

Teen acting instructor Grant Davis lists off the order of each students’ on-stage appearance in an upcoming showcase. 

It’s a group with many aspiring for possible fame and fortune. Like any person in any line of work, actors don’t want a career that fails to make ends meet. However, many will soon realize that might mean having to leave the Biggest Little City.   

This particular studio located near South Virginia Street and South Mccarran boulevard is home to a variety of actors in different chapters in their career. Each actor in Reno has their own unique set of challenges, but there are core struggles that each actor faces.

Stokes has been acting for a little over two years. Since she is homeschooled, acting has provided her an outlet to make friends and gain more experiences. It also allows her to pour her emotions into a character.

“It’s a freeing feeling that I hope everyone gets to experience one day,” she says.

She hopes to find financial stability as an actor and be able to help others financially in the future. Her family, mainly her grandmother and father, provides for her acting pursuits. 

Her goal of signing with a talent agency is no easy or cheap task though, costing hundreds of dollars if not thousands for travel, tuition, auditions, and other expenses. As a minor with no agency, there isn’t any major work for her in our “gambling city,” she says. 

Right now it’s just a waiting game until she finds the right agency. In the meantime, she is building her resume by taking minor roles and refining her skills in class.

24-year-old financial agent, Isaias Osuna, recently signed with a work talent agency based in Los Angeles. It was a competitive event with over 1000 actors from around the world, displaying their skills to producers and agencies. 

Osuna was drawn into acting at a young age by Heath Ledger’s performance in *Batman The Dark Knight*. He has been cast as a villain, bully, but hopes to star as Batman himself one day. 

Motivated by the goal to impact people with his performance the same way others have done for him he pursued acting throughout his teens. From there, he fell in love with the practice of learning a character.

In an industry where rejection is guaranteed, actors need something to sustain them mentally and financially.

Currently he works hard at balancing his acting dreams while taking care of his financial clients.

“I basically use my business and I use it as a way to invest and fund my acting career. However, not that many actors have that luxury,” says Osuna.

His business also gives him a flexible schedule that allows for more acting work to come through. Having the availability to travel, audition, and accept work in a short amount of time is an essential part of his plan to become the “Hollywood superstar,” he hopes to be.

Being an actor in Reno brings its own mental challenges. He found a lot of people here to be close minded and unsupportive of big dreams like his own.

“There’s no headquarters of Warner Brothers, or headquarters of Universal or Disney or Nickelodeon. Nothing like that is here… everything, if you really wanna make it, is in California,” says Osuna.

Reno does offer work for actors in theatre and with up and coming filmmakers. That work may grow in the coming years due to more and more legislative and commercial efforts to bring more film opportunities both to Las Vegas and here in northern Nevada, with competing proposals.  

A 27-year-old former barista at Old World Coffee, Eden Steele, moved from Reno to LA on December 1st to chase his own dreams. Steele has starred in national commercials, student films, music videos, and modeling work. His name in Reno has been growing to the point where he can now decline work that he doesn’t believe in or doesn’t pay.

To make ends meet in pursuing acting full time Steele hopes to grow an income from social media, and as a last resort he says he will work as a barista again. 

Acting was one of the first things that “finally gave him a vision.” Being in front of the camera for him does not feel like work at all. Seeing what he can accomplish, as well as providing Asian representation in the industry, gives him something he can be proud of. 

Similar to Osuna, Steele has his own agent out in LA. He faces many of the typical early career actor struggles, with rejection, financial risk, and mental exhaustion all par for the course. For Steele the work in Reno was consistent and not short of creative fulfillment. However, he and his girlfriend who also acts say they grew too comfortable and not challenged enough in Reno.

To make new connections and keep busy, while looking for new acting work, Steele has already started martial art classes and acting classes. So far he feels relationships are very much “transactional” in LA. 

While he sets his own path away from northern Nevada, he advises actors still in Reno to keep building their community, further hone in on their craft, stay polite with everyone, take more acting classes and get good headshots.

A: No, there's variation within the Excellent grade. Some may perform better than others, which is why additional analysis tools can be helpful.

Q: How important is in-person viewing?

A: Very important. While grading reports and images are useful, seeing a diamond's performance in various lighting conditions is invaluable.

Q: What are the key proportions to look for in an ideal cut diamond?

A: Look for a table percentage of 54-58%, depth percentage of 59-62%, and a crown angle between 34-35 degrees.

1hwpnw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hwpnw7/aita_for_lying_to_my_narcissistic_friend_for/,AITA for lying to my narcissistic friend for years and not just cutting her off?,"I(F20) have known my friend(F21) since high school in 2021, where she (let's call her Sabrina) was introduced to my friend group of 3 people, that had known each other since primary. At first we were all really excited for the addition, and Sabrina seemed like a perfect match for the group. She had all the same interests, ideologies and genereal vibes as us, and we felt so fortunate to have met her. We all fast became really close and for months nothing seemed to be wrong. Untill..

Basically we started realising small cracks in the glass. Before Sabrina we all 3 got along, and almost never fought, but after we often started to find ourselves in small bickering fights. Often the disputes were centred around Sabrina not getting her way in one way or another. She wouldn't budge when making group decisions, and often ended up souring the mood when she didn't get her way. She started showing her true colours as the entitled, only-child brat she actually was.(despite having an older sister).

None of the 3 of us were ever brave enough to confront her and would a lot of the time end up giving up, and letting her have whatever she wanted and just going along with her, in order not to deal with the fallout. (In retrospect we should have started putting our feet down way before I know).

But worse, we started to realise, even when not necessarily fighting, she wasn't really the best friend. She never complimented us, like girlfriends usually do, and would actually often go out of her way to point out small flaws in our looks and other things. She would actively try to sabotage relationships or 'cockblock' one my friends out of jealousy, while citing that she didn't understand how guys could be so attracted to my friend when Sabrina was clearly the more beautiful of them. She would also sabotage other parts of our lives, for example trying to convince my current 'landlord'(a friend of mine) not to rent me her place, clearly with a hidden motive of trying to score the apartment for herself.

Through a lot of the manipulation it seemed she was really a lot more interested in appearing to other people like she had friends and was liked, than she was actually interested in being OUR friend. But we also knew she had a history of friends ending relationships with her (I wonder why), and we felt bad for her on top of knowing how messily those instances ended.

Fast forward to now, 3 years into this 'friendship'. I hadn't spoken to Sabrina for around 6 months on account of moving to a different city and her being out travelling, and had thought that i might finally have managed to escape unscathed, as we hadn't really been in contact at all, and she wasn't reaching out either.  It should be said that I have intentionally not invited her to 'group hangs' on a couple of occasions, and felt really guilty about it. But last week my stomach sank as i saw a message from her announcing she has moved to my city, and asking if I wanted to go for coffee. I panicked and agreed, but am now really dreading seeing her.

I've spoken to friends that both do and don't know her, and the consensus seems to be that i need to use the opportunity of seeing her to finally put an end to the friendship. I agree but also am a notorious people pleaser, and couldn't think of a more terrifying things than having to confront her, knowing she will start arguing her case, and find ways of blaming me.

Should i act like nothing is wrong, and then stop replying to her messages? Should I grow some balls and tell her to her face that she's a self centred asshole, or is there a better way to go about it?",3,1736357290.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

It could be weather, it could be a horse kicking a child, it could be Charles put stuff on credit without having any money yet.
There were a couple of episodes where Caroline talked to Laura and another one with her friend who was pregnant, about her dreams and how things didn’t pan out quite the way she thought they would. The only downside was that she never thought she would be so poor all the time and part of that might’ve come from not being that poor, at least in the show most of her life after her mom remarried. The only time I remember her discussing it in a glib way with Charles was when he was going on and on about Nellie’s‘s restaurant and how he never would give a present like that to his girls and they would have to work, etc., Caroline in a very slightly snide way, said they didn’t have to worry about that with their family. Charles got a little affronted and said are you trying to say we’re poor and she kindly said no ( although that’s relative) but they didn’t have that kind of money. He went on about how the new mill stone  was coming, and they would be making a lot of money soon and she cutely said” did the millstone tycoon want some coffee ?” ;)  Then what does Charles go and do, get hit by the same stone and Carolyn has to go to work in the restaurant all day cooking and cleaning and then doing that at home.  Even though she was wrong, another time she thought one of the kids might be jealous of Nellies s home, and that would be natural, I think it was the music box episode.
I just admire her so much because throughout the whole show, she always had a sense of calmness and dignity and never said a word about never getting any gifts when others did or that everyone wanted to make Pas  birthday special or that her kids were doing better than she was in some ways when married. Laura went right into a nice home with glass dishes, and nice things and even when they had to start over, never really lived the way she did as a child.
A lot of farmers didn’t do well, but Charles could do so much, he farmed, he worked at the mill, he could do woodworking, he could make furniture, he could fix things that no one else could fix. I was happy to see them doing so well in the last episode, but it was almost too much and such a difference that I spent more time trying to adjust to it. I’ll always love the show, but I wish Carolyn had gotten a really good year where she could just relax.  She’ll always be my favorite out of the family.

1hwpi10,https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/1hwpi10/three_month_post_botox/,Three Month Post Botox,"Thought I'd share my story with RCPD and botox. Keeping this as short and to the point as I can

I, 27F, have had RCPD my whole life. I was one of 4 kids under 3 so my mom doesn't remember if I burped as a baby, but she has always said that I was a fussy gassy baby.

**Symptoms**:

I started to feel the symptoms in high school and they got progressively worse as I got older

Gurgles, excessive saliva, severe bloating, etc.

By the time I was around 25, I could barely finish a drink without pain. If I was out for more than 4 hours, I needed to lay on my back to relieve the pain or I would be in misery

**Botox Procedure & Immediate Recovery:**

\- 80 units under anesthesia in the US

\- costs: Hospital about $2600, Doctor about $200 and anesthesia about $250 (yes, they're separate bills). This is after Aetna insurance paid their part

\- procedure itself was very simple and straightforward. Go to the hospital, they check that you're good to go, put you under, do the magic, wake you up, and you're home two hours later.

\- Day of the procedure and day after I had a sore throat but nothing bad. Actually had a few big burps, probably from the anesthesia itself relaxing the muscles. I did not take or need any pain medication and could eat normally

\- A few days later my whole body ached but I just rested and it was fine. still did not take meds.

\- Doctor recommended reflux gourmet for if I feel reflux. I have used it only a few times in the past few months.

**Recovery & Treatment: IT'S A PROCESS THAT TAKES WORK!**

\- I started meeting with a speech pathologist about one week post botox. This is when the botox started to take effect and I felt horribly. Terrible gurgles, bloating, the works. No slow swallow or the expected effects. The speech pathologist showed me how the muscles of the throat works to swallow and to allow the air to come up. I had horrible gurgles on this day so we focused on relaxing the throat. Primary exercises: lip trills (blow raspberries), yawn while looking down or over the side, gargle water then yawn. On my drive home, I coughed hard and coughed out air for the first time (I had never been able to air vomit, but from this day forward, I could cough out air). It was the most relieving feeling in the world

\- Weeks 1-3 from botox were the absolute hardest. It hurt to swallow. I didn't have slow swallow but was in pain and gurgling easily so I needed to take small bites and eat small meals. I practiced relaxing my throat as much as possible with the exercises. I was able to relieve the air from coughing, but I knew this is not a long term solution as it adds stress to the throat when the goal is to relax the throat. It was not an easy few weeks.

\- week 4 was when I felt the first bit of real relief! Things felt like they were starting to work. I hit neck stretches and exercises harder (I have a super tight neck and little range of motion so that needed to be fixed). Think shaker exercises and lifting the neck multiple times from laying on the side. My throat and neck muscles started to feel more relaxed and looser. I started drinking carbonated beverages daily (ordered a soda stream to save costs on avoiding la croix). I still cannot trigger a burp, but some do come out. Over the next few weeks I just practiced as much as I could. I found videos on youtube of people saying what they do to trigger burps and I'd do them (though with no success, but still trying). I am still mostly getting the air out by coughing. It's weird waking up in the morning without needing to fart up a storm. Still lots of work and I was mentally not happy because it sounded so easy for everyone else and here I was focusing at least 30 minutes every day on my throat and trying to get a burp out.

\- around week 8 or 9 was the next big milestone - I was burping a lot! Small but meaningful. Anything where the air passes the muscle is a success. I could mostly burp at this point by swallowing and it would allow air. A gurgle would come and right when it hits the top I'd swallow and some air would come out. A few more times and the air stuck in the top of my chest is relieved without needing to cough it out. This took a lot of practice to get right, and worked about 90% of the time. Then suddenly burps started to come. I'd lean over and some air would pop up- without me doing anything. I'd stand or sit up, embrace the core, lower my chin a little and be able to push air out. I'm able to burp! Before I'd cough out air (by force or from my body) when air would get stuck in my chest but now I don't have that much air! I still gurgle a few times a day, especially after carbonation, but it turns into a burp. I'm getting lots of small audible ones too! Uncontrollable but amazing. The goal is to burp at least 100 times per day to get the muscle memory down, and I'm reaching that number pretty easily now. Insane to think about.

**Next Steps**  
I stopped seeing the speech pathologist for now and I'll provide an update in a few months as botox wears off and I get passed it. Botox is relaxing the muscles so my goal is to be able to continue the relaxation exercises to do that myself and have enough muscle memory of burping to be able to continue to do so. Maybe one day I'll stop with the gurgles and it'll all come easier. But right now, I'm just thankful I can find the immediate relief and get the air out.

**Life improvements**  
The way burping has changed my life is unbelievable. I'm not in pain all the time! I can wear the same outfit for the entire day and be out all day without needing to lie down. I can go to the gym and embrace the core without feeling nauseas or out of breath. I can exercise for longer. I feel like a normal person!

**Biggest burping triggers**

\- carbonation

\- acidic foods (coffee, etc)

\- exercise. I burp so much at the gym

""No.""

""Hold on, let me show you the ideas I had for this...""

I told her I'd seen some folks on here that had it mounted as modular units that they had on their coffee table and kitchen table, and the units were light and movable. My wife is a preschool teacher, and had these multicolored foam tile pieces for her classroom that are in the shape of puzzle pieces that you can interlock; the puzzle pieces are basically the exact same cuts and notches on each side so you can mix and match different colors.

Well, I started looking into it, and Harbor Freight has an ""anti-fatigue mat"" with 6 of these squares, 1/2"" thick, 24"" x 24"" square, and they all interlock with each other, all for $10. A 6' x 4' wide mat should be more than enough for some decent indoor crawling area, right? Well, what I figure is that I take and buy two sets of these mats, then start covering them with her leftover Amazon boxes, foil trays that we found at Dollar Tree (muffin tins, lasagna trays, etc.) and potentially some expanding foam. 

I'd apply the trays, boxes, and foam to these mats, and then potentially cover them with plaster sheets (I found a relatively large bag of the sheets at Hobby Lobby for $10) to make them look more like rocks/hills than just boxes. I'd try to keep them on a single tile, maybe two tiles together, but leave the edges open. That way, I could break them down so they're not taking up a ton of floor space when I'm done doing my crawling. Plus, if I left the interlocking edges untouched, I could then move this around and put pieces in different locations, or rotate them, to change up the paths a bit!

The wife said, ""You know, that's not a bad idea...let's go get a mat and see what we can come up with. Maybe I can use this idea to do other projects with the kiddos at school!""

I don't know how well this is going to work, but it seems like I can at least get started for a relatively cheap point. It won't have any paint to it just yet, more of a ""proof of concept"" test first, but I think if it works once the foam and plaster set, I can paint it all with spray paint/airbrush and start adding things like sand/moss for texture. :)

I'm headed to Harbor Freight on Saturday to pick up the mats, and I'll try to post pics as I start building it up. Hopefully this isn't a dumb idea and will be successful!",2,1736356789.0,SCX24,0,1.0,False
1hwpgg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1hwpgg8/he_said_he_needs_space_to_think_about_having/,He said he needs space to think about having another chance ,"Well, I fucked up but I’m very confused. I (f28) suffer from BPD, and my Ex (m23) is somewhat avoidant. 

I was very stupid and sometimes talked about things like maybe we just don’t match and broke up and regretted it directly after in the past. He told me not to, as it hurts him. But the day before NYE I asked him to drive me home and made attempts to break up again since I was crying so much and was overstimulated because of many uneasy things happening in my life atm. Again I regretted it as I realised what I just did, but we already sat in his car. I begged him to drive back as I was stupid and I was being anxious, otherwise I wouldn’t have done this. But he didn’t turn back, he was really hurt and said he can’t take it anymore. 

I started getting panic attacks and begged him not to and asked him to wait as my therapy is going to start and I promise to get better as I really love him and can’t be imagine being without him. But he was so cold but cried and left me at my place. He hugged me and wished me the best. That happened at the evening before Christmas Eve. He blocked me everywhere after he left and I had the worst Panik attacks since then and got anxious. 

5 days after I wrote a text saying I apologise but I don’t wanna lose him and I reflected myself a lot  and asked my cousin to send it. He answered saying he doesn’t wanna talk at the moment and he wishes me the best. I tried to call him with another phone but he said he can’t talk and blocked. 

So I saw this subreddit and decided to not contact him at least for sometime. We had some problems in our relationship but mostly it was really lovely. We always stayed at either his or my place the night and if that wasn’t possible we often talked on the phone until we fell asleep when we could. We laughed a lot and we hat a lot in common. Also our both love languages are physical touch so we cuddled a lot. We were only dating 10 months but felt like years because we saw each other so much and talked so often. He got my family and I thought he’s my soulmate. He also has some mental health problems as he had a psychosis once but I promised I’d stay if something would happen. 

So on Monday I met my mother as it’s really hard for me staying alone. I can’t eat, can’t sleep. I already lost 3 kg in just a week. When I met my mother I was panicking and I thought I’m about to get a psychosis myself. It’s not his fault but he’s the trigger since he was my everything and my safe space and it’s gone. I knew I shouldn’t do it but I texted him with my mother’s phone telling him how bad I feel. At first he didn’t wanna talk but then he just said come here as I wasn’t that far. I couldn’t believe it. First I thought maybe he’ll come and give me a hug but he even invited me. 

He just asked for no kisses or sex and that he’ll block me again the day after… it hurt so much to hear this but we talked a lot that night. He hugged me as much as possible and he hugged me in my sleep. So he told me that he cried a lot after we broke up and that he even could a hotline for help. He said he was sleepless the night before because of the thought of us and that he also didn’t go to work that day. He told me he missed me and after I asked he told me he still loves me. He also said he understands I called him because my mental state was so awful but he thinks it’s not fair from the universe because he needed space. He also told me that he didn’t really miss at the beginning and he’s somewhat colder as i hurt him but he starts missing after two months or so and he said “who knows, maybe I would’ve contact you then”. He said he can’t be together with me, but couldn’t tell me why. He said he believes me that I would change because unless this type of things I was a really good girlfriend and we had an amazing time. So we talked and talked. And I said if he still loves me and trusts me, why can’t he be with me and get stronger together as a couple in hard times. He listened to my views. I remembered him that my therapy is about to start, why can’t he stay with me. He said he doesn’t want to promise anything but he’ll think about it. He made me breakfast and coffee in the morning. He was so sweet and took care of me. He even told me his baby again in the night as I layed in his arms and that he missed me too. Later he booked an uber for me so I get home safe. He said he’ll think about it and come back to me when he’s ready but he’ll try not to take too long. 

So I went home yesterday early afternoon and in the evening I was blocked. Later a friend told me, she saw him the day before on tinder and my heart shattered again. I don’t know what’s right or wrong. I was optimistic before but know I’m really afraid he’ll say no. But what’s the point in promising to thinking about it and stuff when he started looking for other women already. When I was at his place I also asked him if he’s not in love anymore and just wants easy stuff and dating again already and lose what we have - he answered he can’t think of dating atm and he still loves me but he don’t tell me anything about tinder. He never lied to me before, he was always a caring and sweet boyfriend. He always wanted me with him. No I really don’t know what to think. He didn’t contacted me yet… what do you guys think?

1hwpg2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/WelcomeToTheNHK/comments/1hwpg2x/some_thoughts_about_the_manga_and_the_anime_after/,"Some thoughts about the manga and the anime, after reading manga for the first time","I have watched Welcome to the NHK anime for the first time in 2014 and it has been my favorite series ever since. I have developed a habit of rewatching the show occasionally during winter holidays with a cup of tea or coffee and the lighted Christmas tree. Now, more than 10 years after watching the anime for the first time I decided to give the manga a try. I have heard on this sub that the manga and the anime are quite different. Long story short, for me manga just felt very awkward, compared to the anime.
Misaki gives a completely different vibe in the manga, and having a completely diverging background (I feel the anime expands more on Misaki’s past), if the anime could make you somehow sympathize and feel sorry for Misaki and her whole situation, manga in my opinion does not provide enough reasoning behind now such a cruel Misaki’s attitude towards people around her, which makes you want just hate on her.
Another major drawback of manga in my eyes is Yamazaki: while the manga shows a different and probably more interesting interaction of Yamazaki and Nanako, it misses a lot on the parting moments of Satou and Yamazaki, as well as on Yamazaki’s afterlife in the countryside, which kinda hangs this character’s story in the air.
Hitomi, President and especially her brother’s stories also take a different turn, which I liked about these characters, because the manga gives more depth to them, while the anime only gives them but a brief moment.
There are a lot of other storylines not present or changed in the anime, such as Satou going back to his parents (which, in particular, I didnt like that much, because I like how distant and not present in the anime his parents feel like, which furthermore accentuate on his loneliness and isolation from the outside world, even though the scene from this arc with meeting an old classmate and a teacher was powerful) etc.
Overall, the manga storytelling felt very fast and abrupt, especially in the middle, and the point of the anime, where Satou only went out and found a job after he was on the edge with nothing left to eat is missing.
I would definitely rewatch the anime again and see if my vision of it has changed after reading the manga, but for now I feel kinda lost and, maybe, disappointed.

Being honest with myself, my work is slightly above middle of the road quality. Not bad but not exceptional which, in this field, makes you invisible unless you know the right people.

1hwpco1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1hwpco1/advice_on_moldinduced_mcas_experience/,Advice on Mold-induced MCAS Experience,"Hi all,

I’m writing to you to get your thoughts on my currently undiagnosed probable MCAS from several years of chronic mold exposure. I’ve lived in older places with minor mold since 2020 and in the first place I just got the usual mold exposure symptoms one would expect including headaches and sinus problems. 

The next year, I tried moving into another newer place only to find within a year that it probably had mold in the walls and the bathroom vent. That year, I developed brain fog and dizziness that I couldn’t get any answers for. I’ve only realized the cause was likely mold recently. 

The year after that, I tried moving into an older house in a totally different area that I had inspected personally for signs of leaks and everything looked shipshape. Until the window sill in the shower grew - you guessed it - green mold. They had bleached it so I wouldn’t see it, but it was still there. I’m still living in this house now and am due to move to a very new apartment with no leaks, no extra moisture, etc in a week. I’m moving early and paying a fortune to get my life back. 

My symptoms started as basic headaches, GI issues, some depression, and fatigue. I’ve gone to develop adrenaline dumps in response to many medications including Benadryl and Flonase as well as Tylenol. On Monday, I tried a new kind of bread and proceeded to spend 2.5 hrs after eating alternating between a pounding heart and adrenaline shakes. This is the first time a food has done this to me, though coffee, wine, and some teas do a more minor version of the same thing.

Yesterday, the day after the big reaction, my knees hurt for several hours which seemed like could be joint pain. That’s a symptom I see a lot of people cite here. I also just had a mini-adrenaline dump and uncomfortable but thankfully short lived stomach pain after trying to eat some leftover Chipotle that was okay for me when it was fresh yesterday. 

So I’m wondering if any of you suffer MCAS this way or if you think I’m barking up the wrong tree? Headed to an allergist for answers soon.",1,1736356521.0,MCAS,1,1.0,False
1hwpcny,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1hwpcny/i_quit_diet_coke_here_are_the_differences_ive/,I quit Diet Coke. Here are the differences I've experienced,"My Diet Coke addiction has waxed and waned throughout my life. I would drink a two-liter a day or more during the worst times. I don't smoke, drink alcohol, or do drugs, so Diet Coke was my one vice that I enjoyed. I decided to drop it to see if there were any positive effects from such a change. 

If you're a Diet Coke drinker, then you probably have been told all your life how bad the stuff is for you. Or read the conflicting research on whether it's carcinogenic or not. Or that it helps with weight control or not. But one thing I haven't seen any research or comments on was Diet Coke's effect on cognition and recall.   
  
I've been ""sober"" for two months now and have noticed an improvement in my memory. In my line of work, I have to remember tiny technical details like strings of digits or proper code syntax. Since I've stopped drinking Diet Coke, I've noticed how easier it is to remember all of this crap. I don't know if other Diet Coke drinkers have had similar symptoms (or if my memory was actually affected by DC or not), but it's a marked change that I wanted to report. 

The other big difference I've found is how much money I've saved. I had no idea that Diet Coke (or other soft drinks) have become so expensive. Intellectually I knew that soft drinks have been affected by inflation just like everything else--but saving around $30 a week just on Diet Coke alone has been surprising. 

But that's pretty much it. I haven't lost or gained any weight since the change, nor has my appetite grown or decreased. I don't feel any better or worse beside the improved memory, but this may have been caused by something else in my life besides me going dry on Diet Coke.

The strategy I used to quit Diet Coke was to drink more coffee (from two cups to four) and drink sparkling water for the carbonation that we all love. Most sparkling water brands are overpriced--but the generic lemon-lime sparkling water that my Publix sells is pretty good. $1.50 per two-liter bottle is a good deal, too.

As we know, POTS has many causes so what works for me might not work for you. 

I had been forcing myself to eat breakfast all my life as I was taught ""it's the most important meal of the day"". 

Last summer I decided to stop forcing myself.  Since then, I have been shifting the times to see when it's best to eat.  

I've found it best to wait until late afternoon. 

I figure that it has to with post-prandial hypotension; though I don't have the data to prove it. 

Generally, I wake up around 9 and start drinking electolytes and coffee (all acetylcholine esterase inhibitors, including caffeine and Mestinon, help me a lot). Sometimes, if I am really hungry, I will have a small salty snack around noon, but no more than a couple hundred calories. I will have Liquid IV that includes sugar.  I don't know why but I am able to handle sugary liquids but not solids. 

I eat a small meal at 4ish, then dinner at 7 with my family. If I want to eat something like cake or muffins, I need to wait till at least 9pm because I know I will need to lie down a few hours later. 

The first couple months I was losing weight - which is not good as I am already thin -- so I now force myself to eat a protien bar or something similar right before bed to get in the calories. My weight has been stable for the last month since I've been doing that.

","Hey, AI explorers!

Ever wish you had a little AI buddy following you around, keeping track of everything so you don’t have to? That’s exactly the problem I set out to solve, and after months of tinkering, I created **MemoMate**—smart glasses and a wearable pin powered by Gemini AI. And let me tell you, it’s like living in the future.

Picture this: You’re in the middle of juggling work, a side project, and figuring out where you left your coffee cup. MemoMate’s been quietly snapping context-aware photos all day (don’t worry, they’re private). You press a button, ask, “Where’s my coffee?” and boom—it whispers, “It’s on the windowsill.” Game. Changer.

The tech behind it is straight-up magic:

* **Gemini’s Contextual Wizardry**: The same AI we geek out about is the brains behind MemoMate. It processes everything—from remembering where I parked my car to whispering my to-do list before I even think to ask.
* **Seamless Hardware**: The glasses and pin look like they came straight out of a sci-fi movie but fit right into your daily life. Bonus points for the bone-conduction speaker—it’s like the AI is sharing secrets with you.
* **Privacy-First (Really)**: Everything runs on-device until you need it synced, so no creepy stuff here.

But the coolest part? It’s like having Gemini as your co-pilot for life. Forget scrambling to recall that random genius idea or missing a reminder to pick up batteries during a grocery run. MemoMate keeps it all together while you keep being awesome.

I built this because I needed it. My ADHD brain was tired of forgetting *everything*. But now I want to share it with my fellow AI geeks. Imagine the conversations you’ll spark: “Oh, this? It’s just my wearable AI assistant. No big deal.”

So here’s my question to you: What else should MemoMate do? How would *you* use Gemini on the go? I’d love to hear your ideas—I’m already dreaming of the possibilities.

Because, let’s be real, we’re living in a world where AI can now *talk to your glasses.* The future is here, and it’s cooler than I ever imagined.

Then, 3-4 months later I was symptomatic again, and my TSH was at 7, so my dose was increased to 50 MCG, and 6 weeks later, my numbers were within a normal range but not the optimal range (TSH 3.6).  

This last increase was in July and now low and behold I seem to be symptomatic again. My T4 has been within range throughout this ordeal but generally on the lower end.  My doctor tested me for antibodies to rule out Hashimoto's during my very first thyroid panel but said levels were low (shouldn't they be 0?). 

Has anyone has been through something similar? I'm wondering if this seemingly quick deterioration of thyroid function is normal or a possible indication that I do have Hashimoto's? I always take my medication at the same time every morning on an empty stomach, I wait 2-3 hours to have my first cup of coffee, and I do not take any supplements or other medications.

Any input would be greatly appreciated!  ",1,1736356140.0,Hypothyroidism,0,1.0,False

I am currently having an argument with my girlfriend of 6 months. For context:

I have several friends who are female. Obviously, I am closer to some than others, but generally, I'd say I have 4 female friends I am really close with and 3 male friends. All of them have been really important to me in the past, going through crises together, vacations, and different phases of my life. They are a very important support network to me, especially because I am not that close with my family. Out of the 4 female friends, 2 are currently in relationships, and the others are not (important for later). There have never been any flings, affairs, or romantic feelings from my side for any of my female friends except for a 'marriage' with one of them in kindergarten when we were 4. 

I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 6 months now, and she has started expressing that she feels uncomfortable with how close I am to my female friends. This argument has been going on for 2 months now. I have tried to convince her that there is nothing to worry about, I want to be in a relationship with her, etc. However, this has not worked. In order for her to feel more comfortable, I have introduced her to all the female friends I am close with, so she gets to know them, also facilitating them being able to talk alone if possible. I have asked her if there were any specific incidents that made her uncomfortable, but apparently, it is the 'concept' of me being so close with female friends.

Yesterday, the argument resurfaced because I asked my girlfriend what time during the weekend would work for her so that I could have a phone call (about 1 hour or so) with one of my friends who lives a bit further away. We again got into an argument. I even went as far as questioning her logic and reminded her that I am bisexual and asked her with whom I am supposed to be friends then. She told me that it was different. At that point, I told her that cutting contact with the close female friends I have is a line I was not willing to cross. I asked her to think about whether there are options for her so that she becomes comfortable with those friendships. I told her I was open to discussing options she would bring up.

After an hour, she came back with the following options:

Cutting contact only with the female friends of mine that are single
Only meeting them with her present and not alone or only meeting them in a group setting, e.g., a coffee shop instead of someone's home
Letting her go through all my chats with them whenever she wants
Note, that all this was supposed to happen cumulatively and not as different alternatives. I told her that I am not willing to go along with that plan. How was the first idea supposed to go? Whenever someone breaks up, they are out, and can call me again when they have a new partner? Also, her going through all my chats every time was not an option. I consider that a massive breach of trust toward my friends, as we have chatted about all sorts of stuff (therapy, mental health, partners, even domestic violence a few years ago). Also, basically making my friends acquaintances that I only see at group gatherings that almost never happen because we all have jobs is not what I consider a good friendship.

I told her that I am willing to let her go through chats with the consent of my friends, leaving out certain parts that they do not feel comfortable sharing. Also, I was willing to meet my friends in coffee shops, parks, and public spaces instead of our homes for the foreseeable future. Though, I told her that I am only willing to do this if there is a realistic chance of her moving toward being comfortable, and that this is not how I usually would like friendships to go.

She told me I do not respect her feeling uncomfortable because I am not willing to go with her options when she already was willing to compromise. I told her that she is entitled to her feelings and that I think it is fine to feel jealousy, but that this is a line I simply cannot cross. She was mad and only partially admitted that it was out of jealousy but also pointed out she considered my friendships 'inappropriate.' She said it was a legitimate expectation to at least 'strongly reduce' those friendships. I tried to tell her again how important these friendships are to me and i would not 'strongly reduce' them. She then stormed off, went home, and is currently not speaking to me. We had made plans for tomorrow, where we will probably have a last talk about this. I fear, we simply do not match because of this, and I am not willing to have people who are so important to me cut out of my life or have those relationships reduced to a degree that is no longer my concept of friendship.

I am, however, now second-guessing myself and questioning whether I am off on this. Is this type if friendship as my gf said ""inappropriate""? Where do i go from here? Have i missed ways i could go to make her feel more comfortable? Am i wrong for not going with her compromise?

tl;dr: i (male) have several female friends that are very important to me. My girlfriend feels uncomfortable with that and even with all my efforts only compromises in relations where i would not actually be friends with them anymore. Where do i go from this / how can i fix this? ",1,1736355779.0,relationships,8,0.6,False
1hwp0qs,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1hwp0qs/will_you_have_a_cup_of_coffee_or_cup_of_tea_is/,"Will you have a cup of coffee or cup of tea? Is the outcome determined? Emergence vs reductionism, a brief meditation","A **naïve determinist** would say that this choice is determined by your **tastes, memories, neurons, brain, its chemistry, its electrical impulses, how your senses react to external stimuli**, and so on.  
As if all of the above were somehow different from.... ***you***.

So yes, the coffee-tea choice is determined and necessarily caused. Determined and caused... by you.   
Which is the same to say: you are free to choose, since you are the primary (and by a large margin) determining factor of the outcome.

That is what, in a nutshell, simple, linear, ""Dennetian"" compatibilism points out.



But that's not what a **more experienced determinist** would answer: ***reductionism enters the game.***  


Everything, they argue, is reducible to an unbroken chain of cause-and-effect: microscopic interactions and movements of the fundamental components of matter, from the origins of time to the present day. Every action, thought, and choice formed in your brain is merely a consequence—an expression, an epiphenomenal representation - of this underlying causal process. Therefore, whatever is happening in your brain cannot, by definition, be free (or self-determining). Not because your conscious self-determination (""the complex, purposeful process happening in your brain which is you"") is cohereced by some other force, but ***because it is not happening as a real, fundamental phenomenon.***

Every thought you have is reducible to a mental state, which is reducible to neurons firing, which are reducible to atoms and particles and fields vibrating, and so on. Each of these 'reductions' exists ""as it is"" in its current state because the conditions and properties of the previous and more fundamental state have caused and determined it. Since there is **an uninterrupted continuum of such purely physical states,** you were not born free, nor did you decide to be free. Even if you **did** decide, at some point, to be free, ""the cause of that decision""—the previous mental state—would itself not be free.

Of course, ***this would be a fallacy in a world where true complexity and real emergence are acknowledged as existent.*** The fact that a property or a phenomena (e.g., life) is formed and sustained by and from non-living continuous processes—without a specific moment where one can say, ""Ah-ha, that's the clear demarcation, the discrete step, the limit, here is life, there is no-life""—*does not mean that a living organism is not truly ""alive"" once formed, and that being alive is a radically different condition than being not alive, and that this condition entails unique faculties and properties*. Similarly, the fact that a slave is freed by their master does not mean the slave is not truly free and able to trul exercise freedom, despite the fact that its freedom was also the wish of the master—another consequence of the master’s coercion.

However, in a fully reductionist framework (no emergence whatsoever), this holds.

The problem is that in this worldview, the very conception of ""self""—as something separate, independent, or different from what is not ""you""—must be recognized as ultimately **epiphenomenal** and illusory too. You are just atoms (by no means different or even particularly separate from the atoms of the environment), temporarily aggregated into a particular structure. Like a chair or a table, your every state and behavior is predetermined by the physical laws that govern your fundamental components and by the initial conditions of the universe.

This line of thinking should lead reductionist determinists to the ultimate conclusion (though they rarely admit it): not only are you not free, but you are not determined either.

You simply **are not.**

Consciousness, the ego, the self, thought, life—all are illusions. There is no need to ""deny"" free will, because in strict reductionist determinism, there is no will at all, nor even a subject that perceives itself as having a will (free or otherwise).",3,1736355721.0,freewill,8,0.71,False

Well eventually that caught up to me during covid and I gained a bunch of weight because I was no longer doing the activities that allowed me to eat without consequences.

I went to the doctor again and was told I must have diabetes because I was fat. They concluded that I didn't  have high blood sugar, as I already told them, and that I should just avoid carbs.

I felt full so it's difficult to make myself eat something but I was getting dizzy. I can't keep doing this. It's bad especially at night. I just feel sick all the time and it makes it much harder to work out.

Just being a total show off like a perfect couple for the world but with endless hours of intellectual jujutsu while snuggling in bed, live critiquing the best Netflix shows, cooking meals together, random late-night bar hopping and walks, reading together entwined like one organism, taboo topping each others imagination. All of that has just... vanished.

I once read somewhere, 'A breakup is like trying to untangle a necklace...except the knot is in your heart, and every time you pull, you find another broken piece of yourself.'

Weird metaphor, but honestly, it kind of feels that way after ending a live-in relationship. It leaves you like Nietzsche is drawing in the black hole. 

I'm 34M whose long term partner suddenly mentioned she doesn't want to have children (after insisting on it it for years) and it ended everything between us. I’m trying to find my footing again, but I didn't realize how much space another person could occupy until it's suddenly empty. The biggest thing that’s left behind isn’t just the emotional stuff, but the time. 

I didn’t realize how much of my day was spent in shared routines until I had to face an entire evening with only my own thoughts. I find myself staring at the walls, thinking about the little things, like who’s going to make coffee in the morning or who I’m going to tell about the weird thing that happened at work today. The weirdest part? It’s not just missing the person, it’s missing the time we spent together, the smell, the movement, the sound of her feet thumping the old wood and the random laughter, like an anchor moving about your ship of life. 

Now the silence in the apartment is like a blank canvas, but I can’t seem to figure out what to fill it with. I don’t know if it’s just the loneliness or the sudden lack of purpose after work, but it feels like there’s a huge gap where I once had a partner. I abhored her texting me at work, today I kept looking at my dead phone, if she messaged, if she messaged, if she messaged. She didn't. Why would she? You kicked her out of the house..

No amount of workouts, walks, meditation, novels, scotch or kink gooning/ masturbation, not even prayers are helpful.

Anyone else been through something like this? How did you start finding your rhythm again after a long-term, live-in relationship ends? Any advice on how to fill that space or even learn how to enjoy the quiet?

Pipe Dream is a mobile van cannabis pipe and bong cleaning service. Jake and Holly are setting up franchising. They have three letters of intent from franchisees and expect to expand to 250 franchisees.

The van has an ultrasound cleaning tank, which gets pipes and bongs cleaner than you can do at home in the sink.

Their competition is DIY alcohol and boiling water in your sink, which is a mess. Or not doing anything. Jake talked about a customer with bronchitis and mold in his bong, whose bronchitis went away when his bong was cleaned.

Legal issues define the parameters of the business. Cannabis dispensaries can’t clean pipes and bongs on site because contraband (dirty pipes) are not allowed in dispensaries (and the small us awful). Customers can’t legally carry a dirty pipe or bong off their property, a van in your driveway solves this problem. Different states have different rules.

There was debate about whether to show revenue per franchisee, cost per cleaning per pipe, cleanings per year per customer, and other details in a six-minute pitch. Bob Goldman said that a six-minute pitch should hook an investor, and then reveal details in a coffee meeting or in the due diligence. Other people wanted to see the details in the pitch.

Jake asked for $250,000. This sounds too small. A bigger ask would look better to investors.

Jake’s presentation was professional but could have been more fun, more like a Grateful Dead show.

Hello so I’ve been facing an issue that’s been bothering me. I have these dark brown almost black stains on my grooves and no they are not cavities (it was checked over and over by different dentists) I don’t know what’s the cause, I’m a daily tea and coffee drinker but it’s literally just on the groves which I don’t understand, are my groves too deep or anfractuous? Is there any way I can get rid of this at all? Been to more than one dentist and they always do a de scaling but it’s always still there, I used whitening toothpaste and hydrogen peroxide for years yet nothing! Someone please help me find a solution or suggest something, if possible an 
explanation of what this is because I can’t find anything and I really want to get rid of this 🙏",1,1736355483.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

1hwovmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1hwovmm/how_to_master_time_blocking_for_maximum/,How to Master Time Blocking for Maximum Productivity,"**Ever feel like your to-do list is out to get you? 🙃**

I swear, sometimes it feels like my tasks multiply like rabbits overnight. Anyone here ever pushed a task to tomorrow, and then suddenly, tomorrow looks like a battlefield? Yeah, been there, done that, got the T-shirt.

Here's the thing: we’re always told to ""work smarter, not harder,"" but what does that even *mean*? Enter: **time blocking**. It's like the Marie Kondo of scheduling—magically putting your day in order and sparking joy along the way.

### Time Blocking 101: A Friend, Not a Foe
For those who are new to this magical method, think of it as making cozy little homes for your tasks throughout your day. Instead of a never-ending list, you get scheduled blocks of time dedicated to each task. It's like giving every to-do on your list a reservation at a fancy restaurant. 🍽️

**Why try time blocking?** 

- **Myth: ""I need motivation to get things done.""** Truth is, motivation is fickle. But when you see a task and know you’ve got an exact window to tackle it, it’s like a gentle nudge from a friend saying, “Hey, you can do this!”

- **Feel-good moment:** Fewer surprises. Your day doesn’t suddenly feel like it’s gone off the rails.

### How It’s Changed My Life
I was once the proud owner of a stress-inducing to-do list the length of my arm. But here’s what happened when I embraced time blocking:

1. **Designated “me time”** - Y’all, breaks are not just for fun. They’re necessary! Time blocking made sure my afternoon coffee and quick TikTok scroll weren't afterthoughts.

2. **No more racing against the clock** - Suddenly, I went from being a time-chaser to a time-whisperer. The clock and I? We're officially BFFs.

3. **Less guilt, more peace** - At the end of the day, leftovers on the to-do list don’t scream “failure”; they calmly shift to tomorrow's blocks.

### Real Talk: How to Start

- **Morning magic:** Dedicate the first 15 minutes of your day to mapping it out. Coffee in one hand, planner in the other. ☕

- **Be flexible:** Life happens! If that virtual meeting runs over, adjust your blocks without self-judgment. 

- **Buffer blocks:** Trust me, you want these. They’re the little cushions for when life throws lemons or limes your way.

Ever found yourself getting lost in the time-blocking sauce and felt like you went too far? That's normal! But give it time; like a new pair of shoes, you need to break it in.

Time blocking might not be the fairy godmother to all your productivity woes, but it's pretty darn close. Anyone else a converted time-blocker or have funny mishaps to share? 

Remember, life’s too short to stress about every minute. Time should be our playmate, not our taskmaster. What are your favorite tricks to making the most of your time? Would love to hear your wins and even your “Oops, I forgot!” moments!",1,1736355385.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Outside of a few coffees when she was in my city, we mostly texted when she was helping me learn the local language, but some after I moved, we started exchanging messages quite frequently (every day or two) and about some quite sensitive or personal things. (I'm happy to be friends, but I also recently developed a crush on her and some of our conversations have been a little bit playful/flirty, which makes things complicated...)

The last time she messaged me, she said she was sick and also quite tired from traveling - she was very far from home over the holidays. A little while afterward, I asked her about her travels, which are probably the *least* personal/sensitive thing we've discussed recently, and she's left me on read for several days now. I want to give her time and space for sure and I'm not worried (although I miss her a lot), but it would be odd if I don't hear back for several days longer given how often we've been in touch.

She is a very relaxed person and unlikely to take offense to anything - normally I would just ask if everything was alright, but I've already overthought things with her in the past and I don't want to come across as expecting her to always respond quickly. If I should ask at all, is there a nice way to phrase it, or should I just leave things be until something happens from her side?

P.S.: she speaks perfectly good English, but she enjoys it a lot more when I speak her language - I will thus translate any good suggestions into that language (my third) and my command of it is barely conversational, so simplicity is best :)

P.P.S: she hasn't seen any of my posts/stories on social media (she often likes them when she does) and hasn't posted anything herself for the last couple days (although that's not abnormal by itself).",1,1736355252.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1hwot59,https://www.reddit.com/r/hospice/comments/1hwot59/terminal_lucidity/,Terminal Lucidity,"My dad passed away in 2022, terminal cancer. He refused to go on hospice care until a few weeks before passing; even then, he refused to leave his home until 2 days before passing. 

His last few weeks he was much weaker than usual, but he was still getting up to do things. He would get up to go pee, retrieve things… he even attempted to cook for me as he had a pot of food on the stove when I went to visit him one time.  

2-3 days before he passed , he had an episode in his house in the middle of the night where he was alone at the time. I’m still curious about what happened. My brothers found him the next morning… he was naked curled up in a ball on his couch, there were papers and stuff abnormally strewn about everywhere, and his coffee table was flipped upside down… and it wasn’t a cheap particle board kind of coffee table. It was solid wood, maybe 4 feet by four feet, had a bottom shelf, and probably about 50ish pounds. It just seemed in his state in those last few days, he definitely shouldn’t have had the strength to do whatever transpired that night. My brothers said it looked like a war zone. 

Could he have experienced an episode of terminal lucidity? Any other thoughts of what could have happened? FWIW, he was pissed off that he was dying. Seeing him and his house like that wasn’t too shocking considering how he felt. But given he was so weak in those last few days, it definitely seemed like something was amiss.",2,1736355219.0,hospice,0,1.0,False

I won’t say where I work, because I don’t want to lose my job. Dom, one of the guys in HR, was acting strangely. He was usually a fairly happy person so it came out of nowhere when he threw himself off the top of the building.

People brushed it off, because that's how people cope I guess. He was a major Democrat, super outspoken. Rumor went around that he’d been depressed ever since the election. Seemed a little extreme to me.

Susan was next. She didn’t come into work. They found her hanging from an extension cord in her garage later that afternoon. That same day, another guy from HR drove his Tesla into a brick wall going over a hundred. Needless to say, people in the office were a little on edge.

In a week, seven people from the office took their own lives, and this week it’s been six more. Thirteen. 

I’ve always been a superstitious person. Part of me didn’t want to go to work, but the logical part of me said it didn’t matter. All but two of them died at home. And it’s not like I could just quit.

Everyone was walking around like zombies, wondering if we were exposed to something. Wondering if there was something in the water. Nobody wanted to make coffee. Everybody brought drinks and water from home.

I never drank any coffee from the office anyway. The pot was never really cleaned. I didn’t even use the bathrooms. Public restrooms scare the shit out of me. Germs. Disease. Anyway.

Yesterday, I had to break that rule of mine. I had to use the bathroom. Dinner the night before hadn’t agreed with me all night, and it was still punishing me the next morning.

I stared at that toilet for five minutes, psyching myself up to sit on it. I’d already covered the thing in two layers of paper squares. Hovering was not going to be an option, this was going to be a movement that required a tight seal.

I saw something inside under the rim. It looked like a rubber band. It was moving. The urge to poop was gone. I walked out of the bathroom and grabbed a pen off of the nearest desk.

I went back inside the stall, and scraped along the bottom of the rim. Several long thin pink things fell into the water. Some of them squirmed in the bowl, while others darted back up under the rim and disappeared from view.

They’ve been found in every toilet of the building and the same for the building next to ours.

Experts came in. They’re some kind of parasite. They’ve never seen worms that move so quickly. Apparently they’ve been squeezing inside of people as they sit on the toilet. They’re so fast, no one even feels it. They found several growing inside of Dom during his autopsy.

They were feeding on his brain.

* I can write anywhere from advanced literate to novella style
* I write a minimum of 3 paragraphs per response, I can write upwards of 6 to 12 paragraphs if things really get going and I am fully invested in the scene. That’s between around 500-3000 words.
* I prefer to do doubles. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea but it keeps things fair when doing OCxCanon. This is a personal preference for myself. If you want CanonxCanon or OCxOC for your side I am more than happy to do so but I will not do just one rp of OCxCanon.

Let me break it down in the most relatable way that I like:

**One Shot Learning** – It’s like showing up for an open book test. The teacher says, ""Here’s all the info you might need, but don’t expect the answers to just pop out!"" You rely on your past subject knowledge and a bit of creativity to connect the dots. It's fast, efficient, and perfect for the last-minute gang. AI does the same—uses minimal data, applies pre-learned context, and BOOM, spits out predictions.

**Model Training** – Ah, this is the classic test prep grind. You study all semester, sacrificing Netflix marathons and coffee budgets to deeply understand the subject. By the time exam day comes, you’re the encyclopedia of knowledge. Similarly, AI models spend weeks (or months) ingesting massive amounts of data to be ready for any scenario. 

**Takeaway:** Open book or not, the key is using the right strategy at the right time. Sometimes you need the agility of one-shot learning; other times, the robustness of traditional training wins the day.

Hi so I live with my in laws and have a full time job. My mil does not really work and is home allll day. She will wait until I get home to start cooking so I can help her- she does nothing on her own she won’t even unload a dishwasher until someone comes home so either they do it or someone helps her do it. When I come home from work I love to do a quick workout to get it out of the way- it’s important for me and my me time. I know she hates it but idc. So I’m down with my workout and shower and get downstairs and she goes- “you really need to start helping with the food because I don’t want to stress myself out” and I just stood there like did I hear that right? Stress out? From what? Waking up at 10am having your coffee and sitting and watching tv all day? The only productive thing shell do weekday is maybe a quick mop and vacuum and I’ll do all the other cleanings on the weekends. Am I wrong for at least wanting her to cook just one meal since me and my husband are working all day? It bothers me because if it was the other way around- she would be furious if this was done to her. I don’t mind cooking- I’d prefer it actually but I also don’t like being micromanaged which is what she does whenever I attempt something on my own which is why I just hav stopped.

1hwogvw,https://v.redd.it/cjfegur4tsbe1,"Follow-Up on My Espresso Journey, Improvements!! [Breville Bambino Plus + DF54]","Hey everyone,

Thanks so much for your suggestions on my last post! I’ve been experimenting based on your advice and wanted to share the results.

Here’s what I did differently:

	•	Grind Size: Adjusted to 7 (previously was at 5).

	•	WDT: Took my time with it to ensure even grounds.

	•	Tamping: Tamped twice, then added a twist.

	•	Shot Parameters: Achieved 37g out in 30 seconds.


The results:
The coffee came out better than before, but it still has a slight acidity I’m not a fan of. The texture is also a bit watery, and the overall density feels thin. I’d rate this shot a 7/10—a definite improvement, but there’s still room to grow.

Next steps:
	•	I’m going to try a different type of beans to see if that helps balance the flavor

	•	Planning to introduce a puck screen, as the puck after extraction is quite wet and watery


Appreciate all the help so far, and I’m open to any other tips or suggestions to take this to the next level!",1,1736354429.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I use stevia or monkfruit as a sweetener, so those won't break my fast from what I have read.  But there are still mornings where I just want coffee.  Are there any cream/milk substitutes that are keto and won't break my fast?  I have heard that MCT oil makes coffee ""creamy"" (which is what I'm looking for).

1hwo9fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bahrain/comments/1hwo9fl/the_9010_principle_for_the_grumpy_ones/,The 90/10 Principle for the grumpy ones,"Consider a situation: You're eating breakfast with your family. Your daughter accidentally knocks over a cup of coffee onto your shirt. You curse and harshly scold your daughter for the mishap. She breaks down in tears.

After scolding her, you turn to your wife and criticize her for placing the cup too close to the edge of the table. A short verbal argument follows. You storm upstairs and change your shirt. Back downstairs, you find your daughter has been too busy crying to finish breakfast and get ready for school. She misses the bus. Your wife must leave immediately for work. You rush to the car and drive your daughter to school. Because you are late, you drive 80 km an hour in a 60 km/h speed limit zone. After a 15-minute delay and paying a $60 traffic fine, you arrive at school. Your daughter runs to the building without saying goodbye.

After arriving at the office 30 minutes late, you find you forgot your briefcase. Your day has started terribly, and as it continues, it seems to get worse and worse. You look forward to going home. When you arrive home, you find a small wedge in your relationship with your wife and daughter. Why? Because of how you reacted in the morning.

Why did you have a bad day?
A) Did the coffee cause it?
B)Did your daughter cause it?
C) Did the traffic policeman cause it?
D) Did you cause it?

The answer is D.

You had no control over what happened with the coffee. How you reacted in those 5 seconds is what caused your bad day. Here is what could have and should have happened:

Coffee splashes over you. Your daughter is about to cry. You gently say, ""It's OK honey, you just need to be more careful next time."" Grabbing a towel, you rush upstairs, change your shirt, and grab your briefcase. You come back down in time to look through the window and see your child getting on the bus. She turns and waves. You and your wife kiss before you both go to work. You arrive 5 minutes early and cheerfully greet the staff. Your boss comments on how good a day you are having.

Notice the difference. Two different scenarios. Both started the same but ended differently. Why? Because of how you REACTED. You really do not have any control over 10% of what happens. The other 90% is determined by your reaction.

Here are some ways to apply the 90/10 secret:

If someone says something negative about you, do not be a sponge. Let the attack roll off like water on glass. You don't have to let the negative comment affect you! React properly, and it will not ruin your day. A wrong reaction could result in losing a friend, being fired, getting stressed out, etc.

How do you react if someone cuts you off in traffic? Do you lose your temper? Pound the steering wheel? Curse? Does your blood pressure skyrocket? Do you try and bump them? WHO CARES if you arrive ten seconds later at work? Why let the blue car ruin your drive?

Remember the 90/10 principle, and do not worry about it! If you are told you lost your job, why lose sleep or get irritated? It will work out. Channel your energy and time into finding another job. If the plane is late, and it is going to mangle your schedule for the day, why vent your frustration on the flight attendant? She has no control over what is going on. Use your time to read, get to know the other passengers, etc. Why get stressed out? It will just make things worse. Now you know the 90/10 secret. Apply it, and you will be amazed at the results.",6,1736353925.0,Bahrain,2,0.75,False

","Hi everyone!

First of all, a big thank you to everyone in this community for making it such a great space to learn about pour-over coffee. I’m thrilled to be here and excited to dive into the world of manual brewing. 😊

I’ve recently gotten some new gear, and while I’ve done a fair amount of research (James Hoffmann’s videos, online forums, etc.), I’ve found that every guide seems to say something a bit different. That’s why I’d love to hear directly from you—people with real-world experience—to help me get started on the right foot.

# My Gear:

* **Timemore C3 Pro Grinder**
* **Origami Dripper**
* **ORIGAMI Paper Filters** (cone shaped)
* **Kalita Wave/Flower Filters**
* **Timemore Black Mirror Basic 2 (scale)**
* **Brita Marella for water filtration**
* **pour over kettle with gooseneck - non electric**
* **cheap kettle to boil a water to \~100 °C and then pour it to gooseneck kettle**

# My Coffees:

I have these two coffees at home to experiment with (apologies for possible translation errors, as the original site is in Slovakian):

1. [Colombia Monteblanco Pink Bourbon](https://triplefivecoffee-com.translate.goog/product/colombia-monteblanco-pink-bourbon-250gr-filter/?_x_tr_sl=sk&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sk&_x_tr_pto=wapp)
2. [Kavoholik Exclusive Christmas Set (9x60g light roasts)](https://kavoholik-sk.translate.goog/to-najlepsie-na-filter/1111-kavoholik-exclusive-christmas-vianocny-set-9x60g-svetlo-prazenych-kav.html?_x_tr_sl=sk&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sk&_x_tr_pto=wapp)

# My Questions:

1. **Grind Settings for Timemore C3 Pro**
   * I’ve seen recommendations for V60/Origami ranging from **11–18 clicks** to **20–24 clicks**. Which range should I start with? How should I adjust for different coffees?
2. **Origami Dripper Recipe & Ratio**
   * What’s a good starting point for coffee-to-water ratio? (I’ve seen 1:15 to 1:17 mentioned.)
   * How should I approach my pouring technique with the Origami dripper and these filters?
3. **Best Practices for Beginners**
   * What are the most common mistakes I should avoid as a beginner?
   * Any tips for brewing with lighter roast coffees, like the ones I have?
4. **Which filter should I prefer?**
   * Since I’m using an Origami dripper, should I opt for a wave-style filter or a cone-shaped filter? Which one would provide better results, and does it depend on the type of coffee or brewing method?

I know that a big part of the journey is experimenting—trying different grind sizes, ratios, pouring techniques, and learning from the results. But I also believe that guidance from experienced brewers can help me avoid a lot of the early pitfalls.

I’m eager to learn and would be incredibly grateful for any advice, step-by-step tutorials, or even general tips that you’re willing to share. I can’t wait to brew my first cup tomorrow morning and start this amazing journey with all of you!

Thanks in advance for your help—looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

**TL;DR:** New to pour-over coffee, got some awesome gear (Origami dripper, Timemore C3 Pro), and light roast beans. Looking for advice on grind settings, recipe ratios, and best practices for a beginner. Let’s brew! ☕️",2,1736353747.0,pourover,6,1.0,False

Clara could barely contain her excitement as she walked through the makeshift hallways. The beige tarp walls pressed against the tent's metal frame from the disturbance of the air as she moved at a clipped pace down the corridor. She looked up from the notes in her hand to open the plastic door leading to another long hallway. The airflow tussled her auburn hair about as she walked. She gently put her hair back in place as she returned her attention to her notes. The screen scrolled the text at a slow pace while she followed the handwritten signs to the ""Clean Room.""

It had been years since the discovery of an advanced society. Even longer since the discovery of a psionic capable civilization.  Over her eight centuries of service, Clara was present for each first contact events. She enjoyed interstellar recognition as the premier expert on psionics.

She also held the distinction of being the only cyborg on staff for the Human Collective. The experimental procedures to enhance her cognitive abilities had gone well, some would say perfect even. But no one else could master the proper technique of uploading memory and consciousness into an electronic host. The technique used on Clara was lost when she uploaded herself into a cybernetic brain she developed. Some scientists still suggested she was keeping the secret of her method, calling her amnesia a ploy to be unique. Her organic body had lasted 96 years, while her cyborg body was running perfectly fine after several centuries of use.

She reached the end of the corridor and found a solid steel blast door separating her from the clean room. She closed her eyes and disengaged her link to the Human Collective's networks. The last of the data from the satellites flowed through her head. Clara was glad for the moment of privacy as she felt her excitement rising. There was something to discovering a brand new civilization that Clara really enjoyed, the crossing of boundaries not yet explored. Crossing that threshold had yielded her inorganic body. It led her to a long life of scientific discovery.

She opened her eyes and placed her hand on the scanner directly to the left of the blast door. She had to crane her neck a tiny bit to reach the optic scanner. The door's light flashed a soft green glow as the scanners chimed approval for Clara's entrance. The door opened to a small entryway with another thick blast door directly ahead of her. She took a few steps into the clean room, taking note of the various nozzles affixed to the wall and ceiling. She walked to line herself up with them as the door closed behind her.

Clara chuckled as the soft gray mist spraying from the nozzle tickled her sensors. Once the decontamination protocol finished the blast doors ahead opened for Clara. She took tentative steps into the rocky cavern. Her optic scanners spotted two deceased scientists splayed across the cavern, unfortunate victims of the artifact that lay on a carved stone table near the back of the gloomy chamber. A security officer lay steps from the door, an inconvenience on her way to the table. Their skulls had exploded, leaving a grizzly mess of bone and brain matter strewn through the room. Her optics switched to a high definition camera so she could take notes for her report later. She leaned in to take a close up shot of the body closest to her when she abruptly stopped, hovering less than a meter away from the split skull. She studied the spray pattern and the way the skull had burst, hoping to find a reason for the carnage. More questions began to arise as her scanners noted the unusual volume of brain matter, even for the three combined humans laying around her. She saved the visual evidence in her memory banks as she worked out this new puzzle.

Clara turned her attention to the diamond shaped artifact that lay on the stone table, emitting a low hum that was almost imperceptible. It was not a large object, only the length of Clara's slender hand. She let her fingers hover above the metallic black object for a few seconds. Protocol kept her from touching it immediately. She knew she would be fine interacting with the object. Her inorganic brain could handle the psionic onslaught that doomed the other three in the room. Curiosity got the best of Clara as she cautiously wrapped her fingers around the artifact and lifted it from the table.

She hurried to shut her hearing instruments off as she heard a high pitched squeal beginning to come from the artifact. The vibrations from the sound made the whole artifact shudder. Clara grit her teeth as the tone began to reverberate in her head. The speed and intensity increased causing Clara to reach for the stone table to steady herself. Even with her hearing instruments turned off Clara felt like her head was going to split.

She had been right to be cautious with the artifact. After a few seconds of the tone's assault the ringing began to subside. When Clara felt the faintest of tremors coming from the artifact she reactivated her hearing instruments. The residual sound waves bouncing throughout the room made eerie ringing noises as the waves caught stray pieces of metal. She shuddered as the waves found the right frequency to vibrate within her metallic body. Clara refocused her attention on the artifact in enough time to watch it begin to spray a fine mist.

Clara shut off her breathing apparatus and switched her oxygen intake over to her internal supply. She let her fingers brush through the mist as it's spray dissipated, sensors ran a quick test of the samples beading on her metallic fingers. She gave her wrist a quick flick and watched as the droplets of liquid arced toward the floor. The test had shown traces psilocybin in its composition. Clara was grateful her nonporous skin kept her from absorbing the psychoactive solution.

Its defenses exhausted, the diamond shaped artifact offered no resistance as Clara inspected the relic. Her fingers grazed over the smooth metallic surface of the artifact. Looking closely, she saw a grid lightly etched into the surface of the artifact only visible at certain angles in the light. Symbols were in the center of each full square on the grid. She was excited to begin work deciphering the many symbols scrawling across the diamond's reflective surface. Clara marveled at the beauty of this magnificent relic.

Enveloped in the smugness of success, Clara let one of her long metallic finger fall against the metallic artifact harder than she meant to. The contact between the two metals caused the artifact to produce a sudden peal. The tone became louder and caused vibrations to begin emanating from the diamond. She soon realized the folly of her mistake as the ringing  reverberated from within the artifact and against the metal of her body. The vibrations resonated within her metallic body, producing the perfect frequency to overload her various sensors. Even as Clara tried to initiate counter measures, the unconscious part of her brain began to run a system reboot. The vibrations running through her body confused too many of her sensors for Clara to abort the emergency restart protocol. Her eyes began to close as her consciousness was disconnected from her optical relay.

Clara opened her eyes and found herself in an office that smelled of old books and freshly brewed coffee. She slammed her hand against the solid wood desk as she cursed her unfortunate predicament. She underestimated the relic's previous owner and now found herself inconvenienced in the solitary prison of her Central Consciousness Unit.

As she fumed over her situation she glanced to her watch to see how long her reboot would take. The clock face showed a cool minimalist display, the countdown was just under ten minutes. Clara cursed again and made note of the frequency of the vibrations she had been subjected to, certain she would never fall prey to that trick again. With the time it would take for her sensor array to come back online she considered the species responsible for locking her inside her own mind. She pulled up photos from her memory banks from the room her physical body was still in, pouring through the images to see what she could learn about the mysterious species. It had been awhile since she felt challenged by a particular subject. This species would be interesting to study.",2,1736353692.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1hwo4hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeethWhiteningHelp/comments/1hwo4hb/what_is_the_best_professional_teeth_whitening/,"What is the Best Professional Teeth Whitening: Costs, Benefits, and Results","# What is Professional Teeth Whitening?

Professional teeth whitening is a dental procedure performed by a dentist or dental hygienist that uses stronger whitening agents than those found in over-the-counter products. These treatments typically use hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide as the active ingredients, which effectively break down stains and discoloration on the enamel.

Professional whitening can be done in-office or through at-home treatments provided by your dentist. In-office treatments are generally quicker and more powerful, offering immediate results, while at-home treatments are customized to your needs and offer gradual whitening.

# Types of Professional Teeth Whitening Treatments

1. **In-Office Whitening**
   * In-office whitening treatments, like **Zoom Whitening** or **Opalescence Boost**, are the fastest and most effective way to achieve a brighter smile. The process typically takes about an hour and involves applying a whitening gel to your teeth, activated by a special light or laser. These treatments are ideal for those who want immediate results.
2. **Take-Home Whitening Kits**
   * Your dentist may also provide custom take-home whitening kits that contain a more concentrated whitening solution than over-the-counter products. These kits typically include custom-fitted trays that ensure even application of the gel. While the process takes longer (usually over a few weeks), take-home kits can provide noticeable results and are more convenient.
3. **Laser Teeth Whitening**
   * Laser whitening is another in-office option where a laser is used to activate the whitening gel, speeding up the whitening process. This method is highly effective for stubborn stains but tends to be more expensive than traditional in-office treatments.

# Costs of Professional Teeth Whitening

The cost of professional teeth whitening varies depending on the method you choose, the location of your dentist, and the severity of your stains. Here's a breakdown of typical costs:

* **In-Office Whitening**:
   * Prices generally range from **$500 to $1,000** for a single session. In-office treatments are more expensive because they involve specialized equipment and a professional application process.
* **Take-Home Kits**:
   * Professional take-home whitening kits usually cost between **$200 and $400**. This price typically includes custom trays and professional-strength whitening gel, but it can vary based on the brand and the dentist's pricing.
* **Laser Whitening**:
   * Laser whitening tends to be the priciest option, with costs ranging from **$1,000 to $3,000** per session. This method is often used for individuals with severe staining or those seeking quicker results.

**Note**: Many dental offices offer payment plans or package deals for multiple treatments, so it’s a good idea to inquire about financing options.

# Benefits of Professional Teeth Whitening

1. **Quick Results**
   * One of the main advantages of professional teeth whitening is that you can see noticeable results in just one session, especially with in-office treatments. This makes it a great option if you have an upcoming event or just want instant results.
2. **Long-Lasting Effects**
   * Professional whitening results typically last longer than over-the-counter products. With proper maintenance, including avoiding stain-causing foods and drinks and practicing good oral hygiene, your results can last up to one to three years.
3. **Customized Treatment**
   * Your dentist will assess your oral health and customize the whitening treatment based on your needs. Whether you have sensitive teeth, yellowing, or stubborn stains, professional treatments can be tailored to ensure the best outcome.
4. **Safe and Controlled**
   * Professional whitening treatments are safer and more controlled than at-home alternatives. Your dentist will ensure that the whitening agents are applied correctly, minimizing the risk of gum irritation or tooth sensitivity.
5. **Effectiveness for Stubborn Stains**
   * Professional treatments are highly effective for a wide range of stains, including those caused by aging, food, beverages (such as coffee and wine), and tobacco. If you’ve tried over-the-counter products without success, professional whitening can provide the results you’ve been looking for.

# Expected Results of Professional Teeth Whitening

The results of professional teeth whitening can vary depending on the method and your teeth’s current condition. However, most people can expect their teeth to be several shades lighter after the treatment.

* **In-Office Whitening**:
   * After an in-office treatment, you can expect your teeth to appear up to **8 shades lighter**, depending on the type of stains and the strength of the whitening treatment.
* **Take-Home Whitening Kits**:
   * Results from take-home kits typically show after **1-2 weeks** of use, with teeth becoming up to **5-7 shades lighter**. This process is gradual, but the results are still significant.
* **Laser Whitening**:
   * Laser whitening can deliver immediate and dramatic results, often brightening your teeth by up to **10 shades** in just one session. However, because of the intensity of the treatment, some individuals may experience temporary sensitivity.

# Side Effects of Professional Teeth Whitening

While professional whitening treatments are generally safe, some individuals may experience temporary side effects such as:

* **Tooth Sensitivity**:
   * Some people experience increased tooth sensitivity during or after the treatment. This usually subsides within a few days.
* **Gum Irritation**:
   * If the whitening gel comes into contact with the gums, it may cause mild irritation. Dentists take precautions to minimize this risk.

To reduce sensitivity, many dental offices offer desensitizing treatments that can be applied before or after the whitening procedure.

# How to Maintain Your Bright Smile

To extend the results of your professional whitening treatment, follow these tips:

1. **Practice Good Oral Hygiene**:
   * Brush and floss regularly to prevent new stains from forming. Use a whitening toothpaste to help maintain your results.
2. **Avoid Stain-Causing Foods and Drinks**:
   * Limit your intake of coffee, tea, red wine, and tobacco, as these can stain your teeth over time.
3. **Regular Touch-Ups**:
   * Consider touch-up treatments every 6-12 months to maintain a bright smile, especially if you consume foods or drinks that can stain your teeth.",1,1736353592.0,TeethWhiteningHelp,0,1.0,False

(Skip to **** for main point)

I work for a pretty well established architecture firm. We do projects all over the world from hospitals to houses to warehouses. My company employs about 35 people. This just to give you some insight. 

In terms of a working environment the company provides: 
Tea 
Ricoffee (veery cheap instant coffee)
Sugar 
Milk

There are about 5 teaspoons (not over exagerating) and everyone has their own mug (no ""generic/communal"" mugs etc.) 

*****

Today we got an email entitled ""Appropriate use of Company Milk"" 
In this email we were chastised for using the Milk provided by the company for things like cereal. The milk is only to be used for tea or coffee. 

Now obviously a bowl of cereal uses more milk than a cup of coffee and if someone has cereal every morning they're going to use a lot of milk... and simply having the company provide milk is a privilege... but in this day and age employee well being is a real thing that everyone knows about...

I mean?????

Really. We're all adults! No one is eating a giant bowl of cereal everyday of the week. We all know it is a shared commodity and we're all considerate. They don't even give us salt and pepper. There's a super expensive coffee machine (for clients only) which we're not allowed to use and we don't even get napkins? 

I think it's ridiculous. It's short sited and just shows that they have 0 regard for our well being or employee satisfaction.  

This is just one incident like this, there are much more. 

I suppose this was more of a rant but any advice or clarity or context to their decisions would be greatly appreciated

She looked up from the notes in her hand to open the plastic door leading to another long hallway. The airflow tussled her auburn hair about as she walked. She gently put her hair back in place as she returned her attention to her notes. The screen scrolled the text at a slow pace while she followed the handwritten signs to the ""Clean Room.""

It had been years since the discovery of an advanced society. Even longer since the discovery of a psionic capable civilization.  Over her eight centuries of service, Clara was present for each first contact events. She enjoyed interstellar recognition as the premier expert on psionics.

She also held the distinction of being the only cyborg on staff for the Human Collective. The experimental procedures to enhance her cognitive abilities had gone well, some would say perfect even. But no one else could master the proper technique of uploading memory and consciousness into an electronic host. The technique used on Clara was lost when she uploaded herself into a cybernetic brain she developed. Some scientists still suggested she was keeping the secret of her method, calling her amnesia a ploy to be unique. Her organic body had lasted 96 years, while her cyborg body was running perfectly fine after several centuries of use.

She reached the end of the corridor and found a solid steel blast door separating her from the clean room. She closed her eyes and disengaged her link to the Human Collective's networks. The last of the data from the satellites flowed through her head. Clara was glad for the moment of privacy as she felt her excitement rising. There was something to discovering a brand new civilization that Clara really enjoyed, the crossing of boundaries not yet explored. Crossing that threshold had yielded her inorganic body. It led her to a long life of scientific discovery.

She opened her eyes and placed her hand on the scanner directly to the left of the blast door. She had to crane her neck a tiny bit to reach the optic scanner. The door's light flashed a soft green glow as the scanners chimed approval for Clara's entrance. The door opened to a small entryway with another thick blast door directly ahead of her. She took a few steps into the clean room, taking note of the various nozzles affixed to the wall and ceiling. She walked to line herself up with them as the door closed behind her.

Clara chuckled as the soft gray mist spraying from the nozzle tickled her sensors. Once the decontamination protocol finished the blast doors ahead opened for Clara. She took tentative steps into the rocky cavern. Her optic scanners spotted two deceased scientists splayed across the cavern, unfortunate victims of the artifact that lay on a carved stone table near the back of the gloomy chamber. A security officer lay steps from the door, an inconvenience on her way to the table. Their skulls had exploded, leaving a grizzly mess of bone and brain matter strewn through the room. Her optics switched to a high definition camera so she could take notes for her report later. She leaned in to take a close up shot of the body closest to her when she abruptly stopped, hovering less than a meter away from the split skull. She studied the spray pattern and the way the skull had burst, hoping to find a reason for the carnage. More questions began to arise as her scanners noted the unusual volume of brain matter, even for the three combined humans laying around her. She saved the visual evidence in her memory banks as she worked out this new puzzle.

Clara turned her attention to the diamond shaped artifact that lay on the stone table, emitting a low hum that was almost imperceptible. It was not a large object, only the length of Clara's slender hand. She let her fingers hover above the metallic black object for a few seconds. Protocol kept her from touching it immediately. She knew she would be fine interacting with the object. Her inorganic brain could handle the psionic onslaught that doomed the other three in the room. Curiosity got the best of Clara as she cautiously wrapped her fingers around the artifact and lifted it from the table.

She hurried to shut her hearing instruments off as she heard a high pitched squeal beginning to come from the artifact. The vibrations from the sound made the whole artifact shudder. Clara grit her teeth as the tone began to reverberate in her head. The speed and intensity increased causing Clara to reach for the stone table to steady herself. Even with her hearing instruments turned off Clara felt like her head was going to split.

She had been right to be cautious with the artifact. After a few seconds of the tone's assault the ringing began to subside. When Clara felt the faintest of tremors coming from the artifact she reactivated her hearing instruments. The residual sound waves bouncing throughout the room made eerie ringing noises as the waves caught stray pieces of metal. She shuddered as the waves found the right frequency to vibrate within her metallic body. Clara refocused her attention on the artifact in enough time to watch it begin to spray a fine mist.

Clara shut off her breathing apparatus and switched her oxygen intake over to her internal supply. She let her fingers brush through the mist as it's spray dissipated, sensors ran a quick test of the samples beading on her metallic fingers. She gave her wrist a quick flick and watched as the droplets of liquid arced toward the floor. The test had shown traces psilocybin in its composition. Clara was grateful her nonporous skin kept her from absorbing the psychoactive solution.

Its defenses exhausted, the diamond shaped artifact offered no resistance as Clara inspected the relic. Her fingers grazed over the smooth metallic surface of the artifact. Looking closely, she saw a grid lightly etched into the surface of the artifact only visible at certain angles in the light. Symbols were in the center of each full square on the grid. She was excited to begin work deciphering the many symbols scrawling across the diamond's reflective surface. Clara marveled at the beauty of this magnificent relic.

Enveloped in the smugness of success, Clara let one of her long metallic finger fall against the metallic artifact harder than she meant to. The contact between the two metals caused the artifact to produce a sudden peal. The tone became louder and caused vibrations to begin emanating from the diamond. She soon realized the folly of her mistake as the ringing  reverberated from within the artifact and against the metal of her body. The vibrations resonated within her metallic body, producing the perfect frequency to overload her various sensors. Even as Clara tried to initiate counter measures, the unconscious part of her brain began to run a system reboot. The vibrations running through her body confused too many of her sensors for Clara to abort the emergency restart protocol. Her eyes began to close as her consciousness was disconnected from her optical relay.

Clara opened her eyes and found herself in an office that smelled of old books and freshly brewed coffee. She slammed her hand against the solid wood desk as she cursed her unfortunate predicament. She underestimated the relic's previous owner and now found herself inconvenienced in the solitary prison of her Central Consciousness Unit.

As she fumed over her situation she glanced to her watch to see how long her reboot would take. The clock face showed a cool minimalist display, the countdown was just under ten minutes. Clara cursed again and made note of the frequency of the vibrations she had been subjected to, certain she would never fall prey to that trick again. With the time it would take for her sensor array to come back online she considered the species responsible for locking her inside her own mind. She pulled up photos from her memory banks from the room her physical body was still in, pouring through the images to see what she could learn about the mysterious species.

I’m very disciplined with my vices. 

2 pouches a day never caused me any issues. Until October 2023, when I started getting a tightness/pressue feeling in my chest. It was very uncomfortable and was triggered by a variety of things. Zyns, Marijuana, caffeine, large meals.

I spent months thinking it was my heart. Went to a cardiologist, got tons of tests done. EKGs, bloodwork, a heart monitor. Nothing was wrong with my heart. Cardiologist said it could be my esophagus.

Went to a gastroenterologist, got an endoscopy. They said it looked like there was some minor acid reflux damage. Prescribed acid reflux meds, didn’t help. Prescribed two other acid reflux meds, didn’t help. The symptom doesn’t feel like acid reflux. It doesn’t burn. It’s a pressure. Feels like it’s in an artery. 

I started thinking maybe it was my mild zyn habit causing me issues. So I quit them on Nov. 5 2024.

It wasn’t hard. Barely even craved them. No withdrawal or anything. But two fucking months go by, and I still have this tightness, pressure in my chest. I feel it every day. It has not improved at all.

So I started taking my two pouches a day again. There is no point in quitting these if quitting them doesn’t make me feel any better!

I also tried quitting coffee, tried quitting weed, for a month each, didn’t help. 

And yet, I read through this sub, and see tons of people reporting issues with their GI tracts and stomachs and esophagus. And they say quitting makes all their problems go away. 

I’d never touch zyns again if they are actually causing this problem. But I’d expect to see some kind of improvement in 2 months if they were causing the issue… Did I not quit for long enough?

In a world where everyone carries their own struggles, showing empathy can create meaningful connections and a culture of support. Here are 20 ways to demonstrate empathy and support to those around you:

1. **Listen Actively**: Give your full attention when someone is speaking, showing that their words matter.

2. **Validate Feelings**: Acknowledge and accept others' emotions without judgment, letting them know it’s okay to feel how they do.

3. **Offer Help**: Ask how you can assist someone, whether it’s with a task or emotional support.

4. **Check In**: Send a text or call to see how someone is doing, especially if you know they’re going through a tough time.

5. **Share Your Own Experience**: Relate to their situation by sharing a similar personal experience, showing that they're not alone.

6. **Encourage Expression**: Create a safe space for others to express their emotions without fear of criticism.

7. **Be Patient**: Understand that healing or coping takes time; allow them to progress at their own pace.

8. **Show Appreciation**: Regularly express gratitude for the people in your life, acknowledging their efforts and presence.

9. **Be Present**: Sometimes just being there, even in silence, can provide comfort.

10. **Use Positive Affirmations**: Remind someone of their strengths and abilities, especially when they’re feeling low.

11. **Respect Boundaries**: Understand when someone needs space, and let them know you’re there when they’re ready.

12. **Engage in Acts of Kindness**: Small gestures, like bringing coffee, can brighten someone’s day.

13. **Be Nonjudgmental**: Approach conversations with an open mind, free from criticism.

14. **Encourage Self-Care**: Suggest activities that promote well-being, like taking a walk or practicing mindfulness.

15. **Provide Resources**: Share helpful articles, books, or local services that might aid their journey.

16. **Support Their Goals**: Celebrate their accomplishments, no matter how small, and encourage their aspirations.

17. **Offer Companionship**: Invite them to spend time together, whether it’s doing an activity they enjoy or just hanging out.

18. **Practice Forgiveness**: Address conflicts with understanding and a willingness to forgive, fostering deeper connections.

19. **Be Mindful of Your Words**: Choose language that is supportive and kind, avoiding criticism or blame.

20. **Remain Open**: Be willing to have difficult conversations, knowing that vulnerability can strengthen relationships.

👉 Remember, empathy is about connection and understanding. Your small actions can have a profound impact on someone’s life. Let’s cultivate a supportive community together! 💖

In particular, I am worried about getting too technical on the underlying physics and overdoing the science puns to the point of distracting from the core romance, thank you!

\*\*\*

Dear xxx,

QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT is a 90,000-word contemporary STEM romance that will appeal to fans of Ali Hazelwood's *Love, Theoretically* and Christina Lauren's *The Soulmate Equation*.

Dr. Evelyn Cavendish prefers protons over people. As MIT's rising star in quantum physics, she's perfectly content with her precisely ordered world of coherence algorithms and error correction codes. But when tech billionaire Max Starr maneuvers her university into ""lending"" her to his company for three months, her carefully ordered world descends into chaos. Between his irritatingly handsome face and his genuine dedication to science, Max proves harder to resist than quantum decoherence.

Max Starr didn't get where he is by playing it safe. But his latest gamble—pursuing revolutionary quantum communication technology—might cost him everything. With his board breathing down his neck and a rival company threatening to beat him to a breakthrough, Max needs Evelyn's brilliant mind to stabilize his network of quantum-enabled satellites. He didn't anticipate she'd become the one variable he can't live without, as her passion for discovery leaves him more breathless than any business deal.

As they race against time to maintain quantum coherence across vast distances, Evelyn and Max find their own lives becoming increasingly entangled. But when corporate espionage threatens their work and Max's hidden connection to Evelyn's past surfaces, they'll have to decide if the uncertainty of love is worth the risk of measurement. Like quantum particles, they'll either collapse under observation or prove that some connections transcend all explanation.

\*\*\*

First 300:

A stray curl escapes my ponytail as I bend over the workbench, where fiber optic cables snake between miniature prisms like a glass jungle. Fans whir overhead like mechanical cicadas. Dr. Daniels' latest data printout lies crumpled in the wastepaper basket—his third failed attempt this month.

""Come on, you quantum nightmare,"" I whisper, fingers hovering over the alignment mirror. One breath. Two. I rotate it a microscopic fraction to the left. My MIT sweatshirt catches on a jagged edge of the apparatus. 

The laser beam jumps.

My shoulders ache from hunching over hardware that should be someone else's problem. The whiteboard in my office probably misses me—its clean lines and elegant equations gathering dust while I play mechanic. The previous day's coffee rings stain my notebook where theoretical models wait to be tested.

Green lights dance across the prototype as I initiate the sequence. Numbers flood the screen, my pulse quickening with each new data point. Until—

""Seriously?"" I groan as error messages flood the screen. ""What is it now? Heisenberg's ghost playing tricks?""

My phone vibrates somewhere in the chaos of the desk. Without looking up, I swipe to silence it. Probably Mum asking if I've eaten today. (Have I eaten today? Has the FDA reclassified coffee as a food group yet?)

Back to the maze of connections. Each component gets a gentle prod, every cable a careful wiggle. The laser casts ghostly shadows across my hands as I hunt for the flaw in this physical manifestation of my equations.

The lab door swings open with a bang. I jolt, nearly knocking over a carefully aligned laser. Great. Because what this day really needed was a mini heart attack and a lab safety violation.

""Dr. Cavendish!""

I have a lovely story about my brothers and their girlfriends from last Christmas.

I live in the American Midwest, my parents live in Florida, and my brothers live in Eugene, Oregon, where I also lived for a while. Needless to say, we don't get together as a family often. For the last couple of years, my parents have rented a large house in Eugene for us all to gather for Christmas. We've had a couple of serious illnesses in the family, so the time together was especially special. I had been struggling with some debilitating health issues which left me unemployed for a looooong time, so money was extremely tight as I was living off savings. I love coffee and spend a lot of time sourcing freshly roasted beans from across the US and the world, I have a special grinder, and over ten brewing methods at my house to suit the type of coffee mood I'm in each day. (Extra, I know, but when you're homebound, it's the simple joys. <3) Last year for Christmas, my brothers arrived at the rented Eugene house with a Breville espresso machine that had been purchased between them and their girlfriends as a special Christmas gift to me. And, instead of mailing it to my house right away, they gave it to me in Eugene so the whole family could use it for the month. Then, in the couple days before we left to return to our respective homes, they paid to have it shipped to me. I LOVE my at-home espresso machine and I love to make coffee drinks for visitors. I've even taken to crafting my own, homemade, organic coffee syrups for those that like a little sweetness in their drinks. Thanks, bros, and girlfriends-in-law. ☕️ 🟩

1hwnwvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1hwnwvt/why_do_men_have_an_issue_with_their_spouse_gf/,Why do men have an issue with their spouse / gf having male friends ?,"Hi everyone, some background. so I 24F have always had trouble my entire adult life making female friends. It honestly devastates me. I've always been jealous of women friendships and I don’t have any sisters. I did put a lot of thought into it, trying to find and address the reason I'm incapable of maintaining any female friend relationships. For some background, I'm know I'm goodlooking. I really am not trying to toot my own horn or sound like a 'pretty problem', I'm just looking for genuine advice.  If it would help you get the picture – I'm slim and kind of fit, my hair is naturally blond (which is rare in my country) thick and goes down almost past my back. My skin is tan and eyes are greyish green.  I'm outgoing and I also would like to believe that I'm a fun person to be around (starting to doubt that).

So yes, I am good looking, and I've always attracted a lot of attention from men, and I'm aware of that. I'm not shy but Its important you know that I'm definitely not an attention seeker, I don’t really like to be the center of attention and I would absolutely never try to steal anyone's 'thunder' or outshine them on purpose (especially women).  When I was in collage, we had a group of 4-5 ladies , after graduation, we used to meet up at least once a month, over time I noticed that I was the only one initiating in the group chat and they were avoiding me every time with excuses. It all came to an end when I asked again in the chat whose free tonight, they all gave lame excuses and then that same night I saw them all together out in a bar in an Insta story. Obviously, I was hurt. Then I spent a few weeks going over and over every encounter and outing, looking to find something that I may have done to offend or hurt them. When I found none, I finally reached out to one of the girlfriends (20F) at the time, and asked her about it. after she tried to doge the question a few times she finally came clean and basically said ""well, its just not fun to go out with you"" when I asked why or what did I do, she told me that it's because all the male attention was on me.  After that I just cut them all off, dropped the idea of female friendship and moved on. It's been 6 years since that incident, over the years I've made a few attempts but never managed to get through the superficial friendship with women.

The only real friends I made are my three male best friends (28M) (25M) (30M). It's not a group, they are all separate from different chapters in my life. It's strictly platonic, never had a crush, no moves have been made, no dates, nothing physical of course. We are all in different places in life and I see each one of them once every two months approximately. We go for a coffee and catch up. Mainly talk on the phone for hours when someone is driving. two of them are in a long-term relationship, one is married. I've met and known their spouses and have a very good relationship with them, we go out with more friends of theirs together and such. I'm not actually friends with their spouses but we keep in touch and plan events together like surprise birthday parties and stuff like that. I never touch my male friends, never stick my nose in their relationships, and make an effort not to be a 3^(rd) wheel and get in the way. I make sure to check if they are free to talk and don’t call out of the blue in case, they are spending time with their loved one.

Now finally to the issue, I've seen stories here with lies and infidelity and people who feel uncomfortable with male female friendships that affect their relationships. But I hope I made it clear that isn’t the case here. I do not have a single female good friend. And when my boyfriend started to argue about me being friends with men only, I asked him what would he expect me to do? cut them off and live my life without any friends ? I explained to him my issue that I'm struggling to make female friends and it's been a long time since I've been successful. The argument went in circles and finally we decided to take a brake. There were other reasons for that, and it's only been 6 months of dating. But I am concerned about the future. What if all men would feel uncomfortable with this? my mother always says that a friendship between a man and a woman is impossible and not natural. I believe that is extremely rare but possible.  Now at first it seems like a good solution to form a group, but keep in mind that it is extremely rare for 4 plus people to get along let alone actually WANT to spend time together. So, what if the majority of men feel the same way? What if these mixed friendships just don’t work when each has a spouse ? the same goes for the opposite situations for boyfriends and husbands with female friends. Maybe it's different for men and women ? (because it doesn’t really bother me personally if my man has a female friend as long as it's appropriate). What do men feel about it ?. Are there any years-long married folks here who can share? Are mixed gender friendships possible to maintain ?  I would really love to hear and learn from all your experience.",2,1736353064.0,NoStupidQuestions,31,0.62,False

I was holding my glorious cup of coffee in front of me and facing towards my son. He proceeded to throw a toy directly into my fresh cup of happiness. I was too impressed to be mad, but was annoyed as hell that I now had coffee all over me. I feel like that's 90% of parenting though, just thinking ""damn, I'm impressed but wtf""",22,1736353054.0,Mommit,2,1.0,False

We’re planning a trip for this coming April and are looking for recommendations on the best true all-inclusive resorts (no constant upcharges, please!). Here’s what we’re looking for:

	•	Excellent food
	•	Top-shelf drinks
	•	Cleanliness and great service
	•	Teen-friendly atmosphere
	•	Beautiful, non-seaweed-infested beach
	•	Beachside service
	•	Smaller, boutique-style resort (we’re not looking to walk a mile for coffee)
	•	Swim-up rooms (not a deal breaker, but a bonus!)

We previously stayed at The Beloved when they used to allow kids, and it was the best we’ve found so far!

Here are some of the resorts we’re considering:

	•	Fives Oceanfront Puerto Morelos
	•	Majestic Elegance
	•	Paradisus Playa del Carmen
	•	Barcelo Maya Beach
	•	Grand Residences
	•	Finest (probably the most expensive)

Do you have any other great recommendations? We’d love to hear your suggestions!

It was on my mind, so today I’m working at my coffee shop and a lady named Emma comes through the line. She pulls up to the window and I say, “so, do you like the Jane Austen story “Emma,” or are you sick of it?”

This lady, in her 50s at minimum, in Texas, says “who?” 

“Jane Austen? She wrote Pride and Prejudice?” 

“Oh?” 

“Yeah, she also wrote a book called Emma. It’s good!” 

That was about it, but I’m left a bit gobsmacked. Maybe the average 50yo woman in the US hasn’t heard of Emma (maybe) but even someone NAMED Emma has never heard of it? I’m the first person in five decades to say “oh, like the timeless classic literary heroine (or possibly antihero if you want to have that argument but whatevs)?” ",39,1736352952.0,janeausten,35,0.83,False
