1hcerj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1hcerj9/make_every_day_count/,Make every day count :),"Hey guys,

Long story short I‚Äôm no longer a firefighter, haven‚Äôt been for several months now. I had to leave after a medical diagnosis. Today more than normal I‚Äôve been missing my friends at the department, my crew at my full time department, and the things we got up to. 

I just wanted to throw this out into the universe- one day every single one of us will have to walk away from this job, some of us by choice, some of us won‚Äôt have a choice. And we don‚Äôt know when our time to hang it up is actually going to be. 

I know there were days I let admin stuff get me down, or I‚Äôd let some silly calls annoy me, or I‚Äôd get annoyed with C shift for leaving the apparatus dirty and a morsel of cake in the dish at shift change to not feel guilty about leaving the mess.

So do me a favor and when things get routine, or when admin issues come up or someone steals your coffee creamer, just remember that one day you‚Äôll climb onto a fire truck for the very last time and that‚Äôll be it. 

Try and enjoy it while it lasts my friends. :)

I‚Äôm a better person for having the opportunity to do this as long as I did, and the friends I made along the way mean the world to me. I‚Äôm a little bummed out today as it continues to sink in that I‚Äôve probably climbed onto that truck with my friends for the last time, and I didn‚Äôt know it would be the last time when it happened, but I‚Äôm grateful for being able to take the ride at all. 

And also, for me, please take care of yourselves and your gear. Get that lump checked out, don‚Äôt write your fatigue off as just part of being a firefighter without at least getting some bloodwork done. 

That‚Äôs all for my soap box. I miss you guys, and I just wish I appreciated the day to day things more than I did at the time. If you‚Äôre able to do that, you‚Äôll be glad you did when your time comes too. :)",3,1733983783.0,Firefighting,0,1.0,False

1. Post-nasal drip after drinking water (basically, I sip water & then immediately can bring phlegm from my nasal cavity and spit it out). During meals, the post-nasal drip seems less noticeable since I am likely swallowing it along with my food. Throat clearings & some hoarseness while talking if drinking water/eating but zero throat pain. 

2. Immediate temple headache on right side after drinking/sipping water

I'm visiting Perth for the first time in my life and will be spending Christmas here, possibly even New Year's( or in other cities I am thinking). I'll be staying at my friend's place in Bentley and then traveling to other cities in Australia. I know it will be hot, so this will likely be the warmest Christmas I've experienced!

I am wondering what's happening in Perth during Christmas? I tired to look up online but not much information. Are there any festive activities you would recommend? 

I can't drive, but I'm open to meeting new people even just a cup of coffee since my friends will probably be working. Is night activities not very common here ?

My friend I used to work with, over the past year, she went on two international trips and brought back a thoughtful gift (\~$30 USD in total) for me.

She came back from another trip and asked me to get coffee this week at her favorite spot, and told me she has a small gift from her trip for me. I will of course buy coffee/pastry/etc for us, but I'm wondering if I should get her something else? She will be starting a new job soon, and I think to have a friend is to be a friend.

**Questions**:

1. **Is it a good idea to get her a gift as well as buying coffee?** Her occasion to gift was trips (which I don't really take). If so, how can I give it without it coming across as awkward?
2. We are both single. She is incredible, but I don't know if this is a friendly occasion or something more. **How can I find out what she thinks without messing up a friendship?** (*I am socially inept and don't pick up on many social cues*).

I have a lot of time to think about what happen in our 3 years together and well there a lot to say.
I realized now that our relationship was toxic and one sided but to get shit off my chest lets start from the beginning.
I remember how we both worked at the same coffee shop and how we got to be such great friends. How you ask me out on a coffee date by accident and I said yes. How it was love at first sight and I meet your family got to know then. Then how when thing where going south how I told you that I felt like something was off and how you responded to me with a breakup. That hurt so I left and tried to distract myself but you still wanted to be freinds and I avoided you cause it hurt to see you.
How you sent me a long message saying that you wanted to talk things out and I came back. You told me that I was not giving you enough attention so I gave you more even though I was working 2 jobs and barley had time to myself after I spent most of my free time with you. Just for you to break up with me again right before our double date and I had already paid for my ticket to go. So I still went and forced myself to be ok and have fun to find out right after you got with another guy that was 10 years older then you and has a kid that you meet online and was planning on seeing him only after a week of you two dating. Me and your family agreed that that was a stupid discussion and tired our best to get you not to go because I was worried about your safety. You told me that it was just a rebound and that the real reason you broke up with me was cause I gave you to much attention. So I changed again and let you be more free. For a while after things were great and I let you move in with me. Told myself it was OK if you did not know how to drive I'll drive you to work and back. Witch meet i only had about 4 hours of down time each day after I work so I can take you to work and pick you up.
Even after I found out you where sending pics of yourself in your underwear to all your freinds in a public sever that anyone can join and I still tired to understand why you did it and even came up with a compromise dispute how uncomfortable I was about it. When you told it me it was for ""body positivity"".
No matter how many times you got angry at me cause I was kind to a Stanger or even yelled at me cause a store clerk ask me if I needed help and give me small talk cause they liked my shirt.
After all of that you still left me again and went for another online relationship behind my back after 3 years of being together and me changing myself, cleaning after you, cooking for you, and telling you I would never talk to anyone but you cause you where the one I loved. You still cheated on my in another online relationship and send veidos of yourself undressing in frount of a camera to you guy freind. I snap and kick you out and lost my cool. It's been about 2 or 3 months now I hope that guy makes you happy now so please stop hanging around my freinds and worry about that new man of yours. Everytime I think of you I get so angry for letting someone use me over and over again but now it time for me to let go.
So I have one last thing to say. Thank you for showing ne how valuable I am and showing me how I want to be treated. And that this is the last time I'll ever forgive you.",1,1733982935.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

1hceabc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hceabc/im_24f_thinking_about_getting_back_with_my/,I‚Äôm (24F) thinking about getting back with my ex-boyfriend (25F) but my parents hate him. Is this whole thing a bad idea?,"I (24F) met my my now-ex-boyfriend (25F) while studying in a different state and we were together for 2 years before he actually came with me to visit my parents in my hometown.

In those 2 years, we had some ups and downs. To highlight the ‚Äúred flags‚Äù so you can tell me if these are actually terrible:
(1) He is a very type-A person that tends to mansplain. He is very egocentric, loves talking about himself, and thinks he is basically European because he lived in France for a year (he is American and has no CLOSE European background or anything). He likes to be very dominant intellectually. Before I even got to see this side of him, he kind of admitted that he has these grandiose tendencies that resemble his father‚Äôs personality and that he dislikes that about himself.
(2) We are both still financially dependent on our respective parents (we are in med school) and my parents are way more flexible in giving me money, whereas his parents really do not give him much. He can‚Äôt afford things a lot, and he fundamentally disagrees with me in the belief that especially in the beginning of a relationship, it is courteous for the man to want to pay for most things (and not just split the bill) on most dates. He notoriously never did that and since gift-giving is my preferred way to give and receive ‚Äúlove,‚Äù I often kind of COMPULSIVELY paid/offered to pay everything to avoid that awkward mkment where he would go‚Ä¶. ‚Äúso‚Ä¶ 50/50?‚Äù My fault there, I guess. I dunno.

Outside romantic relationships, I consider myself to be a pretty confident and outspoken woman. However, I have some pretty bad unresolved daddy issues and in all my previous ROMANTIC relationships, I tend to just go with the flow and be quite passive (due to fear of rejection or disapproval from my partner). Therefore, with this guy, I was prone to over-apologizing, admitting ‚Äúdefeat,‚Äù and acting like some na√Øve girl. So, it was not a great time sometimes, given that this ‚Äúpersona‚Äù that I adopted with him conflicts directly with who I am outside romantic relationships. However, the guy‚Äôs not a complete egomaniac; he‚Äôs talented, intelligent, sensitive, loving, genuine, a great listener, and we‚Äôd often engage in productive conversations for conflict-resolution. I just had a hard time communicating my discontent a lot of the time, so I bottled up a loooot of contempt. 

After 2 years of dating with this dynamic, we flew from the state where we both go to med school, to where my parents live. This was the first time he and my parents interacted. Of course, they knew about him and via text/call with my mom especially, I was generally pretty open about some of the ups and downs of my relationship. I greatly value my parents‚Äô opinion and we are very close. They are very reasonable people.

Anyway, long story short, my now-ex-boyfriend and I stayed at my parents‚Äô for 3 weeks and they quickly picked up on the negative parts of his personality. Here are the highlights:
(1) ‚ÄúI taught [your daughter] this‚Ä¶ I showed [your daughter] how to do that‚Ä¶‚Äù
(2) Didn‚Äôt even OFFER to invite my parents to a single meal or coffee while we were there living off my parents. Obviously, he never paid for his own meals either. My parents covered everything and even took us to a super expensive all-inclusive ski-resort for a week. He didn‚Äôt pay a dime of anything or even pretend to pull out his wallet.
(3) Made a face when my mom offered him some wine that did not seem to fulfill whatever French standards he was holding it to
(4) Said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just used to playing more complex things‚Äù when he couldn‚Äôt keep up with a jam session with my dad who let him use one of his guitars.

After that trip, my parents communicated their disapproval of him. I really internalized this and my thoughts snowballed and spiralled and I ended up breaking up with him. To not make this longer, it has been 8 months since we have broken up. He reached out to me a month ago and he told me he has gone to therapy and has given thought to the reasons I had for breaking up with him, and that he thinks he can change. He listed literally all my complaints off woth possible solutions. He misses me and I miss him. My parents still hate him based on that trip, though. Is their relentless disapproval valid?

I dumped my ex gf because she self sabotage our relationship by causing fights, disrespecting boundaries multiple times.

I was shock but did not begged or cried. Immediately went no contact. We still occasionally see each other at work.

I bought my first Nomatic backpack back in 2020 and bought a new one in January 2024 (not because the previous one was broken but I just wanted the new one)

I personally got the Nomatic 20L, and love it.

First off, the design is sleek and modern. The black, water-resistant material not only looks great but keeps your stuff protected from rain showers (or the occasional coffee spill, no judgment there lol).

What I love most about it is how much thought has been poured into the compartments. There‚Äôs a dedicated laptop sleeve, a safe pocket for your cards, hidden pockets for valuables, and even magnetic water bottle holders. It‚Äôs like the bag wants you to win at staying organized.

You can carry it to work, pack it for an overnight trip, or even use it on a flight. You can use it for business trips too, it looks great and quite professional.

That said, it isn‚Äôt super light, even when empty, so if you tend to carry a ton, you‚Äôll feel it. And as much as I like all the compartments, sometimes I forget where I put things, so there‚Äôs a bit of a learning curve.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is a popular cosmetic procedure that promises a brighter smile and increased confidence. When considering a teeth whitening treatment, many people often contemplate the impact of their decision by looking at before and after results. These real results help individuals gauge the effectiveness of various methods. Understanding the differences in results can guide your choice in selecting the most suitable whitening option.

### Common Teeth Whitening Methods

Several teeth whitening methods are available, each yielding different results. Here's a brief overview:

- **Professional Whitening:** Conducted in a dental office, this method produces noticeable and often dramatic results. Dentists use stronger bleaching agents than those available over the counter.
- **At-Home Whitening Kits:** These kits usually include trays and whitening gel. Results can vary widely depending on the product and adherence to instructions.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** While convenient, the results are usually subtle and take longer to see. Whitening toothpaste works by removing surface stains.
- **Natural Remedies:** Options like baking soda or activated charcoal have gained popularity. However, results may not be as significant as with commercial products.

### The Science Behind Whitening

Teeth whitening is largely about the chemical process that lightens stains on your enamel. Most whitening products contain hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. These ingredients work by penetrating the enamel and breaking down stains. The impact you see can depend on several factors, including:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
1. Type of stains (extrinsic vs. intrinsic)
2. Duration of treatment
3. Concentration of the whitening agent
4. Your oral hygiene routine

### Before and After: Real-Life Transformations

Visual transformations can be highly motivating for those considering teeth whitening. Here‚Äôs what you might see before and after treatment:

Before a whitening treatment, teeth may appear dull or stained due to food, drink, or tobacco use. Color variations can manifest, with significant yellowing being common. After treatment, many people report:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Significantly brighter teeth, often several shades lighter
- A more vibrant smile that enhances overall facial aesthetics
- Increased confidence during social interactions

### What to Expect from Different Methods

Knowing the potential outcomes of different whitening treatments can set realistic expectations. Here's a closer look:

- **Professional Whitening:** Results are visible immediately, with teeth becoming up to eight shades lighter in a single session. Touch-ups may be necessary every six months to maintain the brightness.
- **At-Home Kits:** Results will generally appear after a few days to weeks, depending on usage. Expect teeth to lighten between two to six shades with consistent application.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** Subtle lightening may occur over several weeks. Most users report a change of half a shade, which might not be noticeable immediately.

### Maintaining Your Results

Following teeth whitening, maintaining your results is crucial to ensure your smile remains bright. Here are some tips to consider:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Practice good oral hygiene by brushing twice a day and flossing daily.
- Avoid foods and drinks that may stain teeth, such as coffee, tea, and red wine.
- Use a straw when consuming beverages that can discolor your teeth.
- Consider touch-up treatments as needed, particularly after consuming stain-causing foods and drinks.

Teeth whitening before and after transformations speak volumes about the effectiveness of various methods. Whether you opt for professional treatments or home kits, the impact is often worth the investment. By knowing your options, you can choose a method that aligns best with your smile goals. Remember, a bright smile not only enhances your teeth but can also elevate your confidence daily.

Common Myths About Teeth Whitening: What You Need to Know Before and After Treatment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is a popular cosmetic procedure, and many people are eager to achieve a brighter smile. However, several myths surrounding this treatment can lead to confusion and misinformation. It's essential to understand these misconceptions to make informed decisions before and after your whitening treatment.

### Myth 1: Teeth Whitening is a One-Time Treatment

Many believe that a single whitening session will yield permanent results. In reality, the effects of teeth whitening can vary based on individual habits. For example, if you frequently consume coffee, tea, or red wine, your teeth may stain again more quickly. Therefore, it's advisable to plan for touch-up sessions every few months to maintain your brighter smile.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth 2: All Teeth Whitening Products are the Same

There are numerous teeth whitening products available, ranging from over-the-counter gels and strips to professional treatments provided by dentists. The effectiveness and safety of these products can differ significantly. Professional whitening options typically use stronger bleaching agents that deliver faster and more noticeable results compared to at-home kits. Always check the ingredients and consult a dental professional to find the best option for your needs.

### Myth 3: Whitening Can Damage Your Teeth

This fear holds some truth if the whitening treatment is misused. Overusing whitening products or using substandard products can lead to enamel erosion and tooth sensitivity. However, when performed correctly and monitored by a dental professional, teeth whitening is generally safe. It‚Äôs crucial to follow instructions carefully and discuss any concerns with your dentist before beginning treatment.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth 4: Whitening Treatments Work on All Types of Stains

Not all dental stains respond equally to whitening treatments. There are two main types of stains: extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic stains, caused by surface-level factors like coffee and tobacco, often respond well to whitening. However, intrinsic stains, which stem from deeper inside the tooth due to trauma or certain medications, may not lighten effectively with routine whitening procedures. Understanding the cause of your discoloration can help set realistic expectations.

### Myth 5: More Frequent Whitening Leads to Whiter Teeth

Some individuals think that using whitening products more often will achieve faster or more significant results. In reality, excessive whitening can harm your teeth and gums. This could lead to increased sensitivity or even gum irritation. Instead of frequent whitening, focus on maintaining a good oral hygiene routine and consult your dentist for a personalized plan that suits your needs.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth 6: Whitening is Only for Adults

A common misconception is that only adults can benefit from teeth whitening. However, teenagers and older children can also seek treatment, provided they have all their permanent teeth. That said, it‚Äôs crucial to assess the health of their teeth and gums. Consulting with a pediatric dentist can ensure that younger patients are good candidates for whitening treatments.

### Myth 7: Teeth Whitening is Painful

While some people may experience mild sensitivity during or after treatment, whitening does not have to be a painful experience. Many modern whitening products include desensitizing agents to minimize discomfort. If you‚Äôre concerned about pain, make sure to communicate with your dentist. They can suggest the best whitening method tailored to your sensitivity level.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Confusion with Cosmetic Procedures:** Teeth whitening is often misunderstood as a procedure that requires surgery or extensive dental work when it‚Äôs not. Most methods are quick and non-invasive.
- **Ongoing Maintenance:** Regular dental cleanings and good oral hygiene can keep your teeth looking great post-whitening.

By debunking these common myths about teeth whitening, you can approach your treatment with confidence and clarity. Remember, achieving a bright smile is possible with the right information and tools. Always consult with a dental professional to ensure the safety and effectiveness of your whitening journey, setting you up for long-lasting and satisfying results.

### Conclusion

Achieving a brighter smile through teeth whitening can significantly enhance your confidence and overall appearance. The difference seen in before and after photos is often striking, showcasing the power of effective treatments. Whether you choose professional services, at-home kits, or natural alternatives, results can vary greatly depending on the method. Understanding each option helps you make informed decisions that align with your expectations and needs.

However, it‚Äôs essential to sift through the myths surrounding teeth whitening. Many people have misconceptions about safety, effectiveness, and potential side effects. It's crucial to dispel these myths, as they can lead to undue worry or poorly-informed choices regarding your dental care. Engaging with reliable information not only empowers you but also ensures a safe journey to a dazzling smile.

Currently going through the leap of becoming a general contractor. 

I do have a few questions if anyone is able to help me out. 

1. I am not looking for the short cut, but as a commercial general contractor, how did you receive your leads? Should I do competitive bidding (client gives a software their project details and a lot of GCs bid on it)

- I am currently thinking about going to architectural firms with a pamphlet basically explaining who we are and my background/ bringing some coffee or donuts. 
- the other method I thought of was going to small business owners and just giving them my contact information and same thing as above.

I've been in the hobby nito lang October 2024. (Yes sobrang bata pa) Experience ko was just Bench or Penshoppe body sprays , have to add I owned CK One when I was young pero that was a long long time ago, at eto na nga nahulog na ko sa rabbit hole haha but in a way, puro decants lang naman ang binibili ko, max of 5ml. I get the thrill kasi on trying out different scents from different brands especially yung mga local brands natin na own blend nila. 

I tried TBGCO, F&S Gentleman, Greg Parilla's Dreamer collection 2/3, Artisan's by Ian Ara√±o, Parfum Astraux, Tadhana Fragrance that I'd say niche quality na.

I owned some M.E. Frags na rin and alam ko na rin naman talaga ung gagamitin ko on a daily basis. I got Luxodor Shogun, Armaf Hunter , Lattafa Ramz Silver, Emir Cedrat Essence. 

So for my question, ano pa kayang mga ""unique"" notes ang pwedeng ma try? I tried gourmand na, Coffee , Tobacco, Leather, Citrus, Fruity, Sweet, Floral, Woody, Musky, Fresh, Aquatic, Vanilla. 

Any suggestions are highly appreciated.

1hcdq9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hcdq9c/observer_effect/,Observer Effect,"Dr. Sarah Chen hadn't slept in thirty-six hours. The lab's coffee machine had given up sometime around midnight, but she barely noticed. Her eyes were fixed on the initial calibration results displaying across her holographic workspace, her hands trembling as she swiped through the data streams. After five years of development, countless funding battles, and three complete rebuilds, the Temporal Light Correction Array was finally operational.

The facility sprawled across thirty square kilometers of the Atacama Desert, its quantum processors and temporal sensors arranged in precise geometric patterns that reminded her of the ancient Nazca Lines. The location had been chosen for its clear skies and minimal light pollution, but Sarah sometimes wondered if they'd been drawn here by something deeper‚Äîsome unconscious recognition of the desert's ability to preserve secrets.

""You should eat something,"" Dr. James Rodriguez said, sliding a protein bar across her desk. Her co-lead on the project looked as exhausted as she felt. The silver at his temples had spread considerably since they'd started the project. ""Can't make history on an empty stomach.""

Sarah managed a weak smile. ""Pretty sure Galileo did.""

""Galileo didn't have to manage a hundred trillion quantum calculations per second."" James pulled up a chair, his dark eyes reflecting the soft blue glow of the displays. ""Are you sure you want to do the full-sky scan tonight? We could start with a smaller section, maybe‚Äî""

""We've waited long enough,"" Sarah interrupted. The weight of anticipation pressed down on her chest. ""Humanity has spent its entire existence looking at a lie. Every time we've gazed up at the stars, we've been seeing the past‚Äîyears, decades, centuries old light that tells us nothing about what's actually out there right now. Today, we finally see the truth.""

James nodded slowly. ""Beginning first full-sky scan,"" he announced over the intercom. Throughout the facility, the enormous array of quantum processors hummed to life, processing the incoming light and adjusting for temporal displacement in real-time.

The main holographic display flickered and stabilized. Sarah's protein bar dropped from nerveless fingers.

Where there had been stars, now there was... something else. The familiar constellations were gone, replaced by vast geometric patterns that pulsed with an unsettling regularity. They were clearly artificial, clearly purposeful, and completely alien to anything in human experience.

""My God,"" whispered James, his face ashen. ""Those aren't random. They're... they're getting closer.""

Sarah's mind raced as she analyzed the patterns. The stellar positions showed that what they were seeing wasn't just ships or structures‚Äîentire star systems had been reorganized, their positions shifted to create these massive geometric forms. The scale was beyond incomprehensible. It would take the energy output of multiple civilizations just to move a single star. This was evidence of engineering at a galactic scale.

And then she noticed something that made her blood run cold. The patterns weren't just moving closer‚Äîthey were accelerating. When she overlaid the historical stellar data, she could see it clearly: whatever force was transforming the galaxy had been moving steadily in their direction for thousands of years.

They had been watching an invasion in slow motion, hidden by the speed of light itself.

""We need to contact the other observatories,"" James said, already reaching for his phone. His hand was shaking so badly he could barely dial. ""Get independent confirmation‚Äî""

""Look at the edge patterns,"" Sarah interrupted, her voice barely a whisper. She manipulated the display, highlighting a series of smaller geometric forms that bordered the larger configurations. ""They're changing. Every time we take a new reading, they're different.""

James leaned closer, squinting. ""Could be an error in the temporal calculations‚Äî""

""No."" Sarah's throat was dry. ""They're responding to us. To our observations. They know we can see them now.""

The next day, observatories around the world confirmed their findings. Humanity had finally seen the present-day sky, only to discover we were surrounded. The geometric patterns now dominated nearly a quarter of the visible sky, and preliminary calculations suggested they would reach Earth in less than a decade.

The world's governments responded as expected‚Äîwith a mixture of denial, panic, and desperate militarization. NASA and other space agencies began drafting plans for defensive satellites and early warning systems. Religious leaders proclaimed everything from the end times to the second coming. The night sky became a source of global terror, with people covering their windows and children having nightmares about geometric shapes.

Sarah stopped sleeping entirely. She spent every night at the facility, watching the patterns evolve, trying to decipher their meaning. James worried about her, but she couldn't stop. She knew she was missing something crucial.

Three weeks after the initial discovery, she was alone in the lab, running yet another analysis, when the first anomaly appeared. A faint geometric shimmer, visible to the naked eye, pulsing in perfect rhythm with the patterns they'd detected. She ran outside, heart pounding, and stared up at the contaminated sky.

The shimmer was spreading, like a crack in reality itself. The light delay‚Äîthe fundamental constant that had kept humanity ignorant and calm for so long‚Äîwas being systematically dismantled.

When the last transmission came through from the Temporal Array before it went dark, it contained a single image: the patterns had changed. They now formed recognizable shapes‚Äîa countdown, written in the language of harvested stars.

Sarah spent three days analyzing that final transmission, barely eating, refusing to sleep. There was something about the rhythm of the pattern changes, something hauntingly familiar. When the realization finally came, it hit her with the force of a physical blow.

The patterns weren't counting down. They were repeating. And she'd seen them before.

With trembling hands, she pulled up the earliest known astronomical records‚Äîancient Babylonian star charts, Medieval maps, even cave paintings showing the night sky. In each one, buried in the background, she found traces of the same geometric patterns, so faint they'd been dismissed as recording errors or artistic flourishes.

The truth was impossibly worse than they'd imagined. What they'd discovered wasn't an approaching invasion. It was a temporal loop, an endless cycle of cause and effect. The light from the stars hadn't been showing them the past at all‚Äîit had been showing them an echo of Earth's ultimate future, repeated endlessly across time. A future where humanity itself would evolve, or be transformed, into the very beings that were rearranging the stars.

And by finally observing our own future with the Temporal Array, we had just guaranteed it would happen.

Sarah's final report, found after she disappeared from the facility, contained just three words: ""We close circle.""

Above her empty desk, the geometric patterns continued their eternal dance, spreading across the sky like cracks in time itself‚Äîhumanity's future reaching back through the light years to ensure its own creation.

1hcdjuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/cptsd_bipoc/comments/1hcdjuj/discouraged_to_pursue_nursing_due_to_amount_of/,Discouraged to pursue nursing due to amount of white women in healthcare,"Hey guys. So I‚Äôm going to be an EMT and love the world of emergency healthcare. I wanted to get into paramedicine in the near future but I chose nursing for the versatility, and I‚Äôm taking some courses as prerequisites. But nursing as a whole is a white female dominated field and it makes me anxious. 

I have always been ostracized for being the brown girl. I notice it up even to now where white girls will congregate together and ignore me but during awkward silences will suddenly ask me dumb shit about my brown skin or heritage or question where I was actually born. This has been in social settings, classroom work etc. And I frankly don‚Äôt want to be around white women. Which sucks bc well every field no matter what will be white dominated regardless. 

I have always been treated as an other and I know very well that whites assume Im some dumb immigrant (i mean look at the way they treat locals when they ‚Äúbackpack‚Äù and vacation around the world.) I have been asked if I speak English in the past and nobody will ever believe I was born in the states to where they get almost argumentative and they hate that I shut them down. Rn Im in an anatomy class and all the white women ignore me until they want to exchange lab answers. 

I‚Äôve tried to be like them ‚Äî talk about boyfriends and dogs and traveling and coffee and other shit but idk if i have something on my face or I sound weird or what. I‚Äôve always stuck out and I have no choice but to assume it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm brown. Bc everyone ignores me 99% of the time and then when they don‚Äôt? It‚Äôs the ‚Äúwhere are you from‚Äù ‚Äúoh your skin!‚Äù ‚Äúare you indian or arab or mexican?‚Äù can you speak another language ?‚Äù ‚Äúdo you practice muslim?‚Äù

I know how nasty these women can be too. I‚Äôve worked as a CNA and heard white women say fucked shit about the black women i‚Äôve worked with , and I‚Äôve heard N word come out their mouths. I heard a messed up joke about Nigerians too and it‚Äôs all YT women doing it. And if they do this in front of me chances are they do a whole lot behind my back too. 

Everyone in my life thinks Im being hyperbolic which pisses me off bc it means they don‚Äôt believe me or my feelings at all. I want to further my career but being around white women is one of the most suffocating positions to be in. I‚Äôd like to expand my medical knowledge too and avoid this shit tanking economy were in (oh but to the YTs Trump will fix all that!!). 

Somedays I think it‚Äôs fine and then I‚Äôll go to my class and think ‚Äúthis is going to be everywhere I go.‚Äù And decide I don‚Äôt want to do it anymore.

Healthcare alone can be so fucking racist too. I‚Äôve seen people demand white doctors and white nurses, assume the black or brown doctor is the housekeeper or CNA. They think black people can take pain better than white people, get mad at brown people for excelling in the field bc IMMIGRANTS TAKE JOBSSSSS. And the amount of  catty bitch bullying in nursing toward darker skinned women is unreal. 

and I do not see myself taking that well lol. I will scream at a mfucker. I don‚Äôt play high school bully gossip shit. which makes me wonder even if i made it through nursing school, could i even keep my cool??????

I‚Äôm 34 and finally done having kids. I still have 10 more months of breastfeeding and then my body will 100% be mine again. 

That said, I‚Äôve never really been healthy. When I was in my early 20s, I was very attractive and fit. Mostly by luck if I‚Äôm honest. I swam in high school but not in college. So I was very active for those short years of life. When I turned 21 and started going to The bars, That‚Äôs when the weight started coming on but I managed to keep it at bay til I started having kids. 
It‚Äôs been over a decade and I have developed terrible eating habits and I‚Äôm addicted to sugar. Realistically I could lose 80 pounds. I need to lose at least 40 for my own health. 

I‚Äôve always had this dream of being fit, yes in a physical sense but in overall health. I want to not get tired chasing my toddler around. I want to have energy from 5am to 10pm. I don‚Äôt want to need a nap everyday. I want to thrive and not survive. And I‚Äôd like to do this while I‚Äôm still young. I look to my future and see now is the time to make changes if I want to be around for grandkids and live a fulfilling active life. 

Sooo how? Counting calories seems a bit much for me. I have adhd (unmedicated because I‚Äôve been pregnant or breastfeeding for 7 years). It‚Äôs very hard for me to commit and stay consistent. I crave junk food. I live off coffee. My life is go hi go from 6am til 11pm and sometimes at night when the baby wakes up. The gym is not an option for many reasons but the main one being I‚Äôm a SAHM whose husband works a dang lot. 

 So all this to say‚Ä¶if you see yourself in anything I wrote and managed to become healthier in your 30 and 40s‚Ä¶what did you do?",4,1733978392.0,AskWomenOver40,4,0.75,False

I‚Äôve been doing a ton of research on different scents that may be contenders for ‚Äúthe one‚Äù but 
I‚Äôm pretty overwhelmed and don‚Äôt know what scents to get samples of. 

My dream scent profile is something thats both sweet and gourmandy but also dark and spicy (I‚Äôm a Gemini üôÉ). Something seductive, flirty, intoxicating but also mysterious. 

More guidance -  

- Long lasting power and nice performance/silage is important for me. (I‚Äôm done with close to skin fragrances that last 30 mins) 
- the sweetness to be more grown up leaning (Diors hypnotic poison) rather than juvenile and artificial (early ariana grande perfume/fantasy)
- all year round fragrance but also can be more autumn/ winter leaning as weather is pretty gloomy all year where I am
- can be worn day and night and for most/ all occasions
- price - would prefer something cheaper/mid range, but if I really love it, I‚Äôll to up to $300 for 85ml - 100ml (or more if I REALLY love it)
- as for type of brands, id love something Arabian but it can also be celebrity or niche. 

Favourite notes - vanilla, tonka bean, sugar, caramel, toffee, honey, milk, cherry, raspberry, cinnamon, amber, almond, praline, smoke, leather, blood orange, rum, cacao, chocolate, coconut, pineapple, mango, coffee, honeysuckle, blackberry and blackcurrant

1hcdalp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1hcdalp/neurological_signs_that_doctors_keep_shrugging/,Neurological signs that doctors keep shrugging off‚Ä¶ LONG POST SORRY,"Okay so this is my first ever post and I‚Äôm curious to see if anyone has experienced similar symptoms and has ever found an answer from their doctor. I‚Äôm starting to feel super crazy because I have all these weird things that my body has been doing and have yet to get a diagnosis and more than that, no one seems concerned enough to dig deeper. 

In 2018, I was in a wedding. Prior to the wedding, I was practicing a song I was meant to perform and I blacked out and woke up seconds later- I had knocked a keyboard off the stand and didn‚Äôt remember a thing. I had also never passed out in my life at this point (mid-20s at the time). We gathered together for instructions or photos- I can‚Äôt recall- but it happened again, and this time I fell onto the photographer and came to immediately. I apologized profusely and she seemed annoyed (I can‚Äôt blame her), but maybe it didn‚Äôt look like I passed out- maybe it looked like I tripped and was still conscious at the time.

As things progressed, I started feeling numbness in my left hand and I kept dropping the thing I was holding in that hand. I was overwhelmed and confused and didn‚Äôt quite get what people were saying to me and I couldn‚Äôt quite get the words. After a bit, my ability to talk came back but I couldn‚Äôt walk straight. I kept walking, almost zigzagged, preparing to enter into the wedding ceremony. It took everything in me to not lose my balance during the wedding and I even sat and sang the song I that we asked to perform. 

I grabbed my family and informed them that after thinking about everything I experienced, I thought I had a stroke. 

All the testing at the hospital came out normal and they sent me for follow up testing with neuro. They did an MRI and didn‚Äôt see anything wrong with my brain or my spine, other than some mild narrowing and the already existing degenerative disc disease. 

They did a test to see how my sensation was in my limbs and it turned out I had dulled sensation to the touch in my left hand and my left foot. 

For weeks after this, I would have my left hand randomly spasm and I‚Äôd watch my phone fly across the room, drop things (like pots of coffee), and have some issues with walking straight lines without losing my balance. 

Neuro basically said they couldn‚Äôt figure out what was wrong. I got headaches a lot at the time, and I thought they were tension headaches because I got those as a kid too. These tended to make me throw up at time, and has gotten worse prior to the wedding. I remembered I had a headache at the wedding too and asked if a migraine could cause nerve damage and they told me no, that wasn‚Äôt possible. 

I continued on with the dulled sensation on the left side of my body (turns out it‚Äôs on my back on the left side of my spine, left side of my face, etc), and started to have some issues when I ate. This was in 2021. 

It got pretty common for a month or so where I‚Äôd go to eat a meal and I‚Äôd take a bite or two and then suddenly I‚Äôd be gagging on my food and unable to swallow anything for a bit. I brought it up to my practitioner and she sent me back to neurology. Did another MRI- no evidence of MS or anything like that. Again, neuro had no other thoughts and sent me on my way. 

I‚Äôve had headaches almost daily for 5 years and I have tried heat and medicine and sleeping and they don‚Äôt seem to go away with treatment. 

A month ago I went to urgent care because I had a headache that lasted a whole day and got worse and worse as the day progressed and then suddenly it felt like someone was scooping my eye out with a melon baller and twisting all the teeth on the left side of my head. 

Urgent care told me to get a referral to neuro and sent me home with instructions on how to treat tension headaches. 

I recently had an appointment with PT doctor because my left shoulder has had knots and pain and a crunching sensation for about a year and it won‚Äôt go away and a PA at my practitioners office blew me off a bit when I tried to explain the daily pain it caused. I tried stretching and heat and meds and massage, nothing helped for more than 10 minutes. 

The shoulder (left) was causing my tension headaches to increase in intensity and made me want to cry. Just before my PT appointment, I realized my left shoulder blade was ‚Äúwinging‚Äù too. The PT doctor told me that it‚Äôs winging because the muscles are weak and I need to work to strengthen them to fix the crunching and minimizing the knots I get around my scapula. She also highly encouraged me to go back to the neurologist because she‚Äôs worried that the reason my left shoulder is doing so poorly is due to the nerve damage on the left side of my body. She seems to think there‚Äôs a decent amount of connection with all the nerve issues I‚Äôm experiencing but can‚Äôt diagnose me or confirm that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs going on- just something she‚Äôd suggest I see a specialist for. 

I feel a little happy because so many practitioners that I‚Äôve seen make me feel crazy when I tell them how much my body hurts and how tired I am and that my body is doing weird things and they don‚Äôt have answers so they don‚Äôt even try. 

When I was in my 20s I kept hearing ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too young to be experiencing xyz‚Äù and as soon as I hit 30, the same people are saying ‚Äúwelcome to your 30s!‚Äù 

I am tired of feeling goofy when I seek care or assistance. I want answers but it‚Äôs so hard to work up the courage when you‚Äôre told you‚Äôre fine because the basic tests come back fine. 

I don‚Äôt think having nerve damage on an entire side of my body is fine or normal, but I‚Äôm not a medical professional, so‚Ä¶

Mike the only one that noticed and Lucy to make a decision. They ended up catching up with the group and walking the whole way to the coffee shop. 

January: Lucy and Mike become closer because they bond over their shared hatred of their new professor. Mike even starts waiting for Lucy to leave her desk to walk with her to lunch, much to Lucy‚Äôs confusion. 

March: Lucy gets in a car crash on the way to class. Mike is sympathetic to her. A week later, Lucy spills coffee over her desk in class, he helped her clean her desk. Their relationship is likely more distant., He has super annoyed when he wants to talk to another girl alone and Lucy comes. 

April: Lucy distances herself, but she still tries to be friendly to him. Luke is still a bit standoffish. 

May: the class celebrates Mike‚Äôs birthday. Half the class brings my gifts or food for his potluck. But Lucy doesn‚Äôt even so much just say happy birthday to him. Are we gonna a half later, it‚Äôs Lucy‚Äòs birthday. Two must the class surprise, Lucy, the introvert of the class invites everyone to her party. Mike is one of the few people who agreed to come.

1hcd3or,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hcd3or/aita_for_asking_my_roommates_to_pay_my_rent_after/,AITA for asking my roommates to pay my rent after they refuse to let me sublet my room?,"this is long so bear with me. 

For context, I am (F21) studying at a Canadian university and live in a student apartment building near the school. I have 2 roommates both F20, and I signed a **group lease** with them in May. Rent is 1**000$ a month**. I took over the lease from one of their friends who was their previous roommate. 

When I was signing the lease with them, they were very adamant on meeting me in person multiple times and going to have coffee with me to get to know me. I understood at the time and liked that they cared about getting to know each other before I moved in. Before I signed the lease, I was informed by the previous girl that I should have **no issue subletting my room during the summer** (I was not going to be there in the summer and it is a one year lease), however, once I signed and informed my new roommates that I was planning on putting the room up for sublet, **they refused**. They said they were not comfortable with having a stranger living in their space while they were also away for the summer. And while I totally understood, I also did not have the money to pay for rent all summer. I pleaded with them to please come to some kind of compromise and have some understanding for my situation. They did not and refused again. I could do nothing more, and spent the whole summer working my ass off **paying rent for a place I was not even living at**. Whatever, shit happens, and I literally had no power in this situation, since in our lease it states that **all roommates have to agree to the sublet**. 

Fast forward to the fall semester. Everything was going great. They are two friends, so I knew right away getting into the lease that I would be somewhat alienated, which is exactly what happened. I felt like I tried everything to accommodate them and be nice to them and make them comfortable, while they kind of just acted like they owned the place. (we all split rent equally btw) One of the roommates even wouldn't let me have my cousin visit me for a few days because she already had her boyfriend visiting during that time and claimed that it would get too crowded in the apartment, acting as if she has the final say on whether or not my family can come stay in MY ROOM that I PAY FOR in our shared apartment. 

Sometime in September I realized I actually **hate the city** I'm studying in and **want to move back home**. I was really unhappy there the year before too but was hoping that living in a new place would turn things around; nope. I let my roommates know that I was going to be looking for a subtenant starting January. They said sure no problem, just to try to find someone that was around their age. No problem, **I will try**. A couple weeks later, when I was 100% that I was leaving, one of the roommates, we will call her Sarah, lets me know that an acquaintance of hers is looking for a place for January. I told Sarah to tell this girl to contact me so we could figure things out. I also told Sarah that I was going to post the room on Kijiji and Marketplace to get interest on the sublet ASAP. Sarah tells me to wait for said girl, we will call her Emma, before posting anything because both Sarah and other roommate (we will call her Jenna) would rather live with someone they somewhat know. I was ok sure thinking that this Emma girl is serious about the room. 

I spent the next month in touch with this Emma girl, but she would take forever to answer. By that point, it was almost November and nothing was signed yet. Emma just never answered me again, so I finally posted the room on Kijiji and Marketplace. I was a bit pissed because I literally waited to post the room per Sarah's request because she told me Emma would take the room. But then, Emma was completely unreliable! 

I spent all of November getting a couple messages here and there from a few different people. When I would tell Sarah and Jenna, they would **always find some reason why someone was not a good fit**. Ex: they were not studying similar things as them, they were a bit older than them, they were an international student,... Keep in mind that there were a lot of apartments available for sublet and not many people who were looking to sublease. I did not have the luxury to be picky here because if I didn't answer someone's text fast enough, they would just go with someone else's room. I eventually found a girl (Naomi) who seemed perfect and very interested and everything was supposed to work out. Last week (it is now December), she cancelled on me due to some personal issues and her not being able to move to this city anymore. Really fkn sucked because both Sarah and Jenna liked her and there were no issues. 

Obviously, at that point **I'm freaking out**. It is December, I'm leaving in a week to go home and I still don't have anyone to sublet my room to. On top of that I have the stress of packing all my stuff to move AND study for all my final exams. So, on the same day that Naomi cancelled on me, another girl messaged me, interested in the room (let's call her Hannah). Hannah is 27 and a phD international student. I planned a call immediately with her to give her a virtual tour of the apartment and let her meet my roommate Sarah, as Jenna already went back home for Christmas break. Hannah seemed very kind and responsible. I talked to Sarah afterwards and told her that I know her age is not ideal, but right now it's the only option I have in the short time, and that I will have to go with her for the sublet. Sarah didn't seem too happy because it was very sudden, but she seemed to understand that considering the circumstances I don't have the time to find someone else as this was literally **my only option**. I told her that I cannot afford to once again pay rent for 4 months while I am not living here. I texted roommate Jenna to let her know what was happening. **Jenna refused**. She said that living with a 27y/o will not work for her and makes her very uncomfortable. I told her I understood, but that I literally don't have another option and that it's university living and sometimes things like this happen. I told her she can take the time to get to know Hannah over the Christmas break after papers are signed, that age is really just a number, and that I'm sure once she gets to know her it will be great. I know a bunch of people in their 20s who live with people of all ages and there are rarely issues. That's what university living with roommates is!! 

So, I have been going back and forth now with Sarah and Jenna about this. **Both of them now refuse and claim that their parents are not comfortable with them living with a stranger**. And, while I get it, literally anyone I find for a subtenant will be somewhat of a stranger, giving me no option for any subtenant, forcing me to pay 4000$ while I am not here. I tried a million times to plead with them to try to understand that there is a lot at stake for me if this sublease doesn't work out. They still are **unable to have compassion for me**. I lost my patience at some point and told them that if they will just refuse and not even provide me with some type of compromise or solution, then **they can pay my rent**. However, they have every right not to pay my rent. I have tried to plan FaceTime calls with the possible new girl Hannah to get to know her, but they are just being so complicated with everything. Now they claim that all they asked of me was to meet potential subletters ***in person***. They had never previously mentioned that to me. I don't see much of a difference with meeting someone in person vs meeting them on a FaceTime and having a conversation with them. If it were for dating purposes or something, okay I get it. But this is literally just a university sublet??!! 

They have just been so unhelpful and not compassionate of my situation and I feel like I am being ganged up on not just by them, but by their parents too. Their parents are mad at me now for springing this on everyone at the last minute, when Jenna and Sarah know that I've been trying to figure this out all semester and **have been doing everything to accommodate them**. Their parents are also angry that I am ""trying to make their daughters' living situation uncomfortable in the winter term, and that they don't want their daughters stressed out living with someone they don't know"". Most people I know who are university students literally moved in with strangers, including me my first year. That is what university living is. So I just don't get why they are being so complicated about this. While I would obviously want them to feel comfortable living with someone, it is also only for 4 months. They haven't even given it a chance to get to know the girl. It just feels like they are doing everything to make this a million times harder for me. They are acting like it makes them so scared and stressed to live with someone they haven't met (**who they will get to know**). And when I try to express to them that I have a lot more to lose here (**4000$!!!!**) than them who might be a bit uncomfortable while they get to know their new roommate, they literally are unable to put themselves in my shoes. 

I asked them if, since their parents have such an issue with me subletting, they are going to pay for my rent, and they said nothing. I got quite upset with them and said that they are pushing me into a corner here with literally no solution and forcing me to pay 4000$ just because they aren't able to grow up and get out of their comfort zone for a second. 

**AITA for being upset at this and exploding at them??**

 Does anyone know of any **legal loopholes** to get out of this lease or maybe even take them to court for not allowing me to sublease? I'm not too sure how this all works.

I'm trying to figure out a way to use it because he really wants us to, but I don't know how and the manual is pretty barebones.

If I use milk in it, do the contents need throwing out at the end of every day? We are an incredibly low volume store so I'm trying not to waste product especially milk, but I tried throwing hot water and chocolate powder mix with chocolate pellets and it kind of separated. Tbh even if I do make a regular hot chocolate mix I don't think it'll be thick enough for what he wants to use it for, I think it has to be at least a syrup consistency.

Also, do you keep it on forever? I don't want to blow up the store overnight, but I don't know how else to stop it from clogging if we have to put melted solid chocolate in it.

Our normal hot chocolate method is a little bit of chocolate powder and hot water in the cup, and then steaming milk chocolate pellets and milk together (the coffee machine supplier said this was totally fine for the steam wand if we purge it enough).

Would love suggestions based on my preferences!,"Just saw a post with this same flavor of question, so I figured I'd shamelessly copy that person.

About me:

Divorced 33M, work remote for a tech company (I can live anywhere in continental US). I make 130k/yr and have around 160k between my investments and savings. No kids or partner currently.

I like to be outside as much as possible. Some of my favorite hobbies are hiking, trailrunning, disc golf, snowboarding, camping, paddleboarding.. that sort of stuff. Some of my favorite non-nature activities are playing music, going to local shows, hanging out at coffee shops and bars/breweries, reading, playing video games, and board game nights.

Weather-wise, I don't like heat or humidity. But I also don't love frigid bone-chilling cold. I don't mind rain or snow (in fact, I prefer it). Mountains, water, and interesting geography are important to me.

I don't need to live in a city per se (though a walkable urban center would be great! at least in this stage of my life), but I do at least want some ""city-esque"" amenities, meaning close vicinity to mom and pop shops, coffee shops, bars, and ideally in a neighborhood with some character. I hate strip mall suburbs (I spent a few years in Phoenix.. let's just assume I want the polar opposite of everything that god-forsaken city has to offer).

Not sure if this matters but, I describe myself as an outgoing introvert. I can strike conversation, I'm not shy, and don't have social anxiety, but I'm not much of a small talker. I prefer to keep to myself, unless if I'm in the company of friends or folks who want to have intellectually stimulating conversation, in which case I can talk your ear off :)

Politically, I'm a left-leaning moderate. I have friends all across the spectrum. Politics aren't super important to me, but social liberalism is a big bonus for wherever I decide to move.

Despite my divorce, I do still want to remarry and have a family someday. So in the most ideal circumstances, I want to move somewhere that offers all of the above, but also would serve as a good place to raise kids.

Which brings me to my last point - I do need to live close-ish to a city. I work remote, but as many know, the tech sector is extremely volatile, and should things go south and I can't find another remote job, I can't be living in the sticks. Maybe this means a small city within a bigger metro area. I can figure this out when the time comes.

I really hope that this can clear up some confusion and people can refer to it later. Please let me know if there was some sort of factor or flaw I overlooked when I was putting together the data in this post. More than anything this is meant to be informational.

Everyone deserves the freedom to love who they want, nobody deserves hate for their choice and nobody ""owns"" anyone else. Full stop.

I will only be speaking to what patterns data shows, not why they occur. I also only looked at more recent data collected to make it more relevant. This only applies to the U.S.

A quick caveat regarding American Community Survey data, though I would consider it reputable since it is a poll it is not exact, however; the general trends that the ACS data shows should still be valid.

I did not bother to do my own original analyses because I don't feel like putting in that amount of effort into this, and I have no experience in R only python and matlab, so this is largely a compilation of the work of mainstream institutions such as the U.S. Census Bureau and the abovementioned ACS.

As further justification, I include the analysis of one person who pulled data about 38 million people so while I could try and replicate everything, it would be a little time consuming.

The oxford study is stupid. I don't like to look at other random ass sources since it ain't super rigorous and you can always spin data to serve an agenda.

  
TLDR:

* By sheer quantity, Asian Women/White Men were the 3rd most common marriage (11% of all intermarriage) after non-Hispanic White with Hispanic of either sex (22/20%).
* They outnumber the sex flipped pairing by a factor of 2.5 even today.
* Intermarriage rates between Asians and other racial groups have stayed largely static the past 15 years.
* South Asians intermarry with other racial groups (White, Black, Latino) less than East Asians.
* U.S. Born Asians always intermarry with other racial groups (White, Black, Latino) more than foreign born.
* Normalizing for age, personal income quartile, occupational categories, metropolitan status, and state of residence, East Asian Women are more likely to marry White than their Male counterparts, but not necessarily Black or Latino
* Normalizing for population, Asian Men are less likely to cohabit with someone of the opposite sex than Asian Women.
* In online dating, straight and gay Asian men and women are relatively more likely to respond to White Men and Asian Women over their same/opposite sex counterparts.
* South Asians tend to have the least number of casual relationships and sex partners in college normalizing for various factors.
* East Asians display the opposite trend from all other racial groups in college relationship, hookup, virginal status and sexual partners (The men of other racial groups tend to be more sexually liberated than their female counterparts). The groups are White, Black, Latino, E/SE Asian, South Asian. Normalized for various factors.

# Part 1 Intermarriage

Before really starting, an important assumption to make is equal numbers of men and women, which is only partially true. There are slightly more Asian Women than Men in the country, so counting only those above 18, according to The Asian Alone or in Combination Population in the U.S. 2023 by the U.S. Census Bureau, table 16 (ac23tab16.xls) total Asians are 18,632,000, men being 8,959,000 (48%) and women being 9,673,000 (52%). So for a rough normalization, you can divide the men's stats by 0.96 and the women's by 1.04. Someone who is better at statistics could probably tell me if I'm doing this wrong.

Starting off with the oft quoted Pew Research, the most common intermarriage in the U.S. (by quantity in 2014/2015) is Hispanic with White, including white passing Hispanic. 

Because of how Hispanic was defined as an ethnicity rather than race in the ACS data collected at the time, this includes white passing Hispanics from Spanish speaking countries such as Spain or white Hispanics from South and Central America (who are also racially diverse!) i.e. a white Hispanic from Spain with a non Hispanic white person counts as intermarriage.

The second most common is Asian/White. Breaking it down by gender we can see that Hispanic/White is the first and second most common with either gender and third most common by quantity is Asian Women and White Men at 11% with the other Asian pairings of Asian Men and White Women at 4%, and then 2%/1% for HMAW and AMHW respectively.

Again the white pool does not include the white Hispanic population.

Looking at overall from all races we find the men except for white people overall date out at similar rates, though I would caution this data should not be compared as is with regards to race without normalizing the population between races. The differences in between men/women of each race is minimal enough to ignore for a direct comparison.

Additionally note this is for **newlyweds** in 2014/2015 not overall.

https://preview.redd.it/4a6wlyyjs96e1.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=94f4c9c8f413545892f9efc9a20b924f65113136

According to Pew, ""among Asian newlyweds, these gender differences exist for both immigrants (15% men, 31% women) and the U.S. born (38% men, 54% women).""

**That quote above is likely where people get the 38%/54% rate from.**

  
Some of you may be saying, but Alula\_Australis, we know all this, this is old data and things probably changed! Additionally this is only a snapshot!

Alright, borrowing the work of @cremieuxrecueil all the way up to 2022 I present the data below which consists of a pool of 37,940,658 people:

[Also note that this is newlyweds.](https://preview.redd.it/ngeytn2x2a6e1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5cd95463238b82de40c719a055fcb6d88b4f155)

The so commonly cited Pew data is only a snapshot, @cremieuxrecueil accumulates data from the U.S. Census and ACS.

The above data is for newlyweds, not all.

It largely matches up with the Pew data except for a very slight decrease in the interracial rates for some demographics due to the inclusion of data from older years. If we look at all the interracial marriages:

https://preview.redd.it/huifw2ds3a6e1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c638abdd99f5bb578177655724ddfadc2bb8495

We find that overall interracial marriage is occurring at a higher rate than historically. That is to say, its going up. The ratios have stayed largely similar **except** for Asian men who have closed the gap from a ratio of 1:2.5 to about 1:2 of AM to other against AW to other.

Please note that all of @cremieuxrecuei datacrunching only includes heterosexual partnerships, you can see the full methodology on their blog. I included their blog since it pulls data from reputable sources.

By the raw numbers:

WMAW = 902K

WMBW = 265K

BMWW = 477K

BMAW = 50K

AMWW = 294K

AMBW = 13K

Total of All Interracial Marriages = 3,547K

I confirmed the values in the tabfg3-all.xls from the monthly U.S. Census Current Population Survey which I found out about from user My-Own-Way 's post [https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/xwxml4/us\_oppositesex\_married\_couple\_family\_groups\_2021/](https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/xwxml4/us_oppositesex_married_couple_family_groups_2021/) 

That data is from 2021 though it should be close enough to the 2022 total analyses that @cremieuxrecuei did to still be reliable.

I find that data on all intermarriages to not be helpful since we are more interested in what happens now and it won't show whether the marriages are trending up or down, only the accumulation of them. So these graphs below are newlyweds only.

[Men newlyweds](https://preview.redd.it/dradxbe86a6e1.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1a8356bea24cf2ef88f53160321605951c10869)

For Asian men we don't see much difference between 2008 and 2022, the trendline is rather flat or maybe slightly up.

[Women newlyweds](https://preview.redd.it/lowre3dm6a6e1.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8652517a4fd93adc63b2f35192e536e45cff6e0e)

Same for Asian women though maybe trending slightly higher.

In summation, Asian Men had an intermarriage rate of about 19% in 2022 and for Asian Women we have about 38%, which matches with the Pew snapshot in 2015 of 21%/36% for all Asians. I expect if one controlled for only U.S. born, one would see this be much higher.

A common misconception is that say Filipino Man with Indian Woman counts as intermarriage, however for the U.S. Census data as well as ACS, there is no distinction made between Asian ethnicities, all the intermarriage analyses have been strictly between the major groups in the US including Native Americans whose dataset is not shown here. This is true for all analyses in this post (including Pew) unless otherwise noted.

If you wanted to break it down though:

[For Men, not including NA, mixed, other](https://preview.redd.it/ryk1vqujaa6e1.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&s=631015a42a633d767ca41145603d29d7339ec44c)

And then for women:

[For Women, not including NA, mixed, other](https://preview.redd.it/iqi3llddaa6e1.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&s=edd5a823c782c570ec420871cd1adfecb95a39f7)

Asians actually marry both Hispanics and Black/AAs at comparable rates regardless of sex, the huge disparity exists in newlyweds to white SOs by a factor of more than 2.

  
So far all this has been for all Asians including South Asians who typically face a different set of expectations and stereotypes in the U.S. than E/SE Asians and except for the one stat about U.S. Born vs. Foreign Born from Pew, these analyses have not made a distinction. The data I could find for these was a little bit older but I believe given that the overall rates have been fairly static the past 15 years, the data I'm about to show should still hold relatively true.

Twitter user @tcjfs (now defunct) did an analysis on ACS data (which remember is from polls and less precise than U.S. census data though still largely accurate), which breaks down who is marrying who by ethnicity.

[Some of these datasets are small, but the trends should generally be true, if you add them up it  matches the Pew data](https://preview.redd.it/ooxmfad7da6e1.jpg?width=611&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=881f93e8fbc0a5a258808451e95f66bff3dc9f1c)

This is for all people from the ACS data from several years which about matches the 21%/36% from Pew for all Asians. Including only the data for U.S. born:

[Same as above but for U.S.](https://preview.redd.it/sgqbeodtda6e1.jpg?width=626&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdb1dee9aa52c73916c69896f3e06bdb93a049be)

So for example, from my ethnicity which is Korean looking only at White/Black/Hispanic/Other, we can see from U.S. born Men marry out at a rate of about 42.5% (we ain't counting other Asians) whereas the women do so to about 53.5%.

Discounting those datasets which are insanely small, we can say about the highest rates of intermarriage (not counting other Asians) approaches 55% in many Asian ethnicities or more, particularly for the Japanese who have been here longer and tend to be (to make a generalization) much more Americanized/have undergone more historical trauma with the Japanese Concentration Camps.

U.S. Born Asians pretty much always out-marry more for both sexes (defining it as Black/Latino/White/Other), and Asian Women always out-marry more for both U.S. and foreign born except for South Asian Demographics.

I found data for Indian Americans (sorry it was harder to find it for Pakistani/Nepalese/Sri Lankan etc.) from [https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2021/06/social-realities-of-indian-americans-results-from-the-2020-indian-american-attitudes-survey?lang=en](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2021/06/social-realities-of-indian-americans-results-from-the-2020-indian-american-attitudes-survey?lang=en)

In short, a 2020 survey found that foreign born IA men out-marry (to any non-Indian including other South Asian) at a rate of 20%, whereas foreign born IA women out-marry at a rate of 10%.

Among U.S. born, IA men out-marry at a rate of 27% while IA women out-marry at a rate of 31%.

Its been noted in other studies that the gap in intermarriage is much less between sexes in South Asians in general, not just Indians. South Asians regardless of U.S. or foreign born also tend to out-marry less than their E/SE Asian counterparts, therefore if you see any stat on Asian intermarriage, you can assume for East/Southeast it will be higher and South it will be lower.

  
So far all data has been fairly raw with little analyses done on it. I found an interesting dissertation by Jess Lee of UC Irvine, the reference is here: Lee, J. (2020). Shifting Boundaries of Asian America: Asian American Intermarriage, Ethnic Heterogeneity, and Race Relations in Contemporary United States.¬†*UC Irvine*. ProQuest ID: Lee\_uci\_0030D\_16300. Merritt ID: ark:/13030/m5n92jxv. Retrieved from [https://escholarship.org/uc/item/60z0x8pv](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/60z0x8pv)

She took a look at the more recent ACS data but controlled for age, personal income quartile, occupational categories, metropolitan status, and state of residence. The exact definitions will be provided at the bottom of this post.

Lots of interesting analyses including those on the differences between children who live in a WMAW v.s. AMWW household but mixed children go beyond the scope of this post even though I would love to include some of the findings. Anyway, the most relevant graphs are as follows:

[For men, interethnic meaning among other Asians](https://preview.redd.it/acchscdrva6e1.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b5dddaa6309ed31dcf875820b073d2e9e7c03f4)

If you wanna see the types of analyses used, (she mainly used one-way ANOVA) as well as the p value calculations, they are detailed in her dissertation.

Again, controlled for age, personal income quartile, occupational categories, metropolitan status, and state of residence for women:

[For women, interethnic meaning among other Asians.](https://preview.redd.it/yqcp8cd3ya6e1.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d358b769e8a2afb844c1d0d1e237fe698a21b41)

  
What can be drawn from this? Controlling for most other factors, Asians experience co-ethnic marriages with other Asians at similar probabilities (maybe slightly more for men depending on ethnicity), the biggest difference is seen in the probability of marriage to white SOs where we see E/SE Asian women being much more likely to do so while South Asians again show little difference between sex and tend to marry within their own ethnicity.

  
But many relationships nowadays aren't about marriage, many people opt not to for various reasons. We will examine that in part 2:

# Part 2 Cohabitation and Other Relationships

I was hesitating on whether to include this section but I realize that most people are getting married later, and since there is often some sort of relationship lead up to marriage, it helps when looking at trends in the younger population.

Please when reading through this section remember not to pass judgement on individuals and that everyone is free to make their own choices. Nobody should feel invalidated in their pursuit of love.

Cohabitation is relatively speaking a very small part of all relationships for any racial group, so this mostly applies only to a few people. This data is taken from the U.S. Census Bureau Current Population Survey 2023, Table UC3 (the tabuc3-all.xls):

Asian Men cohabiting: 319,000

Asian Women cohabiting: 398,000

Asian-Asian: 208,000

Subtracting Asian-Asian from the above we get:

Asian Men/X: 111,000 (34.8%)

Asian Women/X: 190,000 (47.7%)

This data only counts opposite sex relationships and excludes ever-married children under 18. I don't find the relative percentages of Asian/X helpful simply because there are more Asian Women cohabiting, its more helpful to see out of the general men/women population what percentage are Asian.

Asian Men, regardless of pairing, made up 3.4% of 9482 cohabitation pairings whereas Asian Women made up 4.2%. This difference is small enough to try applying the normalization mentioned earlier wrt population, we only care about relative proportions so: 319/8,959 for men = 3.6% of all Asian men cohabit and 398/9673 = 4.1% of all Asian women cohabit. The stats for cohabitation are higher than the stats for intermarriage amongst all Asians, but lower than that of only U.S. Born. Probably as mostly U.S. born Asians cohabit.

Proportionally Asian women cohabit and get married at higher rates than Asian men, both historically and in new relationships.

In regards to dating stats, I'll be borrowing data from the book ""Dating Divide"" by Jennifer H. Lundquist who is a dean/tenured prof. at UMass Amherst in Sociology. If you want to know the full methodology I can copy paste it into the comments but the long and short of it is:

Dataset from a very large dating site was obtained (not disclosed), the only criteria used to select which profiles to display are age, sexual orientation, and a matching score derived from personality questions. This particular site attracts a younger and more educated clientele. The original data set includes approximately nine million registered users worldwide and two hundred million messages. Focus was on those who reside in the twenty largest metropolitan areas in the United States. Excluded users were those who did not send or receive at least one message, who did not upload at least one photograph, who fit the profile of spammer users (e.g., not answering any personality questions, being flagged by other users, having unusual messaging patterns, and being deleted in less than an hour). They excluded daters who indicated they were looking only for casual sex or platonic relationships to ensure that the activities analyzed were related to romantic interests. Indians and Middle Easterners were specified apart from Asians.

The bars depict the relative likelihood of interacting with non-Asian men compared with Asian men among Asian daters, adjusted for other observed characteristics. The lines depict 95 percent confidence intervals. Interacting with an Asian dater is indicated by an odds of 1.0. Anything above 1.0 shows a greater relative probability of contacting or responding to a non-Asian dater than an Asian dater; anything below 1.0 indicates a lesser probability.

I didn't include the other graphs because I'm running out of space and also I did not like the confidence intervals. Additionally:

**This Data is Around 10 Years Old**

However the same is true for most other dating site data, which largely matches up with the data seen here e.g. Coffee Meets Bagel, Tinder, etc.

If anyone knows where to get more recent data then I would love to see it.

Somewhat notably, both Gay Asian Men and Straight Asian Women, normalized for other factors, preferred White men.

Straight Asian Men and Gay Asian Women largely preferred Asian Women, normalized for other factors.

The confidence intervals are all wonky for the gay data likely due to a smaller sample size.

**Overall both gay/straight Asians prefer White Men and Asian Women.**

**This dataset is old, and skews younger, urban, more educated, more liberal, and more affluent.**

Moving onto hookups and more casual relationships, I found it difficult to find data for this, only finding even older data, however as stated earlier due to how static the relative percentages have been for intermarriages, I believe that the general trends should remain the same even if the specifics are not exact.

The [Online College Social Life Survey](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/england/ocsls/questionnaire/)¬†(OCSLS) was a dataset collected by Paula England between 2005 and 2010, to compare White, Black, Latinx, East Asian, and South Asian students. The analyses were done by Emma Patton, Paula England, and Andrew Levine in (https://contexts.org/blog/sexual-attitudes-among-college-students-similarities-between-white-black-latinx-and-asian-students/). From them, the methodology in ""the percents, means, or medians in the graphs below are regression-adjusted to remove any part of racial differences that stems from group differences in age, immigrant status, mother‚Äôs education, whether their parents are still together, school, height, and body mass index (BMI).""

This dataset contained around 20,000 students across 21 universities in the U.S.

[East Asians stand out as the one demographic against the pattern here, all else normalized as explained above.](https://preview.redd.it/s6aa3dq1yb6e1.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ea685b16a36891f0f4cddf2a3e6ef00bd26561e)

South Asians of both sexes are the most conservative of all racial groups whereas East Asians have the one demographic where the men contain more virgins than the women.

Of course intercourse also includes those in committed relationships which we already went over in the data above. So looking just at hookups for casual relationships or ONS:

[The Median is used rather than the mean because the median is less influenced by the few students who reported extremely high numbers of hookups.](https://preview.redd.it/ndyzuchjyb6e1.png?width=589&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e1d94b664116a0421208e3e7e178612f7bea3cd)

Now you may be asking why the median is not a whole number. This is because several regressions were done on them as explained earlier in order to account for other demographic data such as immigrant status, age, etc.

South Asians reported slightly higher numbers of hookups than East Asians.

East Asians in hookups display the same pattern as the graph above regarding sex, or at the very least, display the closest gap between sexes of any other racial category in a college setting. Hookups do not always mean sex however, so to further clarify:

[This is mostly just a combination of the above two graphs.](https://preview.redd.it/e9fzbukgzb6e1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=c06e7f2b52f6021a8722207895ac08afbbdb3970)

Here what we notice is that for South Asians, they tend to avoid sex outside of being exclusive (though not always hookups in comparison to East Asians) whereas for East Asians, again the same pattern seen earlier also manifests here.

To finish it off, here are the stats for number of intercourse partners:

[Again median was used to remove extreme outliers](https://preview.redd.it/zo1zl15k1c6e1.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=036a1cf5b1657d9de59d30aa7471c590b6ccab38)

  
The same pattern again holds and we find that South Asians on average have the least number of partners for both sexes with East Asians coming in close second with the same pattern reversion.

Again take this with a grain of salt as:

**This data generally reflects the university attending crowd i.e. younger, affluent, liberal.**

**This data is also old.**

# Part 3 Common Misconceptions

The above sections were basically all data, really this section is about common things I see/hear that can be refuted with the above data.

1. There are more Asian Women than Asian Men in the U.S.
   * This one is true, but it doesn't explain the disparity, copy-pasted from above: There are slightly more Asian Women than Men in the country, so counting only those above 18, according to The Asian Alone or in Combination Population in the U.S. 2023 by the U.S. Census Bureau, table 16 (ac23tab16.xls) total Asians are 18,632,000, men being 8,959,000 (48%) and women being 9,673,000 (52%). So for a rough normalization, you can divide the men's stats by 0.96 and the women's by 1.04. Someone who is better at statistics could probably tell me if I'm doing this wrong.
2. Disparities are explained by ""War Brides"" and Foreign Wives/ Older couples
   * This one is partially false, while more Asian women are in the U.S. because of this, this is largely the older generation, more newlyweds among foreign born Asian Men and Women is with other Asians versus U.S. born newlyweds where more are to other racial categories (mainly White).
3. Disparities are explained by overseas (Confucian) Asian cultures being propagated in the U.S.
   * Likely false, while largely unprovable, we can make an attempt by assuming 1. that those who are foreign born carry more of this culture, 2. ""Confucian"" being aligned with patriarchy and conservatism, therefore 3. Those in such cultures would out-marry to more liberal demographics.
   * We see in Misconception 2. that point 1. does not align with this idea, foreign born Asians out-marry less.
   * Point 3 can be tested by expecting Asian Women to marry out more than Asian Men to liberal demographics which we find is not true as they prefer the most conservative U.S. demographic (White men from Jess Lee's analysis) while marrying at a similar rate as Asian men to their Black and Latino counterparts.
   * Finally using CNN exit polls, **Asian Women voted for Trump at higher rates than Asian men and voted for Biden and Harris at lower rates than Asian men in both elections which goes against every other racial category present including Other, Latino, White, and Black.** The numbers in 2020 were 63% MfB (Asian Men for Biden), 58% WfB and for the 2024, 55% MfH, 54% WfH. For Trump,  2020: 28% MfT, 40% WfT. In 2024 with Harris: 37% MfT, 42% WfT.
   * One could also make the argument with South Asian demographics and more conservative cultures there not lining up with much lower rates of intermarriage in the U.S., however I am not qualified to speak on that issue.
4. Intermarriage rates are explained by interethnic marriages with other Asians
   * False, all the Pew Data as well as ACS generally refer to interracial and specify when interethnic with other Asians does occur. When it does, it happens more with East Asian Men and it overall occurs at vastly lower rates in comparison to intermarriages with mostly White but sometimes Latino and Black people.
5. Disparities are explained by White Women discriminating against Asian Men
   * This one is partially true, however exploring rates of intermarriage, Asian men tend to be relatively comparable to other MoC. Dating data also suggests more than just an out-group discrimination against Asian men, **there is also an in-group discrimination against Asian men by both Gay Asian Men and Straight Asian Women**

# Part 4 Closing Thoughts

I really wish I could take the time to actually do an original analysis but as explained above I have neither the time nor the skill in stats and R to make it worth it. I also came across other various sources that didn't make the cut such as [https://www.asian-nation.org/interracial2.shtml](https://www.asian-nation.org/interracial2.shtml), or the Tinder stats or original journal articles. Why did I not include them? 1. Not mainstream. 2. Biased. 3. Old data. 4. I have a life.

I tried to keep it as relevant and up to date as possible (though obviously I could do better).

I know that oftentimes data is not really persuasive, its more about stirring up emotions and weaving together some sort of narrative that really moves people. I know I personally hate seeing all the vitriol around this subject. I just hope that this post is able to serve as an informative base to work off of. Partially I made it for my own self reference.

This data isn't about taking sides, nobody should be bashing anyone else, what I wanted to see from this community is more why these patterns occur and how all Asians can reexamine and reevaluate their worldview based on this rather than anecdotes and anger.

For other analyses I would be interested in seeing the rates at which U.S. born Asians discriminate against other minority populations normalized for age, income, education, etc. as I believe this is an issue everyone can work on.

Please let me know your thoughts or any criticisms or suggestions you have.
