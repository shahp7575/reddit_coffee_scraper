I 30F have been living with my housemate 29M for 8 months now. It’s a very small 2bed 2 bathroom apartment. I have been living here for 2 years and I am the main lease holder, organise all bills and communication with property manager, own all appliances and furniture and because of this, I have the car port and the slightly bigger room. I pay the WiFi bill and streaming services to make it more fair, and everything else is split (this will be somewhat relevant later). We have become really great friends since he moved in with me, we would usually take a couple of time out of  our busy schedule to catch up and chat, or just watch a movie once a week, and I value him so much as a friend/housemate and have never had a complaint about him until now. 

He was your stereotypical single male, and regularly had a girl come over, but it never interrupted my life at home, so I didn’t care. We had a chat about having friends and guests over before he moved in and it was always respected until recently. Our rule was to always let the other person know if we were bringing a guest over, and to not have people here constantly so that we could respect each other’s space. It’s that small of an apartment where you’d know if there’s an extra person here.

He has just started seeing this girl, and the three times I’ve met her, I was never notified by her coming over. The first two times he apologised, and the 3rd he never said anything, and she stayed the night until he to work in the late afternoon the next day. This was all in the space of a week or so. I go out of town for 3.5 weeks on the 3rd time that I meet her. I come back home once during that time for a couple of hours and see that she has basically moved in. I thought ok, he knows I’m not here, whatever. Not that big of a deal. While I was away, he text me how excited he was for me to come back as he missed me around the house and I said the same as I was having a horrible time where I was and I couldn’t wait for a full nights sleep at home. He saw where I was staying and it really was bad and he sympathised with me the whole way through and always checked in on me (I couldn’t sleep much in those 3.5 weeks). 

On my first night back, I notice there’s no longer any space for my shoes as she has hers taken up the whole area, her things are everywhere in the pantry and kitchen, I’m finding her hair in my bathroom, which is weird as it’s en-suite, my shows on tv were many episodes ahead/behind, some of my towels are gone from my shelf in the cupboard, and I’m like ok just ignore it - it’ll be different now I’m home. 

He comes home that night and the girl follows directly behind him. I’m furious. No notice, once again. They say hi and he tries to have small chat with me but I’m not in the headspace as I was soaking up the comfort of my own space and trying to relax and unwind. I do not know this girl and had to sit up and “perform” for a guest. They eventually go into his room and he comes out to get them a drink, I said a few small talk bits with him and then said hey, btw I really do not want a third housemate in a jokey way and he said what, no she has her own place? And laughed it off. I thought ok, surely that was enough for him to get the message. I try to go to sleep because I have work early in the morning, which he knew. They then both kept me awake until 1am laughing and talking in full volume with no consideration to me being there. I didn’t want to text because I was so mad that the night of relaxation I was so desperately needing was ruined, and I feared I was overreacting in the heat of the moment. 

I get over myself and calm down by the morning. I go to work, come back and he follows in shortly after. I suggested we have a catchup and he looks at his phone and said oh sorry, *** is here. She’s coming up now. And that’s where I speak up properly. I explained that I know things have probably changed for both of you while I was away, but I’m back home now and I really need space, and I wouldn’t be comfortable with her being here every night especially when I don’t know her yet (btw she’s never made an actual effort to talk, she bolts to his room mid convo, or just stands there), and I mentioned that I was upset that you never gave me the heads up that you were having *** over last night especially when you knew that I really needed the time to unwind and you guys kept me awake. Anyway, he apologised and completely agreed with me and said he’s already had a chat with her about me coming back but will talk to her again and he is finding it hard having to consider me being back now and that he would have a chat with her again. 


Since the conversation he has withdrawn completely from me which I’ve given him the space to do so, as I know sometimes people can take time to adjust after these types of conversations. It’s now been a 3ish weeks - a month. He received it so well at the time and gave me a massive hug and it was properly talked through. He’s no longer chatting to me as a friend, or having any form of contact that isn’t necessary and is just really moody with me. He is also not staying in the house when I’m there. He also isn’t really sleeping here either. 

 I went to his work place 3 days ago, which is something that we’d do on the regular for each other with a coffee. I asked him was everything okay, and he gave me a generic reply like yeah works been pretty crap and he was just super cold toward me. He’d usually give me a full run down of the most minor things going on in his life. I said okay, I was worried that you were mad at me after our conversation and wanted to clarify that I would love to get to know her and suggested dinner together and she is of course welcome to come over and stay etc. He said absolutely not to being mad at me and again stated that he was wrong. He then said that even though they only know each other a very short amount of time, they’re looking for a place together as they got used to it when I was gone and they really enjoyed it. I left his work on good terms but it still felt extremely awkward. I know now that I’m needing to take an even bigger step back and maybe realise we’re not friends anymore? 


Then bills came out two days ago, they always come at the same time of the month, and he has always paid on time. I screenshot them to him and he pays his half. He sent me a snappy message when I sent them this time and he has not sent his share yet. 

I got home today from work and my Lillie’s that I had in a vase were moved from the kitchen island to outside in the sun where they have died and I’m so upset about it. I know that she has been in the house today because there’s been 2 of everything left on the draining board. I’m hoping she has allergies and it’s wasn’t done maliciously by either of them. 

I don’t know what to do from here. Have I overreacted/under-reacted? ",1,1751018981.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False

One of the senior guys I used to freelance with is married and has a kid. But whenever he comes to my city, he always calls me ahead of time and asks to meet. During his trips, he treats me to fullcourse meals at fancy restaurants, sometimes the whole day. Even when he gets back to his hotel late at night, he still calls and invites me for a quiet dinner because he “wants to talk.”
When he's back in his own city, he randomly messages me about what he's doing or sends me photos of his coffee. He also keeps asking about my love life and when I’ll get married, even though I’ve told him I’m not interested in dating or marriage.
He’s even called me out of the blue when visiting other cities and asked me to come there too. I honestly can’t tell if he’s joking or serious.
Once, he came with his family and they asked to meet me. He introduced me to themwhich surprised me, since I’ve seen him not even introduce his own colleagues. Since he didn’t have a car when he visited my city, I drove them to their hotel. He and his kid sat in the back, and his wife sat beside me. On the way, his kid said something like “Daddy keeps looking at this woman,” and he brushed it off like “don’t talk nonsense.” I didn’t turn to see, but I think the kid meant me.
I’m confused. What is he doing? And why? Is this normal? Am I overthinking it?

1llq5a7,https://youtu.be/tR7kJEYwXvU,3 Very Scary TRUE Motel Room Mystery Horror Stories,"# ""The Crawlspace"":

I’d been driving for hours, my eyes burning from staring at the endless highway. My hands ached from gripping the wheel, and my back was stiff from sitting too long. A flickering neon sign up ahead read “Rest Easy Inn.” The motel looked like it hadn’t been touched in decades—paint peeling off the walls, windows smudged with grime, and only a couple of cars in the cracked parking lot. I didn’t want to stop, but I was too tired to keep going. I pulled in, my tires crunching on loose gravel, and parked near the office. The engine ticked as it cooled, and I sat for a moment, trying to shake the heaviness in my limbs.The office door was heavy, its glass cloudy with age. A bell above jingled weakly as I stepped inside. The air smelled of stale cigarettes and old coffee. A man stood behind the counter, middle-aged, with greasy hair slicked back and a faded flannel shirt stained with what looked like ketchup—or something worse. His eyes flicked up from a yellowed ledger, sizing me up like I was a package he was deciding whether to accept.“Need a room?” His voice was low, raspy, like he smoked too much. He didn’t smile, just stared, his fingers tapping the counter.“Yes, please,” I said, my throat dry. I forced a polite nod, though my skin crawled under his gaze. “Just for the night.”He grunted, flipping a page in the ledger. “Room 12. Fifty bucks. Cash only.” He slid a key across the counter, its metal cold and scratched. His hand lingered on it, his nails chipped and dirty, before he let go.I fished out the money, my fingers brushing the counter’s sticky surface. “Is there Wi-Fi or a phone in the room?” I asked, hoping for some connection to the outside world.He shook his head, eyes narrowing slightly. “No Wi-Fi. No phone. You got a problem, come to the office.” His tone was flat, like he was reciting lines he’d said a hundred times.I nodded, clutching the key. “Thanks,” I mumbled, turning to leave. The bell jingled again as I stepped out, the sound sharp in the quiet. Room 12 was at the far end of the motel, past a row of faded doors. The building felt too still, like it was holding its breath. My shoes scuffed on the uneven sidewalk as I walked, the key biting into my palm.The door to Room 12 groaned when I unlocked it, the hinges rusted. Inside, the air was thick with a musty smell, like wet carpet left to rot. The room was small—a sagging bed with a thin, faded comforter, a chipped nightstand with a flickering lamp, and a carpet with dark stains that made my stomach turn. A small bathroom sat in the corner, its door half-open, revealing a cracked sink and a shower with a yellowed curtain. On the floor near the bed, I spotted a crumpled rag, stained with something dark, maybe oil or blood. I didn’t want to know. I nudged it under the bed with my foot, my heart beating a little faster.I dropped my bag on the floor and locked the door, sliding the bolt in place. It clicked, but the frame looked weak, like a good shove could break it. I tested the handle, twisting it hard. It held, but I didn’t feel safe. My phone showed no bars, just a blank screen. No signal. I sighed, rubbing my eyes, telling myself it was just one night. I’d be fine.Then I heard it—a soft thump from above. Like a footstep, slow and heavy. I froze, my breath catching. The ceiling was low, covered in cracked plaster. Another thump, this time closer, moving toward the corner of the room. My pulse quickened. It’s an old building, I thought. Probably just pipes or something settling. But the sound came again, deliberate, like someone pacing. I stood, staring up, my neck prickling.I scanned the room, my eyes landing on a vent high on the wall, near the ceiling. It was small, rectangular, its slats caked with dust. Something glinted inside, a tiny flash of light. My stomach twisted. I dragged the dresser over, its legs scraping the carpet, leaving faint trails in the dirt. The wood was heavy, and my arms shook as I positioned it under the vent. I climbed up, balancing on the edge, my fingers gripping the wall. Peering into the vent, I saw it—a small glass lens, barely visible, with a faint red light blinking. A camera.My heart stopped. Someone was watching me. My hands trembled as I climbed down, nearly slipping. I grabbed my bag, my mind screaming to get out. I yanked the door handle, but it wouldn’t move. The bolt was still open, but the door was stuck, like something held it from the outside. I twisted harder, panic rising in my chest. “Hey!” I shouted, banging on the door. “Is anyone there? Open the door!” My voice echoed in the small room, but no one answered.The footsteps above started again, faster now, moving toward the back of the room. I spun around, my eyes darting to the vent. The red light blinked steadily, like an unblinking eye. My breath came in short gasps. I checked the window—small, bolted shut, the glass too thick to break without a tool. My phone was useless, no signal, no way to call for help. The footsteps stopped, and the silence was worse, heavy and suffocating.I had to get out. The vent was my only chance. I climbed back onto the dresser, my legs wobbly, and pried at the vent cover with my nails. It was loose, held by rusted screws. I yanked it off, and it fell to the floor with a loud clang. I winced, listening for any response. Nothing. The opening was tight, but I could fit. I pulled myself up, my shoulders scraping the edges, and crawled into a dusty, narrow space. Cobwebs clung to my face, sticking to my lips. I gagged, wiping them away, my hands shaking. The air was thick, smelling of mold and decay. Splinters pricked my palms as I crawled forward, my elbows banging against the wood.The crawl space stretched on, dark except for a faint glow ahead. I moved toward it, my heart pounding so loud I was sure it would give me away. The glow came from a crack in the floor, light spilling up. I inched closer, lying flat, and peered down. My blood ran cold. Below was a small room, lit by the flickering glow of screens. The clerk sat in a chair, his back to me, staring at a wall of monitors. Each showed a different motel room—empty beds, scattered bags, people sleeping. One screen showed Room 12, my bag still on the floor, the rag peeking out from under the bed. He was watching, his head tilted slightly, like he was studying every detail.I bit my lip to keep from gasping, my hands trembling against the wood. I had to keep moving. The crawl space led to a corner where a rickety ladder descended into darkness. I crawled toward it, every creak of the floorboards making my heart leap. My sleeve caught on a nail, ripping loudly. I froze, holding my breath, waiting for the clerk to turn. He didn’t move, his eyes fixed on the screens.I reached the ladder and climbed down, my hands slipping on the dusty rungs. It led to a back room in the office, cluttered with cardboard boxes, a tipped-over chair, and stacks of old papers. The air was stale, heavy with the smell of mildew. A door to the outside stood slightly ajar, a thin sliver of light cutting through the darkness. I crept toward it, my shoes silent on the concrete floor. My hand grazed a box, and it shifted, revealing a pile of tiny cameras, wires tangled like snakes. My stomach lurched.I reached the door, easing it open, wincing at the faint creak. I slipped outside, the air cool against my sweaty skin. My car was still there, untouched. I glanced back, and my heart stopped. The clerk stood at the office window, staring at me. His face was blank, but a slow, crooked smile spread across his lips, his eyes locked on mine. I ran, my keys slipping in my shaking hands. I fumbled them into the ignition, the engine roaring to life. Tires screeched as I sped out of the lot, the motel shrinking in my rearview mirror.I didn’t stop until I reached a gas station miles away, my hands still trembling as I gripped the wheel. My phone finally showed a signal, and I called the police, my voice breaking as I told them everything—the camera, the locked door, the screens, the clerk’s smile. They listened, asked questions, and promised to check it out.The next day, they called back. They’d gone to the motel, but it was empty. The clerk was gone, the screens dark, the crawl space abandoned. They found the cameras, wires cut, and a few grainy photos in the office, faces blurred. No trace of the man. I still see that smile in my head, every time I close my eyes. I don’t drive alone anymore, and I’ll never stop at a motel again.





# ""Becca’s Last Entry"":

I pulled into the Super 8 Motel off Interstate 40 in Albuquerque, my eyes burning from hours on the road. The neon sign flickered, casting jagged shadows across the cracked asphalt of the parking lot. The building was old, its beige paint peeling in long strips, and the hum of overworked air conditioners filled the air. My car’s engine ticked as it cooled, and I grabbed my duffel bag, slinging it over my shoulder. The front desk was through a glass door smudged with fingerprints, and the lobby smelled of stale coffee, cheap air freshener, and something sour I couldn’t place. The carpet, a faded red, clung to my sneakers with every step, sticky like it hadn’t been cleaned in years.The clerk, a wiry man with dark circles under his eyes, sat behind the counter, his head propped on one hand. His nametag read “Jerry,” but he didn’t introduce himself. He barely glanced up from his phone as he slid a key across the scratched counter. “Room 12,” he muttered, his voice flat, like he’d said it a thousand times. “Second floor, end of the hall.”I nodded, too tired to make small talk, and headed up the creaky stairs. The hallway was narrow, lit by a single flickering bulb that buzzed like a trapped insect. Room 12 was the last door on the left, next to another marked 12A. I noticed 12A’s door was ajar, just a sliver, enough to see a strip of darkness inside. My stomach twisted, a faint warning I brushed off as exhaustion. I turned the key in my lock and stepped into Room 12.The room was small, suffocating, with a heavy musty smell that clung to everything. The bed sagged in the middle, its faded green bedspread dotted with cigarette burns. Thin curtains hung limply over a window that faced the parking lot, letting in slivers of light from the neon sign outside. A dark, uneven stain on the carpet near the bed caught my eye—too large to be coffee, too irregular to be anything innocent. I tried to ignore it, dropping my bag on a wobbly chair. Then I noticed the door on the far wall, connecting to 12A. Its handle was loose, and when I tested it, it swung open with a soft creak.Room 12A was a mirror of mine but felt wrong, like stepping into a memory someone wanted forgotten. The air was thick, heavy with the scent of stale cigarettes and something metallic, like old blood. A suitcase sat in the corner, unzipped, with women’s clothes spilling out—a floral blouse, white denim jeans, a pair of scuffed sneakers. My heart started pounding. Why was this here? Who left it? I stepped closer, my shoes sinking into the carpet, and saw a small notebook tucked under the clothes. Its cover was worn leather, the edges frayed, with “1991” scratched in faint ink.I hesitated, my fingers hovering over it. Something told me to leave it alone, but curiosity won. I opened it, and the pages crinkled, brittle with age. The handwriting was shaky, almost frantic. “June 1, 1991. I can’t stay here long. George knows I’m in Albuquerque. He’s dangerous, more than I realized. He’s selling drugs, and I have proof—names, dates, places. I hid it in my bag. I don’t know who to trust.” The signature at the bottom read “Becca.” My breath caught. I’d heard about a woman found dead in this motel in 1991, her case unsolved, her name unknown for years. Was this her?I flipped to the next entry. “June 3. He’s closer. I saw his truck outside last night, black with a dented fender. I hear footsteps outside my door when it’s dark. I’m scared he’ll find me before I can get to the police.” The final entry, dated June 4, was shorter: “I’m going to the station tomorrow. If anything happens to me, it’s George. He won’t let me ruin him.” That was it. The rest of the pages were blank.My hands shook as I closed the notebook. The room felt colder, the air pressing against my skin. I grabbed my phone to call the police, but the screen showed no signal. I tried the room’s phone, a clunky beige thing on the nightstand, but the line was dead, just a faint crackle. My pulse raced. I crossed to the window and peeked through the curtains. In the parking lot below, a man stood under the neon sign, staring up at my room. He was tall, broad-shouldered, with a shaved head and a tattoo on his forearm. I couldn’t read it, but my gut screamed it was him—George.I locked the connecting door, my fingers fumbling with the bolt, and dragged the dresser across the floor to block it. The wood scraped, loud in the silence. I sat on the bed, clutching the notebook, my ears straining for any sound. A faint creak came from the hallway, then another, like slow footsteps. I held my breath, waiting, but they stopped. The silence was worse, heavy with possibility. I couldn’t stay here.I grabbed my bag and the notebook, determined to find the clerk. The hallway was empty, the bulb still buzzing. Downstairs, Jerry was at the counter, flipping through a magazine, his hands unsteady. “Hey,” I said, my voice sharper than I meant. “I found something in 12A. A diary from 1991. It talks about a woman who died here, someone named Becca. She was scared of a guy named George.”His face went white, and the magazine slipped from his hands, hitting the counter with a soft thud. “That’s not possible,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “Room 12A’s been sealed since… since it happened. Nobody’s been in there. You’re mistaken.”“I’m not,” I said, holding up the notebook. “It was with a suitcase, clothes, everything. It mentions a drug dealer. You know something, don’t you?”He leaned closer, his eyes darting to the door. “Listen,” he whispered. “You need to leave this alone. That case… it’s dangerous. People around here don’t talk about it. Get out of this motel. Now.” His urgency sent a chill through me.I backed away, my heart hammering. “I’m calling the police,” I said, more to myself than to him. I ran back to my room, barricaded the door with the chair, and tried my phone again. This time, I got a signal. I dialed 911, my voice shaking as I told the operator about the diary, the suitcase, the man outside. They told me to stay put, that an officer was on the way.While I waited, I heard it—a soft thump from 12A, like something heavy hitting the floor. Then another, followed by a dragging sound, slow and deliberate. My mouth went dry. I stared at the connecting door, the dresser still pressed against it. The handle rattled, just once, sharp and intentional. I froze, my breath shallow, praying it wouldn’t move again. Minutes dragged on, each one stretching into forever, until I heard sirens outside.The police arrived, led by a Detective Ramirez, a stocky man with a calm voice that didn’t match the tension in his eyes. I handed him the notebook, explaining everything—the open door, the clothes, Becca’s words. He flipped through the pages, his brow furrowing. “This is big,” he said. “We never recovered her personal effects. This could help us identify her.” He looked at me, his tone serious. “You’re lucky you called when you did. This motel’s got a dark history.”They searched 12A, pulling out the suitcase, a few pieces of jewelry, and a crumpled bus ticket from Los Angeles to Albuquerque, dated May 1991. Ramirez told me the woman was Rebecca Smith, found dead in 12A on June 5, 1991. The official report said drug overdose, but suspicion had always pointed to foul play. A man named George Martinez, a known drug dealer, had rented the room. They’d never had enough to pin it on him—until now.I couldn’t stay at the Super 8. I checked into a Holiday Inn across town, the clean lobby and bright lights a stark contrast to the nightmare I’d left. But that night, as I unpacked, my phone rang—a blocked number. I answered, and a low, gravelly voice said, “You should’ve left it alone. You think you’re safe now?” My blood turned to ice. I ran to the window and saw him—the man from the parking lot, standing under a streetlight, his tattoo clear in the glow: “George.” In his hand was a gun, its metal glinting.I dropped the phone and yanked the curtains shut, my hands shaking so hard I could barely dial 911. I told them everything, my voice breaking. Within minutes, police cars flooded the lot, their lights flashing. I watched from the window as they tackled George, pinning him to the ground. He didn’t resist, but his eyes locked on my window, unblinking, until they shoved him into a cruiser.Detective Ramirez called me later. They’d matched the diary’s details to new evidence—a hidden compartment in the suitcase with names and dates of drug deals, enough to tie George to Rebecca’s death. He’d been watching the motel, maybe waiting for someone else to find her things, to silence them too. The case was reopened, and they hoped it would bring closure to Rebecca’s family.I left Albuquerque the next morning, the notebook’s words burned into my mind. Becca’s fear, her courage, her last moments—they haunted me. I kept checking my rearview mirror, half-expecting to see a black truck with a dented fender. I’d uncovered the truth, but at what cost? Every creak of a floorboard, every shadow in a parking lot, makes me wonder if I’ll ever feel safe again.





# ""Dead Man’s Check-In"":

I’m a true crime writer, always drawn to stories that dig into the darkest corners of human nature. When I heard about Room 107 at the Desert Inn Motel, a rundown place on the edge of a small Arizona town, I knew I had to stay there. In 1983, a man was found hanging in that room, his identity a mystery. The police called it a suicide, but locals whispered about murder, about secrets buried with him. I booked a night, my pulse quickening with a mix of excitement and dread, eager to walk where a cold case lingered.The motel was a relic, its neon sign flickering, half the letters burned out. The lobby smelled of stale coffee and old carpet. The clerk, a wiry man with gray stubble and tired eyes, slid the key across the counter. “Room 107, huh?” he said, his voice low. “You sure about this?” I nodded, trying to seem casual. “Just be careful,” he warned, leaning closer. “Some people say that room’s cursed. Guests hear things—scratching, whispers. One guy swore he saw a shadow move.” I forced a laugh, brushing it off as small-town gossip, but his stare didn’t waver. “I’m serious,” he said. “Something’s not right in there.”Room 107 was at the end of a dim hallway, the carpet stained, the walls peeling. The door creaked as I pushed it open. Inside, the air felt heavy, thick with a musty smell that clung to my throat. The room was small: a sagging bed with a faded green bedspread, a chipped nightstand, a single lamp that buzzed when I flicked it on. The mirror above the dresser was smudged, and the bathroom tiles were cracked, stained with rust. I dropped my bag on the floor, the thud echoing too loudly. My skin prickled, like the room was watching me.I couldn’t sleep that night. The silence was oppressive, broken only by the hum of the lamp and the occasional creak of the building settling. Around 1 a.m., I started searching the room, driven by a restless need to find something, anything, tied to the 1983 case. I checked under the bed, finding only dust and a stray sock. I ran my fingers along the walls, tapped the mirror for hidden compartments. Nothing. Then I moved to the nightstand. It was heavy, bolted to the floor. I crouched down, shining my phone’s flashlight behind it. There, taped to the back, was a small, yellowed envelope.My heart raced as I peeled it free. The tape was brittle, crumbling under my fingers. Inside was a photograph, its edges worn, showing a man and a woman smiling in front of a car. The man had short hair and a sharp jaw; the woman looked younger, her eyes bright. Tucked with the photo was a note, written in shaky handwriting: “Meet me at the old warehouse on Main Street at midnight. Come alone.” The ink was faded, the paper creased, like it had been handled too many times. It felt like a relic from the 80s, maybe even from the year the man died. My hands shook. Was this connected to him?The next morning, I walked to the diner across the street, a greasy spoon with checkered floors and chipped mugs. The waitress, an older woman with deep wrinkles and a name tag reading “Doris,” poured my coffee. I slid the photo across the counter. “Do you know anything about this?” I asked. Her eyes widened, and she set the coffee pot down hard. “Where’d you get that?” she whispered, glancing around like someone might hear. I told her about the envelope, about Room 107. She leaned in, her voice barely audible. “That man… he’s the one they found in 107. Police were here for days, asking questions. He had no ID, just some cash and a fake address. They said he killed himself, but folks around here didn’t buy it.” She paused, wiping her hands on her apron. “A woman came looking for him, maybe a year later. Said he was her brother. Cops didn’t believe her. She was frantic, crying, but she left town after that. Never saw her again.”My stomach twisted. “What did she look like?” I asked. Doris squinted at the photo. “Like her, but older. Same eyes.” I thanked her, my mind racing. The note’s mention of the warehouse gnawed at me. It was a lead, but it felt dangerous. I spent the day researching the case on my laptop, finding old newspaper clippings online. The man was a John Doe, described as tall, with a European accent. A metal band and a yellow thread were found near his body, but the police dismissed them as meaningless. No suspects, no motive, no closure.That night, I couldn’t resist. I drove to the old warehouse on Main Street, a crumbling brick building with broken windows and graffiti. My flashlight cut through the darkness as I stepped inside, the air thick with dust and the faint smell of oil. “Hello?” I called, my voice echoing off the walls. My heart pounded so loud I thought it would give me away. A shadow moved in the corner, and I nearly dropped the flashlight. A woman stepped forward, her hair gray, her face etched with lines. It was the woman from the photo, aged by decades. “You found the envelope,” she said, her voice trembling. “I left it there years ago, hoping someone would find it.”“Who are you?” I asked, my throat dry. She clutched a worn purse, her eyes darting to the shadows. “My name’s Clara. That man, Karl, was my brother. He was smuggling diamonds for some dangerous people. I told him to stop, but he wouldn’t listen. I think his partners found him in that room and killed him. Made it look like a suicide.” Her voice broke. “I left the note, hoping someone would dig deeper.” She grabbed my arm, her grip cold. “They’re still out there. They watch that room. You’re not safe.”I drove back to the motel, her words ringing in my ears. The clerk was gone, the lobby empty. In Room 107, I double-checked the lock, but sleep wouldn’t come. Around 3 a.m., my phone rang. No caller ID. I answered, and a low, raspy voice whispered, “Stop digging, or you’ll end up like him.” My blood ran cold. I hung up, but it rang again. Just heavy breathing this time, then a faint chuckle. I unplugged the phone, my hands shaking.The next day, I returned from the diner to find my room trashed. My notebook was torn, pages scattered across the floor. My clothes were pulled from my bag, and the envelope was gone. My chest tightened, panic rising. Someone had been here, watching me. I went to the clerk, my voice shaking. “Someone broke into my room,” I said. He frowned, checking the log. “Nobody’s got a key but me and you,” he said, but his eyes avoided mine. “Maybe you left the door open.” I knew I hadn’t.That evening, a package arrived at the front desk, wrapped in plain brown paper. My name was scrawled on it in black marker. Inside was the stolen envelope, the photo and note untouched, but a new slip of paper was tucked inside: “This is your only warning.” My knees buckled. I wanted to leave, to drive far away, but Karl’s story pulled me back. He deserved justice. I had to be smarter than whoever was watching.I decided to set a trap. I wrote a new note, slipping it into the envelope: “I gave copies of the photo to the police. They know everything.” It was a lie, but I hoped it would scare them. I taped the envelope back behind the nightstand and hid in the closet, the door cracked just enough to see the room. My heart pounded so loud I was sure they’d hear it. I waited, clutching my phone, ready to call for help.Around 2 a.m., the door clicked open. A man in a dark hoodie slipped inside, his flashlight beam sweeping the room. He moved to the nightstand, muttering to himself, “Stupid writer, poking around.” He found the envelope, tearing it open. I held my breath, my body trembling. Then I stepped out, my voice shaking. “Who are you?” He spun around, eyes wide with shock, and lunged at me, his hand grabbing for my throat. I screamed, stumbling back into the wall. The clerk and another guest burst in, drawn by the noise. The man shoved past them, sprinting into the night, but something fell from his pocket—a wallet. I grabbed it, hands shaking, and found an ID inside. The name matched a known figure in a 1980s diamond smuggling ring.I called the police, my voice barely steady. They took the wallet and the envelope, and within days, they arrested three men tied to the old smuggling case. They confessed to killing Karl, staging it as a suicide to cover their tracks. The case was finally closed. I checked out the next morning, my bags packed in a frenzy. As I drove away, the Desert Inn Motel faded in my rearview mirror, its neon sign flickering like a dying pulse. I was safe, but the whispers from that phone call still haunted me: “You’ll end up like him.” I wondered if Karl had left that envelope himself, a final plea for someone to find the truth. I haven’t stayed in a motel since, and I don’t think I ever will.",1,1751018863.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1llq50o,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalLifeHacks/comments/1llq50o/what_really_helps_with_memory_support_for_older/,What really helps with memory support for older adults?,"So I’m 58, and for the last few years I’ve been slowly noticing my brain isn’t quite as fast as it used to be. I still function fine, but the “tip of the tongue” moments? Way more common. Forgetting names, walking into rooms and blanking, repeating stories to friends, all happening more than I’d like to admit.

I got tired of people joking that it’s just “getting older.” So I started looking into **memory support for older adults**, but without going the medication route. Just natural, science-backed methods I could stick with.

Here’s what I found, and what actually made a difference.

**The #1 thing nobody talks about: BDNF decline**

I had never heard of BDNF before this journey. It stands for Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, and it’s basically like fertilizer for your brain. It helps grow new brain cells, strengthens connections, and supports memory and learning.

But the problem is BDNF **drops naturally after 40**, which means your brain’s ability to stay sharp and recall info declines too. That’s where all the memory lapses and brain fog creep in.

**I didn’t want another brain game app. I wanted results.**

Most websites say to play Sudoku or download a brain training app, but studies show those don’t really stop cognitive decline. You just get better at the game itself.

So I started looking for **real memory support for older adults**. Not gimmicks, not superfoods with magical claims, just stuff that made scientific sense.

Here are the 5 things I tried, and what actually helped:

**1. Movement, not just exercise**  
I’m not a gym guy. But I started walking more - 20-30 minutes outside, five days a week. Turns out light cardio **boosts BDNF** and helps your brain form new memory pathways. It doesn’t have to be intense. Just consistent.

**2. Sound-based neural support: Brain Song**  
I found this track called **Brain Song** that claims to use a specific soundwave to stimulate BDNF. I know, it sounds kind of “out there,” but I gave it a shot.

It’s a 17-minute audio track you listen to with headphones. I started playing it mid-morning while relaxing, and after about a week, I honestly noticed I was remembering things faster.

Not dramatic, just small shifts. Like remembering appointment times or recalling a story without pausing to find the words. If you're curious, here's the version I used:  
[**Brain Song memory audio**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2L77PR1Z/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalLifeHacks)

I can’t explain it fully, but it’s supposedly using **neural entrainment** to activate brain regions that influence memory. Whatever it’s doing, I’ll take the improvement.

**3. Blueberries, coffee, and olive oil**  
Turns out some foods actually **help support cognitive function**. I started eating a handful of blueberries in the morning, a spoon of olive oil with meals, and kept my one daily coffee. All are shown to help protect the brain and support memory, especially when BDNF is in the picture.

**4. Less multitasking, more focus**  
This one took effort. I stopped trying to juggle five things at once and instead focused on doing one thing at a time, with full attention. Surprisingly, my memory improved just by slowing down and focusing. Apparently, that also helps encode things into long-term memory better.

**5. The audio track again - yep, it stayed in my routine**  
After a few weeks of consistent listening, I really did feel sharper. I even got compliments from a coworker who said, “You’ve been on point lately!” Small thing, but it made me feel good.

Here’s the second link to the version I downloaded, if you’re wondering:  
[**Try the Brain Song here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2L77PR1Z/?uid=38664&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalLifeHacks)

**Final thoughts on natural memory support for older adults**

If you’re over 50 and starting to feel a little foggy, don’t panic. You’re not alone, and there are things you can do.

What worked for me wasn’t any one magic thing. It was a few consistent changes: walking, eating better, giving my brain space to focus, and surprisingly… listening to a soundwave track I never thought I’d try.

If you’ve found other things that helped your memory feel sharper, I’d honestly love to hear about them. I’m always looking for new ways to keep the brain strong as I get older.",1,1751018836.0,NaturalLifeHacks,0,1.0,False

1llq0f8,https://i.redd.it/qz88t1wd0g9f1.jpeg,r/YouTubeThumbnailHub has BAD ADVICE (yet is a net positive),"Let's address a [recent discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouTubeThumbnailHub/comments/1lliheb/people_do_not_give_good_advice_in_this_sub/) post openly, with love and (maybe) humor.  Buckle up, I tend to get wordy, so a WTL;DR (that's a *Waaaaay TL;DR*) is at the end. 

First, here's some context. U/AfgAzi 's recent post was titled “[People do not give good advice in this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouTubeThumbnailHub/comments/1lliheb/people_do_not_give_good_advice_in_this_sub/)”. The post shouldered a lot of the blame on the mod’s (that’s me) requirement that everyone give two feedback comments to others before they request help for themselves. (I hope that’s a fair summary.)

And a quick note before getting into it. Since I assume that hearing “Creating and growing a subreddit and being its mod is a *tough, thankless job*” earns more eye-rolls than “Amens!”, I won’t say it. (Oops, I just did.)

Let’s start with one of u/AfgAzi’s main points: Requiring ""commenting on two other posts before making your own request will cause people to rush it \[...\] and not give good advice.""

And yeah, this is one of the tougher calls to make while setting up a subreddit.  Should we **force mostly amateurs** to, what, give advice? Yeah. And a lot of that advice will be... well... **bad advice.**

Orrrr, do we remove that rule and let people just *take* and *take* and *take*, without ever giving back? 🤷‍♀️

But here’s the thing: there might be some value to even those YouTuber novices' rushed thoughts!  They are, after all, consumers of YouTube themselves. Maybe something can be gleaned from what a few of them have to say. And if it’s nonsense? That stuff is easy to spot and ignore.

At the very least, they’ve chipped in, contributed a different perspective, and supported fellow creators along the way, even if all the advice isn’t perfect. But here’s the extra magic: their comment increases engagement and boosts visibility, landing the post on the feeds of a larger YouTuber audience around Reddit.

And no, they aren't all amateurs seeking help. Some posts are from people with real experience and are genuinely looking to make compound improvements. 

And from experience, I can tell you the alternative (the no participation requirement) looks like this: A graveyard of unanswered requests. (Seriously, go check out r/thumbnails. No shade, but it’s a desolate wasteland of help-me posts with 0 comments. That’s what happens without a give-to-get model.)

I’m not trying to start beef. That sub’s been around as long as we have, six months longer, actually, but their mod isn’t as active. Meanwhile, I’m here, logged in, fully caffeinated, and dangerously enthusiastic about helping creators. 

And this subreddit was never supposed to be about *just me* helping others. The goal was always creator-to-creator help to bring in that multi-niche concern that u/AfgAzi added at the end.

Now onto the second point:  ""I see lots of very, very bad thumbnails, and nobody is honest with them. Please be honest and tell them their thumbnail is trash and it will not attract clicks.""

Surely ""nobody"" is *a bit* of an exaggeration. Yes, we have all different types of humans here. Some folks are ""tell-it-like-it-is""-types, like crotchety old men waving their canes on their front lawns.  Others don't like to ""hurt people's feelings"". And, well, that's the human condition for ya. What can we do?

Still, I **actively encourage** evidence-based honesty. That’s why I created the ""[Ultimate Thumbnail Guide: Your Checklist to Improving CTR](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouTubeThumbnailHub/comments/w9proo/ultimate_thumbnail_guide_your_checklist_to/)"". In the “**Read This First**” post (pinned to the top of the subreddit), it’s mentioned as a way to help with feedback.  

**It's a dead-simple tool:** go through a list of proven tips and think. ""Pass, Fail, or N/A,"" on each point against a thumbnail being critiqued. Anybody, newbie or pro, can use it to give structured, specific, honest feedback that’s actually helpful.

As for the rudeness of the opinion concerns? Don't worry.  I didn’t think your post was rude. It was thoughtful, respectful, and clearly came from a desire to improve things. And hey, I appreciated the shoutout that my advice isn’t trash 😄

I try to respond to as many requests as I can, though I probably only get to half these days. Back in the early days, it was literally just me and the helpful members that frequented (and still do!) the community.

And since I’ve got your attention: A PROUD MOD MOMENT: 🎉 r/YouTubeThumbnailHub just passed **2,000 members**! From 0 to 600 in three years, then BOOM, reaching 2,200+ in just the last few months. That’s more creators helped, more knowledge shared, and more checklists used to improve thumbnails.

So yeah, maybe *some* advice around here is bad. But the system encourages feedback, boosts post visibility, helps creators connect, and builds momentum. That’s a net positive in my book.

Now, whether you made it reading this far or jumped straight to TL;DR, here it is:

**TL;DR**

* Yes, some advice is bad. That’s what happens when you require participation.
* But requiring feedback = better engagement = more reach = better odds of good help.
* The alternative? Dead posts, no feedback, and zero subreddit growth.
* Those looking to improve their critiques (of others and their own), try using the checklist. 
* Also, we hit 2K members, and that’s kinda cool.

**Anyway, thanks for coming to my TED Talk.** I’ll be in the comments with coffee and probably too many opinions.

I get some people have zero issues and it's been great for them but what's happening to me is HORRIFIC. I wonder if this has changed my brain forever? But then I read that these affects on the Brian can last anywhere from a few days to 3 months to even a year in some cases also dependent on how much and how long you took the drug. I also read in some cases you can have a rare but possibly fatal neurological reaction to this drug. X.x
Yall had I know THAT I would not have EVER taken it. There's just too many risks and it can get bad pretty quickly especially the suicidal thoughts...
Just venting guys, anyone else dealt with this? I understand if you just had the most phenomenal experience with this drug and good for you but I want to hear from other survivors of the horror side of this drug because this almost cost me my life and my sanity.

Servis bi bio u početku besplatan i na bazi donacija, a kasnije, ako se pokaže korisnim, naplaćivao bi se simbolično.

Dve stvari me zanimaju, ako mozete da mi pomognete.

Prva su dva dokumenta: Privacy policy i Terms and conditions. Da li su mi potrebna na sajtu? Kako bi izgledala prema našim zakonima, ako su potrebna?

Coffee definitely “switches my brain on”, but I’m not sure it helps me move from thinking to acting (I don’t want to stay stuck in my head—I need to *get things done*).

1llprm6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1llprm6,Nomad Review,"Excellent product for journaling, notetaking, and organizing. It was kinda of steep on the pricing... but as long as we dont have to pay any type of subscriptions this is well worth the trade off. I had bought the device because the company allows us to repair it with a new battery and the DIY section they offer with different solutions should be the standard across the industry. Also waiting on the Linux ports

**TL:DR. yes would highly recommend the device to any E-writer that wants a device to replace paper for digital storage.**

Positives:

* Excellent Battery Life. I rarely find myself needing to charge. Had the device for 7 months so far and still get impressed my charge notification barely comes on. I do write and read with it for about 4-5 hours a day, most days of the week.
* Love the look in natural sunlight. Even in the shade the device is still readable and writeable.
* I enjoy the writing feel even though it is not pen and paper like. It is also not like the Apple pen and Ipad glass feel. Also not having to charge the writing tool is my favorite feature and my favorite win when moving to supernote from apple Ipad infrastructure.
* Lightweight device, Nomad size is not too small but also isnt too big for the mobile user. Nomad size fits great with a laptop on the classroom desk or the small coffee shop table.
* Default UI settings are fairly efficient and customizable.
* Software is wonderful on the device and the Cloud App on the Iphone or Windows works great. I primarily just sync and read my notes on my larger laptop screen or load the phone app when i dont want to risk carrying around the supernote. I do use the apps to send PDF and documents to my device.

Hope and Dreams:

* Linux adaptations. Big Linux user. Im waiting for the app on linux or the ability to move and copy files through linux OS.
* Dont know if its possible but can we get a night reader and writer mode. Back lit screen so i can read and write with the wife asleep next to me. I can attach my booklight but the device doesnt have a section to clip it. Kinda scared to scratch or ruin the surface with a clip too
* Would be better IMO to have a much larger backing on the device. I modded the folio for the supernote to have a plastic surface so i can wipe and clean it if i lay it in some sugary drink or spill a mess on the table. The taller lip gives me some space to grab the device before liquid or food gets on the device. in addition to casing mods it would be great to have some sort of lever to make the device sit at an angle. Could be magnetic as well. One position to store it on the device , the other position to make an angled stance.
* Nomad ""Tuff"" version. Waterproof. More damage and fall resistant. Anti Glare or take away whatever happens to the screen when its under a bright light. Pretty sure im talking about screen glare.
* More UI Customizations. Example. I dont draw or change the pen type. I found the pen i liked and never changed. So if i could i would remove the Pen buttons from the UI.
* I love my Nomad but sometimes i do want a supernote the size of legal size paper so i can CAD draw my ideas to transfer later. or imagine using it on the court when coaching basketball games. Instead of erasing the play on the white board can just make new page.
* Can i make an email for my supernote device so i can send attachments to the supernote email and it will sync to my device. The same way emailing a printer, prints the document. same idea?

Cons:

Gestures.... I just turned them off. Maybe my fat hands are the problem but it would change the page when my hand was laying on it when writing. Could never QA the problem, never found the same position to repeat the problem, seemed quite random.

I would switch the UI buttons for real buttons. Maybe no real buttons either but a separate sections on the device for the buttons.

The buttons on the UI i use the most are:

1. Undo
2. Lasso
3. Eraser
4. Page Forward, Backwards, Pages
5. Insert Link

This meeting observes that it is becoming increasingly common for graduates of top-performing universities - those trained in the clinical quirks, chaos, and coffee queues of their local hospitals - to be shipped off to regions they neither know nor understand. Meanwhile, local deaneries are flooded with unfamiliar names, just because someone from a different uni ranked the place higher on a random number generator.

Therefore, this meeting calls upon the UK Foundation Programme Office, the statutory education bodies of all four nations, and the Department of Health & Social Care to:

1. Institute local preferential allocation for Foundation Programme training posts, whereby students trained in a region are actually allowed to stay there;

2. Formally link medical schools with their surrounding hospitals, so that trainees who have already figured out where the crash trolley lives aren’t replaced by someone trying to locate the mess room on day one;

3. Create a system where 'local talent' doesn’t have to become 'reluctant export', all because someone else ranked the region higher despite never having set foot in it.

After all, if the NHS is serious about retention, regional loyalty, and the warm fuzzy feeling of knowing where the staff car park is, it’s time to reward those who trained local by letting them stay local.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

* A focused Today view with all your tasks, habits, and events — no bouncing between apps

* Visualize your streaks and track progress over time
* Share habit progress screenshots to stay motivated or compete with friends

# 📅 Events + Countdowns

* Add events with built-in countdowns
* Choose when upcoming events appear in your Today view
* Calendar sync with your device — import events from your existing calendars automatically

1llpntk,https://i.redd.it/xjsx4mtgwf9f1.png,Khadlaj gourmand bomb,"I had high expectations for this gourmand monster — and I’m glad to say, it didn’t disappoint.

📦 Presentation:
The packaging is quite underwhelming — just a thin cardboard box, nothing special, average designer presentation esque. But the bottle itself feels premium. It’s heavy (almost or heavier than 9pm), solid, and definitely gives off the impression of a bold, luxurious fragrance.

👃 The Scent:
The moment I opened the box, the scent hit me instantly. This is a true gourmand bomb — strong, sweet, and comforting without being headache-inducing (not as sweet as Lattafa Eclair). What stood out to me was the powdery vanilla mixed with the richness of freshly ground coffee. It feels like being in a cozy café, sipping a warm cup of latte.

🧋 The interesting bits:
Here’s the interesting part — while many describe it as a coffee-heavy scent, to my nose, it leans kinda has a bubble tea smells (brown sugar to be exact). That creamy, slightly sweet profile really brings boba vibes rather than just stod alone espresso and vanilla.

🕰️ Longevity & Performance:
This stuff lasts. 3 to 4 sprays easily carry you through the entire day(don't overspray if you don't want to make people around you disappear instantly), it is an extrait so becareful with the sprayer cause it is oily (oily like Kaaf by Ahmed Al Maghribi). Strong projection too — you’ll get noticed, and in the best way possible.


✅ Final Verdict:
I genuinely enjoy this scent. This sweet bomb surely suits the date night or special occasions. And as a guy, I’d say it’s the kind of fragrance that pulls people in.This thing will surely make yo girl sniff you 24/7(even lick you if you wear it on specific time😉). It’s bold, cozy, and addictive.

2. **Mood Booster Extraordinaire**: Like, I went from wanting to cry over spilled milk to actually enjoying my morning coffee again. Who knew balancing hormones could make me feel more like me? 

3. **Brain Power**: Remembering why I walked into a room? ✅ Not only did I rediscover my ability to focus, but I also got back that sparkle of creativity (hello, painting and late-night DIYs!). 

4. **A Community Feeling**: While I was on this journey, the support I found in the community was amazing. It felt like I had friends cheering me on who *totally understood.* 

Most importantly, this wild ride reminded me of a crucial lesson: **we believe in meaningful results.** And let me tell you, it’s true!

Hey folks,

We hacked together a bot to fix one of life’s minor (but daily) headaches: figuring out when to leave home so you’re *not* late - or stuck staring at brake lights for an hour.

It’s built with **n8n**, **TomTom’s real-time traffic API**, and a sprinkle of **GPT‑4**. Here’s how it works:

 **What it does:**

1.	On Telegram, the bot asks you:

	•	Where you start (home)

	•	Where you’re headed (destination)

	•	What time you need to get there

	•	And whether you’re on two wheels or four

2.	Under the hood:

	•	**n8n** handles the automation flow

	•	**TomTom API** pulls both live and historical traffic data

	•	**GPT‑4** cleans and validates your responses

	•	We calculate when you should leave to make it *on time* (and not just “Google Maps says 32 min”)

3.	Each morning, you get a message like:

*“Traffic’s picking up. Leave by 7:52 AM to reach by 9:00 AM.”*

No fluff, just useful context before you’ve had your coffee.

**Got any APIs or ideas to make this sharper?**

I was prescribed for severe generalized anxiety (panic attacks every day) and depression. I'm currently on 1mg Fluanxol and 225mg Effexor daily taken in morning. I feel like its helped me in long run but I'm feeling the effects are subsiding or not giving kick enough. The doses for effexor is quite steep already. I'm dealing with dreading energy levels past 12PM and going to bed at 8-9PM while sleeping 10 hours at least daily. I still can see the visual triggers like aura from migraines but the meds keep me in tact and I don't feel much anxiety but quite a discomfort only. I can drink few energy drinks, or couple coffees and they will have 0 effect on energy, where in the past they would give crazy anxiety.

So question would be anyone been on this combination or what you think I should do and discuss with my doctor next month. He doesn't have much experience, just out of med school, hence I guess the weird combination.

In the past I tried quite a few meds including escitalopram 20mg which made me feel like zombie and no improvement, wellbutrin which increased my anxiety even more, buspar which made 0 change.",1,1751013836.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

Alright folks, welcome to Truth or Trash

This thread is for your  realest Chennai takes. Not the polished ones. Not the “don’t offend anyone” ones. The “actual” ones. The stuff you say to your closest friends when the filter coffee kicks in.

How it works:

* Scroll the comments.

* If someone drops a take, reply with your honest reaction. No format, no rules. Just say what you feel.

  * Agree? Say it.
  * Disagree? Roast it.
  * Confused? Ask questions.
  * Offended? You’re probably not alone.

* Got your own hot take about Chennai — traffic, food, places, people, culture, anything? Drop it in the comments. Let others call it **truth or trash**.

This isn’t a debate. It’s not a poll. It’s just people being real about the city we love (and sometimes hate).

Let’s go. Truth or trash? You decide.

I am from India, and sadly, my country loves tea more than coffee.  I purchased my Gaggia Classic in 2013 or 2014, and the machine has significantly improved my life.  

At times I broke something, at times the machine broke down - usually I got my parts from European websites, as I don't have parts available locally. The shipping usually takes 14-20 days, thus I usually keep some spare parts, a fuse, a valve, some rubber gaskets, etc. So that in case it breaks down, I can repair/maintain it on my own.  

I am running low on parts, and I was going to order some as spares.  However, I was also looking at the Brass Boiler version of the Gaggia Class. I wanted to ask are the main parts of the machine same? (of course, apart from the boiler) 

If the parts are different, then I would rather hold back till I purchase the E24 Evo (brass)... Any guidance would help.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The words echoed in my mind, a relentless epizeuxis that fueled the protagonist's journey against insurmountable odds. In the dystopian world I crafted, where hope was a rare commodity, the power of repetition became a beacon of resilience.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

**Response to Prompt 3: Hyperbole**

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

**Response to Prompt 6: Assonance**

Amidst the rolling hills of Harmony Valley, where the soft hum of nature's symphony echoed through the meadows, a mysterious traveler arrived, bringing with them a melody that resonated with the delicate assonance of a forgotten tune. The townsfolk, captivated by the harmonious vibrations, felt an inexplicable connection to the stranger.

As I explored the narrative, the assonance became a musical thread weaving through the story, emphasizing the emotional cadence of the characters' experiences. The traveler's words, laced with vowel-rich verses, carried the echoes of a distant melody, leaving an indelible impression on the hearts of those who listened.

Through the lens of assonance, I delved into the subtle interplay of sounds that defined the atmosphere of Harmony Valley. The lyrical quality of the narrative mirrored the town's collective journey, where the resonance of shared moments and emotions harmonized with the traveler's enigmatic presence.

**Response to Prompt 7: Onomatopoeia**

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own. The characters communicated through the vibrant echoes of everyday sounds, fostering a unique connection between the performer and the people of Metropolis. The narrative danced to the beat of onomatopoeic creativity, transforming the mundane into a dynamic celebration of city life.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed—a pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

**Response to Prompt 22: Metonymy**

In the political arena of Capital City, where decisions echoed through the corridors of power, a single phrase dominated conversations—the ""Iron Throne Statement."" This metonymic expression encapsulated not just a policy decision but the entire narrative of political maneuvering that unfolded within the city's hallowed halls.

The story unfolded with the metonymy acting as a symbolic gateway into the complexities of governance. The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals. Its impact rippled through the lives of citizens, shaping their destinies in ways they could scarcely fathom.

Through the lens of metonymy, I delved into the layers of meaning hidden within this political shorthand. The characters grappled not only with the literal implications of the Iron Throne Statement but also with the overarching themes of power, ambition, and the sacrifices demanded by political gamesmanship.

**Response to Prompt 24: Understatement**

In the picturesque town of Serenity Springs, where the days flowed like a lazy river and the nights were adorned with a blanket of stars, an unexpected event transpired—a subtle disruption that the locals described as ""just a minor hiccup."" Little did they know that this understatement concealed the unraveling of a cosmic anomaly.

The narrative unfolded with the charm of understatement, as the townsfolk continued their routines, blissfully unaware of the cosmic storm brewing beneath the surface. The serene descriptions of everyday life served as a stark contrast to the impending upheaval that threatened to reshape the very fabric of Serenity Springs.

Through the lens of understatement, I explored the characters' nonchalant reactions to the unfolding events. The once quiet river became a conduit for interdimensional travel, and the night sky, adorned with stars, transformed into a celestial canvas of possibilities. The charm of Serenity Springs became a poignant backdrop to the understated drama that unfolded, emphasizing the profound impact hidden within the simplicity of daily life.

**Response to Prompt 25: Cliché**

In the small town of Nostalgia Haven, where memories lingered like whispers in the wind, a peculiar phenomenon occurred—the resurgence of clichés. As the narrative unfolded, the once-endearing phrases like ""time heals all wounds"" and ""love conquers all"" took on a literal dimension, shaping the lives of the townsfolk in unexpected ways.

The story immersed itself in the world of clichés, where the seemingly predictable phrases became living entities with the power to alter reality. As characters grappled with the clichés that defined their lives, they discovered that beneath the familiarity lay profound truths and unexpected consequences.

Through the lens of cliché, I explored the characters' journey to navigate the clichéd landscapes of their existence. The town, once steeped in predictable routines, became a stage for the extraordinary. As clichés transformed into tangible forces, the residents of Nostalgia Haven embarked on a quest to unravel the mysteries hidden within the clichéd fabric of their reality.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded introspection. As I embarked on the freewriting journey, the repetition of this existential inquiry became a rhythmic pulse, guiding the exploration of diverse

perspectives on life's purpose.

For a multitude of words, the epanalepsis led me through a kaleidoscope of reflections. From the philosophical musings of scholars to the simple yet profound revelations of everyday individuals, each recurrence of the question served as a gateway into the vast tapestry of human contemplation.

Through the epanalepsis, I navigated the labyrinth of existential ponderings, unveiling the unique responses that individuals had forged in their quests for meaning. The relentless repetition became a literary heartbeat, mirroring the universal rhythm of humanity's collective pursuit of purpose and significance.

The narrative wove through the lives of characters, each grappling with the epanaleptic inquiry in their unique ways. Whether seeking solace in the grandeur of the cosmos or finding meaning in the simplicity of a shared moment, the epanalepsis remained a constant companion, echoing the perennial quest for understanding.

**Response to Prompt 36: Anadiplosis**

In the futuristic city of Quantum Heights, where technology intertwined with daily life like a seamless dance, a viral message spread—a mantra that echoed through the cybernetic veins of the metropolis. ""Create the code, the code creates reality. Reality shapes destiny, and destiny is but the code.""

The story unfolded with the rhythmic cadence of anadiplosis, each line flowing into the next, creating a recursive loop of ideas. The mantra became the heartbeat of Quantum Heights, influencing the lives of its denizens as they navigated the intricate balance between the virtual and the tangible.

Through the lens of anadiplosis, I delved into the interconnectedness of code, reality, and destiny. The lines blurred as characters harnessed the power of programming to shape their fates. Quantum Heights, once a mere city, transformed into a living algorithm, where the repetition of the mantra echoed in every pulsating byte.

**Response to Prompt 38: Asyndeton**

In the dystopian city of Emberfall, where the remnants of a fallen civilization lay entwined with the shadows of despair, a lone figure emerged—a rebel determined to dismantle the oppressive regime. The narrative unfolded with the rapid pace of asyndeton, omitting conjunctions to mirror the urgency of the protagonist's quest.

Through a cascade of words, the asyndeton propelled the reader through the city's decaying alleyways and towering citadels, each sentence building upon the last. The disjointed rhythm captured the relentless momentum of the rebel's journey, emphasizing the magnitude of the challenges faced in their struggle for freedom.

As the narrative unfurled, the absence of conjunctions served as a narrative device, intensifying the sense of urgency and desperation that permeated Emberfall. The rebel's asyndetic odyssey unfolded against a backdrop of shattered hopes and whispered rebellions, culminating in a crescendo of defiance against the oppressive regime.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The mantra echoed in the desolate wasteland of Endless Sands, a barren landscape where hope was as scarce as water. Through the repetition of epizeuxis, the protagonist's internal resolve became a resounding anthem, a defiant roar against the relentless challenges of survival.

For a multitude of words, the relentless repetition of ""never"" served as a lifeline, propelling the protagonist through the harshest of environments. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry against the oppressive silence of Endless Sands, a declaration that reverberated across the vast expanse.

Through the lens of epizeuxis, I delved into the depths of the character's determination. The harsh environment became a character in itself, challenging the protagonist to defy the odds with unwavering persistence. The echoes of ""never"" transformed into a symbol of resilience, a beacon of hope that cut through the desolation of Endless Sands.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

Amidst the starlit expanse of Cosmos Haven, where galaxies danced in celestial choreography, a cryptic prophecy emerged—a message written in the stars. As the narrative unfolded, I embarked on a cosmic journey guided by the acrostic hidden within the constellations.

For a cascade of words, the initial letters of key phrases illuminated the path of destiny for the characters. Each sentence unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden message that transcended the boundaries of time and space. The acrostic became a celestial guide, leading the protagonists through the intricate tapestry of their interconnected fates.

Through the lens of acrostic, I explored the cosmic forces that shaped the destinies of Cosmos Haven's inhabitants. The celestial bodies became storytellers, each constellation contributing a verse to the epic narrative written across the cosmos. As the characters deciphered the acrostic, they unraveled the mysteries of their existence, connecting the dots between the stars and their own profound journeys.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

Everything is great, and for an early-release product Dia is indeed so refined.   
One of the quirky features I LOVE so far is adding a tailing ""?""  to a new tab prompt affects on if it's gonna be a chat query or a your-default-search-engine query. I heavily use it and now that I've gotten used to it, I cannot go back to Arc ( been a long-time user of Arc). It's something novel and more emphasised, kind of a signature ""The Browser Company"" style feature: quirky, cheekily smart and undeniably elegant. Stuff like this would make an end developer-genre user like me stick and gain affinity for choosing Dia over other AI browsers definitively.   


The bad

The bad is I hate that Cmd + Z doesn't work, like that would literally make life so much easier. And I'm a heavy keyboard user, so I just spam Cmd + W often to clear like 20 consecutive tabs that are just docs of some libs on and on, and I'm done with what I wanted now. Happens often I just abuse Cmd + W and purge tabs I need accidentally, and I immediately hate that I have to now question myself if the tab was worth the trouble of doing a quick 5-click routine to open it back up from history, or just let it be. And it happens a lot more than you can imagine. I largely believe that's a silver lining because navigation and browsing, discovering, scanning information is definitely much faster now with Dia. I've always been a never-have-too-many-tabs-open guy but I find myself doing that with Dia quite often, because Dia allows me to just navigate through information, hierarchical stuff like docs as well, like a vague mind map. Hence I open a lot of tabs, switch tabs around with keyboard, scan everything, keep spamming open new tabs and deleting ones I'm on or have scanned. This goes on till I find what I want and then just purge all tabs related to this chain of thought. It's a small left-out feature, and there are much better novel ones added in that I like. Just feels anti-pattern and hate that something tiny affects my work quite a lot.

The ugly  
There are a lot of CUA-agents based task/browser/automation products and ventures rapidly iterating in the past few months, and end of the day it's AI that's the backbone for everything.   
Among few major differentiators that remain for AI products competing in the same market-fit space, is just great design that empowers efficiency. All AI products have AI inherently and we should get used to it not being a ""wow"" factor anymore, in fact I believe that has already started to wane among non-tech tech-savy individuals (like say your younger brother in school, who uses a ton of different assistants already, albeit doesn't necessarily code at a high level) to the people in the tech-space.   
  
However everyone competes to develop more efficient implementations of AI for their use-cases, makes me picture a very heavily iterating future in the tech space, however as efficiency, cost/speed/time demand of iterating on products keeps getting exponentially lower, people also believe in 50 years perhaps we can all just make whatever we want on-demand by speaking to an all-governing AI, which just raw-dogs and builds you Stripe in 5 secs of beastly compute time, because you don't want to ""install"" a third-party software on your ecosystem to dish out cash at your local McDonald's? Get into newsletters, trackers, all that stuff? Why,  it's just ""ew"" at that point. Why ""install"" anything, unless you're dependant on the third party would be the case. I ask, where is the limit? A Goverment-regulated AGI would have access to public banking APIs, with right security routines in place. You might as well ask it to make your Google-Pay Clone star-wars theme while you're at it, cos why not!? We do love custom wallets.

AI keeps getting more hardcore at doing stuff and I just believe its creating in a huge communication gap between the work we produce and the thought we put into it. AI in few years iterates beastly on everything and well who says it's just one. Perhaps you can build a fleet of few AI agents for yourself and then they're 10 AIs communicating, processing, iterating information where each one is already doing it 10x faster than an avg human. So the ratio drops to 1:100 real quick, and this is like in less than 5 years.   
Scaling goes infinite theoretically, but I believe what DEFINES a ""better"" AI product when two are compared in the same use-case, is ""How much faster, can you convey to-and-fro, users chain-of-thought and intents, real-time, than X, and act upon it to user's satisfaction."". Perhaps it's better design, perhaps it's keyboard shortcuts (also design but can't think of better examples). When I leave my copilot running iterating on some tasks I give it, and go make coffee, I'm largely worried that it'll go astray and do something that I have to spend time undoing. There's that loss in communication. And why can't I rely on my intent to reflect as is on what the AI produces there? I feel a constant need for supervision, because I know it will go astray 1 out of 10 times, I've seen it happen. I feel there needs to be better ways and AI products are getting norm, everyone just strapping in a chat which does stuff user can do directly, but now they can avoid. Well literally everything has that now, and increasingly expensive design language as X in series-X funding goes up. I'm just frustrated because many AI startups build for a use-case, but do not consider to put more effort into tailoring it to the use-case. I believe there's two major differentiators - offerings and novelty with communication/implementation speed. A customer might go to another competitor because they have more features, more third-party tools support, etc. But if you don't work on that, it still doesn't mean the life is easy for competitor because someone else will definitely given enough time. We get it AI is here it's awesome. What would truly be stellar is if my intents can be mapped to the actionables better, and if communication was made seamless for revisions. I cannot type in a chat 10 times to correct. AI products in my opinion are yet to discover the sweet-balance between intent, actionables, and being in sync with user's chain of thought. I do understand that we can't have neuralinks yet, and people just feel what else can be improved in a chat. Or to make it faster, voice-chat. On a non-tech consumer level feels like I take 1 step to guide 10 steps for AI to get something done, which is cool, because I know I'll be the same guy frustrated if I have to tell it 10 times the next step. As a dev, when I abuse LLMs and do multi agent setup, this disparity goes higher. The only reason I've always loved Browser Co is because it's about doing what user needs to do, but tailored and better. I've myself been inspired from many Arc features in personal projects, and it has been one of my references when I think of design language while ideating a product. I hope Dia is not rushed. I hope the design language doesn't change. It speaks of a priority towards working on tailoring to users intents and I feel that is the best one for this AI wave, and browser Co is already aligned towards this, have great experience in this as well. I hope future AI products work better on reducing the communication gap, and not shy away from snappy robust revision-heavy interfaces. If more revisions mean better faster outputs for our intents, we'd all love that. What we hate is the repetative-effort that comes along. Revisions should be seamless and I am very confident any AI product where revisions are a breeze and something a user can perform at a high frequency (>15 a min atleast to begin with, since there are none yet lol). If that can be achieved without requiring being a pain for the users, it would be a truly novel AI product.",1,1751012014.0,diabrowser,0,1.0,False
