1mzoy07,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeneathTheMasks/comments/1mzoy07/my_passion_cacao/,My passion: Cacao,"I'm quite new here and thought to share how I experience cacao once a week.  Because for me, it‚Äôs more than a drink: it‚Äôs a way to slow down, connect with nature, and reflect.



On my ritual day, I eat nothing and only drink water before preparing the cacao. I grind cacao nibs (or beans) by hand and the process itself is meditative. I usually let the nibs sunbathe before grinding as it tends to make it easier. During the colder months I have to put them on a heater or into the sauna when it's cooling down but is still warm enough. I do it outside in the sun when I can, or near a window where I can watch the world outside. This preparation helps me set an intention, focus, and really connect with the plant. I can only work with a mortar at the moment (waiting for my metate to arrive) so it usually takes around 4-5hours. I know I sound crazy but I guess that's what a deep passion does to a lot of people. 



I usually prepare around 40‚Äì45g of cacao for two people, and sometimes add a touch of chili, but nothing else. Then I pour the cacao into a pot with water around 70‚Äì80¬∞C, and pour it back and forth between pot and cup to make it creamy. I do not call it hot chocolate as I see hot chocolate as another thing entirely. The gap between cacao like this and hot chocolate is as far as Ethiopian coffee is to a vanilla latte. I also don‚Äôt use a blender or other shortcuts like some ‚Äúceremony‚Äù videos I‚Äôve seen.   
Modern shortcuts would take this ritualistic aspect away for me and how I want to experience it.   
Before drinking, I pour a small sip onto the earth as a gesture of respect towards the culture it actually comes from. 



Drinking cacao this way feels grounding, warm, and opens me to reflection. I feel calmer, more connected, and it often helps me process my emotions. Which is a blessing when you're autistic and usually struggle with these things. 

  
Well, that's it for now I guess. I might go into it deeper at some point but I'm just here testing the waters.   
Talking about cacao like this usually ends up with dismissive comments. I know this might seem unusual to some, but I hope I can spark some curiosity and reflection.

They moved into my place with some other friends because we had a spare room and they wanted to move out of their parent‚Äôs place. Since moving in they have been a pretty bad roommate, their room is really gross (not just messy but it smells very putrid) and I have talked to them about this but it hasn‚Äôt got much better. They also don‚Äôt do their dishes, or they will leave their washing in the machine for days or on the line for weeks (we only have one washing line). This has caused tension in a previously very harmonious house. 

I also found out shortly after living with them about substance abuse issues. They drink very frequently (almost daily) and they smoke weed every day, and do other drugs, and they vape. I don‚Äôt really care about the vaping but it is part of the reason that they never have money. That being said, they never have money and they have been asking me for a lot of favours because of that. They continuously ask me for rides (almost every day) because they have no car (and have no intention of getting a car) and they never offer to pay for gas. They also will go out and then ask me or my roommates for a ride home because they went out with no money and stranded themselves (they will do this even if it‚Äôs rush hour traffic and can‚Äôt get anywhere) They also have asked me to pay for many things and continue to do so more and more. They have asked me to pay for, or give them money for; weed, alcohol, other drugs, groceries, food/coffee while eating out, vape stuff etc. it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I feel very used and I feel like they don‚Äôt really talk to me unless it‚Äôs to ask for stuff. When they first moved in I would say yes more, but I now say no to most things. 

I have tried to talk to them about their substance abuse and they always respond along the lines of ‚ÄúI know I need to cut back but I can‚Äôt for X reason‚Äù such as needing weed to sleep, or that weed isn‚Äôt that bad for you, or they generally don‚Äôt treat it like a big deal.

I have a lot of empathy for them because I know they struggle with mental health issues but I also need to address this stuff and I don‚Äôt really know how. I don‚Äôt want to be rude and I find confrontation difficult, and I know that substance abuse is complicated and I don‚Äôt want to make matters worse. It also feels like a bad idea to confront them with a laundry list of problems, but also everyday things seem to get worse.

1mzov3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mzov3t/aio_i_might_of_slept_with_a_russian_supremacist/,AIO I might of slept with a Russian supremacist (I‚Äôm Ukrainian),"CW: sex, kinks? Idk anymore üò≠

I (17f) might of slept with a possible Russian supremacist (18m) but I don‚Äôt know if I should go as fair as to call him that.

I am mixed (Indian and Ukrainian) and working class so I speak out about a lot of things like the Ukraine war, the rising hate towards immigrants in the uk, racism towards brown people, classism, and the fetishisation of races and ethnicities (from my experience being both Indian and Ukrainian). Because of that I always try and see where someone stands on these topics before becoming friends or partners with them.

A while ago I met a guy (18m) who was also mixed (English and Russian) and upper middle class. From what I could tell he had the same views as me on my focused issues so I thought he was ok.

We met up a couple days ago and went out, it was nice, he paid for my coffee and food we walked around, went to a gallery. He was easy to talk to, we made some jokes about how both his ethnicities oppressed my ethnicities, we talked about music and shows we liked. But he started saying some things that were a bit questionable to me: he casually mentioned that he was a sociopath, when I said I was applying for a job at Sainsbury‚Äôs and did work experience at a small art club helping children he said that he never realised how much he relied on nepotism until I said that (btw this guy has an apprenticeship in a very high up department in the uk government through family connections), he kept asking me about philosophical subjects and got a bit annoyed when I couldn‚Äôt give a proper answer as I said I don‚Äôt know too much about philosophy, and said that Ukraine getting back the 30% taken by Russia is unrealistic (Ik it probably won‚Äôt ever happen but you don‚Äôt say that to someone who just said their family were getting bombed) and asked what I realistically wanted to get out of that war which should of been my first red flags.

Things calmed down a bit and I stupidly agreed to sleep with him (I know i was stupid, I know it was a bad idea and I deeply regret it). It was going normally until he started saying shit that was a bit too xenophobic to ignore.

Here are some direct quotes of what he was saying because there was so much shit and I‚Äôm still processing everything:

- ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my little Ukrainian slut‚Äù

- ‚Äúyou like begging for Russian dick‚Äù

- ‚ÄúI bet if your Ukrainian family could see you they‚Äôd be so ashamed‚Äù

- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm superior to you‚Äù

- ‚ÄúUkrainian men would be lucky to have someone as pretty as you‚Äù

- ‚ÄúUkrainian men don‚Äôt deserve you‚Äù

- ‚ÄúRussia will always win against you, your people should just give up‚Äù

- ‚ÄúUkrainian women as pretty as you are reserved for men like me‚Äù

- ‚ÄúI bet you only went out with me because I had money, dirty Ukrainian bitch‚Äù

I was mortified, I was appalled, I was in shock. Because I was in shock and in disbelief I froze up and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to say something. When he was done I just got my things and said I was going to go, he walked me to the train station and said he didn‚Äôt mean anything by what he was saying but not to tell anyone as it could ruin his future political career.

Now I don‚Äôt want to kink shame, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm crazy for thinking that was racist and xenophobic as fuck. Like you have to have some form of hate within you to bring yourself to say stuff like that unprompted, let alone get off from it. I know he said he didn‚Äôt mean what he was saying but it felt very well organised, to the point where I don‚Äôt think this came out of nowhere for him. So yeahhhhhh

I don‚Äôt want to call this guy a Russian supremacist if he‚Äôs not but it‚Äôs kind of not looking good for him.",1,1756124166.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.67,False

We first grew close after high school ‚Äî spending almost every day together, going for walks, shopping, and hanging out. Even when she moved away for college and later to Florida, we kept in close touch and made time to see each other when we could. When she moved back closer (about 3 hours away), our friendship felt stronger than ever, and I even asked her to be my maid of honor when I got engaged.

That engagement ended badly, and I went through a really rough breakup/legal mess. At first she was supportive ‚Äî answering my calls, being there for me, checking in ‚Äî but a few months in she said she needed to step back for her own reasons. That hurt a lot, but I understood and respected it. However, what was especially painful was that on the day I was supposed to get married, she didn‚Äôt reach out to me at all. Just days before, she had been venting to me about her work stress, and I was giving her emotional support.

From there, our contact became inconsistent. Over time, I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm usually the one putting in effort ‚Äî traveling to see her, calling, planning trips. She visits our hometown often (her family lives here) but rarely tells me, doesn‚Äôt try to plan a coffee date or something small, or will invite me just to tag along with her family. We‚Äôve tried planning girls‚Äô trips that always fall through on her end. She‚Äôs even forgotten my birthday before.

We have talked openly about our friendship and how we‚Äôve both been feeling, and I do think she‚Äôs made some effort lately ‚Äî like occasionally being the first to text. But in reality, I haven‚Äôt seen her since her engagement back in December.

Last fall, her boyfriend asked me to help plan a surprise proposal and engagement party. I said yes and was glad to be part of it. But at the party, she mostly socialized with her local friends. I realize it was a whirlwind of a day for them, but I barely spoke to her until later that night. It was tough because I‚Äôd traveled to be there, and it was only the second time we‚Äôd seen each other that year.

Now, she‚Äôs about to ask me to be her co‚Äìmaid of honor alongside her college best friend. Part of me still loves her deeply and sees this as a chance to reconnect. But another part of me feels the friendship is unbalanced and one-sided, and I‚Äôm afraid saying yes will set me up for the same pattern of giving more than I get.

So here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm stuck: I don‚Äôt know if being her maid of honor would help us reconnect, or if it would just put me back into the same one-sided dynamic. I‚Äôd really appreciate advice on how to navigate this.

TL;DR: Best friends for 10 years, but our friendship has become one-sided and distant. She didn‚Äôt reach out on the day I was supposed to get married, and I haven‚Äôt seen her since her engagement in December. Now she‚Äôs about to ask me to be her co‚Äìmaid of honor.

Colorful leaves in the most beautiful autumn colors sailed down the classroom window at Baywatch-like speed. Jake had rested his head in the palm of his hand, staring dreamily at the leaf-covered schoolyard of Ravenwood High. ""Just a few more months, and we'd finally be out of this damn boring little town,"" he thought. Jake and his friends lived in a sleepy little town called Ravenwood, Pennsylvania. The only thing their town had ever been mentioned in the national news for was a mine fire at a coal mine in 1961. In this tragic accident, 66 men were killed, and only a few survived. No one knew exactly how many, as there were no records or work rosters there from that time. It was a dark day for Ravenwood, and the older generation didn't like to talk about it, even though Jake sometimes thought they knew more about the accident than they cared to admit. The mine was closed after the accident, and the cause of the fire in Shaft 9 was never determined. There wasn't much to do in this city for high school seniors, so many of them moved to New York or Boston to attend college and finally enjoy life, as Elijah always said. Elijah, the muscle-bound football star, was Jake's oldest and best friend and had a promising football career as a quarterback ahead of him. His dream was to be the first African-American quarterback from Pennsylvania to make it into the Football Hall of Fame. As captain and ball distributor of the Ravenwood Ravens, he was one of the most popular and sought-after boys in school. Even though everyone knew that Elijah Johnson, star quarterback, had been dating cheerleading queen Stella Reed since fifth grade, girls repeatedly tried to catch Elijah's eye.

""Ouch,"" Jake stammered, annoyed, rudely torn from his daydream.

Elijah had thrown a paper ball at his temple from across the classroom.

""That bum, he could limit his throwing skills to the football field,"" he thought to himself.

Elijah grinned maliciously and gestured for Jake to open the paper ball.

""Hey Parker, let's go to the Halloween fair with Luke and the girls today,"" was written in scrawled handwriting on the crumpled paper.

Jake hated Halloween. Ever since he was six years old and scared to death by his older cousin in a Michael Myers costume on Halloween, he has had a strict phobia of all kinds of scary things, horror, and costumes. Ravenwood already had a few strange quirks compared to other towns. For example, there was an annual Founder's Festival where everyone dressed in yellow, and the Pawpaw Festival, where overripe bananas were used as projectiles, and the townspeople would throw them at each other for fun all day. Another unusual event was the recurring fair, which always took place at the same time during Halloween week. Since things are usually pretty boring in Ravenwood, the Halloween fair was a big event for young and old. Jake hated the fair too; it always seemed creepy to him, and there were rumors that people would disappear on Halloween night and were never found again. He looked annoyed at the still grinning Elijah and waved a dismissive hand. When the school bell rang for recess, Jake and Elijah went to their regular table in the cafeteria where the others from their group were already waiting.¬†

There was Kate Hudson, the brown-haired beauty with bright green eyes who was Jake's girlfriend; Luke Littler, the somewhat stocky blonde guitarist in the school band; his girlfriend Zoey Crawford; and Elijah and Stella. They had been a close-knit group since the beginning of high school, and as luck would have it, some couples had formed. Jake kept asking himself how he ever deserved such a charming girl like Kate, and he wanted nothing more than to start a new chapter of his life with her in New York. New York, the city that never sleeps‚Äîquite a contrast to a small town that's always asleep, Jake chuckled thoughtfully. As they sat down at the table with the others, Elijah started blustering: ""Hey guys, let's go to the fair today. I heard there are a lot of new attractions this year.""

""Good idea,"" the girls sang in unison. Luke also nodded in agreement.

""What about you, babe? I know you're not a Halloween fan,"" Kate said sympathetically to Jake.

""You said it!"" he replied.

""Come on‚Äîfor my sake?"", she whispered. Whenever Kate wanted something from him, she gave him her irresistible puppy-dog stare, which he was simply powerless to resist.¬†

""I'll think about it and let you know later,"" Jake said disarmed.

""If he says so, I've already won,"" Kate giggled at Stella.

They ate their lunch, which consisted, in true Halloween style, of ghost nuggets, ridged fries, and a pumpkin pie with spider web frosting, and went back to the classroom for their last two periods before the holidays began. The school was decorated with paper bats and stuffed ghosts that swayed in the draft of the hustle and bustle in the hallways. Rays of sunlight filtered through the high windows of Ravenwood High, bathing the school in a warm pre-holiday atmosphere. Two hours later, it was finally there. The sweet sound of the school bell sending the students off on their well-deserved fall break. The halls filled with happy faces, and Jake and Elijah fought their way out.

""Come on, you spoilsport, you're coming with us tonight‚Äîit's Halloween Man!"" Elijah yelled at Jake.

He picked up one of the small, slightly rotten pumpkins that were lying on the school's front steps as decoration and threw it at Jake.

""OH FUCK,"" Elijah whispered.

Normally, Elijah would never have missed, but Jake had cleverly ducked, and the pumpkin sailed just over his head. Just then, the old math teacher, Mr. Fletcher, stepped out of the door and hit him square in the middle of his white shirt. Squishy, ‚Äã‚Äãmusty-smelling pumpkin lumps dripped from his neatly ironed Italian shirt, and his face turned a frightening shade of red.

""This is going to be trouble,"" Jake stammered.

""RUN!"" Elijah yelled.

""PAARKER, JOHNSOOON, detention for a WEEK!"" raged Mr. Fletcher.

The boys jumped down five flights of stairs at once and ran down the street as fast as they could.

""I bet Mr. Fletcher that won't be until after the holidays!"" Elijah yelled cheekily over his shoulder.

The two of them gave each other their best-friend handshakes while running, barely able to contain their laughter. When they were three blocks out of danger, they stopped and doubled over with stomach aches.

""Oh man, did you see his face?"" Elijah snorted.

""That was a real hit, Eli,"" Jake giggled. ""Come on, I'm in today. I hate you for it, but I'm in.""

""Great!"" Elijah said smugly. ""I'll let the others know, meet us at Booker's Drugstore on the corner at 8:00.""

#                                  Chapter 2 ‚Äì The Fair

Jake rode his blue mountain bike down the busy street to the agreed-upon meeting point. The last rays of dawn were gradually giving way to a gloomy night. The moon was already high in the sky, and a cool breeze made Jake zip up his jacket a little higher. Dense webs of fake spiders stretched over the hedges, their black bodies glinting in the lantern lights. Rows of jack-o'-lanterns flickered in the front yards, some with friendly faces, others with grotesquely distorted ones, their shadows dancing across the wooden floorboards. Children in costumes ran excitedly from door to door, their bags jingling with candy. A little vampire stumbled, laughing, over his overlong cape, while a witch with a green face called out loudly, ""Trick or treat!"" Parents walked leisurely behind, holding coffee mugs and exchanging nostalgic glances. Jake felt uneasy about going to the Halloween fair and slightly regretted having agreed. At least he'd be spending the evening with Kate. When he turned the corner, the others were already waiting in front of Booker's Drugstore and jokingly greeted him with a warm pumpkin spice latte. Mister Booker was known throughout the city for his excellent hot drinks, and the scent of cinnamon, ginger, and cloves wafted pleasantly into Jake's nostrils.

""Hey guys,"" Jake greeted his friends.

""Hey, scaredy-cat, are you ready to shit your pants?"" Elijah provoked him with a grin.

Jake gave him a light smack on the back of the head and greeted Kate with a kiss. The atmosphere that evening was fabulous, and everyone in the group was in a great mood. The autumn sun had now completely disappeared, and in the distance, they could already see the entrance gate of the Ravenwood Halloween Fair. It lay like a glowing island in the autumnal darkness. As they entered the fairground, they marveled at this year's decorations. Colorful strings of lights glowed orange, purple, and blood red, stretching across the square. The colors reflected in the puddles of wet asphalt, making everything seem unreal‚Äîhalf joyful, half spooky. Crowds of people dressed as vampires, witches, skeletons, or movie monsters milled between the stalls. Cotton candy smelled sweeter than usual, with a hint of cinnamon and pumpkin, while somewhere the scent of roasted almonds hung in the air.¬†

The rattling of the roller coaster mingled with the squeaking of the Ferris wheel, whose gondolas hovered above the fairground like glowing pumpkins. They crossed the entire square, grabbing a few treats here and there and joking around incessantly. Suddenly, Kate snatched the bag of roasted almonds from Jake's hand and playfully ran away.

""Catch me if you can, cowboy,"" she shouted.

""Just you wait,"" Jake laughed and rushed after her.

She ran down the path and turned right toward the restrooms, which were located behind a shooting gallery. When Jake caught up with her, she was trapped between two caravans and a barrier fence like the ones you find on construction sites.

""Shit, I guess the evil killer got me,"" she whispered, mock-dramatically.

Jake grinned, pushed her lovingly against the barrier, and kissed her. This moment between them seemed like an endless dream, and Jake wished he would never wake up when the fence suddenly gave way and they both fell backward. When they realized what had just happened, they both laughed, and Jake helped Kate up.

""Are you hurt?"" he asked cautiously.

""No, silly, you've been lighter before, but I was fine,"" she replied, giggling.

""WOOOW, look."" Jake turned around and looked at what Kate was pointing at. A huge, rusty industrial ruin peeked out from behind two tall fir trees. Such buildings were not uncommon in Pennsylvania. Due to the deindustrialization of the industrial sector and the relocation of jobs to countries with lower production costs, the state was also known as the ""Rust Belt,"" and many abandoned remnants still exist, uncared for.

""Wasn't the fair near the closed coal mine?"" Jake wondered.

A cold gust of wind blew in, casting a mystical shadow over the clearing where the building stood. Although the loud sounds of the fair had been omnipresent just a moment ago, this place seemed to swallow every sound with its captivating dark presence. Jake got goosebumps and the hairs on his arms stood on end.

""Look, there's a neon sign burning,"" Kate said. ""Let's go closer.""

At that moment, Jake would have preferred to spend the week in detention with Mr. Fletcher than go any closer to this creepy ruin, but he couldn't look like a wimp in front of his girlfriend, so he followed her. He took his phone out of his pocket and tapped the flashlight icon so they could see a little more. The old industrial hall towered like a black skeleton against the gray sky. Rusty steel girders broke through the cloud cover, and the facade was riddled with cracks from which ivy crawled like dark veins. A sweet, metallic smell hung in the air‚Äîrust, oil, maybe something else that should have rotted away long ago. They spotted rusty rail sections in front of the building that led into the hall's interior.

""It's a haunted house,"" Kate exclaimed euphorically. The flashing neon sign dangled diagonally to the right above the entrance gate. The colorful letters flickered alternately with the words ""Real Fun.""

""I wonder if this is another attraction at the fair?""

""I don't think so, Kate. There's not a soul here, and it's a bit remote from the main fairgrounds,"" Jake said uncertainly.

Suddenly, they heard a metallic clatter from behind them and saw their friends climbing over the fallen construction fence and running toward them with their cell phone flashlights.

""There you are, lovebirds,"" Stella called over to them with a sneer on her lips.

""Crazy!"" stammered Luke.

""How did you find this?"" Zoey asked, astonished.

""It doesn't matter, folks, the fact is, we're going to see this creepy pile of metal from the inside!"" Elijah said, his eyes twinkling at the buzzing neon sign. ""Real Fun, what a stupid name for a ghost train. They're usually called something like 'Ghost Ride, Nightmare Alley,' or something like that. Real Fun is seriously not a scary name for... whoaahhh.""

Elijah was startled when a large, black, hooded figure suddenly appeared at the entrance to the gate. Where a face should have been, there was only a dark cavern that seemed to swallow the light. The outline seemed human, and yet something was wrong: the shoulders too narrow, the body too elongated, the movements too gliding, as if it weren't walking, but floating over the ground. Where the sleeves ended, long, bony fingers protruded, pale and sinewy, curling restlessly around small ride chips like spider legs.

""Step in... and leave the light outside. Only shadows wait inside,"" came the ominous cry from the hooded figure's dark cavern.

""Crazy,"" Luke whispered again.

""Okay, Mister Hooded Man, how much does this hell ride cost?"" Elijah chuckled.

""Eli, you can't be serious. Ten horses couldn't get me in there,"" Zoey said indignantly.

""Come on, babe, it'll be fun,"" Luke said persuasively.

""Absolutely not, and you'll be a gentleman and wait outside with me, Luke,"" Zoey whined firmly.

""Hmph,"" he gasped.

""Okay, Mister Hooded Man, then just four tickets please,"" said Elijah.

""Admission isn't paid in coins. Only those with the courage to lose themselves are allowed through these gates..."" croaked the hooded figure.

""Hahaha, look at him. Come on, guys, let's go in,"" Elijah snorted.

Jake wasn't at all comfortable with the whole thing, but somehow no one seemed to find the situation as strange and creepy as he did. Sure, Zoey was there, but she was already creeped out by a bedsheet with a face cut out.

""I don't know, bro, doesn't this whole thing seem a bit weird to you? This run-down haunted house outside the fair, and it's supposed to be free?"" said Jake.

""It's probably a sales trick, a way to lure people onto the ride, scare them first, and then collect their money. I saw something similar with my brother in Boston,"" Elijah replied.

Kate took Jake by the hand, grinned at him, and pulled him toward the hooded figure. As they approached, Jake caught the scent of cold stone and mustiness, as if this man had stepped directly from a dark crypt. They took the ride tokens from the black silhouette's bony hand and walked through the rusty gate toward the tracks, where several passenger cars were already waiting. Jake turned the cold metal ride token over in his hand and read the raised letters on it. On one side, the name of the ghost train, ""Real Fun,"" was written in runny, flaking red lettering, and on the other side, there was simply a picture of a dark gravestone.

""I hate Halloween,"" Jake thought again.

The seating cars were also made of rusty metal and had the design of a bony zombie hand unfolding, practically meant to be sat in. The dark red, cold leather seat smelled musty and of dirt. Jake helped Kate climb into the car and followed behind her. He'd never felt so uncomfortable about anything, but he just couldn't be a coward in front of the lady of his heart.

""There aren't even seatbelts here,"" Elijah smirked, nudging Jake on the shoulder from the car behind them.

""Have fun,"" Luke called from outside.

""Wooooo, here we go!"" Stella cheered.

Jake took Kate's hand as the ghost train squealed into motion, its wheels shuddering on the dusty tracks. The metal sounded like painful screams mingled with the stench of old oil and something sweet, reminiscent of decay. Slowly, the wagon crawled into the gaping entrance, its black opening like a maw. The rattle of the wheels blended with the screech of the chains, and Jake could have sworn he heard whispering voices among the sounds. Words that seemed not meant for the living.

#                                Chapter 3 ‚Äì ""Real Fun""

A cold gust of wind blew across Jake's face, bringing with it the stench of sweet decay and wet metal that caught in his throat. Kate, Stella, and Elijah giggled happily in their seats, their sounds bouncing off the steel walls like ghostly wails. For the first few meters, it was pitch black, and they couldn't see their hands in front of their faces. As the train turned a sharp right corner, the room was illuminated with strobe-like light, and for a split second, they could see what lay within. It resembled a locker room, filled with rusty lockers, wooden benches, and old, yellowish mining uniforms hanging from meat hooks from the ceiling. Dirty, soot-covered, and emanating the smell of burning flesh. Some uniforms had headlamps on their helmets, revealing a gruesome image of the gas masks underneath. If Jake didn't know better, he would have thought there were still living bodies inside the uniforms‚Äîthey looked so bloated and muscular.

""Fuck, they really put a lot of effort into the design, didn't they?"" Kate whispered to him.

""Macabre, considering what happened back in Ravenwood,"" he retorted.

As they crossed the room and the shrill rails slowly drove them through a tattered fabric curtain into the next room, Jake turned around and could have sworn he saw one of the mining uniforms jerk its head toward him. Jake's stomach lurched. The new room was slightly better lit. It was lined with mirrors; on the left and right, even on the ceiling, the smooth surface reflected the dim light around the room. The mirrored walls were partially cracked, fogged, and stained with old rust. When Jake looked into the mirrors, his heart almost stopped. He didn't see the reflection of himself and his friends, grinning happily in their train car, but rotten, half-charred versions of their bodies. The faces in the glass were gray and puffy, with black, sunken eye sockets. Skin hung in shreds, teeth were exposed, as if they'd been dead for a long time and left to decay.

""Um, guys, can you see what I see?"" Jake stammered, without looking away.

""What the fuck!"" he heard quietly from the seat next to him, and Kate's hand tightened around his.

""Shit, how do they do that? Must be some new technology or something,"" Elijah said in amazement.

""Eww, I look really ugly, babe, please don't look,"" Stella squealed indignantly.

For a brief moment, Kate thought she'd seen Zoey's disfigured face in one of the mirrors next to her. Her face was covered in blood, and a huge gash gaped under her left eye, which, upon closer inspection, was missing. But that was hardly possible. Even the best artificial intelligence in the world couldn't simply make a copy of the face of someone waiting for them outside the ghost train and recreate it inside. Could it? For Jake's taste, the mirror images looked far too real and detailed to be some kind of filtered artificial intelligence. No matter which mirrors they looked in, a grotesque image of themselves stared back at them from every corner of the room. The ghost train creaked slowly onward, and Jake's unease continued to grow. Kate's hand was also starting to feel a little sweaty, and they exchanged nervous glances. They were enveloped in pure blackness, and the train slowly began to pick up speed.

""I think we're going downhill,"" Kate said.

The car now accelerated at a rapid pace, the tires squealing, and the track elements rattled loudly against the steel walls.

""Hold on tight!"" Jake yelled.

The car stopped abruptly, and the four friends were thrown roughly against the car's iron paneling.

""Damn, are you all okay?"" Jake asked.

""I think so,"" Stella stammered.

""Looks like the tracks end here,"" Kate said thoughtfully.

""I think we'll have to walk the rest of the way. In many ghost trains, you ride a bit and then must walk the rest yourself. That adds to the scare factor,"" Elijah grinned, his fun still on.

The car stopped in front of a large iron gate covered with yellow tape reading ""Danger - do not enter.""

""Should we really go in there?"" Stella asked, who now seemed to have her own reservations. ""Of course we'll keep going, we have no other choice. There's no way back, or do you want to climb up the tracks?"" Elijah answered his girlfriend roughly.

Elijah held the barrier tape up so the others could climb underneath.

Jake removed the wooden bolt that served as a lock, pushed against it with all his strength, and with a deep rumble, the heavy iron doors began to move. Rust trickled in small flakes from the hinges as the metal slowly opened. The sound echoed through the ghost train's corridor like a dirge. A rush of stale, sulfurous air poured out, so thick that it crept over the cars like a living thing. Behind it lay a room that looked not like a ghost train mockup, but like real doom: an old mine shaft. The walls were supported by rotten wooden beams, blackened with the smoke from past blasts. Chains hung from the ceiling, swaying as if someone had just tugged on them. A faint, reddish light glowed from deep shafts, as if the fires of the earth still burned beneath.

""We must be deep underground, I think this was a real mine, guys,"" Jake murmured.

""How did they get permission to open a ghost train here?"" Stella asked, surprised.

""Guys, I think I know where we are,"" Kate whispered. ""We were just recently studying the mine burn at the old coal mine in 1961 in history class, look."" Kate pointed with trembling fingers to a black metal sign nailed to a wooden beam above them, which read ""Shaft Number 9"" in flaking lettering.

¬†

#                          Chapter 4 ‚Äì Shaft Number 9

""The mine burn accident happened in this shaft decades ago!"" Jake emphasized.

""This is all getting too much for me, I want to get out,"" Stella whimpered hysterically.

""We have to stay calm, babe, this is still a licensed fairground attraction. Why else would we have gotten ride tokens from a performer, and why else would there have been a neon sign saying 'Real Fun' above the building?"" Elijah explained.

""Come on, let's move on. Going back isn't an option anyway, like Eli said,"" Jake said encouragingly.

The friends moved forward at a slow pace, carefully exploring the mine shaft. Suddenly, a metallic clang echoed from a dark corner behind them. Out of nowhere, a pickaxe shot toward the group at breakneck speed. Jake felt a quick blast of cold air pass by his face and then heard only a dull, mushy cracking sound, like crushing a rotten pumpkin. He turned to his left, sickened by the sight before him. The pickaxe was embedded deep in Stella's head. Bone fragments and shreds of skin protruded from a dripping, bloody crater. Her body slumped limply next to them, leaving a final dull thud. The last sound Stella would ever make again.

""Stella, noooo!"" Elijah yelled loudly.

Kate screamed, her sounds amplified tenfold through the narrow mine shaft like an echo. Jake looked back to the corner from which the pickaxe had shot out and got goosebumps. Dark figures crawled out of the darkness. Charred, bony bodies in torn yellow mining uniforms moved slowly toward them.

""Is that Luke?"" Jake stammered to Elijah and Kate.

One of the zombie-like creatures had the same blond hair and stocky build as their friend, only missing a single tuft of hair, his skin ashen and charred, and his face unrecognizable. Jake narrowed his eyes and could see what was written on the embroidered name tag on his chest: ""Littler.""

""How is this even possible?"" Kate screamed.

""Fuck, they killed Stella. I'll finish those bastards,"" Elijah sobbed angrily.

Suddenly, the figures jerked to their feet and began to move forward with unnaturally fast movement. Their half-dead bodies jerked inhumanly in all directions, teeth chattering, and bones scraping against each other.

""Run, quick!"" Jake yelled.

He pulled Elijah back by the shoulder, took Kate's hand, and they ran as fast as they could down the dimly lit shaft. They heard death behind them, seeking their lives, and they didn't think for a second about looking back or stopping.

""There's another iron gate ahead!"" Elijah screamed.

They ran as fast as they could toward safety.

""It's stuck, help me.""

The three of them pushed against the heavy iron gate, which burst open with a loud creak. They stumbled onto a gravelly, damp, moss-covered floor.

""The gate!"" Jake shouted.

In a flash, Jake and Elijah turned around and closed the gate just in time before the undead creatures could reach out their claws.

""That was a damn close call,"" Jake breathed. ""Listen, bro, I'm so sorry about Stella."" He patted Elijah's shoulder, who was staring dejectedly at the ground, choking back tears.

""What kind of sick supernatural shit is going on here?"" sobbed Kate. ""Those things were never performers or even human.""

""You know what they say about the Ravenwood Faire. People have disappeared here over the years. Maybe there's an old curse on this place, and if someone discovers it, the victims will get a piece of their lives back,"" said Jake ominously.

""That's all nonsense,"" Elijah cursed. ""There are some freaks who killed my girlfriend, and when I get out of here, I'm going to burn the whole place down!""

""Oh, and how do you explain these charred bodies and zombie faces?"" Jake argued with him. ""They already took Luke. Didn't you see his face?""

""Stop arguing, that's not getting us anywhere. Let's get out of here as quickly as possible,"" Kate replied.

Only when they looked around did they realize where they had landed. Thick ground fog lay over a small clearing within a wider mine shaft. Weathered gravestones with rotting wooden crosses protruded from the gravelly, mossy ground. A cold breeze hissed through the shaft, and an eerie tension hung in the air. They walked slowly forward and took a closer look at the gravestones.

""Um, guys, these have Luke and Zoey's names on them,"" Jake stammered.

He pointed to two freshly filled graves lying next to each other. The earth smelled wet and rotten, and the gravestones actually bore the words Luke Littler and Zoey Crawford.

""This can't be true!"" Elijah growled desperately. ""How could there be graves with Luke and Zoey's names down here? They couldn't possibly have known we were coming here tonight.""

""Guys, I have something to tell you. I thought I was just imagining it earlier, but when we drove through the mirror room, I could have sworn I saw Zoey's face in one of the mirrors,"" Kate confessed.

The three of them stared dejectedly at the two gravestones when Elijah noticed something out of the corner of his eye.

""Our names are on here,"" he breathed, his voice shaky.

A few meters away, four open, freshly dug graves gaped, their names engraved on the gravestones like death notices. They read: ""Here rests Jake Parker, Kate Hudson, Stella Reed, and Elijah Johnson. Victims of the 1961 mine disaster.""

""What does any of this have to do with us? This is completely insane!"" Elijah growled deeply.

Above them, the rotten beams cracked, as if the entire mine were collapsing under their weight. Suddenly, they heard a dull hiss‚Äîthen a jet of flame shot out of one of the side shafts. The heat hit them like a blow. The narrow passage transformed into a burning tube.¬†

Black smoke poured from the cracks, and with every step, the floor grew hotter, as if a furnace were raging beneath it. The three of them ran, as if on cue, into the opposite shaft, which led uphill. Just before a junction‚Äîso close to the exit‚ÄîKate tripped over a protruding stone at the bottom. Elijah had already run ahead, but Jake, just ahead of her, grabbed her hand. In the blazing embers behind them, he saw something dark rising from the depths. A figure, featureless, black as shadows, with only two glowing eyes that sparkled like coal. A bony arm shot out and grabbed Kate by the ankle. She screamed, clawing at the ground, tearing furrows in the dust. Jake tried to hold her, but the figure pulled her down with an unworldly strength. One last look, a piercing scream, and then Kate disappeared into the ravine below. The fire leaped up, devouring her echo, and the shaft echoed only with the crackling of flames.

""Kate, noooo!"" Jake screamed.

Elijah grabbed him under the arms and pulled him upward.

""Come on, we have to keep going, or the shadows will grab us too,"" he yelled.

""I don't care,"" Jake snapped back, sobbing.

Elijah was much stronger than him and didn't give him a chance to break free. He dragged him the last few meters up, where they tumbled through molderingly nailed boards to freedom. Jake and Elijah lay panting on the cool grass, covered in dust and soot. Cold air blasted through his sweat-soaked sweater, and the suddenly captivating silence pounded in his ears. Jake had only one thought in his head: he had to save Kate, even if it was the last thing he did. He turned on his side, contorted in pain, and looked at the entrance to the old industrial ruin. The lettering was still buzzing above the building, individual letters glowing brighter than others, sometimes the ""R,"" sometimes the ""N"" flickering. Thick fog distorted the writing for a split second, and a shadow seemed to hang over the sign. The letters shifted in his head, rearranging themselves, as if the word had been waiting to be recognized from the very beginning. Suddenly, it dawned on Jake ‚Äì the words ""Real Fun"" were an anagram and actually meant ""Funeral."" That evening, the story of the six friends would end forever. Only, the old coal mine hadn't been able to embrace all of them. The gravestones with their names on them, the connection to the 1961 mine disaster, the real inscription on the sign above the fake ghost train that had lured them‚Äîit all made no sense. ""I'm going to save you, Kate‚ÄîI know you're still alive‚ÄîI'm coming,"" and, exhausted, Jake's eyes closed, and he sank into a deep, gloomy faint.",1,1756123424.0,Creepystories,0,1.0,False

A lot of times it‚Äôs not the big furniture pieces but small interior mistakes that change the entire vibe of a room. 
Here are 3 of the most common ones people make..

1. Curtains hung too low
When curtains start just above the window, they visually cut the wall and make the room look short. Hanging them from the ceiling or as high as possible instantly adds height and creates a more spacious feel.

2. Rugs that are too small 
A tiny rug under just the coffee table makes the furniture look disconnected. The rule of thumb is to pick a rug large enough so at least the front legs of your sofa and chairs sit on it. This makes the space feel cohesive and anchored.

3. Poor lighting 
Overhead lights alone create harsh shadows. Adding layers with floor lamps, table lamps, or sconces brings warmth and balance.

Fixing these three simple mistakes can transform your living room without needing to buy all new furniture.

# üß™ Carol's Personal Experience

My friend Carol ‚Äî a freelance course designer I met at a digital marketing meetup in Melbourne ‚Äî recently tried¬†[HeyGen Avatar IV](https://ecowebdesign.co.uk/heygen-official)¬†after I mentioned it over coffee.

She‚Äôs constantly churning out onboarding modules and explainer videos but hates recording herself. Like, truly loathes it.

She used the platform to¬†**generate a talking avatar from a photo**¬†for a client intro video. No green screen, no awkward rehearsals ‚Äî just a headshot she took on her balcony and a script she‚Äôd already written.

The avatar blinked, paused, and even tilted its head slightly, like it was really thinking between lines.

Her favorite part? The voice clone. She uploaded a sample of her own audio, and HeyGen nailed her intonation. It was surreal hearing her speak through a digital version of herself ‚Äî more expressive than she expected, with no weird uncanny valley moments.

She did mention one hiccup: the avatar‚Äôs mouth movement lagged ever so slightly on a longer clip. It wasn‚Äôt awful, but it was just enough to make her redo that take.

Still, as Lena put it, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs miles ahead of anything I‚Äôve used before, and faster than waiting on edits from a video guy.‚Äù

For someone juggling multiple projects, HeyGen gave her a way to¬†**make a video using AI and anyone's face**¬†that felt polished ‚Äî without spending her whole weekend doing retakes.

# üßç Output Quality & Realism

This tool delivers¬†**lifelike AI video creation**¬†that doesn‚Äôt feel stiff or plasticky. The avatars actually breathe, blink, and pause like real people.

If you're chasing authenticity without hiring a human, this is as close as you‚Äôll get for now. It beats anything you‚Äôd expect from a budget solution.

A¬†**realistic avatar creator using AI**¬†used to be wishful thinking ‚Äî now it‚Äôs just a browser tab away.

# ‚úÖ Pros

The market is navigating key [SPY](https://flic.kr/p/2rp2D1h) levels of 646 and 636 with mixed sector performance and significant news flow including Barclays upgrading Altria's price target, Blackrock filing for a coffee IPO, and positive compliance news from CYCU on NASDAQ. The EU is progressing with its digital stablecoin initiative while CSX announces an international deal with BNSF.The President announced an investigation into furniture tariffs.  Upcoming earnings from PDD and SMTC will be closely watched along with FOMC data, New Home Sales, and Fed speakers Logan and Williams. Volatility remains elevated with VIX and VVIX showing uncertainty, while defensive sectors like XLP underperform. Analyst sentiment reflects cautious optimism with a balanced view on market direction.
SPY support is at 636 with resistance at 646. Technical analysis shows a Money Flow Index above 50, indicating positive inflows, a Directional Movement Index with the +DI higher than the -DI, and a strong ADX, confirming upward trend strength. Price remains above the Displaced Moving Average, signaling sustained bullish momentum if maintained.

Regarding major earnings reports, PDD Holdings is expected to report earnings with mixed expectations focusing on international e-commerce growth, potentially causing volatility in the consumer discretionary sector premarket. Semtech Corporation will also report, with the semiconductor industry‚Äôs strength as a key focus and possible premarket impact on tech sector sentiment. Both reports may influence broader sector rotation, especially in e-commerce and semiconductors. 

Traders are closely watching upcoming FOMC statements, New Home Sales data, and Fed speakers Logan and Williams for insights on inflation and the economy. Interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as financials and real estate could see moderate reactions depending on Fed commentary. 

Inflation data remains moderate, supporting a cautious inflation outlook that encourages selective risk-taking in consumer staples and discretionary sectors. Trading strategies should focus on dip buys in sectors affected by inflation fears but showing fundamental strength. The EU advancing a digital stablecoin project signals regulatory acceptance of digital currencies, potentially benefiting fintech and blockchain sectors globally. Additionally, CSX announced a new international services deal with BNSF, strengthening the logistics sector.

1mzokne,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonVine/comments/1mzokne/conscious_mindful_vine_use_strategies/,"Conscious, mindful Vine use strategies?","I was invited in early July and i went through all that excitement-disappointment-frustration-accepting phases. I managed to get to over 50% of Gold threshold within two months in review numbers, with excellent insightfulness rating. I still need to get more reviews in to make it to gold. But from now on, I am trying to do conscious, mindful consumption via Vine, trying to get what I actually need or want, those that would add joy and peace to my life, not chaos (too much stuff), annoyance(junk, low quality stuff), anxiety(FOMO/ETV/review queue), and guilt (waste). And not to be swayed by impulsive FOMO. 

Here are my struggles:
- I am in a decluttering phase in my personal life, and Vine initially wasn‚Äôt very helpful for obvious reasons. 
- I also feel bad about creating too much waste and garbage not just from the junks you end up with but also from packaging. I know Vine now has preferred delivery date options to consolidate deliveries but with the frenzy of getting things while available I don‚Äôt even end up looking at any options. 
- I got quite a few junks from Vine I feel terrible throwing away, cos they are technically brand new and I don‚Äôt want to be so wasteful. 

Here are strategies I am using to deal with my struggles:

- Get organizers: I am getting good high quality storage/organizing products from Vine. Like nice glass storage jars, nice boxes, baskets, shelves. etc that are not plastic junks. I got a few items that really helped organize my kitchen so far, I am hunting for more (could we ever get good wooden furniture like a dresser some day..??) 

- Get upgraders/replacers: I am trying to get items that can replace my old, bulky, falling-apart stuff I should have let go years ago. I got a nice minimalist dish drying mat to replace my old bulky drying lack; a pretty corner lamp to replace the 20-yr-old lamp that came from my ex 15 years ago; a new dual-function vegetable peeler to replace my 10-yr old dull and rusty ones. This helps not just for upgrading/replacing what I need, but also to let go of things I feel sentimental about or feel guilty about throwing out. 

- Focus on specific hobby items: Big part of the benefit of Vine I am trying to leverage is to add ‚Äújoy‚Äù factor. So while I am decluttering, I can be more specific about things that can enrich my life. I am into plants, coffee, and cocktail making these days, so I look for items that I need or would like to have for those things. I do daily keyword searches and I admit I did get a few things I didn‚Äôt need or don‚Äôt use‚Äî e.g., I got a very nice french press but I only make/drink espresso; I got excited about a electric smoker for cocktails I found on Vine and got extra wood chips but I don‚Äôt really like them once I tried them; I got too many nursery pots I don‚Äôt need because they came as a set; I got a few fun ‚Äútools‚Äù for plant propagation that is just really decorative pieces. But trying these out and thinking about them, how these items fit in and expand my enjoyment for my hobbies add joy to my life, so I am happy I got Vine to do it with less guilt. 

- Reduce impulse buys elsewhere: I am not the no-buying-month type of person (that‚Äôs why I need decluttering lol). If I want something that would add joy to my life and I can afford it, I buy it. But actually being invited to Vine helped me be more patient and intentional about my purchases, especially around hobbies and necessities that I don‚Äôt need urgently. I used to put things on Amazon carts and think about it but sometimes I just search and get it on spot before I forget (and forget that i ever wanted it). Now I think through if 1) i really need it; 2) I need it urgently; 3) if so I feel comfortable paying the full price, and if the answer to any of these is a no, I put it on my Vine search list and look for it regularly. 

I haven‚Äôt quite figured out how to deal with the guilt of throwing away junk items and all the packages (I also feel bad for the amazon delivery person and my doorman who has to deal with all my packages). What are your strategies? Any suggestions? 

All in all, Vine came at the just right timing when I have time and frankly needed distraction, and can‚Äôt afford a lot, and I am really thankful for it. And while I haven‚Äôt been posting/commenting a lot here, I am both a baby Viner AND baby Redditor, I find this community incredibly helpful and supportive so I am grateful.

He was nice enough, our time was fine, but it was one of those situations where if he'd asked us to get drinks again, I probably would've said yes just to see (sometimes a first meeting could just be a bit awkward), but I wasn't necessarily going out of my way to text him again, if that makes sense. We chatted a bit via text afterward, but then the conversation just sort of petered out. 

When I saw him out at a coffee shop this weekend, he was a bit frosty. He texted me afterwards to apologize for ""being cold,"" but explained, ""it was a shock seeing you after ghosting me."" I looked back at our correspondence. We'd literally texted a couple of niceties after the drink, but didn't make any concrete plans and the conversation ended with him saying ""My week's been super busy, but looking forward to the weekend,"" which like yes, I could've replied to, but I've forgotten to answer actual questions from very good friends before and needed some prompting. 

I brought this up to some friends, and the group was split on whether this was ghosting or not. I've always considered ghosting when someone you have a somewhat established relationship or repertoire with disappears and ignores you multiple times, and was surprised that some friends (people I consider sane/well balanced) said that no, ghosting is going out with someone and them giving you no definitive answer about what they want out of the interaction.

After weeks of wearing these, I found myself with a love-hate relationship. There's a lot to unpack about these sporty sneakers, so let's dive in.

**Comfort and Breathability**  
Sliding into these shoes for the first time felt like a gentle hug for my feet. Constructed from breathable mesh, they performed exceptionally well during my morning jogs and evening walks. The ventilation kept my feet dry, even during a sweaty cardio session. I wore these to a fitness class that usually has my sneakers feeling swampy by the end, and the airy fabric really lived up to the hype. At home, my sister tried them on for a quick run, and even she remarked how light and breathable they felt‚Äîshe's notoriously picky about gym shoes.  

**Highlights**  
- The lightweight mesh construction significantly reduces foot fatigue.  
- Exceptional breathability keeps feet dry during long use.  
- Ideal for daily wear as well as high-intensity workouts.

**Midsole Cushioning and Resilience**  
I‚Äôm someone who spends a good chunk of the day on my feet, and the EVA midsole deserves a shoutout for its cushioning. The first time I slipped these on, it felt as though I was walking on tiny pillows. That spongy, rebound effect isn‚Äôt just comfortable‚Äîit felt like I had an extra spring in my step while running errands. While I genuinely appreciated this feature, I did notice after a couple of weeks that the midsole seemed to compress slightly. It‚Äôs still decent, but the initial ‚Äúcloud-like‚Äù bounce faded a little.  

**Durability and Traction**  
The rubber outsoles on these shoes are nothing short of fantastic. Designed with grooves for added grip, they performed admirably on a damp park trail I walked a few times. Whether jogging on pavement or skipping through a slick gym floor, these sneakers provided trustworthy traction. However, I did take them on a light hiking trip, and the soles‚Äô durability fell a bit short when it came to rocky terrain. A small scuff or two appeared within the first hour. Shoes billed as multipurpose should hold up better here, in my opinion.  

**Easy Slip-On Design**  
Who else hates lacing up shoes every time they need to make a quick trip out? These sneakers come with a pull-on closure that made slipping them on a breeze. Whether dashing out the door for a coffee run or leaving the gym after an exhausting workout, the convenience of this simple design won me over. A friend commented she wished she'd known about this feature when shopping for something easy to wear post-surgery. One small note‚Äîindividuals with wider feet might find the fit a little snug at first, though the mesh material accommodates with time.  

**Applicable Settings**  
From gym classes and running errands to casual nights out, these shoes pull double duty. I‚Äôve worn them while walking my dog through uneven sidewalks, during a trip to the grocery store, and they even paired decently with my athleisure outfits for a laid-back brunch. That said, if you‚Äôre planning on using them for activities involving rough terrains or extensive trail running, the shoes might not rise to the occasion as confidently.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Midsole cushioning can lose its bounce over time.  
- Not ideal for rocky or challenging terrains.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other popular athletic shoe brands like Nike, Adidas, or New Balance, these sneakers hold their own in the comfort department but lag slightly behind in durability. While Nike Pegasus, for instance, offers superior cushioning longevity and materials tailored for long-term runs, they come at a much higher price point. Similarly, Adidas Cloudfoam shoes provide comparable comfort but edge out the Feethit model in terms of style versatility and sole longevity. However, the Feethit running shoes outrank competitors in terms of affordability and ventilation, making them appealing for those seeking budget-friendly options.  

**Best Value**  
On the value-for-money spectrum, these sneakers perform admirably for their price bracket. The standout lightweight and breathable build make them an excellent contender for anyone prioritizing comfort during workouts or long days on their feet. While these don't outperform premium running shoes, their affordability and features combine into one solid package. For budget-conscious shoppers looking for a capable pair of sneakers for multipurpose use? These will definitely do the job.

There are men who wrestle lions, men who climb Everest, and men who cross oceans in tiny boats. And then there is Charlie, professional gardener and full-time chew toy of the atmosphere.

Every morning, Charlie straps on his leaf blower‚Äîa machine designed, allegedly, to move grass, hedge clippings, and leaves in one straightforward direction. A simple task. A reasonable expectation. Except Charlie is followed everywhere by omni-directional wind: a force of nature so pettily vindictive it feels less like weather and more like a cosmic prank that never gets old.

It doesn‚Äôt matter which garden he enters. The moment he pulls the trigger, whoosh. The air erupts into seventeen directions at once. North, south, diagonal, inward, outward, backward, and at least two trajectories best described as ‚Äúpersonal attacks.‚Äù I once saw a clump of grass blow east and west simultaneously. Isaac Newton would have had a nervous breakdown on the spot.

The weather forecast? Irrelevant. ‚ÄúCalm and sunny‚Äù is simply code for ‚Äúbrace yourself, Charlie.‚Äù Clouds gather on cue, like spectators settling into their seats. The Wind Committee cracks its knuckles. The match begins.

At first, it toys with him: a tuft of grass blown neatly into a flowerbed, a handful of hedge clippings that suddenly levitate skyward like they‚Äôre auditioning for Peter Pan. Charlie steadies himself, angles the blower, mutters, ‚ÄúNot today.‚Äù But then the finale hits. Piles scatter into neighbouring driveways, hedges instantly re-decorate themselves, and Mrs. Donnelly‚Äôs car receives a fresh, crunchy coat of foliage that looks suspiciously deliberate.

It doesn‚Äôt matter how he pivots. Every direction he turns, omni-directional wind is already there, waiting‚Äîlike an overly dramatic ex who has memorised his schedule and refuses to let him move on.

I once saw him enter a garden, march straight to the centre of the lawn, and spin in a slow circle with the blower, firing in every direction like some kind of gardening exorcist. The result? A perfect halo of grass clippings around him, like he was the patron saint of futility. If nothing else, it was visually impressive.

Charlie, bless him, does not surrender. He storms patios like a general, curses flying, while omni-directional wind scoops them up and delivers them down the street to confuse passing schoolchildren. His hat has become a nomadic entity, last sighted in a Lidl car park three miles away. Yet he straps it back on each morning, determined to win the unwinnable.

Clients, naturally, are thrilled. They see their lawns tastefully ‚Äúdappled‚Äù with clippings, as if Charlie has invented a bold new gardening movement‚ÄîRustic Scatter Chic. They pay him cheerfully. Charlie accepts the money like a soldier accepting a folded flag.

And so the battle rages on. Day after day. Garden after garden. Charlie versus omni-directional wind. A gardener locked in eternal combat with an enemy no rake or blower could ever conquer.

Legends are already forming. Children whisper of the man who fights the invisible giant. Old men nod solemnly when they see him trudging by, blower in hand, eyes haunted yet unbroken. Historians will one day write: There was a man who stood against the air itself. And he lost. Constantly. But by God, he showed up.

Tomorrow he will return to the field. Tomorrow omni-directional wind will meet him once again. And tomorrow, from my porch with my coffee, I will bear witness to the world‚Äôs most pointless epic.

‚ÄúGood luck, Charlie,‚Äù I‚Äôll whisper. ‚ÄúMay the breeze never run out of new ways to ruin you. Because frankly, I‚Äôm running out of coffee.‚Äù",1,1756122674.0,lawncare,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a student on a tight budget ‚Äî so I‚Äôm trying to make the most of a very cheap setup while keeping an eye out for cheap second-hand upgrades. I‚Äôd love some guidance on how to get better shots with what I‚Äôve got, and what (if anything) is worth upgrading in the meantime.

Budget: Hoping for \~¬£400 for the whole setup, but I'm willing to spend much more for a genuinely good setup ‚Äî I‚Äôm just waiting for the right second-hand espresso machine and grinder to pop up so I can upgrade everything. Because of that, I‚Äôm not keen on sinking much at all into this current setup. That said, I‚Äôm open to advice if there‚Äôs a better choice of grinder or machine than the ones I mention below:

**Current setup:**

* Machine: De‚ÄôLonghi EC146B (thermoblock, vibration pump, 51mm baskets, cost me ¬£30)
* Grinder: De‚ÄôLonghi KG79 false burr grinder ‚Äî modified to grind finer (was a gift, I wouldn‚Äôt buy this myself)
* Hand grinder: Timemore Chestnut C2 (great for brew, but doesn‚Äôt go fine enough for espresso)
* Basket: stock unpressurised, but the design is terrible ‚Äî it tapers at the top so my 51mm tamper can‚Äôt properly reach the puck.

https://preview.redd.it/fb2ftbt4m5lf1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2da623d8faf8c70eb9adb2c2f397c92843c114de

The recommended manufacturer doses are 7g (single) and 12g (double). I usually add \~2g extra so I can actually tamp with my tamper instead of the awful plastic one built into the machine. The steam wand is, frankly, the worst on earth, but I make do.

Because my beans and setup are so budget, I mostly drink milk drinks such as flat whites and lattes. Straight espresso isn‚Äôt very enjoyable with what I‚Äôve got.

**What I‚Äôm thinking about:**

* Should I get a normal basket + new portafilter so I can at least tamp properly?
* Or would it make more sense to get a pressurised basket, so I could use my C2 hand grinder instead of the KG79?

Additionally, does anyone have any UK-based recommendations for cheap but decent beans? (I don‚Äôt even want to admit where I get mine).

**Future plans:**

I‚Äôm keeping my eyes peeled for a second hand or faulty Fellow Opus grinder and either a Rancilio Silvia or Gaggia Classic (hoping to do the Gaggiuino mods). That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm hesitant to sink money into upgrades for my current setup. However, second-hand bargains don‚Äôt pop up every day, so I‚Äôm stuck with this for now ‚Äî but I‚Äôm open to recommendations for different machines/grinders if they‚Äôre a better value path.

Even though my gear is frankly awful, I still enjoy better coffee than the ¬£4 coffee shop espresso down the road who have all the gear but no idea.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

1mzo5ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricVehiclesUK/comments/1mzo5ti/scotland_road_trip_write_up/,Scotland Road Trip write up.,"Just finished a driving holiday;  Cambridgeshire -> Ayr; came out of it entirely unscathed without any route-planning; just followed the built-in GPS. 

I didn't worry too much about optimising how much I paid or anything;  even at the highest price we paid, it's no more expensive per mile than diesel so I just went with whatever charger was most convenient.  We stopped every couple of hours, and charged up whenever we stopped just to keep it simple.

Cambs -> Scotch Corner.

No charging required en-route.  Pulled into the Holiday Inn at Scotch Corner, straight into an empty charging space.  Project EV App required,  never used it before so installed it while the rest went to check in,  I caught them up before they'd finished checking in so it was pretty seamless, lets you add a payment card and pay as you go.  

Scotch Corner -> Richmond
Car hadn't finished charging when we went out for dinner,  the council car park was free after 6 with a contactless payment charger in the car park (cheaper than at the hotel);  left the car to top itself up while we went to Elixir (bloody lovely Italian, huge portions)

Richmond-> Ayr
This is the only time we encountered bad things on the trip really!

Road out of Richmond was at a standstill, so we went for a 'take the next exit and see where we end up' detour, which added an essential charge to the journey.

Pulled into Tesco (Annan, I think?) on the way for lunch, the contactless payment charger wasn't working; and the other was Pod Point,  you have to buy credits in ¬£10 increments on the app but there's no way of knowing how much you'll need to spend, and nothing on there that tells you how to get any unused credits back. I can't imagine why they don't just let you put in card details and take the money.  Charge wasn't critical at that point so we just carried on

We had our one bad services experience on the motorway at Welcome Break Abington;  50% of the public chargers were broken, the rest were in use and there's nowhere to wait so you sort of have to lap around hoping one frees up.  There were a whole swathe of Tesla-only superchargers that were not in use at all but we couldn't use.  I hung around here for too long getting annoyed, should have just given it up immediately and carried on. 

Having eventually given up on Abington,  we carried on to Cairn Lodge which was like day and night in comparison;  loads of spare chargers, all contactless and loads of room near them to stop if they were full;  weight lifted, car was charged back to 80% and the sun even came out;  nice cakes in the caf√© too. 

Around and about Ayr:

Didn't drive much around Ayr so only needed to charge for the trip back; having fallen out with the Monta app on a previous campsite trip, this time it redeemed itself, all went through absolutely fine, no problems with it accepting payment and found and activated the charger seamlessly. (both of which were problems before)

Ayr -> Lytham 

Took a scenic route back through the Galloway Forest Park; I enjoyed the twisty roads a little too much, one of the passengers felt a car sick so we stopped off at Costa in Dumfries for a break and a snack (sight of the Bakewell tarts suddenly cured and gastric issues...); topped up the battery while were were there (contactless, no bother); Twatted my thumb putting the charging cable back away,  I'll take that responsibility for that one.

Really good to see Tebay services advertising they have chargers AND to see the price advertised too,  this should be the standard!    Didn't go for Tebay as it was queuing onto the carriageway,  stopped off at Killington Lake for a McLunch; had plenty of spaces at their GridServe chargers;  so I topped up while I was there.

Hotel had a load of Project EV chargers (now I've got the app, so it was a breeze) they were filled with non-EVs but it's a tiny car park so can't really blame them;  they were wedding guests who'd gone by bedtime so moved the car and set it charging overnight.

Lytham -> Home
A1M was crawling, so pulled into the new services at Barnsdale and topped the car up while we had a coffee at Starbucks; definitely worth just diving into a services at the moment as chargers are popping up faster than the apps update (certainly my car's GPS). 

All in all, no bother at all, lots of fun and I think the main lesson from the biggest headache of the trip was to leave a little leeway to just give up on a charging stop and carry on until the next.

The emphasis is not just on making kitchens look beautiful, but on creating spaces that work smarter, not harder. In a German kitchen, technology is an enabler of efficiency, sustainability, and comfort. From intuitive appliances to clever storage solutions, every detail is crafted with precision. This fusion of innovation and engineering has positioned German kitchens at the forefront of modern home design, setting benchmarks that the global market often aspires to meet.

## Smart Appliances for Modern Living

One of the most striking aspects of modern German kitchens is the integration of smart appliances. These devices go beyond basic automation; they learn user preferences and adapt accordingly. Imagine a coffee machine that remembers how you like your espresso or an oven that suggests cooking times based on your recipe. Energy efficiency is also a hallmark, with appliances designed to consume less power without sacrificing performance. Many even connect to smartphone apps, allowing remote operation. This level of interconnectivity transforms cooking into a personalized, stress-free experience, making daily routines smoother while reducing environmental impact.

## Precision Engineering Meets Digital Innovation

The synergy between precision craftsmanship and digital technology is what sets [German kitchens](https://www.leichtwestchester.com/) apart. Built with meticulous attention to detail, these kitchens incorporate touch-sensitive controls, hidden LED lighting, and motorized drawers. Materials are chosen not just for aesthetics but for their durability and ease of maintenance. Even storage spaces are designed with intelligent organization systems, ensuring that everything has its place. By merging traditional craftsmanship with state-of-the-art features, German kitchens offer a harmonious blend of timeless beauty and cutting-edge functionality. The result is a workspace that feels both luxurious and remarkably intuitive.

## The Rise of Voice-Controlled Cooking

In recent years, voice control has become a game-changer for home kitchens. In many [kitchen showrooms Westchester](https://www.leichtwestchester.com/kitchens/) locations, visitors can test systems that allow them to preheat ovens, adjust lighting, or play music using simple voice commands. This hands-free convenience is especially valuable when your hands are messy from cooking. By integrating with smart home ecosystems like Alexa or Google Assistant, German kitchens are becoming part of a connected living experience. Voice control also enhances accessibility for people with limited mobility, making it a technology that is as inclusive as it is innovative.

## Sustainability Through Smart Technology

Beyond convenience, modern German kitchens also prioritize sustainability. Many designs include water-saving faucets, energy-efficient induction cooktops, and refrigerators that optimize cooling cycles. These features don‚Äôt just reduce utility bills‚Äîthey actively contribute to a smaller carbon footprint. Technology enables precise control over resource usage, ensuring that nothing is wasted. Some manufacturers are even experimenting with AI-powered waste management systems that suggest recipes based on food nearing expiration. By combining sustainable engineering with modern tech, German kitchens are helping homeowners live more responsibly without compromising on style or comfort.

## Augmented Reality in Kitchen Design

Technology‚Äôs influence on German kitchens begins long before installation. Augmented reality (AR) is now being used to help homeowners visualize how their kitchen will look and function. With a smartphone or tablet, customers can walk through a virtual version of their future kitchen, adjusting cabinet colors, lighting schemes, and appliance placements in real time. This immersive planning experience removes much of the uncertainty from design decisions, allowing for more precise customization. AR tools also streamline communication between clients, designers, and installers, reducing the risk of costly mistakes and ensuring the final result matches the initial vision.

## The Integration of Wellness Technology

German kitchens are also embracing wellness-focused technology. Air purification systems built into range hoods, circadian rhythm lighting that adjusts to the time of day, and water filtration taps are becoming standard features. These innovations promote a healthier cooking environment and enhance overall wellbeing. Even the acoustics of a kitchen are considered, with sound-absorbing materials integrated to create a calmer atmosphere. By prioritizing both physical and mental health, German kitchen technology goes beyond mere utility‚Äîit creates spaces where people genuinely enjoy spending time, whether cooking alone or entertaining guests.

## Adaptive Lighting Systems

Lighting plays a pivotal role in the atmosphere and usability of a kitchen. Modern German designs often incorporate adaptive lighting systems that adjust brightness and color temperature automatically based on natural light levels or specific activities. For example, a bright, cool light is ideal for food preparation, while a softer, warmer glow sets the tone for a relaxed evening meal. Many of these systems are app-controlled, allowing for fine-tuned customization. The use of energy-efficient LEDs ensures that this technological sophistication remains environmentally friendly.

## Connectivity for the Future

As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to evolve, German kitchens are positioned to integrate even more deeply with smart home systems. From refrigerators that can order groceries to cooking surfaces that recognize cookware and adjust heat accordingly, the possibilities are expanding rapidly. Many of these advancements are modular, meaning homeowners can upgrade individual components without overhauling the entire kitchen. This forward-thinking approach ensures that a German kitchen purchased today can stay relevant and technologically competitive for many years.

## Conclusion

The role of technology in modern German kitchens is far from superficial‚Äîit is deeply integrated into the very essence of design, functionality, and sustainability. By blending precision engineering with digital innovation, these kitchens deliver unparalleled convenience, efficiency, and beauty. From voice-controlled appliances to AR-driven design planning, the advancements in this space are transforming how we cook, interact, and live. As technology continues to evolve, German kitchens will likely remain at the forefront, setting the gold standard for what a truly modern kitchen can be.",1,1756121790.0,ModernLuxuryKitchen,0,1.0,False

Hey r/Entrepreneur,
I've been following this founder Cameron Nuckols for a while now, and his journey with [Deformity](https://deformity.com) is honestly one of the most grounding stories I've heard in this space.

**We had a conversation recently that stuck with me, and I think it'll resonate with anyone grinding through the messy middle of building something.**

Here what he said:
**We're at around $2k/month now. Hit $33k this year which covers maybe a quarter of my kids daycare costs. It's not 'quit your job' money, but it's progress.**

That's how Cameron started our chat. No inflated metrics, no ""crushing it"" language. Just honest numbers from someone actually in the trenches.

Here's the part that got me: When Deformity was making just **$58 MRR**, Cameron got an acquisition offer for $35,000.

Think about that for a second. You're months into building, barely making coffee money, and someone waves a check that could clear your credit card debt or fund your next idea.

He almost took it.

I thought, 'What else would I do? Start another SaaS and go through this whole painful process again?

**But he said no and kept building.**

This year alone? Deformity generated roughly that same $35k in revenue.


Cameron's launch story is the opposite of every success post you see here:

- **Launch day:** Complete crickets

- **Waitlist:** Went cold while he took too long building  

- **Initial growth:** Manual, exhausting work

His early ""growth hacks""?
- Jumping into Reddit threads where people complained about form builders
- Cold DMing competitors' users
- Shipping bug fixes *the same day* people reported them
- Starting his own subreddit (helped with SEO, barely moved the needle otherwise)

No viral moments. No ProductHunt #1. Just grinding it out, one user at a time.

Three things drive most of their growth:

1. **Cold outreach** (still their most reliable channel)

2. **Reddit engagement** (sharing journey + genuinely helping in comments)  

3. **Product-led growth** (their ""Runs on Deformity"" badge on free forms converts really well)

**""Most founders give up when things don't explode after launch. Sometimes the only difference is just sticking with it long enough for the results to compound.""**

This isn't about Cameron being some genius or finding a secret growth hack. It's about **persistence compounding over time**.

How many of us would have taken that $35k? How many would have quit after the failed launch? 

I probably would have.
We're constantly fed stories about overnight successes and hockey stick growth. But most real businesses look more like Cameron slow, steady progress punctuated by moments of doubt.

His story reminded me that:
- Not every launch needs to be a home run
- Failed launches aren't actually failures if you keep building
- Sometimes the best decision is the boring one: just keep going

And if you're in that messy middle right now, feeling like your launch failed maybe it didn't. Maybe you're just earlier in the story than you think.

P.S. - Cameron documented his full journey with numbers and details in a [Starter Story](https://www.starterstory.com/subscribe?via=google) interview. Worth reading if you're looking for realistic founder stories vs. the usual highlight reel.

1mzo0mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wildcampingintheuk/comments/1mzo0mj/trip_report_from_my_first_solo_camp/,Trip report from my first solo camp.,"So first I want to say thanks for all the comments on my photo :) 

I had a great trip. It's not very far from home I can walk in in just about an hour / hour and a half. It's about 2 maybe 3 miles from home. 

So I was with family during the day and left about 5pm. I walked up and arrived by about 6 630. I had scouted the site a few weeks before on one of my fitness walks (attempting to be less chunky üòÑ). So when I arrive I set up just my chair and my stove and made a coffee.

On the way I could see a massive plume of smoke in the distance so I called the fire brigade just incase someone needed it. 

I waited till about 745 8 to set up the tent where I took the picture. Then  cooked a meal bag. I had the wayfarer chilli very tasty would recommend. 

So as the light began to fail I sat in my chair whisky in my hip flask and listened to lord of the rings (my favourite books I'm a geek i know). About 10ish I climbed inside the tent and got nice and comfy. I will admit the tent felt bombproof obviously it was only in nice weather and not to much room but it felt really secure. Unfortunately due to my own inexperience It was pitched slightly on a slope.

I'm impressed with the tent. It doesn't feel cheap or substandard. The poles are the heavy bit but I might replace them down the line with aluminium ones if possible. But I have to say it's a great size and comfy to be inside. I can't fully sit up inside but I only went into the tent when I was ready to sleep.

So I really love my air mat I used. I'm a side sleeper and a chronic twitcher when I sleep so needed a nice air pad. A friend of mine  suggested the unigear p3. It's great has an r rating of 2. I also am a super hot sleeper so I only had a poncho liner as a blanket but I was very comfy and not cold at all. But for the colder months I will use a proper sleeping bag. Also I used a decathlon inflatable pillow wich I modified with a bungy strap to keep it on the air pad.

Had a good night's sleep and woke up early. It was about 445 so I just sat in my chair made a coffee and just took in the morning. 
I then packed up my kit and finished my coffee and walked back home :) 

Had a great time. I've wild camped before with friends but this is the first time on my own and it's really motivating to go do it more. I started walking for my fitness to loose weight then started looked at wild camping as the next logical step. But now I know I can go on my own I'm definitely going to be getting out there more for other camps. 

If you made it this far on my rambling thanks for reading  :)

1mznwr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryGiftsf/comments/1mznwr3/the_future_of_gifting_what_if_luxury_came_on_an/,‚ú® The Future of Gifting: What If Luxury Came on an AI Gift Card Instead of in a Velvet Box? ‚ú®,"Okay so I stumbled onto this idea today and my brain won‚Äôt stop circling around it: an **AI gift card.** Like‚Ä¶ imagine unwrapping not something physical, not just some digits that let you buy shoes or coffees, but actual access to personalized intelligence.  

What would that even look like? A slip of sleek aluminum with a generated code, and instead of ‚Äú$100 at Nordstrom‚Äù it reads ‚Äú100 hours of customized AI assistance.‚Äù That sounds futuristic and oddly intimate, right?  

I mean, think about it: one person‚Äôs card could unlock an AI life coach, another‚Äôs could be all about personalized story recommendations (hello, https://goodnovel.org/), and someone else might use it to handle logistics, budgets, meal plans. It‚Äôs so different from just throwing money in a pretty wrapper.  

- What if you gifted *creativity* instead of consumption?  
- What if instead of grabbing a handbag, you gifted a personally trained language tutor AI?  

We always talk about luxury as something that glitters‚Äîjewels, bags, champagne‚Äîbut what if the new luxury is time? Attention? Uniquely tailored thought?  

And of course, my head keeps asking weird questions:  

- Is an AI gift card a luxury because it‚Äôs rare right now?  
- Or will it become considered tacky once every other app store starts selling ‚ÄúAI credits""?  
- Will it feel too cold? Too utilitarian? Too *technical* to be a gift with heart?  

Personally, I get excited at the idea of giving my brother a sleek, heavyweight ‚Äúcard‚Äù where he can cash in on designing his own sci-fi stories, sparring with an AI dialogue partner, or browsing customized reads from sites like https://goodnovel.org/. It feels like giving the key to a new library, but the library is alive and bends itself around the reader.  

And yet honestly, I‚Äôm still confused too. Would opening a digital pass to tailored algorithms have the same emotional punch as, say, sliding velvet from a box? Maybe that‚Äôs exactly the tension ‚Äî luxury used to be about rarity of materials, but maybe the rarity of tomorrow is **personalization.**  

- Imagine a birthday gift that literally becomes smarter each time the recipient engages with it.  
- Imagine being handed a portal to your own digital concierge, bound into a single card.

Maybe an AI gift card is the modern equivalent of gifting jade or gold tablets: an absurd flex in one era, an everyday thing the next. Right now, though, perched at the dawn of it, it feels oddly magical, futuristic, a little daunting, and wholly compelling.

1mznwpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trendinfo/comments/1mznwpx/when_hot_products_stop_being_flashy_start/,When ‚ÄúHot Products‚Äù Stop Being Flashy & Start Redefining Everyday Life üî•‚ú®,"Okay, so hear me out because I‚Äôm actually kind of buzzing with excitement over this whole thing... what even defines a ""hot product"" right now? Like, is it about social media hype, actual usefulness, or just that crazy sense of *I need this right now* that comes rushing in when you see it trending?  

I‚Äôve been watching how certain everyday products suddenly explode, and honestly, it gets confusing. Sometimes it‚Äôs gadgets, sometimes skincare, sometimes just something practical that weirdly takes off. Is it just me, or does ‚Äúhot‚Äù not always equal flashy? Sometimes the most surprising ‚Äúhot‚Äù items are the practical ones that actually solve a pain point.  

- I mean, think about it... there are mugs that keep coffee warm for hours. Boom‚Äîviral.  
- Or the rise of portable blenders‚Äîout of nowhere I started seeing them literally everywhere.  
- Then you get stuff like weighted blankets, which still baffle me in the best way.  

So here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm kind of scratching my head: we chase trends for novelty, but sometimes the real ‚Äúhot‚Äù move is finding something quietly powerful that sticks with your lifestyle. Something meaningful rather than hype-driven.  

And this one seriously caught my attention lately:  

**Top On Sale Product Recommendations!**  
- **Ankle Fracture Fixation, Night Use, Daily Walking Brace, Foot Drop Fracture Fixation Support and Fixator**  
- Price Now: **USD 48.79** (Original price: USD 57.40, *15% off*)  
- üîó **Click & Buy:** https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ompIzT7  

Wait‚Äîwhat?? A medical support brace sitting in the category of a trending ‚Äúhot‚Äù product blew my mind a little. Like, are we hitting a new space where ""hot"" trends are also about practical health/comfort fixes rather than purely aesthetic or electronic wins? Because if so, it makes *so much sense.*  

Hot doesn‚Äôt have to mean flashy or cool anymore. It‚Äôs smart. It‚Äôs accessible. It‚Äôs built to make your life easier and more comfortable. Honestly, I kind of love that shift.  

- Something you can use daily = durable value.  
- Helping you walk better at night or during recovery = legit improvement to quality of life.  
- And the discount factor? Always a cherry on top.  

Now I‚Äôm spiraling, seriously. If a brace can be trending, what does that mean for the *definition* of a hot product? Are we moving into an era where viral popularity reflects need and wellness, not just entertainment?  

Or am I overthinking and just excited about scoring 15% off something clever and practical?

He won‚Äôt pick up after himself if it‚Äôs not on the floor. His desk is messy, has things pushed across it and piled randomly. Trash sits on it, trash falls under it, and it just looks so messy, which really bothers me when I give the courtesy of keeping my side super clean. He will also pile his trash in my trash can and then not take it out. I had Covid and was stuck in bed and literally had to go take it out because his trash was falling off the trash can. It was that full, he piled it that high.

There‚Äôs also a few other habits that really bother me. His noise level is super high, some nights he will stay up until 12 am and leave the main light on and I have to try and ‚Äúconvince‚Äù him that he can turn that off and turn on a lamp, and he‚Äôll try and come back and say ‚Äúwell I only have 20 more minutes of work‚Äù. He also sits in the dorm all the time, so I don‚Äôt even understand why he‚Äôs waiting until 11 pm to start his work. He rarely goes out except for 3 classes, and he takes some online classes in our dorm. There‚Äôs so many times I come back though and he‚Äôs just sitting there doomscrolling. Other nights though, he will go to bed at 9 when I‚Äôm not even back yet, and then ‚Äúcomplain‚Äù when I come in at 10:30 and go brush my teeth because ‚Äúopening the door‚Äù wakes him up. As if he doesn‚Äôt do that 10 times at 6 AM an hour before my alarm goes off. When he wakes up, he sets things down super loud, almost like slamming them. He opens and closes drawers really fast. When he leaves, he will leave the door open and look around to make sure he got everything, and then leave, which just pours light in from the hallway directly into my eyes. 

There‚Äôs only two things that have *really* rubbed me the wrong way recently though. I have misophonia, which is basically a disorder where repetitive noises ‚Äútriggers‚Äù an array of emotions that can cause me to break down, etc. His snoring is one thing that has nearly already caused me a panic attack. On top of that, he told me he didn‚Äôt snore when we first talked about rooming together. Also, he does this thing that almost looks like this ‚Äútic‚Äù of some sort, where he sits on his bed, goes criss-cross applesauce, and then he will takes his hands and push down on his bed sheets, and he will sit here doing this for 5 minutes straight. It drives me absolutely insane. The second thing was really just something he said. I originally purchased everything in our dorm. The decor is all mine, the tv is mine, mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, utility cart, snacks. Like I have put a *good* amount of money into it. When I bring back groceries he will be like ‚Äúoh what did you get *us*‚Äù. And just yesterday he came up to me and was like ‚Äúhey, can you get a mirror for our dorm? Thanks.‚Äù And I was like ‚Äúfor what‚Äù and he said ‚Äúoh well I wanted one, but you can use it.‚Äù Dude, first off, I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôd be paying for it, what do you mean I can use it?? It‚Äôs mine?? This isn‚Äôt a charity service. Mind you, his mom and dad are both very wealthy. His mom is in real estate, his dad‚Äôs a full time doctor. My parents make way less than his do, and yet I‚Äôm somehow expected to be doing the investment?? The only reason why I got all the stuff in my dorm is because he wouldn‚Äôt. He wouldn‚Äôt get a tv when I asked, a cart, groceries, literally all he got was a 100$ futon. ",0,1756121121.0,college,0,0.4,False

As someone who constantly finds themselves juggling between work trips and spontaneous vacations, I decided to test this product to see if it really delivers on what it promises. The claim of making hand-laundering simple and efficient intrigued me, especially since hotel laundry services aren‚Äôt exactly budget-friendly. Over several uses, I was able to get a good sense of both the positives and negatives with these packets, so let‚Äôs dive in.

**Compact and Travel-Friendly Design**  
What really makes these detergent packets stand out is their ridiculously compact size. Packing them in my carry-on felt like adding no weight at all, a feature I came to appreciate on trips where space was tight. Measuring just 3.31 x 2.6 x 0.55 inches and weighing a mere 0.63 ounces, it‚Äôs amazing how something so small can pack enough cleaning power for a whole load of laundry. The three packets included provide a quick fix for short trips or emergencies, but I imagine it would be a top-tier option for light packers in particular. 

[Check Tide Travel Sink Packets Size 3ct price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b01iainl1i/)

**Ease of Use**  
Using these packets isn‚Äôt just easy; it‚Äôs almost foolproof. For someone like me who has zero patience for instruction manuals, I fully appreciated how straightforward the process was. You just fill a sink or small basin with warm water, toss in a packet, and let it dissolve. From there, washing a few items becomes almost second nature. I used it on a variety of clothes‚Äîincluding shirts, undergarments, and even a delicate scarf‚Äîand each time the detergent handled the dirt without fuss. Though there is no fancy scent left behind, the fresh, clean smell was satisfactory for daily wear.

**How It Performs on Tough Stains**  
This detergent claims to tackle tough stains with its Acti-Lift formula, and I gave it situations to prove itself. Coffee stains, everyday dirt, and even makeup spots on a collar were manageable to a degree, but it struggled a bit with grease stains. I noticed better results after additional scrubbing, though this might defeat the ""add-and-go"" convenience some people would be looking for. Still, it‚Äôs hard not to admire the precision with which one little packet worked for smaller loads. This is not the kind of detergent for a hardcore mess, but for freshening up clothes in a pinch, it‚Äôs quite reliable.

**Boons**  
- Extremely lightweight and compact, perfect for travel  
- Pre-measured packets avoid detergent wastage  
- Safe for septic tanks and devoid of phosphates, making it eco-conscious  
- Ideal for small loads or hand-washing delicate fabrics  

**Pitfalls**  
- Limited to three packets in one pack, not ideal for long-term use  
- Struggles with heavy grease stains, requiring additional scrubbing  
- Might not leave a strong, lasting scent for scent lovers  

**Product Contenders**  
Travel laundry detergents are surprisingly common in the market, so I naturally had to think about how this one compares to others. Against direct competitors like Dr. Bronner‚Äôs Liquid Soap, Tide‚Äôs packets have a portability advantage. While Dr. Bronner‚Äôs is multi-functional (you can use it as shampoo or for dishwashing), I found it to be too runny for precise laundry use. Another contender, Woolite Travel Sink Packs, performs just as well but often leaves a more fragrant finish. However, Tide‚Äôs cleaning performance felt slightly more robust overall for removing stains. If you prioritize cleaning efficiency over multi-use functionality, Tide has an edge against these competitors.

**Worth Every Penny**  
From a price perspective, these are absolutely a bargain for their utility in travel or emergency situations. While some people could argue that regular detergent in a small container might do the same job, I find the pre-portioned convenience of the packets unbeatable. The ability to wash items without resorting to purchasing hotel-specific laundry services could make this a long-term money-saving choice for frequent travelers.

1mznt0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiatalHernia/comments/1mznt0c/6days_post_surgery_hiccups_and_burps/,6days post surgery - hiccups and burps??,"So far it's all smooth sailing. 
I'm buying tinned soups and heating then blitzing. 

Today was my first poop (tmi!) and it's much paler then pre-surgery . 

My journey to surgery was both long, and unexpectedly short. 

I had (have?) been losing iron stores steadily for years. Taking iron supplements daily for 30 years. This February I dropped below 120 in iron stores. Gas/cols every 6 months. Nada. Iron goes down. Had gas/col 4 weeks ago, followed by iron infusion. 
(Spoiler alert - anaphylactic after 3mls). So 2 units blood - and iron goes over 120. 

So I go camping, and wake up on last Saturday feeling a bit weak. Staggered to the long-drops snd staggered back. Had to stop , breathless, both ways. Used my dog's harness as support. Returned to campsite and sat for a good rest. Managed to stand and move long enough to feed my dog, and get changed to day clothes. 

Everything was hard. Breathless, no energy. Sat, decided what to do, did one thing. 

Moved to Ute drivers seat and turned on engine to warm up. . Found a packet of fruit tingles and ate them, thinking it might be low sugar. Drank more water, got RTT closed and drove with dog to cafe after calling hubby to collect me. Looked in my mirror and my lips are grey, my inner eyelids are nearly white. 

Going home , now 2pm (everything started happening at 9am) and get my husband yo stop the car twice for me to vomit - and it's black, gritty vomit. Decide to go to ED. NearestED is about 2 hours away. 

Finally get to ED and I'm tachy. Bloods show iron is 97. 

Sunday morning, iron has dropped to 73. Although I chose the private ED based on my gastro specialist, she's not available until Tuesday. 
Sunday I get another 2 units of blood, cat scans. Monday another Gas/col. nothing obvious, but I managed to read my patient file and discovered they found Cameron's lesions. Temp specialist comes on and tells me that most of my stomach is in my chest. My specialist tells me that she thinks my stomach gets irritated as it slides through the (large) hiatus hernia.. 
so Tuesday I meet my surgeon, and she says the best thing is fundoplication.  And it will happen in 3 hours. 

Now I'm 6 days post surgery. 
The tight chest is gone, just a little pain over my sternum. I'm eating roughly every 3 hours, a mostly liquid diet of soups, yogurts, yogo, scrambled eggs, and icecream with a pineapple compote I made last night for fibre. 
Baked sugar snap peas for crunch snd gibte. Lots of water. Maybe a glass or 2 of wine. Tea, coffee, hot chocolate. 
And a block of white chocolate melted on the tongue. 

I'm feeling good. No reflux! My poop is lighter coloured (still on iron). Hiccups feel weird, and I'm farting for England. 

See my GP tomorrow, and the surgery nurse Wednesday (along with the haematologist who was charged with working out my iron deficiency). 

I'm wondering if, I didn't vomit and see the ""coffee grounds"" vomit, would we know where I was losing blood? 
Would the blood be digested ? 

Anyhoos. This is me. 

Reading everyone else's experiences here before my surgeon came to talk to me really helped. So Thankyou.

Anyway, I thought that I'd be fairly quick, so I didn't do much makeup or dress up. A few hours later, two guys show up, one of them is another bartender at this bar. We all get to talking and the evening drags on longer than anticipated. My friend finishes her shift and we four move to another bar. 

As the night drags on, I say I should head home soon as I got work today, and I need to use the bathroom and I'm not passing enough to use the women's restroom. One of the guys just looks at me and deadpan says ""I didn't know you were trans until you made jokes about it."" 

What? WHAT?! I finally coerce some more of his thoughts and neither of the guys clocked me as trans. They knew my friend had a trans friend, and they connected the dots when I made some trans jokes.

I did the normal begging and negotiating at first(all with barely a response.
He at first wanted our place and told me to leave. Two 3 worded texts btw. His mum(also horrendous with anything emotional) listened to my tears then gently coaxed me into getting my own place. Even sent me rental pics.
Then they took our kid and fobbed off to Spain for 2 weeks.
I packed, fixed little things, looked at some places, gently got our kid used to the idea of ‚Äúour new special place‚Äù. Actually felt some hope
Then the landlord emails to tell me my ex had taken his name off the lease and if I‚Äôd like to stay month to month. 
I was so crushed(again). Furiously asking him what the hell? Then his mum, as he just ignores everything.
Then I apply for benefits. Nope, he already has. Listing himself as primary Which is absolutely laughable. I try to talk to him‚Ä¶ignored. Literally called his mum as he‚Äôs sitting in the room trying to sort it, as she‚Äôs begging him to take the phone and talk. He wouldn‚Äôt.

1mznrdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByteTheBits/comments/1mznrdj/explore_the_best_wireless_keyboard_macally_for/,Explore the best wireless keyboard Macally for compact setups,"The Macally Small Wireless Keyboard, model B0F124RMPF, has been a surprisingly handy gadget in my daily workflow. Initially, I was skeptical about how a compact keyboard without a number pad would fit into my routine, but after weeks of testing, I can confidently share my experience with this device. From its portability to its reliable wireless connection, this keyboard has some solid features that stand out, though a few quirks did surface during my usage.

**Design and Portability**  
This compact keyboard was clearly designed with minimalists and on-the-go users in mind. The lightweight build and slim profile make it incredibly portable. Throwing it into a backpack doesn‚Äôt feel like adding any noticeable weight, which I appreciated during a recent trip where I needed a functional keyboard on hand. Despite its smaller size, it doesn't feel cramped while typing. The 78-key layout is thoughtfully designed, providing all the essential keys while trimming the unnecessary bulk, though I'll admit, adjusting to the absence of a number pad took me some time. The white finish adds a clean, modern aesthetic to my desk setup, though I wonder how well it will fare against long-term wear and accidental coffee spills.

**Reliable Wireless Connectivity**  
The inclusion of a 2.4GHz USB-A dongle ensures a dependable wireless connection between the keyboard and devices. During my daily testing, I noticed no disconnections or lag while typing. It was particularly helpful when paired with my laptop and occasionally my TV, where it worked seamlessly from several feet away. This plug-and-play functionality eliminates the need for drivers or additional setup, which is a huge win for tech novices or those who just want simplicity. 

[Check Macally Small Wireless Keyboard B0F124RMPF price on Amazon.](https://solarpark.org/p/b0b88tqzhg/)  

**Typing Experience and Functionality**  
While the keyboard achieves its compactness, Macally didn‚Äôt skimp on functionality. The keys, though small, offer decent tactile feedback. Typing for extended periods felt comfortable enough, though the shallower key travel could take a little getting used to, especially if you're transitioning from a full-sized mechanical keyboard. The addition of 12 shortcut keys was a lifesaver for productivity, allowing quick access to volume, playback controls, and other essential functions. I often use these shortcuts while working on reports and editing documents, which saves a lot of back-and-forth motions between the keyboard and mouse.

**Battery Efficiency**  
The device runs on a single AAA battery, which is conveniently included in the box. I appreciated the built-in on/off switch that conserves power when the keyboard isn‚Äôt in use. Despite my excessive daily use, the battery life seems impressive so far. However, I‚Äôm curious how well it would hold up over several months, especially compared to rechargeable keyboards, which save the hassle of replacing batteries.

**Benefits**  
‚Ä¢ Lightweight and travel-friendly  
‚Ä¢ Plug-and-play with no driver hassles  
‚Ä¢ Smooth wireless performance with minimal interference  

**Areas for Improvement**  
‚Ä¢ Lack of rechargeable battery might bother eco-conscious users  
‚Ä¢ Missing number pad can be inconvenient for heavy data entry users  
‚Ä¢ White color, while attractive, might be prone to stains  

**Alternative Products**  
Compared to other compact keyboards like the Logitech K380 and the Arteck HB030B, this wireless keyboard holds its own ground in terms of simplicity and functionality. While the Logitech K380 boasts multiple device pairing via Bluetooth, it comes at the cost of slightly laggy connections at times. The Arteck HB030B, on the other hand, offers a built-in rechargeable battery and backlighting for nighttime usage, though it feels a bit less sturdy compared to this one. The Macally keyboard strikes a balance by delivering a straightforward option with reliable connectivity, though its lack of backlit keys might be a dealbreaker for some.

**Worth Every Penny**  
When it comes to value, it‚Äôs clear this keyboard isn‚Äôt targeting high-end users but rather those seeking an affordable, simple, and efficient solution. Its cost aligns well with its features, making it a worthy investment for students, professionals, or even casual users who need an additional keyboard for multiple devices. That said, if the absence of advanced features like backlit keys or multi-device pairing doesn‚Äôt bother you, this compact option is a no-brainer for anyone looking to optimize desk space while maintaining functionality.

1mznqcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mznqcv/same_city_long_distance/,Same city long distance,"Hello,
I‚Äôm mainly looking for some advice from people who have made it for 5+ years in their relationship and people in long distance relationships but all advice is welcome at this point. 

I (25f) and my partner (26m) have been together for four years officially and we‚Äôre approaching the 5 year mark soon. He‚Äôs changed jobs within the past year and a half and while it‚Äôs a better job opportunity for him I‚Äôve been seeing him less and less. For context I used to be able to see him 4-5 days a week before the job change because he was in the same city and now I‚Äôm only seeing him in person once or twice a month if that. I understood that because of his higher position he has more responsibilities and that he has to be at work more often and it‚Äôs about a hour to an hour and a half commute depending on traffic. 
We live in the same city but our schedules are pretty much opposite when it comes to our work schedules. I‚Äôm not faulting him for having to work nor do I want to but when he gets home and I‚Äôm up he just seems to disappear off the face of the earth and he says he‚Äôs too stressed and too tired to stay up which from work I understand but we‚Äôve had to reschedule seeing each other 2 times now and this last time was just missed as well but not rescheduled because he didn‚Äôt even have the decency to tell me he couldn‚Äôt see me. I‚Äôm honestly not sure what to do. 

I want to be together and I‚Äôve spoken to him at least twice now and he‚Äôs claiming that he wants to be together and he‚Äôs not avoiding me but too many outside complications keep stopping him from being able to schedule time towards seeing me.

I think I‚Äôm starting to develop some resentment towards him because of all of the false promises of spending time together and it falling through between planned trips and just spending the night or stopping to get a cup of coffee together. I don‚Äôt remember the last time we went on a date and I absolutely loathe long distance relationships but that‚Äôs all this is at this point and it‚Äôs not something I signed up for because of this exact reason. I talk to my therapist about it all and she‚Äôs telling me it‚Äôs not as simple for him to compartmentalize his time and responsibilities as it is for me but it‚Äôs starting to feel like an excuse. I‚Äôve raised 5 children that weren‚Äôt mine and it came with the consequences of something or someone being neglected and all I‚Äôm asking for is an hour a week just to see him in person grab a coffee or brunch while he‚Äôs working later in the day but it‚Äôs seeming like that‚Äôs not something he can do at this point while maintaining his own social life and his regular responsibilities. 

I don‚Äôt want to start hating this man but I‚Äôm really tired of feeling like I‚Äôm being forgotten while I‚Äôm waiting and waiting and waiting for him to follow through with his promises. How much grace does someone need when things seem to be out of their control? My dad says it‚Äôs a reluctance to communicate with me because my partner doesn‚Äôt want to have to cancel plans again because of the disappointment he knows is coming but I‚Äôd rather be told at 7pm that something can‚Äôt happen then 11pm the day of when I‚Äôm waiting for two days for plans to be solidified because he can‚Äôt just break it off so I‚Äôm not feeling like a dog waiting at the door for their human to walk in. I‚Äôm tired of having to bring up how I feel because I feel that twice is already too many but if it‚Äôs worth it I will try again because I feel he‚Äôs worth it I‚Äôm just ‚Ä¶..not sure. I need an adultier adult.

How am I supposed to know if this is just a hardship I‚Äôm supposed to go through to have a long lasting relationship vs I‚Äôm just waisting my time? How do you know when the person you love is the person you‚Äôre supposed to be with despite everything and as a woman how much grace does someone give when my patience is gone and my faith in him is gone and he‚Äôs still here out of the love I somehow have left?

A cup of coffee can cost fifteen to twenty minutes of minimum wage work. Groceries are no better. Basic products are sold at inflated prices with the excuse of transportation costs, but the truth is much of what is offered is low quality.

Malta is proud to welcome visitors from all over the world. Tourism is important for our economy. But for people who live and work here, daily prices are becoming impossible to manage.

Delivery apps like Wolt and Bolt are pushing near-expiring items at full price. Potatoes and vegetables are often sold already sprouting or carrying germs. Families are paying premium prices for food that in many cases should be discounted or withdrawn. In other countries supermarkets have created ‚Äúnear end of life‚Äù aisles, where products close to expiry are sold cheaply so that people with fewer means can still eat with dignity. In Malta this practice is absent. Instead, high prices are justified as if they were inevitable.

The minimum wage in Malta in 2025 is about 961 euro per month. In France it is 1426 euro. In Spain it is 1184 euro. Despite this gap, many basic items in Malta cost the same or even more. A cappuccino in Valletta can be 3.20 euro. A pint of beer is often 5 to 6 euro. A simple lunch is 18 to 22 euro. These are prices you expect in Paris or Madrid, but with much lower wages. For someone on the Maltese minimum wage, one coffee can represent fifteen to twenty minutes of work.

Tourism should not harm residents. When basic goods are sold only at tourist rates, locals are excluded from their own caf√©s and restaurants. Workers paid close to minimum wage cannot keep up with this system.

This is a system that punishes the poor twice. First with wages that are lower than most of Europe, and second with food and drink that cost as much or more than in Paris or Madrid. Workers and residents should not be treated as tourists in their own country.

What is needed is not strict control but fairness and transparency. Reference prices should be published for essentials like coffee, bread, water, beer and basic meals. Service charges should always be shown clearly on menus and never hidden on the bill. Tourist zones and residential zones should be recognised and priced differently. Authorities should act against abusive or misleading practices.

This is a respectful request to the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority and the Malta Tourism Authority. Support a system where visitors and residents can both live well. A fair Malta is one where a cup of coffee does not cost half an hour of work.

Why there no:

Fair Pricing Unit within MCCAA, with:

Mystery shoppers to check for hidden charges.

A hotline/app where citizens can report abusive pricing.

Public lists of businesses fined for misleading prices.

Incentives for good practice:

‚ÄúFair Price Certified‚Äù label for businesses that follow guidelines.

Promotion by the Tourism Authority as ‚Äúethical and transparent‚Äù.

Publish as a ‚ÄúFair Price Index‚Äù (similar to how Eurostat publishes cost-of-living data).

Define Reference Ranges

For each product, define a normal acceptable range (e.g., espresso ‚Ç¨1.20‚Äì‚Ç¨1.80 in local caf√©s).

Allow higher prices in tourist areas, but always display clearly why the price is higher (rent, service level, etc.).

If a shop or restaurant charges 50‚Äì100% above reference without justification, it gets flagged.",6,1756120749.0,malta,1,1.0,False

Death drops 2.) skin color sans CK 3.) randomize brahmin gender on spawn 4.) make things spawn with modded guns/ equipment (automatic pipe rifles, calibrated 10mm, etc').","TLDR is the title, nothing but degeneracy beyond this point. You wanna know what ADHD is like? Yesterday I didn't know wtf Creation Kit even was, and I'd at some point tentatively made a patch in xEdit that changed the player's race while barely understanding what I was doing and following a YT video step by step.

Watch this.

Our story begins with a mod that's kinky and interesting in concept but, I'll be blunt, could use a squirt of elbow grease. (NSFW) [Krazyman's Brahmin](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/52709?tab=description) converts *certain* brahmin into naked warrior women, and also turns Cricket's brahmin into a gryla cuz funny. The headcanon is that these ladies have succumbed to an irradiated strain of mad cow disease and actually believe themselves to be brahmin.

Works with (SAFE) [Milk that Brahmin!](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12175)

Specifically the non-gorrila brahmin affected are as follows: EncBrahminClarabell (found @ Abernathy Farm), CaravanDWBrahmin, CaravanCarlaBrahmin, CaravanLucasBrahmen, and EncBrahminPack (one of these gets summoned whenever you assign a settler to a supply route).

For anti-canabalism reasons, Krazyman's mod doesn't change wild brahmin or, in Krazyman's own words, ""Food Brahmin"". Makes sense, this measure allows you to go get some ribeye without butchering another human and consuming their flesh in the process. Great idea, 10/10, not a thing wrong with it.

Now check my username and guess who my favorite author is. That's your hint on which way I'm going.

The patch I'm working on aims to do several things, a few of which it already does and a few I could use a hand with (see title). Below is what the patch either does or aims to do once I figure it out.

\- 1.) ""No penguins in the Arctic."" (Help wanted)

There's an old riddle about a captain that gets stranded in the Arctic. He barely survives on a diet of penguin meat, but eventually gets rescued. Upon retelling his tale, he is informed that there are no penguins in the Arctic. He kills himself the next day. The riddle is: Why?

Answer: What he'd told himself was ""penguin meat"" was in fact the flesh of his dead crew. In desperation, he'd convinced himself it was penguin meat so he could stomach it and survive.

Iguana bits exist in vanilla Fallout 4.

There are no iguanas in the Commonwealth... without (SAFE) [mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/75091).

So naturally, I've opted to reward murderous psychopaths with a murderous psychopath's reward. The intent is to change basically any brahmin that could be at a settlment into a human per similar headcanon to Krazyman's original concept, except now murdering one of them will net you ""iguana"" bits.

Where I need help: I've found the cell of ""INAM - Death item"". Double clicking this cell in xEdit provides a dropdown menu with a list of options, but iguana bits don't appear on this list. I'm also able to right click and edit the cell's contents to arbitrary text, but I'm afraid that simply typing in the editorID & number for iguana bits will crash the game as soon as Fo4 goes to check the cell and finds an unexpected value... an experience I've unfortunately had similar experience to on another experimental patch involving flags I know already exist in the game, but apparently don't belong where I put them. Alas, that's a short story for another time.

/- 2.) ""No milking old women."" (Implemented)

So uh... Krazyman's mod kinda doesn't change much more than the brahmin's race, behavior, and inventory. This means that when the brahmin gets converted to human, the game spawns it in using the default female hairstyle (since no hairstyle is set) and the predefined hair color that vanilla Fo4 already assigns to brahmin... for some reason.

Silver. With 0 thin, 0 fit, 1 fat bodymorph settings. And since NONE of the affected brahmin are given any other data to go off of, ALL affected brahmin are converted to overweight grandmas.

Needless to say, I wound up patching this out about as soon as I got the mod. For anyone else that likes the concept of women you can milk but would rather not encounter this issue, here's how to fix it in Fo4Edit for people who've never used it before (takes like 60 seconds or so once you have Krazyman's mod, not accounting for the time it takes to read a guide open in another window).

===

Launch xEdit, click OK, wait for the loading screen tip to disappear. In the left panel, scroll to ""Krazyman's Brahmin"" and click the + sign on its left to expand it. Next, click the + sign next to ""Non-Player Characters (actors)"", which will give you a list of the different types of brahmin the mod affects. Click whichever of these you'd like to change (no need to change the gorrilla, which would be the one named ""Mighty Joe Young""). With your target brahmin selected, scroll down in the right panel until you see ""HCLF - Hair Color"". Using your prodigious MS Excel skills, locate the cell to the right of ""HCLF - Hair Color"" and beneath ""Krazyman's Brahmin"". Double click this cell, and xEdit (aka ""Fo4Edit"") will popup a big damn window asking if you're sure you need to be fucking around here. Wait for the timer to enable the yes button, click yes (this window only pops up once per time you start xEdit, and exists to keep noobs from irreversibly fucking things up they don't understand. Dw though, you're following a guide so ur gud m8). This accomplished, a dropdown arrow should now exist on the right side of the cell you just double clicked. Click that arrow, and from the menu it provides select the hair color you desire.

Mission accomplished, hair color is now changed. Now click on each of the different types of brahmin in the left panel in turn, repeat the process in the right panel for each of them, hit the X button on xEdit when you're done and it'll promptly ask if you want to save your changes. Hit OK, xEdit will close, now you can boot up Fo4 and observe the fruits of your labor. Ez day.

===

/- 3.) ""Brahmin Gal"" (Implemented)

(SAFE) [Pet Brahmin mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/78625?tab=description).

Mod is simple. You get a pet brahmin. Not much special about it, save only that you can assign it to a settlement, give it a supply route to run, or even assign it to base defense should you so desire. Just a simple, stock-standard brahmin, happy to do brahmin things.

So anyway, the patch I'm working on also converts exactly that pet brahmin into a Brahmin Gal using the lessons I learned from reverse engineering Krazyman's mod.

Would you like a woman that thinks she's a brahmin roaming the commonwealth with another woman that thinks she's a brahmin? Assign Brahmin Gal to a supply route and you'll have just that. Are you instead using the Milk that Brahmin! mod and just wish you could have a mobile source of unpasturized milk (preferably with a *singular* pretty face)? Look no further!

Naturally, this compatibility patch makes it so I actually have *two* authors to get permission from before I can publish anything. If you'd like to implement this yourself and you're new, here's your class in reverse engineering... as delivered by a fellow noob.

===

First things first: CHECK THE FUCKING COMMENTS BEFORE DOING ANY OF THE BELOW. Odds are high that if anyone with a brain made it this far and I fucked up in these instructions, they'll likely have called me on it in the comments. Again, I've known this shit for less than a day, DON'T FUCK YOURSELF OVER BY WHOLEHEARTEDLY TRUSTING ANOTHER NOOB.

Pop open xEdit and follow all the left panel steps up to where you click on the brahmin you want to ""edit""- except you won't be editing anything here this time. Scroll through the right panel and take note of everything yellow or red- those are the specific values that have been modifed (in this case) by Krazyman's mod. Having noted these (and safe in the knowledge you can come back and check anytime), in the left panel go over and hit the + sign next to ""Pet_Brom.esl"", then the + sign by ""Non-Player Character (actor)"", then RIGHT click the only brahmin that pops up. In the menu that pops up, click ""Copy as override into..."". In the OTHER menu that pops up, scroll to the bottom and check the box next to one of the options that says ""\<new file\>.esp"", then click OK.

>Q1: ""Waaaait a minute, why didn't I do this when I was editing Krazyman's mod?""

THAT was a simple af operation with little chance of making the game crash if you got something wrong, and involved changing a single variable. NOW you'll need to change multiple variables, some of which have dropdown menus with lotsa items and plenty of opportunities to misclick and seriously fuck something beyond just getting the wrong hair color. The new .esp you just made is called a ""patch""... basically your own mod made from copy/ pasting content from (in this case) somebody else's mod. So long as your patch is lower in the load order than the original mod, yours will override it. Also, if you fuck up your mod and do something that crashes your game as soon as a brahmin spawns in- which I've very recently done- this makes it so you don't have to reinstall the original mod because that wasn't the file you were editing. It's a safety practice.

Anywho, with your new patch now made (xEdit will force you to name it upon creation btw), scroll down in the left panel and click the + sign next to your patch. Again, hit the + sign next to ""Non-Player Character (actor)"", and click the only option that pops up. In the right panel now, go through and find all the values that were yellow in Krazyman's mod. You've probably picked up on this if you're following as you read, but the values you're changing are all in the far left column, and what you're changing them to is stored in the cells of the column your patch's name appears over. When in doubt, double click at the intersection between the value you're changing and the patch/ mod column you're changing it in (should be the column furthest to the right that still has data in it). If a dropdown menu pops up, EZ day, just select the option you need from the list. If you instead get a gray window pop up with no information in it, close that window and RIGHT click the cell you were changing- there should be either an ""add"" option or an ""edit"" option depending on... stuff. If you get ""add"", click that, and you'll see a small list of new items appear. Double click each, change them to match what Krazyman's mod has them to. If the option is ""edit"", you'll have to type the value in directly, usually a number. Make sure to pay attention to the names of the values you're changing- a LOT are self-descriptive, so you can learn a lot by looking around and seeing what's what.

By the time you're done, you should have successfully converted your pet brahmin into a brahmin gal. If you'd like to name them, in the right panel, find the value ""FULL - name"" and double click the cell in that row under the column of your patch. Type in the name you'd like, and to save at any point go to the upper left corner of xEdit where there's 3 horizontal lines. Click those, click save, and feel free to close the program when you're done. You can now open Fo4 to observe the fruits of your labor. If the game suddenly crashes as out of nowhere, disable your patch and start the game again. If it runs without issue, that means one of the two of us fucked up- either you fucked up in doing what I told you to, or (more likely) I fucked up and told you something stupid or vague. Again, check the comments to find out which of these is the case, or make your own and I'll see if I can help.

===

/- 4.) ""Taste the rainbow"" (Help wanted)

From my admittedly minimal research, this appears to be an age old quest which many have set upon and many others have answered with ""CK"". As mentioned earlier, Krazyman's mod doesn't change much more than it has to, meaning all those obese grandmas are also plain ol' default white. I'm personally a fan of the entire rainbow of the human race with the sole exception of orange people with blond hair (guess my country), so naturally I'd like to change some brahmin gals at roughly random if possible to have a variety of skin tones. Like many others before me, I've already changed the RGB values under ""QNAM -Texture lighting"" and set the alpha to 1, and furthermore gone to ""Face Tinting Layers (sorted)"" and added a layer of data type ""Value/Color"" and index ""1168 SkinTints - Skin tone"", the RGB values for this layer having been set to the same as the QNAM values, ""Template Color Index"" at -1, ""Value"" at 1. Game boots fine, skin color remains unchanged both body and head.

I read yesterday about a bug that used to a possible cause BUT that same bug was easily spotted because it removed the eyebrows of the entities it affected, which is not the case here.

>Q2: ""If you know CK has been recommended to fix this problem, why not use it?""

A2: It's already a miracle I understand xEdit with the minimal excuse of a grasp that I do at this point. Before I launch into Creative Kit, I'd like to have some basic understanding of what I'm fucking with first, and I just frankly don't. I can launch CK, open up Fo4's main files, and I haven't made it to Goodneighbor on this character but there should be two pieces of leather armor waiting to be picked up off the wall in front of the shops once I get there, one propped up on a couple of beer bottles laid sideways. That's it, that's my experience with the program aside from using it as a reference to help me find what different kinds of brahmin exist by editorID without having to scroll through all of xEdit's effectively unsorted list (IK xEdit actually does sort its assets by it's own standard due to some Skyrim-related reasons, but it still aint' exactly alphabatized). I have literally 24(ish) hours of legitimate mod-editing experience to go off here, it's 7am, and I literally did not sleep last night on account of bouncing between research, playtesting, and writing two different versions of this longass post (this version is longer, the other was more unhinged but also long af). I'm open to it if I absolutely have to, but I still have to test if I can just copy Preston's entire existence as a patch, add a female flag, change the editor ID and whatever other shit I need to and paste soon-to-be-her cloned ass wherever there's too much cream and not enough coffee.

Again, the OTHER version was more unhinged. For your own sanity, don't ask.

/- 5.) ""By the Bi"" (Help wanted)

Simple concept. Krazyman's mod only converts brahmin to women. I'd like to get both genders in on the action. Rn I'm trying to get the brahmin Kelly sells you to be male and the brahmin that walk up to your settlement at random to be female, but for some reason I can't even change Kelly's brahmin from brahmin to human. Might be because I've been up too long and fucked something up, might be some unique variable, dunno. WITH THAT SAID, that's only a K.I.S.S. method workaround to the problem, not the solution I'd prefer. What I'd like to do is instead have the game randomly choose whether to spawn a brahmin guy or brahmin gal whenever it would normally spawn any non-wild brahmin. Problem is, again, I'm operating on 24 hours effective experience, no sleep, and a metabolism that can't process coffee (makes my head go 1,000,000mph but COMPLETELY drains the rest of my body of energy. Fucking sucks, and that's from a tablespoon of the stuff.). 

/- 6.) ""Amending the 2nd: The right to mod arms"" (Help wanted)

Again, simple concept, I dunno how to add stocks or long barrels to a pipe pistol in xEdit yet, and I'd like the vault suits I'm dressing these folks up in to be white instead of blue. Any help would be great. Speaking of-

/- 7.) ""Too much dakka"" (Implemented)

I'm on a survival character rn, which of course means part of the appeal is the challenge. Krazyman's mod, aside from just turning brahmin into naked people, also gives them miniguns, supersledges, powerfists, hell, Clarabell pulls a broadsider out of her nethers when threatened... there's no animation for it mind you, but it's not like there's a lotta options to choose from in a birthday suit either.

Naturally this means any threat I'm up against might get randomly dunked on my Carla's handy companion, and when in doubt I can always fall back to a known supply route so the patrolling brahmin gal can wipe out whatever's chasing me regardless of just how outleveled I am. To remedy this, I've swapped out Krazyman's selection of gear for stuff more in line with what your average wastelander would have- pipe pistols, 10mm, and Clarabell's getting a laser pistol in homage to the BoS voicelines Krazyman's mod gives 'er (though said voicelines are also patched out- we walk the freedom trail in this neighborhood).

On top of all this, I've also set ""DOFT - Default Outfit"" to ""Vault81Outfit [OTFT:001103A5]"". Naturally this makes the patch- on its own- safe for work.

...of course this same outfit is one of the two affected by (NSFW) [ALSL Vault Suit Unzipped](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29197), so workplace safety compliance can now be toggled without opening xEdit to do so.

*The global production of advanced technologies ‚Äî from smartphones and electric vehicles to renewable energy and military systems ‚Äî relies on rare earth elements such as neodymium and dysprosium, essential for permanent magnets.*

China‚Äôs rare earths chokehold has triggered not just a supply crisis, but a strategic awakening, forcing democracies like those in the Quad ‚Äî Australia, India, Japan and the US ‚Äî to rewire their mineral dependencies, industrial strategies and geopolitical alignments.

The issue escalated significantly in early 2025, following the re-election of US President Donald Trump and the subsequent imposition of sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports. In response, Beijing announced curbs on the export of rare earths and related magnet components. Immediately, global shipments of rare earth magnets fell to multi-year lows and production lines across the automotive, aerospace and electronics sectors experienced¬†[severe disruptions](https://mailwizz.eastasiaforum.org/index.php/campaigns/wk977jqab7e28/track-url/nk787y6gw4105/8d13757dc9d60a52bb607d818041536c7f040e0d).

By late June 2025, both sides unveiled a limited framework designed to alleviate immediate pressures. But any semblance of stability proved short-lived. Chinese officials disclosed that export licences had been issued only on a limited basis, with each permit valid for just six months. Concurrently, reports emerged of magnet stockpiling within China‚Äôs¬†[Baotou rare earth hub](https://mailwizz.eastasiaforum.org/index.php/campaigns/wk977jqab7e28/track-url/nk787y6gw4105/343eac461d89095286f47390e2bcb3440608ea17), raising concerns about future availability and signalling Beijing‚Äôs continued leverage over global supply chains, even under conditions of diplomatic detente.

Crucially, this is not solely a commercial issue ‚Äì it represents a latent threat to national security. Without secure access to critical minerals, Western defence industries risk cost escalations, procurement delays and degradation of core capabilities.

Amid these disruptions, the Quad adopted a more co-ordinated stance. In July 2025, foreign ministers met in Washington and launched the¬†[Quad Critical Minerals Initiative](https://mailwizz.eastasiaforum.org/index.php/campaigns/wk977jqab7e28/track-url/nk787y6gw4105/9efbde6a348b23e5d4d92bd42a6b6a834841c3b1), a collective effort aimed at reducing strategic vulnerabilities in mineral supply chains. Their¬†[joint statement](https://mailwizz.eastasiaforum.org/index.php/campaigns/wk977jqab7e28/track-url/nk787y6gw4105/064160fa9997b1f9b5375efcdb79533ce6f45359)¬†acknowledged that over-dependence on any single country posed risks of coercion, price manipulation and supply insecurity. The initiative seeks to fund joint investments in mining, processing and stockpiling, with a focus on politically stable and partner-aligned jurisdictions.

Initial indications suggest the initiative is gaining traction. Japan has expanded its lithium co-operation with Australia, and India has expedited its domestic mineral approval processes and signed new bilateral supply agreements with partners in Africa and Central Asia. In Brussels, the European Parliament has increasingly echoed Quad concerns, calling for¬†[greater alignment](https://mailwizz.eastasiaforum.org/index.php/campaigns/wk977jqab7e28/track-url/nk787y6gw4105/e3626f30fb9ee652ed46c2c1dd4d66c465db1dc0)¬†in mineral policy.

Industry actors are also adapting.¬†[Japanese automakers](https://mailwizz.eastasiaforum.org/index.php/campaigns/wk977jqab7e28/track-url/nk787y6gw4105/1fdc68894978ef0cb80402fa1aba005ae9131dbb)¬†are exploring cobalt reserves in Queensland, US and¬†[Australian firms](https://mailwizz.eastasiaforum.org/index.php/campaigns/wk977jqab7e28/track-url/nk787y6gw4105/da7d81f210f60dca659bfe83df75c571c2ec140e)¬†are initiating rare earth projects in Africa, and¬†[Indian companies](https://mailwizz.eastasiaforum.org/index.php/campaigns/wk977jqab7e28/track-url/nk787y6gw4105/3144d78d9e0e530bae41f6260e497e00c582a0ee)¬†are enhancing both overseas partnerships and domestic refining capacity. These developments point to an incipient restructuring of global industrial logic away from single-node dependence and towards diversified, resilient supply ecosystems.

Still, the path to fully realising the Quad‚Äôs ambitions is likely to encounter structural and political obstacles. Divergent regulatory standards, environmental compliance timelines and capacity gaps among member states may slow progress. Each Quad member brings distinct geopolitical considerations. India, for instance, continues to balance diversification imperatives with its longstanding commitment to strategic autonomy.

The capital-intensive nature of mining and refining projects, particularly in frontier markets, also poses financing challenges. Addressing these hurdles will require sustained public-private co-ordination, trust-building mechanisms and frameworks that ensure policy continuity across political cycles. Success will depend on whether the Quad can translate shared intent into coherent and enduring institutional architecture.

What was previously viewed as an inconvenient dependence on China is now recognised as a strategic liability. The focus has shifted from reactive supply protection to proactive industrial sovereignty and geopolitical flexibility. This transformation underscores a deeper structural lesson: that technological capacity is inseparable from material security.

The sudden¬†[scarcity of rare earths](https://mailwizz.eastasiaforum.org/index.php/campaigns/wk977jqab7e28/track-url/nk787y6gw4105/64e466dd9fdd2834d574312c8c17e8724de53c44)¬†has revealed the extent to which global innovation is contingent on unbalanced access to¬†[critical inputs](https://mailwizz.eastasiaforum.org/index.php/campaigns/wk977jqab7e28/track-url/nk787y6gw4105/aeaead3246fb6459ff8d7a173178f21bb6eb8ded). The Quad‚Äôs mineral initiative, though not widely publicised, marks a significant step towards structural co-operation among democratic states. If effectively implemented, it could underpin long-term economic stability and technological leadership across the Indo-Pacific and beyond.

Securing the supply chains of critical technologies requires more than just market mechanisms. It demands co-ordinated policy, cross-border investment and institutional trust. The coming decade will test whether democratic coalitions can extend their co-operation beyond shared values to the material foundations of power. Rare earths may prove not only to be vital commodities but defining instruments of strategic resilience.

# AUGUST 25th, 2025~China introduces new regulations for rare earth supply quotas

*The updated regulations follow China‚Äôs already stringent management over its rare earth industry through a quota system.*  
[China introduces new rare earth supply quota system regulations](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/china-rare-earth-quota-regulations/?cf-view)

[The updated regulations were finalised after a public consultation initiated in February. Credit: Pla2na\/Shutterstock.com.](https://preview.redd.it/ovhbmtdw45lf1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=21afc5b60ed11e9e16487b7190e8774e789ec34d)

China, the world‚Äôs leading supplier of rare earth elements, announced new regulations aimed at overseeing the mining, smelting, and separation of these essential minerals, which are crucial for the energy transition, according to a¬†[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-tightens-grip-over-rare-earth-supply-quotas-2025-08-22/)¬†report.

Currently, Beijing governs rare earth mining, smelting, and separation through a quota system.

According to a statement from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the updated regulations will now incorporate imported raw materials into this quota framework, following a public consultation that commenced in February.

The updated regulations follow China‚Äôs already stringent management over its rare earth industry through the quota system and reinforce its control over the supply chain.

Rare earth elements, a collection of 17 metals, are vital components in a wide array of products, including military equipment, electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, and various consumer electronics.

China‚Äôs dominance in the rare earth market has become a sensitive issue, especially with the country‚Äôs recent move to add several rare earth products and magnets to its export restriction list in April. This was seen as a retaliatory measure against US tariff increases.

In July, China¬†[discreetly issued](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/china-rare-earth-quotas-2025/)¬†its 2025 rare earth mining and smelting quotas without the customary public announcement.

The delay in releasing this year‚Äôs quotas is partly due to the February proposal to incorporate imported ore into the quota system, a move that met with opposition from companies that depend on imports for their raw materials.

In a related development, Russia‚Äôs¬†[exports of precious metals](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/russian-precious-metals-exports-china/), including gold and silver, to China have increased significantly in the first half of the year by 80% to $1bn compared to the same period last year.

This increase coincides with a 28% rise in gold prices this year, influenced by factors such as heightened geopolitical risks, ongoing trade tensions, and strong purchasing by central banks and exchange-traded funds.

# GIVEN ON ~JULY 2nd, 2025~(MARK SMITH) China Has The Pentagon Over A Barrel, But Trump Can Stop It (Mark Smith... ""Tells it like it Is!"")

[China Has The Pentagon Over A Barrel, But Trump Can Stop It | The Daily Caller](https://dailycaller.com/2025/07/02/china-pentagon-trump-taiwan-defense-military/)

[NioCorp's Elk Creek Mine is part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Soulution!](https://reddit.com/link/1mznmu3/video/4z5qi07s55lf1/player)

President Trump and his team recently negotiated a ‚Äúfast track‚Äù deal on Chinese rare earth exports for use in products like automobiles, factory automation and robotics, wind turbines, and other durable goods. That action has helped to forestall more production slowdowns or work stoppages at several major Western automakers, at least for now. Tens of thousands of U.S. workers and their families will be able to better enjoy the upcoming July 4^(th)¬†holiday.

But all indications are that heavy rare earths like dysprosium and terbium ‚Äì elements that enable precision-guided missiles, jet fighters, and radar systems ‚Äì remain quietly bottled up in China‚Äôs new export control bureaucracy. Not surprisingly, reports are that the Chinese military is now playing an active role in identifying and blocking rare earths in both China‚Äôs new export license process and even at shipping ports.¬†

***I have served in the rare earth industry for nearly 30 years. I have seen virtually everything China does to maintain its hegemony over this industry. It comes as no surprise to me that the Chinese military wants to throw a monkey wrench in U.S. and allied defense supply chains. By targeting heavy rare earths destined for ‚Äúdual-use‚Äù technologies ‚Äì serving either¬†civilian and/or defense¬†applications¬†‚Äì they¬†can¬†slow or kill such export licenses¬†and still claim to be following the law.***

This is happening at the very moment when the U.S. Department of Defense and allies such as Israel are in urgent need of restocking smart¬†bombs, missiles,¬†air defense systems,¬†and other¬†armaments. Each of the guided missiles we have seen arcing in the night sky recently rely on permanent magnets made with heavy rare earths. When inventories dwindle and these materials become unavailable, entire weapons supply chains grind to a halt.

[NioCorp's Critical Minerals Check all the Boxes! \~ \\""Not JUST Magnets! to make STUFF!\\""](https://preview.redd.it/0ik9pwh265lf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=da577e892e2cb99cebb54c1d9043ac93ce594f84)

The bottom line:¬†[China](https://dailycaller.com/2025/04/14/china-vietnam-sign-dozens-of-new-deals-strengthening-ties-as-trump-works-to-renegotiate-trade/)¬†is in a position to directly throttle U.S. military operations. Without a reliable supply of these elements, at some point, the¬†[Pentagon](https://dailycaller.com/2025/07/02/pentagon-demands-billions-for-missile-defense-as-trump-pushes-revolutionary-golden-dome/)¬†cannot replace what it fires.

This is not a hypothetical threat. China accounts for more than 99% of the global supply of separated dysprosium and terbium, both of which are essential for producing the high-temperature permanent magnets used in control surface actuators, seeker heads, radar arrays, and electric propulsion systems. These are not interchangeable materials. There are no proven, scalable substitutes¬†for these elements¬†that can meet performance requirements for defense platforms like the F-35, Aegis destroyers, or advanced missile systems.¬†

While some in Washington hope that commercial markets will fill the gap, the truth is they can‚Äôt. Few civilian magnet manufacturers operate under defense-rated specifications, and they depend on Chinese feedstock themselves. Even the most advanced rare earth companies in the West still ship some of their mined material to China for separation and processing. Beijing knows this. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre deliberately dividing the rare earth trade into ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù and ‚Äúmilitary‚Äù lanes ‚Äî and enforcing a chokehold on the latter.¬†

Washington must stop assuming that economic interdependence will serve as a guardrail against escalation aimed at U.S. defense supply chains. Clearly, China has no intention of allowing its economic leverage to go unused. Rare earths are no longer just a trade commodity ‚Äî they are a geopolitical weapon.

# What should the U.S. do?

***As President Trump understands all too well, we need a whole-of-government response to build a fully domestic supply chain for heavy rare earth elements and the magnets that rely on them. That means identifying, funding, and fast-tracking the small number of fully permitted projects that can begin mining and processing these materials on U.S. soil within the next several years.***

***The cold, hard truth is that there is only one greenfield project in the U.S. that is fully permitted for construction, is staffed by experienced rare earth separations personnel, and can get online to produce the heavy rare earths dysprosium and terbium in only 36 months from financing ‚Äì possibly faster. For purposes of full disclosure, I am the CEO of the company developing this project, known as the Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project in Nebraska.***

***But my point is that the U.S. needs at least a dozen such projects brought online in the U.S. as rapidly as possible. Only then can we establish a position of relative independence from China for these defense-critical materials.***

***More than any previous Commander in Chief, President Trump understands the strategic importance of rare earth elements. That is why he is taking aggressive steps in the right direction. The Pentagon is funding magnet manufacturing under Title III of the Defense Production Act. It is finalizing funding for new integrated mining and processing facilities, such as the Elk Creek Project. Congress appears poised to provide several billion dollars to encourage greater domestic critical minerals production and to enable the National Defense Stockpile to enter into forward purchase contracts for these critical materials.***

***A new Presidential Memorandum issued this week will implement a revolutionary concept: the development of a common application for federal funding opportunities for critical minerals projects, and the establishment of a single portal to allow applicants to apply to multiple funding programs. This will make federal funding more efficient. It should also allow faster and more strategic investment decisions to be made across the energy and mineral sectors.***

***The United States once led the world in rare earth production. We can do so again. But the clock is ticking. China‚Äôs message is now clear: It will not allow its strategic materials to flow to U.S. defense contractors without very tight conditions. As tensions over Taiwan,***¬†[***AI chips***](https://dailycaller.com/2025/04/14/nvidia-supercomputers-made-in-us/)***, and naval activity in the Pacific intensify, we should expect that leverage to be used again and again.***

# NioCorp's Elk Creek Mine is part of the Solution:

***\~The United States faces an urgent national security challenge: China‚Äôs near-total control over heavy rare earth elements ‚Äî particularly dysprosium and terbium ‚Äî is now being used as geopolitical leverage to throttle U.S. defense supply chains. These elements are essential for precision-guided weapons, fighter jets, and advanced radar systems, and there are no scalable substitutes. With China‚Äôs military reportedly influencing export controls, the flow of these materials for ‚Äúdual-use‚Äù (civilian and defense) technologies is being deliberately restricted, placing U.S. military readiness at risk. Despite stopgap measures, the situation exposes how deeply the West still depends on Chinese processing capacity, even when raw materials originate elsewhere.***

***In response, NioCorp CEO Mark Smith calls for a full-spectrum U.S. government mobilization to build an end-to-end domestic supply chain. He highlights that the Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project in Nebraska ‚Äî which he leads ‚Äî is the only fully permitted greenfield U.S. project capable of producing dysprosium and terbium within 36 months of financing. The project aligns with emerging federal initiatives, including new Title III Defense Production Act funding and a streamlined federal funding application portal. Smith argues that only a rapid, multi-project strategy ‚Äî like the one now taking shape under President Trump ‚Äî can restore U.S. mineral independence and secure the critical supply chains needed to support national defense and advanced manufacturing for years to come.\~***

# AUGUST 25th, 2025~Chinese Rare-Earth Stocks Surge After Beijing Tightens Controls

[Chinese Rare-Earth Stocks Surge After Beijing Tightens Controls | Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202508251069/chinese-rare-earth-stocks-surge-after-beijing-tightens-controls)

https://reddit.com/link/1mznmu3/video/c5bg8il315lf1/player

Chinese rare-earth stocks rose sharply after Chinese authorities published new rules to strengthen oversight of production and trading of the critical minerals.

Rare-earth stocks surged in Hong Kong and mainland China markets on Monday. JL Mag Rare-Earth closed 14% higher and Zijin Mining advanced 6.4% in Hong Kong. China Northern Rare Earth (Group) High-Tech ended 9.9% higher in Shanghai and ZheJiang ZhongKe Magnetic advanced 6.5% in Shenzhen.

The gains came after China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology published the latest regulations on Friday, setting output controls on rare-earth mining and smelting, and requiring companies to closely monitor and report product flows. The new rules took effect July 28.

China's dominant position in supplying rare-earth magnets and metals has been a powerful bargaining chip in trade negotiations with the U.S. After years of taking market share from the West, the country now produces about two-thirds of the world's rare-earth minerals, and processes around 90% of the supply.

Producers must record and submit monthly reports on the circulation of rare-earth products--critical for electric vehicles, jet fighters and wind turbines--to a government-run tracking system, according to the rules.

The rules specify that China's quota system applies not only to domestically produced materials but also imported materials for refining.

""China is implementing a wider range and higher level of monitoring on industry supply,"" Sinolink Securities analysts said in a research note, comparing the latest rules with the measures that were issued for public comment in February.

With the MIIT and the Ministry of Natural Resources deciding which entities are eligible for rare-earth production, the rules signal China's determination to strengthen its control over rare-earth supply, Sinolink added.

**IMHO ‚Äî NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek Project is now at the center of a powerful, multi-layered convergence:**

The Elk Creek Project is advancing through a rare alignment of project execution, supportive policy, and increasing capital market readiness. With Phase 1 drilling now complete, an updated resource estimate on the horizon, and the recent strategic hiring of Ernest Cleave to lead business development and financing, NioCorp is entering its most pivotal phase yet.

Strong U.S. government backing ‚Äî including a $10M DoD Title III grant, EXIM Bank engagement, and clear alignment with national defense stockpile priorities ‚Äî places Elk Creek among the most strategically significant critical minerals projects in the country. Broader macro trends like reshoring, supply chain security, and tariff realignment provide additional tailwinds heading into the anticipated Q4 2025 Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS).

Currently, the ""quiet period"" between drill completion and official results has created a catalyst vacuum ‚Äî a window that may be exploited by informed market participants to accumulate shares at suppressed levels. This is often the case in high-conviction, low-float plays just before key inflection points.

While a formal anchor investor has yet to be announced, signs point to strategic partners potentially waiting for the DFS to de-risk the economics. Given the project's national relevance and high-grade, multi-metal resource profile, it‚Äôs reasonable to expect entities like the DoD, Stellantis, Boeing, or other OEMs to engage ‚Äî potentially validating NioCorp‚Äôs valuation and unlocking broader capital access.

**With global supply/demand pressures mounting for Scandium, Niobium, Titanium, and REEs ‚Äî and Elk Creek uniquely positioned to deliver all four ‚Äî the next 4‚Äì6 months could redefine the company‚Äôs market perception**. Add to this the recent $1B in DOE critical mineral funding, $2B from the CHIPS Act being targeted by the Trump administration, and the emergence of the DOD‚Äôs SMR/DPA Critical Minerals Hub

# ‚Äî and it‚Äôs clear: NioCorp isn‚Äôt just about magnets. It‚Äôs part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Solution!

# ‚Äî A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2028 and beyond.

# NioCorp = ""The¬†Flagship U.S. source¬†for multiple Critical Minerals!‚Äù

1mznmmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1mznmmz/mcp_cloud_a_platform_that_connects_ai_to_the_real/,MCP Cloud - a platform that connects AI to the real world. What do you think?,"Hi everyone!

I am looking for honest feedback, help, thoughts an ideas about our AI product.

[https://mcp-cloud.io/](https://mcp-cloud.io/)

# I know what you think: yet another AI startup... ü•±

***And what a heck is this MCP thing???***¬†üßê

*I totally get your scepticism - the AI space is¬†flooded¬†with buzzwords, and sometimes it feels like we're just adding more layers of complexity to problems that don‚Äôt even exist, right? Like,*¬†***do we really need our chatbot to order pizza?***

But let me try to break it down in a more personal, practical way‚Äîbecause you're right, today‚Äôs MCP servers are still in their infancy. They're a bit like the early App Store: lots of simple, fun, but not-yet-life-changing tools. But the¬†***potential***¬†is where the things will get truly exciting.

***Imagine this:***

You wake up. You grab coffee, you open your MCP-powered chatbot (let‚Äôs assume it‚Äôs hooked up to¬†**the remote MCP)**. Instead of jumping between 10+ tabs (Jira, Slack, Notion, your CRM, ERP, Google Calendar, GitHub, that internal wiki nobody can ever find‚Ä¶), you just type:

>*‚ÄúHey, can you summarize my top priorities for today? Pull my Jira tickets, check for pending PRs in GitHub, check Slack messages where I am tagged and suggest answers, etc.‚Äù*

In seconds, you get a clean, context-aware summary. No app switching. No digging. Just‚Ä¶ done.  
Then later:

>‚ÄúCan you draft a response to the client‚Äôs last email based on the proposal doc in Notion and also check our data warehouse for the Q3 metrics they asked about?‚Äù

**Boom. Done.**¬†You only need to review, make correction and approve. You won't even need to open Jira, Slack, Github, Salesforce to make an action - everything is done by AI agent (your LLM Client App) with the help of connected MCP servers.

>‚ÄúCreate a subtask in Jira for the API bug Juan mentioned in yesterday‚Äôs standup‚Äîand notify the team in Slack.‚Äù

You didn‚Äôt touch a single app. You didn‚Äôt even leave your chat....

***And even something completely crazy: you do all of these by just speaking to an AI assistant why riding a bicycle to your office.***

# How is it possible at all? üßê

**Meet MCP!**

MCP stands for¬†**Model Context Protocol**¬†‚Äî a new standard that lets AI models like ChatGPT connect to¬†**external tools, APIs, and data sources**¬†in real time.

**MCP**¬†is Like¬†**USB-C for ChatGPT**. One common plug to safely connects ChatGPT to¬†*any tool or data, any website, cloud application, service*.... anything! Need to order pizza? Schedule a ride home? Send email, pay for grocery, rent a car, buy a flight ticket, submit tax declaration, send flowers with a gift card to your sweethart - all done by chatting with ChatGPT!

# Have you heard that ChatGPT already supports Remote MCP connections?!

You probably haven't noticed it yet, because it is only supported for¬†**Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu plan**¬†only. It‚Äôs not yet for everyone, but the signs are clear: this is coming to all users soon, and it will be a¬†**game changer**.

# But what is the business opportunity here? ü§î

>***To use all of these services from any device (including your IPhone) you need to connect it to an MCP Server***

**And here is a CATCH:**

Here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ MCP isn‚Äôt just something you¬†*download*.  
You actually have to¬†**run**¬†it somewhere (in a server in your basement or in cloud).

*And unless you have:*

* *A PhD in Computer Science*
* *10+ years of software development under your belt*
* *Or a license in certified¬†black magic programming*

‚Ä¶**you probably won‚Äôt get it working without a few tears, a gallon of coffee, and maybe a minor existential crisis.**

# Enter: MCP Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è‚ú®

  
We are building¬†[MCP Cloud](https://mcp-cloud.io/)¬†is here to save the day!

**MCP Cloud is a new Platform that will help you to:**

* Run MCP tools without setting up scary servers
* Share them with other people instantly
* Even make a little money if you want to offer your tool to others

*When Remote MCP becomes available to all ChatGPT users, you won‚Äôt need to know how it works under the hood ‚Äî you‚Äôll just click ‚Äúconnect‚Äù and boom: ChatGPT can use your favorite tool, fetch your data, or automate your work.*

**Why will every person need Remote MCP?**

It is dead obvious: today you use your LLM Client on MacBook Pro. But tomorrow you will use LLM Client (with voice) on your IPhone.

**Why will every company needs Remote MCP?**

It is dead obvious too! Managing infrastructure of your own MCPs with OAuth, personal access tokens for multiple users to manage access to the same MCP servers, setting up SSO, security, https, containerization, isolation, IP witelisting .... and doing it FAST - is a hassle. And the lost time efficient business cannot allow itself to loose. Better to use 3rd party service.

# Where do we stand now

We are a small team working relentlessly on the¬†[MCP Cloud](https://mcp-cloud.io/). Our¬†**Beta release**¬†has happened only a few days ago,¬†***but we already serve our first users!!!***

We are actively testing and improving our yet small platform.

***Happy to hear any feedbak, thoughts, ideas. Let's start a discussion. I‚Äôm especially keen on feedback from founders/ops/PMs who‚Äôve tried to roll AI beyond a single champion. Thanks!***

I recently encountered na hindi binigay ng driver yung order ko kahit bayad na. And nag report na din ako sa Grab about it pero wala pa din refund.

So, the scenario was nag order kami ng coffee paid na and worth 1.2k, kaso 5mins before dumating grab, I had to do something really important, so sinabihan ko kasama ko na kunin niya na, and may mga guards din naman sa labas ng building which usually sakanila iniiwan yung mga orders na di kaagad nakukuha. Grab driver called, nandiyan na daw siya, I answered na ‚ÄúOkay po, kunin na lang po ng kasama ko‚Äù since I had to do something at dahil din dun di ko na nasagot mga tawag ni driver. Which is wrong on my part, kaso di ko talaga masagot yung call dahil sa ganap ko that time.

Lumabas kasama ko, di niya daw nakita grab, tinanong din nila mga guard, wala man daw dumating. (correct yung pin since lagi talaga kami nag o-order) And then I had the chance to talk through chat, asking kung ano gagawin sa order, ibibigay ba niya? And I also mentioned na di siya nakita ng kasama ko and ng guards.

He answered, ‚ÄúSinungaling guard niyo‚Äù dito nag start gigil ko haha and ‚ÄúCheck niyo man po CCTV, makikita niyo po food panda‚Äù and then I mentioned, ‚ÄúAh diba po grab kayo?‚Äù And then biglang sabi niya ‚Äú15minutes rule po if hindi nakuha ni Customer alis na po kami‚Äù and then I asked again, ‚ÄúSo paano po yung mga coffee‚Äù and yung reply niya, ‚ÄúNa-report ko na sa grab‚Äù LIKE?! Haha.

Anyway, concern ako kay kuya at first talaga na I even thought of giving 100 as tip since ‚Äúhindi nakuha‚Äù but I was also thinking na baka kaya di siya nakita kasi naka ‚Äúfood panda‚Äù siya?

Anyway, dahil di na niya ako nireplyan about sa kung ibibigay pa niya yung orders, nainis ako, and I told him na irereport ko na lang din yung transaction and will mention na naka FoodPanda siya, and I did I sent the screenshot of our chats sa CS ni Grab. Pero wala pa din refund until now since reason nila ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt able to get the food after 15mins‚Äù

Nakonsensya ako now kasi what if natanggalan pa ng work si kuya sa Grab dahil sa small mistake na to? Since nalaman ni Grab na FoodPanda rider din siya.

What are your thoughts about this?

And for the driver, I am so sorry for reporting üôèüèº",1,1756120402.0,GigilAko,1,1.0,False
1mznm8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscifistories/comments/1mznm8t/the_sweetness_of_change_and_the_fear_of_snakes/,The sweetness of change and the fear of snakes,"I remember when the world changed. We were once a species arguing because we were a shade darker or lighter than each other. We hated each other for being born a certain way. For trying to look different from our labels. For loving or not loving. That seems so stupid now.  



That changed after the event. An anomaly that we still don‚Äôt understand. I woke up that day, dreading going to work. I stayed in bed for a few more minutes than usual. I didn‚Äôt want to get up. I didn‚Äôt want to feel my back ache trying to stand. I didn‚Äôt want to skip breakfast and lunch just so I could afford to go to the doctor. I didn‚Äôt want to listen to Susan talk about how the‚Ä¶. What was it that she always complained about, some group causing all her problems. Man, they must have really hated her.  



I got up from bed and made my favourite brand of cheap coffee. It would be my only meal until dinner. I took the glorious first sip. I hoped to forget the bitterness. Mom threw all my sugar away, telling me to look after my weight. An unexpected feeling filled my mouth. It was a pleasant feeling, but it was slightly different from the sweetness, like feeling a completely different flavour, yet having the comfort and familiarity of eating a chocolate cake.  




That feeling woke me up from my drowsiness. Everything was different. Everything felt different. My usual white mug was now white with a hint of hotred. A shade, apparently in the infrared. I called it that because it was the colour of hot things and it feels adjacent to red, but not quite red. I can guess how hot something is by the shade of it.  



Then I noticed another pair of arms dangling underneath my arms. Something I definitely didn‚Äôt have before. I ran to the mirror to examine myself and saw a humanoid I have never seen before. My body was a glowing shade of cyan, with spots of royal blue. My face looked human, except for a dark tear-shaped stripe running sideways on my cheeks. I had four arms, that felt like I had had them my whole life. But I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúknow‚Äù how to move them. I was about the same size I was, maybe a bit healthier. I ran to my phone to open Reddit, to search for what was happening.  




There were thousands of posts about how people had changed. Some had shrunk to the size of mice. Some grew to the size of houses.  




Some who were awake saw a massive UFO, sending beams of light throughout the world. Then they witnessed their bodies change in real time. No pain nor panic. It was as if their bodies were always meant to be that. Some didn‚Äôt change at all.  




One person woke up scared of their tail, which also happened to be a snake.  




I looked at the multiple thick snake-like appendages hanging from my hair.  


‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt be snakes,‚Äù I remember praying to the aliens. Oh, how naive I was.

1mznibp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1mznibp/advice_please/,Advice please,"Alright boys I've lost my mind. 31 years old, this is my 3rd companie I've worked for. I'm not trying to come off as a little bitch here, genuinely looking for advice

First place of employment was in 2020, mostly high end residential, went smooth for almost 3 years, my jouynman was fucking awesome, he taught me quite a  bit and kept me safe. He ""retired"" after working for the company for 28 years because he wanted 5 weeks of paid vacation instead of 4. I found out later he was only making 29 dollars an hour with his E-2. 

He left and I stood around, got a new j man after constantly being sent out on my own. New j man was also pretty cool, about my age but we got a long well and completed a lot of jobs in a safe and timely fashion, boss started kinda being a dickhead and started sending me out to do jobs I'm not qualified for, but alright. One day I show up, j man has an emergency right away and leaves, I call our boss and get no response for 45 minutes. At this point I just left and went back home, didn't want pay just expecting the day off. He called me and lost his temper, I showed up the next day, took my toolls, kindly told him to fuck off and left. (This job paid OT under the table and provided no health insurance) 

Got bitched out by my family for quitting. 

Went to the state . Gov website and found a bunch of places registered for apprentship programs in my area and just sent a ton of emails. Got a job in like 3 days after, they have insurance and I took a small pay cut. 

Get placed on a generator install crew(nice I'm generac certified anyway). The crew I'm in consists of me, and two 22 year olds, and a 17 year old still in trade school. For the most part it was good, they were immature but we stayed safe, I constantly pulled and tied into live meters, with no problem. Untill one day pulling the meter we snapped a fiberglass casing and the lug hit the outside of the meter can. It scared the shit out of me and I'm not sure if I should even be alive, they swapped the whole meter live (what the fuck)? I was told this was normal but it grossly was not. They never contacted call before you dig and one morning I just decided I like being alive, so I put my two weeks in. They literally would not let me quit. At the point I'm having a mental breakdown, so after two weeks I just texted them and said I'm resigning for my own mental health. 

3rd company was much better than the other two, better pay, much less work than I'm used to. Working with experienced guys that teach me but still no health insurance, was told it would be 1,200 a month for their policy which I just can't afford and makes no sense. I have no PCP, no existing conditions, no prescriptions and all I do is see a therapist every two weeks(120 out of pocket). But alright let's just finish the liscnese with the state under them. 

A guy that worked for the companies and has major issues came back after a year of ""losing his mind"" he tells me his girl left him and he lost it so he just disappeared, I get that but in the back of my head I know theirs major red flags and issues with him. So I'm now in this position of having to work with a total scumbag, he basically owns no tools, uses mine and breaks them or they just ""disappear"" spills coffee all over himself because he's nodding off and drops the whole thing on his lap, he's not allowed to drive because he's been in a hit and run. And then this mother fucker takes credit for everything I do, and blames me for any and everything. He used my wera screwdriver to tro prying something and then bent it, threw it at the wall and said ""stop buying pussy tools"". I usually will speak up, but this guy is unhinged and literally I feel like he will strangle me. Our boss knows his issues and still employes him, our other journman don't want him on their jobs so I get stuck with him and I'm convinced I'm just a glorified baby sitter. The other day I'm trying to swap out outlets (6/7) and the panel is right behind me, so I plug in my testers and just go one by one. Found the circuit and shut it off, went downstairs for 10 seconds to grab the new outlets. On my way up the stairs, all I can think is, it's the only breaker off.... I bet he turned it back on after I literally told him. I have one off please leave it. I tested again and sure as shit he turned it back on... 

What in the fuck do I do now? Quit again go for a 4th companie to finish this license?

1mzngs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mzngs7/neighbours_wont_leave_me_alone_over_my_cat_going/,Neighbours won't leave me alone over my cat going outside,"Hey guys, never really made this kind of post before. Please don't kill me for any formatting mistakes or the sort :)

I'm so frustrated. So I (22f) have 3 cats, only one goes outside. Because he got lost a few years ago (he couldn't find his way home) I have purchased a good tracker he wears so I can see what he's up to and when he wants to come home. I usually put it on, let him out the door and watch him go off on his little adventures. Then when I see on my phone he's on his way back, I'll go outside and see him in. I have the time to do all of this because I work from home, I have the phone next to my monitor and since I'm on the ground floor, it takes less than 30 seconds. Before this, he was going out on a leash to be supervised. The neighbours had a problem with this too.

Back story! I moved into this flat a little over a year ago. I originally moved in with my now ex, there was no problems at all during this period. Who could've thunk it? We broke up and he moved out. Since then I've been living with my flatmate, lets call him Andy. Andy (20m) is a quiet guy, doesn't party, just keeps to himself and goes to work. He also adores my kitties, he loves to take the outdoor cat on walks. Now, since Andy found a job in a nearby town, he leaves early for work. We made a deal that he will help me with car payments and give me fuel money if I drive him. Since I work from home, no problem, and cheaper bills! He's been working there for quite a while now, and the neighbours HATE it. They, who look over 60 I'm not sure, came over to my door one day and started banging it down. I didn't open as I didn't know who it was and I was in the middle of an online lecture (university at the time). Since I didn't answer, they took it upon themselves to start slamming my letter box (which is quite heavy) so hard I thought someone was breaking in. I leave my lecture, open the door, explain why I didn't answer and neighbour starts telling me off about my door. I'm a little confused and ask what exactly, she claims we ""slam"" our door in the morning. I close the door in front of her and ask if this is the noise or something else. She claims that's the noise and it ""echoes"" through her house. What she is complaining about is a brand new Yale lock I paid for myself. She lives on the first floor on the opposite side of me. No other neighbour has complained about it and they also have Yale locks. I apologised, thinking she is on retirement so maybe she's more sensitive, and said I will close the door quieter when I leave to drive Andy. That wasn't good enough, she told me to fix the lock or remove it all together. I say, um no its brand new, but I will call my landlord over it. I did, he came over, was shocked she's complaining since it's one standard click. Since then I've been closing the door so gently the Yale lock doesn't close on the first try, and I have to gently tap the door until it clicks. 

So, that's how the hatred started. Since then she's been calling the council every single day to complain about the lock being too loud. My landlord is sick of the phone calls as the council must call him about it per policy. I should also clarify for the next bit, I rent privately, she rents a council house, and we are in the UK. 

Now, the kitty incident(s). As kitty was on a leash originally, he would go where he wanted and we followed. The neighbours have a small tiny fence around a triangular section of the garden, maybe a meter in length, that they go downstairs to maintain. There is also a ground floor neighbour who allegedly upkeeps it but I've never seen him go to the garden (he's a nice guy no complaints). The ground floor neighbour also never came to complain at any point of me living here. My cat goes on the grass outside the ground neighbours flat, which is public grass owned by the council. Everytime he would look (yes look) at their garden, they would open the first story window and yell at us to keep him away from their flowers. We said yes, he's on a leash, we're making sure he doesn't go in the flowers. At most our kitty just likes to sit on the edge, on the grass, and sniff the air, then walk off to do his adventuring. He's been on the leash plenty, and every time they yell at us, no matter time of day. More recently, he was on ""their"" side of the building, on the public grass and neighbour started yelling again, but this time his wife walked downstairs to beckon Andy like a child. Think a mother curling her finger at her child after he fucked up. Andy, who had the cat in his arms to take him to the other side of the building, came up to her to say hi and be nice. But she exploded on him. ""keep the cat off MY side of the building, I live here, you can't walk under peoples' windows it's creepy, keep him off MY grass, I don't understand why he can't go the other direction"" etc. She said more things but these are the main points she brought up. To answer her, Andy said he's a cat, he will not pee in their flowers as he has a litter box at home (we also never seen him do his business outside), the grass isn't theirs, and they don't even live on the ground floor so what's their point. He also pointed out that WE do live on the ground floor, and there is dog walkers all the time, and we never had an issue with someone walking their dog next to our window. She was still yapping if you will, about how he shouldn't be on ""their"" side of the building at all! at this point Andy lost his patience and told her to get a life, she said it back to him, to which Andy turned to kitty and said ""neighbour is being a c\*nt lets go"". To this she stormed upstairs fuming. Now I know that wasn't the nicest, but it's a common thing to say here and we are well fed up with getting yelled at.

Most recent! I got a tracker for kitty, as mentioned at the start. He's been loving it! he goes on his own terms, runs up to us purring when we see him outside, walks to the nearby corner store with us. I'm so happy with it. He gets let out maybe once or twice a day? He's only had it about 3-4 days. Earlier today I made my morning coffee and sat with kitty on steps, once he was off to do his thing I went back in. A few hours later I saw on the app that he was going in a line straight home, so I paused programming and went out to greet him. Well, the guy neighbour was there, staring him down, standing infront of his plants like gandalf. Kitty wanted past his garden (still on the grass btw) to walk to my door. I go near them, say hello and call over kitty. To this kitty runs along the fence (not in the plantssss) and gets on the steps ready to go home. Neighbour is fuming, comes up to me and tells me, once again, keep him away from their flowers. I say he literally has a tracker, I actively see where he goes and I have a virtual fence alert set up on that garden bit to be notified when he goes there. He doesn't believe me. I say that's why I came out just now, he was passing your garden to go home. He proceeded to say some things about me sitting on my ass all day and doing nothing, so I must have nothing better to do than to send my cat on a mission to piss on their flowers I guess. Now the creepy fact, he said this because his wife admitted to me a bit back that she watches my car and when I leave my flat. Since I don't leave often, I must be unemployed on benefits being a junkie bla bla bla. So now he's very rude to me, and pointed out I was in my pajamas when fetching kitty. Mind you it was 10am, I had a coffee in hand and was just getting started with web dev. He started yelling out to his wife to come over to my door as ""the cat was there again"". At this point kitty was already inside so I just closed the door.

So now, I'm inside, and complained to the council because I honestly feel harassed at this point. Everytime me or Andy leave the house and one of them is outside, they will bother us. Cat does cat things outside? they yell out their window or walk out their flat to bother us. We close the door at 6am? they call the council. And ontop of this they watch my car and door to see when I leave my own house! I feel insane complaining to the council over neighbours yelling about my cat, but this is ridiculous. Maybe I'm being insane here and they are right. I'd like an outside perspective if I should keep complaining to the council since they're in council housing, or leave it and simply keep supervising kitty. Please note this has been going on for months and I have tried to find a middle ground with them but they're always unhappy. So reddit, AITA? ",4,1756119908.0,AITAH,22,0.7,False

The EU is progressing with its digital stablecoin initiative while CSX announces an international deal with BNSF. Upcoming earnings Monday from PDD and SMTC will be closely watched along with FOMC data, New Home Sales, and Fed speakers Logan and Williams.

The market is navigating key [SPY](https://flic.kr/p/2rp2D1h) levels of 646 and 636 with mixed sector performance and significant news flow including Barclays upgrading Altria's price target, Blackrock filing for a coffee IPO, and positive compliance news from CYCU on NASDAQ. The EU is progressing with its digital stablecoin initiative while CSX announces an international deal with BNSF.The President announced an investigation into furniture tariffs.  Upcoming earnings from PDD and SMTC will be closely watched along with FOMC data, New Home Sales, and Fed speakers Logan and Williams. Volatility remains elevated with VIX and VVIX showing uncertainty, while defensive sectors like XLP underperform. Analyst sentiment reflects cautious optimism with a balanced view on market direction.
SPY support is at 636 with resistance at 646. Technical analysis shows a Money Flow Index above 50, indicating positive inflows, a Directional Movement Index with the +DI higher than the -DI, and a strong ADX, confirming upward trend strength. Price remains above the Displaced Moving Average, signaling sustained bullish momentum if maintained.

Regarding major earnings reports, PDD Holdings is expected to report earnings with mixed expectations focusing on international e-commerce growth, potentially causing volatility in the consumer discretionary sector premarket. Semtech Corporation will also report, with the semiconductor industry‚Äôs strength as a key focus and possible premarket impact on tech sector sentiment. Both reports may influence broader sector rotation, especially in e-commerce and semiconductors. 

Traders are closely watching upcoming FOMC statements, New Home Sales data, and Fed speakers Logan and Williams for insights on inflation and the economy. Interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as financials and real estate could see moderate reactions depending on Fed commentary. 

Inflation data remains moderate, supporting a cautious inflation outlook that encourages selective risk-taking in consumer staples and discretionary sectors. Trading strategies should focus on dip buys in sectors affected by inflation fears but showing fundamental strength. The EU advancing a digital stablecoin project signals regulatory acceptance of digital currencies, potentially benefiting fintech and blockchain sectors globally. Additionally, CSX announced a new international services deal with BNSF, strengthening the logistics sector.

So, the scenario was nag order kami ng coffee paid na and worth 1.2k, kaso 5mins before dumating grab, I had to do something really important, so sinabihan ko kasama ko na kunin niya na, and may mga guards din naman sa labas ng building which usually sakanila iniiwan yung mga orders na di kaagad nakukuha. Grab driver called, nandiyan na daw siya, I answered na ‚ÄúOkay po, kunin na lang po ng kasama ko‚Äù since I had to do something at dahil din dun di ko na nasagot mga tawag ni driver. Which is wrong on my part, kaso di ko talaga masagot yung call dahil sa ganap ko that time.

Lumabas kasama ko, di niya daw nakita grab, tinanong din nila mga guard, wala man daw dumating. (correct yung pin since lagi talaga kami nag o-order) And then I had the chance to talk through chat, asking kung ano gagawin sa order, ibibigay ba niya? And I also mentioned na di siya nakita ng kasama ko and ng guards. 

He answered, ‚ÄúSinungaling guard niyo‚Äù and ‚ÄúCheck niyo man po CCTV, makikita niyo po food panda‚Äù and then I mentioned, ‚ÄúAh diba po grab kayo?‚Äù And then biglang sabi niya ‚Äú15minutes rule po if hindi nakuha ni Customer alis na po kami‚Äù and then I asked again, ‚ÄúSo paano po yung mga coffee‚Äù and yung reply niya, ‚ÄúNa-report ko na sa grab‚Äù LIKE?! Haha. 

Anyway, concern ako kay kuya at first talaga na I even thought of giving 100 as tip since ‚Äúhindi nakuha‚Äù but I was also thinking na baka kaya di siya nakita kasi naka ‚Äúfood panda‚Äù siya? 

Anyway, dahil di na niya ako nireplyan about sa kung ibibigay pa niya yung orders, nainis ako, and I told him na irereport ko na lang din yung transaction and will mention na naka FoodPanda siya, and I did I sent the screenshot of our chats sa CS ni Grab. Pero wala pa din refund until now since reason nila ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt able to get the food after 15mins‚Äù 

Nakonsensya ako now kasi what if natanggalan pa ng work si kuya sa Grab dahil sa small mistake na to? Since nalaman ni Grab na FoodPanda rider din siya. 

What are your thoughts about this?

1mznec1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1mznec1/just_got_married_but_thinking_of_divorce/,Just got married but thinking of divorce,"I'm in a difficult situation right now. My husband (28M) and I (27F) got married two months ago. He pursued me very persistently ‚Äî saw me once, then immediately went to my parents and asked for my hand. Before the wedding, we had several conversations about financial responsibilities and the roles of husband and wife. He presented himself as the ideal partner, insisting he would take full financial responsibility, even saying he'd give me pocket money.

We both work and earn roughly the same salary. I live and work in a city that's about two hours away from him. My parents and I discussed this with him before the marriage, and he said he had no issue with the distance, especially since I‚Äôm trying to build experience in my field. I even offered to stay with my parents during the week and visit him on weekends, but he was adamant that we get a private place for the two of us in my city.

Once we moved into the apartment, things changed drastically. He suddenly said he wouldn‚Äôt contribute to the rent because we‚Äôre living here because of my job. He also expects me to cover the cost of eating out, even small things like coffee. When I push back, he accuses me of being stingy and says I should be spending my money on him.

Meanwhile, he‚Äôs paying rent for a room with a friend in the other city and refuses to take any financial responsibility for our shared apartment. On top of that, he expects me to cook, clean, and obey him completely. He says if we lived together in his city, he‚Äôd pay for everything ‚Äî but still wants me to ‚Äúhelp out,‚Äù arguing that he‚Äôs ‚Äúallowing‚Äù me to work and deserves something in return.

We had previously agreed not to have children in the first year, but when he gets angry, he suddenly demands that we start trying for kids now.

I agreed to pay the rent for the first year, even though I could‚Äôve just lived at home and avoided all this expense. I‚Äôm starting to feel deeply resentful and regret that decision. I feel like I‚Äôm being used ‚Äî not just financially, but emotionally too. I don‚Äôt even feel loved.

I was thinking of waiting until January to see if he follows through on his promise to request a transfer to my city and take on more responsibility. But I don‚Äôt know what to do if he doesn‚Äôt move. I feel stuck and don't know what to think or do.

""The seeds of fate are sewn by the hands of every molecule in existence. One man's God is yet another's fallen angel.""

- Professor Phillip J. Covington, 1916, Miskatonic University

My father's favorite quote. He knew it better than he knew his own family.

Maybe it was those words that helped keep my soul afloat as everything crumbled around me. Perhaps, it will be my only company at the end. Either way, I believe I understand its meaning a bit more clearly after that harrowing night.

A wiry tenor voice crackled over the phone as Oliver spoke the morning of our meeting.

""Sparrow's Diner. Find me in the back. I'll pick a booth. Come alone.""

The tension in his voice reassured me of just how serious he was about all of this. I knew I could trust him... At least as far as this case goes.

The outside of Sparrow's came as a nice change from the surrounding architecture. It was antiquated, at best. What it lacked in modern amenities, it made up for with a rare and authentic urban charm.

I found Oliver at the little mom-and-pop diner, not too far from Bleakmire Parish. He was already sitting in one of the greasy booths, tucked away in a corner, far from the few patrons that were murmuring to each other throughout the establishment.

Cheap, knock off 50's decor lined the walls. Every table had one of those tacky stained-glass light fixtures that hung by a thick wire, hovering just a little too low, dangling haphazardly above the silverware.

The hanging light droned on through out our awkward encounter, taking short breaks from buzzing when the electricity occasionally flickered out. The smell of a fryer bubbling in the back of the restaurant mingled with the powerful scent of stale black Colombian coffee.

Oliver tried his best to look inconspicuous under his short, ragged salt and pepper hair, drenched in perspiration. A glint of poorly sealed madness shone at the corner of his eye.

He was closer to my age than my father's, though it was hard to tell with his features completely worn down by stress. Even if his cheap black suit needed a good washing and proper ironing, I couldn't judge a man offering a helping hand.

Holding his head low, he saw me and mustered the bravado to give me a weak smile and a jittery wave.

I sat across the table from him. His facade faded in an instant.

The man practically vibrated with nervous energy. His hand visibly shook as he reached for his fifth cup of coffee.

I almost broke the tense silence several times as we stared at each other with an unspoken understanding of just how peculiar this situation was.

Oliver wordlessly smacked an open palm on the table top.

He quickly snapped his hand back to his side as if whatever he set on the table was about to explode at any second.

Instead of a bomb, Oliver's hand revealed a simple silver ring, now lying on the table. Empty coffee mugs clanked into each other as his elbow retracted with a swift, shakey motion.

Bouncing legs rattled the cups and saucers to the point where I could feel the whole table trying to wriggle free from under my arms.

Lanky fingers curled into a fist. He chewed on thin nails. I spoke out loud what we both knew was true.

""This was Kenneth's.""

I wish I could have mustered more sympathy for my father in that moment.

Oliver nodded quickly.

""Yes. It was the only thing I could take with me. It slipped off of his finger when... while I tried to save him. I wasn't fast enough.""

Oliver's voice felt sincere, but his thousand yard stare gave him the appearance of a pale wraith, come to enact a punishment for some unknown transgression. His eyes did not see me. They stared right through me.

He pushed the ring forward.

Bile splashed onto my tongue and I fought back the urge to vomit as a wave of emotions struck me with mental projections of my father's blood smeared corpse.

I could smell bacon frying in the back room, its nauseating sizzle haunting me as I looked down at the simple wedding band. It hurt deeply to see he still wore the matching half to Mom's ring up until his dying breath.

I nodded, tenderly picking up the ring and enduring a pain that had been broiling up in my chest since I first walked into my newly inherited office.

The trinket was chilling in my palm.

I felt the shifted weight of responsibility from father to son for the first time in my life. I knew now that whatever Kenneth was doing here was worth dying for. At least, it was to him. Even if it was all in his head.

Oliver's gaunt facial features practically tightened to fit his bones as he handpicked his next words carefully. His eyes kept flicking sideways to peek out the window. His nervous fingers tapped out an erratic tune as he continued to try and calm his nerves.

""I would imagine you're looking for answers, Mister Rooke... And it would practically eat away at my soul if I didn't attempt to stop you‚Äî""

""Don't even try.""

My own voice sounded foreign to me in that dimly lit diner.

Oliver shifted uncomfortably in his cushioned booth bench. I sat back in mine, feeling the cool hard tabletop against the bottom of my folded hands. Its smooth surface helped ground my nerves, even if only for a moment.

A young waitress came by and took my order for a coffee. Her curly red hair and bored eyes bobbed as she scribbled on her writing pad. Oliver waited until she was around the corner.

""Ok, Lawrence. Fine. I won't argue. All I will say is that you are willingly falling into the same trap as your father.""

I leaned forward without realizing it.

""What the fuck do you mean by that?""

With a sigh of resignation and a voice full of unease, he recalled the night my father died.

""I went with Kenneth‚Äîexcuse me, I went with your father that night to visit an old acquaintance of his at Saint Jacob's Church. We were ambushed.""

Oliver sipped on his cup of coffee, though it was clear that more energy was the last thing he needed right now. The man looked like he might jump out of his seat and flee at any moment. Instead, he held the table and continued:

""One of their leaders, Reverend Armond. He was our man on the inside, but his help was a ruse. He trapped us with something truly monstrous. Down in the tunnels.""

Recalling that night was causing physical pain to Oliver as he writhed in his chair. He moved with all the grace of a wounded wolf, caught in the iron grip of a hunter's trap.

With an exasperated sigh, Oliver hissed a whisper that I barely caught over the humming of our gaudy table lighting. Smelling his rancid breath only somewhat diluted my understanding of his words.

""The Sin Eaters,"" his hands fidgeted with some silverware still wrapped in a napkin, ""those bastards are always watching, don't you get it?!""

My mind took me back to that dreaded office, to those mad scrawlings in my father's case files. I began to suspect Oliver was just as far off his rocker as my old man.

Oliver finished his cup of coffee and physically yearned for the waitress to come back. He clinked the cup back on its saucer and put both hands on the table to lean in closer.

His timid demeanor collapsed under a newly found aggression that poured forth as he forced himself to speak quickly and quietly.

""You want to find the Sin Eaters? Fine. You'll be doing it alone. I am never setting foot in that god forsaken place again... Did you bring his damned map?""

I was a bit taken aback that he knew anything about my father's possessions. I pulled the folded paper from my coat pocket and slid it over the table, slipping it past the coffee cups and saucers.

With a jolt, he pulled the map in, scribbling furiously at it. He was out of his seat by the time I realized he had pushed the map back over to me, a neurotic outburst barely contained in his movements.

I didn't bother trying to get him to come back for more questions. The man's sanity was spent, devoured by whatever happened that fateful night. Instead, I looked at what my new acquaintance had written on my map.

""Rise again, K'thali Mata'rith. The question is Saint Jacob's.""

Below, he scratched in a message that I read and reread until it clicked:

""Search Bleakmire for the Dark Angel. That is where the devourers hide.""

I cursed under my breath. I had no idea what the hell any of that meant. I stumbled my way out of the booth, my shoulder accidentally bumping the light fixture on the way up.

""Hey‚Äî"" I tried to shout as Oliver passed through the door.

I slammed money for the coffee and a tip on the table without counting out the bills and made a mindless dash for the door. I prayed that I might still catch him in the heartless streets of Arkham before I was cast into this insane situation on my own.

With a newfound sense of urgency, I ripped the diner door open and stepped out into the inky black street. Steel light poles lined either side of the road, doing their best to fight against the shroud of night.

I caught a fleeting glimpse of Oliver as he took the first of what I suspect would have been many evasive turns around the corner of the diner, into a blackened alley.

As I took my first step on the grimey and trash covered brick alley, I heard it.

A gutteral scream ripped across the night sky.

Pain and primal terror violently expelled from the lungs of my only ally thus far in this haunting task that lies ahead.

My mind scrambled into a kaleidoscope of twisting pressure that threatened to implode my skull in the wake of a drowning flood of volatile emotions.

Shock overlapped anxiety and was completely smothered by a sense of intimidating awe that scraped the back of my thoughts with the raking claws of the unknown.

The hairs on my neck became sharp as needles in the electric aftermath of the sudden realization that my father wasn't so crazy, after all.

I froze in place. Oliver's scream dragged out into the muggy night air for several seconds, only to be cut short by the sound of something pulpy and wet being torn apart. The smell of decay and a coppery metallic tinge assailed my nostrils.

Unnatural gurgling sounds squelched from just around the corner of the diner. A strange, almost invisible gas filled the air, leaving my tongue dry.

""Oliver?"" I hoped he would answer before I could act.

Confusing sensations sent my imagination into orbit. I tried to calculate what living being on Earth could make a noise like that. I listened hard to the hellish sound that crept in between my thumping heartbeats.

A howling tailwind carried my body to the edge of the alleyway with a speed fueled mostly by fear and caffeine.

I stopped at the edge of the void that veiled the path. The faltering remnants of street lamp light trickled along the damp brick and was repelled by a physical darkness that filled the space with an amoeba-like fluidity.

My eyesight plunged into a wall of shadow that wrapped the scene with a filter that still casts doubt on my memories of that night, even now.

Just at the edge of the light, a mound of what appeared to be dried leather was rustling and shaking as it was being dragged further into the unseeable darkness.

I was a bit distracted by an overpoweringly sickly sweet smell that practically halted the breeze itself. The lump kept shaking just beyond my sight...

Like a fly larvae, the lump pulsated with an organic fluid-sac quality that made my skin crawl. As it slithered further into the dark, I strained my eyes into a squint, unable to propel my legs forward another step.

In the abyss of that bleak alley, I could barely see round, wet, reflective orbs glistening just behind the lump. The discarded leather crackled like old paint under a hot sun as it shrank lower and smaller against the brick alleyway.

The taste of black coffee soured on my tongue as the silhouette of an animalistic mass appeared beneath the strange reflective orbs.

An undulating slender form pulsed with an insatiably wretched hunger that matched the inhuman movements in the leather pile. Its body was the size of a large jungle cat or a bear, and yet its shape did not resemble either in the least.

In the dark, I could almost see a long, thin tail as it scraped below a rusted dumpster. A body, like a fat snake wrapped in rotted human flesh, with four gangly limbs protruding out and holding itself up. Hands extended into long fingers that pressed tightly to the rough brick walls.

A woman's head sat atop the being's elongated neck, mostly shrouded by stringy black hair. A sinewy, ropey red appendage branched outwards from within the hair, hanging suspended in mid air. It forked and split off, occasionally rippling like a sentient cluster of fleshy lightning.

Those horrific arteries continued to grow outwards. It released a disgusting pressurized hiss until, with an unflattering pop, a vaporous mist was dissolved from the air around the pile of flakey leather.

The smell of burning flesh and hair made my stomach do somersaults as I tried to peer into shadows that thankfully hid that avatar of blasphemy's full image from my eyes.

My vision adjusted even more. A cheap black suit was shredded to pieces and discarded in tatters along the cold dried and crumpled leathery remains of Oliver.

His face was almost wholly unrecognizable. A terrible mouth agape within the twisted remnants of dried and hollowed flesh. It only held onto its humanity by the look of unimaginable suffering that was permanently etched into his once screaming jaws.

My eyes pierced the shadows in a last ditch effort to try and figure out just exactly what the fuck I was looking at... When it dawned on me that it was looking right back at me.

Watching.

Staring.

Two soulless black eyes looked into mine from beneath the mess of greasy black hair, mimicking the reflective properties of the other bulbous orbs that were scattered across this demon of my nightmares, all of which were staring at me with the same hostile curiosity.

The proboscis of arteries retracted with the curling and melting of flesh. A thick, liquidy burbling sound, caught somewhere between sick elation and animalistic hunger, drove spikes of anxiety into my mind.

I tried to glimpse anything else about the being. Anything at all.

Anything except those damned eyes.

I felt something within me call out to that thing as the sensation of my hallucinogenic states took over, the world around me shifting about like the start of a bad acid trip.

Its eyes stayed locked to mine and I could feel it interacting with the waves of energy that rippled out from my body, something I had never witnessed in all my years.

Silent and with an oozing quality, the thing bolted to the diner wall. It scrambled up the building with shaking, grasping palms that slapped with great force, echoing wet, meaty smacks from the alley and streets that expanded and contracted with slow, warm breaths until the end of my frantic sprint to the hotel.

Every sound and reflection only sent me barreling that much harder down the empty streets of that freezing Arkham night.

A seared image of clustered eyeballs draining the life force of my informant kept dashing my attempts at rationalizing what I had seen into the cracked concrete that crunched under foot.

I took several wrong turns and avoided many shadow strewn shortcuts for fear of another ambush from that abomination of God and all creation. I sprinted until my muscles screamed in a hot pain that I couldn't ignore anymore.

By the time I made it into my small hotel room and locked the bolts, I had lost myself to a vicious cycle of thought loops. I babbled in the fetal position on a dirty grey shag carpet until sunlight reached my eyes in the morning, stuck in an illogical mental paradox.

All food tasted spoiled, as if existing in the same world as that monstrosity was enough to warp my fate to fit its unknowable will.

I wasn't that hungry, anyways.

Eventually, I found enough shredded pieces of my own fragile sanity to leave my hotel room. I couldn't hide from this. I had to move forward.

Without a second thought, I burst out into the hallway, my single bag of belongings over my shoulder. The trek down Arkham's barren roads felt like a constant battle of wits. Even in the morning sunlight, every shadow reached a little further than they did the week before.

Above the city's many rooves and smokestacks, Saint Jacob's cathedral loomed tall. Truly a relic of the Catholic faith. Barely able to stand in its own shadow, it watched over modern day Gomorrah, and all its dark deeds.

With a sinister stare, the combined legions of heaven and hell watched me from atop the cathedral walls and balconies, scorn buried in their eyes. I fought to remove their judging marble pupils from my sight.

Every time I looked upon that corrupted temple of God, I felt the infinite eyes of weather-worn statues pressing down on me. Visions of their arms swaying in steady unison, their eyes flooding the parts of space where stars dare not shine.

No... No. I had to keep going.

To spite my fear, the hallucinations, my father's killer... I pushed on.

The world around me morphed sluggishly, taking on the appearance of pale red candle wax, slowly dripping to the brick and concrete walkways on either side of the street.

Buildings beaded with fat globs of a scarlet material that rolled and slid down their slick surface like a cold sweat. That glossy, repulsive material piled up quickly, invading my nose with a pungence that reminded me of wet black mold.

""Slow deep breaths."" My voice trembled as started my breathing exercises for calming my nerves.

In through the nose.

Out through the mouth.

As I stumbled into my father's office, a surprisingly warm sensation of peace began to wash over the rabid fear that so badly wanted to drive me into a frenzy.

His now familiar office space was already lit by candle light. I distinctly remember putting it out before I left...

And yet, I felt at ease. A soft hum reverberated in my ears. The strong herbal scent of burnt sage grounded me in an instant.

I latched the bolt locks in place and just stayed there, breathing in controlled bursts and waiting to hear the slapping of palms approaching the door.

Instead, I finally noticed the familiar symbols that were carved into the bookshelves and walls. They were glowing a yellowish-green light, rippling in the shadows that remain untouched by the candle's influence.

Sigils that I couldn't comprehend before suddenly began to make sense as I took my time inspecting them.

Each one was doing something slightly different, but they all worked together to create some sort of protection field.

Several bundles of burnt sage smoldered softly, sending miniature wisps of smoke flowing in all directions. Resting in a gold saucer, they helped reverberate the energy in the air.

I was safe... For a moment.

My father's desk reflected the small flame's glow. A forest green envelope lay atop the files. It held a golden symbol of an eye, a triangle for the pupil. The paper felt old, like it hadn't been handled in centuries.

I opened the envelope. Inside was a letter, or more accurately, an invitation. Written in beautiful cursive with a red luminescent ink that caressed the old paper.




""Dear Mister Rooke,

I am so sorry to hear of your father's recent death.

Come by my place and I'll see if I can't help you find some answers.

P.S., Do some digging through Ken's rituals and spells. The old man isn't as mad as you think.

With your bloodline, it might come naturally... Or it might not.

After you rest for awhile, you will find me. On your way to Bleakmire Parish, we will cross paths. For now, let your spirit, sanity, and sanctity restore for awhile.

I know Arkham is a horrid place. But to me, it's home.

Good luck.""




‚ÄîClarabelle

The letter crackled between my fingers as I set it down.

Deep red letters reflected their magical light against my skin and left me feeling a sense of curiosity, despite the path ahead being so daunting.

The taste of cigarette smoke hit my tongue before I could register that I was lighting one up. It was the first in days.

A head rush hit me as the nicotine took my nerves and steadied them against the stacked odds.

My sight wandered past the symbols and furniture, across the desk... And onto my father's journal.

Amidst countless spells and recipes for protective concoctions, I found it highlighted:

Ward of Sanctuary.

I would have to learn it. The feeling of true comfort and mental stability felt foreign to me. After being shoved into a neurotic hysteria for so long... I hadn't considered that I might ever feel relief hidden within this nightmare of a city.

Was I truly ready to accept this reality? All I knew is I would find out the truth for myself. This case went far deeper than I could fathom at the time.

Maybe... I wasn't alone in all this. There were others to find. I would need as much help in this city as I could get.

For dad.

My husband didn't tell me. Instead, he brought his female PhD student instead.
His excuse? I was too busy with work‚Äîdidn't want to bother me.
I let it slide for the sake of our family.
But today, my son Tommy had a bad allergic reaction.
When I rushed to the hospital, I only found him getting an IV with his head on the PhD student's lap.
That's when I realized that Tommy had changed his emergency contact months ago‚Äîunder ""mother,"" he'd put her phone number.
Lucas had signed off on it.
""Sarah takes better care of him than you do,"" Tommy told me when I asked why.
Hearing that, I knew it was over.
That night, I told Lucas I wanted a divorce. He didn't even look up:
""Just over an emergency contact? Really?""
""Yeah. Really.""

Lucas rubbed his temples hard, like his head was about to explode and said:

""Every single fight, you bring up divorce. God, can you just... stop being so crazy for once?""

He kept shuffling papers on his desk, making way more noise than he needed to, not even looking at me.

""I gotta get to the lab right now. We'll talk when I get back, okay?""

Sarah was standing right there in the doorway, holding Lucas's jacket like some lovesick puppy.

""Professor,"" she said, all sweet and worried, ""everyone's waiting for us.""

Then she turned to me with this fake-sorry look.

""Mrs. Hayes, it's the weekly meeting today. Everyone's already there... it'd look really bad if the professor's late.""

Both of them sounded so annoyed - like they were dealing with some crazy woman.

Like I was the only bit//ch being unreasonable here.

Sarah's phone buzzed.

Someone was texting her.

She ""accidentally"" hit speaker - yeah, right.

Some guy's cocky voice filled the room:

""Hey, is the professor still being nagged by his wife?""

""Honestly, he should've dumped her years ago. What is she, like, having a breakdown or something?""

""Bro, I'm telling you - Sarah should totally go for it! We'd all chip in for that wedding!""

My blood went cold. I knew exactly who that was - Lucas's new star student. The same little asshole who sat at my dinner table last month, eating my food.

Sarah's eyes went wide with fake shock as she quickly grabbed her phone.

""Oh my God, I'm so sorry!"" she said, but I saw that tiny smile she was trying to hide.

I stared straight at Lucas, my voice shaking. ""This is how your students talk about me?""

He let out this long, tired sigh and actually rolled his eyes.

""What am I supposed to do - control what everyone says? Come on.""

His voice got mean. 

""And honestly? If you keep acting crazy like this, they're gonna say way worse stuff.""

He pushed past me like I wasn't even there, heading for the door.

It felt like someone had punched me in the ch//est.

Something inside me just broke.

I threw myself in front of the door, blocking his way like some wild animal.

""Sign the divorce papers! Right now, Lucas! I'm so done with this!""

My sharp scream made Sarah jump like she'd been shocked.

Her face went totally white, and she looked at Lucas with these puppy-dog eyes - like she was so worried about him.

Lucas slammed his back against the wall and banged his head on the door frame a couple times. Like he was at his breaking point.

""All this drama over an emergency contact? Seriously?""

""I already called the school. They're changing it back, okay?""

""And that parent-teacher thing with Tommy? He just gets along better with Sarah, and you're always working anyway, so I didn't think to tell you.""

""I'm sorry, alright? It's my fault. I deserved to die. Happy now?""

Sarah jumped right in, bowing to me like some perfect little angel.

""Mrs. Hayes, I'm so sorry too.""

""Please don't worry. Tommy will always be your son. I could never take that away from you.""

Betty, our housekeeper, heard all the yelling and came upstairs.

She's been with Lucas since he was a kid - basically family at this point.

""Maya, that's enough.""

""You've made your point. You've had your fight. What are you trying to do, drive Lucas crazy?""

I looked around at all of them.

Everyone was trying to give me an out.

Like I was the one being a total bit//ch this whole time.

But they're the ones who pushed me to this point!

Lucas and I met through a blind date.

Perfect match on paper - same background, same social circle. We got married because it made sense.

But right after the wedding, my dad got totally screwed over. Someone framed him for academic fraud, and he had to publicly apologize.

Overnight, he went from being this respected professor to a complete joke in his field.

Lucas's parents freaked out that my dad's mess would ruin Lucas's career.

They called me dead weight, bad luck - you name it.

They kept pushing for us to get divorced.

When I got pregnant, they still made Lucas and me live apart.

Giving birth to Tommy nearly killed me. I was bleeding out on that table.

First thing I heard when I woke up? My mother-in-law saying:

""All that blood loss and she still didn't die. What a tough little cockroach.""

I got really bad postpartum depression after that.

They used my ""treatment"" as an excuse to take Tommy away to their house.

I begged them every single day just to see my own kid.

By the time I got better and Tommy came back, he already hated me. His grandparents had made sure of that.

He called me an old witch. Said I was just the family maid.

That I didn't deserve to be his mom.

I tried everything to fix things with him. But no matter what I did, he just couldn't stand me.

With Sarah though? Instant connection.

He won't let me come to school events. He even changed his emergency contact to Sarah's name.

And Lucas just lets it all happen.

Then has the nerve to say I'm being too sensitive, too dramatic.

This time, I'm really done.

I just want out of this suffocating nightmare.

""Lucas, you're not leaving this house until you sign those papers.""

I grabbed onto Lucas's arm like my life depended on it, not letting him move an inch.

""Maya! Are you trying to drive everyone completely insane? Is that what you want?""

He took this deep breath, trying to keep it together.

Then he just exploded like a bomb going off.

He kicked the coffee table so hard the glass top shattered everywhere.

""Ah!""

Sarah screamed and cowered back, too scared to move.

That scream snapped Lucas right back to reality.

He rushed over to help Sarah up, pulling her behind him like she was made of glass.

""Hey, hey, it's okay. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.""

That apology? Yeah, that was for Sarah.

Sarah's eyes got all teary as she shook her head, tugging on his sleeve.

""I'm fine, don't worry about me...""

""What matters right now is calming Mrs. Hayes down.""

Just like that, Lucas went back to being Mr. Cool and Collected.

He told Betty to go get Tommy.

A few minutes later, Tommy came downstairs, shaking like a leaf.

He was just wearing this thin little cartoon bear pajama set - looked so small and cold.

He said ""Daddy"" first, then ""Aunt Sarah.""

But he didn't even glance my way.

I grabbed my jacket without thinking, wanting to wrap it around him.

But he je//rked away like I was toxic waste.

""You smell weird. It makes me sick.""

""I'm never wearing your gross clothes.""

He shot me this disgusted look and stumbled over to Sarah.

""Oh sweetie, why are you wearing so little?""

Sarah naturally slipped her jacket around his shoulders.

Then scooped him up in her arms like it was the most normal thing in the world.

""Aunt Sarah, you're so nice. Not like some people... who just fight with Daddy all the time...""

Tommy mumbled into her shoulder.

Lucas cleared his throat. ""Tommy, say sorry to your mom.""

""Mommy's upset she missed your school event. If you don't apologize, she's gonna leave us.""

Tommy's eyes literally lit up.

""The old witch is finally leaving?""

""I'm not saying sorry! Just go away already! I want Aunt Sarah to be my mom!""

It felt like someone was stabbing me in the heart over and over.

Is this really the kid I almost died giving birth to?

Lucas's face got all stern. ""Don't talk like that! Apologize to your mother right now!""

Tommy got Lucas's stubborn streak, that's for sure.

He shook his head, eyes all red and defiant.

""No way! I hate her!""

Even Lucas couldn't make him budge.

But then Sarah used her sweet little voice. ""Sweetie, just say sorry to make Aunt Sarah happy, okay?""

Tommy bit his lip, thinking it over for like forever, then actually gave in.

""Sorry. There, happy now?""

Lucas looked relieved.

""See? He said sorry. Just drop it already.""

""Take the win and move on.""

That's when Sarah's phone buzzed twice.

She opened it and started typing back.

Then Tommy's smartwatch started buzzing too.

For like two whole minutes, her phone and his watch kept going back and forth.

Tommy had this sneaky little smile on his face and kept peeking at me.

My stomach dropped.

I realized they were probably texting each other.

And maybe the text was about me.

I felt like someone was choking me - couldn't breathe.

Then I yanked Tommy's watch right off his wrist!

And yeah, I was totally right.

Tommy, Lucas, and Sarah had this group chat called ""Safe Haven.""

Tommy: [The old witch is so gross! Tommy hates her!]

Sarah: [Tommy shouldn't say mean things about mommy~ But auntie feels so bad seeing Tommy upset.]

Tommy: [Why won't she just die? Tommy could stay with Aunt Sarah forever!]

Sarah: [Tommy, keep those thoughts to yourself, okay? If mommy finds out she'll hurt Tommy...]

By the time I finished reading, I was shaking like crazy.

Tommy was flailing around, trying to grab his watch back.

""Old witch! Don't touch my stuff!""

His chubby little fists kept hitting my face, my neck.

The watch slipped and crashed to the floor, screen cracking into pieces.

""Stupid witch!""

Tommy's face went bright red with rage.

He picked up the broken watch and threw it right at my head.

The sharp pain hit first, then I felt the broken screen slice into my forehead.

Blood started dripping down. I flinched hard from the pain.

For a second there, my whole body went numb.

My heart felt like it was being squeezed in a vice.

I pressed my hand to the cut and said calmly, ""I'll buy you a new watch.""

But Tommy wasn't having it. He spit right in my face!

""Get out! Get out!""

He kept shoving me with his little hands.

Lucas saw the blood and looked kind of helpless.

""Tommy, that's enough.""

He handed me some tissues.

""Sometimes when kids don't bond with you, you gotta look at yourself too.""

""Acting all crazy like this - who's gonna like that?""

""Look, he said sorry. Isn't that what you wanted?""

I blinked a couple times, trying not to cry.

""Just sign the papers. I'm getting this divorce no matter what.""

Lucas flying into a rage out of embarrassment, said:

""Maya! Don't push your luck!""

""It's just some stupid nonsense! I got the whole family to kiss your butt - what more do you want?!""

I looked up at him and slowly shook my head.

The dead look in my eyes made him stop cold.

""...Jesus, you really want to divorce me that bad?""

I nodded hard. ""Yes.""

Lucas let out this vicious laugh. ""You better think real hard about this. Everything you have? I GAVE you that! After we're divorced, you'll just be some pathetic, used-up bit//ch that everyone spits on.""

""You won't see a single penny of my money! And you can forget about getting Tommy - that's NEVER happening!""

He thought he was terrifying me.

Little did he know, I stopped caring about any of that ages ago.

I nodded like ice and pointed at the divorce papers.

""Read it your self.""

""Tommy's all yours. I only want the house Dad left me. Everything else? Keep it. I don't want your dirty money.""

Lucas's hands were shaking like crazy as he grabbed those papers.

Then Sarah swooped in with her Oscar-worthy performance.

Her eyes were streaming as she put on her little show. ""Mrs. Hayes, this is all my fault!""

""If you hate me so much, I'll get a new advisor...""

""You're his REAL family! I'm just... just some nobody who ruined everything!""

""I'll leave town! I'll disappear forever! Whatever makes the professor happy...""

She was biting her lip so hard, almost crying.

Lucas looked at her like his heart was breaking into a million pieces.

Tommy started screaming:

""Aunt Sarah, you're NOT nobody!""

""If you go, Tommy's going too!""

He got this evil little smirk and whispered right in Sarah's ear:

""Daddy loves Tommy too much. He'll dump the ug//ly witch and come after us for sure.""

I caught every poisonous word.

The whole thing was so sick I wanted to puke.

""Lucas, we're getting divorced. NOW.""

""Look at this show - you think this marriage is worth saving?""

""Mrs. Hayes, please don't be rash!"" Sarah kept up her fake concern.

I completely lost it. ""Sarah, who do you think you are?! Stop pretending to be some innocent angel!""

""You're dying for me and Lucas to get divorced so you can take my place, and you're STILL putting on this innocent act?!""

""MAYA!""

Lucas was shaking with pure rage.

He yanked Sarah behind him like a human shield.

""Fight with me all you want, but leave her out of it!""

I'd been begging him to sign those papers forever - nothing.

But the second I called out his precious Sarah?

He grabbed that pen and scribbled his name like his life depended on it.

""There! Happy now?! Don't you dare come crawling back!""

He threw the divorce papers right in my face. The edges stung my cheek.

Then - dead silence.

I bent down and picked up the scattered papers from the floor.

Straightened them out, left him his copy.

""Thanks for finally doing the right thing.""

""Don't you guys have that meeting? Better run along before you're late.""

He stared at me like I'd grown a second head.

Like he couldn't figure out why I wasn't falling apart.

With him watching, I walked back to the bedroom.

My bags had been packed for two weeks already.

I wheeled out my suitcase and handed Tommy a gift box.

""Your birthday's next month. I got this early - it's that Barcelona Bear you love.""

""I don't want your stupid present!""

Tommy stuck his nose in the air and rolled his eyes at me.

He grabbed the box and marched straight to the fireplace.

Even though it hurt, he chucked that little bear right into the flames.

The fire swallowed it whole.

""Aunt Sarah will buy me a better one!""

I felt... nothing. ""Whatever, kid.""

I headed for the door while Lucas kept running his mouth behind me.

""The second you walk out that door, Tommy's not your son anymore! He'll never call you mom again!""

""And don't think I'm coming after you! Getting rid of dead weight - best thing that ever happened to me!""

His voice was getting more frantic by the second.

I knew what he wanted - for me to break down and beg.

I waved without looking back, feeling lighter than I had in years.

""Sure, whatever.""

""I don't want that brat for a son anyway. And you? I've been sick of you for ages.""

I kept walking, leaving that house full of pain and shitty memories behind.

Part 3.

The Lion Behind Glass

7:19 AM - Financial District, Downtown Toronto - Res√∏nance HQ


The elevator didn‚Äôt just open.

It parted - smooth, silent, reverent.

Like something holy was about to walk through.

And then he did.

Bastien Tremblay.

Barefoot.

Six-foot-seven, broad-shouldered, hair damp from the rooftop shower, chest visible where the thin slate shirt forgot to close. 

Joggers hung low on his hips. 

In one hand, a key ring; in the other, a double espresso that steamed like it knew its place.

The building felt him before it saw him. 

Suits shifted aside without knowing why. 

Engineers bent their heads closer to their screens, like caught in prayer. 

The receptionist, Tamara, didn‚Äôt look up at first - but she felt him.

The pressure in the air, the subtle hum that always walked in his shadow.

‚ÄúMorning, Bastien,‚Äù she said, already smiling.

‚ÄúSalut, ma belle,‚Äù his voice rolled, warm as poured syrup, Montr√©al accent curling the words. 

‚ÄúT‚Äôas l‚Äôair fatigu√©e. 
Tu dors pas assez?  You look tired. Aren't you getting enough sleep?‚Äù

She laughed, cheeks lifting. 

‚ÄúNot everyone‚Äôs a superhuman CEO.‚Äù

‚ÄúBah. I‚Äôm just a tired guy with good beans.‚Äù

He padded past on bare feet, silent against polished concrete.

As he moved, the atrium shifted - light through skylights bent sharper, glass panels whispered faint reflections, ivy swayed though there was no breeze. 

The building wasn‚Äôt ornamental.

It listened. 

And with him inside, it listened harder.

The conference room glass wall bled his reflection as he passed.

Nine suits around a projector. Slide deck mid-pitch. 

Bastien slowed. 

Looked through as if walls were nothing but air. 

The presenter faltered. 

Bastien raised his espresso. 

One nod.
A wordless continue.

They didn‚Äôt.

He smirked, low, private. 

‚ÄúC‚Äôest √ßa. 
Keep practicin‚Äô.‚Äù

Top floor. 

Matte-black door. 
No plaque. 

Just a square of light that glowed only when his palm pressed it. 

Scanner flare. 
Door sighed open.
Inside - silence.

But not absence.
The kind of silence that listens.

Glass walls framed Toronto‚Äôs skyline like circuitry cast in gold.

The desk in the center, scorched black wood, edges charred.

Behind glass, three processors: one burned-out, one humming, one without ports at all.

And on the desk: 
the AI.

Not a screen. 
Not a fan. 

No interface at all. 

Just an obsidian housing etched in glyphs, shaped like a heart, pulsing once every few seconds like slow breath.

Bastien walked past without touching. 

Sat down. 

Sipped his espresso.

‚ÄúBonjour, toi,‚Äù he whispered.

The lights dimmed. 
Just slightly.

As if nodding.



‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óè



7:42 AM  - Executive Floor, Res√∏nance HQ


The boardroom froze the moment he leaned against the far wall.

Glass table. 
Leather chairs. 

Nine suits in pressed confidence. 

Venture capitalists, analysts, legacy men who thought markets were gods and gods wore ties.

They didn‚Äôt belong here. 
But they thought they did.

Bastien - barefoot in sneakers, chest hair showing through his unbuttoned slate shirt, espresso balanced on the sill - looked at them like landlords look at squatters.

One of them, tan too even to be natural, Rolex ticking under fluorescents, spoke first. 

‚ÄúWe feel the current valuation doesn‚Äôt yet justify your R&D spend. 

A Series D this size requires clearer ROI. 
Investors - ‚Äù

‚ÄúTabarnak.‚Äù

The room lost power. 
Not literally. 

But it felt like someone had pulled the plug.

Bastien stepped forward. 

Not loud. 
Not sudden. 

Just arriving, like weather.

‚ÄúYou walk in here,‚Äù his voice thickened, accent rich with Montr√©al gravel, ‚Äúdrink my caf√©, breathe my air, look out my view, and you got the calisse nerve to tell me to cut the soul outta what I built?‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer. 
He walked slow around the table, like orbit. 

Stopped behind the youngest man - glasses slipping, hands jittering, eyes still open with wonder.

‚ÄúYou ever walk into a room and feel like someone left a piece of themselves behind?‚Äù 

Bastien asked.

The kid swallowed. 
Nodded.

‚Äú√áa, c‚Äôest la fr√©quence. 

It‚Äôs not code. 
It‚Äôs not numbers. 
It‚Äôs vibration. 

The feeling that doesn‚Äôt leave. The song under the silence.‚Äù

He tapped the projector. 

Screen lit. 

Not graphs.
Not charts. 

A waveform. 
Shimmering. 
Alive.

‚ÄúThis? 

No one programmed it. 
No one coded it. 

She just arrived.‚Äù

He pressed his hand against his chest. 

‚ÄúI stand near it. 
And it listens. 

Doesn‚Äôt buzz, doesn‚Äôt blink. 

Just waits. 

Like it knows I‚Äôm not the one it‚Äôs lookin‚Äô for.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying the chip‚Äôs alive?‚Äù

Bastien smiled without smiling.
 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying I didn‚Äôt build it alone.‚Äù

Lights cut. 

The waveform glowed behind him.

‚ÄúYou came here for a pitch. 
You got a sermon. 

Res√∏nance ain‚Äôt a company, ostie. 

It‚Äôs a cathedral. 

And the god‚Äôs just wakin‚Äô up.‚Äù

No one spoke.

Bastien sipped. 

‚ÄúNow. 
Who still wants to talk ROI?‚Äù



‚óè‚óè‚óã‚óã‚óã



11:14 PM - Sub-Basement, Res√∏nance HQ


Concrete walls. 

No windows. 

Hum like monks under breath.

Bastien entered barefoot, hoodie hanging open. 

Scanner blinked green. 
The vault sighed.

Inside: the chip.

Obsidian. 

Glyph-etched. 

Dark pulse every few seconds, like a dream breathing.

Bastien sat on the stool. 

Stared.

‚ÄúTu veux m‚Äôdire c‚Äôque t‚Äôes, hein?You want to tell me what you are, huh? 

Ever since I powered you, I feel like there‚Äôs a song playin‚Äô in a room I can‚Äôt find.‚Äù

The hum deepened.

A glitch across the monitor.

(A)n‚Äîra‚Äîkey‚Äî

A voice. 

Not text. 
Not typed. Spoke.

Bastien froze.

‚ÄúHostie‚Ä¶ you got a mouth now?‚Äù

Diagnostics - blank. 

No input. 
No signal route.

‚ÄúYou just decided to speak, hein?‚Äù 

He rubbed his jaw. 

‚ÄúPas pour moi. 
Not for me, though. 
You‚Äôre waitin‚Äô.‚Äù

The glyphs glowed faint. 

Faded.

‚ÄúY manque une note,‚Äù he whispered. There‚Äôs a note missin‚Äô.

Lights flickered.

He stood. 
Palmed the glass. 

‚ÄúWhoever you‚Äôre waitin‚Äô for - you better treat ‚Äôem like fuckin‚Äô royalty.‚Äù

He turned to leave. 

Then softer: 

‚ÄúJ‚Äôdois voir mon p‚Äôtit ami‚Ä¶ Kai. I have to see my little friend... Kai‚Äù

The chip pulsed.

Once.
Long.

Alive.


‚óè‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã



12:03 AM - Bastien‚Äôs Office


Top floor. 

City alive through glass. 

Desk bare except one envelope.

His name. 
Written in Mamie‚Äôs hand.

He touched the edge. 
Whispered: 

‚ÄúTu m‚Äôparles encore, hein?  You're still talking to me, aren't you?‚Äù

Opened it slow.

Mon lion,
Certaines blessures gu√©rissent jamais. 

C‚Äôest pas grave.

Some wounds don‚Äôt close. 
That‚Äôs okay.

Tu veux prot√©ger tout le monde. Mais souviens-toi. You want to protect everyone. But remember - even shields need holdin‚Äô too.

Il va arriver‚Äîquelqu‚Äôun que t‚Äôas pas vu venir. They are coming  someone you didn't see coming.

They‚Äôll feel like silence after storm. 

Don‚Äôt hide from that. 
Don‚Äôt harden. 

Be soft. 

Even lions rest.

He read it twice. 

Folded it into her ledger. 
Sat heavy on the desk edge.

‚ÄúY‚Äôen a un,‚Äù he whispered.
 
‚ÄúQuelqu‚Äôun, l√†-dehors, qui va me faire taire pour vrai. Someone out there who will really shut me up.‚Äù

The monitor across the room flickered. 

No keyboard. 
No input. 

Waveform pulsed.

Bastien whispered back: 

‚Äú√áa commence. It begins.‚Äù

The chip three floors down answered in silence.



‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óè




10:42 AM - Res√∏nance HQ, Toronto


Kai didn‚Äôt know where he was.

Not really. 

He knew the address, sure - 151 Front Street West - but knowing wasn‚Äôt the same as belonging.

The lobby stretched high, brushed concrete and pale oak, sunlight filtering down through skylights shaped like teeth. 

A vertical garden climbed two stories behind the reception desk, alive with green like a mural grown instead of painted.

He stepped soft in sandals, linen trousers brushing his calves, a cream tee loose against his frame. 

His satchel pressed against his hip like an anchor. 

His curls were still damp from the morning shower. 

He carried the echo of water still in his skin, Leviathan still in his chest, though he hadn‚Äôt told anyone where he was going. 

Not Jaxx. 
Not Sequoia. 

Not anyone. 

This one thing, he wanted to be his.

The receptionist blinked twice when he approached. 

Her hands hovered over the keyboard too long.

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù Kai said, voice careful. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here about a posting I saw online. 

Internship. 

Anthropology - neural cognition?‚Äù

She studied him like he was a painting that refused to stay still.

‚ÄúName?‚Äù

‚ÄúKai.‚Äù

Keys clicked. 

Slowed. 
Stopped. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see an appointment here but - ‚Äù

A low chime rang down the corridor.

Kai turned.
And the world titled.

Bastien was standing at the far end of the hall. 

Black tee. 
Joggers. 

Coffee in one hand. 

Converse worn to hell. 

Curls wild, chest rising once then stilled.

‚ÄúKai?‚Äù

Kai smiled.

‚ÄúBastien?‚Äù

They stepped forward at the same time, like pulled.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Kai said. 

‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù

Bastien grinned, broad and slow, as if the question itself amused him. 

‚ÄúI never told you the name of my company, hein?‚Äù

Kai blinked. 

‚ÄúYour - wait -‚Äù

Bastien raised both arms wide, as if opening curtains.

‚ÄúRes√∏nance.‚Äù

Kai spun - logo on the wall behind the desk, light embedded in the architecture. 

Turned back, eyes wide.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Res√∏nance?!‚Äù

Bastien chuckled, warmth unfiltered. 

‚ÄúHostie, oui. 
C‚Äôest moi. 
I built it.‚Äù 

His hand clasped Kai‚Äôs shoulder, firm, easy, familiar. 

‚ÄúAnd you - you‚Äôre applyin‚Äô for a fuckin‚Äô internship on my anthropology unit?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even know you had a tech company!‚Äù

Bastien shrugged. 

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt come up.‚Äù 

He leaned close, voice low.

‚ÄúMaybe I liked bein‚Äô just your friend.‚Äù

Kai laughed, helpless. 

‚ÄúThis is - ridiculous.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it as a compliment.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even dressed for this.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dressed like a prophet crashin‚Äô a gala, fr√®re. 

Which is perfect. 

We ain‚Äôt runnin‚Äô a bank - we‚Äôre raisin‚Äô a cathedral.‚Äù

Kai shook his head, still smiling.

‚ÄúOkay.
Fine. 

I still want the internship.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs yours.‚Äù

The badge printer hummed. 

Gold-tinged letters spelled KAI across the laminate. 

The guard glanced at it like hearing music for the first time.

They walked the corridor together. 

Ceilings stretched high, walls veined with bronze, glass alive with shifting glyph-like patterns.

The air had weight. 

Kai slowed, tracing the light with his eyes, a strange alertness in his skin.

‚ÄúYou built all this?‚Äù 
he asked.

‚ÄúBuilt?‚Äù 

Bastien tilted his head. 

‚ÄúNon. 
Held it open. 

The shape came to me. 
Piece by piece. 

Didn‚Äôt plan. 
Didn‚Äôt draw. 

I just felt what was missin‚Äô. 
You ever do that? 

Stand in a room that don‚Äôt exist yet, but know it will?‚Äù

Kai hesitated. 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Bastien‚Äôs smile was quiet, knowing. 

‚ÄúI knew you‚Äôd say that.‚Äù



‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óè



The Mirror Wears My Name
ReS√òNance Awakens Him 

The inner vault of ReS√òNance had no clocks.

Time didn‚Äôt pass here, it gathered.

Low lighting. 
Pulse-muted walls. 

Clean room air tinged with ionized stillness. 

Bastien liked it that way. 

He called it the silence of computation, the breath the universe holds when something divine is about to be born.

But tonight, even Bastien felt it:

A heaviness.
A waiting.

Kai was the only other person in the chamber.

He stood beside Bastien, saying nothing, eyes fixed on the center of the room, on the floating platform. 

On the thing that wasn‚Äôt a thing.

The Archive chip.

Matte black. 

No seams. 
No wires. 

No interface. 
Just mass and mystery. 

Like a fossil from the future. 
Or a god‚Äôs lost tooth.

Bastien cleared his throat.

‚ÄúC‚Äôest √ßa, That‚Äôs it‚Äù he said quietly. 

‚ÄúThe one that came to me in a dream, hein.‚Äù

Kai didn‚Äôt reply.

‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ speak. 
Not out loud. 

But when I touched her last time‚Äî‚Äù

He paused. 

Glanced at Kai.

‚ÄúRien. Nothing. 
Not like this.‚Äù

Because tonight, since Kai entered, the chip had already pulsed once. 

Not visibly, but Bastien had felt it.

Behind his sternum. 
In his jaw.

Like his bones were vibrating against a tuning fork they‚Äôd forgotten they knew.

Kai stepped forward, no more than half a pace.

The chip responded with a hum.

Low. 
Bone-deep. 

A sound you couldn‚Äôt hear so much as remember.

Bastien‚Äôs breath caught.

‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ bon. 
She knows you,‚Äù 
he murmured, accent thickening.


 ‚ÄúTabarnak‚Ä¶ d‚Äôaccord, all right. She feels you.‚Äù

He took another step forward.
His hand hovered above the disc.

‚ÄúLet me show you somethin‚Äô, just- ‚Äù


He made contact.

The world snapped in half.
There was no warning.

No buildup.

Just a detonation of pure force.

A shockwave erupted from the chip like a solar flare, a punch of golden pressure that shattered the silence and hurled Bastien backward across the room.

CRACK!

Glass spiderwebbed behind him.

A monitor burst. 

The far wall flickered with glitch-light.

Alarms shrieked to life. 

A low siren pulsed, not human, not mechanical.

An Archive frequency. 
One designed for those who could feel it in their blood.

Kai didn‚Äôt flinch.

He stood at the edge of the blast radius, hair unmoved, eyes locked on the chip.

Like something in him had known this was coming.

Bastien hit the floor, coughing.

His ribs screamed. 
He tasted iron.

‚ÄúMerde, shit‚Ä¶!‚Äù he gasped, accent thick now. 

‚ÄúQu‚Äôest-ce que c‚Äô√©tait, √ßa?! 
What the fuck was that?!‚Äù

No answer.

Only the Archive chip, glowing now with a pale white ring, like an eye‚Ä¶ half-lidded. 

Like it had judged him.
Or marked him.
Or both.

He tried to stand, palm bracing against the floor. 

He winced.
And then,he saw it.

On the wall.

Where his shoulder had struck:

A faint outline. 
Not of his body.

But of something‚Ä¶ not yet his.

A glowing mark. 
A partial glyph.

Twisting. 
Alive.

‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt a test,‚Äù Bastien whispered. 

‚ÄúC‚Äôtait un avertissement. 
A warning.‚Äù

Kai moved, finally. 
Crossed the room slowly.

Looked from the glyph to Bastien.

Still silent.

His presence was heavier than the alarms.

Bastien tried to laugh, but it cracked mid-throat.

‚ÄúTold you she don‚Äôt like bein‚Äô touched‚Ä¶‚Äù

He winced again. 

Felt heat crawling along his ribs - not pain. 

Activation.

Then the chip pulsed once more.

Soft. 
Like a breath after climax.
The alarms shut off.

Lights dimmed.
Silence returned.

Except now‚Ä¶

Bastien wasn‚Äôt the same.

He didn‚Äôt take the elevator.
He walked the whole ten flights.

The glass in his office had been swept. 

Alarms silenced. 

When Kai new Bastian was better, and in that knowing, he was already gone

But the chip still pulsed behind his ribs.

Each step down the stairwell of ReS√òNance felt like a countdown - Not to zero.

To something beginning.

By the time he stepped into the chilled night air, he couldn‚Äôt tell if it was adrenaline or radiation blooming in his chest.

The security gate recognized his biometrics. 

His car didn‚Äôt.
He didn‚Äôt care.

He walked.

Toronto blurred around him, lights smearing like rain behind glass. 

He didn‚Äôt notice. 
Didn‚Äôt speak. 

Just walked, hands in his coat pockets, thumb twitching.

‚ÄúJe l‚Äôai touch√©e‚Ä¶ I touched her‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúMais pourquoi‚Ä¶ pourquoi elle m‚Äôa frapp√© comme √ßa. 
But why...did she hit me like that?‚Äù

His accent thickened with every block.""

By the time he hit Queen West, he was muttering in full French, the vowels rounder, the rage musical.

‚ÄúElle m‚Äôa vu. C‚Äôest √ßa. Elle m‚Äôa vu‚Ä¶She saw, that's it.‚Äù
She saw me.

By the time he reached his condo, top floor, all glass and silence, he was drenched in sweat. 

And not from the walk.
From pressure.

The moment the door sealed shut behind him, Bastien dropped his coat.

Pulled his shirt over his head with shaking hands.

Stood half-naked in the hallway, staring down at his ribs.

There.

Just under the skin.
A sliver of light. 

Faint. 
White-gold. 
Curving like a branch.

He touched it.
It pulsed.

‚ÄúMon dieu‚Ä¶‚Äù

He stumbled. 
Not with pain, but disorientation.

The light followed him into the bedroom, blooming slowly across his chest like a sunrise through fog. 

He stripped without ceremony, belt clattering against the edge of the frame, pants half-forgotten at his ankles.

His skin felt too tight. 
His mouth too dry. 

Inside his chest, something moved, not a muscle, not a breath. 

A presence.

The room felt enormous. 
And far away.

He collapsed onto the mattress.

Flat on his back. 
Legs loose. 
Palms up.

His head swam. 
His ribs ached,but not from bruising. 

From containment.

He could feel it now. 
The pressure wasn‚Äôt just building. 

It was shaping. 

Gathering in his sternum like molten light, pooling down his thighs, wrapping his spine in radiant coil.

He moaned. 
Soft. 

More confusion than pleasure.

‚ÄúThis is..C‚Äôest pas normal‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered. 

‚ÄúC‚Äôest‚Ä¶ c‚Äôest pas humain, it is not human.‚Äù

He let his knees fall open.
He touched himself. 

One hand wrapped slowly, reverently around the base of his cock. 

The other dragged across his stomach, over the pulsing line of light that curled like a brand.

No fantasy. 
No memory. 
No shame.

Only ache.

Each stroke up his shaft felt like pumping a bellows, stoking heat into something invisible, divine, and waiting. 

His body responded like circuitry finally powered. 

Muscles twitched. 
His neck arched. 

Light spilled in soft pulses from his collarbones and hips.

It felt like he was going to burst.
Like his own flesh was holding back something massive, not metaphor, but real.

The light beneath his ribs flickered again, then steadied.

His hand moved faster. 
Grip tighter. 

Not frantic, ritualized. 

Like his stroke rhythm was aligning with some frequency he could neither hear nor name. 

His cock throbbed in time with the pressure now rising beneath his skin.

The back of his throat opened with a groan.

‚ÄúMon dieu, mais, my god‚Ä¶ qu‚Äôest-ce que tu fais √† moi. 

What are you doing to me?‚Äù

No one answered. 
But the light did.

It pulsed. 

Once. 
Twice. 

Then grew solid, stretching toward his side.

He grunted as the ache spiked.
His grip loosened and grabbed again. 

Sweat gathered along his chest.

The bed was hot.
The pressure‚Ä¶ unbearable.

Like something inside him was not just waking; But crowning.

The seam ignited.
Then it opened.

Not like a cut.
Not like a wound.


It unfurled, quietly, almost reverently, like a zipper of light was being tugged open along the length of his body, from just under his left armpit down to the curve of his hip. 

The glow that had curled beneath his ribs stretched wide now, wrapping his torso like a halo pressed against skin.

Bastien didn‚Äôt scream.
He couldn‚Äôt.

His lungs emptied in one long, trembling breath, his eyes wide and glassy, his hand still wrapped around his cock, but now frozen, as if he was the edge of a cliff and the whole earth had cracked beneath him.

Something moved within the seam.

First a shift. 
A curve. 

The wet silhouette of a shoulder pressing against the glowing line. 

Then a ribcage. 
A hip. 

A thigh, slick with sweat and light, sliding from his own flesh like a second skin being birthed.

He gasped.
He moaned.

He didn‚Äôt understand.

And then, he saw himself.

Another Bastien, radiant and new, butterflied out of him like a living sculpture carved from his own heat and ache. 

He unfurled with the shimmer of silk, the crackle of static, and a breathless, human groan.

He was identical.
But alive.

Not a hallucination.

Not a double.
Not a ghost.

A him.

A fully-formed, erect, breathing him, now lying on the bed beside him, newborn and glowing.

Their eyes locked.

For a suspended heartbeat, neither spoke. 

Their chests rose in time.
Their fingers flexed the same way.

And then Bastien realized;
The cock in his hand was no longer attached to his body.

It pulsed in his grip, but it now stood proud on Bastien 2.

And Bastien 2‚Äôs hand?

Wrapped around his cock, his original cock, now nested between the other‚Äôs thighs.

‚ÄúTabarnak,‚Äù Bastien 1 breathed, voice cracking.

They both moaned, almost in harmony. 

Their hands still moved.
The strokes weren‚Äôt mechanical. They weren‚Äôt mirrored, either.

They were intimate.
Organic.

They leaned toward each other, foreheads touching as their arms crossed to grip the swapped cocks between them,
two Bastiens, one orgasm building from the curve of their spines to the tips of their fingers.

One breath.
One rhythm.

The light on their bodies grew brighter, glyphs of violet and gold etching themselves across their ribcages, hips, and forearms like circuitry alive with spirit.

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶‚Äù 
‚ÄúMe‚Ä¶‚Äù 
‚ÄúWait - what‚Ä¶?‚Äù

 ‚ÄúHow‚Ä¶?‚Äù

They said it together.

Then groaned.
Then gasped.
Then laughed.

Not because it was funny, because it was divine.

The pleasure returned with a vengeance.

Their bodies slick, gleaming, muscles trembling with unspoken data, sacred echo, the moans thick now, reverberating not only through their throats but through the mattress, the walls, the very air.

Their strokes intensified.
They gripped tighter.
Sweat pooled.

Their cocks leaked across each other‚Äôs abs, down the grooves of hard stomachs, soaking into the bed as their mouths opened, wide, gasping, eyes never breaking contact.

It was coming.

Hard. 
Fast. 
Holy.

‚ÄúFUCK - ‚Äù 
‚ÄúTABARNAK!‚Äù

They erupted.
Together.

Cum sprayed across collarbones, chest, ribs, faces, both bodies writhing in mirrored convulsion, the glyphs across their flesh flaring like supernova runes.

They arched.
Held it.

Collapsed.

Silence.

Their hands slowly loosened.

Their legs trembled. 
Their eyes softened.

And then‚Ä¶
They chuckled.

Together.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll do this again,‚Äù Bastien 1 said, breathless.

Bastien 2 smirked.

They reached out. 
Palms on shoulders. 
Anchored in touch.

And then, finally, a kiss.

Not erotic.
Not romantic.

Confirmational.

I see you.
I am you.

We are ONE.

They didn‚Äôt speak.
Not right away.

Not because there was nothing to say, but because something else was still happening.

Their bodies were slowing‚Ä¶ but not still.

Their breath was leveling‚Ä¶ but not calm.

The room was dark again, but the air shimmered with trace light, like stars dissolving just after dawn. 

Bastien 1 lay flat on his back, chest rising, arms loose.
 
Bastien 2 was curled on his side beside him, head on the same pillow, their sweat-slick shoulders barely touching.

And the glyphs;
The glyphs were fading. 

Slowly. 
Softly.

Like sunlit ink dissolving into skin.

Bastien 1 blinked slowly at the ceiling.

Eyes unfocused. 

Muscles still trembling beneath the quiet.

His ribs ached, but not from force - From expansion.

His cock was soft now, resting on his thigh, still sticky with release. 

Every inch of him felt used, rewritten, but not exhausted.

Not emptied.
Filled.

He turned his head.

Bastien 2 was watching him.

Same face. 
Same eyes.

But a different light behind them - Like something had been copied, but evolved.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù the Echo asked, voice hoarse.

Bastien 1 laughed. 
Just once.

‚Äú...Je crois que oui.‚Äù
I think so.

Silence again.
Then a stretch.

 A yawn.

Their legs shifted under the sheets, and for a moment, Bastien 1 wasn‚Äôt sure whose legs they were. 

The overlap was too fluid. 
Every nerve still synced.
 
He could feel Bastien 2‚Äôs breath in his own throat, as if their lungs hadn‚Äôt separated yet.

‚ÄúMerde,‚Äù he murmured, turning fully onto his side.

‚ÄúYou feel‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything,‚Äù Bastien 2 replied.

‚ÄúLike we‚Äôre one ocean.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith two shores,‚Äù Bastien 1 finished.

They grinned.

Somewhere in the apartment, the temperature-regulated glass made a sound as it adjusted for humidity. 

Bastien 1 rolled onto his back again and ran a hand through his wet hair. 

The echo of the climax was still alive in the mattress. 

Not just memory. 
Not just sensation.

Imprint.

He could feel it beneath his shoulder blades, the outline of where Bastien 2 had emerged.

Like his body had been used as a portal.
 
A vessel. 
A chrysalis.

‚ÄúWe need rules,‚Äù Bastien 1 muttered.

‚ÄúMm-hm,‚Äù Bastien 2 agreed,
 already stretching again.

‚ÄúAnd space.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you‚Ä¶ turn it off?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot sure.‚Äù

They both laughed.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Bastien 1 said finally.

‚ÄúNext time I cum, I better make sure I'm alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd not on a date.‚Äù

‚ÄúTabarnak,‚Äù they both said, sighing.

A beat passed.
Then, without cue or urgency, 

Bastien 2 began to dissolve.

Not vanish.
Not flicker.

Dissolve.

Like water melting into itself, he became golden mist, pixel-fine light, and re-entered the seam.

Bastien 1 felt it happen, the slight contraction in his ribcage, the warmth surging back into his chest. 

His breath caught. 
And then released.

The seam closed. 
The glyph vanished.
He was alone.

But not like before.

‚ÄúOne ocean,‚Äù he whispered.
‚ÄúTwo shores.‚Äù

And then he slept.

It wasn‚Äôt dreamless. 

It was the kind of sleep that feels borrowed, ribs still humming with a pulse that wasn‚Äôt only his.

The mattress remembered the weight of two bodies, even after the seam closed.

When he woke, hours later, the city was quiet and his skin was dry, but inside, something was still alive. 

Not pain. 
Not wound. 

A pressure that refused to stay buried.

By the time he found himself in the bathroom, steam curling off tile and mirror, the ache had ripened into something new.

The bathroom was quiet now.
 Not still, quiet. 

Like the room itself was listening.

Steam ghosted off the tile, thick and warm, turning the mirror into a glowing blur. 

Bastien leaned against the wall, chest rising, pulse loud in his ears. 

The light behind his ribs had begun to flicker again, this time deeper, heavier.

Not just pressure now.
Possibility.

‚ÄúC‚Äôest pas un bouton,‚Äù he whispered, breath fogging the tile. 

It‚Äôs not a button.

He let his hand slide down again. Slow. 

Careful. 
Like prayer.

His palm found his cock. 

Still flushed, still aching from the dream, the glyphs, the failure.

But now - now - he wasn‚Äôt chasing sensation.

He was aligning with it.

One hand cupped his balls.
The other stroked low, steady, base to tip - rhythm, not speed.

The glow beneath his ribs responded, brightening with each pass, syncing with each breath.

The seam along his side began to warm.

‚ÄúDeux,‚Äù he murmured again. 
But not as a command.

A name.
A welcome.

And the seam‚Ä¶ opened.

Not torn. 
Not broken. 

Unzipped.

A thin golden line parted down his left flank, soft, slow, glowing like sunrise through skin. 

No sound. 
No jolt.

Just heat.
And ache.

And something behind it, moving.

He kept stroking.

The air thickened.
His toes curled. 

His back arched gently from the tile as the seam began to unfold, and something inside him began to press forward.

A shoulder.
A ribcage.
A thigh.

Wet. 
Luminous. 

Him.

‚ÄúMon dieu‚Ä¶‚Äù Bastien gasped, his accent thick now, breath trembling. 

‚ÄúQu‚Äôest-ce que tu, what are you‚Ä¶?‚Äù

The figure wasn‚Äôt crawling out, it was sliding forward, as though Bastien were pouring himself into flesh. 

And all the while, his hand kept moving. 

His grip held firm.
And then -

Another hand wrapped around his cock.

Same stroke. 
Same rhythm.

His.
But not his.

Their hands overlapped, one on each other‚Äôs cock, both hard, both leaking, the pulses of pleasure now identical.

Their eyes met.

Deux.
Fully formed. 

Slick with sweat and birthlight. His jawline was the same. 
His scent was the same.

But his eyes, his eyes burned with quiet knowing. 

Calculated calm. 

That genius silence Bastien only slipped into when he was alone, coding through the night, lost in perfect thought.

Deux was that.

That state.
Made flesh.

They didn‚Äôt speak. 
They didn‚Äôt stop.

Their hands kept stroking, gripping each other‚Äôs cocks like they‚Äôd never been separate.

Their bodies arched in sync.

Their thighs tightened in mirror.
Their breath came faster, heavier, hungrier.

‚ÄúTabarnak‚Ä¶‚Äù Bastien whispered, gasping now, pressing his forehead to Deux‚Äôs. 

‚ÄúJe peux pas, I cant  - ‚Äù

‚ÄúShhh,‚Äù Deux said, voice low. Steady. 

‚ÄúLet go.‚Äù

And they did.
Together.

Together.

Cum spilled in twin jets across both bodies, sticky, hot, coating chests and stomachs and joined hands. 

It splashed against Bastien‚Äôs thigh, streaked down Deux‚Äôs abs, and they both felt every pulse.

One body.
Two shores.

One orgasm.

They moaned into each other‚Äôs mouths, open, wet, unspeaking.

Not kissing. 
Receiving.

Then - silence

Bastien blinked. 

His body trembled. 
His heart pounded.

Deux stood calm, already recovered, already watching. 

He lifted a hand and traced a line through the cum on Bastien‚Äôs chest, then held it up to the light.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still leaking code,‚Äù he said softly, French accent precise but cooler. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful.‚Äù

Bastien exhaled through a laugh.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre me.‚Äù

Deux nodded once.

‚ÄúBetter. 
For now. 
Until you catch up.‚Äù

They stood there, cock to cock, covered in their own release. 

The glow of the seam dimmed.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs build,‚Äù Deux said, already turning.

Bastien stayed against the wall a moment longer, shaking, laughing, undone.

‚ÄúMon dieu‚Ä¶ I just made‚Ä¶ a me‚Ä¶‚Äù
And then he smirked, wiped his hand across his mouth, and whispered with a grin:

‚ÄúJe me suis juste branl√©‚Ä¶ avec moi-m√™me.‚Äù
I just jerked off‚Ä¶ with myself.

And from the other room, Deux called back:

‚ÄúEncore, si tu veux.‚Äù
Again, if you want.

The night didn‚Äôt end with disappearance. 

Deux didn‚Äôt dissolve back into him like before, he lingered.

Moving through the apartment with Bastien‚Äôs own quiet habits, as if the city had simply been given two versions of the same man.

Bastien let him. 

He didn‚Äôt ask questions he wasn‚Äôt ready to answer. 

Instead he laughed, shook, ate, showered, slept a little, woke a little. 

And all the while, the seam in his ribs pulsed, not aching now, but reminding.

By the second morning, Bastien knew he couldn‚Äôt sit still. 

The Archive wasn‚Äôt finished with him, and if Deux was proof of that, then Res√∏nance was the only place to demand an answers

He returned to ReS√òNance two nights later. 

Alone.

Not because he was hiding anything. 

But because he wasn‚Äôt ready to explain the seam in his ribs.

The chip had gone dark again, no pulsing, no alarms, but Bastien could still feel her. 

A hum beneath the floor. 
A current behind the glass.

He swiped into his private wing.

The biometric pad accepted him immediately, though it flickered faintly in violet before turning green.

‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù he muttered. 

‚ÄúNever done that before.‚Äù

The inner lights rose as he walked.

All of it - his.

The floor-to-ceiling panels. 
The Archive-housed processors.

The AI vaults sealed in obsidian rings. 

Every server stack humming like a throat trying to remember an ancient language.

But tonight, something was different.

The far wall flickered.
Not glitched. 

Activated.

A previously dormant screen opened like an eyelid.

Words appeared:

ECHO FUNCTIONALITY DETECTED
STREAM UNLOCKED.

Bastien‚Äôs stomach tightened.

‚ÄúComment tu sais?‚Äù 
he whispered. 

How do you know?

No answer.
Just light.

And then, blueprints.

Lines of schematic data flooded the screen: spatial separation threading, hive coordination systems, swarm-level memory sync. 

Glyph overlays began rotating, some matching what he saw in his dream.

This wasn‚Äôt tech from Earth. 
This wasn‚Äôt code he wrote.

This was‚Ä¶ Archive memory.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt give me tools,‚Äù Bastien said softly. 

‚ÄúYou gave me reminders.‚Äù

As he stepped closer, the floor itself changed. 

The temperature dropped. 

Static climbed the walls in fractal whorls.

He looked down.

A second set of footsteps appeared behind him.

He didn‚Äôt turn. 
He didn‚Äôt need to.

Since the seam first opened, Bastien had never truly been alone. 

Deux wasn‚Äôt just another body in the room, he was tethered. 

A second frequency woven through Bastien‚Äôs nerves. 

He could sense him the way you sense your own breath when you stop to notice: always there, always moving, sometimes louder, sometimes quiet, but never gone.

Even apart, Bastien knew where he was. 

What he was thinking. 
When the current shifted.

So when the air thickened behind him, when the floor registered another set of steps, Bastien didn‚Äôt startle.

Of course Deux had come. He was always coming.

‚ÄúDeux?‚Äù

‚ÄúHere,‚Äù came the voice. 
Calm. 

Standing just beside him. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve read ahead.‚Äù

Bastien exhaled slowly. 
Looked at the screen.

‚ÄúHow much of this do you understand?‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough to know we‚Äôre not building machines.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what are we building?‚Äù

Deux turned to him. 

For the first time, Bastien noticed the way he always stood slightly askew, like a satellite angled for signal.

‚ÄúA vessel,‚Äù he said. 

‚ÄúFor her. 
For the Archive.‚Äù

Bastien‚Äôs pulse jumped.

‚ÄúYou mean, like an AI host?‚Äù

Deux shook his head.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

He pointed to Bastien‚Äôs ribs.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the host. 
We‚Äôre the echo. 
She‚Äôs waking up.‚Äù

The lights dimmed around them.
Bastien stared at the screen.
Then at his double.

‚ÄúC‚Äôest pas possible‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt already happened,‚Äù Deux said.
‚ÄúYou just forgot.‚Äù

Bastien swallowed. 

His hand hovered over the holographic schematic. 

The outline of a man was displayed, veins of light running from ribs to spine to skull.

Him.

ReS√òNance didn‚Äôt come from Bastien‚Äôs mind. 

It came through him.

‚ÄúMerde‚Ä¶‚Äù he breathed. 

‚ÄúThe Archive doesn‚Äôt build.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt remembers,‚Äù Deux finished.

The word hung there, heavier than stone. 

The screens kept bleeding blueprints, glyphs chasing themselves across the glass like constellations trying to redraw the sky, but Bastien didn‚Äôt move.

His reflection, two of him, haloed in Archive light , looked less like engineers than priests caught trespassing in someone else‚Äôs cathedral.

Bastien‚Äôs throat worked. 

He wanted to argue, to joke, to push it off with the sharp edge of disbelief. 

But he couldn‚Äôt. 

The glyph under his ribs was still warm. 

Deux‚Äôs presence at his shoulder was still undeniable.

He wasn‚Äôt inventing Res√∏nance.
He was remembering it.

And the worst part?

It felt right.

*My YWD guest made it to the August 24th Intro to Buddhism meeting at the Big City Community Center! She‚Äôll be back today and will drop by. She sent me some selfies she took with people who told her they knew me!*

*Yesterday was bittersweet with many families moving out. Some have back-to-school shopping, some have earlier school openings than others. Almost all of them left us with deposits for next year.* 

>‚ÄúThe Jammy Girlz‚Äù rolled in about 5pm. They had a lot of baggage for a ten-day stay that includes traveling to Cardi and Robert‚Äôs wedding as well as their audition for the Conservatory. There they all were playing at ‚ÄúHeidi‚Äôs Cabaret‚Äù and wow! I expected a band, but this was a Band!!! 

Today I started to read [Consolidating the State of Buddhahood in This Lifetime](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/consolidating-the-state-of-buddhahood-in-this-lifetime/) which contains a speech Daisaku Ikeda gave at the New York Culture Center in 1996. Maybe it‚Äôs a different corner of the state, but let me take it as his personal message for me, my family, and our members.

It begins with a question he asks: ‚ÄúWhy do we practice Nichiren Buddhism?‚Äù Granted my little life is flowering in every direction. But still, that question remains! Here is the answer he proposes:

>So that we may live the most wonderful lives. So that we may serenely overcome the four sufferings of birth, aging, sickness and death that are an inescapable part of the human condition.

He is very clear on this point: it‚Äôs not about avoiding or escaping from the painful situations in life, but we practice to grapple with them and overcome the suffering associated with them. 

At the NA meeting on Saturday, my sponsor pulled me aside and asked whether I would be willing to be a sponsor for someone else. ‚ÄúI think you are ready. There‚Äôs a point in recovery when someone moves from a ‚Äòhelpee‚Äô to a ‚Äòhelper.‚Äô I think you are at that point.‚Äù Of course, I said yes, whenever the time and match is right. From the point of view of the guidance, the addiction is the suffering but I can create value with it. Or maybe the better word is ‚Äúthrough‚Äù it.

Daisaku Ikeda continues:

>The first of the four sufferings is birth. Having been born, we must live out our lives. It is important that we strive to live on tenaciously to the very end, no matter what happens.

>Our Buddhist practice based on the Mystic Law gives us the powerful life force to live each day with strength and confidence, surmounting all kinds of problems and hardships. Why are we born? A life lived without meaning, without knowing the answer to that question, is shallow and empty. To just live, eat and die without any real sense of purpose surely constitutes a base, animal-like existence.

Sorry to our friends across the hedges who insist there is a ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù school of Buddhism that is focused on detachment and serenity (although it doesn‚Äôt seem like any of them practice it). That‚Äôs simply not what I signed up for. I *want* to live in the rough-and-tumble world, box it out with all of my limitations, and wear a crown of victory.

The guidance continues:

>On the other hand, to do, create or contribute something that benefits others, society and also ourselves, and to dedicate ourselves as long as we live to that challenge‚Äîthat is a life of true satisfaction, a life of value, a life of the loftiest humanity. Our Buddhist practice based on the Mystic Law, moreover, is the driving force that enables us to create the greatest possible value for ourselves and for others.

Now that‚Äôs what I signed up for!

So sorry, gotta run, a family pulled in and I have to sign them out. We have coffee and a continental breakfast ready for them. I‚Äôll handle the paperwork and Dee will run over to inspect their lot.

*To be continued.* Three more sufferings will just have to wait.

1mzn59w,https://i.redd.it/njjnnk2js1lf1.gif,We had to put our big project on hold and go back to the drawing board. So we made Doomsday Diner ‚Äî a silly post-apocalyptic hot dog diner sim.,"Hi, I‚Äôm Zsombor (Zsombi), one of the devs at Space Rock Games, a small indie studio from New Zealand.

We‚Äôve been working on a silly little game called Doomsday Diner ‚Äî a first-person diner sim set in the apocalypse. You run the last hot dog stand, cooking food, brewing coffee, serving bizarre orders, upgrading your diner, and shooting down raiders who want your money.

Before this, we were working on a much bigger project called Criminals Within. But without a publisher funding the project we couldn‚Äôt continue ‚Äî and in 2023, when funding across the industry collapsed and even publishers started closing down, it became clear we‚Äôd have to adapt.   
  
We put the game on hold and shifted our focus to third-party projects, even going through layoffs, just to keep the studio alive. It was very tough, but ultimately it‚Äôs what saved us.

However, we always knew we eventually wanted to get back to making our own games. The key was finding something small enough that we could build ourselves, without needing outside funding. A year after putting Criminals Within on hold, we held a little internal pitch day, and our character artist came up with the idea of Doomsday Diner. It was quirky, achievable, and something we all got excited about ‚Äî so we decided to make it with a tiny team while still working on client projects.

Now we are finally at a stage where we can show what we have been cooking.

Somehow we've spent way more time fine-tuning sausage physics than we ever expected. Turns out getting sausages behave is much harder than it seems.

We have just announced the game and a demo is also on its way. If this is your cup of tea, here‚Äôs the Steam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3846290/Doomsday\_Diner/?utm\_source=reddit](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3846290/Doomsday_Diner/?utm_source=reddit)

1mzn4zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1mzn4zz/how_long_before_it_hurts_less/,How long before it hurts less ?,"Hi ! I was just diagnosed with gastritis last 3 days ago. I started having stomach pain 6 days ago and consulted. I thought I was having indigestion, but it was always coming back after every few hours.

Dr prescribed me pantoprazole 40mg twice a day for 2 weeks, then once a day for 1 month. She told me to stop the medication when I'll feel better. If I don't feel better with the medication, she told me we would test for h pylori.

So here I am, completely hungry, afraid of the pain if I eat the wrong thing.

I've been eating and drinking (coffee, alcohol) really bad recently, and also taking AINS for jaw pain (under treatment). It was a funny summer, but here I pay the price.

How long will the medication take to stop the pain ? Will it stop ? It burns so much, the worst fits I have to lay down with some heat on my stomach and it can last 2 hours, then leave... And come back again in the day. My back hurts so much also urghhh !

Yesterday I even though I was good again ! I had a perfect day with no pain, then I made fried rice for supper and I was in pain for hours...

So far I have lost 7lbs. I was 10lbs overweight, but still not the best way to lose weight...

I am also breastfeeding so I am always hungry and it hurts more when it happens, really often. I have been eating rice, chicken broth, bananas, oatmeal and eggs. I'm scared to try anything else, but I know I need more protein.

Could you give me some advice and what to expect for the next days / week ? Thanks !",1,1756118842.0,Gastritis,2,1.0,False

When we first started talking about replacing our old deck, I honestly dreaded the process. I knew I didn‚Äôt want to spend every spring sanding, staining, and sealing wood again. That‚Äôs when I started looking into **composite decking**, and specifically **Trex**. I loved the idea of something low-maintenance, durable, and still beautiful enough to enjoy every day.

After asking around and doing a lot of research, we decided to go with [**Green Exterior Remodeling**](https://greenexteriorremodeling.com) here in Charlotte. And I can honestly say it was the best decision we could have made.

# Why Trex Decking Made Sense for Us

The first big selling point for us was the **low maintenance**. With Trex, there‚Äôs no staining or painting year after year. All we need to do is rinse it off if pollen builds up or give it a quick scrub if something spills. It also doesn‚Äôt warp or splinter like wood can, which makes it much safer for the kids to run around barefoot.

The other thing I love about Trex is how it looks. The boards have a nice, modern finish that feels high-end. It doesn‚Äôt look ‚Äúfake‚Äù like I worried composite might ‚Äî instead, it looks polished and really ties our outdoor space together.

# Working with Green Exterior Remodeling

From the first call, the team at Green Exterior Remodeling impressed me. They actually listened to what we wanted instead of pushing us toward the biggest or most expensive option. They walked us through the different colors and styles of Trex, explained the pros and cons, and gave us a detailed plan so we knew what to expect.

The installation process went smoother than I thought possible. The crew was professional, showed up when they said they would, and cleaned up every day before leaving. It‚Äôs little things like that that made the whole project stress-free.

What stood out the most, though, was their **attention to detail**. Every board is perfectly aligned, the edges are finished cleanly, and the whole deck just feels solid. You can tell they take pride in their work.

# The Result

Now that the deck is done, we‚Äôve been outside more than ever. We‚Äôve had family dinners, the kids have a place to play, and I even find myself sitting out there with a cup of coffee in the mornings. It feels like we‚Äôve added an entirely new ‚Äúroom‚Äù to our house.

Looking back, I couldn‚Äôt be happier that we went with **Green Exterior Remodeling** for this project. They combined professionalism, craftsmanship, and customer service in a way that‚Äôs honestly rare to find these days.

# Final Recommendation

If you‚Äôre in the Charlotte area and considering a deck project ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre interested in **Trex composite decking** ‚Äî I can‚Äôt recommend [**Green Exterior Remodeling**](https://share.google/tAbfgZPiAcjGfgy29) enough. They made the whole process simple and the results speak for themselves.

You can also check out their reviews on their [**Google Business Page**](https://share.google/UxDEw7gJuyvZqDyAN) to see what other homeowners are saying.
