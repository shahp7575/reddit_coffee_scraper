The type of dark that makes you hold your hand in front of your face to make sure you can still see. The only light that graced the land was the pale, cloud-curtained rays of a waning crescent moon. Within the still of the night a garden rests. Plump vegetation is cooled by a light sprinkle on a summer breeze. The garden sits in the middle of a sea of cool grass with an island of a trailer home to its side, and a mountain range of trees that tower above surrounding the humble hollow. While the rain falls and the breeze blows the chorus of the night joins in and adds their tune to the symphony. Frogs bellow a deep croak, crickets slide their legs on a nature-made violin, and cicadas creak their guttural moans. Out of the thicket of trees a figure emerges. Blessed by the camouflage of the night, the figure approaches the garden and peers at the plump vegetation. From within the figure a hiss arises and spreads itself over the harvest, devouring every section of the greenery. The moon stares at the crime below, bearing witness to the sins of the Earth in Copper Creek. 

  


It was a Tuesday. Rain poured outside a small strip outlet housing a Mexican restaurant named La Granja, a financial firm named Franklin and Sons, and a private eye business named Williams’ Investigations. Within the building, Darren Williams sits at the reception desk as a car pulls into the lot.

“Another day of nothing going on in this dead-end town. I have to find somewhere else,” Darren thought to himself as he aimlessly scrolled his phone. “I love Richie, but this place is making no money.” Deep within his own thoughts, he doesn’t hear the door open and shut, and he doesn’t hear the old woman clear her throat the first or the second time.

“Hey! I’m looking for the detective.” A short old woman stood opposite, peering at him with slanted, burning brown eyes magnified by her prescription glasses. A fiery expression planted on her face.

“Good afternoon, ma’am,” he squeaked out, poorly hiding how much he was startled. “Yeah. My brother is the PI. He’s in the back if you’d like me to get him.”

“Yes. Please. And be quick about it.” 

Darren stood and began down the hallway to collect his brother. The office space was deceptively large, although that was probably thanks to a long hallway that joined the reception area with the sitting room on one side and the restroom on the other, leading to a lonely office at the end of the hall with a door that read “Richie Williams: Private Investigator.” The door was cracked open slightly, giving Darren just a peek into Richie’s workspace and allowing Richie’s busy humming to escape out of the room. Darren delivered a light knock to the door and opened it.

“Just grab me something for me if you’re going out for lunch, Darren. I’m still trying to nail down where Ms. Weaver’s dog could have run off to for the third time this month,” said Richie, scribbling on a topography map of Copper Creek.

Darren stood in the doorframe, catching a full look at Richie’s workspace. Cluttered would be an understatement. “No. There’s a potential client waiting at the desk.” At the word “client,” Richie’s head shot straight up, nearly flinging his round glasses off of his head. Without even saying a word, he made eye contact with his brother, his blue eyes widening, and stood so fast papers fell from his desk to the carpet. In one motion he grabbed a pen and pad and strode out of the room past Darren. 

“Hello, ma’am, please right this way,” Richie said, widely motioning to the sitting room like he’s presenting something on a game show. It really has been a slow few months for the private eye. Darren followed them into the room, which was lit with warm lamps and had a table with three chairs. Kind of like if a police interrogation room were a therapist’s office. 

“Now my name is Richie, ma’am, and this is my brother Darren. What’s your name, and how can we help?” Richie was so eager to get her statement he nearly leaned over the table to make eye contact with the woman.

“Macy Washburn,” the woman said with a gruff Southern accent fermented by years of smoking, “and I need you to prove that my neighbor poisoned my garden.” Ms. Washburn said with disdain, her eyes still as piercing as ever, not being helped by the large glasses.

“Okay, Ms. Washburn. Why do you believe it was your neighbor who did that, and what is his name?” 

“Joe Walsh—can I smoke in here?”

“Well, ma’am, I’d rather you not—” Richie couldn’t get out his sentence before Ms. Washburn had already lit a dart and taken a big puff.

“Joe Walsh is a sad, jealous little man who is upset because I just got a better deal distributing at the farmer’s market than him. So when I woke up yesterday morning to find all my crops rotted out with little holes in them, I walked over to his garden with a shovel to do some justice, and I was only halfway through the cucumbers before the little shit called the cops. They gave me a warning to not go near his house again, but I tried to tell them what he had done, but they just chalked it up to beetles in my garden. So here I am.” At the conclusion of her story, Ms. Washburn let out a long sigh. 

“And what would you like us to do, ma’am?” Darren asked as Richie was preoccupied, still feverishly writing notes on his notepad.

“I want you to deliver me some damn justice!” Ms. Washburn said, slamming her hand on the table with surprising force for such a small frame. She glared at Darren with a merciless gaze.

“Yes, ma’am, of course,” Richie said cautiously. “Now, were all your crops destroyed, or are there some left?”

Ms. Washburn relaxed back into her chair and took another drag of her cigarette. “He didn’t get my squash thankfully, so there’s that.” 

“Perfect. Well, Ms. Washburn, the next step would be for us to investigate the scene, so could we follow you back to your garden?” Richie said, giving his pen and pad a much-deserved break. “Also there is the discussion of payment. We usually charge a flat fee of—.”

“I got fifty dollars,” said Ms. Washburn, pulling a crumpled bill out of her purse and tossing it onto the table. “Now come on, boys!” Ms. Washburn got up and headed towards the door. The brothers exchanged a glance with each other before getting up and following the old woman outside. 

  
  


The drive was short enough. The rain had stopped, so now it was just a humid, sticky evening with the sun battling through stretched cotton clouds. Ms. Washburn drove like a maniac. Her 1990s Cadillac was barely holding traction with the slick road as she treated the speed limit as a suggestion. Darren and Richie attempted to keep pace in Darren’s 2005 Corolla. “You think this Walsh guy did it?” Darren asked Richie, who was reading back through Ms. Washburn’s statement. 

“I think that our client is a quick-to-temper older woman that doesn’t like getting her things touched by man or beetle. The police officers already looked into this, and I think that there is credence to their beetle theory, but I also know how competitive the farming scene is here.”

“I think she’s a little crazy.” Darren spat out, cutting Richie off slightly, all while wearing a slight grin.

“It’s not proper investigatory work to just chalk up your clients to being crazy, Darren. Look at the worst; there are tons of beetles back there, and we got fifty bucks.” Richie slid back at his brother. His analytical tone brought him down to Earth.

Darren glanced over to his brother with a hint of worry in his eyes. 

“And how long will that keep the lights on for, Rich?”

“Let’s not do this now, Darren—TURN!” The moment Darren looked at Richie, Ms. Washburn took a hairpin turn down a dirt road, which, thanks to the rain, had now slung a wave of brown mud onto the front of Darren’s black car. “Jesus, lady!” Darren yelled, looking to keep up with the old woman. He did what could be described as a drift and followed the Cadillac down the road that split into two driveways, both leading to two similarly styled trailer homes separated by a large row of trees and greenery. Ms. Washburn led the boys down the left side. Both homes sat in a pocket of the forest about a half mile off the main road. The trees were of dizzying height as their green was electrified by the contrast of the gray sky. The brothers parked behind the old Cadillac and stepped out into knee-high grass which to Ms. Washburn, stood up to her waist. “I’m surprised you boys kept up with little old me,” she let out a slight chuckle.

“And I’m surprised we’re all alive,” Darren said with a smirk. Richie shot him a glare, telling him to button up. 

“Nice place, Ms. Washburn. Would you mind showing us to the garden?” Richie asked, already using a handkerchief to wipe a bead of sweat off his brow from the increasing humidity. Ms. Washburn nodded and motioned for us to follow her around to the back of the trailer. Once we turned the corner, they were greeted with a similarly trimmed backyard but an immaculate quartet of garden boxes. Two of the box’s contents were mangled and broken. Watermelons sat flattened like pumpkins after Halloween, tomatoes barely hung to limp vines with holes the size of quarters bored through them, and empty vines where peppers used to hang stood lonely against their gardening cage. “See, I told you’. Downright poisoned my prize-winning melons.” Said Ms. Washburn, putting a cigarette out with her foot before reaching into her shirt pocket to find another. The brothers approached the boxes to examine the destroyed plants. “They certainly are dead.” Richie said, moving one of the vines with the end of his pen. 

“And Mr. Walsh. You said he was your neighbor. I assume he lives in that trailer right there?” Richie motioned to the trailer, which now sat on their right. 

“That’s right. That ugly little thing is bringing down my whole property value!” Richie and Darren exchange a sarcastic glance. 

“If Mr. Walsh wanted to get to these plants, then he either had to walk up his own driveway and then down hers or go through that thicket in the dead of night.” Darren suggested to Richie trying to bring some reason to the conversation. “Are you sure you’ve never had beetle problems before, Ms. Washburn?”

“Nope, never. You can check for yourself here.” At that she picked up a clump of dirt and shook it in Darren’s face, obviously irritated at his statement. “Besides. I lightly sprayed around with insecticide.” She motions to a large container of insecticide with a large wand attachment under her porch. 

“No, no. That’s not necessary, ma’am.” Richie said, placing his hand on Ms. Washburn’s arm to lower it. “He’s just covering our bases. We have to ask these types of questions for the sake of being thorough.” The old woman lowered her arm away but still shot him a piercing glare. “So now I guess what’d be next is to take some of the vegetation in for testing. Then we can know if it is truly a chemical or beetles. Because I don’t see any insects around here.” Richie said, picking up a tomato and a sample of dirt and putting them into separate evidence bags. “I can get these sent off for testing to see if they have any chemicals attached to them.”

“And how long is all that going to take?” Ms. Washburn quickly shot at Richie.

“She’s got a point, Rich. What if this Walsh guy is up to something? He’ll be back to finish off the whole crop. It would take days to get a lab result, or we could catch the guy red-handed,” Darren said to his brother in a slight whisper, trying to create the slightest bit of mischief to alleviate his boredom. 

“We have no surveillance equipment, Darren.”

“Uh, yeah, we do.” Darren then with one hand pointed to his eyes and in the other took out his cell phone. “Come on, man, it’s fieldwork. It’ll get you out of the office for the night, and it’s something to take your mind off that damn missing dog. Plus if we do catch him doing something, it’s open and shut.” 



Richie paused for a moment. Running through the scenario in his mind. “I guess. I’m still going to run these to the lab to have them analyzed, but I think a stakeout can work.” Darren silently celebrated the fact of getting a stakeout and the possibility of tackling an old man. Richie explained the plan to Ms. Washburn, who also seemed excited at the prospect of Joe Walsh getting tackled. They both headed back to town, where Richie sent the samples to the lab and agreed that 9:00 pm would be the best time to head back over, seeing as though that’s when the sun began to set. As the day waned, they went back to the office for the final preparations. 



“Alright, so we’ll need our night vision goggles, some handcuffs, and for food I’m thinking burritos from next door—” Darren carried on before being stopped.

“Hey. This is an investigation. We are going to observe and report. We can’t be making citizen’s arrests. Especially after the hot water we got into with the cops last time.” Richie quickly said, bringing Darren back down to Earth. 

“Okay, they have to get over that. Mr. Devalo was sneaking into his own house through the upstairs window. Mrs. Devalo said to figure out who was breaking into her house, so we had every right to put him in cuffs. Besides, what better way to wipe our name clean than to bring an actual guy to justice?” 

“We just have to tiptoe a little here, Darren. Those cops will be looking for every reason to run us out of town. You know how hard it’ll be to set up again? They don’t take kindly to outsiders around here.”

“Rich. That’s a cliche. Whatever happened to southern hospitality?” Darren said, raising his voice to create a bit of levity. 

“Besides, it’s not like we’re from New York. We’re Georgians; we’re all basically related...you know what? Scratch that.” Darren paused before starting again. “Rich, you’re smart and capable of running this show, and I know that. You’re the boss. I’m just here to tackle and slap cuffs on old creepy guys apparently,” Darren said with a laugh.

“Alright. I’ll get the goggles charged up. You go over and grab the food. And if you see Felina, let her know I said “hi,” okay?”

“You sly dog. I got you, brother.” Darren disappeared out the door and walked a few yards to La Granja. Richie returned to his office, preparing for the job ahead.  


It was dark. Not pitch black, but enough that you would need to blink a few times to adjust your eyes. The boys sat in the Corolla underneath an overcast sky with the moon’s rays fighting to break through. Darren sat in the driver’s seat, turning the radio knob, trying to find the local station. Richie adjusted a small tripod with his phone camera pointed at Ms. Washburn’s garden. The cacophony of forest animals and insects creates a blanket of sound around the brothers, enveloping them and trapping them within the world of their own making.

“You know, I’m sure Felina would go out with you if you asked, Rich. She seems like a nice enough girl.” Darren said to his brother with a mouthful of shrimp burrito.

“Yeah, yeah. I’m just focusing on my stuff right now. I don’t think I could fit her into my schedule.”

“Of what? Finding dogs and runaway teenagers? Come on, man, take a leap. He'll take up a shift at the restaurant. We’d be happy to have you.” 

“I don’t know, man. I don’t know if I want to jump that headfirst...but the extra money wouldn’t hurt.”

“That’s the spirit.” Darren finally quits his fidgeting with the radio. “Finally. Damn knob is so particular sometimes.”

A smooth voice breaks through the static and introduces himself as Nicky Jarvis, the host of the local late radio show Night Tracks. 

“I hope you’re all having a quiet and easy evening. It looks like we’re waving bye-bye to the rain as it moves away tonight, with the sun coming back to say hello tomorrow. We’re going to keep it rolling on our show with a classic from 1994. Here is 

D-LOW with Call Me Your Baby on Night Tracks. The time is 10:15. Jarvis’s voice fades out as the opening bass of Call Me Your Baby begins to play.

“Where are you? I want to see your face,” Darren softly sings, beginning to put on the night vision goggles.

“In the moonlight. We can go your pace,” Richie joins in, finishing the lyric. 

“I want to call you mine, and that’s all the time,” Darren continues, getting more into the music. 

“So won’t you be my baby?” Richie adds in.

The two brothers together softly sing, “Call me when you need a man, because, baby, you don’t understand. I need you to call me your baby!”   


While the two sing and finish their food, they’re muffled by the song of the night that surrounds them. The clouds once covering the sky move at a rapid pace, revealing the hungry moon, which casts its beams to feast on the rain-soaked ground. A new air has filled the hollow as a figure emerges from the thicket bordering Ms. Washburn’s and Mr. Walsh’s properties. Under the moon’s harsh rays, the figure looks to take another toll on the garden that lies before it. The figure acts once again, this time under the full spotlight of the moon. 

“So don’t let me go. Hold me so, so close. Let me be your baby.” Darren, lost in the music, is cut off suddenly by his brother.

“Shut up,” Richie says in an imperative whisper. “Darren, look at there.” Darren glances up, the night goggles still on his face, and spots the figure slowly moving towards the garden. “Oh, you are so busted, old man Walsh. Rich, are you getting this on camera?” Darren asked slowly, taking the goggles off his face. 

“I’m getting something. You can’t really tell. I think we’re going to have to get closer.” The two share a nod in agreement and slowly exit their vehicle without closing the doors in an attempt at complete silence. The brothers under the moonlight move from the side of the figure. The tall grass aided in their stealth. Richie came to a stop about fifteen feet from the garden, instructing Darren to do the same. “I got a good video here. He’s fully exposed...but he’s—” Suddenly a hiss breaks through the otherwise deafening night symphony. 

“He’s spraying the poison on the rest,” Darren said, narrowing his eyes. “Go time.” In a flash Darren sprinted at the figure, covering the yardage like a running back. 

“Darren, wait!” But it was too late; Darren was already airborne, leaping at the figure for a takedown. Darren extended his arms in attack, but instead of colliding with what he thought to be Mr. Walsh, Darren cascaded through the figure, landing harshly on the earth. Bewildered, Darren stares up at the figure, suddenly an imposing tower of shadow above him. “What the hell?” The night symphony, which had been a well-composed joining of the night life, then turned into an overpowering swell of cicadas screamed in anger. The figure, which had once moved at a lumbering pace, now moved like an angry tornado at Darren and cocooned him. “Darren!” Richie sprinted after his brother, disregarding the rising cry of the night. Reaching his brother, Richie outstretched a hand, pulling Darren to his feet. The brother was only able to muster one word: “Car.” The two dashed through the night towards the vehicle, but keeping pace with them was the angered swarm of hungry insects. The car was the safe haven the boys needed as they leapt in and slammed the doors while the windows were pounded with the thousands of insect feet.

“Was that? Is that? What the hell?” Darren screamed, still picking cicadas off his person and squashing them in the floorboard.

“Bugs. Thousands of bugs."" Richie added, still reeling from the escape.

“I hate these things.” Darren disgustingly shakes himself, trying to get the feeling of the large dirty insects crawling on him. 

“So we know the cause of the problem. Now we must make a solution.” Richie looked through the footage on his phone, upping the brightness, trying to learn more about their foe.

“You can’t arrest bugs, Rich.”

“No. But you can kill them. Look.” Richie leans over to show Darren footage from earlier that night. “You can see them coming out of the thicket between Ms. Washburn’s and Mr. Walsh’s. They must be where the nest is.”

“There’s a lot of nonsense in there. How the hell do you suppose we find a little old nest?” 

“Big bugs. Big nest. It’s a theory, Darren. Or we could sit here all night with them pelting the glass.” Darren is brought back to the reality of their car being surrounded and attacked by the bugs. “Okay. What’s the plan?”

“You still have that bug spray?” 

“Maybe,” Darren leans into the back seat and comes back up holding a can. “I don’t see how this helps us now. They’re outside the nest. Don’t they need to be inside?”

“Damn.” Richie pauses for a moment, thinking up the next part of the plan. “Wait, Ms. Washburn’s insecticide. It’s under her back porch. That’s enough chemical to take down a colony. If you go for the porch—”

“I still don’t see how this works. How am I supposed to spray them all—”

“Darren, we have to try something here.” Richie sent Darren a pleading glare.

“Fine. Ready? Go!” At that, the brothers in sync stepped out of their vehicle and were immediately swarmed by the black cloud of bugs. Richie, wasting no time, sprinted towards the thicket to find the nest. Meanwhile, Richie ran the few yards to the back porch, diving under it and grabbing the insecticide sprayer while still being oppressed by the thousands of legs that marched on his body, trying to find a still space to nest. Quickly Darren delivers two pumps to the container, waking up the wand for another round of spraying. “I hope this works, Rich.” Darren squeezes the wand, and a puff of chemical mist meets with the accosting force of the cicadas.



Richie ran faster than he thought he could, still being trailed by a sector of the bug army, but he was able to keep a pace in front of them for a time. As he got closer to the thicket, a sudden wave of death came over him. The scent of decay occupied the air around him, but he still entered the thicket with a head of steam, now fighting off the battalion of insects sent after him, but he still searched for their nest. With his cell phone in one hand casting a light and the can of bug spray in his other, the private eye soldier moved clumsily through the outstretched vines and branches, searching for the source of the attack by following the smell of rotting flesh. About two yards into the thicket, Richie found the nest. Sitting against the base of the tree was a man dressed in the remains of a suit. His eyes are a pair of black abysses staring into an endless dream. On his forehead an odd symbol had been carved. It resembled a crescent moon with a pair of wings on either side of it. 

Richie stood motionless. Horrified by the gruesome scene when the reality crashed back in on him in the form of the furious swarm of cicadas. Blinded for a moment, Richie swung his arm to clear a path as we trudged towards the nest and unleashed the can’s contents on what used to be a man, coating his once healthy flesh with a killer compound. At the spraying of the body, the wail of the cicadas’ song reached a fever pitch, and the onslaught of legs and wings increased on Richie. He could feel a million legs crawling on his hands, his neck, and into his ears and nose. Richie fell into the fetal position in an attempt to protect himself from the attack, dropping the can and his phone, the light shining like a last beacon of hope. 



The spray did little to quell the bugs, but it gave Darren enough separation to shake the crawling menaces off his person. “These things aren’t going to die from this.” Darren’s inner gears began to turn, devising a plan when the noise of the invaders became loud enough to wake the dead. Darren looked up as the cicadas converged on one another, creating a cloud of wrath that quickly shot towards the thicket and his brother. “The nest. They’re protecting the nest.” Grabbing the insecticide, he gathered himself and sprinted towards the nest. He entered the thicket, trampling over the foliage and falling multiple times. “Rich! Richie, where are you?!” Darren searched for his brother, combing the scenery with his eyes, coming across a pinpoint of light through the trees, and moving towards it.  The sight of his brother wrapped in the cold embrace of insects nearly sent Darren to his knees, but the brother moved to his side, shaking the bugs off of him, drawing some of the ire of their attack. Richie looked up to his savior only to pass out a single word: “Nest.” Darren’s head snapped up to find the carcass that lay in front of him. Cicadas are already crawling within his skull, looking to salvage their eggs. At the realization, Darren twisted the nozzle off of the container, dousing the body in the killer compound. The cicada force stopped all at once as the symbol on the nest’s head began to emit a sickly yellow glow. Richie climbed to his feet and watched the scene with his brother. The cicadas around them entered the body in a feverish passion, but it was for naught. The chemical had done its job. The yellow glow ceased, and the cicadas still in the air dropped to the ground. 

Frogs bellowed a deep croak as crickets played on nature-made violins as the night resettled itself, no longer sharing their symphony with the insect invaders. “So. It was bugs.” Darren broke the silence between the brothers. They exchanged a wide-eyed glance and began to exit the thicket. “We have to call this in to the sheriff.” Richie said, still dusting off his phone from the forest bed. The two made their way to the car as Richie sat on the phone with someone from the sheriff’s office. “They said they couldn’t make it until morning.” 

“Did you tell them there’s a damn dead body in there?”

“I did, and they said they couldn’t get a proper forensic team out until six o’clock.”

Darren checks his watch. “Well, I think we deserve some rest until then. Let’s head back to the house.” 

Richie nods in agreement as the two climb back into their car and reverse down the old dirt driveway. The two trailers sat in peace, serenaded by the song of the night. The moon’s beams followed the Corolla as they departed the scene of their late-night attack. Through the silence of their car, Darren turns a knob, and a familiar low tune breaks through. “Hey babies. It’s getting late even for Night Tracks, so as we close out this evening, I hope you all enjoyed our show, and I hope you sleep tight and don’t let the bed bugs bite. The time is 11:00 pm.” As Jarvis’ voice fades out, the opening chords of Bad Moon Rising play over the radio. The Corolla speeds through the night. A lonely bullet accompanied by a pale observer in the sky, as the moon does for all the people of Copper Creek. 

  
  
  
  


Epilogue

  
  


Darren and Richie turned down the familiar dirt road to Ms. Washburn’s house, where the sheriff’s office had already beaten them to the scene. Two squad cars, a CSU van, and an out-of-place SUV sat in the driveway. Ms. Washburn stood on her front porch smoking a cigarette, and at the sight of the Williams brothers, she marched off her porch directly towards the slowing car and to the driver-side window. Darren rolled down his window to greet the old woman. 

“Good morning, Ms. Washburn, how—”

“Why the hell are the police here with all the fancy equipment? What did you two boys do last night?” Richie climbed out of the car and looked to answer her questions without alerting her to the complete events of last night. “Ms. Washburn, we solved your case last night. It wasn’t Mr. Walsh or beetles. It was cicadas. They were eating away at your garden, and they had themselves a nest in a dead body back in that thicket. So that’s why the police are here.”

“A body?” A sudden flash of empathy entered Ms. Washburn’s face. “My goodness. Do they know who it was?”

“Not sure. We just got here, but we’re going to see what we can find out.” Darren added, getting out of the car.

Ms. Washburn gave the boys a nod as they strode past her to the scene. While approaching through the tall grass a portly gentleman walked from the edge of the thicket to them, meeting in the middle of the open field. 

“Why are you two boys such a pain in my side?” The sheriff stood looking up at them, his round physique not helped by his stature. A pair of black eyes squinted at them from under a wide-brimmed hat, and a gray mustache that had been stained with morning coffee twitched with irritation. 

“I didn’t realize making you do your job was a pain, Sheriff,” Darren shot out, getting a burning stare from the sheriff. 

“Darren! Sorry about that, Sheriff Oscar; we just thought you’d like to know about the body in the woods.” Richie tried to diffuse the situation with calm words. At that the sheriff let down his guard and raised his eyebrows.

“Yeah, well, we still don’t know who the fella ’is, but we’ll figure it out eventually. I just don’t see how we can have this type of violence here.” The sheriff, although irritated by the boys, recognizes their attempts to help and lets out a long sigh. As the three stare on at the thicket, another figure approaches them with an authoritative stride. 

“Are you two the Williams brothers? The two turned around to find a dark-haired woman dressed in professional attire. A notepad clutched in her hand. 

“Yes, we’re the Williams brothers.” Darren spoke out with an air of confidence. 

“I need to speak with you two privately. Sheriff.”

“Yes, ma’am.” The sheriff turns away and heads back towards the scene in the thicket. The beating morning sun shining a spotlight on the brothers and the woman in the field of tall grass. 

“I understand that you two claim to have seen some very upsetting things last night. Do you have any proof of those claims?”

Richie lights up at the suggestion of evidence and pulls out his cell phone. “Yes! We caught the form moving towards the garden here on my phone. I brought up the brightness as best I could.” The woman held the phone in one hand and deadpan watched as the amalgamation of cicadas approached the garden. 

“Delete this. It will be better for you. And don’t worry about giving a statement. Just pretend that none of this happened. You surveyed the garden last night, saw there were cicadas, and used the remaining insecticide under Ms. Washburn’s porch to frighten them off, and they didn’t return.” The woman said, mechanically delivering her instructions with precision. “But the body. How are you going to leave out the body and the symbol? What the hell was all that?” Darren looked shocked and moved a little closer to the woman during his own questioning. His fever was shut down with a simple boring stare by the woman. “Mr. Williams I would suggest you lower your tone and forget anything about a body from last night. We will pay you your flat rate sum for investigating if you just look the other way.”

“Hush money. What is going on here? And who are you?” Richie said, gaining volume with the conclusion of his statement.

“If that’s what you would like to call it, Mr. Williams, then yes. This is hush money. As for me, I wouldn’t worry. I doubt you’ll be seeing or hearing from me again. Good day, gentlemen.” At that the woman held out a check, waiting for one of them to take it. Darren eyed the check before collecting the dirty sum. The woman turned and walked towards the thicket to rejoin the investigation, leaving the boys alone in the grass. Sounds of police chatter mingled with the breeze that attempted to cool the ever-rising temperature. “What do you think?” Darren asked Richie, who still had his gaze intently on the woman. 

“I’m not thinking. I know they’re hiding something. No statements. No evidence. Something’s up.” Still focused on trying to find an answer to everything in his head. 

“Hey, I also know one thing,” said Darren, trying to bring Richie back to reality. “We got paid.” Darren shook the check in Richie’s face. “If it’s some deep state conspiracy, who cares? We got paid, and it’s the last we’ll see of it. I say we just take it on the chin and move on.” Richie looks at the check. The numbers are telling him to let it go and move on. His craving for answers is strong but not insatiable. “You’re right. It probably is just some sort of murder, and the state has to get involved usually anyway.” 

“See. Look, let’s go tell Ms. Washburn and get on our way.” Richie nods in agreement with his brother, and the two climb the stairs of the back porch and tell their client about the situation but nothing of the symbol, the woman, or the obstruction of evidence. Ms. Washburn nods her head, obviously just happy that her crop will be left alone. “Before y’all leave, I made something for you.” Ms. Washburn retreats to her kitchen and returns with an aluminum-wrapped pan. “Squash casserole. This’ll keep you boys fed for the next week.” Darren takes the pan from her and gives thanks for her generosity. The brothers return to their car and begin pulling away, and as they do, Richie finds the woman with his gaze. The two share a silent moment before she climbs into the black SUV and Darren pulls out of the driveway. The two leave Ms. Washburn’s once more. 

“That secret agent lady was kind of hot. She was giving you the looks.”

”I’ve had a lot of “firsts” in my life. First car. First heartbreak. First apartment. First funeral. But I only ever had one first kiss.

And I still think about him. Almost every day.

⸻

I met Eli when I was nine. We lived two streets apart, and our moms worked at the same hospital. Some nights, when they had overlapping shifts, I’d go to his house and we’d play Nintendo 64 on this clunky old TV that had to be smacked on the side to work.

He was the weird, quiet boy with a cowlick and oversized glasses. I was the loud, overly emotional girl with scraped knees and paint-stained hands. We couldn’t have been more different. But it worked.

He was my best friend. The kind of friend who’d help you bury your dead goldfish because you were too sad to do it yourself. The kind of friend who’d walk home with you every day even though it meant missing his favorite cartoon.

He used to tell me I was brave. I used to tell him he smiled like a secret.

God, I used to write his name in the margins of my notebooks like some obsessed lunatic. ELI. ELI. ELI.

But like most childhood things, it didn’t last.

⸻

We drifted sometime in middle school. He stopped showing up to class as often. Started wearing a hoodie even in summer.

Rumors spread. People whispered about “stuff going on at home,” but I never asked. And honestly, I was too caught up in my own world to reach out.

When I finally did — sophomore year, I think — he barely looked me in the eye. Just said, “Hey,” and walked off.

That was the last time I saw him.

Or so I thought.

⸻

I walked out to the mall. But before i entered i noticed something kinda weird. I saw a guy standing in the parking lot taking pictures at me. I didn’t think much about it and went inside.

Fate, as it turns out, is weirdly theatrical. Last fall, I was walking through the mall after work. Just killing time. I stopped in front of the food court, scrolling through my phone, when I heard someone say my name.

Not “hey.” Not “excuse me.” But my actual name. Like a prayer someone forgot they still remembered.

“Melissa?”

I turned — and there he was.

Eli.

But not the skinny, shy boy I remembered. He looked… older, obviously. Taller. But also — cuter. So stupidly cute.

Like one of those boys on sad indie movie posters. Sharp jaw. Crooked smile. Eyes that looked tired but kind.

He had this lopsided haircut that didn’t quite suit him, but somehow made him more attractive. And when I smiled, he smiled back — wide and real, and I swear to god my heart skipped.

⸻

We talked for hours that night. Sat in the corner of the food court with two half-eaten slices of pizza and cups of flat soda.

We talked about school. Life. Childhood. He told me he was working part-time at a bookstore downtown.

“I like the quiet,” he said.

I told him I was finishing up college. That I was still painting. That I had thought I’d outgrow that phase, but hadn’t.

He asked if I remembered the time I climbed his garage roof and refused to come down until he swore on his Nintendo cartridge that we’d be friends forever.

I told him of course I remembered. He said he never broke the promise.

And just like that, everything that had felt dead and gone cracked open like sunlight through blinds. It was warm again. Easy again.

By the time the mall closed, I didn’t want to leave. And judging by the way he walked me to my car — neither did he.

We exchanged numbers. And he hugged me. Tight. Like he meant it.

That night, I laid in bed staring at the ceiling and smiling like a goddamn idiot. I hadn’t felt that happy in years.

⸻

Over the next few weeks, we talked constantly. Texts. Late-night calls. Spontaneous meet-ups.

We’d go for walks through the park, talk about books, music, stupid memories from middle school. He’d bring me coffee at work. I’d leave sticky notes on his bike with bad doodles and inside jokes.

It felt like falling. Not just in love — but backwards, into something soft and familiar.

And then, one night…

He kissed me.

It was after a movie. We were sitting in his car in the parking lot, wrapped in silence and shared glances. He leaned in — slow, hesitant. I met him halfway.

It wasn’t perfect. Our noses bumped. My lip gloss stuck to his mouth.

But I didn’t care.

Because it was him.

On my way home though, i noticed this black Sedan driving past me. For a moment i thought i saw someone in the driving seat holding a camera.

⸻

Anyways. The week after that was magic. I floated through days like I was dreaming.

I painted more. Ate more. Slept better. Everything felt lighter.

Until the texts stopped.

⸻

It was a Thursday. I remember because we’d planned to meet after his shift at the bookstore. I texted: “Still on for 8?” No reply.

Then I tried again. And again.

Nothing.

I assumed maybe his phone died. Maybe he got called into work. Maybe — maybe — he just forgot.

The next day, still nothing. No texts. No calls. His phone went straight to voicemail.

I drove to the bookstore. The guy behind the counter told me Eli hadn’t shown up in three days. Didn’t call. Didn’t answer when they knocked at his door.

My stomach sank.

Something was wrong.

⸻

The funeral was small. Closed casket. Lots of whispered voices. Too many tissues and not enough answers.

He had taken his own life. Hung himself in the apartment above the bookstore. No note.

Just… gone.

I sat in the back row, clutching a tissue I never used, staring at the framed photo of him at the front of the chapel. Smiling. Eyes too tired for someone so young.

His mom spoke. So did his old friend Julian. But I couldn’t get up. I couldn’t speak. I didn’t even cry.

I just kept thinking:

“Why now?” Why after we found each other again? Why after we finally kissed?

⸻

A week later, I received a package. No return address. Just my name in his handwriting.

Inside was a sketchbook.

The first few pages were blank. Then came small pencil sketches. Of me.

Smiling. Sleeping. Sitting on his couch.

Then, written across one page in the center:

“You made the dark feel far away. I wish I could’ve stayed longer.”

⸻

People always talk about their first kisses like fairy tales. Like some glittering milestone in a life full of bright moments.

Mine ended with a funeral. A sketchbook. And a silence that still hasn’t left.

⸻

Sometimes, I dream about him. We’re sitting in the food court again, eating cold pizza and laughing. He reaches out to touch my hand. And I whisper, “You promised you’d never leave.”

He smiles.

But this time, he doesn’t say anything.

And when I wake up… I’m always crying.

This text could have ended like that, but im afraid it didnt.

A few days ago, I found something else.

An old letter Eli wrote me. It had been tucked inside a book he loaned me years ago — one I never returned.

His handwriting was messy but soft. Loopy. Familiar. It made me cry just looking at it.

And that’s when I remembered the sketchbook.

I pulled it out again. Flipped to the page with the message — “You made the dark feel far away. I wish I could’ve stayed longer.”

I compared them.

And my blood went cold.

It wasn’t the same handwriting. Not even close.

The loops were too sharp. The pressure too heavy. The slant was reversed. Whoever wrote that note…

Eli hadn’t written this.

I don’t know who did. Or what did. Or why they’d pretend to be him.

But the more I think about it — the cameras in the parking lot, the car that followed me, the drawings of me sleeping — the less this feels like a goodbye…

And the more it feels like a warning.",1,1754422953.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

It’s a small place, maybe five tables, and people are generally polite and keep to themselves. The kind of space where silence is assumed, but headphones aren’t mandatory.

Anyway, I was about an hour into working when a guy in his 20s asked if he could sit across from me, no problem, space was tight. We were both quiet for a while, then when I closed my laptop to go to the counter, he said: “Hey, just wanted to say, I really like your MacBook. Those M2 Pros are insane.”

I smiled and said, “Thanks, it’s actually the M1 Pro, not the M2. Still great though.”

He kind of paused, looked at me, and then gave that tight smile people give when they feel awkward and want to leave a conversation. I didn’t think much of it, grabbed my coffee, and went back to work.

When I got up to leave an hour later, the barista (who I chat with occasionally) said “Hey, uh, just so you know, the guy you were sitting with earlier said you were kind of rude.”

I was surprised. I asked what exactly he said, and apparently he told her I was “weirdly condescending” and “corrected him for no reason.” For reference, I didn’t laugh or say it smugly.. I literally just corrected the model name in a calm tone.

To me, it felt no different than someone calling a Mini Cooper a Fiat and you just go, “Oh, it’s actually a Mini”.. not to show off, just because… that’s what it is?

I didn’t mean to be pedantic. I just assumed since he brought up the model specifically, he cared about specs and I was replying in kind. I don’t even particularly care about MacBooks, I just know what I bought.

I told a friend and she said I probably should’ve just said “thanks” and moved on, and that technically correcting someone — even nicely, can come off as showing off.

A few hours ago, I stopped by Best Buy on a whim and found a display openbox M3 Pro (11/14-core, 18gb, 512gb SSD) for $769, $839 OTD. Model 3M524LL/A. Minor sticker stain after cleaning with iso on the lid, but otherwise flawless: no key or port issues, no dead pixels.

From what I can tell:
	•	Resells on eBay for ~$1,200–$1,300 (even with light wear)
	•	Refurbs go for $1,400–$1,600
	•	MSRP was $1,999

I upgraded from:
	•	MNEG3LL/A — 13” M2, 8-core CPU / 10-core GPU, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD
	•	Paid $1,400 new from Costco in 2022 (yikes, but I needed a Mac literally immediately)
	•	Now trades for ~$350–$450; eBay value ~$450–$600 depending on condition
	•	Mine has some visible pitting and palm wear

What I actually wanted:
	•	M3 Pro (3M525LL/A) – 11C/14G, 24GB RAM, 1TB SSD – $1,400–$1,500 used, $1,600–$1,700 refurb
	•	Or M4 Pro (MX2F3LL/A) – 14C/20G, 24GB/1TB – $2,100 new, ~$1,800–$2,000 used (hard to find)

The issue is: 512GB isn’t enough, especially for dev work (Unreal, games, local builds), and storage was the main reason I needed to upgrade, although I get the extra displays I need ASAP. But I still feel like I got a ridiculously good deal, and this could hold me over until I find the perfect config.

I just landed my first solid job and make good money (~$4k/mo), but the contract ends next year. I’d like a future-proof machine before then. Considering selling the old Mac or trading it toward a refurbished 1TB/24GB config at Best Buy or eBay, which would still save me ~$1,000 vs retail.

Only hesitation: no AppleCare. That makes me nervous since I’ve always had it, but I’m extremely careful: rainstand at home, padded case on the go, only bring to meetings (not coffee shops, etc.).

I am 37. He is 27.  So it was his birthday on Friday. We went and stayed at a hotel and then went for dinner. Then on Saturday morning, we were supposed to be spending some time together and he says to me, while I’m getting ready, babe, I don’t think I’m going to be able to spend time with you today. I really need to see my family. They are leaving town today

I was like OK babe, I understand.  So later in the evening, he is texting me while he is apparently at dinner with his family. Then he tells me that he has no service. And send me a bunch of random text. I called him, no answer. I legitimately believed him at this point, but I thought it was weird. He did not answer my call nor did he call me back .

And for some reason, the next morning, my intuition told me to check his friends Instagram page. I saw a story on with my boyfriend at a bar on the strip with his humongous drink in his hand and a huge smile on his face. My heart sank

I tried calling him a couple times, there was no answer and he had his phone on do not disturb. I texted him. It’s urgent and I need to meet up with him. 

I met up with him in person, and I casually asked him some questions about what he did with his family, knowing the truth. He continue to lie to me to my face. Then I told him what I knew. He continuously lied, even after being presented with evidence. I didn’t show him the picture though.  His first words out of his mouth were, are you keeping dips on me? Are you keeping dips on me? Are you tracking me,? Did you install a GPS tracker in my car?

He proceeds to continue telling me lies and becomes very defensive and flips it back on me that I am keeping tabs on him 

He eventually confesses to me, only after he couldn’t lie anymore. He was the one that actually booked the dinner reservation with his friends, he told me it was a guys night then too. However, one of the other guys‘s girlfriend showed up and was spending the evening with them apparently so I was basically excluded and lied to. I also knew that he went to a strip club, my intuition for some reason. I asked him, did you go to your strip club?. He said yes.

We didn’t actually have sex because he hadn’t shown me his STD results at the time we were at the hotel. He told me he got tested on Friday. Well, turns out he actually tested on Wednesday, and he tested positive for chlamydia. He immediately, all of this was something hidden to me, went and got medication from the pharmacy, hoping that it would clear by the time he tested on Friday. So, he tested on Friday and he was still positive. He lied to me saying that he never got his results back the whole time he knew that he had chlamydia. He also gave me oral sex at the hotel, potentially infecting me.

I told him that we were done, I walked off and went to my car, he knocked on the window, I drove off 

From me, I find it hard to leave relationships right away, so I like to call him in the evening and he was an asshole over the phone, but he wanted an answer from me. Write them in there if we were done or not we were in a relationship. I told him I didn’t know . I said we would need to talk about it the next day. That was yesterday that we met up again and he was just a complete jerk to me at the coffee shop that I asked him to meet me at. No remorse, no regret no sympathy, no empathy, absolutely nothing Coldhearted and ruthless.

Like not the person I had known for the past two months. I posted him online, just asking if anybody else was talking to him, because at that point, I had no trust in him. It was not to be mean or anything. I just genuinely wanted answers. I didn’t say anything about him personally nor his character. In addition, any time I would bring up a problem, it would turn into an argument because he would flip it on me. He said to me before when I brought up an argument, after all I’ve done for you, this is how you treat me? I’m such a good person to you and I treat you so well, and this is how you treat me? It would go deeper than that, though it would be full on manipulation.

Then yesterday evening, we meet up in person, he asked me if I posted him online. I told him no, he basically ended the relationship right then in there saying he can’t have his reputation tarnished. And he can’t do this anymore. Then we both start crying. And we literally like talking back-and-forth for probably two hours. Then I finally come to my senses which he was shocked about because the narrative changed at that point. I was no longer this girl that was crying her eyes out really sad. I told him that actually, this was a blessing in disguise and thank you for setting me free from this unhealthy relationship. I said no man that truly loves me would lie to my face and betray me like this. No man that truly love me would be liking a bunch of naked women on Instagram constantly and then flipping the script back on me whenever I bring up a problem. So I said I thank you for that. He was so shocked. It was so hard for me to walk away and he did that for me. So for that. I am truly grateful.

I'm seeking to expand my circle of friends. I have a girlfriend that I'm very much in love with, and don't intend to change that anytime soon. 

However, the older I get, the harder it is to make regular plans with my longtime friends or meet/make new friends (which we can all relate to), which is what I'm hoping to tackle by posting here.

A bit about myself:



\- I live in Scarborough. But I have a car and am all over the city and the GTA often.



\- Atheist/secular. I have no problem hanging out with religious folk (and have many religious friends), as long as you're not trying to convert me or use it as an excuse to hate on people.



\- Politically; I'm left-leaning. I don't expect the people I'm friends with to have the exact same views as me, but if you have similar views, we'll probably get along better, no? I have friends with different views; centrist,  right-of-center - but if you're far-right/Nazi adjacent, we probably won't mesh well 🤷🏿‍♂️.



\- My main hobbies are writing (fiction), reading  (novels and comic books) and watching shows and movies. My favorite genres to watch are crime,  mystery, sci- and fantasy, but if the writing and acting is good, I'll probably like it.



\- I love PC gaming. Currently replaying New Vegas and Skyrim. Also playing Fallout 4 and Witcher 3. Other games I love but am not currently playing are VTMB, KotOR 1 and 2, and Red Dead Redemption 2.



\- I'm obsessed with music. I have over 1000 full albums. My favorite genres are punk, rock and metal,  but I have all sorts of genres in my music library. I go to concerts every now and then, whenever someone I love passes through.



\- I'm a foodie. I eat and enjoy everything; could be a food truck,  fine dining and everything in-between (maybe not fine dining too often in this economy 🤣).



\- I love a nice long walk. Whether it's in the city, a hike in a park/forest, I love a good stroll; whether it's solo or with buddies. 



Hopefully that gives you an idea of who I am but if there's questions you have, I'm happy to answer.

1miiogz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1miiogz/i_think_i_got_microcheated_on_by_my_bf/,i think i got microcheated on by my bf,"me 19F and my bf 20M (we r both in clg) started dating a little more than two years ago, everything was amazing until the 6th month when he went out w his best friend from his highschl days, he used to hv a huge crush on her and he also flirted with her until a few weeks before we started dating. so i wasnt very ok w them meeting but he started saying i was wrong  for thinking that started defending her which i felt was weird anyways a lot of arguments later he stopped talking to her as much.
2 months after that i found out he was following a bunch of girls and liked some pics of his girl friends that seemed very revealing and i voiced my discomfort to which he said i was being controlling and manipulating, again cut to a few arguments later he stopped liking those pictures and unfollowed some microinfluencers.
later on our anniversary i found out that he had tagged a girl (she was a microinfluencer) on a post that was her post but reposted by another acc. (note that before we started dating he used to be one of the guys in her comment section and dms calling her pretty) so now that he was dating he had no reason to tag her in any kind of posts or be associated w her. i found this out on our anniversary and he blamed me for ruining our anniversary because “i couldve brought it up later”. anyways few arguments later we sorted that out
cut to 4 months later now here is where the problem starts- new semester started and he took a break from the relationship claiming he needed space as at that point we kept having fights but during the break i was very disturbed and as i m an anxious attachment type of person i was completely destroyed. he reached out to me 8 days later wanting to talk again and try to end the break during which he told me he made a new female friend in his new class and had shared everything from our relationship w her whicch was odd to me as he just met her why does she know ab our relationship?? but i was glad he was making friends so i didnt say much

(to remember- a couple months befroe this i had gone out w one of my male friends that i had known for more than a year to collect his lunch and i went alone w him as no friends were there and i had tiffin so he needed to eat and my bf got upset ab it saying he felt uncomfortable that i hung out w any guy alone so he said not to and i said ok becuz idc ab anything unless and until my man feels comfortable its ok)(not hanging out 1v1 w anyone of the other gender became a rule in our relationship that we both were rly ok w)

so back to his new female friend- i found out that during our break he had gone out not once not twice but thrice w her to smoke and talk about our relationship 1v1 stating that he broke the rule that HE set for us, when i confronted him he said its important to have trust in a relationship, given that he was making friends i was happy and i definitely got upset but i was trying to be okay with it. i told him pls dont go smoke because i think its intimate in a way and i definitely felt uncomfortable. later a in few days we got back tog all ok (still feeling weird ab that girl) she apparently had a “crush” on my bfs bsf so she sent him some reels that were inappropriate to send to ANYONE BUT UR OWN BF implying she wanted to do those things to the bsf and he tease flirted w her replied to those reels and i WAS NOT OK with that but anyway few days later he lied tome and went to smoke w her then when i found out he tried to cover it up saying i didnt tell u bec i thought you’d get upset after sorting that out i told him to not lie to me and to be transparent and if he wanted to go out w her js go to canteen and have coffee or sm few days later i kept calling him texting him wanting to know where he was appaarently he went w her to where he took me on our first date for lunch after classes and that was my last straw we had fights over fights broke up i asked him to cut her off at this point she had literally sent inappropriate “this or that” quiz texts directed to MY BF and i asked him to cut her off he did he removed her pvt acc from his pvt acc and THEn she removed me and him from our main to her main and blockef the both of us.. he was very upset but tried to cut her off we had broken up but we were trying to mend things when he wrote in a para that i wanna get back ily and blah balh ur amazing etc and his second para was but i dont want to cut her off she means a lot to me and i want her in my life… she unblocked him later but not me anyway we were in a situationship and fighting for the next lot of weeks and got back tog after 4 months at which point he had minimal contact w her and everything was very good he blokcef her accounts on his own only to reassure me and i thought everything was good.. his class went on a trip the next month and she went up to him and told him he meant so much to her and she was hurt that he cut her off and he also till date has said things ab me but anyway when he came back he broke up w me saying i was controlling. i was blindsided because we had the perfect date before he went on that trip he was romantic and now suddenly everything had changed.. he brokw up w me and i was still trying to understand him so i still went and talked to him when i noticed it hadnt even been 12 hours for him to break up w me and he had already unblocked her and added her back. it broke my heart idk how but i still wanted to make things work so i said its ok tried to make it work he said he needed break from all of this and me so he took a break in which was our two year anniversary andd my bday he didnt text me for 12 days then texted me on my bday asking to meet said he missed me and wanted to get back i said no take ur time dont rush so he took a little less than a week contacted me again and we started talkiing again.. got back tog 2&1/2 months later… cut to right now he still talks to her i’m uncomfortable with that he thinks i’m controlling and i’m not sure what to do..",1,1754421839.0,Advice,0,0.67,False

Before, I had a belief that I needed coffee to function. Quitting made me realize that this isn't true. While I've certainly had some rough days where coffee would've helped in the short term, I've also had good days where I didn't need it at all. Now I know that I don't need coffee everyday in order to function. Right now, I'm drinking coffee on an occasional basis, which has become possible because quitting for that long changed my beliefs. I couldn't moderate my use until I had enough proof it wasn't a necessity. It still gets tempting to drink coffee everyday but so far, I've been able to stay away from reforming a daily habit. When I had a daily habit and believed I needed it to function, I would drink it every day, even when I felt anxious or stressed, and it made my anxiety so much worse.

1miilqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hatnode/comments/1miilqv/hatnode_mini_series_colors_34_black/,Hatnode Mini series COLORS 3/4 - BLACK,"Within a secure meeting room in the belly of the Office of Neural Health at Hatnode, eight men, each dressed in dark, immaculate suits, sat around a long mahogany table. The wood was old and smooth beneath their restless hands.



No one rushed to speak.



The eldest among them finally broke the hush, his voice low and weary. “It’s trauma from the Incident,” he said, staring at the reflections in his untouched drink. “You can’t witness that much death and expect people to be okay. The average citizen has probably seen more death than the coroners of the past.”



The man closest to the security display didn’t look away from its shifting glow. “It’s not just trauma,” he said, calm but certain. “These cases are almost identical. The same stories, over and over. People frozen in their beds, seeing things. The Red-Eyed Man. The Hatman. The Old Hag. People are starting to experience some of these hallucinations while awake.”



Another man, thin and anxious, spoke next. “The Smiling Visitor. The Backwards Woman. The Hanged Child. There are basically a dozen of these entities that seem to exist across the world. We think the Hanged Child and the Backwards Woman probably came from cross-contamination with another world. Reports of them are in their history books, not ours. And suddenly, after they bring in a group of refugees, those figures start showing up? That’s not normal.”



The hum of filtered air filled the silence between them, each man weighed down by memory and unease.



“Plus, take a look at this.” The man operating the display shifted the screens to a new report. “Some people in another world, with no previous record of the Hatman, have begun to see him after one of our soldiers with a history of these experiences visited their world. Whatever that thing is, it spreads! That’s not just psychological. We can’t ignore this data. Something needs to be done!”



The man seated at the far end of the table spoke up, his tone cautious. “They aren’t harming us. Do we really want to dabble in something like this? Those things have coexisted with humanity as far back as our records go. They only affect a small group of people, and they never hurt anyone. Let’s not stir the pot. Especially not a pot with murky water when we have no idea how deep it goes.”



At the far end of the table, the youngest of the group finally broke his silence. He sat upright, fingers steepled, eyes reflecting the faint blue light. “If these things are real,” he said, “we need a way to defend against them.”



He glanced around the table, searching their faces for any sign of doubt. “We’ve paid for ignorance before, thinking we were untouchable, that nothing outside our understanding could ever reach us. Humanity nearly didn’t survive that lesson. That’s why we’re here now.”



He let his hand rest, steady, against the mahogany. “It’s our duty to protect every last Human. Monster, alien, ghost, demon… it doesn’t matter what shape the threat takes.”



The blue glow flickered in his eyes. “We have proof now. Doesn’t matter whether it fits into our understanding of science or the supernatural. If it’s real, we have to act.”



He leaned back and gave a small nod to the man at the display. “I called in a favor from Karin. She has a research division that deals with the… unusual. They’re equipped for this kind of thing.”



On cue, the screens shifted. Surveillance footage revealed a young woman waiting in the lobby, messy hair tucked under a hoodie, earphones clamped over her ears. She looked half-asleep, half-alert, surrounded by a ring of sleek security robots.



The youngest man’s lips curled into a thin smile. “Karin’s lent us someone from the Esoteric Research Division. Her name is Elis.”



He watched the girl on the screen, then looked back at the others. “She’s our first step.”



“Esoteric Research Division,” the eldest director mused, his tone dry. “Are they really going to loan out an immortal asset? I guess they really are taking this seriously.”



“She’s not immortal. Just young.” The youngest director tapped the table, scanning a tablet. “Karin gave me some background so we know how to navigate around the rough edges.”



“Rough edges? That doesn't sound good.” one of the men asked, an eyebrow raised. “What’s this Esoteric Research Division really about?”



""They are a special division of Karin's private research organization. They fall directly under the founders of Hatnode. Mostly Tier 8 classified,” the youngest replied.



""And what can you tell us about Elis herself?"" he asked.



“I can’t share much. But here’s what I know: her father was one of the founders of the Division. Her track record is… almost entirely classified, meaning most of what she’s done has been by direct order from the founders, just like this time. But… she was involved in developing the world’s Dimensional Protection System, the DPS. She’s also considered a protected asset. We’re to keep her alive, keep her fed. There’s a human guard watching her at all times, on top of the robot security. That’s on Karin’s recommendation, she told us to keep an eye on her at all times.”



“Why? Is she dangerous?” another voice asked, hesitant.



""I don't know…  But, she’s one of the very few cleared to research mind control, and other things even I don’t have access to. She might be dangerous with her words alone. So… just to be safe, If you talk to her, use the buddy system.”



A beat of silence passed around the table.



Finally, someone muttered, “What the hell did we get ourselves into?”



**--- Elis, five months later, Research Lab Server Room --**



The server room breathes around me. I've been awake for seventy-two hours and my eyelids twitch like dying relays.



I crouch barefoot on perforated tile. My coffee’s gone corpse-warm.



The dark does not mind. The code racing across three monitors does not care.



But the void cares: 1,024 EEG samples, four perfect seconds, missing from volunteer 47’s REM.



Silence so exact it feels stolen, a heartbeat lifted with surgical precision. My pulse speeds. I’ve seen every type of data corruption known to this field of science, but this feels deliberate. Personal. 



*Bet it’s them again.*



I brush hair out of my eyes, squinting at the waveform as if daring it to flinch.



Karin bankrolls this place with a blank check, military sensors, robots in every aisle, dimensional shielding, everything you can think of. 



It makes the darkness feel very safe. I’ve never liked bright server rooms, so I shut them all off. If I’m going to be stuck in this building, I might as well make it feel like home.



A human guard walks across the aisle and squints at me for a second, probably wondering if I should be here.



They leave. They don’t. I don’t care.



Only the LEDs pulse, slow, mechanical lungs sealed in metal ribs.



I replay the gap.



Quiet pushes against my eardrum as if it wants in. I smile. Coffee ripples; dust vibrates.



I can feel it.



A single black seed. Black. Breathing. *Am I losing my mind?*



Our machines still aren’t great at picking up the presence of fringe entities. I’ve come to realize my instinct is always much more accurate.



Yeah. I can feel it in the data.



An urge to lick the open ports pools behind my teeth.



Constructs again. Father’s favorite obsession. He always warned me about dimensional fuckery splashing onto every aspect of reality, equations smuggled into ordinary data. 



But I’m the kind of girl who draws equations on her wrist. I won’t believe the dark until I see its math. I'm going to figure this out on my own.



I brace my toes on the epoxy; if it were soil I’d dig in.



LEDs quicken, inhale, exhale, like lungs urging me to finish a thought. 



What connects sleep paralysis, PTSD, and hallucinations?



They share something subtle, something dark: a presence that doesn't quite belong inside the mind. A whisper at the edges of awareness, a chill felt rather than seen.



Shadow people.



The Night Hag.



Nightmares that bleed into your room.



Figures camped on the margins of sight, gone the instant you look straight on. 



At first, they seem unrelated, disconnected fragments haunting scattered minds. But what if they're symptoms of something deeper?



Damaged minds become open doors.



Subject 47 was as damaged as they come.



A relay snaps; the lungs of the datacenter exhales warm air. 



Dad used to say trauma was fertile soil; I laughed.



What did he know of trauma beyond scribbles in notebooks? But now, standing barefoot among servers that hum like insects, my spine itches. I shift my loose shirt, adjusting it uselessly, unable to shake the feeling that i'm doing something catastrophic. 



Another relay. Another breath.



I pick at the skin beside my thumb. Somewhere in the dark, a server fan stutters. For a second, I swear I hear breathing that isn’t mine.



My father once warned me about these things: living data, parasites in the conceptual layer. He scribbled notes in his margins about ideas that spread through myths, nightmares whispered from one damaged mind to another. But he never faced them directly, he was always busy building something secretive for Hatnode. Weapons probably… or worse.



But I’m here. Alone with servers humming like insects, sifting sleep paralysis EEGs and cocaine-induced psychosis scans, wondering why every victim sees the same silhouette watching from doorways or corners of vision. Something neither solid nor imaginary, something murderously real, growing roots inside humans.



Another relay snaps. My pulse skips. The fan whispers again.



*Why?*



My watch vibrates.



\[SLEEP ALERT: 74 hours awake. Severe deprivation detected. Rest is recommended, Elis.\]



I laugh, sharp and humorless. I dismiss it.



Staying awake is part of the experiment. The longer I go, the clearer they become.

I rub my eyes. It all started when Karin came back, changed. She wouldn’t say what happened in that other world, just that something called the Entities was real, and we needed to be afraid. 

That fear built the division. My Father got dragged into it.

*He's a weird guy.* 



My father never left me at home, he brought me into the Esoteric Research Division like I was another briefcase. The company didn’t care. He asked for clearance and I got it, even as a kid. No oversight, not for us.



Somewhere, another relay *clicks*. I flinch, just a little.



I remember meetings that went on forever. Hushed arguments behind glass. The soft scrape of pen on forbidden files. They let me sit in the corner, headphones on, pretending not to listen. But I listened. I always listened. Whispers about Entities, about data twisting, about things pressing against the walls of reality.



I learned to read off declassified memos, to count using nervous laughter and the number of coffee cups on the table.



Osmosis. That’s how I became an expert.



*Another click.* I’m back in the server room, back in the dark.



For now, I’m just on loan to the Office of Neural Health while I figure this one out. They’ve been getting too many reports lately.



I'm tired…



My chin sinks; the code blurs to soft gray static. 



For an instant I’m certain I’ve shut my eyes, but across the aisle a silhouette is standing, tall as the racks, edges seething like heat-ripples.



\[ BING \]



I jerk upright, heartbeat slamming the inside of my skull; the figure is gone, fans wheeze back on, the data on the monitors snap into razor focus. The data on the screen was exactly what I expected, I found the source.



“I found it!”



I accidentally drop to the floor. 



My legs sprawl, bare skin numb on the cold tile.



On the monitor: there it is. A sliver of brain tissue, hiding in plain sight, existing in every subject who’s seen the shadows. The perfect pocket. A nest for something to crawl into.



My heart stutters, “I… knew it.""



The thing was a fucking memetic virus, threading through trauma, putting down roots. Shadow people, leaping from mind to mind, no, from wound to wound.



My breath fogs on the screen.



All this time, it was just a node. A door.



Small, but enough.



I smile, counting the beats of my pulse, waiting for the darkness to notice I’ve seen it.



*You can't hide from me.*



I need to cut it out if that pocket’s the entryway.



""Let’s see what slamming the door does.""



I queue the brain surgery bots.  



In the monitor glass I catch my own reflection… pupils wide, *black.*

Hey, I’m V. 27. Emotionally available (I most probably think, still figuring out how to let people in, but don’t worry I’ll be there for you)  coffee addict, and low-key philosopher on weekends.
Based in India. Currently transitioning into psychiatry, not just as a profession but as a way to understand myself and others more deeply.

I’ve spent the last few years unlearning the noise, the expectations, the masks, the roles we’re told to play. I’m not perfect, but I’m present. I’m someone who listens to the silence between the words, someone who wants to know the ‘why’ behind the ‘what.’

I’ve seen enough to know that most people carry invisible weight. I don’t expect you to be cheerful all the time, I just hope you’re honest. I value honesty more than charm, awareness more than aesthetics, and kindness more than cleverness.

I love conversations that start with “what’s your favorite street snack?” and end with “do you think souls recognize each other?” If you can laugh mid-existential crisis or dance in your living room without needing a reason, I’m already a fan.

Not here to play games unless it’s wordplay or Uno (and I will call you out if you stack a Draw 4 on a Draw 2, that’s not how it works).

I’m a sucker for vulnerability, sarcastic wit, long drives, and the kind of hugs that say more than words. Let’s skip the awkward small talk and get straight to: “What made you who you are?”

So yeah… if your idea of fun includes deep talks, bad jokes, philosophy, Vedanta teachings, and eye contact that feels like home , slide in. Let’s see if you are weird and mine are compatible. 

And yes, I’ll be honest, physical attraction matters to me. I don’t want to pretend it doesn’t. I believe both emotional and physical connection are important in a relationship. I want to be with someone I genuinely find beautiful, not just to admire, but to feel proud of, to cherish, to never have my heart or eyes wander, even by accident. I want to feel that pull, that spark, not just in the beginning, but every time I look at her. Everyone deserves to feel chosen, completely. And I want to offer that fully, and expect the same in return.

1miibo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1miibo5/having_a_super_weird_stool_problem/,Having a super weird stool problem,"So I strongly suspect I have candida overgrowth and have for 5 years. Doctors haven't been able to figure anything out. Symptoms similar-ish to SIBO but SIBO treatment/antibiotics show virtually no improvement.

Figured what the heck ill go low carb cant hurt. I went low carb, started taking bitters before meals (I have loose greasy light colored stools usually with undigested food in them). Also started taking caprylic acid since its good for killing fungus in the digestive tract.

Well after about 5 days my stools become immaculate. Literally perfect and I can go any time of day where before i could only go in the morning. Im talking every aspect of the stool improved dramatically to the point where I couldn't ask for anything better. It was wild.

(Interestingly, he only other benefit i felt was mental clarity. None of my other dozens of symptoms really improved, althoufh i suspect they have have if i had continued).

I did this for about 3 weeks when suddenly I had a presyncope episode that scared me really bad. Took pounding electrolytes constantly for days to start feeling normal again and I also just started eating carbs and stopped the caprylic acid because I was too scared.

However, after the presyncope episode, adding carbs back to normalize levels, and stopping caprylic acid, I developed a totally new issue: stools that look even worse than before (looser, paler, stinkier, greasier). *At first, these newly terrible stools smelled of yeast. This lasted for a few days and strongly signaled that I may in fact be dealing with a candida issue.*

Paradoxically, along with these worse, very loose stools, I am really having trouble having a bowel movement at all. I am consistently backed up now and cant even empty to the point of being out of pain unless i take something to induce a bowel movement (at least mild laxatives, coffee etc. Had to resort to a suppository this morning).

I don't know what to do at this point. Im starting to titrate my carbs back down (with more electrolytes support) and started taking flucanozole 5 days agonand caprylic acid again 2 days ago but I haven't seen any improvement. Ive only been able to see one doctor so far and he's confused about the loose stools constipation. Just said take prune juice and soluble fiber but thats basically just diarrhea.

Anybody have any idea what I should do? Sorry this is so long but its so complicated I barely even covered all the pertinent details.",1,1754421032.0,Biohackers,1,1.0,False

This the Kingfisher by Sid Naique. It's a masterful piece of art. He has a lot of stuff on his website, and you can find him on many others. But this is by far my favorite.

It took 50 hours to print in total. I had three stuck filament errors to correct and one was when I was asleep so it was stuck for 4 hours. But my XL handled them perfectly. Paused and resumed and no layer shift or anything to give an indication that it got stuck.  Slicer estimated it to print 1D15h23m. So the pauses added up. 

There were 3110 tool changes, and I printed in stealth mode. 

Sunlu Black, Sunlu Translucent Blue, Sunlu Coffee, Sunlu Transparent, Sunlu Silk White. All PLA.

This was the answer, tell me your thoughts, would you play this version or is it AI slop?:





Here are Alternate Universe Patch Notes for Tekken 8 – Season 2 in a world where the designers actually listened to the community (and not just the shareholders):

⸻

🎮 TEKKEN 8: Season 2 Patch Notes – Community-Driven Update

“This patch is dedicated to all the lab monsters, tournament grinders, and casual warriors who love this game with all their heart (and fists).”

⸻

🧠 Core System Changes
	•	Heat System Revamp:

	•	Heat is now optional and doesn’t auto-activate on moves.

	•	Heat Smash and Heat Dash consume less health when used, rewarding skill, not button mashing.

	•	No more chip damage KOs unless you’re in Rage.

	•	Rage Art Adjustments:

	•	You can now toggle cinematic length in settings: Full / Short / Off.

	•	Rage Arts now have armor only during startup, not active frames.

	•	Online QoL Updates:

	•	TRUE Wi-Fi filter added. Players on Wi-Fi are visibly labeled.

	•	Rollback Netcode 2.0 implemented with smoother performance for long-distance matches.

	•	Rematch button now works properly in Player Match without both players mashing X for 30 seconds.


	•	Added Training Mode While Waiting in Ranked/Quick Match.

⸻

⚔️ Balance Changes (Focused on fairness, not flash)

Universal
	•	Backdashes are now slightly longer, restoring movement freedom from Tekken 7.

	•	Launchers on unsafe strings nerfed across the board.

	•	Characters now have more unique defensive tools instead of everyone sharing Heat system tools.

⸻

🔥 Character Changes Highlights

Victor
	•	Hitbox on shotgun cleaned up. No more phantom hits from 2 meters away.
	•	Nerfed random guard breaks; now requires proper timing.
	•	Added gun holster animation. Respect the drip.

Azucena
	•	Less coffee spam. Taunt animations reduced.
	•	Movement speed reduced slightly; dodge stance now minus on block.
	•	Chained side-steps now have more risk-reward.

Reina
	•	No longer a Mishima-lite. Has her own unique electric-style move with frame trap follow-ups.
	•	Electric inputs made more lenient for accessibility, but execution-rewarded versions still hit harder.

Feng
	•	Parry window reduced; no longer feels like he’s guessing right 100% of the time.
	•	Low crush nerfed. Riskier to abuse.

King
	•	Running grabs are now side-steppable if timed well.
	•	Tech trap damage reduced; throws now scale better with opponent health.

Devil Jin
	•	Laser shenanigans reduced. Launch follow-ups after airborne laser removed.
	•	Laser in Heat now plus on block, but not jail-on-hit anymore.

Law
	•	Backflip evasion range reduced.
	•	No more parry into guaranteed launcher on strings that should jail.
	•	Flipkick launch height normalized. No more air combos off magic.

Lili
	•	Sidestep and pirouette range adjusted — still stylish, now less broken.
	•	Mid pokes adjusted to give opponents better whiff punish options.

⸻

🎯 Competitive & Training Tools
	•	Frame Data now FREE and color-coded by frame advantage/disadvantage.
	•	Added hitbox viewer for training mode.
	•	Added “Reversal Practice” mode to learn punishes for strings & launchers.
	•	Tournament Mode added: disables all cinematic Rage Arts and limits Heat to 1 use per round.

⸻

👕 Cosmetics & Monetization
	•	All outfits can now be unlocked through gameplay OR purchased. No more $8 glasses.
	•	Legacy outfits from Tekken 3–6 added for free if you own previous games.
	•	No NFTs, no battle pass, no loot boxes. Just fighting.

⸻

🎁 Community Love Additions
	•	Character Poll Winner: Armor King gets full rework with grapples + feints.
	•	Jun’s Theme from TTT2 added as selectable BGM.
	•	You can now mute specific emotes, taunts, and win poses.
	•	Player card customization includes fun stats like “most sidesteps” or “rage quit count.”

⸻

“This patch wouldn’t exist without the community’s feedback. Tekken is YOUR game — thanks for making it better.”

- The Devs (in the alternate universe where they listen to Reddit, YouTube, and EVO top 8s)

1mii9l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/1mii9l4/im_mostly_recovered_after_severely_flaring_in_the/,I'm mostly recovered after severely flaring in the past,"I just want to spread some hope, because I really would have needed this in the past. In 2017, eight years ago, I developed UC and went from proctitis to fulminant pancolitis within a few months. I was hospitalized and didn’t respond to medication (steroids, Humira, Remicade, ciclosporin). I went down to 48 kg at 184 cm and needed two blood transfusions. I literally thought my life, as I knew it before, had ended. Very dark times.

I somehow fought my way out after being in the hospital for six weeks and started to work on my diet. I didn’t make major changes, but I reduced gluten and dairy, and I also tried a lot of supplements. Over the course of the next months, I got better and eventually also stopped taking medication. Over the last eight years, I only had two small flares — otherwise I’m doing well. I still struggle with fatigue and minor nerve pain, but the bleeding and diarrhea are gone. My colon works like it used to. I can still consumn things like gluten, diary, coffee, alcohol, chocolate, but I tend to reduce it.

This post isn’t meant to encourage stopping medication — I just wanted to show that life can drastically change. Like I said, when I was 23 years old, I thought I was done and would never get better. But hey, I somehow made it. Life can and will get better — hang in there!",2,1754420900.0,UlcerativeColitis,1,1.0,False

1mii9ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1mii9ax/anyone_know_title_and_where_to_read/,Anyone know title and where to read?,"I had never doubted my husband's love for me.Until that day, I went home early to suprise him.Then I saw my husband in our hot tub, undressed, with another woman.I stood frozen for several moments and watched as their pecking turned to heavy petting.His hand disappeared under the water, and she let out a porn worthy moan.He groaned and mumbled something I couldn't hear, and she reached into the water to grab him as well.When he lifted her onto his lap, he finally saw me... standing in the doorway between our home and the back yard, tears streaming down my face.I couldn’t bear it anymore.""Ben!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the air.Anger boiling in my veins. How could he do this to me?

————————Melanie

“What time will you be home?” I handed Ben his travel cup and briefcase.“I think it will be an early night for once… how about you meet me in the city, and we can go dinner tonight?” Ben shrugged on his coat and gave me a hopeful look.“That sounds lovely. I’ll Uber to your work that way we can ride home together.” I gave him a quick pecking. “Around 5 sound good?”“Perfect.” He pulled me close to his body and gave me a second, deeper pecking. “I love you more today, Mrs. Landon.”“And I’ll love you more tomorrow,” I finished with a little smile.Even though we had been married for five years and together for ten, he never failed to remind me just how much he loved me. Ben and I grew up on the same street. He was friends with my brother and two years ahead of me, but by the time I was entering my sophomore year of high school, and he was entering his senior year, he had declared to anyone that would listen that I was his forever. We even survived the two years of long distance, and he proposed the day I graduated from high school.Our parents were absolutely livid when I moved in with him right after high school and chose to skip college and practice being a stay-at-home wife. I had wanted to go to college, but Ben explained that we needed to wait until he finished his degree so he could afford to send me to school. He always made sure to point out just how helpful having me home was for his education and how all his peers were so jealous that he had someone to help him carry his stress. Two years ago, I asked him about pursuing a degree at the community college, but he said it wasn’t the right time yet because he was just starting to build his wealth and was hoping to start a family soon. It all made sense to me, even if I did think that part of his motivation was that he liked being able to brag about being such a good provider. Honestly, I loved being a stay-at-home wife, and I was really good at being frugal, so I barely cost him anything.Benjamin was what you might call a “finance bro” and worked for a big hedge fund company in L.A., and three years ago, he started landing some of the big clients. It turned out he had a sixth sense when it came to investing money, and they jokingly called him Midas at work. From what he told me, he was on track to have a n-et worth of almost five million dollars by the end of the year.It was a typical Friday for me: I went for my morning walk with a few of the wives from Ben’s country club, picked up his dry cleaning, went shopping for our weekend meals, cleaned the house, and did a little bit of gardening. By the time it was 3 p.m. I was already worn out, but excited to go on a date with my husband.I pulled up to his work at 4:55 wearing a bodycon style dress in a dark green that brought out the green in my eyes, two-inch kitten heels, and a stylish gold blazer. My hair was down in soft curls, and I had gone a little darker and sexier than usual with my makeup. The best part of the outfit was hidden under the dress: a matching dark green lace bra and panty set that I knew Ben was going to love.When I got to his office, I wasn’t surprised that he wasn’t alone. His boss and two women were seated around his desk and discussing one of the clients.“Hello!” I said cheerfully as I stepped into the room.“Mrs. Landon! I’m sorry I wasn’t out there to greet you!” Sydney, Ben’s secretary, said with an apologetic grimace. Sydney was old enough to be my mother and had been with Ben from day one. We had always joked that she wasn’t actually Ben’s secretary because she came with the office itself.“Not to worry, Ben knew I was coming.” I assured her and walked around the desk to stand next to my husband.I didn’t recognize the second woman, and we eyed each other briefly with neutral expressions before Ben’s boss spoke up.“Melanie, you look more beautiful every time I see you.” Peter said and reached over the desk for my hand. Ben pretended to growl and pulled me into his lap.“Eyes to yourself Mr. Nunley!” Ben joked, and then we all laughed.“Melanie, this is Ms. Reed, my secretary.” Peter said and waved a hand in the direction of the other woman.“It’s nice to meet you.” I said pleasantly. She offered a thin smile and returned the sentiment.“Well, I promised my lovely wife I’d take her out on a date tonight.” Ben pecked the top of my head, and I giggled. “So, I’m going to ask you all to get out of my office now.” He smirked at Peter, “and close the door behind you.”“Ben!” I hissed and smacked his arm.Everyone but Ms. Reed laughed before they said their goodbyes. She gave both Ben and I a polite smile and head nod before she exited the room.“That one doesn’t have the happiest personality, huh?” I commented after the door clicked shut.“She’s a little frosty but Peter says she competent and she’s such an ice queen that Peter’s wife hasn’t complained about how young she is.” Ben shrugged and then turned my head towards his so he could peck me. “How about a quickie before dinner?” He wiggled his eyebrows.“Mr. Landon!” I gasped, “Are you propositioning me?”“I think I am, Mrs. Benjamin Landon.” He lifted me to his desk and spread my legs so he could stand between them.“As tempting as that offer is, and believe me it’s tempting… I didn’t get new lingerie for a quickie on your desk.” I stuck my tongue out. He quirked a brow and tilted his head to try and look up my dress. I smacked his chest with a giggle and then slid off his desk and to my knees. “I am willing to find out just how waterproof this make up really is though.”I smirked as his face lit up with a giant smile and he started tugging at his belt. Together, we released his trapped shaft, and I gently licked the drop of precum that had formed on the tip. He groaned and sank back into his chair.“Hands to yourself!” I warned before I swallowed half his length in one go. Ben had a habit of wrapping my hair in his hands, but I knew that if he touched my hair, I wouldn’t be able to wear it down for dinner.The blowjob only took a few minutes. The taboo nature of having intercourse in his office always had him on the edge, ready to burst, so this was actually my favorite place to give him one. At home, he was a different beast and loved to edge me for hours before giving in and delivering mind-blowing orgasms. The glint in his eyes as he tucked his shaft back into his pants warned that he was just getting started.“Just wait till we get home Mel. I’m going to make you beg and then I’m going to make you scream.” He growled as he tugged me to my feet and smashed his lips against mine in a rough pecking.“Promise?” I panted.“You’re killing me,” he stared into my eyes and grabbed my butt. I brought my lips to his ear and gave a little nip before I spoke.“I’m starving.” I whispered.“I just fed you.” He smirked.“For food.” I playfully scowled, and he laughed......Melanie“Melanie, I’m going to be late again tonight.” Ben sounded distracted as he called for the second time this week to let me know that he wouldn’t be home for dinner.“Oh no, do you want me to bring dinner to you?” I looked at the time and saw that it was only two p.m. “Have you had lunch?”“I’m fine baby, thank you for thinking of me.” I could hear the smile in his voice. “I’ll have something delivered.”“Alright, be safe.” I sighed.“I’m sorry.” He groaned.“It’s okay,” I said softly. I didn’t want to make him feel bad about having to work late, but I did hate eating alone at night. “I’ll see if Cassie is available, I added. Cassie was married to one of the guys that Ben golfed with. He worked for the same company but in a different department.“Uh, yeah that’s a good idea.” Ben mumbled. “Sorry, I’ve gotta go. Don’t wait up.”He ended the call without waiting for me to reply, and I stared at the phone, surprised. Before I could even put it down, my phone dinged.Hubby: I love you.Me: More today.I waited a moment to see if he would reply, but the text was left unread. His next meeting must’ve already started.....MelanieI woke up to the sound of my husband cursing quietly when he bumped into the dresser.“Ben? What time is it?” I mumbled and sat up slowly.“It’s late.” He slurred, “Did you move the dresser?”“What?” I giggled.“The dresser… it moved.”“Are you drunk?” I scowled.Plastered with a client?I checked the time.“Ben! It’s two o’clock in the morning!”“Go back to sleep.” He stripped off his jacket and pants, left them in a pile on the floor, and stumbled into the bathroom. The shower kicked on a few seconds later, and I stared at the closed door with confusion.His phone started ringing in his pocket, and I climbed out of bed to silence it.Incoming Call: Peter-Work.Why is his boss calling him from work at 2 a.m.?“Hello?” I answered quietly.“Oh, uhm is Mr. Landon there?” a woman asked.“Who is this?” I narrowed my eyes at the bathroom door.“This is Ms. Reed, I’m just calling to make sure that Mr. Landon made it home safely. The clients kept everyone very late tonight and Benji-Benjamin had quite a few drinks.” She giggled.“I’m aware. This is his wife. He’s home, thank you for checking. I will make sure the let Peter know how dedicated you are to your job.” I said slowly. Something about her tone had me on edge.“No need, just doing my job.” She said quickly. “I should get going.”“Goodnight Ms. Reed.” I replied.“Goodnight, Melanie.”“Mrs. Landon…” I corrected. I didn’t know her, and it was rude for her to assume she could call me by my first name.“Of course.”The water shut off just as I ended the call, and I dropped his phone back on top of his discarded pants. It was only a few moments later before Ben stumbled back into the bedroom, undressed and still glistening with water.“Ben, why is Peter’s secretary calling you at 2 a.m.?”“What?” he spun around and looked at me.“Peter’s secretary… just called you from the office.”“That’s… she probably just wanted to make sure I got home.” He opened a drawer and pulled out a pair of boxers.“She said that the clients kept you… Since when do you get drunk with clients?” I climbed back under the blankets and watched him. The muscles in his back tensed, and he didn’t answer right away.“Melanie, can we talk in the morning?” He finally asked and turned to look at me. He looked exhausted. He bent down and grabbed his phone on his way to bed.“I… I’m upset.” I admitted. This was entirely new territory for me. Ben had never come home drunk like this before.“I’m sorry.” He groaned and plugged his phone in before flopping down on the bed.“I don’t need an apology I just want to understand…”“Tomorrow.” He snapped, and his phone vibrated on the table. He glanced at the screen and scoffed before swiping away at it. “I can’t handle this conversation right now.” He rolled away from me.“Okay…” I whispered, stunned by his attitude......BenI screwed up.That was all I could think to myself when I woke up in the morning and saw puffy, red-rimmed eyes on my beautiful wife. I knew I had made her cry the night before, even though the details were fuzzy.The night before had started out as a dinner with clients, but at some point, the clients took their leave, and then Angela and I went to a club. She was a lot of fun outside of the office; the icy exterior slipped away as soon as her hair came down and was replaced by laughter, charming smiles, and lots of dancing.I had always been careful to keep my extramarital affairs separate from work because that’s how men got caught. I had a set of strict rules I followed to protect my marriage; nothing serious, three times max, no gifts, no declarations of love, fake name when possible, and always gloved up. While I had never screwed one of my coworkers, I had found myself flirting with a few over the years. After meeting my wife, Angela started staying late at work with me, and we had carefully toed the line between flirty and inappropriate.Until last night, when I found myself stumbling home at two o’clock in the morning.I knew that Melanie hadn’t fallen for my story and that she was going to expect me to peck her butt for the next few days before she pretended to believe me. The only thing that had worked out in my favor was that I had thought to switch Angela's contact name to ‘Peter Work’ so it wouldn’t show as her personal phone, and that she had, without prompting, given me a great cover story.I hadn’t screwed her last night but there was definitely some intense making out and fondling in the alley behind the club. She was wild and uninhibited, and I knew I was going to eventually screw her.Melanie had an air of melancholy as she sat at the kitchen table drinking her coffee. She had left my mug next to the pot but hadn’t filled it because I took longer than usual to come downstairs. I needed the extra few minutes to double-check my chest and neck for any marks and to get the details of my story straight. With how fuzzy the night was, I was worried that I would contradict something I had said to her before I fell asleep.

I'm on the hunt for something special: a serious, healthy, and stable relationship. Think less ""Netflix and chill,"" more ""Netflix and build a future"" (though chilling is definitely on the menu!). My big thing? Open and honest communication and reciprocal effort/energy. If we're not feeling it, I'll be upfront, no ghosting, no breadcrumbing – just mutual respect. I expect the same from you!

So, Who Am I? I'm 34, Asian, 5'7"", and enjoying life in the Golden State. My mornings are powered by coffee (sometimes the afternoons too, don't judge!), and while I might start a bit socially awkward, give me a minute. I promise I can hold a conversation like a champ once I get warmed up.

* Day Job: I tackle IT challenges for a hotel management company. Basically, I make sure the digital world plays nice so everyone else can enjoy their vacations.
* Homebody (with an outdoor streak): You'll often find me nesting at home with my hobbies, but I definitely ""touch grass."" Think swimming, snorkeling, or even a competitive game of mini-golf or pickleball!
* Gaming Life: Huge fan of video games, especially co-op ones. Playing with others is seriously way more fun.
* Entertainment Obsessed: My watch list is probably longer than my arm. Movies, TV shows, anime – if it's got a great story, I'm probably watching it.
* Reading: I dive into manga, manhwa, and light novels. Got any recommendations?
* Pokémon Picks: Snorlax is my undisputed favorite, with Psyduck and Gengar tied for second. Who are your faves?
* Animal Lover: Obsessed with all animals, especially marine life (Orca overlords, when?!).
* Fun Fact: My favorite animal is a sloth. Did you know these slowpokes are surprisingly amazing swimmers?
* Mind Matters: I'm really interested in psychology. What makes people tick? Let's discuss!
* Travel Bug: Diagnosed with a severe case of wanderlust! I've explored Mexico, Japan, Thailand, and Canada, and my bucket list is constantly growing.
* Foodie Adventures: I'd absolutely travel just for the food. Food tourism, anyone? My taste buds are ready for adventure.
* My Vices (or lack thereof): Never smoked, and I only drink occasionally for social events.
* Beliefs: I'm an atheist.
* Personality Bits: I'm a Leo, an INFP, an overthinker, and a big-time texter. I'm genuinely curious about your passions and what makes you smile!

What I'm Hoping to Find in You:

* Non-smoker, and doesn’t do drugs
* Caring, accepting, respectful, compassionate, and emotionally intelligent – basically, a good human!
* Open and direct communication/intentions – let's keep it real.
* Consistency – showing up is important.
* Shares some common interests (but also excited to introduce me to new things!)
* Child-free

Ideally, you'd be somewhere in the US, and the closer to the West Coast, the better, but I'm open to seeing where things lead! Once we're comfy chatting via text, I'd love to jump on Discord for voice or video chats.

1mii79q,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Mr_Rellim/comments/1mii79q/cann_naked_hi_boy_review_the_stealth_mvp_of_thc/,Cann Naked Hi Boy Review: The Stealth MVP of THC Drinks,"I’ve tried just about every THC beverage format—cans, enhancers, powders, [apéritifs](https://go.shopmy.us/p-22459205), you name it—but [Cann’s](https://go.shopmy.us/p-22459290) Naked Hi Boy stands out as one of the most practical and flexible infused products on the market right now. It’s unflavored, undetectable, and reliable. Here’s my full breakdown.

What Is It?

[Naked Hi Boy](https://go.shopmy.us/p-22459162) is a flavorless THC liquid sachet from Cann’s Hi Boy line. Each pouch contains 5mg of THC, with no CBD, and zero sugar, zero calories, and zero additives. You get a box of 12 single-serve sachets per purchase, and the price point is \~$55 for a 12-pack.

Unlike Cann’s mainline social tonics (2mg THC + 4mg CBD), this one’s just THC, and it’s built for stacking, mixing, and infusing into literally anything—coffee, smoothies, soda, kombucha, mocktails, or whatever you’re drinking.

Formulation & Experience

The liquid integrates almost instantly. There’s no flavor, no bitterness, no trace of weediness, and no texture disruption. That’s a huge win. I’ve tried other drink enhancers that leave behind a noticeable film or off-taste. This one? Truly invisible.

The onset is about 15–20 minutes for me. 

I’ve used it:

In a citrus Spindrift → perfect mocktail hour buzz

In cold brew on a hot day → nice combo of alert + light high

In hot tea at night → subtle and relaxing

In plain water → still works, just not exciting

The effect feels clean, cerebral, and light. You’ll get the floaty high of 5mg without a crash. It’s not couch-lock material. Just enough to shift your mood, make music sound better, or spark some mid-day creativity.

Use Case: This Is a Utility Product

This is about control and versatility. Cann’s tonics are great when you want a flavor-forward, ready-to-drink experience. But Naked Hi Boy is for people who want:

Custom flavors (you bring the beverage)

Precision dosing

Zero sugar or calories

Portability (fits in a pocket)

Discretion (no smell, no can)

Honestly, this is one of the best options for cannabis consumers who care more about effect and experience than flavor branding. It’s also ideal for people on keto, low-sugar diets, or those avoiding additives

|Product|Format|THC|CBD|Sugar|Flavor|Best For|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cann Tonics|RTD|2mg|4mg|\~4g|Multiple|Low-dose social sipping|
|Hi Boy|RTD|5mg|0mg|\~5g|Same flavors|Higher tolerance / deeper buzz|
|Roadies|Liquid shot|2mg|4mg|0g|Same as tonics|Portability|
|Naked Hi Boy|Powder|5mg|0mg|0g|None|Full customization|

[Naked Hi Boy](https://go.shopmy.us/p-22459162) gives you the most control per mg in the Cann lineup. You can infuse a LaCroix or build a complex mocktail without fighting the taste of the base product. That’s huge for anyone who prefers functional cannabis without sweeteners.

Cons

Price per mg is high compared to gummies or syrups

No CBD, so not ideal for people who want that balance

Not designed for flavor lovers—this is a utility play, not a sensory one

Not water-soluble in every drink—some thicker drinks take more stirring

Final Verdict

If you’re looking for a clean, flexible way to consume THC that doesn’t require sugar, artificial flavors, or committing to a single taste, Cann Naked Hi Boy is a top-tier product.

It’s not meant to compete with fancy mocktails—it’s meant to fit into your life, your flavor preferences, and your routines. Whether you’re building a functional drink routine or looking for something discreet to travel with, this one delivers. I’ll keep these stocked alongside my coffee and sparkling water.

Rating: 9.2/10

– Docked slightly for price and lack of CBD, but otherwise nearly flawless in form and function.",1,1754420757.0,u_Mr_Rellim,0,1.0,False

I have created a small little app that takes your generated album and adds it to a playlist ""Todays album"" and adds the playlist to your Spotify account after you accept the app towards Spotify.

I made it because every morning i want to have a cup of coffee and play todays album without having to look it up. So i can just tell my smart speaker: ""Hey Google, play todays album"". The possibilities are endless, you could have an wake up alarm that plays the playlist (even though i can't imagine the horror of waking up to Spy vs Spy by John Zorn).

The link is here:

Just enter your username from the albumgenerator and accept communication with Spotify and you should be good to go.

After the playlist have been created and populated you can rename it if you want. You still have to rate the album in the same way as before but the playlist get updated everyday, regardless if you voted or not.

But I’ve *NEVER* had a dog who loved me so much. All he wants to do is be with me, all I have to do is look at him and his “nubbin” tail starts wagging. I’m never alone anymore, I don’t even have to pee alone lol!

July 25 2025-August 04 2025","I will try to keep this fairly brief, but feel free to ask questions. This reddit was very helpful to me during the planning of our trip and I'd like to help others if I can!

My family visited Newfoundland 25 years ago (when I was a teenager) and we decided to return to celebrate. Our trip was 8 adults and 2 children (ages 3 and 7). Overall, we had a great time, but 3 year old's on trips are something else!

25 years ago we drove from Pennsylvania to NL, this time we flew, everyone came from all over the East Coast US, but we all arrived in St. John's and had no problems with Air Canada at any point, everything was on time, and no lost luggage. Their website sucks, but otherwise great.

We picked up a rental SUV from Budget and a Mini Van from Turo, we got ours from Dennis, and he was great to work with.

We headed to Comerford's in Holyrood for our Avalon Leg. We stayed here 25 years ago as well, and they are great! The cottages are lovely. I hope they are still around if we visit again in another 25 years!

Day 1: Breakfast at the Irish Loop Coffee House, great, we took up a lot of space, but they were lovely. Whale Watching with Molly Bawn, Mobile Bay...we didn't see any whales (which was disappointing), but we saw lots of birds (including many puffins!) and our guide was very nice. They don't control the whales obviously, but whale watching was #1 on our list, and this was a sad start (especially for what you pay). We also had plans for Lunch at Ferryland Picnics, but the weather was yucky, so we moved it to the next day and instead went back to St. John's and had lunch at Qudi Vidi Wharf, it was raining, but it was fine. We tried the brewery, but it was a long wait. Then we went to the Johnson Geo Centre (for an inside activity), and the kids loved it! It is a neat place, even if I didn't learn munch chasing the 3 year old. Check out the Newfoundland and Labrador dog statues at the top of the hill. My three year old loves dogs and this was a highlight.

Day 2: Had to flip flop our days because of the weather, which led to more driving, but some driving is going to be most NL trips! Four of us woke up early to head to Cape Spear for sunrise, it was chilly and windy, but awesome! We then hung around and walked around St. John's looking at all the cute houses and churches. We met the rest of our group for breakfast at Terre, and that was very good. Then we headed to Signal Hill, which had a local craft fair going on, we bought many crafts! Signal hill itself was quite crowded but we walked around and it was nice. We then headed to Ferryland for our picnic lunch. We saw quite a few whales splashing around in the water during our time there, which was very nice! The picnic food was great. We ended with some ice cream snacks and a walk on the ""beach"" in Holyrood.

Day 3: More of a chill day, we visited Salmonier Nature Park. I had heard mixed reviews of this, but it was awesome! The nature center is beautiful and great for kids and the trail and animals were very nice. We saw the fisher chase a real squirrel up the trees. We didn't see the Moose, which was a theme of the trip. It was also free! We then played at a park in Holyrood. Then a group of us when back to Bay Bulls to try some whale watching again. We are a fan of the smaller boats, so we saw ""Captain Wayne's Marine Excursions"" on the map and sought him out. When we arrived it was clear Captain Wayne's was no longer in operation. We considered O'Brien's or Gatherall's, but they are both bigger ships. So we decided to stop at a small art shop and see if they had any recommendations. Turns out, the artist was Captain Wayne himself! He stopped doing excursions during the pandemic. We went and bought some beers, he shared some screech and we chatted with Captain Wayne for a good while, a highlight of the trip! But we never made it out whale watching. The plan was to eat at Dildo brewing for dinner, but they don't take reservations, and it was an hour wait! So we went down the street to Dildo Boathouse and it was great! Right on the water and they were able to accommodate us immediately. Visiting Dildo was also on the ""must do list"" after seeing signs on our last trip.

Day 4: Travel day to Fortune for the Ferry to St. Pierre et Miquelon. This was on our bucket list from our first trip, but since it is such a drive to Fortune it didn't make the cut, so we made it a priority this time. I'm glad we did it, but we probably didn't need two full days. They just don't feel ""set-up"" for tourists, especially American tourists (which is fine, they can do what they want). Many things were closed ""for the season"" (at the end of July) and most places closed 12-2pm and 5-7pm. That said, the food we ate here was definitely out favorite of the trip. Had Feu de Briase the first night, and it was delicious. We stayed at Hotel Robert, which was fine, they don't have air conditioning or even fans. We ate at the Crepes/Food Cart next to the SPM tourism office for lunch, don't recommend.

Day 5: We got amazing pastries every morning from Bakery David Girardin. They were amazing. This morning we walked to the the overlook over the city. It is quite the hike, and the view would have been nicer if it wasn't so foggy. In the afternoon we did a tour of Sailor's Island. It was nice, but my kids were crazy so I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have. This night we ate at Bar a Quai, which was also very good.

Day 6: We took the Ferry to Miquelon, and the weather was lovely. We walked to Les Saveurs Fermières, the goat dairy. We had made a reservation, but came in right behind a large-ish French speaking tour bus. So our ""tour"" was in French, but then we got to meet the goats, which my kids absolutely loved! Then once the tour cleared out we got the ""cheese plate"" lunch outside, which was absolutely amazing (if you like goat cheese and baguette and wine). We also bought some goat soap. We then headed back to town and went to the Nature center (after a short break on the rock beach to wait until 2pm when they opened again), which was also very nice and great for kids. We then did some shopping and took the Ferry back to St. Pierre. I think we liked Miquelon better than St. Pierre. We got some Ice Cream at Le Glacier when they ""reopened"" at 8pm. We also walked to the one pond and saw donkeys, horses and ducks.

Day 7: Another travel day back to Fortune (we left our cars at Helen Drake Parking, which was nice and painless), and drove to our Airbnb in the town of Terra Nova by the national park. We did a detour to Smuggler's Cove in Burin for lunch, it was super cute and wish we could have stayed longer, I think (or hope) it is livelier in the evening/dinner time. We had to hurry because my husband and I were headed to Gander that evening to see Come From Away at the community theater. It was amazing! So fun to see in the place where it happened. I wish we could have spent more time in Gander. Next time! We had not seen the show before this. The best part was the local who shares of story about how they helped during the that time at the start of the show. Had me crying.

Day 8: Captain Wayne had suggested Sea of Whales out of Trinity for whale watching, but online it looked like they were booked for the day (last minute), but I decided to call, and since we were a big group (8) they were able to get another boat out in the morning! It was amazing! The water was like glass and we saw close to 15+ whales. A large group of them were feeding together in what our guide (Shawna, who was awesome) could assume was a bait ball situation. We also saw moms with babies and lots and lots of birds. This made up for the misses earlier in the trip! Trinity is adorable! I wish we would have stayed there, but it would have added more drive time to other areas of our trip. Next time! We had lunch at the Dock Marina, which was nice, and my Dad finally tried Cod Tongue, something else he felt he missed out on 25 years ago! We then travelled north to Elliston Point to see the Puffins, although a bit crowded, it was a magical experience. Could have stayed longer, but a 3 year old does not allow for it. We enjoyed some root cellars and got light dinner/dessert at Nanny's Root Cellar Kitchen, which was very nice.

Day 9: Another more relaxing day visiting Terra Nova national park. We went to the visitors center and did one of their kids activities at the campground. We then visited the Ochre Hill Observation tower. After we headed back to Terra Nova for the kids to swim in the swimming pond, which they absolutely loved. We had dinner at the Clode Sound Motel/Restaurant, which was okay. After dinner we went on a short hike to the SouthWest Arm to look for the resident beaver, and we spotted him and a loon! We then rushed to the Newman Sound Campground Outdoor Theater to catch ""When Hairy Met Patchy"" which was cute for the kids.

Day 10: Returned to St. John's for our flights without a hitch! Still with not a single Moose sighting.

I don't know if we'll every return to Newfoundland, but I'm already planning the trip when we're ready! And the weather was mostly incredible! Returning to the hot and humid Mid-Atlantic was a buzz kill!",6,1754420714.0,newfoundland,1,0.88,False

I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for a place in Brighton & Hove where you can grab a coffee (or even a light bite) in the evenings, especially after 6 or 7 pm.

I enjoy going out for a coffee instead of heading to a pub, but I’ve found that many cafés tend to close quite early. So I’d love to hear if there are any later-opening places you know of — maybe hidden gems, dessert spots, or chilled café-bars that serve decent coffee.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions, really appreciate it!",0,1754420679.0,brighton,3,0.5,False

Dishoom Birmingham feels like stepping into a stylish Bombay café with its clever 1930s-inspired decor, showcasing vintage paraphernalia that tells a story and creates a cozy yet vibrant atmosphere. Seating is comfortably spaced, offering privacy without losing the buzz, and the staff are consistently praised for being warm, attentive, and knowledgeable, which makes the service feel genuinely personal. The lighting strikes a nice balance—not too bright, not too dim—perfect for relaxed lunches or intimate dinners.  Food-wise, the quality is clearly a highlight. Dishes like the buttery maska buns with hot chai, masala prawns, pau bhaji, and the Goan monkfish curry are often singled out for their fresh ingredients, bold yet balanced spices, and thoughtful presentation. Portions are moderate, ideal for tasting multiple plates rather than large single servings. Some guests note occasional small inconsistencies in flavor, but overall the food hits a high standard with delicious, authentic tastes.  Pricing sits firmly in the mid-range but feels fair given the quality and ambiance. Dishoom is popular, so booking ahead is wise, especially for evenings and weekends; quieter weekday lunches offer a more laid-back experience. It’s a great spot for couples, families, or groups looking for a lively yet comfortable place to gather, and it doubles as a community hub with its café vibe and excellent coffee options.  The buzz around Dishoom Birmingham remains strong thanks to its social media presence and consistent delivery of a unique Bombay café experience in the heart of the city. Its blend of creative cocktails, vibrant Indian flavors, and welcoming vibe keeps locals and visitors coming back. While some compare it to other local Indian eateries with varied opinions, Dishoom’s polished atmosphere, attentive staff, and signature dishes maintain its position as Birmingham’s top-ranked Indian-inspired restaurant. If you want a spot that feels both special and unpretentious, it’s definitely worth a visit.

Indian Cafe Racer in Birmingham is a bit of a hidden treasure that surprises you from the moment you step inside. The restaurant is housed in a Grade II listed pub with a cozy, intimate vibe that contrasts with its unassuming exterior. Inside, the décor is unique and charming—highlighted by a Royal Enfield motorbike centerpiece and a jazzy, late-60s Indian fusion soundtrack, which together create a cool, laid-back atmosphere. The seating is comfortable but the space is compact, and it can get lively and noisy when busy, adding to the buzz rather than detracting from the experience. Staff are friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable, offering a relaxed but polished service style that feels personal and welcoming[2][4].  The food is the real star here, earning the restaurant an almost perfect 4.9-star rating from over 500 reviews. Signature dishes like the slow-cooked Rajastani lamb, Chicken Chettinad, and the innovative Broccoli 65 stand out for their complex layering of spices and refined execution. The ingredients are top-notch, and every dish is beautifully presented, reflecting meticulous preparation techniques that elevate typical Indian fare to something more elegant and flavorful. Portions tend to be mid-sized, leaning towards smaller, which some diners find a bit pricey but most agree suits sharing and tasting multiple dishes. Avoid the masala fries takeaway, which has been noted for sogginess and not matching expectations[1][2][5].  Pricing is mid-range but on the higher side given portion size, positioning Indian Cafe Racer as a special occasion or treat rather than a casual curry house. Reservations are recommended, especially on weekends when it fills up quickly. The vibe suits couples looking for a date night, small groups of friends, or anyone wanting a sophisticated Indian dining experience away from the usual. The restaurant has gained recent popularity through word of mouth and social media buzz, with food bloggers and local diners praising its quality and distinct character. Its ""hidden gem"" status seems to be fading as more locals and visitors discover it, so best to visit soon before it gets too busy[1][2][3][4].  In short, if you’re after Indian food that’s more refined, complex, and thoughtfully crafted than the average spot—and don’t mind paying a bit extra for a memorable meal in a unique setting—Indian Cafe Racer is a must-try in Birmingham. Just make sure to book ahead and come hungry to sample several of their standout dishes.

Just go hungry and ready for a lively night out!

If you’re thinking about Decorum in Birmingham, here’s the real scoop from local buzz and recent reviews. The place nails it on atmosphere—the interior is absolutely stunning, elegant and modern with a vibe that’s perfect for special occasions or a stylish night out. The lighting and decor create a warm but sophisticated feel, and the staff are generally praised for being friendly and attentive, which makes the whole dining experience feel welcoming and polished[1][3].  On the food front, people seem divided. The lamb shank and ribeye steak often get glowing mentions for tenderness and flavor, showing that some signature dishes really deliver. Preparation uses quality ingredients, and presentation is on point, although some diners find the pace of service slow when the restaurant is busy. On the downside, a few reviews note inconsistency—some dishes fall short of expectations and can feel just “average,” especially given the mid-range pricing[2][5]. Portions are decent but not overwhelming, fitting the fine-dining style.  Prices hover in the mid-range category, which feels fair if you get the well-executed steaks or lamb. It’s advisable to book ahead, especially on weekends, since it’s a popular spot and tables fill up fast. The venue suits couples celebrating birthdays or anniversaries, groups wanting a classy atmosphere, and even families thanks to private dining options[3][5]. Quiet weekday evenings might offer the best balance of attentive service and calm ambiance.  The hype right now comes from its Instagram-worthy aesthetics and live music events that add a lively touch to the dining experience. Social media loves Decorum for its look and vibe, even if opinions on the food are mixed. Locals seem loyal though, treating it as a hidden gem for special occasions rather than casual dining[1][4]. If you want a memorable night out with beautiful surroundings and solid steaks, it’s worth giving Decorum a try—but maybe don’t expect every dish to be flawless.

1mii5pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1mii5pv/why_do_lectures_always_make_me_sleepy_even_when_i/,Why do lectures always make me sleepy even when I am not tired,I can wake up feeling fully rested even have a coffee or energy drink before class and still the moment the lecture starts I feel like I am about to pass out. It does not matter if it is eight in the morning or three in the afternoon. As soon as I sit down and the professor starts going through slides in that slow calm voice my brain just checks out. It is actually annoying because I will feel fine and alert before class but as soon as the lecture begins it is like my body gets the signal to shut down. My eyes get heavy I start yawning nonstop and it takes every bit of effort just to stay focused. And this happens even when the topic is something I find interesting. I do not think it is about being bored either. I can watch a two hour movie or listen to a podcast and stay totally engaged. But put me in a classroom with someone talking at me for forty minutes and I am fighting sleep like I have not rested in days. It probably has something to do with just sitting still for too long in a quiet room with low energy. No interaction no movement just listening and taking notes. My brain just kind of melts into a fog where I am not really processing anything. The weird part is I do not feel this way in more hands on classes or when there is a discussion going. I think it is just the old school lecture format that does this to me. It is like my brain decided a long time ago that lectures mean nap time no matter what. I want to actually take in the material and stay alert but I swear something about the whole setup just works against me. Has anyone else dealt with this or figured out how to push through it without needing three cups of coffee and chewing gum every five seconds to stay awake. If you have any weird tricks or habits that help you focus during long lectures I am all ears because I cannot keep walking out of class wondering what was even said the past hour.,17,1754420662.0,college,2,1.0,False
1mii4zb,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mii4zb/ro_another_afternoon_with_you/,[RO] Another Afternoon with You,"I was lying on the couch, sinking lazily into the cushions with my mind feeling too tired to wander, content to merely remain disengaged. An overturned book lay on the coffee table, saving a page I kept telling myself I'd get to, but for whatever reason never did. The television rambled on with typical sitcom scenarios from a show I've seen countless times, the odd, nostalgic comfort serving as a makeshift cure for the option paralysis that comes with online streaming.

My idle brain stirs awake when I hear the key fiddling in the lock, and with Pavlovian response time my face brightens up and my eyes dart to the doorway, knowing that you're about to step inside. It always makes me feel like an excited puppy when you get home, like everything springs to life, the colors brighten, the air becomes electric. The door opens and in with the golden daylight comes you, looking as radiant as ever, the flicker of joy in your eyes from seeing me matching my own from seeing you. ""Heyyy,"" you say with a smile as you plop your bag on the corner table and shut the door behind you.

I realize what I must look like, a lump of lethargy languishing about. ""I'm sorry,"" I say, suddenly embarrassed. ""I don't think I got up once since you left."" I feel sheepish about this, having wanted to spend my day off in a productive manner, yet here I am wasting a lovely afternoon. But you won't have it - you never let me speak ill of myself, not for a moment. You've always been wonderful like that.

You shoot me such an empathetic, loving look as you slowly saunter over to me across the living room. ""Babe, you had a long week,"" you assure me. ""It's okay, you're allowed to have a lazy day."" I could feel the dreaminess in my eyes as you came over and got onto the couch, straddling me with a mischievous smile. I could look at you forever, especially like this. The way those beautiful locks hang freely, reaching down to tickle my cheeks as you lower your face to meet mine. Your eyes, the way they transmit such warmth; your gaze alone makes me feel so lucky, so loved.

I feel the smile broaden across my face as I close my eyes and feel your lips reach mine, as your delicate fingers slide up my chest, as I instinctively wrap my arms around you and pull you into me. Your scent overtakes me, the intoxicating blend of your shampoo and perfume reducing me to a puddle beneath you as I feel you nuzzle into me so affectionately. The blabbing television and the half-read book and the rest of my trite existence melt away in your soft, warm embrace. This is the way to spend the afternoon, I think. Snuggling and kissing and giggling with you on the couch. 

That's when I open my eyes and sit up, looking around my empty apartment, and I remember that you don't exist.",1,1754420616.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1mii38l,https://i.redd.it/1zn3zk8x09hf1.png,🎀 MEIDO ARENA – Excerpts from the Arena #9: Pure Service,"
Belfast (Azur Lane) 🇬🇧 

vs 

Meido Mei (The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You) ☕


Announcer: Distinguished guests, today we will not speak of war, but of simplicity. Today, patience, grace, and consideration will triumph! To the question ""tea or coffee?"", today we say yes. Our theme today is pure service. Two maid masters, in this episode, will speak only of service!
Slogan: Service is service.


🎭 Arena Theme: The Modern Palace Complex
We are not in the classic Meido Arena. In this episode, the ground is replaced by a modern palace complex, designed with minimalist lines, spacious and bright. The area is surrounded by gleaming glass walls and white marble columns. In the center, a perfectly arranged hall is set up for the two maids to showcase their serving skills. The audience can watch the entire process in intricate detail from high glass balconies.


👤 Character Introductions

🇬🇧 Belfast (Azur Lane)

The embodiment of grace and perfection. In her black and white maid outfit, her every move is filled with the elegance of a ballerina. She doesn't just serve; she thinks ahead, anticipating her guest's every desire. Her expression is always serene, and her eyes shine with an understanding as tranquil as the ocean's depth. Her service is the purest reflection of English nobility and tradition. In her hand, a silver tea tray is the greatest symbol of her art of service.


☕ Meido Mei (The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You)

A vibrant and dynamic ball of energy. In her sweet and charming maid outfit, she is always ready to smile. She sees service not as an art form, but as an expression of love. Her skill goes beyond memorized rules, shaped by genuine interest and affection. Every coffee she prepares is filled with energy from the heart. Her eyes reflect the deep devotion she feels for the person she serves. The patterned coffee cup in her hand is the greatest indicator of her service full of love.


🎬 The Service Begins
With the sound of a bell, they both moved at the same time. There was no clash of swords or burst of magic; only a synchronized dance of two different philosophies of service. Belfast's every step was like a planned choreography. The way she carried her silver tray, held the teapot, and placed the cup was so flawless that time seemed to stand still. With a single glance, she understood the exact temperature and brewing time of her guest's favorite tea. Her service was all about tradition and perfection.
Meido Mei, on the other hand, infused every movement with joy. The cheerful sounds of her grinding coffee beans, the heart-shaped foam art she created on the cup, and her heartfelt smile filled the space with warmth. She knew what her guest needed in that moment, sensing it just by being near them. Her service was a reflection of pure love and sincerity. Both of them presented a cup to their guest at the same time: one a cup of tea carrying the elegant scent of perfection, the other a cup of coffee carrying the warmth of sincerity.
The service continues even if the master doesn't ask for anything, the result is uncertain.


Now It's Your Turn, Reader!

Who do you think won?
 * Tradition and perfection, or sincerity and heartfeltness?

This is very classy coming from her, considering when I lived at home she made sure to let everyone know, 24/7, at the top of her lungs, how miserable she is. Every single day saying how much she hates her job. She would constantly leave us only with low-effort food like fast food pizza or just buttered toast because she ""didn't want to cook"". She constantly cancels plans with me because she changes her mind and doesn't want to go.

There isn't a single ""friend"" of hers I haven't heard her shit talk behind their back. She lives off of shit talking people that aren't in her vicinity. Shit, even people that ARE in her vicinity. She likes to insult my stepdad's family literally right in front of him (Amusing too, because it's one of the only moments my EStepdad doesn't enable her and that's too much even for him, because he actually snaps back at her. lmao) She used to regularly hang out and go get coffee with my homeroom teacher back in middle school to the point I thought they were friends. Years later, she admits in passing that she was just pretending ""for my sake"" (I have no idea what  that meant) and never actually liked my teacher.

Yet somehow, according to her, I am someone who ""never has anything nice to say about anyone"", who is just ""pretending"" and that is ""always talking badly about everyone"". She liked to tell me how no one knows me like she knows me and that none of my friends would like me, if they knew ""what I was really like"". Weird, because I knew my best friend as someone with more self-respect than that. My best friend was someone who had a notoriously short fuse with fake assholes. If I was one, she would have definitely let me know. But Nmom has always thought she knows everything about me and my friendships, when it couldn't be further from the truth. Plus, I generally considers myself a pretty chill and laidback person to be friends with. I don't like causing drama, I don't like getting involved in drama. I'm certainly way too browbeaten from my childhood to be going out of my way to be intentionally instigating conflict with people. If anything, I generally shut down and internalize everything if I have issues with someone or something. She is a rage monster, we are nothing alike in our approach to things like dislike and anger.

You gotta love N-talk. Every accusation is a confession. How about y'all? What would you say is the most ironic shit coming out of your Ns mouths?",2,1754420488.0,raisedbynarcissists,3,1.0,False
1mii1wi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mii1wi/uncover_if_the_cuisinart_prc12n_percolator_makes/,Uncover If the Cuisinart PRC-12N Percolator Makes the Best Coffee,"Cuisinart PRC-12N has been my go-to coffee companion for the past couple of weeks, and brewing coffee feels like a ritual now, thanks to its classic stainless steel design and functionality. There's something nostalgic about the sound of hot water bubbling through the coffee grounds that sets the tone for my mornings. The removable basket with measurement markings simplifies the brewing process, leaving little room for error. But before you get too excited, let's explore the highs and lows I've experienced with this percolator.

**Ergonomic and Eye-Catching Design**  
The stainless steel construction immediately gives off a classy vibe and feels robust enough to withstand daily wear and tear. Its modest dimensions (6.25"" D x 9.25"" W x 12.25"" H) make it compact enough to sit on my kitchen counter without hogging too much space. Pouring coffee is a breeze, thanks to the ergonomic handle coupled with a knuckle guard, ensuring no accidental burns. The long, tapered no-drip spout deserves special mention — it truly prevents messy spills, something my clumsy self truly appreciates.

**Simple Yet Engaging Operation**  
As someone who occasionally struggles with overly complicated gadgets, the manual operation mode of this coffee maker feels refreshingly straightforward. All you need to do is add your coffee grounds to the reusable filter basket, pour water, and flip the switch to brew. Watching the progress through the transparent knob is oddly satisfying, almost meditative. However, unlike modern programmable coffee makers, you have to be present to turn it off once the cycle is complete.  

**Convenient Brewing Capacity**  
The versatility of brewing anywhere from 4 to 12 cups makes this an excellent choice for solo coffee drinkers and larger gatherings alike. Whether it's a quiet morning with one cup for myself or a weekend brunch with friends, this percolator rises to the occasion. The markings on the removable basket eliminate the guesswork about how much coffee to use for the number of cups you’re brewing.

**Key Benefits**  
- Durable stainless steel housing gives it a premium finish.  
- Transparent knob lets you monitor the brewing progress.  
- Spill-proof design with a precise no-drip spout.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Requires manual attention to switch off after brewing.  
- The stainless steel surface, while attractive, tends to show fingerprints.  
- It would’ve been nice to see some modern touches like a programmable timer.  

**Rival Brands**  
When compared to the Farberware Yosemite Percolator, there's a trade-off between tradition and simplicity. The Cuisinart PRC-12N's stainless steel housing feels more durable, yet the Farberware model edges slightly in terms of ease with automatic shutoff functionality. Another comparable product would be the Presto Electric Percolator, which boasts slightly faster brewing times but lacks the classy aesthetic of the Cuisinart. Where this product confidently outshines its competitors is the practicality of its features – the drip-free spout and ergonomic handle make it a favorite in busy households.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Though the Cuisinart PRC-12N might not be the cheapest coffee maker out there, it certainly gives you solid value for its price. You're essentially paying for its durability, a hands-on coffee-making experience, and the little joys of its thoughtful design. In the long run, its reusable filter and sturdy build add to its cost-effectiveness, as you won’t be running to replace it anytime soon.

I have no motivation and spend hours pointlessly obsessing over money and doomscrolling.

In the meantime, I'm committed to creating a happy life. Nothing fancy, I will commit to the following healthy habits:

\- Limit caffeine intake to one cup of coffee a day  
\- Limit screen time; delete social media -- replace this with reading  
\- Keep my space tidy -- commit to 20 minutes of cleaning every day   
\- Intentionally connect with someone once a week  
\- Get back into boxing 3x/week  
\- Get back into eating healthy (I will get lab work before and after as I'm prediabetic)  
\- Get a financial planner (I have an appointment set up in 2 weeks)  
\- Checking up on finances once a week (I tend to obsess rather than set goals and relax)

1mihypt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mihypt/im_having_a_hard_time_forgiving_and_moving_on/,I'm having a hard time forgiving and moving on from my ex/best friend,"This is going to be a long one, but I thank whoever reads this. For context, I'm 22 and this takes place two years ago, almost to the day. I haven't had many relationships, I've had a few but all were long distance. I had one talking stage that lived very close but that was short lived.

When I was 20 there was this girl I knew from a Christian music camp that I was just mutuals with and we shared some friends and a groupchat from camp. I knew her for about 4 years but never got close. Well when she became single and I was also not talking to anyone we started to flirt a little in the group chat and then also dm's. We started texting a bit more and then I asked her to watch a movie over discord. She was thrilled and very excited and the night came and we called and instead of watching a movie we just talked, and talked, and talked for hours. We clicked, man we clicked so hard. We had such similar humor, taste in music, beliefs, values, just everything. The whole nine yards. I remember her asking me ""OP, why are you single?"" After that night it became routine to start calling at night before bed and turned into sleeping on call. In the past during this stage I would have slight thoughts and worries of them talking to other guys or not being completely honest. Maybe it was insecurities, maybe it was just the morbid thoughts of what can happen long distance and stuff, but with her those thoughts never even came up in my mind. There was no doubt at all. I was falling in love with this girl. I did what I thought I'd never do and that was play guitar and sing songs for her even though I definitely can't sing well. 

The talk of her visiting came up and it was only a few days till she decided yes she wanted to and was willing to visit me. I paid for the flight and she stayed at my house with me. To this day, that was the best week of my life. I have never been happier. We had dinner, went to Spirit Halloween, I surprised her with an aquarium visit before taking her to see one of our favorite bands at a concert, took her pumpkin picking, malls, coffee, the zoo. We shared our first kiss, ""I love you,"" and we got a little intimate. We didn't have sex, but we did oral and hand stuff. (These details are important for later). We shared a lot of firsts together. She was nearly my first kiss, first dance, first makeout, the more intimate stuff, sharing a bed, many things. Before this trip she told me she was kinda weird with physical touch, she'd get tired of it easily and wouldn't wanna like hold hands anymore and things like that. She also thought calling each other ""babe"" and ""baby"" was cringe and even made fun of couples that do that with her ex. But when she was with me, she did all of that. She was always touching me, she called me baby and babe, she swore she'd never do PDA but she initiated a kiss at the mall and it shocked me. You get the point. She was shocked herself how she was with me. It was incredibly special, for both of us. She told me while laying on my chest, ""Give me something to not like about you.""

She went home and then a little over a month later she visited again and it was also a great week. Went axe throwing and met some of my friends, went with my dad and stepmom to the Creation Museum, saw Christmas lights, and more. It was a more chill week staying in doors more and going a little further intimately, (Again important details for later), still no sex but we got close. We showered together and slept skin to skin. 

After the second visit she went home and things were odd. First two days were fine but then for two weeks she was distant. Acting very very depressed and not texting much and not calling at all anymore. I tried to ignore it while still caring and reaching out, she was a little depressed the first time she went home too which is understandable. After two weeks she dropped it. I got the call and she wanted to end our relationship. Her reasoning at the time was simply ""I don't feel like you're my husband. It just doesn't feel right."" And that was that. I was.....crushed. Devastated doesn't even begin to describe it. I was 20-21 years old and thought I had for sure found my wife. We had baby names planned and everything. She was perfect and we never had disagreements or anything even close. We had the love you saw in movies. So this took me by surprise and I broke. I didn't leave my house besides for work for over a month. I'd wake up constantly in the night for months having dreams of her, I've never cried more in my life. I did what everyone should not do, and I stayed friends with her. She asked for space which I was giving her right after the breakup but she was going through rough depression. She didn't want to live anymore. She's had depression since middleschool and has attempted to take her own life. She's been diagnosed with many things, it's not for attention she never wanted people to know about it. I kissed her scars on her thighs. Because of this depression it was hard to keep space because I wanted to be there for her. She called me two days after we ended because she had a bad fight with her mom and needed to talk to someone. After this I would text her a bit just trying to be there. I'd get left on read and get no responses for hours or even a whole day but she sent me a voice message one day saying thank you. That she couldn't think of anyone who would do what I've done for her especially given the circumstances. She said she can't say sorry enough for how things have been and that she hasn't been the best to me but I mean a lot to her for caring and supporting and being sweet to her during this time. 

As time went on it was a cycle. I had no closure. She'd say she still cared about me but can't promise anything, I still loved her and wanted to try and fix us and she'd get annoyed that I want to talk about it and she'd get mad and tell me to give her space and it would get ugly sometimes. I know I wasn't perfect in how I handled it, but it was extremely hard being friends with someone I loved and shared something so special with and had no closure or real reason for the relationship ending. From March to the beginning of July that year we didn't talk. She had gotten so fed up with me she just wanted nothing to do with me. Ignored my existence even in the groupchat she wouldn't react to me at all. She started to become cold to me. 

July we started talking again as friends and at the end of that month she moved for school. She was going into ministry. So she went to Bible school. I watched a livestream of her school's church and it started a revival in my faith. I had been away from church and my faith even though I still believed. I got back into church and continued watching her church's streams and texting her through out them. She was calling me nearly every day and every night on her way home from work. She was very busy between school and work so she'd pretty much only call while she was driving but I was happy we were actually really good friends again despite me fighting my feelings and dealing with that. 

There were times I may have texted her a little too much and she'd get a little annoyed and ask for space and sometimes it'd come out of nowhere, like she was mad and it was just being taken out on me. Sometimes she'd be very passive aggressive or just straight up mean in her texts to me. One night she stayed up till about 3am on a school night after work and I was like ""What are you still doing up?"" And she claimed she just can't sleep. But she'd start to not be on her phone after work (1am) until around 2 or 3am. She entirely stopped calling after work like she was every single night. Then eventually she just stopped calling all together. She then started to barely text me or respond to my texts. I asked her about it and she said it was nothing personal and she's just distant from everyone, but she was texting the groupchat as much as she used to text me at this point. I said I was worried about losing her as a friend and she said I don't have to worry about that. She started getting close to her coworker and doing all the things with him that I wanted to do with her just as friends like making Spotify playlists and Bible studies. 

After two months of not calling she randomly called to tell me about some drama she just had to tell someone and said there was no one else and I brought up ""This isn't what I expected after you not calling for two months."" And she said ""Yeahhhh, I know. That's a whole other phone call in itself. There's some things that happened and I've been wanting to call you but I've been so busy. I know I was a bitch. I am a bitch. And I could handle the situation better."" Something along those lines. She said she would call and explain sometime so I gave her time and space.

After about a month she randomly removed me from her close friends on Instagram which is where she posted everything. At this point I kinda crash out. She was my best friend and I'm being treated so unfairly and poorly. I've done so many things for this girl as a partner and nearly even more as a friend. I've told her things about myself that absolutely no one besides God Himself knows. We had an amazing friendship despite its flaws, and she even told me I don't have to worry about losing her as a friend when all this started but here we are. I send her some paragraphs because I'm breaking down at this point. My best friend is discarding me and this time there's even less of a reason than when she broke up with me. I confronted her saying she told me she'd talk to me about whatever is going on and her response was ""If I said one thing and then decide it no longer applies then I have the right to exercise that."" When I said I deserve an explanation as to why she's refusing to talk to me she said ""You deserve nothing from me."" She threw me to the dirt and treated me like trash. Like I never meant anything to her after everything. She blocked me on everything, and left the group chat.

For some added context and to answer future questions. Eventually we had a talk about why we broke up and I asked if our sexual immorality had anything to do with it (reminder we are Christians and anything sexual outside of marriage is sexual immorality. If you disagree, that's okay but I'm just giving context here) and she said ""yeah I'm sure that was a big part of it."" I asked that because obviously I still liked her and I still had no closure on why our relationship ended. Its not an easy thing to cope with at all. 

I mentioned her getting close to her coworker. Idk if anything is going on there, her Bible school is very strict on not dating anybody your first two years and even tell you to not be alone with the opposite sex if avoidable at all times. She's very uptight about following her school's authority, but feelings can get in the way of rules. I'm saying this because maybe that's the whole reason she discarded me, I dont know. Just throwing it out there. 

Finally I can get to my point. I lost my girlfriend, then I lost my best friend. Both times with no closure or answers or reasons. I think of her everyday. I miss our deep talks about the Bible and God, I miss laughing with her and talking about music, I miss the things we did when we were together and I constantly have flashbacks and dreams about that. But at the same time I'm also having imaginary conversations in my head about things I wanna say to her. Bitter things to put her in her place and tear her apart for how she would talk to me and treat me. I'm trying to forgive her without being able to talk to her, and I also miss her. I'm trying to move on, but haven't found anyone new to cover this wound, so in the meantime I'm trying to heal alone. And it's hard. I'm so tired of this everyday. Every day just feels the same.

Last thing I want to say is that if you have a problem with someone. Don't ignore it. Communicate. If you don't want them to be in your life anymore, tell them and TELL THEM WHY. I promise it hurts far worse when you distance and don't communicate. Just be honest and open even if it hurts. It saves more hurt. It gives closure. Discarding someone hurts worse than a breakup, because usually breakups have a reason, a cause, and conclusion. Discarding just hurts. It makes the other person feel worthless. Please, communicate to people.

Here’s a breakdown of my experience with three standouts: [Naked Hi Boy](https://go.shopmy.us/p-22459162), [Spritz](https://go.shopmy.us/p-22459205), and [Roadies](https://go.shopmy.us/p-22459244).

Naked Hi Boy

What it is: A totally unflavored THC sachet (5mg THC per packet) that you can add to literally anything—coffee, sparkling water, juice, smoothies, cocktails, even a vinaigrette if you’re feeling creative.

Experience: I love that it’s sugar-free, calorie-free, and hangover-free. Unlike a lot of flavored cannabis beverages, Naked Hi Boy puts the control in your hands—you get the buzz without changing the taste of your drink. I mixed mine into a cold brew and later into a citrus sparkling water, and it blended perfectly with zero aftertaste.

Why it’s great: Perfect for people who don’t want a pre-made flavor or who want to infuse their go-to drink. It’s also extremely portable—just toss a sachet in your bag and go.

Cann Spritz

What it is: A THC-infused apéritif concentrate with \~60mg THC per 750 mL bottle (about 17 servings at 3.5mg THC each). The flavor leans bright, bitter, and slightly herbal, like something between a classic Aperol spritz and a craft non-alcoholic bitter.

Experience: I followed their suggestion—1 part Spritz to 3 parts sparkling wine (or sparkling water for a non-alcoholic vibe). The taste is complex and refreshing, with a light orange zest and bitterness that feels grown-up and sophisticated. It’s perfect for a golden hour or dinner party vibe.

Why it’s great: This is Cann’s answer to the cocktail experience—it gives you the ritual of mixing a drink but without alcohol. The versatility is a big win. I could see this becoming my go-to for hosting because you can dial in the dose by how much you pour.

Cann Roadies

What it is: A portable, liquid THC and CBD shot (2mg THC + 4mg CBD per serving), available in Cann’s signature flavors like Blood Orange Cardamom, Lemon Lavender, Grapefruit Rosemary, Ginger Lemongrass, and Yuzu Elderflower.

Experience: These feel like “Cann in your pocket”—you can pour a Roadie into sparkling water or just drink it straight if you’re on the move. The flavor is fantastic—Blood Orange Cardamom is still my favorite, balancing citrus brightness with a subtle spice note. It kicks in fast (10-15 mins) with a mellow, social buzz.

Why it’s great: Ideal for festivals, beach days, or whenever you want something discreet and ready-to-go. The balanced THC/CBD ratio makes it very sessionable.

Overall Thoughts

Cann has nailed the “social alternative to alcohol” angle. Naked Hi Boy gives you versatility, Spritz gives you a more sophisticated cocktail-like ritual, and Roadies give you convenience. The effects are smooth, light, and social—think a glass of wine or beer but without the hangover. Plus, all products are vegan, gluten-free, and made with natural ingredients.

Would I recommend them?

Absolutely. If you want something customizable, start with Naked Hi Boy. If you love the vibe of aperitifs, Spritz is worth it (especially for entertaining). And if you want something grab-and-go, Roadies are perfect.",1,1754420068.0,u_Indyinabox,0,1.0,False

Turned into a respectful and informative conversation despite catching them in my horse pasture at 7 in the morning and them not wanting a cup of coffee when I offered, for some reason.

Didn't think much of it until a few days ago when someone else showed up at my place ""because of the White Tent City,"" and the interaction I had was more *fanatical* than respectful, so I've decided to read Visions of Glory and have a copy ordered.

Have any of you read the book? And do any of you accept/know people who've accepted the book as scripture? And if so, what's your opinion of it?

I'm not carrying any pre-judgement into the book. Just genuinely curious while concerned for the safety of my family and neighbors and want to get *prepped* as best as possible for what comes next. Would appreciate your insight.

Yes, we fight as all couples do, but at the end of the day he is my person and I love him so dearly.

I’m a house wife and do not have any children of my own, however my husband has 2 young children (elementary age) from a previous marriage. 

Recently I’ve been feeling extremely lonely as my husband is busy working and had guests over from over seas so he was spending a lot of time with them. I feel like my life recently has been cleaning the home, cooking for him and his guests, and waiting for him to get off work. And once he’s off work, I then wait for him to come home after he’s been with his guests. By the time he gets home, its already late and he’s exhausted from the day he’s had so it’s straight to sleep.

I’ve been actively trying to tell him that I feel lonely and I want to spend more time with him but I don’t want to sit on the couch the whole time. I want to go for a walk, visit a coffee shop, go to the grocery store, LITERALLY ANYTHING just so i can spend time with him anywhere besides the home.

I love his children as if they’re my own and since my husband works a lot I end up being the main caregiver for them whenever they come over. I see a lot of habits that arent healthy for the children such as not brushing their teeth or spending hours on the device. Their only chores in the home is to clean up after themselves but I feel like I’m alone in enforcing these rules. There are times when I tell them to do something such as get off the device and play outside but my husband tells them the opposite and lets them do what they want.

I just feel so exhausted… I’m constantly cleaning up after them, trying to raise his children, and on top of that, I’m sooo lonely.

Yesterday I had my 2nd crash out in a week. I was expecting to spend time with my husband but unexpectedly he invited his children to spend the night. This was going to be my first time in nearly a month that I was going to have him to myself but it broke me that he didn’t even consider what this meant to me. Instead he just assumed that it’d be okay because I love his kids.

We move on, its whatever. But then today, I’m in a slump. All the chores are done, I made a big batch of food so I wouldnt have to cook for today, so I gave myself the opportunity to mop in bed and rot. My heart feels so heavy that I’m just numb to everything. 

I took a nap and when I woke up, i saw that he got me flowers today and wrote me a card to tell me how much he appreciates me. And he also got me the right kind of chocolate 🤍 It made me so happy and I could feel the colour coming back to my life.

When I went to go thank him, right away he asked me to make him lunch. Its not a big deal, as he provides for me so I should give him good food to help him power through the day. But when he asked me to make him a whole different meal, my heart broke. I felt like the flowers and chocolate was just a way for me to shut up and get me out of my mood. 
He was perfectly fine with eating the food i made yesterday but when he asked me to cook again I just broke down and cried. 

I’m so mentally tired, I’m lonely, and I feel like a baby sitter that has no authority over anything. I havent been outside in so long… just to the nearby store to get small things but otherwise I’m lacking human interaction. 

AIO because I feel this way? Or should I remain patient?",3,1754419785.0,AmIOverreacting,8,1.0,False

  Aidan jolted out of his nightmare to find himself facedown on the kitchen table. Sweat trickled down his face. He raised a trembling hand to swipe it away. That was when he realized it was tears, not sweat, soaking his cheeks. He hadn’t had a nightmare about Amy’s accident in years. It only took a second for him to remember what had brought it on.  
  
  Emma.  
  
  Everything he thought he had felt for Amy was magnified a million times with Emma. He had only thought he knew what love was. Without even trying, she had managed to illicit feelings in him he never could have imagined. And now she was gone.  
  
  A defeated cry of agony slipped from his lips.  
  
  “I see we’re back to the nightmares, huh?”  
  
  Aidan jumped before jerking his gaze over his shoulder. “Hello to you too, Pop. How’d you get in?”  
  
  Patrick gave him a tight smile. “I have a key, son.”  
  
  When he whirled around in his chair, Aidan’s head spun, and he had to grip the table to steady himself. “Yeah, well, whatever happened to knocking?”  
  
  “I did, but you never came to the door. Now I can see why.”  
  
  Aidan stared up at the blurry double images of his father’s frowning face. One look of absolute and total disgust would have been enough, but damned if in his drunken state, there had to be two.  
  
  Patrick leaned back against the counter, crossing his arms over his chest. “Son, I do believe you’re shit-faced!”  
  
  After snorting contemptuously, Aidan’s face smacked hard onto the table. His chest rose and fell in laughter at the fact his father had actually said the word shit-faced. Of course his level of inebriation also made it funnier.  
  
  When he finally composed himself, he exclaimed, “Actually, Pop, I was shit-faced five beers and three shots of Patron ago. I think it’s safe to say I’m fucking plastered.”  
  
  “So is this where we are again?” Patrick huffed.  
  
  Raising his head, Aidan furrowed his brows. “What do you mean?”  
  
  Patrick’s face clouded over in anger. “You know exactly what I mean. You’re starting the same damn patterns as you did nine years ago, right down to the drinking like a lush.”  
  
  “I called you because I wanted your help, not a lecture. So if you came over here to yell at me then you can just fuck off!”  
  
  The next thing Aidan knew Patrick had yanked him up by his hair and was glaring down at him. “Don’t you ever speak that way to me again! I’m still your father, and you will show me respect. You got that?”  
  
  “Just leave me alone!” Aidan blared, trying to pull himself away.  
  
  Patrick tightened his grip on Aidan’s hair, causing him to wince in pain. “All right. That’s it. I’m going to treat you just like I would a prick of a recruit in The Corp who had screwed up!”  
  
  Before Aidan could protest, Patrick dragged him out of the kitchen chair. It clattered noisily to the floor. “Didn’t know you still had it in you, old man. You’re pretty agile for a seventy-two year old,” Aidan mused.  
  
  “You better shut up if you know what’s good for you!” Patrick snarled before shoving Aidan towards the hallway. He might’ve passed out again if Patrick hadn’t kept a firm hold on the scruff of his neck along with his belt buckle.  
  
  When they got into the master bedroom, Patrick pushed him in the bathroom. Aidan whirled around to catch Patrick locking the door. Dread washed over him. Nervously he staggered back as Patrick stalked over to him. “Shit, Pop, you aren’t gonna beat my ass again like the time in high school when you discovered that pot stash under my bed, are you?”  
  
  Ignoring him, Patrick went to the shower. After flipping on the water, he grabbed Aidan’s arm and jerked him into the stall. Ice cold water rained down on h  
im. Even through his clothes, each droplet felt like a jagged knife piercing his skin. He tried to get out, but Patrick slammed the shower door shut. “You’re going to stay in there until you can sober up and discuss what happened like a man!”  
  
  Aidan thrashed against the door, but Patrick held firm. “I’m too old for this bullshit, son. I may not be around in nine years when you try to pull another stunt like this again. At least let me die in peace knowing that you’ve got a wife and child to love!”  
  
  Patrick’s words froze Aidan more than the cold water pelting him. Just the thought of how he had hurt Emma sent pangs of regret reverberating through him. Instead of protesting any further, he turned and stood under the shower nozzle, letting the icy water sting him like the lashes of the whip. Hanging his head, he wished it was a whip. He deserved to be beaten for everything he had said and done in the last few weeks to Emma and in turn his son. Physical punishment would be a welcome relief to release the emotional torment within him.  
  
  “You manning up now?” Patrick asked.  
  
  “Yes sir,” Aidan murmured under the stream of water.  
  
  “Good. I’ll go put on a pot of coffee. I’ll be waiting for you when you’re ready to talk.”  
  
  Biting his lip, Aidan couldn’t stop the tears filling his eyes from spilling over his cheeks. He wanted more than anything for his father to somehow find a way to help him get Emma back. “Thanks, Pop,” he said, his voice wavering with emotion.  
  
  “You’re welcome.”  
  
  Aidan forced himself to stay under the water until his cloudy senses became clearer. When he could walk without staggering, he got out of the shower. His teeth chattered as he tore off his soaked clothes. After toweling off at record speed, he padded into the bedroom and threw on a pair of pajama pants and a t-shirt.  
  
  When he got to the kitchen, Patrick sat at the table. A smile tugged at the corners of his lips. “Sorry I had to go all Marines on you.”  
  
  Aidan shook his head. “I deserved it. Frankly, you should’ve kicked my ass.”  
  
  “Becoming a masochist, are we?”  
  
  Shrugging, Aidan poured himself a cup of coffee. “I deserve nothing less. I hurt the ones I care about the most.”  
  
  Patrick sighed. “I don’t know about that. There’s a lot of goodness in you, Aidan. I wish you could see that.”  
  
  “Must not be much goodness in me if I keep fucking up.”  
  
  “Speaking of that…” Patrick eased back in his chair, resting his arm along the top rung. “Before I offer to help, I have to know one thing.”  
  
  Aidan arched his brows and took a tentative sip of coffee. The scorching liquid seared his tongue. “What is it?” he croaked.  
  
  “Do you honestly want Emma back because you love her, or is it because you feel guilty?”  
  
  “This isn’t like what happened with Amy,” Aidan protested.  
  
  “It’s just a simple question, son. Do you want to spend the rest of your life with Emma and your son or not? I mean, most men who are truly in love don’t go and try to sleep with other women.”  
  
  Hot, bitter tears stung Aidan’s eyes. “I do love her, Pop. That’s the God’s honest truth.” He ground the tears out of his eyes with his fists. Sinking down in a chair across from Patrick, he related all the details of the day on the dock. “Even though I couldn’t say it to her then or even tonight when she wanted me to, I do love Emma.”  
  
  “So the year you tried to get Amy back that was all about—”  
  
  Aidan closed his eyes in pain. “Guilt, not love. She managed to kill the love I had for her by deceiving me. But because of the baby, I was going to stand by her.”  
  
  “Does Emma know any of this?”  
  
  Snapping open his eyelids, Aidan replied, “I only told her about the cheating. I didn’t think she could handle the rest.”  
  
  “I think you need to tell her.”  
  
  Aidan grimaced. “I will. If she ever speaks to me again.”  
  
  “I have a feeling she’ll come around.”  
  
  “Don’t tell me it’s because of your damn Irish intuition,” Aidan said, quirking his eyebrows.  
  
  “No, it’s because Becky got a hold of her leaving here tonight.”  
  
  Groaning, Aidan rubbed his hands over his face. “Great. I’m sure they’ll be leading a charge over here at any moment to roast my manhood over an open flame!”  
  
  Patrick chuckled. “Don’t sell your sister short. She and the rest of the girls may want to castrate you for your actions, but they do love you and want to see you happy.” He leaned forward and patted Aidan’s hand. “And they know how you’ve screwed up in the past and sabotaged your own happiness.”  
  
  Aidan’s nostrils flared in anger. “They don’t know the whole story, Pop. They don’t know what Amy did!”  
  
  “I know that. It’s a secret that stayed firmly between you, Amy, and myself.”  
  
  Clenching his fists, Aidan said, “Don’t you know how many times I wanted to scream at Mom when she was singing Amy’s praises, throwing it in my face about how she was married and happy? If she had only known it was Amy who fucked me up in the head for any other woman.”  
  
  “That was your choice not to tell her, son. I didn’t like keeping it from her. Your mother and I had so few secrets, but I kept yours.”  
  
  Aidan softened his furious expression. “I appreciated it, Pop.”  
  
  Patrick smiled. “You’re welcome.” He got up and poured out the remainder of his coffee in the sink. “So, you’re going to talk to Emma and tell her the truth about Amy?”  
  
  “Yeah. Just as soon as she’ll speak to me.”  
  
  “Good. I’m glad to hear it.” Patrick glanced at his watch. “Well, I guess I better be hitting the road.”  
  
  Aidan’s chest clenched at the prospect of being alone. “It’s awfully late for you to be out driving. Maybe you should stay here for the night.”  
  
  He met his father’s gaze. With his eyes, Aidan tried saying what he was too embarrassed to admit: He didn’t want to be alone.  
  
  Patrick gave a brief nod of his head. “I guess you’re right. You don’t mind putting your old man up for the night?”  
  
  Aidan gave a half smile. “I’d be happy to.”  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  Three Weeks Later  
  
  “N, Thirteen,” the Bingo announcer’s voice droned.  
  
  “What did he say, dear?” Mrs. Petersen asked Emma, glancing down at her card.  
  
  Knowing that Mrs. Peterson was practically stone deaf, even with her hearing aids, Emma drew in a deep breath and shouted, “N, THIRTEEN!”  
  
  Mrs. Petersen smiled and bobbed her gray head.  
  
  When Patrick chuckled beside her, Emma arched her eyebrows. “What?”  
  
  “Come on, Emma, you’re a beautiful, vibrant young woman. What in the hell are you doing here at the VFW with me and a bunch of other old farts?”  
  
  She giggled. “Are you kidding? How could I miss Saturday Bingo? What about all the fabulous prizes I could win? That bulk sized box of Depends is calling my name.” When his chest vibrated with amusement, she wagged a finger at him. “Hey, you shouldn’t laugh. You’ve had a pregnant wife and daughters. You know lack of bladder control is serious business.”  
  
  His eyes widened. “Such a little sass pot, aren’t you? What a mouth you’ve got for such a supposedly sweet girl.”  
  
  Emma’s heart stilled as she heard Aidan’s deep voice echo in her ears, “That mouth of yours is trouble.” A raging ache burned through her chest, and she fought to catch her breath. Trying to push the painful memories away, she shook her head. “Well, you know the real reason I’m here is because you’ve been having dizzy spells and shouldn’t drive.”  
  
  He scowled. “Becky took both sets of my car keys before she and Liz blew town!”  
  
  “It’s Fall Break for their kids, and they’re only going to be in Disney World for four days. It’s not their fault they were worried enough about you to take your keys. It’s your own fault for allowing that damn Fitzgerald stubbornness to keep you from going to the doctor.”  
  
  “I have an appointment next  
week.” When Emma raised her eyebrows skeptically, Patrick swiped his finger over his heart and swore, “Scout’s Honor.”  
  
  “If you say so. I should insist on taking you myself to ensure you get there.”  
  
  Patrick groaned. “Great. Now I have another worrywart daughter on my ass all the time.”  
  
  Emma’s heart warmed at the notion of being considered as his daughter. Regardless of how she felt about Aidan, she could never, ever distance herself from Patrick and his love.  
  
  After a woman with a blue bouffant clapped her hands manically and shouted, “Bingo!” Patrick leaned forward in his chair, a serious expression washing over his face. “So are we not going to talk about the white elephant in the room?”  
  
  Emma cut her eyes over to him and grinned. “You mean the fact that one of the prizes is an enema bag?”  
  
  Crossing his arms over his chest, Patrick huffed, “That is not what I’m talking about, and you know it.”  
  
  She ducked her head, staring down at her Bingo card like it was the most fascinating thing she had ever seen. “I’d rather not,” she whispered.  
  
  “Look, Em, I’m sure you’re already experiencing the intense love a parent can have for their child. Aidan is my son, and I love him with all my heart.” When she jerked her head up to glare at him, he held up both his hands in surrender. “But that doesn’t mean I condone what he did to you. Trust me, I wanted to inflict bodily harm on him.” An amused glint twinkled in his dark eyes. “Well, I sort of did.”  
  
  Emma gasped. “What did you do?”  
  
  He chuckled. “Trust me, it was nothing that he didn’t deserve, or that my seventy-two year old ass could actually dish out!”  
  
  “You’re terrible!” Emma replied, but she couldn’t help giggling.  
  
  Patrick took his hand in hers. “I just want you to know I’m Switzerland in all this, okay? I love you and my grandchild, just like I do Aidan.”  
  
  “Thank you. I appreciate that.” She squeezed his hand. “And I hope you know I would never ask you to take sides or try to keep you away from the baby because of what happened with Aidan. I know that, sweetheart. From the first day I met you, I knew what kind of girl you are, and there isn’t a malicious bone in your body.” He paused and shook his head. “But if I don’t say what’s in my heart, I’m going to explode.”  
  
  Gnawing one of her already frayed fingernails, Emma held her breath, bracing herself for what Patrick had to say.  
  
  “I’m extremely worried about Aidan. It’s been three weeks, and he’s miserable, Emma. He doesn’t sleep, and he barely eats.”  
  
  The spiteful, vindictive side of her relished in the thoughts of Aidan’s suffering. She gave Patrick a skeptical look. “I seriously doubt that. He’s probably just vying for your sympathy and trying to turn you against me.”  
  
  “No, I’ve seen it with my own eyes. He’s been staying with me because he can’t stand being alone.”  
  
  Emma widened her eyes as her heart clenched in agony for Aidan. Although a very large part of her delighted in the thought of him hurting as badly as she was, another part of her pitied him. As much as she wanted to despise him, she couldn’t. Every moment of the past three weeks, she had tried to bury her feelings and embrace the fact Aidan would never be completely emotionally available. To let him back into her life would be to walk barefoot over the shards of her broken heart. He would cut her again—it was inevitable.  
  
  But from the depth of her soul, she still loved him. There was a part of her that feared she always would—just like a part of her still loved Travis. She hated herself for feeling that way.  
  
  “Can you honestly say that nothing he has done in the past few weeks has softened your heart to him?” Patrick asked.  
  
  A tortured sigh escaped her lips. When Becky had said Aidan would try to win her back, she hadn’t been kidding. Not even being forewarned could have prepared for the initial barrage of telephone calls, texts, and emails. He had even tried coming to her office, but she had asked the security guard to remove him. It had been quite a scene with Aidan scuffling with the guard to try to get to her. He had then been warned by her manager never to come on her floor again.  
  
  Then he switched tactics. Her house soon doubled for a florist’s with all the flowers he bought. Every bouquet and every dozen roses he sent had a separate card filled with his ramblings of remorse, how much he missed her, and how much he cared for her and the baby. Since there was still no profession of love, she gave him the silent treatment.  
  
  “Em?” Patrick questioned, jarring her out of her thoughts.  
  
  She twisted the hemline of her blouse in her fingers. “Don’t you know how hard it’s been with my feelings, coupled with my pregnancy hormones, to ignore him?”  
  
  “I would be lying if I said I wasn’t impressed with his tenacity. Not even with Amy did he do something as heartfelt as that poetry book.”  
  
  Emma pinched her eyes shut. That damn book! It had almost shattered her resolve. When she had opened the wrapped package and found an antique edition of love poetry by the Romantics, she had wept uncontrollably for an hour. The sight of John Keats, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron brought thoughts not only of his nephews, but the glaring fact he remembered she loved their poetry. And while it was a book filled with sentiments of love, he still hadn’t said the words himself. For Emma, that meant everything.  
  
  “I’m truly sorry he’s going through so much. But I’m hurting, too,” she finally said.  
  
  “I know you are, honey. But if I asked you just to talk to him for a few minutes, would you humor an old man?”  
  
  “Oh Patrick, don’t you see. I’m scared.”  
  
  “That he’ll…cheat again?”  
  
  She bobbed her head. “With Travis, I never had to worry about him being unfaithful. He was totally devoted from the time we first started dating. I haven’t dated a lot or been out in the world, so I don’t know how to be with someone like Aidan and keep my sanity.”  
  
  Patrick rubbed his chin. Emma could tell there was something he wasn’t saying—something that held a piece of Aidan’s puzzle. “I don’t like to beg, but would you just consider sitting down with him and trying to hear him out? I know it would mean the world to him, and I think it would mean a lot to you, too.”  
  
  A whoosh of air deflated her chest. “I guess I could try.”  
  
  “That’s my girl,” he said, his face lighting up. “Good. Now that I’ve got that out of the way, I could use some dessert. Want something?”  
  
  As if on cue, Emma’s stomach rumbled, and she grinned. “Even though I shouldn’t, would you bring me back some more of that homemade pound cake?”  
  
  Patrick smiled. “Good choice. I was going after a piece myself.”  
  
  She grabbed his sleeve. “Just make sure it isn’t Mrs. Forrester’s. I think she accidentally put salt instead of sugar this time.”  
  
  He chuckled. “Oh lord. I do believe she has a screw or two loose.”  
  
  “You shouldn’t say that. You know she’s sweet on you,” Emma teased.  
  
  “And don’t think I’m not going to keep running away from her. She’d probably kill me with food poisoning or something.”  
  
  Emma laughed. “You don’t have to run too fast. She’s just one of your many admirers.”  
  
  “Whatever,” he grumbled. As he rose out of his chair, Patrick winced and rubbed his chest.  
  
  “Are you all right?” Emma asked.  
  
  “I’m fine,” he murmured. But when he took another step forward around the table, he gasped and then collapsed onto the ground.  
  
  “Patrick!” Emma cried, leaping out of her chair. She raced over to him and knelt down, grabbing his hand in hers.  
  
  “My heart,” he moaned.  
  
  “Someone call 911!” she screamed, trying to fight the rising panic that drummed in her chest.  
  
  “I will!” the bingo announcer replied, bringing his phone to his ear.  
  
  “Here give him this,” a lady said, thrusting an aspirin in front of Emma’s face. She took it from the lady and brought it to Patrick’s lips.  
  
  “Swallow this.”  
  
  He lifted his head and let her put the pill in his mouth.  
  
  “You don’t have any other medicine with you to take? Like nitroglycerin?”  
  
  Patrick grimaced. “Left it in my other pants,” he wheezed. At what must’ve been her horrified expression, he murmured, “Sorry.”  
  
  “No, don’t apologize. It’s okay.”  
  
  “Pray, angel.” A shaky hand came up to tenderly touch her cheek.  
  
  Tears stung her eyes. “Of course, I will. I am. And you do too! Say a Hail Mary or whatever it is you Catholics do!”  
  
  Patrick chuckled and then winced. “Don’t make me laugh.”  
  
  “I’m sorry.” She squeezed his hand tight and tried to give him a reassuring smile.  
  
  “If this doesn’t go well—”  
  
  Emma’s body tensed. “No! Don’t you dare talk like that!”  
  
  He closed his eyes briefly before opening them. “Listen to me. If I don’t make it, promise me you’ll give Aidan another chance.”  
  
  “Oh Patrick,” she moaned.  
  
  “Promise,” he urged.  
  
  The last thing in the world she wanted to do was lie to a potentially dying man. Somehow she found the courage to nod her head. “Okay, I promise.”  
  
  “Good girl.”  
  
  When firemen came barreling through the door, Emma said a thanks to God that the fire station sat just across the street from the VFW. Since most of them had EMT training, she knew they could help Patrick until the ambulance arrived.  
  
  “Excuse us, ma’am,” a young guy said.  
  
  Emma reluctantly dropped Patrick’s hand. The two firemen inched past her and squatted beside Patrick. Entwining her fingers, she brought them to her lips that were murmuring prayers. She watched as one man put an oxygen mask over Patrick’s face while the other took his pulse.  
  
  Lost in her own thoughts, she didn’t even hear the ambulance siren. The next thing she knew EMT’s had arrived and were putting Patrick on a stretcher. “Em!” came his panicked cry through his mask.  
  
  “I’m right here,” she called, pushi  
ng one of the firemen out of the way. Groping along the gurney, she snatched up his hand. “I’m here. You’re going to be just fine.”  
  
  The stretcher rumbled and shook along the uneven pavement as they wheeled him to the open doors of the ambulance. Emma had to fight to keep up with them, and she found herself winded as they started to load Patrick inside. His face crumpled when she was forced to let his hand go.  
  
  “I’m still here!” she cried, fighting the tears that scorched and burned her throat and eyes.  
  
  Emma felt a hand on her shoulder. A young fireman with kind eyes smiled at her. “Do you want to ride with him?”  
  
  “Please, can I?”  
  
  “Sure you can. Just come around to the front with me.”  
  
  Emma stepped closer to the doors of the ambulance. “Patrick, I’m going to be right up front. I’m not leaving you. Okay?”  
  
  He bobbed his head. “I love you, and I’m right up front,” she cried again, as the fireman pulled her away.  
  
  They walked around the side of the ambulance. He opened the passenger side door for her. “Up you go.”  
  
  She braced herself on the doorframe and tried hoisting herself up. With her adrenaline depleted, she was too weak. Hands came around her waist and pushed her forward. She gasped as she flopped onto the seat. Once she collected herself, she turned around.  
  
  The young fireman’s cheeks flushed crimson. “Sorry about that.”  
  
  “No, it’s okay. Thanks for the help.”  
  
  He grinned before slamming the door. Emma turned in her seat to watch the EMT’s working on Patrick. “See, I didn’t leave you,” she said.  
  
  The wail of the ambulance’s siren starting up caused Emma to shudder. Like an electrical storm in the summer, long buried memories flashed in her mind. Although she gripped the sides of her seat, she was miles away from the chaos surrounding her.  
  
  With her hand wrapped firmly in her mother’s, she skipped into the fire station. At the sight of her father, she squealed and ran forward. “Daddy! Daddy!”  
  
  “Hey baby,” he said, hoisting her into his arms. She wrapped her legs around him as he squeezed her tight. “So you’re finally getting to see my new station, huh?”  
  
  Emma nodded. She hadn’t quite understood why they had left the mountains to come to the city. In fact, she had cried big tears from the back window of the car when she watched Granddaddy and Grammy waving goodbye. But Daddy had tried to explain he could make more money if he worked as a fireman in Atlanta, rather than in Ellijay. They could have nicer things. He’d even gotten her a puppy to try to make things easier.  
  
  “Let me wear your hat! Please Daddy!”  
  
  He chuckled. “Of course you can.” When he sat the fireman’s visor on her head, Emma’s neck felt wobbly and weighted down. He walked her over to the gleaming red fire engine. “You want to hear the siren, angel?”  
  
  She squirmed in his arms. “Oh yes!”  
  
  He climbed onto the rig and sat her down on the seat. Her hands automatically went to the steering wheel, and she turned it back and forth, pretending to drive. He blared the horn. “Again, Daddy!” He grinned and honked it until the rest of the guys in the firehouse were ready to throttle him.  
  
  Like wispy shadows of fog swirling along rooftops and skylines, Emma’s mind unveiled another memory just a short year later. She was at school and sitting on the reading rug. With rapt attention, she listened to her teacher reading from a book about bears having a Halloween party where popcorn overflowed their house. The classroom door creaked opened, and Emma stared in surprise at Granddaddy standing in the doorway. She raced over to meet him, happily taking his hand. Out in the hallway, he pulled her into his arms and carried her outside. Grammy stood at the car hugging Nana, Daddy’s mother. Emma peppered him with questions. “What’s happened, Granddaddy? Why are you all here in Atlanta? Where’s Mommy and Daddy?”  
  
  For the first time she could ever remember, Granddaddy had tears in his dark eyes. “Emmie Lou, there was a bad fire, and your Daddy was trying to save these children. He got them out safely, but he…” His voice choked off with emotion. “Baby, your Daddy’s gone to live with the angels.”  
  
  That one statement sent her kicking and screaming out of his embrace. “No, no, no! Daddy wouldn’t leave me! He’s taking me to the circus this weekend.” Her fists beat into Granddaddy’s belly. “You tell the angels to bring Daddy back!” she cried.  
  
  The sound of the ambulance doors rattling open snapped Emma into another memory. Once again she clutched her mother’s hand as they weaved in between the tombstones in the cemetery. She had never seen so many people in all her life. People kept calling her daddy a hero. They sank down onto one of the velvet chairs under a green tent. Clinging to her mother’s side, she jumped with every rifle blast of the Twenty-One gun salute. Then a man knelt before her mother with a folded flag. He glanced over to Emma and gave her a sad smile. She would never forget his soulful brown eyes.  
  
  “Ma’am?”  
  
  Emma jolted back into the present. Glancing over her shoulder, she saw that Patrick’s stretcher had already been taken from the ambulance. The EMT, who had driven them to the hospital, stood with the passenger side door opened, beckoning her with his hand. “Here let me help you.”  
  
  “Thank you,” she murmured. After she hopped down, he led her through the automatic doors. Pointing down the hallway, he said, “They took him to room two.”  
  
  She nodded. “Thank you for everything.”  
  
  Emma staggered down the white tiled floor. An antiseptic smell assaulted her senses. Men and women in blue and green scrubs hustled between rooms and patients. She gave the nurses station a fleeting glance before cutting across the hall to where Patrick was. When Emma started for the door, a nurse blocked her. “No, ma’am. You can’t go in there. You’ll have to go to the waiting room.”  
  
  “How is he?”  
  
  “We don’t know anything yet. They’re running tests.” The nurse gripped Emma’s shoulder. “If you’ll just go have a seat, someone will—”  
  
  Emma shook her head furiously from side to side. “Please, let me stay here. I won’t get in the way, I promise. He didn’t want me to leave him!”  
  
  The nurse took in Emma’s swollen stomach, and her expression softened. She glanced over her shoulder before sighing. “Okay. Is there anyone else you should call?”  
  
  Emma had been so consumed by the ghosts of the past along with Patrick’s condition, she hadn’t even thought of calling Aidan or his sisters. Her hand flew to her mouth. “Oh God, I can’t believe I didn’t call his children!”  
  
  “It’s okay, honey. I’m sure you’ve had a lot to process. Why don’t you step right over there?” the nurse motioned to a table with a shiny black phone on top of it.  
  
  Emma nodded and walked away from Patrick’s door. She eased down into the uncomfortable plastic chair. With Becky and Liz in Disney World and Julia living out of state, Aidan and Angie were the closest in distance of getting to the hospital. She tried Angie first, hoping she could get her to call Aidan. But she didn’t pick up, so Emma was forced to leave her a voicemail asking her to call her as soon as she could.  
  
  With shaky fingers, she dialed Aidan’s cell number. He answered on the third ring. “This is Aidan Fitzgerald.”  
  
  The sound of the deep timbre of his voice vibrating her ear made her chest tighten. For a few moments, she couldn’t process thoughts, and she certainly couldn’t speak. “Hello?” he prompted.  
  
  “Um, it’s me.”  
  
  Aidan sucked in a sharp breath on the other line. “Emma…” The way he said her name caused her to shiver. It hummed with a mixture of both pleasure and pain. “God, it’s so good to hear your voice.” She remained motionless, unspeaking and unblinking. He was paralyzing her with just his voice. “Please say something. Please talk to me, Em,” he begged.

# Best Coffee Body Wash 2025: Energize Your Skin!

Coffee body wash is rapidly gaining popularity, promising not just cleanliness but also an invigorating start to the day. Packed wiht the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and frequently enough containing caffeine, these washes aim to awaken the senses while gently exfoliating and nourishing the skin. For those seeking a morning boost or simply a luxurious shower experience, coffee body washes offer a compelling alternative to traditional soaps and gels.

## Key Features Analysis

The best coffee body washes in 2025 stand out due to a combination of high-quality ingredients, enticing fragrances, and effective formulations.

**Caffeine Content:** The presence and concentration of caffeine is a crucial factor. The best washes contain a sufficient amount of caffeine to potentially stimulate blood flow and tighten the skin temporarily.

The size and texture of these granules are carefully chosen to avoid irritation, even on sensitive skin.**Moisturizing Agents:** To counteract the potential drying effects of coffee and exfoliants, premium coffee body washes include hydrating ingredients. Common moisturizers include shea butter, coconut oil, aloe vera, and hyaluronic acid. These ingredients work to replenish the skin's natural oils, leaving it feeling soft and supple after each wash.

Sienna’s POV

""Sloppy form on that dismount, Reyes!"" Coach Foster's voice cut across the gym like a whip crack.

He stormed toward me, clipboard clutched in his white-knuckled grip.

""And those landings—are you gaining weight again? It's getting obvious!""

Around us, the other gymnasts froze mid-routine, their eyes darting between George and me like spectators at a gladiator match.

Sarah stopped her floor routine entirely. Maya's hands slipped on the beam.

""I hit my marks,"" I said, my voice steady despite the fire burning in my chest.

""Don't you dare argue with me!"" George stepped closer, invading my space until I could smell his stale coffee breath. ""Your body fat percentage is up. Your form is deteriorating. And if you think attitude is going to get you to the Olympics—""

""My weight is exactly what it was last month.""

The gym went dead silent. Even the sound system seemed to pause between songs. George's face flushed red, his jaw working like he was chewing nails.

""Extra conditioning. Tonight. And tomorrow morning at five AM."" He scribbled furiously on his clipboard. ""Maybe hunger will teach you respect.""

I stayed still, heart pounding from more than just exertion.

In gymnastics, perfection isn't a goal, it's a demand, and the price is your body, your mind, and everything in between.

I learned early enough that pain gets praised and silence keeps you safe. But even silence can't shield you when everything starts to shift.

The gym doors creaked open, and Maria Holloway, the center director, stepped inside.

Clipboard in hand. Tight jaw. I could tell something was off before she said a word.

“George. Sienna.” Her heels clicked across the floor. “We have an update. Ford Callen is joining our coaching staff.”

The name hit harder than George’s insults. I glanced at him, and the reaction came fast, pure disdain.

“Callen?” His voice climbed. “That washed-up has-been? Couldn’t handle being second best, so now you're bringing that reform zealot into my program?”

""Our program,"" Maria corrected sharply. ""And he starts today.""

""Over my dead body!"" George's face went purple. ""That man is poison! He destroys everything he touches with his soft-approach nonsense. My girls are champions because I make them champions!""

""Your girls are breaking down,"" Maria shot back, her composure cracking. ""Injury rates are through the roof. Three girls quit last month alone.""

""Weak links!"" George slammed his hand against the nearest apparatus. ""I don't coddle quitters!""

I stayed quiet, processing. I’d heard of Callen, of course. Everyone had. Olympic prodigy turned coach with a reputation for... well, *a lot*.

He was either ahead of his time or a walking controversy, depending on who you asked. George hated him, clearly. That alone made me curious.

""I..."" I started, but the gym doors opened again.

Ford Callen walked in like he owned the place.

Tall, broad-shouldered, dressed entirely in black athletic wear that made him look like death incarnate. His dark hair was tousled, a thin scar cutting through his right eyebrow like a battle wound.

But it was his eyes that commanded attention—sharp, observing, missing nothing as they swept the room.

He didn't announce himself. Didn't smile or offer pleasantries. He simply stood there, taking inventory of the chaos he'd walked into.

""Callen."" George's voice dripped with venom.

""Foster."" Ford's response was flat, emotionless.

The tension between them was electric, crackling across the space like live wires. Every gymnast in the room felt it.

We'd all heard the stories—former training partners, rival coaches, bad blood that went back years.

Something about the way he looked at me, not lascivious, not cruel, but clinical, and it made my pulse jump. And then I hated myself for noticing how attractive he was.

He looked like trouble.

The kind that didn’t yell but dismantled you with silence. I broke eye contact, jaw tight, and resumed stretching like it hadn’t happened.

""Sienna Reyes,"" he said, my name carrying weight in his deep voice.

""That's my athlete,"" George snarled, stepping protectively—or possessively—in front of me.

“Sienna, I know this is sudden,” Maria started. “Ford Callen has a different approach, but he’s been brought in for a reason. He’s highly respected.”

“I already have a coach,” I said, keeping my voice even. “Coach Foster’s methods work.”

Her eyes softened. “I’m not asking you to switch loyalties. Just… be open. We all want you at the Olympics. Callen’s here to help.”

I nodded once. No promises made.

That evening, I stayed late for my second round of conditioning. It wasn’t mandatory, but I’d built a routine that didn’t allow rest. The gym was quieter than usual, lit by half the overheads.

My arms ached, legs heavy, but I worked through it. Floor passes, rope climbs, core sets until the burn dulled into background noise. My phone buzzed mid-cooldown.

*\&gt; Coach Foster***:** *Callen watched your floor today. Claims your landings are unstable. Wants access to your training logs. I told him exactly where he could shove his opinions. Don't speak to him. Don't listen to him. Extra conditioning tomorrow, 5 AM sharp. We'll show him what real commitment looks like.*

I stared at the message, thumb hovering over the screen. My body screamed for rest, but I typed the only reply George expected.

*\&gt; Me:* *I’ll be ready.*

But as I packed up my gear, movement caught my eye. A figure in black sat motionless in the bleachers, arms crossed, watching. Ford Callen. Waiting.

This time, I didn't look away. Didn't pretend he wasn't there. We stared at each other across the empty gym, two predators sizing each other up.

""Rough day?"" he called out, his voice echoing in the silence.

""I've had worse.""

He stood slowly, deliberately, and walked down from the bleachers. Each step seemed calculated, purposeful. When he reached the floor, he stopped just close enough to make his presence felt.

""George thinks he owns you,"" he said simply.

""Nobody owns me.""

""Good."" His eyes held mine steadily. ""Because tomorrow, we're going to find out what you're really capable of.""",1,1754419222.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1mihfuy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mihfuy,Birthday week review🥳6/4/2025,"Disclaimer- I am an employee and put extra stuff on the cookies I take home, but reviews are based on how we sell them.

My birthday is Wednesday, by the way 😉

Freakier Friday key lime blackberry cake 🦠 1/10 - freaky is right, this cake looks like a scabby bruise and tastes like expired fruit leather. Or maybe it looks more like guacamole, but the avocados were bad. Sour and tangy, but not in a good way. I immediately spit out the bite I took. The cheesecake filling inside is minimal, as you can see, we barely cut out any of the cake to fill it, and the lime cheesecake flavor in general is completely washed away by the weird combination of blackberry glaze and lime frosting. Actually, the filling tastes nothing like lime, just… air? It really has no flavor. Then there’s the cake itself.. it’s like a contradiction of itself. Dry on the inside, yet goopy on the outside since it’s soaked with milk and glaze. Dense at the bottom, but it’s like every other crumbl cake where it flakes and falls apart into a million cake crumbs. The structure is awful! And it’s made with egg whites, which smelled awful during the mixing process. I may not be a lime dessert person in the first place, but this combination of flavors does NOT jive together, and the visuals aren’t helping to make this appetizing. 

Vanilla strawberry cake 🍰 4/10 - the vanilla bean frosting is to die for, and when combined with fresh strawberry slices, it really embodies the feeling of summer. Like eating strawberries and whipped cream. That’s just the frosting and fresh strawberries though… the cake and strawberry jam can be tossed in the trash. If you’ve read my reviews, you know I don’t like the cakes in general, they are cheap, tasteless, and not worth my time and effort. I also *really* dislike the housemade strawberry jam. It has the texture of jell-o that was microwaved and is way too mouthpuckeringly tart. It completely ruins the fresh strawberry taste by using frozen strawberries. I would rather have a cup of frosting mixed with fresh strawberry slices. 

Cinnamon scone 🥐 8/10 - I absolutely adore the flavors of this cookie. It’s rich and buttery, but not too heavy on the butter and cinnamon glaze. The cinnamon buttercream is also a perfect balance of spice and sweet, and is a lot fluffier in texture compared to other buttercreams we use. I can imagine eating a piece of this with a cup of coffee or tea to end the day.

Biscoff lava 🌋 6.5/10 (7.5/10 if you cover it in Biscoff like I did) - stuffed cookies are hit or miss, usually a miss because there’s barely enough stuffing inside to even taste it. The cookies need to weigh more to allow for more stuffing… but we all know crumbl won’t let us do that so we have to put a tiny dollop of cookie butter inside that won’t make a difference. If that’s what they think ‘lava’ is then this volcano must be dormant.. or extinct. The cookie itself is very plain and the cookie butter drizzle on top doesn’t give enough biscoff flavor. It just needs more! It needs the Fluff’s treatment! 

Mallow sammich 🖤 9.5/10 - ahhh a classic favorite! As you can see, I make mine ‘open-faced’ because I don’t like the sandwich style cookies, so as it’s sold, it gets a 9.5/10. If it were open faced, easily a 10/10. But I review things how they are sold, so as a sandwich cookie, I find the cookie layers to be too thin and they end up having too crispy of a texture, and fall apart easily. If they were thicker, it would be soft and fluffy in the center, and would be able to hold up against the soft filling: The filling is refreshing and is definitely reminiscent of the center of an Oreo. There’s so much texture in this cookie, from the outside layers, to the fluffy filling, the crunchy Oreo pieces and the rich gooey brownie pieces. Definitely a must try for any chocolate or Oreo lover.

Chocolate covered banana 🍌 9.2/10 - this one scared me before I took a bite, because banana is a hit or miss flavor for me. It’s either too artificial, or the bananas weren’t ripe enough, or it has the texture of baby food. This cookie, however, is none of those things! Have you ever had a frozen chocolate covered banana? That’s what this tastes like, but I don’t have to worry about freezing my sensitive teeth! The cookie base is soft, even when chilled, and it’s similar to banana bread, with less spices. The banana mousse on top doesn’t taste like laffy taffy, and instead tasted like a refreshing vanilla mousse with a hint of banana. Semi sweet chocolate and roasted peanuts on top are really the star that wraps it all together! It’s sweet and salty, and is the hit of richness this cookie needed. It’s also crunchy in contrast to the very soft cookie and mousse. Great combination of flavors and textures!! ",14,1754419096.0,CrumblCookies,6,0.85,False

Hey everyone,

Putting myself out there a bit. I'm a 37-year-old guy living in London. Life's pretty good, but it's always nice to meet new people, right?

A few things I enjoy:

* **Swimming:** You'll often find me doing laps at the local pool – it's my go-to for clearing my head and staying active. Always happy to chat about good spots or even find a swimming buddy.
* **Photography:** I love capturing moments and a bit of the world around me. You can get a feel for my style over on my Flickr:[https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/)
* **Reading:** I'm a big fan of history, and I'm currently making my way through ""Revolutionary Spring"" by Christopher Clark. It's a fascinating look at 1848 in Europe. Always up for book recommendations or a good discussion.

Beyond that, I enjoy exploring London's never-ending offerings, decent coffee, and good conversation.

Looking to connect with friendly, interesting people for chats, maybe a coffee or a walk, and see where things go. Whether you share some of these interests or have completely different ones you're passionate about, I'm open to hearing from you.

So I met a guy online. We met for coffee and talked for a few hours. Seemed great. 
Texted a few times and he said he was coming to the city today. 
I told him I’m not an early bird as he is
He texted me saying he was looking for a place to roll a joint once he’s already here. No text telling me he was on his way. No confirmation had even occurred 

I replied and he texts put on the coffee and we’ll have a smoke 
I told him I was not having someone In my apartment that h I only met once. 
He said fine. I said give me 45 minutes 
When I was ready he said he was now in another place and would text when he got back to my neighborhood 
I replied that I would walk that way. I also texted him a random question. He didn’t reply so I called. He didn’t answer 
So after a while I texted I’m going out 
Omg. I can’t with all the details 
Long and short. I suspect he was miffed I didn’t let him in. He ignored my texts and call
Until I texted I was going somewhere else 
Then I just said no I’m not into texting only mentioning him not answering the phone 
At this point he was talking about another day not today 
He then texted back it’s up to me he’d still like to see me. But too stupid to not call after what I said 
I believe he was purposely trying to feel control because his manipulative attempt to get in my apartment failed 
I am very distrusting 
I need some one who doesn’t feel the need to do this crap 
I’m starting to think all old guys are douchy like that

1mihcj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayTechTried/comments/1mihcj8/assess_the_best_coffee_maker_for_small_spaces/,Assess the Best Coffee Maker for Small Spaces with Elite Gourmet,"Brewing coffee just got a lot more convenient with the Elite Gourmet EHC4128. If you’re like me and enjoy starting your day or powering through an afternoon with a perfectly brewed cup of coffee, this little machine might pique your interest. I’ve tested it extensively, and while it genuinely delivers a great cup of joe, there are things you should know before making it a permanent part of your kitchen lineup.

**Compact Design and Space Saver**  
Living in a small apartment or working in a cramped office kitchen makes space one of the most precious commodities. The design of this coffee maker brings a compact form factor without sacrificing functionality. Measuring just 8"" x 9"" x 6,"" it nests comfortably in tight areas, taking up minimal counter space. Its sleek appearance adds modern flair, and honestly, it looks much more expensive than it actually is. I even took it on a camping trip in our RV, where it fit perfectly in a small cabinet. For someone who has no patience for clunky appliances, this is a big win.

**User-Friendly Operation**  
Operating this coffee machine is as simple as it gets. It’s fully automatic and controlled with just an on/off button—no confusing settings to fiddle with at 6 a.m. Its semi-transparent water reservoir makes it easy to measure exactly how much water you need for up to 4 cups of coffee, and the water level indicator ensures I never go overboard. I love that I can get my coffee brewing within seconds of walking into the kitchen, which is essential during hectic mornings.

[Check Elite Gourmet EHC4128 price on Amazon.](https://triopd.com/p/b0czqctd4k/)  

**Reusable Filter for Eco-Friendly Brewing**  
My favorite thing about this model is the built-in reusable filter. Not having to hunt for paper filters every time I’m out is a relief. The reusable filter is easy to clean, and since it’s built to last, I’ve saved some money while reducing waste. It’s a feature that resonated deeply with my environmentally conscious sister, who insisted on borrowing the coffee maker for a week.

**Pause 'N Serve and Keep Warm Features**  
One standout aspect has been the Pause 'N Serve function. When I feel impatient—who hasn’t wanted an immediate cup halfway through brewing?—this allows me to pour a quick mug without making a mess. I can confirm it works like a charm; no drips were left behind. Additionally, the Keep Warm function surprised me. If I forget about my coffee, which happens more often than I care to admit, it stays comfortably hot and ready to drink for at least an hour post-brew.

**Merits**  
- Compact and stylish design ideal for small spaces  
- Reusable filter promotes cost and environmental savings  
- Ease-of-use with a straightforward operation  
- Pause 'N Serve feature for coffee on demand  
- Keep Warm function preserves temperature for extended enjoyment  

**Caveats**  
- The 4-cup capacity might feel limiting for larger households  
- While functional, the on/off button doesn’t offer programmability  
- Lightweight build feels less durable compared to premium models  

**Consistently Delicious Coffee**  
The quality of coffee this little appliance brews was a pleasant surprise for its price point. The carafe holds just the right amount for an individual or a couple, ensuring that coffee isn’t sitting too long and going stale. Each cup was hot and flavorful, rivaling anything I’ve made in higher-end machines. It's fantastic for straightforward coffee lovers who enjoy simplicity and aroma without the drama of specialized brewing gadgets.

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing the Elite Gourmet EHC4128 with similar drip coffee makers, such as the Mr. Coffee 4-Cup and Black+Decker 5-Cup, produces mixed results. The reusable filter in Elite Gourmet's design gives it a clear edge over the Mr. Coffee, saving both money and effort over time. On the other hand, the Black+Decker model offers a stronger build quality but lacks the Pause 'N Serve feature present in this model. Elite Gourmet’s compactness outshines the competition, especially for RV-goers and dorm dwellers, although it slightly falls short with a less robust overall feel.

**Affordable Quality**  
For the features packed into this coffee maker, the pricing feels more than reasonable. Comparable machines often omit features like the Keep Warm option or skimp on the reusable filter, so finding these components bundled in is excellent value. Admittedly, its smaller capacity might not be ideal for households with three or more heavy coffee drinkers, but the combination of features, ease of use, and portability leaves very little room for criticism. For an office desk, dorm room, or petite kitchen, this coffee machine proves to be a remarkable deal.

# CHAPTER 4. (NON)EXTRA DETAILS

Listing all the materials that Mafia 2 lost during development is worthy of a separate book. Let's run through the most egregious cases.

The game starts in Sicily during World War II — we are shown a fragment from Vito's everyday life in combat. The mission lasts five minutes, then the action moves to «civilian life» (by the way, about the confusion of the plot).

As it became clear later, 2K Czech planned to devote about an hour to Sicily. To conduct training in all the mechanics there, dividing it into nine short tasks. One of them was called «Call of Duty».

https://preview.redd.it/vk5t1g1xr8hf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41ad411fd7fa6dbaa0af3d104d69fbb3b4356770

Remember the trinity: the safecracker, the gunsmith, and the junkyard owner? They were responsible for additional missions in the open world. Completing the latter would affect the hero's reputation and give bonuses from a specific employer. A colleague in a dangerous business could be asked, for example, to bring weapons. This explains why Mafia 2 has mechanics using a home phone and phone booths. «You don't know a single number» — this is the message that players saw when picking up the phone in the final version.

Another carelessness is associated with optional activities. If you open the map, and in it the «legend», then in the list of symbols you can see a yellow circle. It marks the «additional task». As you understand, the yellow circle never appears on the map.

[The cover of Mafia 2. The man on the left is the main mystery of the project](https://preview.redd.it/6ee4km78s8hf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cdef251cb57314f5a7b06884590895fcb53cfe8)

Another thing that disappeared in the heat of 2K Czech deadlines was «Beck's Real Estate Agency». In it, the player would buy apartments or houses. Furnish them to his taste. 

Public transport (taxi, buses, metro) was also removed. Hairdressers with the ability to change your hairstyle. Gyms where you can learn new moves. Vito's girlfriend, with whom you need to go on dates.

While cutting the game into pieces, the Czechs also sacrificed journalists — they removed the mission «Wheels on Fire», which was demonstrated to the press at Gamescom 2009. Thanks to it, 2K Czech won the «Best Developer» nomination.

Their main trick is the character standing on the left side of the cover. He is nowhere to be found in Mafia 2. Meticulous «hackermen» found a sound file — a cut dialogue between Vito and Joe. Our stout friend mentions a newcomer, he will take him with him to eliminate Tommy Angelo. If the player refuses to take this task.

[Do you recognize him?](https://preview.redd.it/7eswftsjs8hf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=862b1bc0cf4e5ae449e08e0d622899cf4349e059)

The ending of the second Mafia looks like a stupid stump for a reason. According to Daniel Vavra, the entire last third of the game has nothing to do with his script. He assumed three possible endings depending on the player's decisions:

* «The Best Time»: Joe dies, Vito rises in the criminal hierarchy;

* «Friends for Life»: Vito saves Joe;

* «Family Business»: Joe dies, Vito quits crime, secretly moves away and opens a pizzeria. It's funny that, hiding from the mafia, he calls the establishment by its real name — «Pizza Scaletta». Its model is still in the game files.

# CHAPTER 5. WHAT'S ABOUT THE FACE?

What do we have as a bottom line? What exactly did 2K Czech offer us to play in 2010?

A half-GTA.

Why is that? Because the key task was to find a balance between the hardcore of «Mafia 1» and modern trends. Even in 2002, some of the gameplay decisions of The City of Lost Heaven were discouraging everyone. And in the second half of the 2000s, **Rockstar Games** was already in full swing — while the Czechs were tinkering with different engines, the competitor released **GTA: Vice City**, **GTA: San Andreas** and the largely revolutionary **GTA IV**.

It was the franchise about the great car thief that 2K Czech took as a reference point.

https://preview.redd.it/k9hakrp1t8hf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff1c1167f7b16837a34dabba61e828e09aaaf059

The decision backfired. The team was so eager to please casual gamers, to relieve them of the slightest discomfort, to smooth out all the rough edges, that they completely lost the spirit of the original.

It was not a holy ideal, but it cannot be denied — it had its own face. No mini-map and GPS-navigator — this greatly increased immersion, allowing you to remember the city well. No high-speed cars and brainless police — this greatly increased immersion and forced you to follow traffic rules. No health regeneration and frequent autosaves — this greatly increased the tension from shootouts and narrowed your anus.

Thanks to the above, Mafia 1 was etched into memory for years, for decades to come.

[What other story game made you stop on red lights, not speed, and avoid collisions?](https://preview.redd.it/4f8tr5s6t8hf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ba0431aa51b81657997d05b19ef69a95302988f)

Unfortunately, Mafia 2 is another Lenten GTA clone. You don't need to learn the city, or follow the traffic rules. In a shootout, take the nearest cover and shoot the stupid enemies.

A separate blasphemy is the diegetic music in the open world. Now it's only on the radio, as Rockstar taught. In the original, the beautiful music of the 30s followed you almost continuously. It literally enveloped you, thickening the fabric of the game world. Not a very realistic approach, but the atmosphere was in full swing.

But 2K Czech did not repeat their own trick and for some reason borrowed the pseudo-documentary style of a direct competitor.

[The protracted development forced the publisher to invest in a series of trailers. One of them turned out to be unusually creative](https://reddit.com/link/1mihb6g/video/o0au2ebbt8hf1/player)

Another paradox happened with the second Mafia — the Czechs tried their best to keep up with the times, created a technological Illusion Engine, screwed Nvidia Physx to it... and still were late to the party.

Shooting is a prime example. Each trailer for the game advertised advanced destructibility of objects as the central feature of shootouts. They weren't lying: glass breaks, splinters fly, concrete columns crumble. However, the action of Mafia 2 is sorely lacking in speed, drive, tension, and a sense of struggle. There is sluggish dynamics, predictable game design, and rough enemy animations. You are like in a shooting gallery — shoot schematic dummies until they run out.

As a result, the shooting boasts of newfangled destructibility, but does not offer energetic action. The laziness of the creators is clearly noticeable at the beginning of the last mission. A small group of enemies runs towards the player along a narrow corridor — you easily shoot them, holding down the trigger of the machine gun. All that's missing is a cup of coffee, which Vito will leisurely drink while firing.

https://preview.redd.it/cx90cfhft8hf1.jpg?width=5120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9da4660201800425e715a80b5bb7f0c9810a01b3

The high difficulty level affects exactly one parameter — it speeds up our death. The action does not become more exciting and furious, now we just die in half a second in monotonous shootouts. Sometimes, it is not clear from what. You are sitting behind cover, not bothering anyone — the death screen. A quote from a review by a popular Russian blogger **Maddison** is very appropriate:

>*And now the question: what the \*\*\*\* killed me?! \[…\] There wasn't even a sound! No shot, nothing! Maybe Vito had a heart attack? Or was he killed by the fart of a comrade running in front of him?*

[«You shoot like my sister!»](https://preview.redd.it/wk532cqqt8hf1.jpg?width=5120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=042b110dcbdc92b02708811364e61bdaf7d1bfe1)

Two years before Mafia 2, GTA IV was released — exemplary shooting, with great weapon sounds and groundbreaking body physics. Six months before Mafia 2, **Just Cause 2** was released — a hurricane action cocktail with fun gadgets and luxurious explosions. Three months before Mafia 2, Red Dead Redemption was released — the same cutting-edge body physics and stylish slo-mo. Simply put, in August 2010, there was no reason to shoot as Vito.

While Mafia 1 offered a fundamentally different approach to shooting compared to **GTA 3**, the sequel did not keep up with the action of GTA IV and its contemporaries. You can’t live on destruction alone.

[The warden is voiced by Jason Zumwalt, the voice of Roman Bellic in GTA IV](https://preview.redd.it/alm86l8ot8hf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=debafe1932f551b906099d8d64080180ba80a12a)

The close combat turned out to be completely comical. According to rumors, cold weapons (brass knuckles, knife, crowbar) were cut from the game at the last moment — the team was hastily reworking hand-to-hand fights. They had enough time for an unsightly analogue of a boxing match.

The fights of the second Mafia come down to pressing one of three buttons: light blow, strong blow, dodge. Then, when the opponent is exhausted, we carry out the finishing move — for example, press the left mouse button three times. At the same time, the surrounding world is paused — the fighters do not interact with it in any way. No one will come running to help the opponent. You will not be able to push him anywhere. He will never touch a barrel or a box standing nearby.

It is even more amazing that the monotonous static fights are the only gameplay in one of the chapters. For about 40 minutes, while Scaletta experiences the hardships of life as a prisoner, the player will mindlessly press three buttons. After all, there is nothing to think about.

Even against the background of the aforementioned problems of Mafia 2, its hand-to-hand combat looks like a strange rudiment.

[Dear Hangar 13, If you ever do a full-fledged remake of Mafia 2, please remake Chapter 6](https://preview.redd.it/oifs467zt8hf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f57fc9e8f64ef52be38d33648e7bc640d7a7af2c)

On the other hand, the prison episode somehow stands out among the criminally monotonous missions. Globally, the entire gameplay cycle of the game comes down to the following: we go on a mission, shoot in the corridor, go home to rest. From creativity — we give a lift to a drunk friend who will dirty the interior if you do not stop in time. We throw boxes of cigarettes to our partner from the back of the van, pressing one button. And where would we be without a couple of minutes of single-cell stealth among perfectly placed shelters or enemies with their backs turned.

It seems that at some point there was not a single employee from Illusion Softworks left inside 2K Czech. Mafia 1 constantly threw you something new. Here we are delivering passengers, as befits a real taxi driver. Here we are participating in a difficult race. Here we are sneaking around the estate with a bat in our hands. Here we are waiting on a yacht for the right moment to eliminate the target. Here we are carrying boxes under the guise of a worker so as not to attract unnecessary attention.

Again, some decisions are subject to debate, but the creative courage and freedom that saturated The City of Lost Heaven were no less fascinating than its plot. You never knew what Daniel Vavra would surprise you with next.

There is no need to be surprised in the sequel — everything is sterile here. Both in terms of gameplay and in terms of visuals. Among the locations that you will have to visit, the only thing that enlivens the eye is the planetarium — the last residence of Don Falcone.

In general, the second Mafia creates a feeling of incoherence between game designers and scriptwriters. The gameplay and the plot sometimes do not harmonize at all.

Let's turn to the fifth chapter again. Vito comes to the restaurant to meet with an important authority, hoping to get a place in the Clemente family. The man asks the protagonist if he is ready to kill people on orders. Scaletta answers in the affirmative, explaining his decision by his experience on the fields of World War II. And it seems that the main character is revealed to us, smoothly leading him to the first order of the mafia.

But the drama is ruined by the fact that in the gameplay we have already shot and killed — in the second chapter, when we stole a car from the territory of the enemy gang. Then in the fourth, where the police chased us across the rooftops after the attack on the jewelry store. That is, Vito has already got his hands dirty twice, and we know about it — the scene in the restaurant loses all logic and significance.

https://preview.redd.it/zj274nl6u8hf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5e4f147deff435d67c9b4ca0f6eac899c44344a

Example #2 — Tommy Angelo's death.

Vito and Joe drive up to a private home. A stately pensioner is watering the lawn when Dumb and Dumber approach him from behind. Mr. Salieri sends his regards. Our heroes get into the car... and a chase from the police begins!

From the creators' point of view, it is logical to assume that the player will be shocked by such a plot twist. That he needs to be given time to come to his senses. Maybe turn off the radio in the car. But no — let's completely ruin the atmosphere of the moment with some dirty action.

[No matter how much of a scoundrel Tommy was, he hardly deserved to die at the hands of two stupid thugs who didn't even understand who they were killing and why](https://preview.redd.it/7n04b7p8u8hf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e55c0d87cfbbd758fc934888eeaa60fcbcf6ac9)

Once again — what exactly did 2K Czech offer us to play in 2010? A GTA clone with dull shooting, garish close combat and missions in the spirit of «let’s go shoot».

What story did 2K Czech tell us in 2010? An incomprehensible «drama» with bad dialogues. As if written by teenage Scorsese fans. Without taste, without thought, without emotion.

The loss of Daniel Vávra’s firm hand — his creative force, his manic pedantry — hit the team too hard. And the development of technology coupled with pressure from the publisher sentenced Mafia 2 to the death penalty. Just imagine the fever in which it was finished, if they didn’t have time to remove the «You don’t know a single number» caption and the yellow circle from the list of symbols on the map.

# CHAPTER 6. REQUIEM FOR A DREAM

The game's failure is perceived even more bitterly when you see its potential.

The car physics here are excellent — driving around the city is a pleasure. The developers once again scrupulously worked out the iron horses, paying attention to the nuances of their behavior. Engine power, car weight, maximum speed, type of wheels, their size, torque — all this is taken into account by the Illusion Engine. In other words, the Czechs have outdone themselves.

The graphics here are beautiful — they are still pleasing to the eye. When you drive through a metropolis at night in winter and see how the light from the streetlights or oncoming traffic dissipates, you involuntarily doubt that the game is 15 years old. 2K Czech did not work on the engine in vain — in some graphic aspects, the second Mafia defeated time.

Here, every now and then, there are worthy story scenes. Returning home to the song Let it Snow. The sentencing and arrival at the prison, staged as if we were watching a monumental tragedy. The bombing of a skyscraper office under the guise of window cleaners. The brutal massacre of Henry by Chinese thugs. The murder of Tommy Angelo for the purpose of a fleeting profit.

Alas, these are just scattered fragments of a theoretically good game. There are too few of them to glue together into a coherent picture and make Mafia 2 work.

[The arrest and arrival at the prison is perhaps the best scene of the game](https://reddit.com/link/1mihb6g/video/0f32jzonu8hf1/player)

It's amazing how many ideas and ambitions the Czech team put into their project.

Show Sicily during the Second World War. America in the 40s and 50s, in winter and summer. Imprisonment with a limited open world. Several small groups: Africans, Irish, Chinese. Three large mafia families: Clemente, Falcone, Vinci.

Implement a reputation system. Additional missions from charismatic bandits. Local scenes where the player would help random passers-by. Buying apartments and houses with lots of interactive objects. Instant transition from shooting to close combat and back within any action episode. Dialogue window + choice affecting the ending.

If at least half of the outlined plans had been completed in the final version, Mafia 2 would have become that very «Dream Game». It lived up to all expectations and made my hands tremble at the first launch. It didn't drop the name of its predecessor and proudly stood in line with other hits of 2010.

Perhaps someday **Hangar 13** — the current owners of the franchise — will give us a new Mafia 2. As the remake of the first part showed, they can strain themselves, put their soul into it and do the job, if not brilliantly, then very diligently.

https://preview.redd.it/r8lzl7s8v8hf1.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b55f519eb159deedf5c00bc63e3b24dbeb50be8

Of course, the second Mafia has a nice charm even in this form. Handsome protagonist. His cheerful friend. Atmospheric city. Spectacular destructibility. Several strong episodes.

But a whole bunch of problems and errors, if you remove the veil of nostalgia from your eyes, do not allow you to call the game a success.

A suitable epitaph on its grave would be a quote from **David Semik**, data manager at 2K Czech. Without a good reason, a person would not say something like this during development. Especially, like an advertising campaign, when he must think over every word ten times:

>*During the development of the first Mafia, almost nothing was changed by the publisher \[…\] In the final version, the changes were mostly related to bug fixes rather than cutting game materials. Now, the publisher of Mafia 2 is involved in the development much more than back then. And this, of course, has both its pros and cons.*

I also feel they become motivated more by appearance then they would be otherwise would be. People are naturally inclined to be motivated by doing good work, especially for others, and people tend to become detached from that when they have caffeine.

Comprehensive Review Inside!,"Testing out the APEC WATER ROES-50 has been an interesting experience, to say the least. This particular reverse osmosis system is touted as a top-tier setup, and I was eager to see if it truly lives up to its reputation. I drink a lot of water, so having consistently ultra-clean, great-tasting water at my fingertips seemed like a dream come true. Installing it beneath the sink felt like taking the leap into professional-level water filtration. But let's unravel both the stellar bits and the quirks of this product.

**Ease of Installation**

Setting up this system was less daunting than I initially assumed, even for someone like me who isn't particularly handy. It’s designed for under-sink installation, and while there were quite a few components in the package, the included instructions were straightforward. From the RO unit itself to the 100% lead-free faucet, everything felt solid and high-quality. I did enlist the aid of a coworker who’s more DIY-savvy, which helped in ensuring I didn’t fumble my way through it. If you’re not confident in your plumbing skills, I’d recommend having someone on speed dial. While the installation wasn’t rocket science, it’s tedious if you’re a beginner.

**Advantages**

One of the best aspects of this reverse osmosis system is its stellar filtration performance. It's certified to remove up to 99% of impurities, including arsenic, lead, chlorine, fluoride, and over a thousand other contaminants I can’t even pronounce. Honestly, it’s reassuring knowing the water I hydrate with is practically laboratory-pure.

- The water tastes pure, better than anything I've had from bottled brands.
- Filters handle tap and well water with ease, making it versatile for various households.
- The system is impressively quiet, so there’s no annoying background hum while it works.
- Premium parts like the certified JG tubing reflect its focus on safety and durability.

[Check APEC WATER ROES-50 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b00i0zgozm/)

**Daily Use and Performance**

Once installed, the ROES-50 became a silent workhorse in my kitchen. The tank quietly fills with ultra-clean water, ready for use. Whether I’m brewing a fresh pot of coffee or refilling the cats’ water bowls, I’ve noticed a remarkable difference in taste and clarity. It completely changed how I view tap water – no more weird aftertaste, no odd smells, just pure hydration. However, the flow rate cap at 0.03 gallons per minute did catch me off guard; it’s slower than expected, so don’t expect a gush of water when you use it.

**Drawbacks**

Of course, no product is perfect. While my experience with the APEC WATER system has been overwhelmingly positive, a few issues are worth mentioning.

- Installation, while manageable, still requires a few hours if you're a total novice.
- Slow filtration speed can require some patience when you need large quantities of water.
- The initial flush takes some time as you run the water to clear out impurities from the system's components.

**Build Quality and Design**

The space-efficient “under sink” setup is one of the highlights of this product. It looks professional, even if hidden away from view, and the build feels sturdy. The inclusion of a lead-free faucet is a thoughtful touch, and all components seem durable for long-term use. The system weighs 11.3 kilograms, which isn't exactly lightweight, but I appreciate its solid construction. Measuring at 16 x 5.25 x 17.5 inches, it fits snugly in my under-sink cabinet without taking up excessive room.

**Competing Products**

I’ve looked at other reverse osmosis systems before deciding on this one, and the competition does have its fair share of standouts. For instance, popular brands like iSpring and Waterdrop offer some tough competition. iSpring systems tend to boast larger filtration tanks, which can be helpful for families that consume significant amounts of water. Meanwhile, Waterdrop systems often feature a sleeker design and faster filtration speeds. Compared to these rivals, the APEC ROES-50 has an edge in its superior impurity rejection (up to 99%) and its excellent customer support, which many users have raved about online. However, on the downside, it still lags somewhat in the aesthetic and filtration speed department.

**Value for Money**

Investment in a water filtration system like this one isn’t insignificant. Still, considering the ROES-50 is an affordable heavyweight among reverse osmosis systems, it delivers exceptional value. The filters last longer than expected compared to cheaper systems I’ve used, which ultimately saves money in the long term. No more wasting cash on bottled water or mediocre filter pitchers. Every dollar spent here feels like a smart choice for healthier living and pure hydration.

1mih88k,https://www.reddit.com/r/disabled/comments/1mih88k/uk_domiciliary_carers/,UK Domiciliary Carers,"So, this is going to be unpopular, but hear me out. I am basing this on my experiences over 10+ years, and also speaking to others in the same situation.

Domiciliary care in the UK, specifically carers sent by Local Authorities, are predominantly awful. 
And the unpopular part is that the issue stems from migrants from particular African countries. The vast majority of the carers I have had are all from Nigeria, and 9 out of 10 of them are useless, ignorant, lazy and just lack common sense or they simply do NOT care.

I have had carers from other countries, and the work ethic and care is an absolute chasm apart from the ethic of Nigerian immigrants carers.

On one occasion, I asked for a bowl of tomato soup to be heated up. She poured plum tomatoes ONTO A PLATE and gave me a fork. They were cold.

Another occasion, I asked for a cheese sandwich. The butter was sliced thicker than the bread and the cheese together.
I asked once for a cup of coffee, no sugar. I sat there watching as she put 6 sugars into it, then had a go at me for not drinking it.
I have endless occasions where the work ethos is just non existent. We aren't patients. We are a barrier to them finishing. They say they stay for 20 minutes when it's barely 10. They try to gaslight you. It probably works on senile patients, so they will gaslight them about times etc. Today, for me, they came at half 4 for teatime call, then again at half 5 for evening call. I said there is not much to do in an hour. 'Ah no, we were here at half 3'. My fucking Ring camera recorded them!
Gaslighting is probably the biggest issue. They will lie and lie and lie about anything they have done.
I had one person say he was someone else entirely. Said he didn't do anything cos he wasn't here. I described the fact his left eyebrow has a track mark where it has been shaved off, and he was wearing a gold chain with a cross. The company couldn't deny it, but probably did nothing. Don't try to bullshit a bullshitter.

If you have a relative and they have carers, I strongly suggest having a camera mounted to ensure they are not doing something similar to your loved one. 

Why do I say this? Well, I have had many carers, as I said, but I have NEVER had these issues with people from other countries that care for me. Not a single one! There's no argument, there's no gaslighting, there's no ignoring, there's no laziness. 

Worst of all, they all wear masks, never introduce themselves either.

So, in essence, tldr, the UK care industry is having a massive issue with sub par care caused predominantly by immigrants from Africa.

I do not vote reform, I am a liberal guy. But I also know when people are taking the piss out of the system and I have to say, a large proportion, not all, but a large proportion of them are playing the system. There's no excuse for sub par care giving it that is your role.

Don't get me wrong, there are some truly amazing care workers, but they are very very few and far between.

Ok. Go for it. Hit me with the hate, but I stand by what I said. I feel ashamed because of how it could be perceived, but it needs saying because the facts speak for themselves.

1mih761,https://www.reddit.com/r/SevenCommuniTEA/comments/1mih761/what_are_the_chemical_components_in_tea/,What are the Chemical Components in Tea?,"From the perspective of modern science and analysis, most of the substances in tea leaves are ***organic compounds***. These components form the foundation of tea and further influence the flavor of a cup of tea.

When we brew tea, we can detect many chemical components in the tea infusion. The amount and type of these substances, such as [*polyphenols*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405654520300032), [*amino acids*](https://www.o-cha.net/english/teacha/scientific/teanin.html), [*carbohydrates*](https://teaswing.com/blogs/news/does-tea-have-carbs?srsltid=AfmBOooT54PX5E32Zq7L5NgFzBybJLSgoAMpKH2peypUHqBbhx2_Bx4b), [*caffeine*](https://www.republicoftea.com/blog/tea-library/tea-and-caffeine/tl-039/?srsltid=AfmBOoo6Pu-9TQPEBaWqHwXs_SZo3H1lkSPJ_0ZwV14Uf5XljhNcdqsX), and *aromatic compounds*, determine the overall quality and flavor of the tea.

[China Tea Classics, Shanghai Culture Publishing House, 2011](https://preview.redd.it/o3u5l5ngu8hf1.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f42f334d06baa4510a6c256ebe18131cacc4d36)

The changes in color, taste, and aroma during tea brewing come from these substances:

* Polyphenols give the tea its color and astringency;
* Amino acids bring umami and sweetness;
* Caffeine provides bitterness and stimulation; and
* Aromatic compounds give floral and fruity notes or roasted fragrances.

These are the results of chemical transformations, as well as our efforts in tea processing.

# The Role of Caffeine — No Bitterness, No Tea

People new to drinking tea often describe tea as bitter. This bitterness mainly comes from caffeine, a natural substance in tea leaves. 

Caffeine not only contributes to the bitterness of tea, but also gives it a “returning sweetness” characteristic and refreshing feeling after swallowing. It is a key reason tea is often described as “***refreshing***.” 

However, the caffeine content in tea is generally lower than that in coffee, and due to the influence of tea polyphenols, amino acids, and other components, the bitterness is relatively milder than coffee. Depending on how the tea leaves are stored and brewed, ***caffeine may also undergo different chemical reactions***, which may alter the bitterness and sweetness of the tea.

[White Tea Leaves](https://preview.redd.it/ommlf801v8hf1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=766ed3bbd2185b803bf712f3e651a811c45f54be)

# The Secret of Tea Aroma — Polyphenols

Polyphenols are the key to tea aroma. They are the “aromatic code” of tea. There are ***over 30 types of volatile substances*** in tea leaves. The overall content of these in tea is much lower than that of caffeine or polyphenols, but they greatly affect the fragrance and style of the tea. 

Typically, the more types and greater amounts of volatile compounds, the richer and more complex the tea’s aroma becomes.

Large-leaf tea varieties generally contain more volatile compounds than small-leaf varieties, and this is an important factor that contributes to their more pronounced floral and fruity notes. However, depending on the processing method, the expression of aroma can vary significantly.

# The Source of Umami — Theanine

In 1964, Japanese researchers identified [theanine](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9014247/) in tea leaves as a major source of umami flavor. ***Theanine gives tea its distinctive smooth and mellow taste.*** Unlike other amino acids, theanine is water-soluble and can suppress bitterness while enhancing the overall flavor of tea.

Theanine contributes to a soft, sweet taste and helps release a pleasant aroma. It is often found in teas with prominent umami notes, such as gyokuro or shaded teas. Teas with higher theanine content typically have a gentler and more complex flavor profile.

*\*\*Please note that theanine and tea-realted products are not medicinal substances and cannot be used as substitutes for medication in treating diseases.*

# White Tea — A Friend of Time

Every year, Seven TeaHouse's team travels to Fuding, Fujian during the harvest season to purchase white tea, which we then store in warehouses to age and sell after a few years. As time passes, both the flavor and aroma of the tea continue to transform and deepen.

[Fuding, Fujian](https://preview.redd.it/qm5826a3v8hf1.jpg?width=950&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=462c0c5fa32c310f300f6e03f1a1ee18dbcf2c84)

Like how time enriches all things, youthful white tea matures into a smoother, more refined brew. Its fresh floral notes deepen into rich, mellow aromas. Aged white tea is prized for its soothing quality and growing rarity, especially those aged over a decade.

Ofc i smiled back, and left, and since then, im obsessed… I returned the same day but he wasn’t there anymore, just a girl his age smiling at me differently, id say they either both have a crush on me, or they gossip about me

And now i really don’t know what to do, i don’t have balls to make the move, omg if only i knew for sure if he’s into guys id already ask him out, maybe he thinks the same way, but maybe he’s just being nice and im being delusional, i know i wont make that first move, at least not until im sure or maybe if i found him online, but i don’t even know his name What can i do?

My husband’s parents have never liked me. From day one, they’ve treated me like some outsider who “tricked” their precious boy into marriage. My MIL (let’s call her Linda) once told me at Thanksgiving that she “wouldn’t be surprised if he came to his senses.”

Some backstory, we got married six months ago. We had a beautiful wedding… except for the fact that my in laws “forgot” to bring the check for their part of the catering bill and my husband had to put it on his credit card. Whatever. I wanted to move on and enjoy the honeymoon.

We went to Hawaii. Day two, my phone starts blowing up. It's MIL calling me nonstop. I finally answer thinking it’s an emergency. She says “Oh! We’re here! Where are you guys?”

I’m like, Here where?

They. Flew. To. Hawaii. They thought it would be fun to surprise us and make it a family honeymoon.

We spent the next five days dodging them at the resort, only for them to “accidentally” book a snorkeling tour at the exact same time as ours.

Now fast forward to a month ago when my husband and I went on a little trip over the weekend. When we got back home I noticed little things are off in our house. Coffee mugs in different spots, blankets folded differently, couch cushions moved. I thought maybe my husband moved some things around before we left. So i just brushed it off. Obviously now im convinced it's her but anyways.

Then last week, I came home early from work and heard someone upstairs. My heart dropped. I grab the heaviest thing I can find and snuck up the stairs.

It’s my MIL.
In my bedroom.
Wearing my robe.
Sitting on my bed.

She’s casually scrolling through her phone like it’s completely normal. When i asked what she was doing, she goes “Oh honey, I was just waiting for you. I wanted to surprise you by cleaning up a little. And your bed is so comfy, I just had to try it!”

I tell her to leave immediately. She acts offended and says she “has a key, so it’s basically her second home.”

I found out later that when we were on our honeymoon that they had a spare key made from the one we left for my SIL to water our plants.

My husband is still trying to defend them, saying they’re just overly involved and meant well.

I told him straight up either the locks get changed, or I’m changing my last name back.

The constant notifications, reliance on a stable internet connection, and frankly, the time spent troubleshooting outweighed‍ the benefits.

So, I scaled back. Now,I focus on areas where smart tech genuinely simplifies my life. For example, smart‍ lighting in ⁢high-traffic areas like hallways controlled‌ by motion sensors ⁢is‍ fantastic. It's convenient and energy-efficient. I also find‌ a smart thermostat to be a real money⁣ saver, especially with the automatic adjustments ‍based on my schedule.

For years, my focus was purely on raising him, building my business, and keeping life afloat. Dating wasn’t a priority, and honestly, after a while, it didn’t even feel like a possibility.
But when my son got older, and life settled into a new rhythm, I (cautiously) gave Bumble a try. I wasn’t expecting much. I figured if anything, I’d meet some decent people, maybe have a few awkward coffee dates, and that would be it.

Then I met Rene (52M). He’s Deaf. I’m hearing.

From the start, everything about how we communicated had to be intentional. No rapid-fire texting. No mindless chit-chat. Every conversation was deliberate, patient, and present. It was so different from what I expected dating to feel like—but it also made me realize how much of connection is built in the pace, not the performance.

We’re now married, blending families, and continuing to learn together every day. And while life is still beautifully imperfect, I’ve realized that finding love later in life isn’t about “catching up” to some timeline. It’s about realigning to what matters.

I wanted to share this for anyone else who’s ever felt like, “Maybe I’m too late for this.” You’re not. But you might have to approach it differently.

1migvwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1migvwk/visited_my_longdistance_bf_and_he_treated_me/,Visited my longdistance bf and he treated me cruelly the first morning.. I am in peaces and losing my mind..,"Hi,

Please tell me what you think amd what my next step should/could be…?
This is gonna be long… but i am on the edge of a mental breakdown..probably already happened…

I posted here few weeks ago…wanted to see if theres any improvement. I had a plan,well I told my bf that if we meet I want to have a serious deep talk about our needs and biundaries and how we gonna handle conflict…
So I arrived. Everything was okay. He welcomed me with a home made burger…met him in the garden.. frying the meat. Thiught this was really sweet.. I jumped on him..kissed him and all. He kinda said “ssssh dont shout babe ( i was just really happy not shouting) i know ur happy but im “in a little but diffrnt mood now and tired”, kissed me back.. but made me feel like im a bit too much ( this always happens when we meet..) he said its 10pm try to keep it down a bit.. i was a bit like hmm wow. But didnt surprise me.
His brither was there too so when we went upstairs he sat in the armchair, i sat on the coucb with his brother.. so basically we couldnt really cuddle and u know
enjoy” the first moments/hours.. privately. It felt so bad but not his fault.. ( me sitting there seperate and cant even touch him or kiss cuddle etc. hiwever he could have tried sit next to me.. anyway) his brother left the room and my bf was joking saying whatsup bab i can see ur suffering there.. he knows me.. come give me a kiss.. and will sit woth me soon when we watch a movie)
Night goes by chill he sits next to me we cuddle and go bed.
Reason i write this down too because i feel likenit really shows the contract as to what happened the next day… and why my mind is splitting.. and im experiencing cognitive dissonance of sort and cant comprehend the hot and cold.. and how is this the same person compared to this night before.
So the real fuckery started in the morning.

He wakes up, i am half awake too.I see him situp, and leave the room. I ddnt say a word thiught hes just going toilet surely he’ll come back. I already felt kinda bad and not good when he sat up…i missed him so fkin much i wanted to kiss him and cuddle a bit when he woke..but ddnt think much to it as I was convicned he ll come back before he gets coffee.. ( we had this thing for years where i likento wakeup first and the first thing when i open my eyes,i want us to kinds “acknowledge each other happy to see the other one and give kiss or cuddle and then get coffee and drink together) he knows this. Then i see him head downstairs…i was like wow..it hurt. Some people might think this is stupid.. but I cant help it I was always like this and dont care what anyone says, I LOVE waking up next to the person I love and see his face and if he gets up and leave thats cool but not even glancing at me… after not seeing each other for 1momth+ ( 5years of long distance). I felt unspecial.. like he isnt really that happy to see me next to him..? I dont know how to put it..like appreciative?after such a long time;it isnt like we live together..Anyway i messge him asking where he is, and why he just left.. and i wNted to wake up together and cuddle a bit before coffee.. he said he brings coffee and his phone was ringing etc. I couldnt help but the feeling of looking beside me and im alone as I am everyday.. i wanted this to be special, so i ddnt want to but i cried a bit.. He comes in. He lays next to me bit distanced, i say goodmorning and thanks for the coffee. I tell him how i Feel. Calmly gently, my voice shaked a bit. He doesnt even come near or hug me or i donno.. show any affection. Sits there blankly like im a stranger or someth and starts off by sayin “this isnt okay. I think u have some problem.. yiu need to talk about this in therapy.. crying isnt okay because of this and I didnt do anytg wrong judt brought coffee.” - his voice is robotic cold.. and inwa sso naive i thiught he will just give me a hug and say “aw its okay babe dont cry i know u love waking up together i just wanted to nring coffee “ or someth like this cuddle and we move past. But. Him started completely ignore and shrug what im sayin sitting nex tto me not even a touch.. nothing. im like no please dont talk therapy i just wanted to express how infelt.. He says “dint you start this.. my brother is here and dont humiliate me in front of my family” Im like what? Im not doing anythg but u came in and ur so cold.. and he said “are you stupid? Dont u understand my phine rang i went out went to toilet and decided to bring coffee”
Im like.. wow didu u just call me stupid? You been critizing me for somethg little like a tear and some feelings for 20m and u havent even touched me or show any comfort.. he says “then come here so. Ican hug u” I couldnt.. at this point i felt so unvisible and not missed or appreciated… or heard..beint told stupid. i said i cant hug anymore.. he stormed out said hes not doing this. Amd I sat there.. with tears.. and im not joking he left me on our firsg morning for 3 fckin hours….. I didnt follow him i didnt cause a scene… he was in the other room..with his brother. Came back 2 times said “what do u want?” I said just come and hug me and dont treat me like this.. he said he cant argue now.. cuz he hasnt dione anythg.. and if I dont “stop this” then i should leave the house..
He abandond me there i started crying and says i should stop? And leaves. I felt like this is some dark cruelty..  He kept messaging we kept going bck amd forth on chat… whilst he sitting in the other room… at this point hes sending me chatgpt aceenshots how I am unstable.. dramatic.. manipulative..?? Because of a coffee? It WASNT the coffee i got that.. it was the way he came in and was so dann cold and left me there.. i told him this is very cruel considering the circumstances and i just flew here from abroad.. and what did i possibly do so wrong that he punishes me like this?! I couldnt take it anymore i begged him to come in for a few min just to clear things and hug each other.. he didnt.
I left the hiuse i started having panick attacks and sat down somehere on the street with my luggage. I ciudlnt move or drive or get on public transport i felt frozen and sick, and started hyperventialting.. 
it was hot. The sun and all made me dizzy so i looked for shade and sat there. He kept messaging me how he doesnt giv an f anymore and i am terrible and very very unstable and he isnt gonna “bend “ “or give in” - i am totally utterly cinfused and panicking dont even know what i did so bad to deserve this..” i tell him im feeling sick and pls dont do this… he keeps sendjng me chatgpt again..not even listening to me. Says i “can come back” but he isnt backing down..  and not gonna force him to change “his point”
I dont even understand whats THE point here…
and if i dont like this I can take it or leave it..
im thinking..: “backing down from what..? i sit there in peaces.. in shock.. wtf is going on.. its like yesterday the burger and all chill… and in the morning competely 180… i didnt blame him for going coffee.. i just tried to tell him how i wished to cuddle a bit ( when he goes coffee and comes back we dont cudle anymore its diffrnt) Anyway.
After 2 hours… he switches and says. 
“Bab.. its okay… im not mad at u… come back pls… pls.. send me ur location etc.
I am feeling faint.. ao sick of the heat and the despare.. he comes gets me, takes me in.. cuddle me and all kisses me give me water etc… then says i shudnt talk about any of this now…
Then says “the days been ruined”
Im like this isnt my fault…
He shows me his chatgpt… reads it all up… constantly blaming me how its ALL ME, And i need help seriusly… and his chatgpt saying I am deeply manipulative and doing “powergames” carrying my baggage of traumas… and being draamtic…
But fails to tell chatgpt the WHOLE picture of how HE left me for hours… lying that i call him cruel BECAUSE of coffee… twists it all.. i said hes being cruel for his reactions and leaving me because i statted crying…
He says he cant deal with the tears… im anniying amd it triggers him..etc. and if hes so bad… why am i with an abuser??? That i have big issues staying with him..? 
I been talking about couples therapy.. he says its not what i need… and he cant put up with my crying its stupid..
that evtg 80% my fault… and he doesnt need because he is LIKE this and dont wanna change dont wanna put up with crying. I didnt cry much st all at the beginning, just few tears rolled down.. started crying when he called me stupid and left the room..
and i am very sick.. he says sorry 11pm since 11am… and asks to hug.. but im so numb. Im dissociating… we go bed i am exhausted. And terrified of the whole thing… cant process it. We sleep together.. and he kisses me in the morning and goes work. 
Hes comung back home now. Our flight is in 5 days return to my place… he meant to stay there for a while.. but just yesterday he said i dont understand that this isnt gonna work cuz im nit doing proper therapy… ( i will do my individual therapy… vbut got fedup cuz eveytime i go i am asvised to bring my bf… and he refuses to)
I am in fkin pieces. Complteley broken. 
Our first morning…? I am so stupidly naiv to think he will be all sweet when he comes in the room with the coffee… lays nex to m le and comforts me a bit.. i listen, and we start the day… instead he treated me like some stranger and annoyance and coudlnt even put his hand on me??? 
I am very disturbed and terrified that the man i missed so badly… was looking forward meeting and wake up next to.. treated me like a piece of shit…
and my mind is breaking…
My brother tells me to leave him immediately…. I know… i need to… dont know how…. Hes either sweet or cruel… and i keep getting confused if the problem is me… cuz then i feel like i can solve this by changing…? Thats why i dont know if i should leave… maybe its all me then i can save this thing…. 
But this little things like morning… and show joyful emotions when we meet.. ( nit feeling like im too much when i jump on him ..) they are cincerning me… and I DONT WANT TO change it… i love loving so deeply…:
😪

I know what to do…. I just needed to get this off my chest… i need to hear at least how people wiuld percieve this situation objectively….
If anyone made it this far. Please tell me something…

1miguwl,https://i.redd.it/x2py6n5rs8hf1.png,"He Cheated, I Glowed Up. Looking for the link to this novel, please share if available.","“I broke up with Dustin. Draft the agreement. You have to marry me off to someone else.”

“Heleina… if I make this call, there’s no going back,” Andrew said. My brother’s voice was low but stern.

I didn’t hesitate. “I don’t care who it is. Just make sure he’s powerful enough to ruin Dustin’s life by standing next to me.”

When I opened my eyes that morning, everything came crashing back.

Bianca’s laugh.

Dustin’s betrayal.

Her on his desk like it was hers to claim.

The bouquet slipping from my fingers—white peonies hitting the floor like a soft, tragic ending.

The horn.

The headlights.

The sound of my world shattering on impact.

I thought I died, but I didn’t.

They think they won. What they don’t know is—I’m done being the girl who chases. Who pleads. Who forgives easily. I learned to raise my standards now.

Regret would be the bitter pill they need to swallow.

Because in four weeks, I’m getting married.

And he’s definitely not invited…

\--

It was his promotion. His big moment. And I couldn’t wait to celebrate it with him.

The bouquet in my hand was wrapped in white silk. I chose peonies because Dustin prefer giving it to me on special occasions. For lunch, I’d ordered Wagyu sliders and truffle fries from that pop-up bar he couldn’t stop talking about.

I even wore the black satin dress he said made his heart skip. I could already picture it—his surprised smile, the tug of his arms, the familiar kiss behind my ear.

The elevator chimed as it stopped at the 16th floor of Montenegro Media Tower. Dustin’s office was at the far end of the hallway.

“Congratulations, love,” I whispered, rehearsing it like a line in a play.

His secretary’s desk was empty. Strange. But I pushed the thought aside. His door was slightly ajar.

Perfect, I thought. This’ll be cute.

I stepped closer. Reached for the handle.

And froze on the spot.

A woman’s soft, flirty laugh slipped through the crack in the door. My pulse raced. A cold knot twisted in my gut.

“Come on, Dustin. Don’t act like you don’t miss it when I fix your tie.”

I knew that voice…

Bianca.

My cousin.

My childhood plus-one.

The one who used to copy my handwriting because she said it looked expensive. The one who always wanted what was mine.

Something inside me cracked. But I managed to push the door open anyway. Neither of them moved.

“Oh,” Bianca said with a grin, her voice sticky-sweet and poisonous. “Heleina! What a surprise. To whom do we owe this sudden visit?”

My throat tightened. “Am I interrupting something?”

Dustin straightened like a schoolboy caught cheating. “Heleina—I didn’t know you were coming today.”

I almost broke right there. But I didn’t. I walked inside slowly, like nothing in me had just collapsed. I set the bouquet and lunch on the side table with shaking hands.

Bianca hopped off the desk and smoothed her skirt. “It’s not what it looks like.”

“Really?” I laughed weakly. “But why do you seem defensive, dear cousin?""

Bianca crossed her arms. “Oh, yeah? Maybe you’re just overreacting.”

Dustin tried to step in. “Babe, we were just talking—”

“Do you always lean in that close when you talk?” My voice cracked. God, I hated that.

Bianca gave me a hard look—like I was a tantrum in heels. “You’re always so emotional, Heleina. It's exhausting.”

I swallowed hard. “Sorry. Am I boring you while you seduce my boyfriend?”

“Ex,” she corrected casually. “Let’s be real. Dustin’s been halfway out the door for months.”

I turned to him. He didn’t deny it. I stared at them. The scent of peonies filled the room. Sweet. Wrong. Mocking. I picked up the bouquet. Stared at it. Then gently, quietly, dropped it into his trash bin.

Dustin took a step toward me. “Heleina—”

“No.” My voice was barely a whisper. “Don’t.”

I backed away and walked out.

And the moment the elevator doors slid shut, I let go. Hot tears came before I could stop them. I realized, I was trying too hard ignoring the red flags I’d been collecting like secrets.

The sky had opened up by the time I stepped out of the building. Rain soaked the silk of my dress, my hair clinging to my neck. I didn’t care. I walked straight into the storm like it could wash the betrayal off me.

I wasn’t thinking clearly. I stepped off the curb.

Then everything exploded. A horn blared. Brakes screamed. Pain hit me like a wave—white-hot and disorienting. I fell hard, my elbow slamming against the pavement. I tasted blood. The world spun sideways.

Someone was shouting. A man knelt beside me. “Miss? Are you okay? Don’t move—don’t move!”

I blinked up, trying to breathe. Trying to understand how everything had gone so wrong in one day. My pride was shattered; my heart was cracked.

And I was lying in the middle of a the street like every cliché I used to laugh at. I reached into my soaked purse and pulled out my phone with shaking fingers. There was only one person I could call.

“Andrew,” I exclaimed when he answered. “I—I need a favor.”

“Heleina?” My eldest brother’s voice sharpened. “What happened? Are you hurt?”

“I need… I need to you arrange my marriage to someone.”

“What?”

I paused, coughing through tears. “I don’t care who it is. Just—make it someone powerful enough to ruin Dustin’s life by existing next to mine.”

“Heleina… if I make this call, there’s no going back.”

“I won't. Let me marry this guy before I die.”

I closed my eyes, letting the phone slide against my hand.

Chapter 2: The Stranger I'll Marry

My body shook from where it hurts. Hospitals make you feel like you're on pause like—hooked up to wires, wrapped in gauze, lying in a bed that smells like bleach and pity. The moment I opened my eyes that morning, I remembered everything.

Dustin’s office.

Bianca’s smug smile.

The bouquet hitting the floor.

Then the horn, the flash of headlights—

And finally, the silence.

That kind of betrayal doesn’t just break your heart. It dissolves your dignity. I’d built my life around being put together. The polished daughter. The quiet achiever. The loyal girlfriend. All that cracked in one afternoon.

I was still staring at the ceiling when the door creaked open. I turned my head slowly. Expecting Andrew but it wasn’t my brother. It was him—the man I’m going to wed with.

Charismatic. Hot. Intimidating. Dressed in black from head to toe. Hair tousled like he hadn’t bothered to fix it. And eyes—sharp, silver-gray, and unsettlingly steady—that made me forget to breathe.

“You’re Heleina,” he said flatly, his voice deep, quiet, and utterly unimpressed.

I straightened in bed, ignoring the pain in my ribs. “And you must be the favor I—”

“Silas Provetsky,” he cut in in a stern voice.

He didn’t fidget. Didn’t glance at his phone. Just stood there with the unsettling calm of someone used to walking into rooms filled with tension and walking out the same way he came in—untouched.

“I thought you’d be older,” I said.

“I thought you’d be smarter.”

“Excuse me?”

“Marrying someone out of spite?” He raised a brow. “Sounds like a long, expensive way to prove you weren’t the boring girlfriend.”

I stiffened. “You don’t know anything about me.”

“I know enough,” he said, eyes dropping to the bruises peeking out from my hospital gown. “Andrew filled me in.”

“Of course he did.”

I studied him, the sharp angles of his face, the way he refused to meet my gaze for too long. He was guarded. Closed-off. But not indifferent. His eyes kept flicking to my wrist, wrapped tight in gauze. To the IV in my arm. To the bruise blooming across my collarbone. He noticed everything. Even when he pretended not to care.

“And you said yes?” I asked, voice tight.

“I said I’d talk.”

“Right,” I muttered. “Talk to the girl with the wrecked pride and a concussion. What a dream proposal.”

He didn’t even smile. Just looked at me like I was a folder to be read, filed, and forgotten.

“You want a name,” he said. “I have one.”

“And you want…?”

He tilted his head. “Nothing.”

I stared at him. “No agenda? No clause in fine print? No bitter ex or revenge fantasy of your own?”

“I told you already. Don’t make me repeat myself.”

His presence made me nervous, but it also intrigued me. Silas was ice in human form—but not the kind that melted. I could see it in the way he stood—tense but effortless. Like a man who loved to court danger.

“What’s your story?” I asked quietly.

He looked away, jaw tightening. “Not relevant.”

“Everything’s relevant,” I said. “Especially if I’m going to sign your last name like it’s a armor.”

He didn’t speak for a long moment. Then finally—“Let’s get something straight. I don’t lie. I don’t cheat. And I don’t promote love.”

“Why?” I asked, voice soft.

He turned back to me, and something flickered in those storm-gray eyes. Just a flash.

“Because people who love me end up broken.”

I swallowed hard. And there it was—the shadow. His wounded soul seeped through me. I should’ve pulled away. But I leaned forward instead.

“Good,” I whispered. “Because I’m already broken. Now I just want to make sure Dustin regrets leaving me this way.”

Silas gave a short nod. “It’s a deal, then.”

He walked toward the door. Something tugged at me before he left. Maybe it was curiosity. Or the fact that for the first time since Dustin, someone saw me without flinching.

“Wait,” I said.

He paused. I didn’t know what I wanted to say. I just knew I wasn’t ready for him to go.

“You don’t have to pretend,” I said quietly. “You came here because Andrew asked. But you stayed longer than two minutes. That means something.”

He didn’t turn around. But I noticed his hand tighten slightly on the doorknob.

Then he said, “You should rest. I’ll have the paperwork sent tomorrow.”

I lay back against the pillows, staring at the ceiling again. Only this time, it didn’t feel so cold. So suffocating. Something about him stayed with me. Something dangerous yet calming.

Strange but I want to feel it more. I squeezed my eyes shut and then—

The door slammed open. Andrew rushed in, face tight. I jolted and scooted on the bed.

“You have to see this, Heleina.”

“What—what is it?”

He pulled out his phone and shoved it in front of me. The screen showed Bianca—on live. Drunk. Screaming her heart out at a party held at the Green Mansion—my parent’s hotel.

‘…And Heleina? She’s not even sick, okay? She threw herself in front of a car to get attention. Dustin was going to leave her anyway—she knew it! She just can’t stand being second best.’

Silas scoffed and then looked at me. “You just went viral for the wrong reason, Heleina.”

He saw me at my lowest point as a woman...

Yet he still chose to stay and stand as my groom.

Chapter 3: Never Break a Deal

I stared at Bianca’s pixelated face on Andrew’s phone screen. She was laughing like my life was a punchline. And behind her, that glittering Green Mansion backdrop—the same venue I helped plan for her 25th birthday—burned like betrayal in high definition.

Andrew slowly lowered the phone, his mouth tight. “She’s out of control.”

I handed the phone back to Andrew with trembling fingers. “They think I did this for attention.”

“They don’t matter,” Andrew said firmly. “This will die down in a week.”

“Bianca will keep feeding it. She’s wanted my place since we were ten. She even used the Green Mansion to humiliate me,” I said under my breath.

Silas was leaning against the wall now, arms crossed, quiet as ever. But when he spoke, the words cut straight through the room. “She didn’t humiliate you, Heleina,” he said. “You let her win.”

Andrew, ever my shield, stepped forward. “Hey, take it easy bud—”

Silas said calmly, not even looking at him. “If she’s going to marry me, she needs to decide whether she’s playing victim… or taking the upper hand.”

I felt the heat rush to my cheeks. Not from embarrassment, but from the sharp sting of the truth sitting between us. He didn’t say it with judgment. Not even with malice. Just a blunt fact. Like someone reading your flaws aloud so you’d stop pretending they weren’t there. I looked up, meeting his intent gazes.

“You don’t want to walk into that wedding like a scandal,” Silas said and continued, “You want to walk untouched.”

He was right. My whole life, I played nice, elegant, controlled. But something inside me stirred. I wanted to cut the curse and choose myself this time.

I pulled the hospital blanket tighter around me. “When will the paperwork be ready?”

Silas didn’t blink. “First thing in the morning tomorrow. Prenup, confidentiality, name change options. I’ll have my lawyer send the draft.”

“Good,” I said.

Andrew clenched his jaw. “You’re actually going through with this?”

I turned to him, eyes defiant. “What do you want me to do? Wait for Bianca to throw me under another bus—literally?”

Andrew looked at me, his worry folding into quiet frustration but he didn’t argue.

Silas stepped closer to the bed. “I’ll handle the public angle. Keep your name out of the worst circles. But I need to know something, Heleina.”

I tilted my head. “What?”

“Once we sign this, you have to stick around. Can you handle the consequences?”

His words were stern, but his gaze lingered just a second too long on the bruise at my collarbone.

I didn’t blink when I said, “Yes. Let’s do this together, Mr. Provetsky.”

He watched me for a long beat. Then finally nodded and left.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The next morning, my house felt too quiet. Just the echo of my own thoughts bouncing off the walls. Then—three sharp knocks pulled me out of my trance. I opened the door, and there he was again—Silas Provetsky, dressed in slate gray today, hair wind-swept, a leather folder in his hand.

“Good morning,” he said in that flat, deep voice. “You’re awake.”

I didn’t answer right away. I’d barely slept. But I stepped aside, letting him in.

He walked in like he belonged. Eyes scanning the place. “Your interior designer had taste.”

“That’s me,” I said, following him. “She got dumped and redecorated instead.”

“Effective coping mechanism,” he muttered. Then held out the folder. “The prenup.”

I took it, flipping through. Clean terms. Asset separation. Confidentiality clause. Joint appearances for press. No romantic expectations. Just signatures and privacy.

“Clear enough?” he asked.

“Yes.” I looked up. “Can I buy you lunch?”

His brows lifted, just slightly. “Why?”

“Because I hate looking like the tragic one,” I said, grabbing my coat. “If the city’s already talking about me, they might as well get the next chapter right.”

We ended up in a quiet corner of a high-end restaurant inside Rockwell. Despite everything, it was… almost normal. He didn’t smile, but he asked if my head still hurt. And when I laughed at something the waiter said, he looked up—just briefly—and nodded like the sound surprised him.

Then, as if summoned by every bad decision I’ve ever made, Bianca walked in. She spotted me first. She sauntered over to our table like a woman with a camera crew behind her.

“Well, this is new,” Bianca said, feigning shock and amusement. “You’re out? Didn’t you just survive a car fiasco?”

I ignored her and took a sip of my drink.

She turned to Silas and gave him a once-over, practically playing with her lips. “And who’s this? Your latest publicity stunt?”

Silas didn’t flinch. He reached for his coffee calmly, like her presence bored him.

“He’s my fiancé,” I said, voice firm.

Bianca let out a high-pitched laugh. “You’re kidding. You got engaged? Didn’t know bandages came with diamond rings now.”

My jaw clenched. “Leave me alone, Bianca.”

“Oh, no,” she said sweetly. “I’m just getting started, dear cousin.” She turned her eyes on Silas. “You must not know what you’re getting into. Heleina’s idea of love is crashing her own pity party and playing victim until someone feeds her compliments.”

Silas leaned back slowly and then looked her straight in the eye. “She doesn’t need compliments. She needs peace of mind. Something you’re clearly unfamiliar with.”

Bianca blinked. “Excuse me?”

“You heard me,” Silas said, voice like smoke. “She didn’t ask for your opinion. And unless you're on the menu, I suggest you find another table.”

I nearly choked on my iced tea. Bianca’s face went stiff. But before she could come up with another insult—another voice sliced through the air.

“Heleina.”

I turned and saw another nightmare—Dustin. He stood in the middle of the restaurant clad in his wrinkled shirt and a stoic face.

He took a step closer and held my hand. “I saw the posts. The press is blowing everything up.”

“Must be tough dealing with backlash after you cheated in a suit and tie,” I said, pulling my arm away.

Bianca cut in, scoffing. “Heleina, don’t be so overly dramatic—”

“Shut up, Bianca,” Dustin snapped. His voice was quiet, but sharp enough to silence her.

Then, he turned to me. “Can we talk?”

Silas rose from his seat. “She’s eating.”

Dustin ignored him and kept on bugging me. “I want closure, Heleina. Besides, this has nothing to do with him.”

“It does now,” Silas said. Calm. Cold. Dangerous. “She’s my fiancée.”

The word sting like a wine splashed on the wound. People started to notice. Phones were subtly lifted. I swallowed hard, keeping my poise in place.

“Unbelievable. One week out and you’re already marrying him? Who even is this guy?”

“Give me a break, Dustin,” I said. “Whatever you want to say, you’re three betrayals too late.”

He opened his mouth again—and a loud click of a camera went off. Someone had taken a picture. Another. Then two more. Bianca looked around, suddenly panicked.

I took a breath, straightened my spine, and said, loud enough for everyone to hear, “Come, love. Let’s not ruin our engagement lunch.”

Silas didn’t hesitate. He slid his arm across my back, guiding me away from the table.

But as we stepped out into the crowd, Dustin shouted behind us—

“Heleina, wait—You don’t know who you’re marrying!”

Chapter 4: She's Been Wifed

Dustin’s voice echoed through the restaurant. I stopped mid-step. Silas didn’t speak. But something shifted in the air between us. The kind of silence that felt loaded, like a firearm waiting to go off.

I turned slowly. My heart was stammering inside my chest. “What did you say?”

Dustin looked directly at me. “You don’t know what he’s done.”

I looked at Silas but he didn’t flinch—just a flicker in his eyes. He stepped forward. Calm. Measured. He pulled something from his coat pocket—a small, square box in velvet black. He popped it open. I burst out, causing the restaurant to blur around us.

Inside the box was a ring that didn’t belong in real life. A cushion-cut blue diamond, center-set, haloed in icy white stones that glittered like frost under fire. The band curved like a crown. It looked like it had a backstory, a body count, and a security vault of its own.

Someone at a nearby table whispered, “That’s not just a ring… that’s a museum piece.”

Another said, “That’s the Winston Lucille diamond—didn’t it go missing?”

Silas didn’t blink. “Custom reset. Bought it back from a billionaire sheikh. It’s worth just under a billion.” He held the ring out—like he was sealing a contract.

“S-Silas…” I uttered his name softly.

He slipped the ring against my finger and whispered, “For the press. “We’ll announce it next week. But I figured your ex should be the first to see how quickly you upgrade.” His voice was low, almost intimate.

I looked at Bianca, who looked like she’d been slapped with a chandelier. Her jaw dropped. Dustin went silent—staring at the ring like it burned his ego alive.

The cameras clicked again.

Silas leaned in, brushing his lips lightly against my temple—rehearsed and cold, yet... steady. “Let them talk,” he murmured.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The headlines exploded overnight.

Silas Provetsky: The Don to the Provetsky Clan admits his romantic flair with Heleina Montenegro

By the time I woke up, the internet had already made its decision: I was either insane or iconic. No in-between. Silas didn’t message me that morning. He showed up in person. He stood at my condo door in a tailored black coat, holding coffee in one hand and an envelope in the other.

“Filing’s today. You ready?”

“Not really. But we have to move forward with the plan.”

He nodded and ushered me to his car.

At city hall, the fluorescent lights buzzed above us like nervous energy trying to fill the space. Silas sat beside me, calm and unreadable. But once in a while, I caught him glancing at me when he thought I wasn’t looking.

His suit was sharp, charcoal with subtle pinstripes, like he knew this wasn’t just business—it was an image. And next to him, I felt... strange. Not like a bride. But not like a stranger either.

“Raise your right hand,” the clerk said.

I did, even though my palm was clammy. The city hall office smelled like ink and old leather chairs, but everything around me felt surreal—like I was watching someone else’s life unfold.

He didn’t even blink when the clerk asked, “Are you entering this marriage of your own free will?”

“Yes,” Silas answered, his voice smooth, steady.

I cleared my throat and echoed, “Yes.”

The documents were stamped with cold precision. The moment the last seal hit the page, it was done.

No church. No flowers. No vows. Just two signatures, one contract, and a lifetime of unknowns. Now more than ever, I am now officially, Mrs. Provetsky.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The next morning, I woke up to the scent of coffee and a note on my nightstand.

Going into the city. Don’t wait up. —S

I went down to the kitchen barefoot, hair messy, still wearing his oversized hoodie from last night.

And that’s when I saw it. His phone, vibrating on the counter. Silas had left it behind. A message flashed across the screen.

Unregistered Number:

She’s not safe with you. I’m taking her back!

My blood ran cold. It didn’t take a genius to know who the sender was. I was about to end the call but the front gates buzzed to life. I peeked through the glass-panel windows and was rattled by a familiar man standing outside, holding a bouquet of peonies and a giant stuffed toy.

Trying to make it work. Using Celebrex/celecoxib as needed. So rheumatologist says sounds like I'm having nerve pain, in addition to joint pain. She suggested trying gabapentin, 300mg at night. Warned about drowsiness. I got it yesterday and took one 300mg capsule at bedtime. 

30 mins in definitely felt drowsy but also nauseous. But everything makes me nauseous so I took an ondansetron. Fell asleep. Few hours later woke up to use bathroom and I was dizzy and felt...drugged. Just WEIRD.

This morning woke up mildly-dizzy, headache, fatigued, and have the worst deep-ache waist down. My hips, knees, legs, are all ACHING and it's exhausting to walk.

I recently bought the Soundcore Q45 brand new. The sound quality and ANC are pretty good, especially since these are my first Bluetooth headphones. However, I ran into an issue during a phone call at a coffee shop. My headphones were connected to my Android phone via Bluetooth, and I was using the built-in mic to talk. My friend on the other end said the call was full of distortion. For example, he could clearly hear background sounds like a phone ringing in another room or the coffee machine—even though those sounds were barely noticeable to me. He also said my voice wasn’t coming through clearly and that the background noise was really distracting.

I thought these headphones had some kind of noise-cancelling microphone. Is there anything I can do to improve the call quality? A refund isn’t an option since I bought them from a place that doesn't accept returns, so I’m stuck with them for the foreseeable future.

Austin's frown deepened, the weight of old warnings heavy in his expression. He had cautioned me against merging our packs and allowing Brown to become alpha.

""You made a grave mistake, Luna,"" Austin murmured, his voice thick with regret. ""You shouldn't have trusted him or surrendered everything that rightfully belonged to you. Now we're nothing in this pack because of that decision. Alpha Brown will never release you easily.""

A month ago, I had suffered severe blood loss from a stomach ulcer. That day, the healer made countless desperate calls to my mate, pleading for a blood transfusion since we shared the same rare RH-negative blood type. Something we had discovered before we mated.

When Brown finally answered, his voice was dismissive. He claimed he was in a crucial council meeting and couldn't come.

But through our mind-link, agony tore through my wolf's consciousness. Brown wasn't at any council meeting. He was tangled in bed with Mia, my foster sister. It felt as though he was deliberately punishing me for bearing his mark.

The emotional pain was only the beginning. Every hour he pushed into her, visions of their intimacy flooded my mind, accompanied by Brown's whispered words of devotion to Mia. Words he had never spoken to me.

Blood soaked the sheets beneath me, spreading rapidly until half the blanket was stained crimson. I nearly died from blood loss, saved only by a good Samaritan who came to my rescue.

I had finally awakened from my fantasy, and this time, I was ready to walk away for good.

""Put your trust in me one last time, Austin,"" I whispered urgently. ""We have to find a way to make him reject me and get ourselves out of this nightmare.""

I had known for years that my mate never loved me.

That evening, I returned to the villa to find Brown arranging fresh flowers in the living room. White lilies and baby's breath in an elaborate bouquet.

He had never cared about flowers before. During our first anniversary, when I had filled our home with roses, he complained about the pollen making him sneeze and threw them all away.

But when Mia mentioned she loved floral arrangements, he suddenly developed a passion for floriculture.

Tonight, he stepped back to admire his handiwork. ""You're late. Did the pack council meeting drag on through another moon phase?""

Even in casual clothes, Brown's presence filled the room with an effortless elegance that had once made my heart flutter.

I kept my expression carefully neutral. ""The alliance negotiations with the Northern packs required more time than expected.""

He nodded absently. Work was always my excuse, and he never questioned it.

""Why don't you go shower and come down for our anniversary dinner? I've asked the omegas to prepare your favorite dishes.""

As I headed toward my chamber, my eyes caught sight of our mating ceremony photograph. It was now shattered on the floor.

""Oh, I forgot to mention,"" Brown said casually, ""Mia arrived earlier and insisted on spending time with us since it's our anniversary week. She'll be staying with us for now. She accidentally broke the photograph while the omegas were moving your things to the omega quarters.""

My blood chilled. ""Moving my things?""

""You know she's timid and can't sleep alone at night, so I told her to take your chambers."" His tone was matter-of-fact, as if displacing his own wife was perfectly reasonable.

A dull ache stirred in my chest as my wolf, Jayla, growled inside my head, demanding I let her rip him apart. But I pushed the rage back. I couldn't afford to ruin everything now.

""Sis, you're back!"" Mia's voice echoed sweetly as she emerged from what used to be my room.

Brown moved quickly to cover the fresh hickeys on Mia's shoulder, but I still caught a glimpse of them. His abrupt movement shoved me hard, and I fell backward into the broken photograph frame. Glass shards pierced my skin, drawing a sharp hiss of pain.

Brown didn't even notice my cry as he pushed Mia back inside, grabbing the door handle and locking it behind them.

Watching him shut me out, I let out a bitter laugh.

I wasn't even bothered by their fairytale romance anymore. All I wanted was to find a way to make Brown reject me and reclaim my pack.

If it were an outsider, I would have fought for my marriage long ago. But since my foster sister was the one destroying it, I refused to battle her over a man who had never chosen me. Not even once.

When my father was still alive, he always said I would marry into the Raymond family, as foreseen and sealed by the Moon Goddess. After he died, I was adopted by my foster parents who happened to be Brown's omegas and Mia's parents.

Brown Raymond and Mia had been childhood sweethearts. Just before their planned mating, I entered their lives, unaware of their relationship.

But out of greed for my inheritance, my foster parents devised an alliance with Brown to make me fall for him and become his Luna, so they could seize control of my pack through him.

""Two people can't be alpha of one territory,"" my adoptive mother had whispered in Brown's ear. ""I advise you marry her and subdue her powers.""

Their plan worked flawlessly. They were promoted to Betas, and he promised to make Mia his Luna eventually.

When he proposed to me, I was overjoyed, believing I was fulfilling my father's dying wish.

Unfortunately, I discovered their betrayal too late. After I had lost everything and everyone in my pack who once looked to me as their Alpha now despised me because of how Brown treated and demoted them all.

All those years of supposed love had been nothing but pretense to steal my inheritance. Marrying me was simply the fastest way to claim everything my bloodline held. Love was never part of their plan.

As these bitter thoughts intensified, a spark of realization flickered across my face. I pulled out my phone and rushed to the balcony to make a call.

""I think I've found the perfect way to make Alpha Brown reject me,"" I said, unable to hide the hope in my voice.



CHAPTER TWO

""Luna,"" Austin's voice came sharp and low through the phone. ""What plan is that? Remember, if we're caught with whatever scheme you're devising, we're doomed forever.""

""There's absolutely nothing to worry about. Just trust me. All I need right now is your cooperation.""

Austin Hudson. My father's former Beta, whom Brown had demoted to Omega the moment he promoted Mia's parents to Beta positions.

""The plan is for you to leave visible hickeys on me. That would drive Brown insane and force him to reject me. Don't you think it would work?""

""Luna, if anyone stands to lose from this plan, it would be you,"" Austin warned gravely. ""Remember, Alphas can manipulate their way out of scandals, but their Lunas cannot. You would indeed be rejected, but cast out with nothing like an outcast. He'll surely reject you, but you might never get another chance to rule us again.""

I dropped the phone from my ear at his words, clutching the balcony rail as doubt crept in. Suddenly, laughter erupted from my former room as the door opened slightly.

I turned to find Mia holding my husband's arm tightly, smiling at me with false sweetness.

""Browny, I think Olivia is still angry with me for breaking the photograph and taking her room. Maybe I should just leave tonight. I don't want her feeling uncomfortable on her anniversary,"" Mia said with practiced innocence.

Brown dotingly tapped her nose and replied gently, ""You worry too much, Mia. She can't still be angry over such trivial things. Am I right, Olivia?""

""It's just a photograph anyway. You don't need to disturb yourself. You might be the one in the next one,"" I replied coldly.

Brown didn't pursue the conversation further. It might have looked petty.

At our anniversary dinner table, I stared at the dishes prepared by the omegas. Every single item was Mia's favorite. Not one was meant for me. Most I was allergic to, and the rest I despised, which Brown knew perfectly well.

It felt as though I was merely a guest at my own anniversary celebration while Mia, my sister, was the one being honored.

Now it made sense why Brown would request mushroom soup whenever he left for long meetings, despite hating mushrooms himself.

I looked up at my husband, who was completely focused on Mia, giggling like a schoolboy. This man I had been married to for four years apparently didn't know I couldn't eat any of the food on the table.

The meal was half-finished before Brown noticed my empty plate.

""These are your favorites. Why aren't you eating?"" he asked with feigned concern.

I stared at the plates before me. Seafood pasta in cream sauce, mushroom soup. My throat began to constrict just looking at them.

I raised my eyebrows at my supposed mate. ""I'm allerg...""

Mia smoothly stole the remaining words from my mouth, throwing a pitiful look my way. ""I don't know if this is the right time to ask, but I've already discussed this with Alpha Brown,"" she said, rubbing his palm gently.

Mia expertly redirected his attention to herself, and his concern about why I hadn't eaten vanished instantly.

My anxiety spiked as I waited to hear what this was about.

Brown then informed me, ""My uncle, the Alpha King, is holding a council meeting among the Alphas of the Northern region.""

""You and Mia will be accompanying me. Unfortunately, Mia's luggage was lost at the airport. Everything she brought for the meeting is gone.""

I shifted uncomfortably in my seat, feeling as though I were sitting on fire. So this was the real reason he had brought Mia back. Not for our anniversary, but for this important meeting.

Who would have thought I'd been believing his lies until now?

I had been aware of this meeting all along and had even prepared for it, while I was deliberately kept in the dark about Mia's involvement.

With mucus forming in my throat, I asked, ""When is this meeting?""

""Tonight at nightfall. You have enough time to make arrangements. As I mentioned, she lost everything at the airport. She's the same size as you, and the family's traditional Luna dress is the only piece that would work right now. Let her wear it for the meeting.""

""I even had to persuade her to wear it, considering she doesn't usually share belongings with others. You've only worn the Luna dress once, so she should take it.""

I immediately shot Brown a look of mixed surprise and disappointment.



CHAPTER THREE

Not only had I been uninformed about the meeting she was attending, but now she wanted my Luna dress as well.

That dress was a sacred family tradition, worn only by the Luna of the pack. Knowing this, Brown still wanted her to wear it.

""You can have it,"" I said lightly, though my heart was breaking. ""I'll have the omegas prepare the dress for you.""

Besides, I had no intention of putting it on my body ever again.

""You don't need to do that. I already did,"" Brown announced, his words piercing my heart like a blade.

He had no right to do that. Since I headed the female omegas, they only took such significant orders from me. The dress could only be released with the Luna's approval.

""Thanks, Olivia,"" Mia cut in sweetly. ""I knew my stay here would be memorable because of you.""

I didn't utter another word as I stood to leave the table, but Mia stopped me.

""You don't mind taking some pictures of us, right? Since it's your anniversary, I want to preserve this memory,"" she said, extending her phone toward me.

Memory, indeed.

Mia hurriedly moved closer to Brown and clung to him like a parasite. In the past, when Brown and I went on dates, Mia was always the one taking pictures for us. Now the roles were reversed.

I took several photographs in various poses of my mate with his lover until they were finally satisfied and left the table, smiling at each other.

After watching their retreating figures, I turned to leave but accidentally knocked over a small ceramic coffee kettle on the table.

The kettle wobbled precariously, then toppled over completely. Scalding liquid cascaded down, splashing across my bare feet and ankles. I inhaled sharply, stumbling backward as I steadied myself against the table's edge. The burning sensation spread across my skin like wildfire.

Hot coffee seeped between my toes and pooled on the floor around me, but Brown had already turned away, his attention captured by Mia as they smiled and chattered over their photographs. They disappeared around the corner, leaving me alone with my agony.

How different things would be if this had happened to Mia. Brown would have swept her up immediately, called for ice, fussed over every possible burn mark. He would have insisted on a doctor and the finest care money could buy.

But I remembered a time when I would have received such care. When my father ruled as Alpha, omegas rushed to tend to my every need. A single scratch would have summoned healers and worried attendants. Everything changed the day my parents died. Now, despite my mating to Brown, I remained invisible. I had been forgotten for far too long.

I quietly left the dining area and returned to the omega quarters where I now belonged.

The afternoon stretched endlessly as I tended to my wounds, unsure if I even wanted to attend the meeting. I vowed to myself that I would find a way to break free from Brown and reclaim my pack as soon as possible.

An omega interrupted my brooding thoughts, touching my shoulder gently.

""Luna, I have something important to tell you. Alpha Brown ordered us to prepare the family's traditional Luna dress for your sister. Are you just going to sit there and watch her wear it?""

""It's fine, Julia. It's just a dress. She can wear it...""

Julia cut me off, her surprise evident. ""No, Luna, it's not just a dress! Can't you see what they're planning? This council meeting held by the Alpha King is strictly attended by the five allied Alphas of the Northern region and their Lunas, where the Lunas are supposed to formally greet the Alpha King.""

""It's a tremendous honor to meet with him because nobody except his family knows what he looks like. Rumors say he's the most powerful wolf alive, and no one dares challenge him.""

""From my perspective, this can only mean one thing: Alpha Brown is positioning Mia as his Luna, and he's trying to get the other Alphas to recognize her as well. At this point, Luna, if nothing is done, you'll be no different from us omegas.""

Julia stared at me desperately before tears pooled in her eyes and streamed down her cheeks uncontrollably.

I stood before the mirror, staring at my reflection as tears dropped onto the tiles below.

""I have to meet this Alpha King myself, but how?"" I thought desperately.

There was only one way out of this nightmare I had created by trusting Brown. I had to give him a taste of his own medicine.

I pulled out my phone and sent a message to Austin: ""Make arrangements for an expensive and breathtaking dress for me.""

The time had come to remind everyone exactly who I was.



CHAPTER FOUR

Nightfall descended upon the council hall as the meeting concluded far sooner than Olivia had anticipated. Having spent the entire day organizing the proceedings without stopping to eat, her stomach growled with fierce hunger. Desperate for sustenance, she forced herself to gulp down the shellfish soup that had been prepared for the guests.

Almost immediately, unease crept through her body as hives began spreading across her skin. Frantically searching her handbag, she thankfully found some antihistamines. Olivia rushed toward the nearest refuge, an empty storage room stocked with bottles of water, and grabbed one. But just as she was about to open the bottle, the sharp clang of the closing metallic door startled her. She stumbled, and both the water and tablet tumbled from her grasp, the medication dissolving completely on the floor.

""You really have the nerve to show up tonight,"" came a cold voice from behind her. ""I specifically took that dress from you to ensure you'd stay home, yet you still had the audacity to find something else to wear just to steal my spotlight.""

""First it was my man, now my rightful position. You have no shame, do you?""

Doubling over as the itching intensified, Olivia began scratching frantically at her inflamed skin while fever gradually overtook her weakened body. Her voice emerged weak but defiant: ""Mia, please, it's you Brown cherishes now. I'm nothing to him.""

Mia released a cold, bitter laugh. ""I'm not buying a word from you, you pathetic fool. Unlike you, I know when to retreat from loving a man who couldn't care less about me.""

""By tomorrow morning, the headlines will read 'Olivia the Thief.' You'd better prepare yourself for the consequences, because from what I know, the Alpha King would never spare an intruder on his property.""

""Please, Mia, don't lock me in here! Help... somebody help me!""

With a twisted smile, Mia hurried to the back door and informed one of the guards that she'd spotted an intruder entering the storage house.

The relentless itching prevented Olivia from calling for help as her body turned red and bumps formed from her desperate scratching.

When it was finally time for everyone to leave, Brown noticed Olivia's empty seat and grew concerned. Mia blinked at him with feigned innocence. ""Browny, do you think she got upset because I wore her Luna dress? I would have chosen something else if I'd known.""

Hearing this, Brown frowned. ""Don't worry about that. I should have made you my Luna long ago anyway. You're so much better; you know when to give me space and never make me feel annoyed. Let's go home. I need to settle this once and for all."" He interlaced his fingers with hers, and they departed together.

That night, Olivia remained locked in the prison cell until morning, deliriously mumbling about seeing the Alpha King. He hadn't attended the meeting. It was his Beta and the council elders who had presided, as the Alpha King had left to resolve an urgent matter.

The next morning at the prison, Olivia was barely recognizable due to the swollen bumps covering her face. The chief guard interrogated her about her identity.

""I'm Alpha Brown's Luna,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible.

The chief guard immediately alerted Elias, the Alpha King's Beta, who called Brown to explain the situation. As Brown's voice echoed through the phone, tears pooled in Olivia's eyes.

""I'm not married, and even if I were, it certainly wouldn't be to a lunatic,"" he said coolly before ending the call without hesitation.

He did this to avoid being associated with the theft allegations and to maintain favor with his uncle, harboring irrational fear of someone only a few years his senior.

""I reject you too, Brown,"" Olivia sobbed through her delirium.

Enraged by what he deemed a despicable lie, Beta Elias ordered them to confine her without food or water.

After days of dry fasting, her ears became blocked, her vision blurred, and her legs grew unsteady. She collapsed from exhaustion and high fever.

When she finally opened her eyes, a gray ceiling met her bewildered gaze.

""What happened to me?"" she whispered as fragmented memories flashed before her. Suddenly, a dominating aura enveloped the entire room, making her wolf Jayla whimper. The dark energy radiating from the newcomer turned everything gloomy and cold.

Through the stench of her own blood, her nose detected his alluring, masculine scent. Olivia's mouth watered as she tried to whisper the word her wolf was screaming in her head:

""Mate!""

I have found my mate...



CHAPTER FIVE

Her wolf Jayla's tail wagged enthusiastically, cooing inside her head. Olivia had thought her wolf had fallen into a deep slumber, but seeing her fated mate revived Jayla's broken heart, bringing her back to life.

""How long have I been here?"" Olivia asked the man who continued staring at her without blinking.

""Four days,"" he said raspily. ""I'm truly sorry for how my guards treated you. They will be severely punished for their actions.""

""No, it's fine. They acted that way because they weren't certain of my intentions.""

His voice was as alluring as his presence. Half his face remained hidden in shadows, yet he was undeniably good-looking.

Recognizing him as her only escape from Brown, Olivia decided not to waste this opportunity. Four days had passed without even a word from Brown.

Tears filled her eyes as she locked her gaze at Lucianus. He gently pulled her upright, allowing the tears to flow freely down her cheeks.

""Why are you crying?"" he asked, tucking her hair behind her ear. ""I can't bear to wait patiently all these years only to find you in such distress.""

Upon hearing this, Olivia raised her eyes to meet his, tears of joy streaming uncontrollably. She had thought her father was mistaken about what he'd said over the years, but looking at this man sitting beside her now, every wound in her heart began to heal.

They were interrupted when a woman in her early fifties entered with a feast, and to Olivia's surprise, every dish was among her favorites.

""How did you know I like all of these?"" Olivia asked in amazement, savoring every aroma.

""Your body was in terrible condition when I returned, and the healer said it was due to allergies. I had my men research everything about you, and the least they could gather was from your social media posts.""

After three hours with the Alpha King, Olivia requested her handbag before leaving. Checking her phone, she discovered there were no missed calls or even a text from Brown.

""Let my guards escort you,"" Lucianus declared.

""I still have matters to settle, and I don't wish to raise any suspicions about us.""

Immediately after she finished speaking, Lucianus opened his palm to reveal a large, visible scar.

He explained that he had always felt pain in his palm over the years, and when he sought answers, he was told his mate was suffering. The pain had been so intense during his week-long trip that he'd rushed home for treatment, but it had faded the moment he laid eyes on her, leaving only the permanent scar.

""I have found you, mate, and I won't let my palm bleed anymore. I'm giving you one week to finish whatever you need to do before you return to me. I will discipline my nephew myself.""

Olivia nodded eagerly as he pressed a kiss to her forehead, and then she departed.

As soon as Olivia entered the omega quarters, she saw Mia burning items in front of the building. Mia flashed her a look accompanied by a smirk.

Olivia ignored her and went inside to pack her belongings. To her shock, the room was empty except for her parents' keepsake, which lay broken on the floor.

Olivia dropped to her knees in tears, desperately trying to piece it back together. It was the only remaining memento of her parents. No pictures, no jewelry, just this.

As she struggled to repair the keepsake, Mia's voice interrupted her efforts.

""You made it back alive. I thought the Alpha King would have used you as dinner.""

Olivia ignored her, continuing to sob uncontrollably.

""Well, I thought you wouldn't be returning, and my puppy needed a place to stay. So I was instructed to remove every trace of you so my puppy wouldn't have difficulty settling in. Sorry, but that's how much Browny loves me. He's a man who proves his love through actions.""

Olivia, who had been suppressing her anger, finally spoke up: ""How does that make you feel? Because as far as I'm concerned, you're using a hand me down from me. I think you shouldn't push me too far, because if you do, you'll leave me no choice but to tell the whole pack how evil your parents are, and how you've been frolicking with my mate.""

""He loves me and will soon make me his Luna,"" Mia declared, beating her chest in assurance. ""You might be his Luna now, but I own his heart. Aren't you even curious why he denied you and left you to die?"" Her tone turned syrupy and cruel. ""Because we went out of town to get me a puppy. So you see, you're nothing compared to me.""

The realization that Brown had humiliated her and left her to die over a puppy hit Olivia like a physical blow.

Unable to endure any more, Olivia moved to leave, but Mia immediately pulled out pepper spray and doused her face with it.

Having just recovered from a severe allergic reaction, Olivia found it impossible to breathe as she collapsed to the ground.

Through her haze, she heard Brown's voice as Mia dramatically dropped to the floor, leaving the spray canister beside Olivia's body.

At that moment, the door burst open. ""What's happening here?"" Brown demanded.",1,1754417683.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
