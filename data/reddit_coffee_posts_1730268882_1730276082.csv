1gfhh3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/1gfhh3e/still_hpv_positive_after_initial_diagnosis/,Still HPV positive after initial diagnosis,"I’m beyond devastated. Please help me with some words of encouragement.

This is my story: I became sexually active in late 2020. In January 2022 I did my first PAP, it was all clean. In March this year I got my PAP smear back which stated that I have HPV, I did the test at a private lab and it turned out that I have type 51, 53, 56 and 72. I’m 25f and I want to have children in a few years, so the doc after a colposcopy recommended to do a laser CO2 vaporization of the cervix in April this year. He said he recommends this procedure because Im still young and I have 4 high risk virsues so it’s best to attack now so it wouldn’t develop into something later. The op went well, I had almost no discomfort afterwards, the doc said he cleared everything (even in the cervical canal)and also my other gynecologist said that from the outside it looks like a very well job done was done. 6 months later I was scheduled for another PAP and HPV test. In the meanwhile I made some lifestyle changes, started taking lots of supplements etc. And now, the results from my HPV test came back positive for type 51, 53, 72 and 82??? I’m due to retake the test at a private lab, and Im still waiting for the PAP results (although I might do one in the private clinic as well). I also want to retake the test so I can see the viral load because with the public test doesn’t measure it. After the results I should go for another colposcopy. But so far I’ve been feeling very anxious and defeated. What can I do more?? In the following 6 months I will do an extreme diet and cut out everything (sugar, alcohol and coffee completely) and also be disciplined with all the supplements . But Im worried that it still didn’t clear up after the procedure. I was taking AHCC, beta glucan, inosine pranobex, vitamin C and zinc mainly. ",1,1730275690.0,HPV,0,1.0,False

Ever wondered what happens when you combine a coffee-fueled developer, a passion for AI, and a mission to make it accessible to everyone? Well, you're looking at it! 👋

I'm Sahil, and I started Synthiq because I saw something wrong in the AI world: while big companies were living in the future, small businesses were being left behind. Not anymore.

What are we cooking up? 🤖

* AI Voice Agents that sound so natural, they'll make you do a double-take
* Chatbots that actually... you know... chat (and help!)
* Automation that doesn't require a PhD to set up

Right now, we're helping real businesses do some pretty cool stuff:

* A medical billing company using our AI to handle 100+ patient calls daily
* Real estate agents closing deals while they sleep
* Restaurants booking tables without lifting a finger

Here's the fun part: Instead of building behind closed doors, we're inviting you backstage. You'll see our wins, our facepalm moments, and everything in between.

Why? Because the future of AI shouldn't be a secret sauce – it should be a potluck where everyone brings something to the table! 🍜

1gfhacc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gfhacc/update_aitah_for_refusing_to_take_parental/,(Update) AITAH for refusing to take Parental Responsibility for my Siblings?,"Hey everyone, wow I didn’t expect to get so many replies and comments on my last post, I can’t say how much it means and how helpful it has been for me, so thank you all dearly! 

I’ve had a bit of time to vent and calm myself down after everything, so thought I’d come back to elaborate on a few points I’ve been asked about, mainly asking other family for assistance and about the fathers of my siblings, here’s what I know:

First of all, the number of family members I have been able to reach that could actually assist is small - Two uncles and three cousins from said uncles. Speaking to my uncles, they had interesting reactions to say the least… 

My mother never has been a saint, and she has had trouble with her past which I have respected and tried to never hold against her (She had a SA case when me and the second eldest sibling were young, and had issues with gambling to cope with the problem - She has since seen someone to help with the gambling, but she’s never gotten over the SA)

With that gambling issue, my mother was caring for my Nan at the time (She was her carer like I am for my mother’s at the moment) and used her money to gamble, which the uncles caught wind of and went mental… She was removed from being my Nan’s carer, and me, my mother and one sister at the time, was forced to move into a refuge or go homeless - They’ve never really involved themselves ever since and always gone out of their way to belittle or hold the mistake over her head, more or less making my mother cut them off after getting nothing but abuse despite trying to prove she’s changed and fixed herself.

I spoke to them and begged for help, trying to make the point that my mother’s mistake shouldn’t translate to my younger siblings, and while we live a few hours from them, I’d be willing to see if there’s anywhere closer I could move to help if they’d be willing to take them on, of which I got nothing but a flat no, as well as being told that the kids are going to be better off in the care system.

As for my cousins? Two already have children and can’t make room for more and the third I couldn’t reach at all, despite several attempts… I did think to ask my Nan, but after consideration, I can’t ask that of her, with her having health issues and constantly being taken to hospital, being forced to use oxygen daily, etc.

As for the fathers? My father has already taken responsibility of myself, the second and the third in terms of finances, but refuses to move in and take parental responsibility for them, stating he can’t leave his job, (He lives 5 hours away with his sister) The second father can’t help as he was the person who caused the SA case with my mother and as such, is not allowed any contact and hasn’t tried to make contact since the incident.

With being separated from all the family, (my mother moved me and the siblings several hours away when younger) it’s especially tougher to even go somewhere locally to get help, we’re all we got. I have been told to refuse helping my mother by everyone I’ve spoken to, that she’s a manipulator and that she’s getting what’s coming to her, but when I see my youngest sister pulling on my leg, trying to hold on tight and screaming when she’s having to let me go for the day, I can’t help but feel guilt and the urge to cry all over again

Ugh, I can feel myself getting ready to cry again, so I’ll stop the ranting and save everyone’s eyes! I’ll update when I get the chance next. Probably after a coffee… Or three.

For clarity, I LOVE MY PARTNER. 
She is the best thing that’s ever happened to me and after the abusive, terrible relationship I was in previously, she is a ray of sunshine. We have our days but we have never gone to bed angry and we have never broken up or taken break. 
We have been living together for over a year now and things are really great. I’m the cook so she does all the dishes. She makes me coffee every morning and always packs my lunch. I am very well taken care of. I pay most of the bills in the house and always take her on dates as a thank you for being the girlfriend ever. We are like best friends to be honest. Always having late night giggle sessions and I feel myself around her. She’s my whole life I couldn’t imagine being with anyone else… but this may be the issue I’m having. 
Recently I’ve been really depressed. Fighting my mental health issues and going through a really bad slump. At first I thought it was her. That I didn’t care if we were together or not… but then I realised I didn’t care if I was involved with anyone. I just want to be alone. I love being around friends but only for like an hour max, then I’m ready to just sit alone, play my games and be in complete silence. When my girlfriend goes out alone or visits her friends I literally feel amazing. All alone in our house, doing nothing. I’m never upset when she gets home but something feels wrong. Even getting home from work… I sometimes stay at my office an extra hour just for the peace and quiet. 
She’s quite a talkative person so when I get home I get a lot of questions and she wants to engage in conversation and all I can think about is doom scrolling for a couple of hours, cooking a meal and going straight to bed. 
I hate that I feel this way because I love her and I want to be with her for the rest of my life but I also just want to be alone… am I a bad person or is there something psychologically wrong with me?

I don't understand why highest F/C isn't B

'volunteer' means it's for free. And that implies that the denominator would be 0, implying F is infinity.

Alternatively, am i expected to put a price to the upper management's time? 

for example, i guess i could  estimate that their salary is say, 1M per year, therefore 1M/12 per month / 20 for 20 working days a month = 4,160 per day, and then 4160/8 = 500 per hour. 

so B would be 1/500 vs A 30/5 ?

Even my family hates me. I figure working somewhere where I have to talk to people would help.

I've been at my store for over 6 years, I'm the most senior barista in the store, even more so than my current manager. This entire time I get excluded by generations and generations of baristas. My coworkers over 6 years make group among themselves and meet up. I've never met up with anyone. And in 6 years there had been over 100 people that had ever worked in my store. When coworkers talk to me they talk to me like I'm a customer, like they don't actually want or enjoy talking to me, but they just have to. You can tell by the tones of their voice talking to me vs literally anyone else. I've never won partner of the quarter either. Meanwhile this one girl got it after working for 8 months.

I've been there for a long time, plenty of customers know me and recognize me. But they only treat me as a dispenser that knows their usual drinks. They never make any small talks with me, no one has even given me any gifts, no one is curious about my life. Only I hear my name or any recognition is ""that guy knows my drink"". Meanwhile there's this Japanese girl that started 2 month ago, and customer's been crazy over her, asking her about her life in Canada, her language, how her school is. And routinely got food or gifts. Same goes for most other coworkers I know, they at least have a couple customers that they small talk with.

Yesterday, while walking back home along the same way as every other day, one lady stopped me. I knew exactly what she was and what she wanted, but I have too much social anxiety to say no immediately. She seemed really excited, so it's hard to say no. She asked me questions, like which country I'm from, where do I live, where do I work, how long have I been here etc. I answered her questions, without giving too much detail.

I've been here for, like, 5 years now, but my Korean is still very weak. I couldn't understand most of what she was asking, and couldn't answer most questions she asked coz I couldn't understand her. After, like, 5 minutes, she got a call from someone, and I heard her (excitedly) telling her about me. She then handed me the phone, and a girl spoke to me in perfect English. She told me she wants to get to know me, and she'd love to meet and talk. I asked her point blank what this is about, and she said she wants to talk about God.

I'm born Catholic, not the culty Catholic, but my mom is very religious. So I have a complicated relationship with religion. I'm openly atheist (except with my family), and kinda hate gods and religious people (I guess it's not that complicated). But I am interested in cults and religious people, and have joined at least two in the last two years. Also, my weekend was open, so I gave her my number, and she said she'll text me.

After this, I handed back her phone, but she wouldn't let up. She said let's have dinner together. I wasn't really feeling it, so I just pretended not to understand. After some miming and pleading, she dragged me into a convenience store, and bought me three Banana milk (2+1). I insisted she keep two, but she wouldn't let up, and we parted ways. There was a brief two minutes I thought she might follow me home, but I was just being paranoid.

Today, I get a text from the English-speaker, and we fixed a meeting for this Sunday. We'll meet for coffee and talk about god (bring it on). As I said before, I've joined two cults before, so I know they're basically harmless. In fact, in my last cult (an year and half back), I would meet with the pastor once or twice a month, and we would straight up debate the existence of God and purpose of religion, and this was really fun for me. I'm hoping this lady will also lead me to some pastor like him.

I'm confident that I will not be a victim, I've got a solid support system of friends who understand my quirks and my affinity for cults, and I'm sure they'll pull me out if I end up in a mess. But this time, I'm gonna keep y'all posted, so you can share in the fun.

Sunday I sat down in a chair to grab my ipad off the coffee table, stood up and immediately felt pain shoot down my leg. It didn't subside. I went back to resting for a few days again. Went for a short walk yesterday (just around the block) and it was sore, and I feel like my leg hurts more again.

I was really looking forward to my first Gardelli order, as I'm just about to venture into the ""international top segment"" of roasters. I am now all the more disillusioned and perplexed about the bean.
At first glance, the bean does not make a particularly good impression - there are clear signs of burning, scorching and tipping. In terms of taste, I also search in vain for the indicated plum. Too bad, a little more acidity would have done the somewhat boring and for me rather indefinable aromas good. There is still a lot of sweetness without that certain something. Certainly not a bad coffee, but nowhere near the level I had expected and hoped for...

The dynamics of coffee pricing are influenced by various factors, including supply and demand fluctuations, climate conditions, geopolitical events, currency exchange rates, and market speculation. Understanding these factors is essential for those involved in coffee production and trade, as even slight price changes can have a significant impact on the livelihoods of millions, especially in developing nations heavily dependent on coffee exports.

A primary factor affecting coffee prices is weather. Coffee crops are particularly sensitive to climate changes, especially in key producing regions like Brazil, Colombia, and Vietnam, which produce a majority of the world’s coffee. Droughts, frosts, and excessive rains can drastically impact harvest yields, leading to shortages and price hikes. For instance, recent adverse weather events in Brazil, the largest coffee producer, have led to substantial yield reductions, subsequently raising global coffee prices. The sensitivity of coffee crops to these unpredictable conditions adds an element of volatility to the market, where even seasonal weather forecasts can send prices swinging.

Taking cyanocobalamin 1mg x1 per day in AM and ferrous sulphate 200mg x1 per day. Along with a multivitamin, vitamin D3 and omega 3,6 & 9. 

Is there anything else I should be doing to help such as taking other supplements, going to bed earlier/waking up later or resting more than I'm 'doing' for example housework, hobbies, socialising etc. Would it be better to take ferrous sulphate in the AM as I'm currently taking it in the afternoon?

I'm F 33 based in UK. My recent test results are:

Serum B12: 177 ng/L
Serum ferritin: 26.9 microg/L
Serum Folate: 7.1 microg/L
Haemoglobin: 130 g/L
Serum iron level: 10.9 micromol/L

Lifestyle factors:

- Vegan diet (since 2018, fairly healthy/varied but there's room for improvement)

- Smoker (since early teens, no more than 20 a day)

- Little to no exercise (only walking to/from work on weekdays - work in an office so sat down most of the day)

- Terrible for staying hydrated (mainly drink tea/coffee)

I've read through the guide but there was so much information I'm struggling to process and understand it all.

Symptoms I can relate to for B12/iron/folate deficiency that I've read in the guide:

• ADHD-like symptoms (especially with executive function such as prioritising tasks, memory and staying focused/easily distracted - earlier in the year I thought I may have ADHD, now I'm thinking the symptoms I experience are more likely linked to B12 deficiency as I've not struggled in the past with the above as intensely as I have recently)

• Anxiety 

• Brain fog

• Chest pain 

• Fatigue 

• Heart palpitations 

• Insomnia 

• Altered menstrual cycle

• No libido

• Muscle spasms and twitches 

• Muscle soreness

• Nail changes (little to no half moons, vertical ridges, a few nails have beau's lines)

• Paresthesia (most noticeable in my legs but also sometimes in my arms and fingers)

• Shortness of breath (when doing simple movement, this may also be caused by bring a long term smoker)

• Dizziness (can happen when I'm stood up or just sat down, sometimes it also happens when I yawn it's such a weird sensation and the only way I can explain it is that my whole body feels 'fuzzy' I had a bad experience this morning after I got up where I felt so dizzy/unsteady that I almost fell backwards)

• General weakness (I feel like I used to be quite strong considering I'm quite a slim build, but now I feel so weak and sometimes just holding up my phone or toothbrush makes my arm muscles feel weak and fatigued)

It's possible there are more, I'm just not sure what some of the names of things listed mean, so will investigate those further.

I feel quite a range of emotions right now - angry, frustrated, upset and disappointed. In previous years I'd felt symptoms I've mentioned and I was diagnosed with depression, now I wonder if I was actually deficient in something (likely iron as this was way lower than I am now back in 2015 but I fell within the markers of a normal range at the time). At the start of this year I was prescribed ferrous fumarate due to low iron but the GP never advised me to come back for a follow up blood test - something I've now been advised to do following the 3 month course I'm currently on. I feel sad because I'm struggling to get through each day of just normal daily life, I don't feel like I'm living I'm just existing and this is very much how I've spent majority of this year. I'm a shadow of the person I feel I used to be and it's so depressing.
I just hope that in time I'll be able to bring back the person I used to be. 

If you've read this far down, thank you, I really appreciate it and if you're able to offer any advice, support or tips I would greatly appreciate that too.

I want to start to say that I know the thing to do is probably scrape it, but just in case...

I was rendering fat from a whole duck yesterday on the stovetop. It was going beautifully. I was also roasting the carcass because I wanted to make bone broth afterwards.

In the carcass tray, I noticed some now liquified fat that I must have missed when I cleaned the bird. I went to add that fat to my pot of fat. Yes, some drippings also went in (which I didn't thing would be a big deal because gravy/it would boil off?). The pot erupted in smoke. NBD, I kept pouring in the extra fat. What I didn't notice while trying to keep smoke out of my eyes is that the pot had also moved on the induction burner, and incidentally turned the burner all the way up. My skin bits burnt quickly (which I didn't see because smoke) and went soggy. :(

Now, here's where I truly messed up. I grabbed a filter, and old overpour coffee filter, and added a paper coffee filter lining. I started to pour the fat to separate it from the burnt bits, it's color already darkened. However, stupidly, the coffee filter lining was made of plastic. This of course melted, but slowly enough that I did not noticed until most of the fat had been transfered. 

Most of the plastic stayed intact, warping the shape of the filter dramatically into a black blob. There were a few bits that I was able to pick out, though truth I am unsure if this was plastic or the charred remains of the skin.

Trying to salvage what I could, I opted to clarify the fat, putting it in a steal bowl and pouring boiling water over it. That was last night. This morning, the fat has not hardened. It's still dark and oily, sitting on top of the water, but even in the fridge for a few hours it isn't solid.

I know I should throw it out, BUT, can I do anything to save this? The dark color of the fat I think is more because I burnt it (which also ruin the flavor profile) not because of the plastic, but I don't know? Please help, I don't have time to render more fat for the dinner I'm hosting Saturday. Luckily the bone broth came out perfectly.

Lastly, can anyone help me understand the chemistry as to why the fat isn't solidifying? Or if it is trash, are there any other non-edible uses for duck fat? Thanks!",2,1730271479.0,AskCulinary,5,1.0,False

My skinny mother used to call me fat (even though I was not fat, just curvier than her), I had low self-esteem during all my teenage years and young adulthood, and thought I could never be considered attractive by anyone because I was 'fat' according to my mother.

I'm very impulsive, indisciplined, and find it hard to do the things the right way. Nothing is harder for me than getting good habits (I have bipolar disorder, btw). So, balanced meals and exercises (the most obvious and basic formula for losing weight) were habits I could never sustain for long, there was always, deep in my mind, the will to do ""bad stuff"".

Anyway, at that time, I looked for a lot of 'pro-ana' and 'pro-mia' content and groups online, it became an obsession...

Bulimia brought me a lot of stomach issues, like frequent heartburn due to hiatus hernia and I don't want to make them worse.

However, being super skinny is on fashion again and I've been feeling uncomfortable with my curvy body, just  like I felt 10 years ago. I'm not a person who is easily influenced by fashion tendencies, but the fact that skinny bodies are in again triggers me in a certain way...

I have been taking Ritalin lately (not sure if I have ADHD, but my psychiatrist thinks I might have it, and she prescripts it to me because it really helps me to improve concentration on my studies and work) and the fact it lessens my appetite also triggers me. From time to time, I have thoughts like: ""what if instead of having lunch, I just take coffee and Ritalin?""

These thoughts haven't been so frequent, until this week, when I caught myself thinking my thighs and butt are too big and that I should do something about it. As I said above, a balanced diet and physical activity don't work for me in a long term, I always end up giving them up.

One more time, I don't want to have bulimia again, I don't think about it anymore, but I've been feeling very tempted to skip meals and replace them with coffee and Ritalin.

I took Zoloft starting when I was 10 years old because I was having irrational phobias and anxiety related to my health. About a year and a half ago, I was taking 200 mg when I had the realization that 1) I was taking the maximum clinical dosage and the trajectory of my life was adding medication any time I encountered strife. 2) I didn’t want to be on medication forever. As a child with anxiety, you don’t get to play much of a role in your treatment plan and now that I am older, I would like to find other ways to heal myself. Over the past year and a half I slowly weaned off my dosage and for the past year I have been taking 25mg (I tried going off for a month or so but I felt such excruciating anxiety). I am currently taking a gap semester from university and I came to India where I have been staying in an ashram to learn about yoga/meditation etc. When I arrived to India a month ago, I stopped taking the last 25 mg of the medication and since then I’ve experienced many withdrawal symptoms from electric shocks to fatigue to aching pain in my back and inability to focus and heightened anxiety. Also I am quite agitated. This is really deflating for me because I prioritize my mental health a lot! I don’t eat overly stimulating foods, nor coffee, alcohol, no smoking, etc and as of 3 weeks ago, I started meditating every morning for 30 minutes and every evening for 30 minutes. Is there a light at the end of the tunnel? Am I naive for thinking that I can heal myself without medication?

Let’s Chat and Pretend to Be Productive!,"It’s that midweek, mid-afternoon slump, and I’ve hit the wall harder than a caffeine addict without coffee. Anyone else out there barely hanging on, watching the clock, and wondering if it’s socially acceptable to nap under the desk?

I (16) was kidnapped by my ex boyfriend (18). I’m going to call him Nathan. He had purchased me coffee and spiked it. I drank it not thinking too much and the rest is a blur. From what I was told, he offered me a “ride home” and in my drugged state i agreed. He instead took me to his house and raped me.

After 7 hours of nobody knowing where i was the police were called but he dropped me off at my house and the drug effects finally wore off by then but as a trauma response and the effects it was difficult for me to remember anything or who it was, but eventually he was arrested. 

But Nathan’s family is incredibly wealthy. The bail price was extremely high but they paid it to release him. And I’ve been fucking terrified ever since. I see him in my neighborhood nearly every day and i just don’t feel safe and can hardly function or be comfortable especially since he’s out.

What should i do..",2,1730269806.0,Advice,17,1.0,False

Tuwing pagkatapos ng klase ko ng tanghali, lunch lang saglit, tapos balik agad sa may gilid ng classroom namin kasi doon kami maglelesson naman for tutoring class. Noong lunch time, nakapuslit ako sa labas ng school at nakabili ako ng coffee flavored candy, stickers, jackstone tsaka  at kung ano pang mga anik anik sa labas ng school na kasya pa ang 20 pesos haha

Curious pa ako sa kung anong lasa nung candy, pagtikim ko totoo nga ang lasa ng kape kasi ang tapang ahahaha isa lang nakain ko that time pero maya maya shuta kumukulo tyan ko hahaha nanganganib na, edi ako naman si batang paslit di alam gagawin kasi taeng tae na nga 😆

edi naghanap ako ng pwedeng kakampi. may classmate ako sa tutor class din tapos kinausap ko sya, pinakita ko mga binili kong anik anik lalo na yung stickers at jackstone, sinabi ko sa kanya na ibibigay ko yun sa kanya pag sasamahan nya ako sa loob ng cr at sya magpaalam sa teacher namin 🤩

angas ng convincing powers ko! kasi napa-Oo ko sya! hahaha eh that time kapag 1 pm onwards na merong afternoon class sa classroom namin, ibang section na yun for grade 2. buti nalang nandun pa rin adviser namin ng umaga at nakapag paalam sya kung pwede mag cr saglit haha 💩

edi ayun, sinamahan nya ako mag poops sa cr, nakatalikod sya sa akin at tinakpan nya ang ilong nya kasi alam mo na WAHAHAHAHA after ko mag cr labas agad kaming dalawa na para bang walang nangyari 😂
 
kung nasaan ka man ngayon classmate, maraming salamat! sana successful ka sa buhay ngayon! ito ako ngayon, nagkakape sa tabi HAHAHAHA

Is there a coffee shop that is open late that you’d recommend? My favorite one of all time was full of couches and tables, had a full coffee AND liquor bar, a great big smoking deck with a fire when it was cold, and was open until 3am. Yeah, voices got a bit loud outside once we got beers in us, but inside had a lot of seating for just one or two people, or big couches for groups. Old sleepy bookstore vibes. Nothing fancy.

That’s why we’ve put together this guide to help you select the ideal **Cafe Desire coffee tea vending machine** for your needs, whether it’s for an office, hotel, or public space.

# Why Choose a Coffee and Tea Vending Machine?

 A coffee and tea vending machine provides easy access to fresh, hot beverages without the hassle of manual preparation. The convenience factor alone makes it a smart choice, but there are other benefits, such as:

When it comes to coffee and tea vending machines, Cafe Desire offers a variety of options to meet your specific needs. Here are the main types:

1gfg2ov,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1gfg2ov/escaping_family_drama_a_struggle_to_break_free/,Escaping family drama. A struggle to break free from a middle aged man who should be sleeping instead of posting to Reddit at 1:14 am. ,"I was going to start this like the Law & Order franchise opening: ""The following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event."" But then I thought, you know what? It’s not fictional; it’s fucking real. Cha-Ching, bitch!

It’s going to be a long read (I’ll make it as colorful as I can to keep your attention because, just like every other American, I also have the attention span of a pet rock). My main reason for posting this is to help someone before they throw away thirty years of their life and become a complete loser like I have. Besides my small six-month emergency account that I’m building (halfway there, folks), I know I’m about three paychecks away from growing an unkempt beard and living under a freeway off-ramp while passengers in cars, unfortunately trapped at the longest traffic light in this hemisphere, try awkwardly not to make eye contact with me. So yeah, I’m really not a glass-half-full kind of guy. And it’s OK I said that. You don’t have to DM me with the caring stuff or whatever it is Reddit does. I just want you to hear my story because I would like to help somebody and give back. It’s my form of charity, and the only charity I’m giving to is the Innocence Project—looking at you, Texas death row. So I guess this will be the second one. Don’t fret; things are getting better, but I know where I stand right now in life. So buckle up, throw on the cruise control, don’t text, and enjoy my story.

For years (oh, it’s been a lot of fucking years), I’ve been helping both my parents, who are now elderly, out emotionally, financially, and physically. Let’s start with Mom since I had an argument with her tonight, and she’s fresh on my mind. My mother has always made poor financial decisions throughout her life (I remember her cashing out a $2,000 401(k) when I was 15, and we all went on a spending spree at Walmart. Most kids get to go to Disneyland; I ended up in a shitty store known for union-breaking). Year after year, I’ve had to bail her out—whether by moving her to a more affordable place, paying her credit card bills, taking care of Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, and more, lending her money (got to keep Mom stocked in cigarettes), or buying food and clothing for my siblings (who have a strained relationship with me now and seem content with me helping our elderly parents. But that’s a different story for a different day). A few more tidbits: I took a week off work to help her get ready for her bankruptcy, which she decided not to move forward with at the end, and I watched as she let seven people move into a home she bought, who then helped themselves to her food, free electricity, free internet, and free rent while she chastised me. I also helped her deal with her idiot ex-husband, who kept resurfacing until he passed away. Seriously, the guy was like a cockroach; he just would not die. He would reappear for 17 years—think of James Woods in the movie Casino. The role could’ve been written for him. I’ve never won the lottery, but the day he passed away, I felt the same type of joy. I thought she was escaping only to learn she would replace him with another dirtbag. It was like she upgraded from Windows to Mac, except both came with viruses fully installed. Dealing with all of her craziness has, I finally realized (like someone in shock who finally puts it together years later), put my own life on hold.

Now let’s move on to dear old Dad. On the other hand, my father is just as bad, if not worse. First off, he is a hoarder. He keeps everything. I mean everything. Twice, I’ve cleaned out his shed only to find he restocked it with crap he found in a dumpster. I have broken laundry baskets, waterlogged wrapping paper, and a blender without a cord. Definitely something we should be paying storage on. We tried to have a garage sale once, but he wanted a king’s ransom for half his garbage. No, Dad, nobody wants one shoe with no laces for twenty dollars. I don’t know that many financially illiterate pirates, and neither do you. Over the years, I’ve bailed him out in different situations, lending him money for his child support payments (I was 16 and one of his children—funny how that works; I kind of paid myself), convincing him not to drive into a half-frozen river he was convinced he could cross with us when I was ten (it was early April, mind you), and offering him my home, which he wrecked by drilling holes in the walls to steal electricity, repainting the living room bile green because he found it on sale (yeah, Dad, that’s because nobody wants paint that resembles vomit), and occasionally stealing change from the communal washing machine (he’s always been a thief, and when I was younger, I was the lookout). To this day, I know how to crack into a vending machine. I now realize that I should have been focusing on my own needs all these years instead of tolerating his erratic behavior, which I suspect may stem from undiagnosed schizophrenia. His father had it, as did his father, and one of his elderly sisters spent her life and died in a state hospital. I feel bad about this, and I believe this is where I find myself championing any way I can help.

This ongoing situation with both parents (they are divorced) has cost me friends, relationships, my career, and my sanity. I used to be a writer (not saying I was great, but I did a decent job and was published a few times). I also performed on stage, went to concerts all the time, busked on the street, spent time with friends, traveled, and much more. I miss those times, and I mourn them like someone would mourn the passing of a pet. OK, that was melodramatic. Sorry about that. But it’s true, and I don’t have any help. My siblings are worthless, and it has always fallen on my shoulders to take care of both Mom and Dad.

This year, I reached a breaking point—not a mental breakdown, but a moment of clarity. I think it’s been a long time coming. Two years ago, I had a small episode where I became so angry I almost fainted because both of them were arguing with me at the same time over who I should borrow money from. It was like a reverse Price is Right episode, where instead of bidding on furniture, they were both trying to borrow more money than the other. I finally started pushing back against their demands this year, and it’s shocking how quickly they turned on me. Granted, they have treated me poorly in the past, but not to this degree. It’s like a whole new level of shittiness. See, you have regular shit, then you have manure, then you have liquid shit that can be sprayed everywhere. That’s what I’m experiencing right now—think of a fire hose, but instead of water, the entire city sewer system is being thrown at you verbally and emotionally. How’s that for painting a picture? I’ve always offered help to both when I believed it was needed, but now I realize I need to change the rules. They’ve always convinced me that it was necessary when it was not. Now, if one or both of them want my assistance, they must be willing to make changes as well. We have now started setting ground rules. Instead of throwing money into his savings account via bank transfer (only to find out he and Mom were going to restaurants and casinos), I now write checks to his landlord directly. Yeah, I know I shouldn’t be doing that, but it’s baby steps, so fuck off; don’t judge—I’m trying. I no longer agree to the same old patterns they seem stuck in. It’s now “once and done” with me. I listen to the request, I give a suggestion, and if it’s not up to their standards or if they want to change it, it’s fuck off; game over. And it feels amazing!

To take control of my life, I’ve set up an emergency savings account for myself and paid off most of my bills. I’m not the medical ones because we’re fucking doing that—you have to win Mega Millions for that! (I had to declare bankruptcy because of them at one point.) I’ve lost 35 pounds (which I gained due to depression from the situation), and I have started trying to find a therapist (honestly, this is one of the biggest hurdles because the last few I’ve seen seemed off and did not appear to be trying to help me. It could be me because I have a hard time trusting people). I only speak to both my parents now when I want to. I’ve also begun calling them both out on their behavior, whether privately or publicly. I kind of like doing it publicly because it’s fun. I just don’t want to end up on YouTube, so I keep it low-key but riddled with sarcasm. It doesn’t matter anymore; I am slowly freeing myself.

Am I going too far? Is this normal? Does it get easier? Do parents like this constantly relive their glory days and gripe about the past until they sound like a TikTok loop for the mentally deranged? These are questions I need answered. I love them both (honestly, I don’t know if that’s true anymore, but it makes me feel better, so I’m going to keep saying it at this point), but for the love of God and puppies, I just want to climb the tallest mountain and yell into the void, “Leave me the fuck alone! I’m in my 40s now.”

I’ve been dealing with this since I was eight years old, and I am so tired. Like, physically, emotionally, and mentally. It feels like coming back from a three-day music festival, but instead of great memories, you’re just wiped out because of anxiety and feelings of dread. At least you don’t have to pay $87 for a shitty T-shirt.

Here are a few more examples of what I grew up doing: using paper route money to cover rent (other kids were out buying video games while I was trying to cover a five-day quit-or-pay rent notice), cashing fast-food job checks to keep the lights on (it’s kind of hard to do schoolwork when it’s dark and you don’t know how to read in braille), and even dropping out of high school to care for a newborn sibling, which was a main chore of mine (don’t worry, I went back at 21, but those years were tough. Nothing brings you back to earth like filling out a job application and having to say no when asked if you have a high school diploma). I’ve also dealt with a gambling addiction myself (five years this New Year’s Eve, I should be clean), only to have one of my parents gift me $100 in scratch-off tickets for Christmas a few months after I announced I quit (his parents loved going to the casino with me. Why wouldn’t they? I paid for everything!). I’ve sacrificed so much, including my emotions, mental state, and even personal belongings (I’ve sold quite a few over the years to help financially). The best was when I actually had to sell a bed to help secure a down payment for a new home to rent after we faced eviction when I was 17. Nothing like moving into a new bedroom without a fucking bed. So where am I going to sleep? I think I’m going to snuggle up on this air vent.

If anybody has ever gone through something like this and wants to add any advice in the comments, feel free. I’m an open book at this point. Some questions I have are: How do you set boundaries with family, especially when they’ve relied on you for so long? How did your siblings react when you finally started pushing back? How can somebody enter witness protection? Is there an application process?

Like I said, I’m actually not angry at the world. I’m just fucking tired. I feel like Forrest Gump at the very end of that movie where he’s just like, “I’m done,” and starts walking back slowly from Monument Valley. No, that guy achieved a lot more than I ever have in my fucking life. Shit, he even mastered ping-pong while I’m lucky if I can figure out how to use Excel.

What an ending! Seriously, if you see signs of this happening to you and you are in your early 20s, get the fuck out. Do it for yourself and do it for your sanity. I don’t want to read about people on their deathbed always regretting things they never did in their life. I’ve probably got about another 25 to 30 years left, but I guarantee you I’m going to make it count. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to get some sleep so I can get up, make a coffee, and go to my dead-end job, pretending it’s adding any substance to my life while smiling like a deranged hyena at coworkers who probably feel the same but won’t admit it.
