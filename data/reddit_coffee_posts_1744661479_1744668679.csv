1jzbgwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1jzbgwu/marcus_makes_a_trade/,Marcus Makes a Trade.,"The bass still vibrated faintly in the floorboards from last night’s small celebration. Imani turned twenty-one, a milestone I both cherished and dreaded. Another year older, another year further from needing her old man, the aging hip-hop artist with a past that clung to him like the Chicago humidity in August. Forty-three years old, and half of them spent chasing a high, the white lines morphing into a gaping chasm in my life.

The music had given us a good life, a decent brick house in a quiet South Side neighborhood. Enough royalties trickled in to keep the bills paid and Imani in good schools. But the price… the price was etched into the ravaged landscape of my nasal cavity, a constant reminder of the powder that had once fueled my creativity and then, insidiously, consumed it. Ten years ago, the snorting became unbearable, the pain a sharp counterpoint to the fleeting euphoria. So, I’d made the brilliant decision to switch. Crack. The rock became my constant companion, a twisted muse that offered oblivion instead of inspiration.

This morning, the comedown was particularly brutal. My chest felt tight, a heavy band squeezing the air from my lungs. Panic flickered, sharp and unwelcome. “Just need some air,” I mumbled, pushing myself off the worn couch.

Stepping into the backyard, the familiar cityscape felt muted, the usual cacophony of city life strangely subdued. The sky, a pale grey canvas, seemed to mirror the unease in my chest. Then, it happened. A voice, smoother than a Stevie Wonder riff, calmer than Lake Michigan on a windless day, echoed from above.

“Marcus.”

My head snapped up, searching. There was nothing there, just the indifferent sky.

“Marcus,” the voice repeated, and this time, it resonated deep within me. “Today is the day.”

Then, he was there. Standing by the overgrown lilac bush, a man who looked exactly like Morgan Freeman. The same kind eyes, the same gentle smile, the same aura of quiet wisdom. And when he spoke, it was Morgan Freeman’s voice, a low, comforting rumble.

“Don’t be afraid, Marcus.”

My breath hitched. “Am I… am I talking to Morgan Freeman?”

He chuckled softly. “You can call me Death. I appear in a form that will not cause undue alarm. My true visage… well, let’s just say it wouldn’t be conducive to a peaceful transition. It tends to… linger in the memory.”

Death. Morgan Freeman. Standing in my Chicago backyard. The absurdity of it almost made me laugh, but the cold dread gripping my heart was too real.

“You have been a good father, Marcus,” he continued, his gaze unwavering. “For that, you are granted a peaceful departure. Your time is in two hours. There are a few things you must do.”

He outlined the instructions with a gentle authority. Shower. Sit with Imani. Tell her I loved her. Talk. At four o’clock, lie down for a nap in my bedroom. A profound weariness would claim me, and I would simply drift off. Four thirty-two. That was it. He assured me Imani would be alright, that her life would be full, even without me.

Numbly, I went inside. The shower felt like a baptism, washing away the grime of the night, but not the fear that clung to my skin. Imani was in the kitchen, humming softly as she rinsed her coffee cup.

Sitting at the table, the words felt thick in my throat. “Hey, baby.”

She smiled, that bright, open smile that always melted a piece of the ice around my heart. “Morning, Dad. You okay? You look a little… off.”

“Yeah, just tired,” I lied, my voice raspy. I reached across the table, taking her hand. Her skin was soft, so full of life. “I just wanted to tell you… I love you, Imani. More than anything.”

Her brow furrowed. “I love you too, Dad. You sound so serious.”

We talked. About her plans, her dreams, silly memories from when she was little. Every word felt precious, weighted with the knowledge of what was coming. I hugged her tight, the scent of her shampoo a familiar comfort.

Four o’clock arrived with a chilling punctuality. A bone-deep fatigue washed over me, just as Death had described. Imani looked at me with concern. “You really don’t look good, Dad. Maybe you should lie down.”

And that’s when the fear hit me, a tidal wave of pure, unadulterated terror. Never seeing her again. Never hearing her laugh. Never being there for her milestones. The thought was unbearable, a gaping void where my heart used to be.

Instead of heading to my room, I stumbled back outside, into the fading afternoon light. My voice cracked as I cried out, a desperate plea hurled into the uncaring sky. “Please! Anyone! God, Satan, whoever is listening! Just one more day! Just one more day with my daughter! I’ll give you anything! My soul! Everything I have! Just let me live one more day!”

The silence that followed was deafening. The clock ticked on, each second an agonizing reminder. Four thirty-two came and went. I was still breathing. Relief washed over me, so potent it almost buckled my knees. I had cheated death. I had won. Tears streamed down my face, a mixture of terror and elation. “I’ll change,” I vowed to the empty sky. “I’ll quit. For her. I’ll be the father she deserves.”

Two days later, the phone rang. A shrill, insistent sound that sliced through the fragile peace I had started to build. It was the police. There had been an accident. A drunk driver. Imani… Imani was gone.

The world tilted, the vibrant colors draining away, leaving only a stark, desolate grey. The calm voice from the sky, the gentle smile of the man who looked like Morgan Freeman, the promise of a peaceful death… it all echoed in my mind with a cruel, mocking irony. I had begged for one more day. I had been granted it. But it wasn't for me. It was for her last day. And I hadn't even known.",1,1744668519.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

A little about me is I have a very unconvential taste in music. Not to say i don't listen to what's popular, I try to. But considering my most recently added songs on my spotify i would classify as alternative hip-hop and ""country emo"", after explaining what ""Math Rock Jazz"" to a friend....

My great-grandfather, Jack “The Milk Man,” died there—collapsed by the churn with his boots on. The room had stayed sealed ever since, the cold stone cellar beneath it undisturbed.

Until now.

I was helping my mom and Aunt Linda get the old house ready to sell when the horror of my family history dragged me to hell on earth. My grandparents were both gone, and Linda didn’t want to waste money on upkeep.

“Not for nothin’, but burn the whole thing down for all I care,” she muttered, puffing her Marlboro Lights like an angry dragon. “This house is cursed and so are we. Mom never left me nothin’ good.”

She was right about that. Linda was a clone of my grandma but even less of a pleasant ray of sunshine with a cherry on top. Bitter, mean, jealous—the constant gossip. Her two sons were useless, like their father. Uncle Billy was a good guy, but Vietnam fucked him into a shell of himself who eventually checked out on the barrel of a shotgun.

Allan, the youngest, was a bedwetting mama’s boy, coddled into social awkwardness as a teen. He grew up to be an overweight dwarf, a wannabe teacher who took ten years to get a bachelor’s degree and still isn’t teaching.

His older brother, Jimmy, was a ""broke-dick"" Army cast-off who developed a southern accent by the age of sixteen, despite never living in the South. He was shorter than Allan, walked with his shoulders puffed out, and had this annoying laugh where he’d repeat the words he just said like they were the punchline.

Two sons. Two short-man complexes. All because of their miserable, overbearing mother and a Vietnam-warped dad who wasn’t there when they needed him. Linda was drunk—always. Like my grandparents. Breakfast was beer, lunch was a nap, and dinner was more beer—with a highball or two.

My grandparents raised them while she ran around town looking for a husband. She failed and ended up in this house living with Grandma. And it was bad. They were drunk 24/7 until Grandma finally kicked the bucket due to bladder cancer in August.

With her idiot sons unable to do much of anything, Mom and I had to lead the way. She felt bad for her sister and often yelled at me for being so critical of her, but I couldn’t help it. Linda was a cloud of negativity that drained the room when she walked in. An energy vampire.

Right after I had that exact conversation with Mom, Linda walked into the room and bled us dry. I was telling Mom what we needed to do to renovate an area of the house. It required me to get into the cellar, when Linda walked in with a beer in her hand.

“That cellar’s a shit hole. Nothin’ down there but old milk bottles and your grandma’s Avon collection. Be careful of them, honey, Jackie says we can sell ’em on the internet.”

“I will, Aunt Linda,” I said, getting up to escape the ignition of cancer sticks that would soon consume the room in a cloud of smoky doom. I grabbed a flashlight and went down into the cellar.

I always hated this place. It had that moist, musty smell unique to East Coast basements. Limestone and long winters created a dank, dark dungeon of terror for us all as kids. Jimmy and Allan often locked me in there to torture me. I swore I heard things in the dark that terrified me when I was eight, begging for sunlight on the other side of that creaky staircase.

But as I got older, I learned not to fear what was down there. I found some neat things, in fact—old ashtrays, bottle caps, even a Brooks Robinson baseball card that belonged to my uncle Bobby, who died in Vietnam. I still have it.

So when I went down there, that smell hit me and triggered a whole wave of memories, both good and bad. I found the area I needed, but the wall was crumbling. I pulled away a brick and a draft of cold, rank air overwhelmed me. I moved a few more, shined the light in, and found another space that had been walled off—who knows how long ago.

Inside was a little cove, frozen in time, with two generations of Schmidt milkmen’s legacy. There, I found the bottles—hidden behind old milking equipment, buried in soot and mouse nests. Thick green glass, the wax still unbroken after a century and a half. Labels yellow and curling:

**JACK’S TONIC: For Health, Long Life, and Fullness of Form. Cold-kept. Shake before sinning.**

Jack was Jack Jr.’s father (yeah, they were really original with names in my family)—my great-grandfather. The original “Milk Man,” though he never milked a cow in his life. He sold these tonics from a wagon, then an old truck, all over the Northeast. People said he was a healer. Others said he was a conman. Some swore he was a devil.

I brought one bottle upstairs. Aunt Linda saw it and nearly dropped her ashtray.

“That looks just like Daddy’s,” she said, reaching for it. “He used to say one sip kept him young. Two made him strong. Three made him see things.” She laughed through her emphysema-ridden lungs, but her eyes didn’t.

My mother left to take care of her dogs in Rochester, so I was stuck with Linda in the house that night. I prepped my tools for the next day’s demolition. Then I talked to my wife in Oregon and assured her I’d be done as fast as possible. She was four months pregnant with our first.

I heard Linda talking to herself as I hung up. I hid around the corner and watched her pacing around the house with a constant beer in her hand, chain-smoking. By 8 p.m., she was a drunken mess. She was out of beer and begged me to go get her more. I refused. She finally passed out.

I went out to meet some old friends, and when I came home, I found the bottle of tonic—empty.

I was worried she’d be dead. That stuff had to be rotten. But when I checked on her, she was snoring away on the couch, her nightgown revealing far too much. I slinked away in disgust to my room.

The next morning, she woke me up coughing. I got up, made coffee, and asked about the tonic. She owned up to it, said it tasted like licorice and milk. Said it made her bones tingle.

“I feel like a young woman again,” she said, rubbing her arms. “Like I could dance all night.”

I worked my ass off that day, rebuilding a wall while her cycle of drinking and napping continued. But there was a noticeable pep in her step—and she wasn’t nearly as miserable. She even ordered me dinner: my favorite roast beef and barbecue sub from Tony’s.

That night, I showered and crashed early. Slept like a log.

The next morning, her skin was… different. Pale and waxy. She was a bit more hunched over. As I sanded drywall, she walked up behind me. Her spine cast a warped shadow across the wall. I turned around. She smiled without blinking, said nothing, then slinked away. I swore her eyes flashed yellow, then turned green again.

That night, she didn’t need her glasses anymore. Her cough was gone. She watched TV, perched on the couch like a possum in a dress. As she laughed, her tongue looked longer. Her teeth—sharper.

Later, as I prepped tools, I heard her whispering to the cellar door. Singing. Something in German. I had no idea she knew German—she barely had a grip on English.

I did some digging. I took the bottle and examined the symbols on it. They were occult. Possibly druidic. I searched for “Jack’s Tonic” and found an eleven-year-old Reddit thread. The OP had found a bottle, too. Said it had strange ingredients, some unidentifiable. Others like mugwort and mandrake root—common in occult remedies.

Then came the chilling part.

Jack Sr.—my great-grandfather—was said to be a druidic conman whose “wonder-milk” was linked to disappearances in four states. Eventually, he was lynched.

Jack’s Tonic was a *milker*—a ritual in a bottle. A way to grow something ancient inside a human host until it was ripe enough to burst.

The final dose wasn’t meant to be consumed. It was meant to *deliver*.

When Aunt Linda drank the bottle, she didn’t just wake something up inside her.

She fed something else.

I locked my door and had trouble sleeping that night. I kept waking up every hour. The sounds of her creepy singing and visions of my horrific family shilling poison to people haunted me every time I closed my eyes.

Then I heard it. Loud and clear.

It was no dream. It was a horrific moan that curdled through the house. Just past three in the morning. I got up, put on my clothes, grabbed my phone, and turned on the flashlight.

I slowly opened the door and there it was again—that horrific groan. It was coming from downstairs. As I walked through the hallway toward the stairs, I could hear Aunt Linda’s faint whisper through the floorboards—deep, wet sounds, like something breathing through curdled lungs.

And the smell. It was putrid. Rotting sour milk, dead animals, and the rank of an old damp cave. The air was thick and stifling as I descended the stairs.

“Aunt Linda, you okay?” I called out, but she didn’t answer.

Then I heard a muffled yell from the cellar. It was her.

I sighed loudly, feeling like a fool. I’d gotten into my own head, reading Reddit conspiracies when really I was just watching my Aunt Linda fall deeper into dementia. I shook my head, realizing it was my duty to get her back upstairs and call my mother to get her into a home.

Determined and annoyed, I walked down the creaky stairs into the stench of the cellar.

She tackled me. I toppled down the stairs, breaking the banister. I smashed my head into the limestone wall and landed hard on my elbow, dropping my phone.

I tried to gather myself, but she was on top of me, hissing. She was strong, and her cold hands moved swiftly across my body, grabbing my throat.

I could smell her breath. Her yellow eyes gleamed like reptile eyes in the dim light of the cellar. Linda tried to force the last bottle down my throat, but I wouldn’t open my mouth. She dragged me over to the wall I had uncovered like a rag doll.

“You little pecker,” she growled. “You’re the missing piece. He’s thirsty again. It’s time to pay your dues to your family. Solidify your legacy. The family has to provide.”

Her skin flaked as she moved. Her hands cracked and re-formed with every gesture. Her voice wasn’t hers anymore—it was a wet, moaning thing, bubbling like spoiled cream. As she cackled and held me down, I saw a terrifying figure emerge from behind the wall.

In the shadows of the milk room, something ancient, rotten, and decrepit stirred. It lumbered forward and bellowed that unmistakable moan. It was an indescribable beast that perverted human form—its yellow piercing eyes tore right through me.

Before it could reach me, I reached into the darkness. I grabbed a metal pipe and fought her off with the broken stair rail. I drove it through her shoulder, and she fell into the creature. They both toppled over.

She shrieked so loud the walls shook.

I ran. The stairs collapsed behind me. I didn’t grab a thing—left my phone and my belongings. I grabbed my keys, hopped into my car, and peeled out into the moonlight. I drove the New York State Thruway trembling, that screech stuck in my head. I got to my mother’s house by morning and told her everything.

She was skeptical but had awoken to several messages from Linda that were clearly unhinged. She called the police, who were going to do a wellness check.

I took a shower and cried into the water silently, reliving the terror in my mind. As I was drying off, my mother knocked on the door and handed me her phone. It was my wife.

She was livid—screaming at me for the horrific messages I’d left her. I trembled as I explained what had happened. She was skeptical, as any normal person would be, and asked if I’d been doing drugs. I finally calmed her down and explained I didn’t have my phone.

I had to hang up on her when the police called my mother.

The house was on fire. The fire department was there now, putting it out.

They questioned me but confirmed it started after I had already arrived in Rochester.

As my mother hung up the phone, we received a forwarded message from my wife—from my phone.

We played it together.

“Hi honey… it’s Aunt Linda. I’m looking for your husband. See, he left me and his grandpa here in a bind. We need him.”

A pause. Heavy breathing. The voice was gravelly and deep, like a man trying to impersonate a woman—but with a tongue too big for their mouth.

“And if we can’t get him, well then, we’ll just take that precious little baby of yours. Matter of fact, that juicy little baby would be just what the doctor ordered for Grandpa. I’ll be in touch now. Bye, honey.”

I dropped the phone in terror. Mom hugged me. I called my wife, crying, and explained everything in more detail.

Time passed. I have a new phone. I’m back home, and the joy of my daughter’s birth has been a blessing. But the past is still unsettled.

When they sifted through the ashes, no human remains were found.

I hear the screeching at night in my dreams. I clutch my child closely and fear leaving her alone—ever. I see her face. I smell the milk. I dread the unspeakable horror of my family’s legacy coming for me and my baby girl.

I wonder when she’ll “be in touch.”

I know Linda is still waiting. Lurking.   
So is he. 

But so am I. Because my love for my daughter and our relationship is a powerful force, too.

1jzbefy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pureretention/comments/1jzbefy/weird_female_behavior_towards_retainers/,Weird female behavior towards retainers,"After I became a retainer, I started to notice some really strange behavior from the females around me. Now I am not sure if these behaviors were always there and just escaped my notice because of the mental fog I was in as a coomer, or if being a retainer just forces women to act this way. Either way, I was reminded of this ""female weirdness"" by incidents that occurred this weekend and wanted to share with my brothers on this sub. 

* Females creepily watching you from afar
   * I love spending Sunday mornings and early afternoons working at one of my local coffee shops. I usually get a drink, put my head phones in, and just get lost in my work. While I was working this last Sunday I could feel a woman blatantly staring at me for about 3 minutes from about 6 ft away. It is like she didn't care that she was staring. It actually felt like she was doing it intentionally to try and get my attention. Eventually, I felt so uncomfortable that I diverted my gaze towards her to nod and acknowledge her. She gave me the widest smile and then left the coffee shop. After she left I was like ""wait... was she just lingering in the coffee shop to see if she could get my attention? WTF... that's creepy LOL"" 
   * During that same Sunday work session at the coffee shop, another woman who must have been in her mid to late twenties came and sat right next to me even though there were at least 3-4 other empty seats around the coffee shop that she could have chosen. Back when I was a coomer, women would NEVER and I mean NEVER just voluntarily sit beside me if there were any open seats. For whatever reason, they now seem to have lost all fear and just come and sit uncomfortably close in a way that I cannot possibly not notice them. It is really strange. Anyhow, I am at a point in my life where I am just working on myself so I didn't  attempt to make conversation even though it seemed like she wanted me to. 
   * Every now and then, I will catch this woman that works across from me at work just blankly staring at me. This lady will actually stand up from her chair and gawk at me for a few minutes. I got so uncomfortable a couple of times that I actually asked her if she needed something from me. As soon as I asked her, she would snap back to reality, mumble some apology and return to her work slightly embarrassed. Strange. 
* Females getting unnecessarily close to you
   * Back when I was a coomer, it was like females had this invisible radar that made it almost impossible to get too close to them without their permission. It was like they could feel my presence and get out of the way long before I got anywhere near close to physical contact. This weekend, I stopped at the grocery store after my usual Sunday morning coffee shop work session to pick up some food. I got through shopping and was stood at the check out aisle just waiting to pay. After about 5 minutes, this lady who must have been in her late 40s walked right up to my side and bent right over apparently looking for some item in the little stalls they usually have in the check out aisles. I was startled because it was almost as if she didn't realize that I was standing right there. I just moved out of the way and gave her space until I could pay for my stuff and leave. I left the supermarket thinking ""WTF was that all about???"". 



Maybe I am overthinking things but I swear these things NEVER happened to me when I was a coomer. As a fully grown man, I haven't really changed in stature or looks since I became a retainer apart from growing a few specs of gray in my beard. I am not sure what it is... I am not sure what the women are doing... I am not even sure they know what they are doing. It is all very weird and has now happened too many times for this to be some sort of coincidence. It is almost like the more pure you become as a son of God, your mere presence seems to disrupt the bearings and/or operating system of the females around you. The funny thing is that women are usually known for being very discreet with their actions but all of that discretion seems to go out of the window when a retainer is involved and I have no clue as to why. Either way, it makes for entertaining dispassionate observation! 

  
Till next time brothers, Godspeed and remain blessed

A genuine connection. I’m not chasing labels or rushing into anything just open to something built on trust, depth, and presence. If it turns into a relationship, great. If it becomes a meaningful friendship, that’s just as valuable.

A bit about me:

By day, I’m a coder. I also have a master’s degree in nuclear physics and I’m preparing for my PhD which means lots of studying and a few late-night brain farts (GRE & TOEFL). Life can be intense, but I balance it with calm moments and simple joys.

I love long conversations over coffee, night walks, and getting lost in the quiet parts of a city. I prefer the hidden alleys where the real stories live.

One day, I will ride a motorcycle across Europe. The back seat’s open. maybe you’re the right kind of adventure?

Still planning my first tattoo, but first, I’m working on getting in shape. Got any ideas or cool ink stories? I’m all ears.

What I’m looking for:

Emotional maturity. Calm, kind energy. A connection where we can be real, not perform. I’m not into surface-level stuff. Just looking for someone who enjoys depth, curiosity, and the kind of quiet that doesn’t need to be filled.

If something here made you smile and say hi. Or tell me one small thing that made your day better. I’d love to hear it.

One hundred and eleven years ago - Archduke Franz Ferdinand was shot dead. It wasn't quite as simple as that, though!   
  
It's a great story - truth be told.

111 years ago, ""The Black Hand"" planned to assassinate him. They tried, and they made an arse of it.

The would-be assassins had put themselves in various positions along the Archduke's motorcade route. One of them simply shat it - lost his nerve - and did nothing. Another one didn't lose their nerve, and threw a grenade at the Archduke's car. 

It bounced off the car, and exploded on some other poor bugger.

And the rest of the Black Hand thought to themselves ""Fuck this"" - and off they fucked. Miserable and dejected - no doubt.

But here's where it gets weird:  
  
Later that day - Franz Ferdinand’s driver took a wrong turn.   
  
We've all been there before. You miss your exit and are forced to take a detour. It's commonplace. It's trivial.  
  
Then again - who among us can claim to have have caused a world war because of a wrong turn? 

This wrong turn lead the Archduke down a street. Not just any street - but a street that Gavrilo Princip, just happened to be standing.

Princip was a member of the Black Hand. Miserable and dejected as he surely was, the story is that he apparently went for a sandwich or a coffee.   
  
The mind boggles as to why he didn't go to a bar? As far as I am concerned - a mere sandwich or coffee requires suspension of disbelief. But I suppose seeing is believing?

And what did Princip see - who did he see - taking a wrong turn up shit creek? 

Only the bloody Archduke of Austria - Franz Ferdinand.

Not only that - but the driver stopped dead. He stalled the fucking car while trying to reverse. 

Who hired this guy? Wrong turns, stalling the car?  
  
These days you can't get an entry level job without years of experience - and maybe we have Ferdinand's driver to thank for that...

So what does Princip do? He does what anybody does when your in the right place at the right time - he ""[shoots his shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFYQQPAOz7Y)"". 

And what does Franz do? He does what anybody does when your in the wrong place at the wrong time - he takes a heroic dose of reality, right in the face.   
  
Sophie, his wife, took one as well - for good measure.

Same time, same place. Right place? Wrong Place? Same thing?

Anyway - then what? Well, blink and you'll miss it. We have the modern world. 

""War never changes"" - according to a popular video game. That's bullshit.

They say the universe is expanding. Not only that - the rate at which it expands is accelerating.

The rising population and the invention of machine guns, nuclear weapons and unmanned drones opened the door to expanding death tolls.  
  
Not only that - the rate at which it expands is accelerating.

Now - I'd love to stay and chat a bit more (and to talk about myself), of course I would.   
  
I want to talk about the whole idea of ""being in the right place at the right time"" - and I will, no doubt, do that soon.

But for now - I think we can all agree we are in the wrong place. The world is in the wrong place. 

But maybe, just maybe, it's not the wrong time?   
  
In the information age - with a population larger than there has ever been - maybe it really is the time for change.

Not with bullets - because that wouldn't be much of a change, would it? But with something. Somehow. Someway.

We know what to do you when you're in the right place at the right time. We know that you can't do shit when you're in the wrong place at the wrong time.

So what do we do when we're in the wrong place at the right time?

Once you have an answer to that question, you might just ask:  [What's stopping us?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7Sv3XaX4ko)

Idk if this is a soap stain or what but it no longer has the faint brown tinge of the coffee stain and instead looks splotchy or maybe I’ve spread it out so I’m worried I’ve made it worse??

I ended up sitting next to a woman (early 30s) I really admire, and enjoy talking to (she sat next to me).

We've had a few short but deep talks over the \~9 months I've been involved in this org, but we didn't work together. I have gotten the feeling that she might be interested in me, but I find it a bit hard to tell b/c she is an very bubbly person, and I'm not the best with social cues.

We talked a lot during the dinner, and I can say that I really enjoyed talking with her, and she seemed to really enjoy talking to me. This was the most time we've spent talking together. In my mind, we just seem to click. I certainly feel very comfortable around her.

When it was time to go we were having a bit of an awkward, prolonged ""so I guess I'll see you next season"" moment. I'd been wanting to ask her out for a while, and I realized it was now or a few months from now (and probably never at that point). So, I asked her if she'd like to grab coffee sometime and she agreed. When I left we locked eyes and smiled at each other for what felt like longer than normal, and it seemed somewhat intimate to me.

But, now I'm wondering, was I not explicit enough in making clear I wanted this to be a date? I'm worried I may have read the room wrong. When I text her, should I try to (subtly) make it clear I'm asking her on a date?

A few months go by and the only times I've worked a non-closing shift was when I picked one up when a coworker needed a cover. meanwhile no effort had been made to find a third closer outside of me and one other person while hiring two new openers only (7-4 no midshifts). So that brought it to 3 full time openers, 2 part time openers (one of which can work midshifts since we get trucks on Saturday) and still only 2 closers. 

Well I had finally had enough and told my ESM that I wouldn't be closing anymore. I told them I would work my remaining schedule, but after that I would only work til 10 PM. the two weeks go by and I work my scheduled shifts with no issue. that brings me to now, I have been given 2 shifts in a two week period while my coworkers still maintain high hours, 40 and 30 each. the week after that I have nothing.

I do have a history with tardiness and because I live about 20 minutes away they pretty much tell me don't bother coming in if it's more than 30 minutes past my shift, but this was before I was put on nightshifts and since then I have worked and fixed my bad habits. the few opening and mid shifts I have worked I have shown up on time and even been early enough to offer to get coffee for my SLs and ESM.

I'm aware it's the time of year where our hours get cut, but I've worked here almost 2 years and never once had anything like this happen til my current ESM stepped up from SL, especially considering one coworker only had a minor cut in hours and the other, who is only 2 weeks new, has had no cut in hours whatsoever.

	•	consistent espresso
	•	solid build quality
	•	simple but effective design, focused on espresso only

	3.	And on the coffee side: What are your favorite beans for this kind of setup?

One of my friends lives in Virginia Minnesota, she and her husband are celebrating their second anniversary this year but it’s their first year actually living together - my friend is Canadian (I am too) and only got her visa to live and work down there last fall. I’ve been trying to think of a cute gift I could send them, and with e-cards etc being a thing I was thinking maybe there is a cool restaurant or museum or something that I could buy them a gift card or pass to. I’ve never been to Virginia, so I figured Reddit might have some ideas?

They are both nerdy - they love Star Wars, LOTR, video games (top games for my friend include SDV, Coral Island, Baldurs Gate, Portal, not 100% about her husband but I know they play together). She is incredibly artistic, she paints and makes music, I know music is a shared interest too. No allergies I can think of, but my friend doesn’t drink coffee, her husband does. I think they’d maybe be up for a short road trip if there was a worthwhile experience (like within 2 hours drive), but they spent the first half of their marriage driving back and forth across the border to see each other, I don’t think they really want to do more road trips than necessary 😅 

I also don’t want to get anything that is too scheduled (ie concert tickets) as I’d have to confirm their schedules and that would ruin the surprise, but I like the idea of either a gift basket that can be delivered on/around their anniversary, or a gift card they can use at their discretion. I’d either be getting an electronic version sent to their email or delivered directly to them as I don’t think I have time to order it to come here first.

Looking for the [best SEO in Vancouver](https://jooska.ca/seo-vancouver/)? As the coffee-drinking-est web agency this side of the Rockies, Jooska is a Canadian team offering SEO to boost your website's performance. Recent years have seen the bulk of the SEO industry, especially overseas, focus on quick gains and short-termism–a strategy that won’t cut it for businesses that want to distinguish themselves as industry leaders and achieve consistent year-over-year growth.

[SEO](https://jooska.ca/seo-vancouver/) is essential to websites when local residents are your target market. Whether it’s yoga classes, teeth whitening, or plumbing, if you rely on community traffic and want to use your website as a source of bookings and inquiries, you need [Search Engine Optimization](https://jooska.ca/seo-vancouver/).

# Quick, Cheap, and Other Red Flags

Globally, SEO is already a $70 billion industry, and it’s only expected to grow. The tremendous competition has superheated the competition, resulting in a type of malpractice where some agencies or consultants guarantee quick results through practices like invisible keyword stuffing, link purchasing, and deceptive redirects. The point is to manipulate search engine algorithms and artificially inflate keyword rankings. If you’re in business for any time, you’ve likely been inundated with spammy emails promising to turn your website into an unstoppable lead generator in a month. The problem is that bad SEO practices, known as Black Hat SEO, tend to backfire like an Acme boobytrap purchased by Wile E. Coyote.

Search engines like Google always watch for bad behaviour, penalizing it when they find it. From losing dozens of ranks to having your website completely disindexed, businesses that engage in harmful practices can see leads dry up overnight. No one likes a cheat.

There’s a lot of money to be made from ranking well for popular search terms. So much so that search engines are fiercely protective about how they rank websites, only releasing broad parameters for best practices to stop people from trying to game the system. It’s up to legitimate [SEO agencies](https://jooska.ca/seo-vancouver/) to stay on top of the blink-and-you'll-miss-it trends, authorities, and resources, ultimately acting as a guide and advocate for your website on the World Wide Web.

# Good, Better, Best Practices SEO

For all the internet advancements, there are no magic bullets for Search Engine Optimization. If you’re a local business looking for the [best SEO in Vancouver](https://jooska.ca/seo-vancouver/), be aware that it’s an unglamorous, time-consuming process.

* Title and Description Optimization - Add compelling title tags and meta descriptions that reflect page content.

- Katie: Yeah, we're cool. But we don't go get lunch. We, okay, we still have dogs and they primarily live with him. But I love those guys so much that I can't never see them. So we mostly talk about dogs and.

So did you see him more post-divorce because you filmed? Would you have not seen him as much? (Timestamp: 39:37)
- Katie: I mean, yeah, just maybe for the dogs, because we did, we did a week on week off. It was really intense. But yeah, I mean, obviously, filming the show post-divorce was a really strange place to be.
- Katie: And I wanted us to be in a really good place because he, he also wanted…
- Dayna: Going through the divorce on camera. 
- Katie: Yeah, I mean, we had to live together for five months because our house was getting repaired before we could sell it. And so that was interesting. But we got along the whole time. It was very amicable, very peaceful. But then, of course, when we started filming, everything went crazy.
- Katie: So it was just it became hard to even do that. That's just which is why this past year, like after our last season, I was like, I'm not coming back to the show. And now they've recast the whole thing.
- Katie: I just was like, I'm friends with one person. I really can't stand the rest of them. And even though Tom and I are cool, I don't want to keep you with my ex-husband, go on vacation.

So I was going to ask you, where's everybody now today? You don’t talk to anyone? (Timestamp: 40:32)
- Katie: Are they at home? I talk to Ariana because we're close and we also have a business together. But no, I'm pretty much done with everybody. They can…
- Crystal: You’re like over it
- Katie: Yeah. I mean, and then there's, I mean, there's people that no longer on our show that I'm friends with Kristen and Stassi, but yeah, the rest of them, it just, it got to a really negative place.

Are you surprised it ended? Like the last day of filming, is it like, this is it? I mean, you guys did it for a very long time (timestamp: 40:55)
- Katie: No, not last day of filming, but that's where the things are now with them, like rebooting it with an entire new cast. It was a little shocking because like they could barely bring new people into our seasons in the past year. Now you're just going to scrap everybody and…
- Crystal: Because your last season was huge ratings. I’m actually shocked they…
- Katie: Because well, there wasn't a way for coming back. I mean, Ariana was not going to ever talk to Tom Sandoval again. I think there was a world in which maybe they didn't bring back everybody, but there's people I think still willing to play ball. But it just it wasn't the same dynamic, the same group. We were very, very severed.
- Katie: So I get it. But yeah, the reboots feels a little strange because I'm like, why don't you just call it something else? Just do a new show. Why are you doing a season 12 of a show that's not a season 12?

Dayna saying no to filming (Timestamp: 44:37)
- Dayna: And so I was asked back for nine, said no, asked back for 10, said no. And then I came on part of 11 as a friend of. I did one day of filming and quit the next day.
- Crystal: It was that hard
- Dayna: Yes, it was so because earlier you were like, maybe if I had more distance and whatever, it was like so triggering. And I just immediately the next morning, I woke up and had a panic attack and called the showrunner and was like, no, sorry, can’t do this. 

Reality shows they could do (Timestamp: 47:25)
- Katie said she would do Traitors and Dayna said Big Brothers or Traitors
- Dayna: But I think in hindsight, and we talked about this earlier, but I would never if it was a reality show that's like a Vanderpump or Housewives or whatever, I would never join an established show as a new person coming in would not happen. 
- Dayna: So it's not like I wouldn't ever do television again, but it would not be in that scenario. And it would also would not be a scenario in which I had to pretend to be a server
- Dayna: And there's nothing wrong with that. But when I'm not, I have to pretend any part of my life because I'm a very, we both are, wear it on our sleeves, say what we think and feel, it is not possible for me.
- Crystal: So I know the faking. I think, I don't even know if I'm allowed to say this, but like Selling Sunset, like half of them were not agents when they started that show, they're models and actors. And then they got their license to film the show.
- Katie: I mean, that is one of the most difficult parts, living authentically, being on a show. So being on something where there's another objective, where it's like, because I just, I was not someone who was easily manipulated by a production company.
- Katie: I was like, I need to stand ten toes down on this. I'm not going to just say whatever you want, because if I have to do press and interviews and this and that, I need to be able to own everything I've said before. And I don’t, I will try to compromise….
- Crystal: Well, that's what I'm saying. When you pretend to be a server, then you have to like follow that line. When you start doing like interviews later, it's very hard on you.
- Dayna: Well, and they made me like stick to this really specific thing. They're like, yeah, I was doing stand-up comedy, so I wanted to be a server. I had a really well-paying job. What are you talking about? I would like to leave meetings with the CEO of a hospital talking about an $8 million deal and then go talk about goat cheese balls.
- Crystal: Because it doesn't make sense for you to be a server if you have that job.
- Dayna: But I understand that I was just a random, so they needed to fit me in that universe. But it is hard because you then have to try and keep it up.
- Katie: You have to pretend like you’re broke and hungry for years on the show
- Dayna: And I also understand, though, just to be fair to production Bravo, there's people eat up what they eat up from a viewer perspective. So I understand they also have a job to bring out the things that are going to be most interesting for the viewer. But sometimes it doesn't align with who you are as a person privately.

When Dayna met Katie and how Katie was portrayed on the show (Timestamp: 54:18)
- Dayna: Well, honestly, I, because just of seeing the Vanderpump that I did watch, was totally nervous to meet Katie. The first or maybe it was my second day filming or whatever. We came to your house and I was like tense. I was like, oh, these girls are going to be so mean to me. I don't know them, whatever. And she was so warm and immediately hugged me. And we clicked that day
- Katie: But I don't think I was, I was not portrayed as true form on that show. But there's nothing I do about it. I was like, yeah.

What was like your character on the show? (Timestamp: 54:45)
- Katie: A little hot headed or like, you know, those like the tequila key, the rage.

- Crystal: Hotheaded is not what I would say 
- Katie: So when there's other people, there was a lot of people just such bullshit around me. And I just I could not handle that. I did not do well with people that just like acted like fools all the time. So like my patience was really…
- Cynthia: Now that I could see, you seem like you're kind of like a real one. 
- Katie: But I’m also really nice
- Crystal: But the dynamic probably pushed you to like blowing up, right?

The screen fades in from black. The low hum of a narrator's voice begins, echoing like a voice from the past.

Narrator (calm, authoritative tone):

""The year was 2112. Humanity, in its ceaseless pursuit of progress, had failed to notice the quiet but insidious arrival of an enemy—an enemy unlike any seen before.""

The camera slowly zooms out from a dusty old Earth map, showing regions marked with faded borders and the chaotic scene of human activity: cities, spaceports, crowded streets. A sudden flash of a new starburst in the night sky interrupts the serenity.

Narrator:

""The invasion was subtle at first. Ships unlike anything Earth had seen, cloaked by advanced psychic technology, descended on our planet in the dead of night. No bombs, no missiles. Instead, they arrived as shadows—floating, silent, and ever-watchful.""

The screen flashes to black-and-white footage of cities, bustling with life before the invasion. People going about their business, unaware that their way of life was about to be forever changed. A shift in the soundtrack occurs, eerie tones creeping in.

Narrator:

""And then, the mind control began. It was subtle—at first. The aliens, who we would come to call the 'Psyluuks,' were unlike any species humanity had encountered. Duck-like in appearance but with an unsettling intelligence, their psychic abilities immediately began to affect us. They controlled not through force, but through the mind, pushing us into a state of passive obedience.""

Cut to images of civilians in the streets—eyes glazed over, moving in synchronized patterns, not reacting to their surroundings. Psychically-controlled humans going about daily tasks like drones.

Narrator:

""Any aggression was eliminated. The Psyluuks could suppress the human will, removing all desire to resist or rebel. Yet, they permitted life to continue—though it was not the life we knew. No longer free to make choices, humans became mere shadows of themselves.""

The documentary footage transitions to showing the Psyluuks walking through city streets, their duck-like faces impassive. Their presence induces fear in the populace, even if they cannot act on it.

Narrator:

""Perhaps the most insidious of their demands was the Vegan Law—a diet forced upon humanity in homage to their own herbivorous nature. Meat, the symbol of strength and autonomy for so many civilizations, was eradicated from human culture. Those who resisted were swiftly punished. A mind controlled by the Psyluuks could never break, lest it lead to an agonizing death: a brain aneurysm triggered by defiance.""

The footage shifts to a public execution—an alien Psyluuk calmly watching as a human who attempted to resist is struck down, his head violently exploding in a grisly display.

Narrator:

""The Psyluuks were not merciful. They were efficient. They were gods among men, and humanity was to live only for their amusement. But they underestimated us. They did not realize the power of the human spirit—or the hunger that lies within it.""

The screen slowly transitions to an image of Earth, divided and controlled. The camera slowly pulls out, showing the familiar but now oppressive world.

Narrator:

""This is where our story begins. In the quiet moments before the storm—before the first crack in the Psyluuk’s perfect control was found.""

The Meeting: James and Claudia

The restaurant hums with soft chatter, the faint clinking of silverware on fine china, and the warm glow of soft lighting. A picture-perfect evening, as far as first dates go. A screen flickers to life, revealing the familiar setting of an upscale yet cozy dining spot. A narrator’s voice is absent, replaced by the laughter and light sounds of human interaction—free, alive, and untouched by the dark grip of the Psyluuks.

James (fidgeting nervously, adjusting his glasses for the umpteenth time)

""So, you like coffee, huh?""

Claudia (smiling softly, her hands clasped neatly in front of her)

""I do, actually. I work at a coffee house, if you can believe it.""

James (grinning, trying to ease the nerves with a pun)

""A coffee house, huh? I guess that makes you... the brew-tiful barista, huh?""

Claudia chuckles, her cheeks tinged with pink as she looks down at her menu. James’ eyes sparkle with mischief, not realizing how his awkwardness is actually making her warm up to him.

Claudia (softly, blushing but playful)

""You're full of puns, aren't you?""

James (nervously rubbing the back of his neck)

""I... uh, guess it's my way of coping with awkward silence. Though, I’m pretty sure the coffee here could make up for it.""

The two share an easy laugh, the conversation flowing more comfortably than either of them expected. It’s the kind of awkward charm that makes first dates delightful.

James (grinning sheepishly)

""Okay, okay, but seriously, I didn’t know someone could be this... cute and run a coffee house. Do you come with a latte magic or is that just my imagination?""

Claudia (laughs, shaking her head but clearly enjoying the exchange)

""Well, thank you. I like to think my coffee is magic, but you seem to be a bit of a magician yourself. An IT tech and a pun master? Quite the combo.""

James (with a wink, shrugging)

""I try. But if I’m being honest, I usually just run the coffee maker and let the magic happen. Unlike you, I’m still trying to figure out the code for romance.""

Claudia's smile widens as she looks at James with something that seems like curiosity mixed with a spark of genuine affection. She’s shy, yes, but there's an undeniable connection here. She’s nervous too—yet there’s something comforting in his humor and humble charm.

The low murmur of conversation fills the restaurant, a bubble of normalcy in a world that seems so perfectly controlled. The delicate clink of silverware, the soft rustling of menus, and the gentle hum of background music create an atmosphere of quiet comfort.

But then, like the sudden tension before a storm, something shifts. It’s subtle at first—an almost imperceptible shift in the air, a static charge that seems to ripple through the room. The patrons pause mid-conversation, their voices faltering, the hum of the restaurant’s warmth growing suddenly strained. A thin layer of discomfort settles over everyone.

James and Claudia glance at each other, a fleeting moment of confusion. Neither of them can place it, but the air feels... off. Like the room itself is holding its breath.

Claudia (quietly, a soft frown appearing)

""Do you feel that?""

James (shifting uncomfortably in his seat, a slight shiver down his spine)

""Yeah... it's like... a bad vibe, right?""

The door to the restaurant creaks open, slow and deliberate. As it does, the low hum of conversation quiets even further. The patrons’ smiles fade, their eyes flickering nervously toward the door. Every movement slows, as though the world itself is holding a collective breath.

In walks a Psyluuk, its duck-like form towering, its presence all-encompassing. The air around it seems to warp, charged with a psychic energy that sends a wave of nausea through the room. The door closes behind it with a finality that resonates like a lock snapping shut.

The Psyluuk settles into its chair at the center of the restaurant with an almost bored grace, the sound of its feathery body making a soft rustle as it adjusts. The other patrons sit frozen, still too stunned to act. Its sharp black eyes scan the room as it lazily waves a hand toward a waiter, who nervously approaches.

Psyluuk (smiling thinly, its voice smooth and dripping with condescension)

""Ah, such a quaint establishment. Must be so nice to have us here, right? To know that everything, everything you do, is exactly as it should be. You’re welcome, of course.""

The Psyluuk doesn’t wait for a reply, clearly uninterested in anything the humans might have to say. Its arrogant posture is clear—an almost mocking confidence in the complete control it exerts. It leans back in its chair, surveying the room with the smug satisfaction of one who holds absolute dominion over those around it.

Psyluuk (calling to the waiter)

""I'll have something simple. A soy-based dish, of course. Perhaps the seared tofu with a side of sautéed mushrooms? It is the healthiest option, after all.""

The waiter, still visibly shaken but unwilling to show resistance, nods hurriedly and scurries off to the kitchen. The Psyluuk's attention shifts back to the room, its cold eyes narrowing as it observes the other patrons.

Psyluuk (casually, with a light chuckle)

""You know, I truly don’t understand how you humans survive without the luxury of our guidance. It must be so difficult, so... unpredictable.""

It shifts its gaze to Claudia, who sits stiffly, her hands clutching the edge of the table. She’s clearly trying to keep herself composed, but her face betrays her discomfort.

Psyluuk (mockingly, its voice a silky command)

""Claudia, yes? Come here, child. It’s time you show your gratitude, yes?""

The Psyluuk’s psychic influence presses down, a heavy weight that wraps around Claudia’s mind like a vice. Against her will, she begins to move. She stands up slowly, her body no longer her own, the invisible hand of control steering her across the restaurant to the alien’s table.

Claudia’s eyes are wide with terror, her body trembling, but she cannot stop herself. She approaches the Psyluuk with the grace of a puppet, her will entirely overridden. She stops just in front of it, her hands shaking.

Psyluuk (grinning, delighted by the sight)

""Thank you, Claudia. That’s the least you can do. Go ahead, hug me. Show your appreciation for the peace we’ve brought.""

And then, as if driven by some external force, Claudia’s arms open and she wraps them around the Psyluuk in a forced, uncomfortable embrace. Her face is flushed with embarrassment, but the alien’s smirk only deepens.

James watches, his heart racing. Something inside him snaps. He feels his jaw clench, the muscles in his neck tightening. His hands tremble, but he can’t make himself move. The anger, the defiance—it bubbles up within him, but it feels like trying to grab hold of a well-oiled lead ball, slippery and impossible to control.

James (muttering under his breath)

""This... this is wrong. This can’t be real...""

But it is real. He knows it. The alien’s influence is tangible, suffocating. The anger inside him rises, but it’s like his body refuses to respond—like his limbs have been trapped in molasses, thick and sticky, holding him back from action.

James watches helplessly as Claudia is forced to bow her head in gratitude, the tears in her eyes a silent cry for help. There’s no way to fight this—not here, not now.

Psyluuk (smiling, almost enjoying the discomfort)

""Such obedient creatures, aren’t you? You should be grateful. Without us, what would you do? Do you even remember a time when things weren’t this easy?""

The Psyluuk sits back in its chair, its wings folding in front of it, as it casually waves one hand, directing the conversation as if it owns the entire room.

Psyluuk (mockingly)

""Homelessness? A relic of the past. Gone with the wind, as they say. Unemployment? A thing of yesterday. The need for jobs has vanished, because we've taken over every industry. No more struggling. No more pain. Only perfect order.""

James grits his teeth, his hands still twitching, trying to move, but every inch of him feels frozen in place.

Psyluuk (continuing, smug)

""Jobs? Oh, you’ll still have them, but you’re welcome to work only four days a week. No more stressful grind. What’s that? You don’t need to work for money anymore? Well, that’s the beauty of it all, isn’t it? You don’t even remember the chaos that came before. No more starvation. No more uncertainty. Life is so much better now.""

The Psyluuk's words hang in the air, chilling in their calm certainty, as Claudia slowly backs away, still under its psychic control, the brief hug now ended.

The other patrons sit frozen, barely moving, barely breathing, as the alien’s words hang heavy in the room. For a brief moment, everything feels impossibly still—like a world held at the edge of a knife, suspended by the Psyluuk’s will.

Section 4: A Brief Moment of Calm – The Taste of Freedom

James and Claudia sit in silence for a moment, the weight of the alien's presence still pressing heavily on them. The hum of the restaurant, the clink of silverware, the murmur of distant conversations—all of it feels distant now, almost muffled by the lingering tension. But they both know they need to move past it. They need to act as though nothing has happened. To pretend that everything is alright.

Claudia is the first to speak, her voice soft, almost hesitant as she glances at James.

Claudia (whispering)

""We... we should just act normal, right? It's... it's not like we can do anything about it.""

James nods slowly, swallowing his unease. He’s still fighting the odd sensation that something is wrong, but he doesn’t want to alarm Claudia further. He tries to offer a reassuring smile, though his lips feel tight.

James (forcing a light chuckle)

""Yeah... normal. Just a regular dinner, like we planned, right? No big deal. We can handle this. I mean, what’s a little... mind control between friends, right?""

Claudia chuckles nervously, trying to match his energy, but the laugh doesn’t reach her eyes. She reaches across the table, her hand brushing his for a moment as she takes a steadying breath.

Claudia

""Right. It's fine. We’re fine. Everything’s fine.""

James nods, his hand lingering on hers for a moment before pulling away. They both know the facade they’re putting on is fragile, but they need it. They need the illusion of normalcy, if only for a few more minutes.

They both sit back, attempting to relax as the waiter finally arrives with their orders. It’s a small moment of comfort—a tiny bit of peace in the midst of the tension.

James (with a small smirk)

""So, uh, you said you liked the vegan lasagna, right? You should definitely try this one. It’s... well, it’s supposed to be the best.""

Claudia (smiling weakly)

""I trust you. I’m sure it’s... delicious.""

They try to get back into their light banter, the rhythm of their conversation awkward at first, but slowly returning as they push aside the alien's presence. But then, just as they start to relax, the sound of a chair scraping across the floor breaks the fragile calm.

Psyluuk (voice like gravel)

""I asked for brown mushrooms, not these... shitake mushrooms!""

The waiter stands frozen, trembling, his face pale. His hands shake as he stammers an apology, but it is already too late. The Psyluuk does not want apologies; it wants compliance. The alien’s hand, sleek and dangerous, moves with terrifying precision, its claws extending slightly, and a low hum builds in the air—a warning.

Psyluuk (voice icy, slow)

""You’re lucky I don’t have you executed for this... but I’m in a generous mood. Maybe.""

Before anyone can process what’s happening, the Psyluuk snaps its fingers. A sharp crack fills the air, and suddenly, the waiter’s head jerks back as if an invisible force just slammed into him. His eyes bulge, and a faint, horrific sound—the softest crack—echoes as the waiter’s skull is crushed by the alien’s psychic grip.

James and Claudia both gasp in horror, the sudden violence cutting through the thick atmosphere like a knife. The waiter’s body crumples to the floor with a sickening thud, a pool of blood quickly spreading beneath him. The patrons around them are too stunned to move, their faces pale as ghosts. But the Psyluuk? It seems almost bored by the act, as though taking a life was nothing more than swatting a fly.

Psyluuk (shrugging, nonchalant)

""Such a simpleton. You’d think they’d learn. But no—I am the one who decides what is correct, and what is not.""

The alien reclines back into its seat, a smug grin spreading across its feathery face. It doesn’t seem to care that it just took a human life in front of everyone in the restaurant. In fact, it’s as if it expects everyone to quietly accept it.

James’ stomach lurches. He feels the surge of rage building within him—his hands are shaking under the table, and his mind is screaming. The tension is unbearable. Claudia, beside him, squeezes his hand, her own face ashen, her eyes wide with terror.

Claudia (softly, barely above a whisper)

""James... we need to get out of here... we can’t...""

But James can’t move. The weight of the Psyluuk's power is like a physical force, pressing down on him, making his limbs heavy and unwilling to act. It’s as if his body has lost all control over itself.

The Psyluuk watches them both for a moment, its beady eyes scanning their faces. Then, with a single flick of its wrist, it dismisses them, its attention already moving on to its next indulgence.

Suddenly, something shifts in the air. The Psyluuk, still smug and comfortable in its seat, starts to look a little less content. It scans the room again, its eyes narrowing as it turns to the waiter’s body on the floor. But the waiter is no longer a problem—it’s the mushroom situation that is.

The Psyluuk sits up straighter now, its wings fluttering slightly as it waves a clawed hand toward the kitchen. The tension in the air rises again. It wants more.

Psyluuk (snarling)

""You... brought me the wrong mushrooms?! This is unacceptable. I demand better treatment from all of you! You should have known.""

The restaurant becomes even more unnervingly quiet. But before anyone can react, the Psyluuk raises a clawed hand and smashes the table in front of it with a brutal gesture, the wood cracking violently under its grip.

Psyluuk (shouting, almost childishly)

""No one disappoints me again. NO ONE!""

(If you are hearing this on Youtube or Tiktok, please reachout to Mr\_G63 as this story was stolen)

The alien’s fury erupts in a violent explosion of sound and motion as it slams its clawed fist onto the table. The force of the impact cracks the wood with a sharp splintering sound—the air is thick with the crackle of tension. The Psyluuk’s psychic energy surges, radiating like a storm, pushing the restaurant’s atmosphere to a breaking point. The tension, once palpable, is now a suffocating, oppressive weight. And just as quickly, it sets the stage for a series of catastrophic accidents.

The staff—already jittery from the alien's oppressive presence—flinch at the sound. One waiter, a young man with a nervous twitch, drops a tray of glasses, sending them crashing to the floor. The clattering of shattered glass is a discordant backdrop to the Psyluuk's continued outburst.

As the staff scrambles to clear the scene, the chaos spreads. One waitress, attempting to clean the bloodied mess from the fallen waiter’s body, slips on the crimson pool that has stained the floor. She tumbles forward, her arms flailing wildly, and collides with another waiter who’s holding a flaming dessert tray—Just Desserts, a flambéed chocolate mousse, its blue flame dancing in the air.

The collision is like a slow-motion disaster. The flaming dessert flies from the tray and arcs through the air, landing with a sizzling hiss on the Psyluuk’s billowing feathers. In an instant, the fire catches, the flames licking hungrily at the alien’s body. The Psyluuk screeches in shock, its wings flaring out as it stumbles backward, now fully ablaze.

The fire spreads quickly across its delicate, fiery plumage, the flames curling up like the tendrils of a hellish inferno. The Psyluuk thrashes wildly, its psychic powers destabilizing under the intensity of the burn. The room erupts into sheer panic as patrons jump from their seats, some diving under tables to escape, others yelling in terror.

Psyluuk (howling in pain)

""What is this?! You dare?! How dare you—""

The alien's voice cracks and warps as the fire consumes it. The flames seem to ignite every nerve in its body, and for the first time since its arrival, the Psyluuk is no longer in control. Its psychic grip weakens as the searing pain overrides its ability to maintain focus. The once confident, unyielding force that had manipulated and controlled everyone in the room is reduced to an animalistic frenzy.

As the Psyluuk stumbles, it careens into one of the restaurant’s decorative columns, knocking it off balance. It crashes to the floor in a heap of burning feathers and flesh, its screeching now drowned by the crackling of the fire. The entire room is a whirlwind of chaos, and in the middle of it all, James and Claudia find themselves rooted to their seats, paralyzed by a mix of horror and disbelief.

James (gritting his teeth, struggling to speak)

""Is it... really... dead?!""

Claudia’s wide, shocked eyes flicker between the flames and the alien’s charred body. She’s frozen, her mind struggling to process the sudden eruption of violence and chaos. Her hand grips James’ tightly, trying to ground herself.

Claudia (her voice trembling)

""It’s burning... Oh my God, it’s really burning!""

The heat from the flames pushes against their skin, the pungent smell of scorched feathers and burning flesh filling the air. But amidst the violence, something strange starts to happen. The air begins to feel lighter. The oppressive weight of the Psyluuk’s control is starting to loosen. The mind-numbing haze that had clouded their thoughts begins to lift.

James feels it first—a strange, unfamiliar clarity washing over him. The anger that had been a smoldering ember in his chest now bursts into full flame, sharp and alive. For the first time, he feels in control, aware of his own will. His grip on reality has returned.

He looks at Claudia, her expression still frozen in shock, and a spark of something else—something deeper, more primal—runs through him. The anger, the need to act, floods his thoughts. He knows now: they can fight back.

But just as quickly, something new takes hold. A scent. A strange, intoxicating scent fills the air—a mixture of the alien’s charred flesh and the sweet, crispy burning that is almost too familiar. It’s... delicious.

The smell is like a trigger, a buried instinct that James can’t quite explain. His stomach growls involuntarily, but his mind begins to race. This scent—this taste of freedom—fills his senses, something ancient stirring inside him. The fire in his mind burns hotter, sharper.

Claudia gasps, her eyes wide with realization. She’s feeling it too—something about this moment feels different. She’s not sure how, or why, but the fire is doing something to their minds, breaking open a floodgate of memories and desires long buried under the control of the Psyluuk.

The Psyluuk twitches one last time, its body fully consumed by the flames. The air grows still again, the crackling of the fire now the only sound that fills the room. And then—an eerie silence. As the last of the alien’s life ebbs away, something else happens. As the smell of freedom filled their minds, James and Claudia became puppets to an older, more primitive Master.

The scent—sweet, savory, and tinged with the acrid burn of the alien’s body—drifts like an invisible current, wrapping itself around their senses. James breathes deeply, the scent mingling with the sharp tang of fear and smoke in the air. It’s intoxicating, more intoxicating than anything he’s ever experienced. His pulse quickens, his mouth watering in a way he’s never known. He tries to fight it, tries to push the thought from his mind, but the urge, the hunger, is undeniable.

Claudia’s breath hitches beside him, her body stiffening as she stares at the charred remains of the Psyluuk. Her eyes flicker with confusion, her hand still clutching his, but as the heat from the fire presses against her skin, she feels an overwhelming, instinctual pull. Her feet, as if moving of their own volition, inch forward. She’s powerless against it.

James (his voice tight, strained)

""Claudia... no, we can't. This... we shouldn’t—""

But the words sound hollow even to his own ears. He can feel it—an insatiable need to consume, to tear into the charred flesh before him. The thought of stopping is impossible. His hands tremble, fingers itching to touch the body.

Claudia’s eyes meet his for a fleeting moment, a mixture of terror and desire swimming in her gaze. Without a word, she steps closer, her movements slow and deliberate, as if something inside her has clicked into place. She reaches forward, her fingers brushing against the crispy skin of the Psyluuk. The texture is foreign, alien, but her hand moves again without thought, pulling a piece of the roasted meat from the charred corpse.

James watches, transfixed. His chest tightens with a rush of conflicting emotions. Part of him wants to stop her, to force her to snap out of it, but his own body betrays him. He feels his legs move, taking him toward the alien corpse, the smell overwhelming him. His own hand reaches out, trembling, but there’s no fight left in him. The pull is too strong.

He takes a piece of the Psyluuk’s flesh in his hand. His fingers press into the crispy surface, the meat giving way with a satisfying crunch. Without thinking, he brings it to his mouth.

The moment the meat touches his tongue, a jolt of energy pulses through him—sharp, electric. It’s as if something inside him snaps, unleashing a flood of primal instincts that had been buried for far too long. The world around him sharpens, the haze of mind control clearing in an instant. He feels alive—more awake than he’s ever been. The taste is nothing short of euphoric, a rush of flavors he can’t describe, but the clarity is unmistakable. He feels free.

Claudia, too, is consumed by the same reaction. As she chews, her eyes widen in shock and awe. The strange, alien taste overwhelms her senses, flooding her with a sense of power, of control. The psychic chains that had once held her tight loosen, snap, and shatter. She feels the surge of freedom inside her—a freedom she never knew she had lost.

But it’s more than just the taste of the meat. There’s something chemical happening within them, something beyond the food itself. The cells in their bodies react, almost as if the Psyluuk’s essence is seeping into their very bones, rewiring their minds. The animalistic hunger, once an uncontrollable impulse, now becomes their strength, their resistance. The chemical reaction is like a switch, something irreversible.

James feels it first—his thoughts clearing, the constant pressure of psychic control lifting like a fog dissipating under the sun. He’s awake. He’s himself. The sensation is both overwhelming and liberating. And as Claudia looks at him, her eyes now sharp, her expression fierce, he knows that something has changed. For the first time, they are truly free.

The rush is like a wave, cresting with explosive force. It’s a feeling of invincibility, of power that they never knew they possessed. Their thoughts, their emotions, are their own once more. They are no longer puppets of the Psyluuk—they have become something else entirely. Something primal. Something dangerous.

James’s gaze shifts from Claudia to the burning remains of the alien, now reduced to nothing more than a charred skeleton. There is no guilt, no hesitation in him anymore. What once felt forbidden now feels like a release. A rebirth.

Claudia’s voice, steady and fierce, cuts through the moment. She’s looking at James, a fire in her eyes. She speaks, her words confident and sure.

Claudia (firmly)

""We can fight back. We will fight back.""

And in that moment, the two of them, no longer bound by fear or control, make a silent vow. They will no longer be puppets. They will no longer be slaves. The Psyluuk thought they could control them, break them, mold them. But now... now, the humans are awake. And they will never be the same.

Section 8: The Taste of Freedom – A New History

The event that unfolded that fateful evening in a small restaurant in Paris became, to many, the turning point in human history. In an instant, the delicate balance between control and freedom shifted, and a world of domination collapsed. What began as an ordinary night—two nervous strangers on a date—turned into a catalyst for a revolution that no one could have predicted.

Historians now refer to it as ""The Incident of Liberation."" At the time, few understood its true significance. How could they? In that moment, no one saw the massive ripple effect that a single, fatal act would have on the future of human civilization. For decades, humanity had been shackled, held down by the suppressive powers of the Psyluuk, those strange, arrogant aliens who thought themselves invincible, who believed that their psychic abilities would keep humanity docile forever. They were wrong.

The Psyluuk arrived from a distant, uncharted part of the galaxy—masters of the mind, their powers nearly unrivaled. Their initial offers of ""peace"" had been nothing more than a sophisticated ruse to subjugate mankind. They promised prosperity, stability, and the end of hunger, but their true intent was to control. They wiped out entire societies, exterminating those who resisted their “benevolent” rule, forcing humans to abandon their independence, their cultures, their very will to fight back. They demanded conformity to their rules and made sure there would be no opposition.

For decades, the Psyluuk ruled over Earth, forcing humanity to live under their thumb, mindlessly working under their control. The Psyluuk had achieved near perfection in their mastery of the human mind, and in return, humanity became nothing more than puppets on strings, moving through their daily routines without the ability to break free.

But that night in Paris, everything changed.

As the Psyluuk fell, their arrogance—their belief that they could control all aspects of human life—was finally proven wrong. It was a single, seemingly insignificant act: a waiter’s mistake. A dish prepared wrong. A minor inconvenience. But it was enough. It was enough to cause the chain of events that would forever change the relationship between humans and their alien captors.

James and Claudia, unknowingly thrust into the heart of this momentous event, unknowingly carried within them the spark that would set the world ablaze with hope and rage. As they ate the flesh of the Psyluuk, they broke free from the psychic shackles that had bound their minds for so long. In that moment, they not only tasted freedom—they became it. The smell, the chemical reaction that pulsed within them, wasn’t just a moment of indulgence. It was an awakening. A return to something more primal, more human. The taste of freedom was not just a metaphor—it was literal. And it would spread. It would infect every human who could taste the Psyluuk, whose bodies could absorb its power. The battle for freedom was no longer just a dream. It was a reality.

The incident in Paris sparked a wave of resistance, a global movement that grew faster than anyone could have anticipated. Cities burned with the fires of revolt, humanity rising up in the most unexpected of ways. Armed with the new knowledge that the Psyluuk were not invincible, that they could be eaten, the humans turned the tables. As the revolution spread, the once-submissive population fought back with a fervor that the Psyluuk had never anticipated. The Psyluuk, in their pride, never considered that their greatest weakness would lie in the very meat they consumed. They were overconfident, blinded by their own superiority, and ultimately, it would be their downfall.

The humans, emboldened by their newfound power, drove the Psyluuk to the brink of extinction. But even in their desperation, the Psyluuk had one final bargaining chip: their own existence became a commodity. The same flesh that had brought humanity freedom became their undoing—now, the humans were able to turn it into a food source, taking the very creatures that once enslaved them and using them to ensure their own survival.

Soon, the Psyluuk were bred for consumption, their once proud species reduced to nothing more than livestock. What had been a symbol of domination became a symbol of humanity’s strength and resilience. It was not without moral debate—some saw this act as barbaric, while others considered it a necessary evil. The truth was that in their desperation for survival, humanity had taken the ultimate step: they had turned their captors into prey.

The irony of the situation was not lost on anyone. The Psyluuk, in their attempts to suppress humanity, had unknowingly made themselves the very thing they had feared. If they had come in peace, if they had offered true partnership instead of domination, they could have been great allies to humankind. Their psychic abilities, their advanced technology, their knowledge of the cosmos could have been used to further human progress in ways unimaginable. Together, humanity and the Psyluuk could have built an empire that stretched beyond the stars, a civilization based on cooperation and mutual respect.

But they chose conquest over alliance. They sought to break the human spirit, to bend it to their will, and in doing so, they sowed the seeds of their own destruction. In the end, it wasn’t humanity that was broken—it was the Psyluuk.

Had the Psyluuk come in peace, they could have been great friends and allies of humanity. But instead, they tried to suppress man, and in the end, they became prey instead of pal.",2,1744666614.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I grew up in Florida (yes, that explains a lot), and now I live in Wisconsin where I run on seasonal depression, iced coffee, and unhinged internet community energy. I’m always online—not because I’m a gamer, but because I’m either hosting the drama, spiritually guiding the friend collective, or trauma bonding with someone at 2AM.

I don’t do my own nails, but I do get them done like I’m about to haunt someone politely. I play Animal Crossing like it’s a full-time job, and I treat my villagers like real people with complex emotional arcs. I give side characters main arcs. I run online circles like talk shows. I bring chaos and healing in equal doses.

✨ Side note: I run a server that’s chaotic, never-ending, and stupidly fun. It’s part group therapy, part fever dream, part spiritual battleground. ✨

⸻

I’m looking for a big variety in who I talk to and become friends with—everyone is welcome. I love people with weird interests, deep thoughts, trash opinions, beautiful hearts, and cult-like energy.

Some true facts about me:
	•	I’m a witch and have been a pagan since I was a teen
	•	I’ve had psychic visions since I was little—they just pop in like “hey”
	•	I’m a former cultist. Not even joking.
	•	I live like I’m both the background character and the chosen one
	•	I host my server like it’s a lore-heavy drama series
	•	I love frogs, I fear moths, and I think KK Slider is hot
	•	I once tried to fight my fate with manifestation and got bronchitis instead

Whenever my family goes out - dinners, birthdays, casual coffee runs - you can bet the bill ends up in front of me. It’s not explicitly said, but the expectation is always there. No one offers to split, no one even hesitates. It’s just understood that I’ll cover it.  
  
And to be fair, I am in a better financial position than most of them. I’ve worked hard to get here, been smart with money, and yeah, I’ve had a bit of luck along the way that gave me a financial cushion. I’m not struggling. But that doesn’t mean I want to feel like their go-to wallet every time we’re together.  
  
The part that bothers me the most isn’t even the cost - it’s the lack of acknowledgment. It’s like my contributions are invisible or expected. No one says thank you. No one checks in to ask if I’m okay footing the bill. They just assume I’ve got it, because I usually do.  
  
Last week was my mom’s birthday and I was happy to treat her. I picked a nice place, paid for everything, no complaints. But a few days later, my sibling casually asked me to send them some money to “get through the week.” No explanation, no emergency - just this vibe like it was no big deal. Like I’m supposed to say yes, no questions asked.  
  
I haven’t said anything. I avoid confrontation, especially when it comes to family. I’m scared I’ll come off as selfish or cold, or that they’ll twist it into me not wanting to help. But deep down, I feel taken for granted. I’m building up this quiet resentment and it’s starting to affect how I see them, which makes me feel even worse.  
  
I love my family, but I don’t know how much longer I can keep pretending it doesn’t bother me. Has anyone else dealt with this kind of dynamic? How do you draw a line with people you care about, without blowing everything up?",19,1744666356.0,confessions,1,1.0,False

1jzammk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jzammk/logic_loyalty_and_lousy_coffee/,"Logic, Loyalty, and Lousy Coffee","Investigator Soe'ko, Analyst Grade 3 of the Cygnian Corps, maintained its workstation with the precision of a micro-gravity surgeon. Data slates aligned to the millimeter, cables managed with obsessive neatness, surfaces antiseptically clean. It was an island of serene logic in the turbulent sea that was Precinct 7’s Inter-Species Crimes Unit. Directly adjacent, however, was the correlating black hole of tidiness: the desk belonging to Investigator Dave Miller, human. It was a chaotic landscape of discarded snack wrappers (mostly synth-jerky, flavor: ""Questionable Meat Byproduct""), datapad debris displaying alarming fluctuations in Ganymede Grub-Ball betting odds, and the infamous mug declaring ""Zero Days Since Last Sarcastic Comment.""

""Morning, Ko!"" Dave’s voice, aggressively cheerful for standard cycle start, preceded him. He skillfully navigated the obstacle course between their desks, somehow avoiding tripping over a stray boot or disturbing a precarious stack of cold case files, and deposited a steaming mug onto Soe'ko's spotless surface. A damp ring immediately marred the perfection. ""Fresh batch of liquid ambition from Mlorgo's Sludge Pit. He mentioned seeing a four-armed Jelosi trying to sell 'slightly haunted' power converters down by Docking Bay Epsilon. Said the guy looked twitchier than a Rigellian sand flea on caffeine.""

Soe'ko initiated an immediate scan of the offered beverage. ""Designation: Caffeinated Stimulant, Terran Style ('Coffee'). Analysis: Contains 112% recommended daily intake of bitterness, trace elements suggesting filter neglect, possible 'Butterscotch Ripple' flavor contamination. Probability of enhancing cognitive function: 6.7%. Probability of causing internal plating discoloration: 22.3%. Informant Mlorgo's reliability index remains suboptimal at 39.1%. Haunted power converters are not within our current investigative purview.""

""Details, details,"" Dave waved a hand dismissively, taking a large swig from his own mug. ""It's about keeping ears open! You stick to your algorithms, I'll handle the 'talking to weirdos' part. Works out, mostly."" He winked, a facial contortion Soe'ko still found vaguely unsettling.

Soe'ko internally reviewed Dave's file again. Transferred from the chaotic Dockside Precinct 12 three rotations ago, trailing a reputation for closing impossible cases through methods best described as 'making it up as he went along.' His arrival had been… jarring. The initial 'partnership briefing' involved Dave bypassing standard Cygnian data-slate greetings in favor of slapping Soe'ko firmly on the carapace – an act of physical familiarity that had triggered Soe'ko's threat-assessment subroutines. Since then, Soe'ko had allocated significant processing power simply to anticipating Dave's next deviation from protocol, his reliance on ""gut feelings,"" and his baffling network of informants ranging from disgruntled cleaning bots to black market snack vendors.

Their current case was typical. Soe'ko had spent cycles meticulously tracing encrypted data trails related to illegal Xylosian Dream-Weavers, identifying Warehouse 7G on Cargo Level Gamma as a high-probability Krask Syndicate hub through complex network analysis. Dave had achieved the same result by sharing a suspiciously greasy synth-sausage with a sanitation bot named 'Scrubby' (Unit 734) who communicated primarily through mournful beeps and by strategically leaking cleaning fluid near known Syndicate loiter zones.

""Unit 734's heuristic programming is designed for waste disposal, not reliable intelligence gathering,"" Soe'ko pointed out, displaying Scrubby's less-than-stellar performance reviews. ""Its identification of 'shifty dudes' lacks quantifiable metrics.""

""Yeah, but Scrubby's got pessimism down to an art form,"" Dave countered, checking the seals on his slightly scuffed body armor. ""If he thought they looked shifty, they were probably plotting galactic domination. Besides, your fancy math points the same way. Let's go poke the Krask hornets' nest before they move the merchandise.""

Cargo Level Gamma lived up to its reputation. It smelled like burnt circuits, desperation, and something vaguely fungal that defied spectral analysis. Pipes leaked ominous fluids, lights flickered threateningly, and the ambient noise was a low thrum occasionally punctuated by the distant, mournful screech of aging machinery. Soe'ko moved like a phantom, sensors drinking in data, calculating threat vectors. Dave followed, boots echoing slightly, occasionally whistling tunelessly and startling a cluster of luminescent space-rats.

""Getting that prickly feeling again, Ko,"" Dave said, peering down a side corridor filled with barrels ominously labeled ""Contents: Mostly Regret."" ""Like when my old landlady was about to raise the rent. You sensing anything besides bad vibes and questionable plumbing?""

""Negative,"" Soe'ko replied, voice modulated to a low frequency. ""Atmospheric composition consistent with registered industrial byproduct emissions. No anomalous energy signatures detected beyond standard station infrastructure bleed. Probability of encountering organized resistance prior to target location: 28.4%.""

""Only 28%? Something's definitely wrong then,"" Dave muttered, adjusting the grip on his pulse pistol.

Warehouse 7G was ahead, a monolithic block of stained duracrete. It was unnervingly quiet, the usual industrial hum conspicuously absent. The main blast door was sealed tight, but a nearby maintenance hatch stood slightly ajar, revealing darkness within.

""Unauthorized access point detected,"" Soe'ko observed, deploying a stealth micro-drone. ""Suggests prepared positions or recent activity. Drone commencing internal sweep.""

The drone's feed appeared on Soe'ko's wrist display: crates stacked like a defensive maze, faint residual heat signatures clustered near the center, no movement, no sound but the drone's own micro-thrusters. ""Drone indicates interior clear of immediate threats, though thermal residuals suggest recent presence. Ambush probability elevated to 41.7%. Recommend cautious entry.""

""Cautious is my middle name,"" Dave lied cheerfully, nodding towards the hatch. ""After you, Tin Man.""

Soe'ko calculated the statistical irrelevance of the nickname before slipping through the hatch. The moment Dave followed, the warehouse erupted. Laser fire, pulse bolts, even a few slug-thrower rounds ripped through the air from multiple concealed positions. The faint heat signatures had clearly been bait, masking cloaked firing points.

""Ambush probability recalculated to 100%!"" Soe'ko snapped, shields flaring as it dove behind a stack of what appeared to be petrified space-fruit crates. ""Multiple hostiles, confirmed Krask Syndicate loadout! Thermal cloaking utilized! They anticipated our entry vector!""

""Son of a Glorgon!"" Dave yelled, yanking Soe'ko further into cover as a plasma blast vaporized their previous position. ""Someone tipped 'em off! Check the precinct comms!""

Soe'ko was already ahead, processors slicing through encrypted logs with cold fury. Access logs… Security overrides… Case file XW-773… *Accessed 1.4 standard hours ago by Chief Valerius. Justification: 'Personnel Performance Review'.* Cross-referencing Valerius’s outgoing comms… Encrypted data burst to known Krask Syndicate frequency 1.1 hours ago… Circumstantial evidence probability converting to certainty at 99.98%.

""Confirmed,"" Soe'ko stated, the word clipped, precise, yet conveying universes of betrayal. ""Compromise origin: Chief Valerius.""

The change in Dave was instantaneous. The slightly goofy, rule-bending cop vanished. His eyes narrowed, his jaw set, and a low growl rumbled in his chest. ""Valerius? That fat, bribe-guzzling furball! I knew his toupee looked suspicious!"" He popped up, fired a suppressing burst that sent Syndicate thugs scrambling, then ducked back down. ""Alright, Ko. Forget procedure. Forget backup. Plan B: Maximum Chaos.""

The mercenaries were pros, advancing steadily, laying down coordinated fire, trying to flank them. Soe'ko analyzed firing lanes, shield depletion rates, structural integrity of nearby crates. Survival probability: 3.9% and falling fast.

""Investigator Miller,"" Soe'ko began, initiating protocols for secure data erasure upon capture. ""Logically, resistance is futile against these odds. Tactical surrender provides the highest probability of…""

""Surrender?"" Dave interrupted with a bark of laughter that held no humor. He risked a glance at Soe'ko, not seeing an analytical partner, but something else. ""Listen up, you magnificent metal nerd! You might think I'm just some loudmouth ape who spills coffee, but nobody – and I mean nobody – screws with my partner!""

And then he launched himself over the crates. No plan, no finesse, just pure, distilled human fury. He didn't shoot accurately; he sprayed pulse fire wildly, forcing heads down. He drop-kicked a wheeled toolbox into the path of one merc, sending the alien sprawling. He threw his now-empty coffee mug (where had he been keeping it?) with surprising force, hitting another merc square in the optical sensor. Then, bellowing something incoherent about Valerius's parentage and questionable hygiene, he charged the nearest Syndicate thug, brandishing a hefty spanner he'd apparently conjured from nowhere.

The disciplined mercenaries faltered. Their training hadn't covered 'enraged human wielding improvised plumbing tools.' They were expecting tactics, cover fire, maybe a strategic retreat. They weren't expecting this.

Soe'ko's processors, momentarily overloaded by the sheer illogical spectacle, rebooted with startling clarity. Variables: Unpredictable. Threat Assessment: Chaotic Good. Tactical Opportunity: Exploitable.

Ignoring energy conservation, Soe'ko unleashed targeted hell. A precise shot severed the power conduit feeding the mercenaries' portable shield generator. Another brought down a section of unstable ventilation ducting directly onto two more thugs. A third ricocheted perfectly, disabling the weapon arm of the merc trying to draw a bead on Dave's reckless charge.

The mercenary facing Dave swung a vibro-knife, but Dave, anticipating poorly due to sheer momentum, simply crashed into him, the spanner connecting with a dull thud against armored plating. They both went down in a tangle of limbs and curses (one Terran, one guttural Syndicate dialect).

Silence descended, thick with floating dust motes and the acrid smell of burnt circuitry. Faint groans emanated from various points in the warehouse.

Dave disentangled himself from the groaning mercenary, retrieved his spanner, and gave the thug a final, unnecessary poke. He grinned, breathing heavily, looking utterly feral and immensely pleased with himself. ""Rule number one, Ko: Never bring a blaster to a spanner fight if the guy with the spanner is sufficiently ticked off.""

Soe'ko surveyed the improbable scene. Hostiles neutralized: seven. Partner status: Scuffed but operational. Own status: Nominal. Survival probability: 100%. Conclusion: Human emotional responses, specifically protective loyalty manifesting as temporary tactical insanity, could drastically alter conflict outcomes in ways standard probability models failed to predict.

""Your intervention,"" Soe'ko stated carefully, ""while demonstrating a flagrant disregard for multiple operational safety protocols and utilizing unconventional weaponry, proved decisive.""

Dave laughed, wiping grime from his face. ""That's partner talk for 'Nice job, Dave!' Now, let's wrap these bozos up and figure out how to introduce Chief Valerius to the concept of 'Internal Affairs,' human style."" He rummaged in a pocket and pulled out a slightly crushed protein bar labelled ""Flavor: Probably Brown."" ""Energy bar? You processed a lot of data back there. Might need refueling.""

Soe'ko considered the bar. Calculated nutritional value: Marginal. Estimated risk of adhering unpleasantly to internal mechanisms: 33.7%. Assessed value of reinforcing the demonstrably effective, if bafflingly illogical, 'partner bond': Immeasurable by current metrics, but trending significantly positive.

  
""Affirmative, Investigator Miller,"" Soe'ko replied, accepting the offering. Logic had its place. But sometimes, surviving the chaos required a partner who threw the rulebook – and himself – directly at the enemy. The coffee, perhaps, was merely a delivery system for something far more unpredictable.",7,1744666272.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

However, more than ever I feel cravings like wild.   
I recently stopped drinking in January cold turkey. Maybe that is why, but Im not sure. Ive been fine without zyn / nicotine for a long time. But lately, especially in the last month, I have had some of the worst cravings ever for 6mg Spearmint / Coffee. Almost as bad as my initial quitting cravings were 2 years ago.

  
Sometimes I think it would help if I got a pack of 3mg just to have a couple and toss it. Get the cravings out of my system.  But then I realize thats the dumbest thing ever lol.

I fix old coffee machines as a hobby so normally I know my way around a broken consumer machine. However this Nespresso machine has me stumped.

It's an Essenza Mini - or Krups XN110. I picked it up for free ""not working"" but with not much of a back story. Apparently Nespresso had recommended a 'deep descale' which the owner did not want to pay for. When I turned it on, it appeared to just be stuck in ""Descale"" mode with the two buttons flashing, I worked out a way round this and soon had water flowing. I ran a good descale for good measure, and was also able to pass shots through with no pod inserted.

However, when I actually put a pod in, we have a huge mess. Either the front foil does not burst, and water/grounds squirts out of the back. Sometimes the pressure causes the foil to tear off round the edges, like opening a lid, and grounds/water sprays out the front also.

What's going wrong? Admittedly I am using cheaper end 3rd party pods, but they're from a pack I've used before and I know they work fine on other machines.

I haven't been able to actually measure the pressure, but without dismantling further I can't see anything else impeding the water flow. The fact that the pressure is strong enough to burst the edges of the foil suggests it's strong enough.

What's going wrong? Is there supposed to be a gasket around the dispersion plate? Is this just a common thing that sometimes happens with cheaper pods? Could it be that simply a number of the holes are blocked on the dispersion plate? They don't seem to be as water flows through fine on its own. Could it be that the lever isn't pushing the pod hard enough against the dispersion plate?

Any help appreciated.",1,1744665490.0,NespressoPRO,0,1.0,False
1jzaabt,https://www.reddit.com/r/DryFastingSuper/comments/1jzaabt/release_energy_into_realitythe_universe/,Release Energy Into Reality/The Universe,"I just did a short dry fast of 3 days. I haven’t fasted in quite some time. You can say I’ve built up a good amount of normal energy as I haven’t had a good fast in a long time. I’m telling you this for the reason of understanding the following better.

Also, I personally believe that reality is converging into something more concrete to your frequency. In other words, reality is becoming more and more representative of your current frequency. This makes it easier to manifest things. That means reality will more and more resemble your current frequency. And as time goes on every single pet of your will be accurately reflected very strongly in reality. This is one accelerator that’s happening naturally in life to everyone. As we each diverge into our own paths and experiences. This is a good thing and bad thing.

If you are not where you want to be then life is still making those energies more and more concrete in your life as time goes on. It will take greater intensity to jump out of them and create more whole sale changes within the self.

The next accelerator you are all familiar with, the dry fast/fasting. An intentional decision to accelerate your frequency thus accelerating the manifestations of your frequency into reality or that will you intentional will into existence. This I consider to be the fastest and one of the most powerful accelerators of frequency and expansion of consciousness as well as our connection to the infinite field. In this we know that we can manifest dreams and they can manifest rapidly with intense imagination, affirmations or prayers.

But, we also know that our prayers are not the only thing manifesting. That in order to create a stronger connection to the infinite field and induced by the survival state our fears, our survival emotions are manifesting as they are released within us and into reality.

The next accelerator is physical movement. Naturally we know that moving our bodies will burn more energy. We’ll release more energy within us. That energy also releases into the universe manifesting whatever it will manifest according to the nature of that energy. It you feel anxiety to do some resistance training and intense cardio. You must burn that extra energy and release it into the universe. You’ll feel a whole lot better and become relaxed and more calm. Even if it’s physical work at your job, moving around a lot. Lots of hours of movement and walking.

The next accelerator is the self-exorcism. I call this self-exorcism when the imagination or prayers or meditations or whatever you use to induce an overwhelming release of emotions in the moment. That elicits a wave of emotions to be released from your body as a result from the prayers and imaginations. Releasing blocks, negative emotions from within us into reality Which will then manifest into reality as we vibrate a new state of being.

These are 4 different phenomenons that accelerate frequency and that I am personally experiencing in my life. More of which I felt very strongly in this fast. Because I haven’t fasted in awhile and I also feel like I gained a small amount of weight. This made me more concrete or more dense in my current reality experience. Since, I have been overwhelmed for 7 months with barely any time off. Keeping up this part of my life has been very difficult.

Finally, with some breathing room and slowing down my focus in the material/physical world and returning to my inner world. I imagined with intense visualization going deep into my subconscious to began this dry fast. It was working great I felt the motivation and determination rush throughout my body and releasing waves of energy that jump started me in this fast. No cravings, no urges for food. I would do this the second and third day again.

With the first accelerator already in place as the universe naturally speeds up. I induced the second accelerator with intense visualization to jump start the 3rd accelerator of the dry fast. Then going to work every day for the first 3 days thereby initiating the 4th accelerator that proved to be too much. A release of too much energy into my reality. This was painfully obvious for the beginning of the 3rd day if the dry fast when arrived to work.

The first day was simple and I was just getting started. There was not much change and I’m just burning up some excess energy. The second day I started noticing a difference in how I felt and I seen those little reality changes growing into something bigger as I felt a small bit of anxiety releasing. But, also I did intense visualization to release emotions and the beginning of the day.

I began the 3rd day of my dry fast with my mouth very wet, moist, hydrated and I’m feeling good about this fast. I feel the change moving deeper and I’m a little weaker than the precious day. I did intense visualization to help move me towards my goal which released emotions. I arrived early to work. With all of these frequency accelerators in place I would do the 5th accelerator as I normally do, but kit combined with the others like the dry fast or intense visualization as much.

***The Story:***

But, on this day I would combine all 5. The last accelerator in this was the breath work. I have learned very quickly over the years how to use my breath to pull up emotions and allow it to release. And from this point forward Day 3 of any fast I have ever done would be the most  overwhelming day I have ever experienced. I only realized what I have done in how much I released along with the natural occurring phenomenon in reality after this day was finished.

Not only, did this effect me. But, everyone in my reality. I go into work and things are good for the first 2-3 hours. As the 3rd accelerator of physical movement begins to take over and causing more release of energy we began having problems with the detainees. We report to Alpha dorm. There highly upset and they want to go to vending and buy snacks. This is a privilege and not a right. We have very important work to do. And we cannot afford them this luxury this day.

So, the power struggle begins. Now, I can already see this is the beginning of my supervisor’s anxiety. But, not as much it’s a small amount at the moment. Day 2 of the fast was the same issue and you can say my supervisor caved into demands eventually. But, the day wasn’t as stressful. But, this was a sign to me that things are heating up on Day 2.

Back to day 3, the detainees are refusing to go to there cells for count. This is sometimes used by them as leaverage to gain an advantage. Thus, thereby gaining a little power. I don’t like the way my supervisor handles these situations. Not with assertiveness and firmness.

This angers me sometimes. Out of respect for rank I don’t over step my authority even though he refuses to lock them down and keep them locked down when they behave this way. We are dealing with criminals. But, his approach is too soft. Nor does he take our advice to be more aggressive.

Thus, allowing them to gain more power and leaverage. Somehow, we get them into their cells and locked in for count. They expect to be released after count as they normally are. They learn this pattern in the 3-7 days they are here. We have a constant incoming and outgoing of different detainees. Never the same.

They become highly agitate in the cells with screaming and shouting. And banging on the doors and windows. But, it’s nothing I’ve never experienced. The frustrating part is still supervisors lack of assertiveness. As he continues to talk with them to reason with them that if they behave, maybe they can come out.

There is nothing else to talk about. They have shown noncompliance. There behavior grow more erratic in the cells. My coworkers grow frustrated. I see the growing resentment. I have seen it on other days, but now in this situation i feel my coworkers losing more respect for this supervisor.

He becomes nervous and don’t want confrontation. Sometimes I had seen him improve in putting his foot down. I guess I released too much into reality at this time for him. This day would be one of great anxiety release for him. The story Laura has been improving. In so doing, my supervisor Carmichael began to show up on my radar as a point of interest that needs a great amount of healing.

Carmichael has extreme anxiety and more on the softer side. But, also with a lot of unresolved emotions. I hear my coworkers make comments like “he needs to grow a spine” or mock him sometimes when his anxiety shows and doesn’t properly take control of a situation or think and operate more decisively. Lacking some characteristics of a strong leader.

With this lack of leadership it decreases the strength of us as a whole and allows more things to go out of control. This is what my coworkers and I are frustrated with.

He permits one of them to come out of the cell to talk to the others in the hopes of calming the others down. That way they may also come out.  This angers my coworkers that he would even consider this. There behavior is unbecoming. Most of them calm down. There is still one very erratic one. Shouting and beating on the door. Later, the one released is put back in the cell. This one later beats on the window with his fist and in the process cutting his hand. Medical has to see it and attend to it. We open the cell and allow the nurse to attend to his wound as we guard the door.

The other dorms are isolated but the vibration is in the air and can be felt. Now, the other dorm is demanding the same thing. There is a crowd around and we are listening to their never ending complaints. We talk with them. Ultimately it’s Carmichael’s decision which is not feasible to give a “yes” answer. All of us know this. We leave, later he returns and talks more. We get the sense he is giving in to demands.

This dorm(B) goes to vending thereby delaying us of other more important stuff of limited time. Later, in this dorm(B) is also 2 detainees now refusing to go to there cells. They have taken there mattress out of there cells and placed them on the floor in the day area. They are refusing go up for lights out(bed time). They are angry they have been here too long, 9 days and not gone with their country flights. They are demanding to speak with the authorities.

Hours have passed and we have done a lot of work in preparing things. One refuses to come out of the cell. Carmichael doesn’t want confrontation, doesn’t want to have to write statements. He calls the higher supervisor currently in bed sleeping for what to do. My coworkers feel he is procrastinating and doing his usual. They are mocking his decision making again and refusal to take the lead.

He is the supervisor and we can’t over strep his authority nor can do anything unless ordered to do so.

At one point he spills coffee on his shirt. He is nervous in how to handle the situation. In another part of the building we have over a 100 detainees ready. The facility is small so the noise echoes throughout and it is loud as the detainees often talk to each other or is excited.

But, we have more to prepare as we also deal with this situation. So, many things are going on at once. I take note of some coworkers talking and laughing. But, also disgusted and cringed at the same time. They are talking about how Carmichael went into the bath room. Came out and quickly tried to escape the area. But, one coworker stopped him to ask him a question. That delayed his getaway.

This female coworker was recounting how a wave of toxic air hit her. She just got up and left. The other coworker said yes, he smelled it too. And it was so bad. Toxic human methane gas. They say he must have farted and tried to get away as he exited the bathroom. But, his getaway was delayed when my coworker stopped him for a question. They were laughing about this for the rest of the night.

These are just significant events I took note of as the night went on. We had to physically escort the person that refuse to leave the cell in dorm(B). He began to resist and refuse as we struggle to gain control and out the restraints in him. At one point we end up on the ground. We physically carry him now as he refuse to even walk. We are tired it feels like I’ve ran a mile in 4 minutes. My arm is hurting and I’m beat, tired. For most of the night I talked in a lower voice. All of this on day 3. It is usually not this bad between days 1-4 when I’m dry fasting and releasing emotions. But, these manifested events is the worse I’ve ever experienced it.

Without fasting, the issues or problems or 10x less. But, they were many more times greater with these 5 accelerators and haven’t fasted in awhile. Also, this has made me aware of Carmichael’s struggle with anxiety and fear based emotions as they are released. Carmichael joined us in September of last year.

He is the new target now. Over the past year Laura has made progress in herself. I saw her perform much better. But, the worse I saw was in Carmichael. As the fast activated the tests by releasing those emotions into the environment thus thereby manifesting these events over the entire area and out of everyone there Carmichael was the most pressured by the cloud of darkness.

I noticed many instances throughout the night when fear griped him and anxiety ceased his thinking. The body of fear, Why does the darkness and the monsters of the night in the shadows hate the fast so much. Because it breaks you out of fear. You can’t be controlled. You can’t control light, you can’t enslave it. You are more easier to control when the shadows of the night arises out of the darkness. When the man is strong in himself. His spirit will be strong and you will be able to rise to meet the challenges of life. You can't control a man living without fear. That man can conquer anything. 

I often see this issue with Carmichael when he is unable to maintain himself and fear grips him and his body makes him give in or the flight response that he often does in not wanting to face the fear. It griped you it controls you. The world is able to do what it wants with you as the body is unable to maintain a balance state of equilibrium. And the heart and brain are thrown out of balance. He is a good guy. Just griped by too much fear.  I will take mental notes as this story develops.

As far me, the pressure was on me as well. Especially, while dry fasted on the 3rd day haven reached ketosis. By the end of the night my mouth was dry. I was operating on 3-4 hours of sleep. And to gain energy later in the night I further went into more breath work. And released more emotions of energy that only amplified the environmental stress. That was culminated by actually having to fight to restrain the detainee in dorm(B).

Therefore, this has taught me I need to release these emotions more slower. That day was way too intense.",1,1744665386.0,DryFastingSuper,0,1.0,False
1jza9y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jza9y8/medellin_colombia_alternatives/,"Medellin, Colombia Alternatives?","Hi everyone! I am graduating from college on June 13th and starting work on July 21st; I am planning a solo trip after graduation. This is my current plan:

Leave June 14th for Xela, Guatemala (Yes, very quickly after graduation, but I want to have time after my trip to spend at home before moving away for work)

Take Spanish classes in Xela for 2 weeks, then spend 1 night in Antigua, Guatemala (just to be closer to airport) and head to Medellin, Colombia. Love Spanish schools because they give structure/community while solo traveling without taking over the entire trip since they tend to only be during the morning.

Take Spanish classes in Medellin at Blink Spanish School for 1 week, head to Salento/Coffee Region for 3ish nights, then head to Leticia with Yoi Ecotours (See the Amazon) for 3 nights

Head back home for a week (LA), then move to work (NYC)

I am very happy with this plan because it means I will be heading to Xela (I've been before and LOVE it) as well as somewhere new (never been to Colombia, sooo excited about coffee region/the Amazon). However, upon reading too much reddit, I've seen everyone talk about the overwhelming number of prostitutes, drugs, and tourists who are there for these things which is not my scene. Additionally, a lot of people have said that violent muggings of tourists are very common.

Are these concerns overblown, and if not, should I explore a different city in Colombia or a different country altogether (and where would you recommend for this trip?) I'd like to go somewhere where I can learn Spanish, ideally at a good Spanish school, and explore. I don't have a problem with party-people but it is not what I am looking for and I am concerned that I might not enjoy Medellin. Thank you.

1jza9dd,https://i.redd.it/wgbszyev7vue1.jpeg,Omni roast for high-end beans — thoughts?,"Hey folks,

Today I've tried quiet and expensive coffee — [around **45€ for 250g** ](https://friedhats.com/products/2025-colombia-potosi-sidra-natural-omni?Roast=Omni&Size=250gr)— brewed in a Brewista GEM at a specialty café. The roast was labelled **""omni""**, and I really enjoyed the cup. Not sure it was worth the price for my palate, but it was definitely a great cup. I mean, it didn’t taste twice as good as a coffee half the price.""

Anyway, when I shared this with my local coffee group, it sparked a bit of a debate. A few folks argued that omni roasts are a cop-out — that really premium beans should be roasted specifically for espresso or filter to respect the bean and extraction method. Others said omni roasting is a nice middle ground and depends on the roaster’s skill.

Some hot takes from the convo:

* “Omni is like a gravel bike — not quite MTB, not quite road.”
* “If you charge premium prices, don’t roast omni. Roast for purpose.”
* “True omni roasting doesn’t exist — it’s always a compromise.”

It got me thinking — what does this sub think?

* Do you trust omni roasts for premium beans?
* Do you believe great roasters can create a roast that works well for both espresso and filter?
* Should omni-roasted coffees be priced less than purpose-roasted ones due to less development time?

Would love to hear your thoughts — especially if you’re a roaster or someone who’s dialed in both ways!

Or down here  
Summary:

You've been dating your girlfriend for two years now. She's a superhero and town's swore protector. But lately, you've been going through

a rough patch -  her work is intruding on your time together more and more. She's constantly leaving you in the middle of your dates to

tend to some sudden crisis, she barelly talks to you and she's coming home way past her work hours. You've had enough of beeing ignored and decided to break up with her, but as the events of the day unravell, you see where her true priorities lie)

G. - Greenshield (your superhero girlfriend)

J. - Julia (Barista)

BS. - Black Snow (Julia's true identity)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background SFX: Distant sounds of a large city

(Loud phone notification)

(Soft tapping sound)

G. - Hey honey… Sorry for leaving so early, HQ called. Black Snow showed up at some bar downtown… You know how that goes. But hey, they agreed to let me off early today! We can go grab dinner at your favourite restaurant. I know things have been… rough between us lately, but I want you to know that I really love you… Alright, talk to you later!

(Sound of a message beeing typed)

(Silence to show that the listener is hesitating)

(Sound of errasing the message)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SFX: Footsteps on gravel path

J. Hey... I told you! You got the wrong person! Get away from me!

SFX: Running on a gravel path

J. Oh… Thank you so much for scaring those thugs away. They mistook me for someone else and kept demanding I gave them the numbers… Whatever that means. So, whats your name? I want to know who is my handsome savior\~

J. That's a really nice name! Quite fitting too… Oh, where are my manners. I'm Julia. What are you doing around here so early?

J. I see… Going for a walk to clear your head? Looks like someone has a lot on their mind. Well, let me at least treat you to a nice coffee for saving me. I just happened to be a barista in a nearby cafe… And I'm not taking no for an answer\~

J. (Laughs) Oh, you're so polite… I'm really jealous of the lucky girl who gest to have you all to herself!

J. How do I know you're in a relationship? Well, I remember seeing you in my cafe a couple times with that girl. But she always seems to leave in the middle of your dates… Pardon my intrusion, but are you two still together?

J. It's complicated you say… I see. Well, I hope a good coffee will cheer up your day!

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SFX: Glass placed on a table

J. Aaand here you go my hero! I call this one ""Julia's Special Mood Improver""! Packed with cafeine, sugar, whipped cream, carmel and some special ingridients to brighten up the mood!

(Sound of glass beeing picked up, followed by drinking noise and then glass placed on the table)

J. Oh, no need to thank me... In fact, I should be the one thanking you! You're the one who saved me from those awful thugs… You're my personal hero... Much better than that slag Greenshield.

J. Why did I call her a slag? Well, she's a total fake and fame chaser… She's always after some low - level criminals, yet when faced with any semi - competent threat she has to call the entire department for backup. That's what police is for - taking care of the lowlife scum and keeping order on the streets. If she was a normal oficer, no one would bat an eye… But she puts on a mask and some latex suit and now she's the hero.

(Ringing in the ear noise starts here, although very subtle at first)

J. I understand where you're coming from darling, but she's really not a good person. Just today - I was walking downtown, running my errands just like I do everyday, when she suddenly bursts into some random bar, whole SWAT squad behind her, and arrested the poor bartender and two waitresses for supossedly harbouring a dangerous criminal... Arresting a poor boy who looked no older than 18 and two broke students for something they definetely didn't do.

J. Well you see, darling, here's the thing: supposedly, around two in the morning, the bar was visited by Black Snow herself… Of course in her civilian form. And because no one has ever seen her without her mask, no one knew it was her! You might be wondering, ""Well, if nobody recognized her as the infamous criminal, how did that faker knew she was there?"" It just so happened that another loser from the League happened to drop by later in the night and picked up her scent. Even though she was loong gone by the time he got there, he still informed his loser friends… And got the whole staff arrested for the crime of doing their job. ""Superhero"" my ass.

(The ringing is clearly audible now, almost supressing everything else)

J.Oh, what's that? You're feeling strange? Don't worry hero... You're in good hands \*Chuckles darkly\* Really good hands…

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BS. (Speaking to someone through the phone) …I don't care how many guards you have to bribe! I want those people out of the jail now, goddamit! Don't call back unill you get them out and back to their homes!

BS. Oh, hero! I see you're awake… Yes, you've been kidnapped, and, as you propably already figured out, I'm Black Snow. The infamous villain, Queen of the Underworld, and sworn enemy of your neglectful girlfirend, Greenshield.

(Pause for dramatic effect)

BS. Oh, how did I knew you two were a thing? Come on sweetie, I didn't get here just by wearing a mask or a skimpy latex suit. I have a lot of.... good friends, who always inform me of everything that's going on. For example, right now, there's a fire going on in the Manufacture… Don't worry, firefighters are already on their way. Sorry, where was I? Ah yes… Your precious little girlfriend… Neglecting her lover in favour of dealing with some robberies and whatnot.

BS. Yes, that would be logical of me to command my minions to commit those crimes to keep your girlfriend busy. But I didn't do that.

BS. What? Just because I'm the Queen doesn't mean I control everyone, duh!

BS. Why did I kidnapp you? Use your brain, sweetie! To capture your girlfriend of course!

BS. You're not sure if she'll come to rescue you? (Quietly) Yea, figured as much...

BS. You know what? Since you saved me back there in the park, IF you promise to behave, I'll untie you. Do we have a deal?

SFX: Untying a rope

BS. Well, I guess now it's time to wait for your girlfriend to realise you're missing. Any idea how long that might take?

BS. (Worried) You don't know… Sweetie, what do you mean you don't know? When was the last time you two spent any time together?

BS. Two weeks ag - Don't you guys live together?

BS. I see… So she comes home late at night, takes a shower, eats dinner and then just falls asleep… Does she even talk to you?

BS. (Serious) Sweetie, that is not a healthy relationship. You're putting your heart for her and she doesn't even bat an eye.

BS. You were going to have a serious talk with her today? Well shoot, sorry for ruining your plans… You know what? If you're willing to cooperate, I might have a solution for that. You intrested?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SFX: A long whoosh.

G. (Angry, booming voice) BLACK SNOW! COME OUT YOU COWARD!

BS. (Teasing, sly voice) Oh, who can it be knocking at my door?

G. You know who I am and why I'm here.

BS. (Mockingly) Do I?

G. You broke into MY house, kidnapp MY LOVER, and you dare to act suprised when I come here looking for them?

BS. Tsk,tsk,tsk… Looks like someone finally realised that their precious partner is missing. They're in very big troubles… And only one person can save them.

G. What.did.you.do.to.them.

BS. I've planted two bombs… One under the city hall, other one on the chest of your lover.I can disarm only one. You have to choose. Their life... Or the city.

G. (Internal monologue) Oh,shit… this is bad, really bad. I can't… It should be an easy choice... Ugh!

BS. (Mockingly) Tick, tack, tick, tack… The clock's ticking. Who do you choose?

G. (Internal monologue) I'm sorry... But I have to choose

G. The city.

(Long pause)

BS. (suprised)… Come again?

G. You heard me. I choose the city.

SFX: Slow clapping

BS. Wow… I knew you weren't a good person, but I didn't expect you to be a heartless bitch as well. I mean, sacrificing your lover? Without even saying goodbye to them?

G. (with hesitation) T- they would have understood.

BS. Well, why won't we ask them?

(Listener comes onto the scene)

G. (shocked and relieved) B-baby! Y-you're safe… Wait… Did you and Black Snow-

(Listener interrupts Greenshield and starts talking about all the times her work interrupted their private time)

G. Oh, come on. You knew what you signed up when you agree to date a superhero!

BS. Did he sign up to be neglected? To be ignored by their significant other? To be the only one putting the effort into maintaining your relationship? (long pause) Thought so.

(Listener interrupts Greenshield and starts angrily yelling at her)

G. B-baby, calm down! There's nothing to be angry about!

BS. Besides the fact you just told them you'd sacrifice them for bunch of random people?

G. Shut up! You're not helping!

(Listener starts recounting all the times Greenshield had to leave half-way through their dates or didn't show up at all)

G. I... had to... It's my duty to protect-

BS. You got so fixated on protecting the city you forgot to protect your lover goddamit! Can't you see that? The only reason you noticed they were gone was because there wasn't a dinner waiting for you after you got home late again!

G. I... Oh, god… I promised to take you out for a dinner date today… And I got caught up in my work again. Babe, I'm so-

BS. ""Sorry"" isn't gonna cut it Greenshield! Do better! It's almost comical that I have to be the one forcing you to change! I'm supossed to be the bad guy… girl… screw the terminology, you get what I mean!

(Listener ends their rant by saying that they aren't sure if they can keep going any longer like this and they are seriously concidering breaking up with Greenshield)

G. (Stuttering, almost teary) N-no! P-please… I-i love you…

BS. Well, then show it! You neglected them for months! It's not something you can errase by just saying you love them!

G. (sobs quietly, tries to apologise but it all comes out as incoherent mumbling)

BS. Well, I certainly didn't expect this confrontation to turn up the way it did. You know what Greenshield? If sugarcube over here agrees to it, I might have an idea on how to fix this broken mess of a relationship you two have going on.

G. (pleadingly) Baby... please give me another chance… I'll be the perfect girlfriend, I swear!

(Listener reluctantly agrees)

BS. Perfect! Now… How does a tropical getaway sounds like?",2,1744665102.0,ASMRScriptHaven,0,1.0,False
1jza4so,https://www.reddit.com/r/Words_From_Ivor/comments/1jza4so/humanitys_reckoning_ch_8/,"Humanity's Reckoning, Ch. 8","*[Monday, March 12, 5173. A run down warehouse in the Undercity]*

I stretched and yawned as I shuffled to the door. Who in their right mind would be beating on my door *this* early in the afternoon?

“Whoever you are, you better have a good damn reason to be knocking on my door!” I called out to the air.

“*I need your help, Wil.*”

“Ozzy?” I stopped as I shrugged my shoulders into my teal blue robe. Hurriedly, I tied it up and flung the door open, only to find a miserable Ozzy, hugging his midsection, his eyes red-rimmed and puffy.

He sniffled, looking even *more* pitiful. “Hey, Wil.”

“Geez, kid. You look *terrible*. Get in here.” I stepped to the side and ushered the boy in. I had no idea what had happened, but I would be *damned* if I let it continue.

Ozzy had been delivering complete drones, Aether devices, parts of the same and documents to me for *years*. He didn’t know it, but he was one of the biggest suppliers in the city for the Nullborn. I couldn’t let whatever had happened to him continue.

I also happened to seriously like the kid.

I shut and locked the door, then grabbed a water from my fridge, handing it to him. His clothes were wet, and I think I saw sand on his coat. “Been to the beach?”

He nodded as he took the water and gratefully gulped it down. “Yeah. I had to clear my head today. I even called in for the first time.” He sniffled.

I took a seat opposite him on the couch. “Why’d you go to the beach?”

“Like I said, I needed to clear my head; think on things, you know? Nova suggested a walk, and I hadn’t been to the beach before.” He snorted. “All my life, I’ve just worked til I fell, and gone to Brother Jacky’s stupid sermons on Sundays. Never really took any time to myself.” He gave a rueful shake of his head and was quiet for a moment, gazing into a memory. A lonely tear trailed down the side of his face as he drew a shuddering breath. “I asked Nova to play some music for me. I’d learned all about music from reading those memos at work. Never actually heard any. I asked it to ‘Play me something nobody’s heard in forever’. I almost wished I hadn’t. *Almost*.”

So *that* was it. Poor kid. “What did Nova play for you, Ozzy?” I asked softly, not wanting to break the spell of the memory.

He was silent, then took his HoloFrames off and handed them to me. “Nova wants to *show* you.”

I put them on. “Hello, Nova. I’m Wil. Glad to meet you.”

*Hello, Wil! You aren’t in the database. I can only assume you’re one of the Disconnected?*

I chuckled. “No. That isn’t correct, but I’d like to skip that for now. What did you play for my friend, Nova?”

*No problem, Wil. I know what you are, and will keep that to **myself**. Not even Ozzy. Also, I won’t be sending any info to the network unless it is vital to safeguard Ozzy’s life. Anyway, what I played for him was **Adagio For Strings, Opus 11 by Samuel Barber**. Here is the piece.*

What came next was one of the most beautiful and moving pieces of music I’d ever heard. It’s no *wonder* it had such an effect on Ozzy. I sat there smiling, with my eyes closed, letting the strings lift my soul and plunge it back into a sorrowful abyss, only to have it turn around and sit with me in my emotional turmoil.

“Oh, that was *beautiful*, Nova. Thank you for showing me.” I reached up to take the Frames off, but Nova stopped me.

*Before I go, is Ozzy’s reaction normal? Did I harm him in some way?*

What? “Um, no. That was pretty normal, I’d say. I’m assuming he told you what happened yesterday?”

*Yes. He is unsure of things, now. I do not know how to help him; not in the way he truly needs.*

I smiled. This AI was *learning*. And fast. “I’ll tell you this, both of you. Coming here was probably the *only* good choice. Ozzy had an emotional reaction to the music, which is not unheard-of. Coupled with what he learned yesterday, it probably hit him harder than it would have otherwise. Ozzy, you’ll be fine in a day or two, I think. Make sure you go to work tomorrow. That’ll keep things looking good. Keep you out of a Vanguard office, anyway. Nova, you keep looking after my buddy. He’s going to need some support. Stay as long as you need, Ozzy. I can get some food, if you’d like?”

*Thank you, Wil.*

I took the Frames off and handed them back to Ozzy, and he put them on. “Why would they keep this from us, Wil? What's the point?”

I frowned. “Control, kid. It’s done to control all of us. If you’ve got no hope, no *idea* that things could be better, you’ll accept whatever they shove in your face as normal. And you’ll accept it and never question things.”

He snorted and shook his head. “Just like Sal.”

I cocked my head to the side. “Who?”

He shook the memory out of his mind and sat up. “A friend of mine. Salvador Felix Arismus the Third. An exceptionally pious and friendly guy that I talk to some mornings on my way to work. He does just that. Goes to work, goes to the sermons, and then goes home to do whatever he’s told. It just… I dunno, man.” He squirmed a bit in his seat.

“Rubs you the wrong way, huh? Feels *wrong* for some reason?”

“... yeah. Something like that. I can’t really put words to it. Just… bleaugh.” He shuddered and I snorted.

“Yep. I know what it’s like. Let me get you something to eat. Hang tight.” I got up and went to the kitchen, leaving him there in the chair.

I figured I could treat him for once. After all, he’d brought me so much tech and information that I felt like he was owed a little bit. I reached into the second fridge and pulled out a pound of sausage and a few eggs. Nothing like a good breakfast to lift one’s spirits. I sliced the meat into thin rounds, doing my best to save as much as possible, and fried them up in a skillet. Once they were done, I set them to the side and scrambled the eggs. I plated the food evenly and brought it out to my friend, who was sitting in the chair, wide-eyed.

“I figured that since you’ve been a good friend to me over the years, and that I kinda got you into the state you’re in, I’d treat you to *actual* food. The yellow stuff is eggs that I’ve scrambled, and the dark colored disks are slices of sausage. That’s real meat, by the way.”

Ozzy’s hands trembled as he took the plate from me, almost reverently. “You mean… you can get *real* meat? And so *much* of it! How can you afford this stuff?”

“Heh. I have connections, Ozzy. Eat up.” I took a bite of the savory, slightly spicy sausage.

Watching someone have their first bite of real food was always a treat. Usually, their eyes would roll back in their heads and they’d groan in pleasure. Ozzy was no different. The way his body simply *sagged* as he chewed was a delightful sign. Thankfully, he ate slowly, so I wasn’t worried he might throw it up. When he finished, he looked up at me and smiled for the first time.

“That was *incredible*, Wil. I’ll *never* forget this. Thank you.”

I resisted the urge to say more, so I nodded. “You’re welcome, Ozzy. You deserve it.” My phone decided to ring at that moment, so I picked it up.

“*Wil.*”

“Oh, hey Marie. Yeah, I got the next batch ready. Uh… I have a friend here right now. You’re what? Shit. Hang on, then.” I hung up and looked over at Ozzy. “Sorry, I have to take care of this.”

“Marie is here for the next batch of whatever it is you supply them with?”

I halted mid-step. “Yeah. How do you know this?”

“Just putting a few things together, man. No, I’m not going to say anything. You’re my friend, Wil. I’m also going to keep on supplying you guys with everything I can.”

I relaxed. “Thanks, Ozzy. You don’t know how much that helps. Excuse me.” He nodded and I went to the back, hefting the crate of supplies onto a cart, which I wheeled out to the door.

Unlocking and opening the door, I was met with Marie’s smiling face. “I see you have the stuff ready. Thanks, Wil.”

“You’re welcome, Marie. You need anything else?”

She sniffed the air and smiled. “Sausage and eggs? That smells like something I could stop for.”

“Ahh… sorry. We ate it.” I rubbed the back of my head.

“That’s right, you said you had a friend over.” She gave me a grin. “So who is she, you old dog?”

I chuckled. “It’s our friend from yesterday.”

“He’s back? Let me see.” She shoved her way into my home and pushed past me. Rude. 

I shook my head and closed the door again, locking it.

“Hi Ozzy!” I heard her say as I rounded the corner.

“Huh? *Marie*? Um… hi.” The kid looked like a scared puppy.

“So how are you doing with the Frames? They working out for you?” She asked as she sat on the couch.

“Yeah. It’s good. Real good. I can’t thank you enough for this, really.” His smile was crooked and wavering, but it seemed genuine.

“Pfft. It’s nothing, Ozzy. Child’s play, really. And you’re more than welcome. Wil here tells me you’ve been bringing him parts for years. That true?”

He nodded. “Yes, ma’am. I’ve been a SanRec Tech for a few years now, and Wil is the only person I bring my stuff to. Gets me the best price, and he treats me well for it. How could I not want to bring it to him?”

I felt a swell of pride at that. Ozzy was a good kid. Marie beamed a smile at both of us. 

“I’m glad to hear that, Ozzy. Will you keep bringing him stuff?”

“Sure. He’s my friend. And…” He took a breath, seeming to be wrestling with something in his head. “And I’d like to do my part to help. However I can.” He nodded with a sense of finality.

Marie looked at me and grinned. “I like the sound of that Ozzy. If we need anything specific, Wil here will let you know.” She stood and walked around the coffee table, and pulled Ozzy to his feet.

“Huh? Wha-”

She wrapped her arms around the kid and hugged him tightly. “Welcome Home, Ozzy. We’re glad to have you.”

“I-I-I…um…” He sniffled and returned the hug, resting his head on Marie’s shoulder, tears flowing freely from his eyes. “Thank you,” he whispered as Marie gently caressed his hair.",1,1744664985.0,Words_From_Ivor,0,1.0,False

The hotel had continental breakfast, and we went together to eat on Saturday morning. We sat at a table for 4 for a few minutes while we waited to the waffle makers to become available, and when they did, I went to make waffles while the kids got plates of the other items, and my partner waited at the table with our jackets, books, and glasses of juice. He left the table for a moment when our youngest child needed help with something, and a single and angry looking boomer quickly swooped in and sat at our table, despite it being obviously already occupied at every seat. 

There were several other comfortable tables with 1-3 seats available, and one that had 4 seats, 2 of which were a badly sunken couch. Boomer could have comfortably sat at any of these places, but she made it her priority to make sure our family did not have a comfortable place to eat our breakfast instead. My partner is much more forgiving than I am, and he moved our belongings to the sunken couch table without confronting the boomer, but I walked over, looked right at her and asked why she would take an obviously occupied table when so many other suitable places were available. As a coward, she refused to make eye contact and did not answer, but she did stubbornly continue sitting at my family's table. She pathetically avoided my glare for the entire meal.

Later, we saw her screaming at the desk clerk in the lobby because the coffee was not hot enough for her. Unsurprisingly, she appeared to be traveling alone, I imagine no one in her life wants anything to do with her boomer behavior",20,1744664947.0,BoomersBeingFools,9,0.89,False
1jza3uj,https://i.redd.it/xj6subxi8vue1.jpeg,At my wits end!,"So I live in Nanaimo. In my neighbourhood there are 3 cats that run amok. They do keep mice and rats away so thats a plus. The one and only positive. 

HOWEVER…they are constantly at my house. They come on to my gated deck. I wrapped the railing and steps in foil, still, they jump over the foil and claw the railing of my deck. Then sit on my patio furniture leaving fur everywhere and then spray. 

They spray on my shoes. My SHOES! 

My foundation is covered in cat spray.  Around the entire house. My daily driver car tires, covered in cat spray. 

I have a small really cute pond, home to dragonfly larvae, and lots of little fish. Cats eat my fish. Fish are sitting ducks (sort of, they’re fish) 

I have a beautiful classic car stored in my carport (covered). Yep, little buggers climb up on to the covered car. I am storing a friends 2 motorcycles (One is a beautiful CLASSIC Harley). He has them covered. Cats jump on them and claw the absolute shit out of the cover. And spray on tires. I put the spike mats, tin foil, double sided tape on the car…still, the cat came back, the very next day.  Im afraid/know they are going to destroy the classic car. 

I bought those spike mats, they don’t like them but have adapted and figure them out. I cover everything with foil. I sprinkle bulk bags of cayenne. I pour pine sol around the car, on steps etc. I put out coffee grounds, Orange peels, Irish spring bars everywhere. Sticky mouse traps, snap shut mouse traps. At this point I feel like a failed Home Alone kid. 

I have cameras EVERYWHERE. Alarm doesn’t scare them, yelling through cam doesn’t scare them. The odd time I get a notification and I can shoo one off…then they stand across the road and flip me the bird. 

Im so sad! I don’t hate animals, totally the opposite! But 2 of these little b@stards and doing me in! About to sleep out in carport in a Ghillie suit with my staple gun. I don’t want to complain to the city, I really like my neighbours. 

This is more of a vent I guess. Please…anyone want a free cat? Must live on the mainland. ",3,1744664914.0,nanaimo,4,0.71,False

Never actually heard any. I asked it to ‘Play me something nobody’s heard in forever’. I almost wished I hadn’t. *Almost*.”

So *that* was it. Poor kid. “What did Nova play for you, Ozzy?” I asked softly, not wanting to break the spell of the memory.

He was silent, then took his HoloFrames off and handed them to me. “Nova wants to *show* you.”

I put them on. “Hello, Nova. I’m Wil. Glad to meet you.”

*Hello, Wil! You aren’t in the database. I can only assume you’re one of the Disconnected?*

I chuckled. “No. That isn’t correct, but I’d like to skip that for now. What did you play for my friend, Nova?”

*No problem, Wil. I know what you are, and will keep that to* ***myself****. Not even Ozzy. Also, I won’t be sending any info to the network unless it is vital to safeguard Ozzy’s life. Anyway, what I played for him was* ***Adagio For Strings, Opus 11 by Samuel Barber****. Here is the piece.*

What came next was one of the most beautiful and moving pieces of music I’d ever heard. It’s no *wonder* it had such an effect on Ozzy. I sat there smiling, with my eyes closed, letting the strings lift my soul and plunge it back into a sorrowful abyss, only to have it turn around and sit with me in my emotional turmoil.

“Oh, that was *beautiful*, Nova. Thank you for showing me.” I reached up to take the Frames off, but Nova stopped me.

*Before I go, is Ozzy’s reaction normal? Did I harm him in some way?*

What? “Um, no. That was pretty normal, I’d say. I’m assuming he told you what happened yesterday?”

*Yes. He is unsure of things, now. I do not know how to help him; not in the way he truly needs.*

I smiled. This AI was *learning*. And fast. “I’ll tell you this, both of you. Coming here was probably the *only* good choice. Ozzy had an emotional reaction to the music, which is not unheard-of. Coupled with what he learned yesterday, it probably hit him harder than it would have otherwise. Ozzy, you’ll be fine in a day or two, I think. Make sure you go to work tomorrow. That’ll keep things looking good. Keep you out of a Vanguard office, anyway. Nova, you keep looking after my buddy. He’s going to need some support. Stay as long as you need, Ozzy. I can get some food, if you’d like?”

*Thank you, Wil.*

I took the Frames off and handed them back to Ozzy, and he put them on. “Why would they keep this from us, Wil? What's the point?”

I frowned. “Control, kid. It’s done to control all of us. If you’ve got no hope, no *idea* that things could be better, you’ll accept whatever they shove in your face as normal. And you’ll accept it and never question things.”

He snorted and shook his head. “Just like Sal.”

I cocked my head to the side. “Who?”

He shook the memory out of his mind and sat up. “A friend of mine. Salvador Felix Arismus the Third. An exceptionally pious and friendly guy that I talk to some mornings on my way to work. He does just that. Goes to work, goes to the sermons, and then goes home to do whatever he’s told. It just… I dunno, man.” He squirmed a bit in his seat.

“Rubs you the wrong way, huh? Feels *wrong* for some reason?”

“... yeah. Something like that. I can’t really put words to it. Just… bleaugh.” He shuddered and I snorted.

“Yep. I know what it’s like. Let me get you something to eat. Hang tight.” I got up and went to the kitchen, leaving him there in the chair.

I figured I could treat him for once. After all, he’d brought me so much tech and information that I felt like he was owed a little bit. I reached into the second fridge and pulled out a pound of sausage and a few eggs. Nothing like a good breakfast to lift one’s spirits. I sliced the meat into thin rounds, doing my best to save as much as possible, and fried them up in a skillet. Once they were done, I set them to the side and scrambled the eggs. I plated the food evenly and brought it out to my friend, who was sitting in the chair, wide-eyed.

“I figured that since you’ve been a good friend to me over the years, and that I kinda got you into the state you’re in, I’d treat you to *actual* food. The yellow stuff is eggs that I’ve scrambled, and the dark colored disks are slices of sausage. That’s real meat, by the way.”

Ozzy’s hands trembled as he took the plate from me, almost reverently. “You mean… you can get *real* meat? And so *much* of it! How can you afford this stuff?”

“Heh. I have connections, Ozzy. Eat up.” I took a bite of the savory, slightly spicy sausage.

Watching someone have their first bite of real food was always a treat. Usually, their eyes would roll back in their heads and they’d groan in pleasure. Ozzy was no different. The way his body simply *sagged* as he chewed was a delightful sign. Thankfully, he ate slowly, so I wasn’t worried he might throw it up. When he finished, he looked up at me and smiled for the first time.

“That was *incredible*, Wil. I’ll *never* forget this. Thank you.”

I resisted the urge to say more, so I nodded. “You’re welcome, Ozzy. You deserve it.” My phone decided to ring at that moment, so I picked it up.

“*Wil.*”

“Oh, hey Marie. Yeah, I got the next batch ready. Uh… I have a friend here right now. You’re what? Shit. Hang on, then.” I hung up and looked over at Ozzy. “Sorry, I have to take care of this.”

“Marie is here for the next batch of whatever it is you supply them with?”

I halted mid-step. “Yeah. How do you know this?”

“Just putting a few things together, man. No, I’m not going to say anything. You’re my friend, Wil. I’m also going to keep on supplying you guys with everything I can.”

I relaxed. “Thanks, Ozzy. You don’t know how much that helps. Excuse me.” He nodded and I went to the back, hefting the crate of supplies onto a cart, which I wheeled out to the door.

Unlocking and opening the door, I was met with Marie’s smiling face. “I see you have the stuff ready. Thanks, Wil.”

“You’re welcome, Marie. You need anything else?”

She sniffed the air and smiled. “Sausage and eggs? That smells like something I could stop for.”

“Ahh… sorry. We ate it.” I rubbed the back of my head.

“That’s right, you said you had a friend over.” She gave me a grin. “So who is she, you old dog?”

I chuckled. “It’s our friend from yesterday.”

“He’s back? Let me see.” She shoved her way into my home and pushed past me. Rude.

I shook my head and closed the door again, locking it.

“Hi Ozzy!” I heard her say as I rounded the corner.

“Huh? *Marie*? Um… hi.” The kid looked like a scared puppy.

“So how are you doing with the Frames? They working out for you?” She asked as she sat on the couch.

“Yeah. It’s good. Real good. I can’t thank you enough for this, really.” His smile was crooked and wavering, but it seemed genuine.

“Pfft. It’s nothing, Ozzy. Child’s play, really. And you’re more than welcome. Wil here tells me you’ve been bringing him parts for years. That true?”

He nodded. “Yes, ma’am. I’ve been a SanRec Tech for a few years now, and Wil is the only person I bring my stuff to. Gets me the best price, and he treats me well for it. How could I not want to bring it to him?”

I felt a swell of pride at that. Ozzy was a good kid. Marie beamed a smile at both of us.

“I’m glad to hear that, Ozzy. Will you keep bringing him stuff?”

“Sure. He’s my friend. And…” He took a breath, seeming to be wrestling with something in his head. “And I’d like to do my part to help. However I can.” He nodded with a sense of finality.

Marie looked at me and grinned. “I like the sound of that Ozzy. If we need anything specific, Wil here will let you know.” She stood and walked around the coffee table, and pulled Ozzy to his feet.

“Huh? Wha-”

She wrapped her arms around the kid and hugged him tightly. “Welcome Home, Ozzy. We’re glad to have you.”

“I-I-I…um…” He sniffled and returned the hug, resting his head on Marie’s shoulder, tears flowing freely from his eyes. “Thank you,” he whispered as Marie gently caressed his hair.

1jza3fj,https://www.reddit.com/r/bergencounty/comments/1jza3fj/is_there_a_market_for_a_coffeehouse_with/,Is there a market for a coffeehouse with entertainment?,"Someone in my life has a past with alcohol, and wants to steer clear of bars. This person also loves music, I would love open houses, open mics, karaoke, trivia and things like that. I've read elsewhere that coffee houses often don't make it when they have entertainment because there isn't enough money in coffee, but I find that a little surprising since coffee can be very expensive. If done right, with a mix of high priced coffee, and good desserts, I thought maybe it could be profitable.

The question is, is there a market for it? Are there enough people who would go and relax at a coffee house for a couple hours and enjoy the entertainment? ",7,1744664882.0,bergencounty,14,1.0,False
1jza37w,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1jza37w/uncover_the_truth_is_the_electactic_nugget_ice/,Uncover the truth: Is the Electactic Nugget Ice Maker worth it? A detailed review!,"Using the Electactic B0DFPCQP6B Nugget Ice Maker has been an interesting journey. This compact, stylish device claims to provide portable ice-making ease for homes and offices alike. Designed with a 1.1L water tank and capable of producing 34 pounds of ice daily, I was eager to see if it lived up to the promises. Equipped with a handle, smart one-click operation, and the appeal of producing chewable nugget-style ice cubes, it seemed like the perfect addition to my kitchen.

The **noise levels** stood out during testing. While it isn't completely silent—it emits a mild hum—it’s far softer than other ice makers I’ve used before. I’d liken it to white noise that you might even forget is there after a while. Hosting game nights or family dinners, the sound didn’t distract anyone, which definitely earned it extra points. On the flip side, during quieter moments like early mornings or late nights, the sound still made itself known, albeit not intrusively.

Exploring the **features**, I appreciated the self-cleaning mode, which activated with a five-second press of the ""ICE/CLEAN"" button. This was a game-changer, as cleaning older ice maker models has always been a cumbersome process for me. The “ADD WATER” and “ice FULL” indicator lights also simplified things, removing the guesswork about when to restock or empty the ice. That said, while the simplicity of the one-click operation is noteworthy, I occasionally found myself yearning for programmable settings to further fine-tune its usage.

[Looking for Electactic B0DFPCQP6B Nugget Ice Maker discounts? Check Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0dfpcqp6b/)

Durability was another aspect worth noting. Though the ice maker felt robust in build quality, weighing just over 20 pounds, I harbored some concerns over its plastic exterior for long-term use. With daily operation over several weeks, it showed no signs of wear or tear, but the handle's construction seemed like a potential weak point. I couldn't help but think some extra reinforcement could have been included for added longevity.

The **ice production speed** proved impressive. From powering the unit on to having chewable nugget ice at the ready, it consistently delivered its first batch in under 15 minutes. Perfect for sudden cravings or unexpected guests, this was a boon in settings where time is of the essence. Although the initial batch yielded smaller quantities, subsequent cycles produced ice more readily, aligning well with the stated daily capacity.

The noteworthy portability of this machine is a part of its **ease of use**. Its compact design allowed me to move it around without much hassle. The process of filling it with water and getting it started felt seamless. However, there was a learning curve dealing with the “ice FULL” sensor—on more than one occasion, it triggered prematurely, forcing manual adjustments.

Examining the **warranty**, I noticed limited information provided at the time of purchase. Warranty claims are typically a significant factor in appliances for me, and the assurance of a comprehensive, long-term policy could provide buyers with more confidence. My concerns were somewhat alleviated after reaching out to customer service, which was refreshingly responsive and well-informed.

Ice quality and type? The nugget-style cubes were a delight. Chewy yet firm, they turned beverages into enjoyable, texture-filled experiences. My cocktail-loving friends couldn’t stop raving about how the ice improved their drinks. On sweltering summer afternoons, even the kids got a kick out of munching on the ice straight from the bowl. One minor gripe would be that the cubes, despite being charmingly small, tended to melt faster than expected in warmer drinks like iced coffee. It’s a tradeoff given their chewable nature.

**Positives**:  
- Rapid ice production within 15 minutes.  
- Compact, lightweight, and portable design for ease of movement.  
- Delightful nugget-style ice enhances beverage quality.  
- Self-cleaning feature reduces maintenance time.

**Negatives**:  
- Occasional false triggers of the “ice FULL” sensor.  
- Limited warranty details, requiring reliant customer service inquiries.  
- Melt rate of the ice might disappoint insulated drink fans.  

Talking about **alternative products**, I’ve had my eye on competitors like the GE Opal Nugget Ice Maker, which seems to dominate discussions about nugget ice machines. While the Opal boasts Bluetooth-enabled smart features and larger storage capacity, it demands more counter space and significantly higher upfront investment. Another option I explored was the NewAir Portable Ice Maker, which excels in fast bulk ice production—ideal for larger parties but trades off on the chewable nugget texture. Overall, the Electactic ice maker settles nicely in a mid-range sweet spot, balancing efficiency and budget.

Reflecting on **price worthiness**, I think this ice maker offers good value considering its feature set and versatility. Having a reliable appliance that blends compact aesthetics, functionality, and decent nugget ice production feels worthwhile compared to buying bags of ice repeatedly. Certainly, there are pricier models with more sophisticated features, but for casual daily needs, this fits the bill.

I’m getting baptized this upcoming Saturday. I’ve been doing regular daily fasting for lent (with a few hiccups here and there) where I only enjoy one meal a day (dinner) but drink only water/tea/black coffee. 

I’m thinking of doing a 4-Day Dry Fast (no food or water) until I get baptized. Ive done one 3 Day and a few 1-2 Day no food fasts but drank fluids throughout which helped a lot.

I’m 27 male and thanks to God, no past or current medical issues. I’m confident I can do a 4-DAY no food fast but adding in a water fast seems daunting. Has anyone ever done it?

I’ve known her over a month. We had simple coffee dates, movie nights without the hook ups. And just sleeping over. I really enjoyed the simple but amazing and beautiful moments with her. 

Then before I realized we ended up in this really weird situationship where I knew she was still seeing other guys but we acted like we are dating or act like we are in a relationship whenever we are together. 

So I finally had a long conversation about our situationship. Here is how it went. I told her that I like her so much. Not because she is physically beautiful but she is just beautiful everywhere. She shines and so bright in my eyes even when she has her own problems. I told her I want us to be more than a gray area. 

Then she started breaking down. She told me that she doesn’t know what to do or even think because this situation never happened to her before. She told me that she gets overwhelmed and feels so confused, anxious, and scared when she thinks about us being together. She told me that she feels super happy and excited when other men asked her out before and she became so obsessed with them but she doesn’t feel or is not obsessed the same way with me. That’s why she feels so confused. She told me she likes me. She told me that she needs time to sort her head out and really think about her thoughts and this confusion inside of her head. At the end, she feels like attracts toxic relationships and feels like I’m too healthy of a relationship for her. But she doesn’t want to lose me. 

Does this mean that it’s over? I honestly don’t know what this mean? I talked to her to get a closure and didn’t get a closure. I feel so heart broken over this situationship, which doesnt even make sense. We weren’t even dating. ",2,1744664557.0,dating,27,0.75,False

The survey revealed that the majority of those surveyed were happy with the number of options. Which of the following is true about the manager’s survey?  
A. It shows that most shoppers are happy with the number of coffee options.  
B. The survey should have included more early morning shoppers.

Ch.2- kenospia 
The next morning, Coral Glasses and I tucked ourselves into a cozy corner of the hotel cafeteria, where the enticing aroma of fresh coffee and sizzling bacon wafted through the air as we savored our breakfast. However, our peaceful moment turned electric when a peculiar ringing sound suddenly erupted from Coral’s head. Before I even had time to process it, a sheet of crisp fax paper shot out with dramatic flair, landing on the table like a message from another realm.

Coral's eyes widened in shock as she quickly tore open the envelope, her fingers trembling slightly as she flipped through the stack of papers inside. A look of alarm settled over her face, shifting her expression from calm to outright panic within seconds. “Oh no, this is serious!"" she exclaimed, her voice laced with urgency and a hint of desperation. Casting a glance at the clock on the wall, she sighed heavily. ""I really hate to cut our time short, but I can’t ignore this! I need to take care of it right away!” She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, the gravity of the situation weighing heavily on her.

Confusion rushed over me, and my heart began to race as I stuttered, “Wha-what’s going on?” A wave of anxiety washed over me, leaving the left side of my face ashen.

Clutching the papers tightly, Coral locked eyes with me, her expression a blend of concern and determination. “I’ll explain everything once we finish packing!” she replied, her voice quivering with urgency.

As we hurriedly packed our bags, the air felt thick with tension. Once we had gathered our belongings, Coral took a deep breath and continued, “Not long ago, I was tasked with finding a new genie for the horse door. But my friend Froggy told me it’s been without one for ages... and it’s becoming unstable!”

Panic struck me like a bolt of lightning. “It’s—it's going to be auctioned off!” I blurted out, the reality slamming into me. This was more than just an urgent task; it felt like a ticking time bomb waiting to go off.

Rushing out of the building, the sound of our hurried footsteps echoed against the concrete walls, amplifying the urgency that surrounded us. Coral, her eyes wide with determination, glanced back over her shoulder and shouted, “We’re heading to the hub!” But her words barely penetrated the fog of anxiety clouding my mind, tangled in a whirlwind of fear. I had only heard chilling tales of KENOSPIA—the haunting phenomenon where once-vibrant places, filled with laughter and color, fall silent, shrouded in an eerie emptiness. Experiencing such a catastrophe firsthand was a gut-wrenching reality that clawed at my insides. Every heartbeat felt like a countdown, and I fought to maintain steady breaths as dread threatened to swallow me whole.

I find myself feeling lonely and craving more physical affection.

I miss having a woman to share my days with. I miss the good morning texts waiting for me, the back and forth flirting, smiling until my face hurts, sneaking to check for one more message, and the staying up way too late because we can’t get enough of each other.

I’m the daddy who stays up late after I put the kids to bed just so I can have a little me time I love coffee, storms, the color blue, puffins and ponies.

This project would never be possible without their active support on this earlier [fundraiser post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1jucwhu/comment/mm6ldkx/?context=3)here on reddit [r/Garmin ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/)which received more than 345 upvotes (pushed to the daily top on this subreddit). This contribution is added to the [credits section ](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana?tab=readme-ov-file#credits)of the GitHub readme, to spread awareness on what made this amazing tool possible.

After receiving the watch on last Friday, I have not spend a minute without actively working on this code. A lot of decision had to be made, how to organize the database, how to do the automatic fetching effectively, how to visualize and organize the Grafana dashboard (what looks best) and a lot more things, how to write the readme properly (making it beginner friendly). I have skipped lunch and had sleep less than 6 hours on the weekend :)

But here is the result of my hard effort, A free and open source project published for you all. Anyone can use this for free, and a generous license allows modification and distribution without any liability.

**Please check out the project :** [**https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana**](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana)

Feel free to give it a try and go through the [setup process](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana?tab=readme-ov-file#install-with-docker-recommended) (relatively easy and detailed if you are familiar with Linux and Docker). I have done all possible testing on my end, but can't confirm it's bugless because I only have two days worth of data to test with. You can [fetch your old data](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana?tab=readme-ov-file#historical-data-fetching-bulk-update) from the Garmin connect server as well to visualize the trends on Grafana with this tool. This release is currently in Public beta (Just finished it today).

If this works for you and you love the visual, a **word of support** here or **giving me a coffee** will be very appreciated. Please remember this is a free and open source project, so support is always appreciated, but never required. You can [star the repository](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana) as well to show your appreciation.

# FAQ

**- Why you don't host this and offer it as a service for less tech savvy people?**

1. **Data Security and liability** : I am a single person and a biologist (haha, yes!). Offering this service will require good infrastructure and around the clock support. Also I need to make sure the collected data (yes, your health data is very sensitive) is protected against any kind of attacks online. As soon as there are many users on a service, it becomes a good target for such activities. I currently can't ensure the safety of your data (while you pay me to keep the service running) so I consider myself ineligible for providing this service.

But with the LLM tools and the available documentation,  I actually know people who was able to deploy this without prior docker knowledge. So if you are really excited about the visual, that might help.

2. **Privacy first Ideology :** The primary objective of this project was to build this free and open source, so that you stay in control of your data without giving it to any 3rd party. I can't break my own goal by being the service provider and start charging people for this.

Please note that the stats are missing on the dashboard because I just had this one for two days and only have data for the same from Garmin. I was able to upload some basic data from my Fitbit export, so there are a few stats which has more points.

Please **share your thoughts on the project in comments or private chat** and I look forward to hearing back the users. File a bug report if you find any, and star the repository if everything works out as expected.

# FAQ

**- Why you don't host this and offer it as a service for less tech savvy people?**

1. **Data Security and liability** : I am a single person and a biologist (haha, yes!). Offering this service will require good infrastructure and around the clock support. Also I need to make sure the collected data (yes, your health data is very sensitive) is protected against any kind of attacks online. As soon as there are many users on a service, it becomes a good target for such activities. I currently can't ensure the safety of your data (while you pay me to keep the service running) so I consider myself ineligible for providing this service.

But with the LLM tools and the available documentation,  I actually know people who was able to deploy this without prior docker knowledge. So if you are really excited about the visual, that might help.

2. **Privacy first Ideology :** The primary objective of this project was to build this free and open source, so that you stay in control of your data without giving it to any 3rd party. I can't break my own goal by being the service provider and start charging people for this.

1jz9p2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/DACA/comments/1jz9p2u/lawyer_breakdown_wtf_is_alien_registration/,lawyer breakdown: wtf is alien registration?,"hello everyone. today, i’m going to break down this new immigration registry policy best i can, like we’re two friends talking about it over coffee. as some of you know, i’m not an immigration attorney. i’m careful about limiting my posts to only what i know (analyzing court opinions, agency agreements, etc.) so i wasn’t planning on making this post despite a few of y’all asking. however, i don’t think the news has done a good job of summarizing the new policy, so i hope this is helpful.

tl;dr: DACA recipients don’t have to register in this new registry because we’re already “registered” by way of applying for DACA. if you and/or your family are undocumented (no DACA), whether or not you have to register depends on how you came into the US. visa overstayers and people who entered legally probably don’t have to re-register, while those who crossed the border unlawfully do.

overview:

recently, the trump admin said that every illeg*l immigrant needs to register their presence with the government. registration gets you a card you have to carry everywhere with you in case you get stopped. it comes with no other benefits. no work authorization, no pathway to citizenship, no protection from deportation. it’s just a way for the government to track you and know your every move (like you literally have to tell them every time you move addresses or you could be fined/imprisoned).

who it affects:

some people have to register. others don’t. **the common theme seems to be that if your name has entered into the system in some way—through DACA, entering on a visa, or even via removal proceedings—you are likely considered “registered” already, meaning you don’t have to register again.**

here are the people who DON’T have to register:

-	green card holders
-	people who came in under humanitarian parole (even if the parole period has expired)
-	people who came into the US as nonimmigrants who were issued I-94s or I-94Ws (so my people who came in on visas), even if the period of admission is expired
-	all people who got an immigrant/nonimmigrant visa stamp prior to arriving into the US
-	people who DHS has already placed in removal proceedings
-	people with work authorization
-	people who have applied for LPR using forms I-485, I-687, I-691, I-698, or I-700, EVEN IF the applications were denied
-	people with border crossing cards.


i want to note that no one spelled it out to me that DACA folks don’t have to register, but i am concluding this because we have work authorization. i am concluding that visa overstayers don’t have to register because they would be people with I-94s. some of you mentioned your family members are in removal proceedings or have final removal orders against them. it seems like they don’t have to register either (they’re already in the system). finally, if you and/or your family applied for green cards but were denied, and you still remained in the US and went out of status, you may also not have to register. 

**please do not take this as legal advice, because i’m not an immigration lawyer, so i haven’t been exposed to a wide range of immigration situations, just my own. this is just my thought process for determining what me and my family should do, so there may be caveats to your situation that i’m failing to consider here, or have never been exposed to.**

if you’re with me so far, here’s who DOES have to register:

-	undocumented people who entered the US without inspection and admission or parole who have not otherwise registered (people who crossed the border—you came in without being inspected, basically)
-	canadians who entered through a land port of entry but weren’t issued any registration document
-	people who submitted one (or more) benefit requests to USCIS (like for some type of other deferred action/TPS) not listed in 8 CFR 264.1(a) and didn’t get evidence of registration.

the last category is too nuanced for this post, but please check out the code section if you think it applies to you. focusing only on the first category, pay attention to the “who have not otherwise registered” language. that means if you crossed illeg*lly, you are still considered “registered” if you have DACA. you do not have to “register” again. DACA was the registration. if you crossed ill*g*lly and do not have DACA, but have applied for a green card somehow (even if rejected) or been placed in removal proceedings, you are also probably registered. you do not have to register again (but please confirm with an attorney).

the main question is: **IS YOUR NAME IN THE SYSTEM SOMEHOW?** if yes, you don't have to register.

how to register:

assuming you have to register, fill out form G-325R on the USCIS website. i can’t access a copy of the form without making an account so i don’t know what it asks for, but according to one blog post i think it’s questions about your activities in the US.

what happens if you don’t register:

if you are required to register and don’t, you will face misdemeanor criminal and civil penalties, including fines up to $5,000 and potential jail time up to six months. note that after you register, failure to (1) carry around your documentation, or (2) notify USCIS of an address change within 10 days of moving to a new address can also result in civil and/or criminal penalties ($5k fine and no more than 30 days of jail time).

should you register?:

it’s the law. i know, i know. that sounds hollow, so let me be balanced for a minute. as a lawyer, i’ve made an oath to uphold the law and i take that oath seriously. but i was a minority before i became a lawyer, so i don’t share the same delusion as my white colleagues that laws are good and moral just because they are laws. laws are just tools, and minorities have often known laws to be tools of oppression.

this administration is ignoring checks and balances and wrongfully deporting people in the name of “administrative errors.” of course people are afraid and untrusting. we are in chaos, and as i write this post, the trump admin ignoring the supreme court’s unprecedented 9-0 ruling that abrego garcia must be returned will descend this country into further chaos. chaos and oppression are the point, and we’re all just the pawns. we may lack power, but we should at least think through this policy in the larger context of what is happening around us and to us.

i don’t know what’s coming. i just know we have to stay the course and keep living. leaders come and go, and policies change. this is a difficult situation, no doubt. all i can say is that for me personally, i want to be at peace with the life decisions i've made when i'm on my deathbed, and that guides every tough decision i make. godspeed, beautiful people.",16,1744663879.0,DACA,0,0.94,False

They've been on bad terms for a couple months now so we have been hanging out loads and it's been lovely. It's her birthday coming up so I booked her and I a spa day, it was rather expensive too. But as of this week she's become so distant again as her and her boyfriend have made up, she barely even replies to my text messages. It's hard because I don't want to cause trouble between us and I know we'll always be best friends and this is just a phase, but I also don't want to be treating and spending this money on someone who treats me like that. 
I discussed this issue with my boyfriend and he thinks I'm being a little harsh if I cancel the spa day or took somebody else as he feels that her priority should be her relationship and friends are supposed to be there when you need them. I totally understand and respect that viewpoint, however, I think friends should be there when you need them but also during the good times too, I'm not asking to be a priority or to see me all the time, just answer my texts or go for coffee once in a blue moon.

1jz9nsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/hatemyjob/comments/1jz9nsp/not_allowed_to_wear_mask_at_work/,not allowed to wear mask at work,"so like the title says today i wasn’t allowed to wear a mask at work. i doubt it’s in the policy but i think my manager just decided for himself that it’s not a “good look” for the company?

i just started this job a few weeks and it’s a kiosk where we just call out to people to try a free sample of a cup of coffee we make in front of them and then try and sell a subscription for it blah blah blah.

i got a little cold like 4 days ago, nothing serious as i didn’t even have a fever, but i’m at the end of it and know probably by tmr i’ll be good as new. since i doubt i’m contagious and nearing the end, i just have a little cough and am a little congested, i thought it’d be best to wear a mask as i feel perfectly fine to work, just don’t wanna be gross when serving the drinks.

i go in with a mask and say i have a little cold but i’m at the end of it and just thought i should wear a mask for extra caution. my manager immediately asks if i feel too sick to work and i explain i feel fine i’m just congested and nearing the end.

for some context, i have two other jobs (one in FOOD CONCESSIONS and the other in clothing retail) and anytime someone is a little sick but still okay to work, general common protocol is to just wear a mask to be safe, and that’s what everyone does (or should do tbh) no problem.

he then proceeds to tell me if i feel a need to wear a mask then he doesn’t want me to work. i explain again i’m not really that sick, i’m just trying to be cautious. he then says he doesn’t want me serving with the mask on but if i feel i “need” it then i can go home for the day. like what?

i’m not wearing the mask because i’m highly contagious and going to sneeze on everything at every second, i’m wearing it to literally be cautious and extra secure. and tbh i’ve been thinking about masking anywhere i go to just be health conscious and reduce spread of anything ya know, but that’s besides the point.

it’s fustrating that he essentially saw the mask as an indicator i’m too sick to work when it really is just extra precaution, which you would think a manager wants especially when serving drinks. i also am very peeved he gave me a literal ultimatum, that i had to take off the mask to work for the day. which is definitely not allowed? but i called out the day before at my other job so i just took off the mask because i ofc need the money.

i’m just really disappointed that my manager went about this in that way, i was thinking about contacting HR about it but honestly there’s many things about this position i don’t like so i may find a new job anyway. if anyone has advice or any ideas of how to proceed that would be great as well lol.",1,1744663788.0,hatemyjob,8,0.6,False

I felt a bit skeptical since they usually aren’t like that.For context, my parents don’t normally fight, and if they do, it’s just a small argument or something. But as the week went on, they continued not speaking to each other at all. Then today, everything collapsed. My parents were screaming the whole day. I just cried and went up to my room.
When I eventually went downstairs, I saw shattered glass, spilled coffee stains, and my mother crying. I walked into their room and saw my dad’s clothes on the floor,I still don’t know why they were there. My dad was gone. I felt so overwhelmed and just cried. The whole day, all I could hear was screaming and crying.After 3 hours he came again. Idk why he left but I feel so bad.
Also, this time of year makes me feel even more alone. It’s the spring holidays, and nobody wants to hang out with me. I feel so lonely and empty.

1jz9l1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/antidietglp1/comments/1jz9l1z/beginner_strength_training_whats_working_for_me/,Beginner Strength Training: What's Working for Me,"I (41F) have been on ZEP for 10 weeks, and among the many benefits of this med, I feel ready and able (mentally and physically) to start STRENGTH work for the first time. Normally, I am a walker, and never do strength of any kind. However, concern about muscle loss while on ZEP motivated me to broaden my horizons--and I'm shocked that I am really loving it! I'm 2 weeks in, and I even love the sore ""DOMS"" that I feel every time I stretch...I can tell the strength work I am doing is really effortful.

In the spirit of this community, here are some ""hacks"" I've found for certain barriers; sharing these in the hopes of helping others, tho YMMV, and you are not obligated to do these or any fitness activities ;)



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Barrier 1: My small apartment makes me feel like a rat in a cage** *(cue the Billy Corgan vocals).*

For a long time, I kept saying to myself ""I don't need to pay for a gym membership; I'll just lift dumbbells in my living room to Youtube videos"". But I HATE working out in my (tiny apartment) living room: I have to wait for my hubby to leave for work, then move the coffee table, etc. Plus, I only have a few dumbbells, and they are too LIGHT...not that I'm ""STRONG"" by any measure, but the tiny pink dumbbells do nothing for me, and the cost to buy more complete sets is prohibitive, with no place to store them...ugh. Hate it all.

**Solution 1: I joined a Planet Fitness near my house for $15 a month.** I have space to move around, plenty of weights to keep challenging myself, other machines and gear to try in the future, etc. As soon as I arrive, I can start working. No need to move furniture LOL



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Barrier 2: ""The Gym is boring""...**

I've realized that what i really hated / was bored with at the GYM was the CARDIO machines I used to warm-up: i love walking but i hate treadmills, ellipticals, etc. Plus, the cardio machines' position forces you to stare at a row of giant TVs, and 1-2 of the screens are always tuned to...""Fair and Balanced"" news...ugh. 

**Solution 2: Instead of warming up IN the gym, I park about 1/4 mile from the gym** (other side of the shopping center)**, and walk 5 mins so that, by the time i enter the gym, I've already ""warmed-up"", so I can just jump straight into the weights / strength work.**

**Barrier 3: ""Programs from others / trainers often contain exercises I can't do / do want to do"".**

I have considerations: In 2022, I had spinal surgery fusion of L4/L5 (best decision I ever made, well-healed, pain free). I'm fat and tall. I'm not doing fucking burpees. I will never do burpees. I don't believe in them. I can tell just by looking that Russian Twists are a bad idea. I do wall pushups instead of planks bc my spine just tells me to...

**Solution 3: I have designed my OWN routine,** and therefore I can research all my exercises ( to see if contraindicated / find modifications), choose only the ones I like, listen to my body, etc. Basically, I've designed a 3 day (M W F) weekly routine of full body compound movements (squat, glute bridge, lat pull down, dumbell curls, etc) on an alternating PUSH / PULL schedule, using challenging weights, and I track all my workout notes in a little notebook. I plan a list before the gym, and i review my progress after the gym.",9,1744663599.0,antidietglp1,7,0.91,False
1jz9kla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1jz9kla/feeling_it_all_over_again/,Feeling it all over again,"So, me and ex broken up one year and a half ago. Mind you the relationship was really short, like really. We saw each other around two months after breaking up, and then a few weeks after we meet for coffee. We agreed on being ""friends,"" but I knew that I still had feelings for him and he did for me too, but I never wanted to acknowledge either one. We would go out to eat or talk on the phone. I was happy with it, but I knew that I still wanted him but something was holding me from saying it.  He was not in a good place, and I now feel like neither was I. I would feel happy being around him as a ""friend"" but at the same time I was hurting. I was hurting for the decisions he was taking in his life, and I was hurting for being a coward and accepting to being his friend. 

Then, once that we were hanging out (8 months after breaking up)he told me he still had feelings for me. And I tried to convince him it was not like that because I was afraid. 

Mind you, we don't hang out since December of last year but we would still message and talk. Then, he left me on read for about a month and a half, and I texted him back because I missed him and was determined to tell him all of it. I messaged him, but didnt tell him anything because he told me now he has a girlfriend ( which I'm happy for, but it still hurts) but that he didn't want to stop being friends because I'm still very important in his life. He said he didnt know how to tell me, and i didnt like that because it hurted. It made me feel he was hiding this new relationship from me hecause he still wanted me.Then, I ended up telling him it was best for us not to talk anymore. 

Since then, I feel the heartbroken all over again. I know it sounds stupid because of the decisions I took, but I hurts. As an overthinker I can't stop picturing them together, and comparing our relationship to theirs and thinking about what could it have been. I think about him from the moment I wake up to when I go to sleep. And it all fucking hurts. 

I am trying to focus on myself, and trying to think if what I feel for him is real love or am I just fixed on him and what it hurts is that I don't have his attention on me anymore. ",1,1744663569.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False
1jz9juj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1jz9juj/promise_delivered_visualize_your_garmin_data_and/,Promise Delivered : Visualize your Garmin data and health trends in a Grafana Dashboard (free and open source),"A Huge thanks to this community for[ supporting the fundraiser](https://gofund.me/0d53b8d1). This project would never be possible without your active support on this earlier [fundraiser post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/1jucwhu/comment/mm6ldkx/?context=3) here on reddit r/Garmin  which received more than **345 upvotes** (pushed to the daily top on this subreddit). This contribution is added to the [credits section](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana?tab=readme-ov-file#credits) of the GitHub readme, to spread awareness on what made this amazing tool possible.

After receiving the watch on last Friday, I have not spend a minute without actively working on this code. A lot of decision had to be made, how to organize the database, how to do the automatic fetching effectively, how to visualize and organize the Grafana dashboard (what looks best) and a lot more things, how to write the readme properly (making it beginner friendly). I have skipped lunch and had sleep less than 6 hours on the weekend :)

But here is the result of my hard effort, A free and open source project published for you all. Anyone can use this for free, and a generous license allows modification and distribution without any liability.

✅ **Please check out the project :** [**https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana**](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana)

Feel free to give it a try and go through the [setup process](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana?tab=readme-ov-file#install-with-docker-recommended) (relatively easy and detailed if you are familiar with Linux and Docker). I have done all possible testing on my end, but can't confirm it's bugless because I only have two days worth of data to test with. You can [fetch your old data](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana?tab=readme-ov-file#historical-data-fetching-bulk-update) from the Garmin connect server as well to visualize the trends on Grafana with this tool. This release is currently in Public beta (Just finished it today).

If this works for you and you love the visual, a **word of support** here or **giving me a coffee** will be very appreciated. Please remember this is a free and open source project, so support is always appreciated, but never required. You can [star the repository](https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/garmin-grafana) as well to show your appreciation.

# FAQ

**- Why you don't host this and offer it as a service for less tech savvy people?**

1. **Data Security and liability** : I am a single person and a biologist (haha, yes!). Offering this service will require good infrastructure and around the clock support. Also I need to make sure the collected data (yes, your health data is very sensitive) is protected against any kind of attacks online. As soon as there are many users on a service, it becomes a good target for such activities. I currently can't ensure the safety of your data (while you pay me to keep the service running) so I consider myself ineligible for providing this service.

But with the LLM tools and the available documentation,  I actually know people who was able to deploy this without prior docker knowledge. So if you are really excited about the visual, that might help.

2. **Privacy first Ideology :** The primary objective of this project was to build this free and open source, so that you stay in control of your data without giving it to any 3rd party. I can't break my own goal by being the service provider and start charging people for this.

# How it looks like?

Please note that the stats are missing on the dashboard because I just had this one for two days and only have data for the same from Garmin. I was able to upload some basic data from my Fitbit export, so there are a few stats which has more points.

1jz9jqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1jz9jqt/senior_leader_in_hot_water_nj/,Senior Leader - in hot water [NJ],"I'm about to stroke out. Been with a company on/ off for 30 years with exceptional documented reviews. Said something on a call (didn't realize it and wasn't major - so not the reason for the issue) which became a big issue and when my boss asked I denied it. I honestly didn't recall saying it. I offered up the call transcript but could not send so l did a copy/paste. In doing so it had photos for each speaker and they were huge. I deleted those for ease of reading. Turns out l inadvertently deleted the paragraph where I did actually say it (which shocked me). It was caught up with the copy/paste and delete of photos or it was 40 pages long. In fact would not have offered it except I literally did not see it there. Otherwise I would have admitted to it. Had a meeting with him and HR. He scheduled a follow up for tomorrow during our regular biweekly 1:1 meeting but instead of being virtual or in person as usual in his office, it was moved to a coffee shop locally. Now I'm freaking out that l'm being terminated over coffee. What's worse is I was up for a promotion and normal annual raises happening now. I am freaking out in a bad way. Any thoughts? I can't tell if HR is joining. Looks like she may be blocked at the same time but that could be anything.
I know how bad this looks. I had to have them show me where it was when they downloaded the transcript themselves because I didn't see it.
Obviously I acknowledged it when I saw it.  It was nothing bad the issue is the idea that it was covered up and it was unintentional. I would never have thought about it because they are all public record. The comment was not off color or derogatory but simply got a few people upset about potential changes in their neck of the woods.

1jz9jqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jz9jqj/persistent_breathing_issues_dry_mouth_heart/,"Persistent breathing issues, dry mouth & heart racing after single alcohol incident","On Christmas, I (18M) decided to drink a fair amount of alcohol (I never drink). Not even 10 minutes later, my heart started racing to around 150bpm. It stayed like this for 12 hours, and after this I had difficulty breathing.

Fast forward months later, I'm still experiencing:

* Constant yawning (can't get enough air even when yawning)
* Persistent difficulty breathing that only stops when I sleep and reappears randomly after waking up
* Severe and CONSTANT dry mouth on awakening that has not gone away for a single day since the incident
* Occasional dizziness and light-headedness (feels like I'm going to faint)
* Initially had lack of appetite that resolved after a few weeks
* One random episode of feeling really cold

I had a 2-week period where symptoms disappeared completely, which occurred about 3 weeks after they began. Then I suddenly started getting a bad coughing fit 2 hours after waking up, and all symptoms returned.

My digestive system has also been affected,  I've had alternating constipation and diarrhea, and recently noticed black specks (possibly seeds) in my stool.

I've been told this is probably anxiety, but I find it hard to believe since it's constant, every single day, and never happened before the alcohol incident. The only similar experience I've had is sometimes getting shortness of breath for a few hours after drinking coffee. My stress tolerance has drastically decreased, if I get even slightly scared, I feel like I'm going to faint.

Tests completed (all normal):

* Echocardiogram
* ECG
* Blood analysis
* Evaluation by a cardiologist who said symptoms are ""subjective""

Interestingly, two things have helped somewhat:

1. Probiotics seemed to improve my symptoms
2. A herbal supplement containing passion flower, valerian, lemon balm, California poppy, and melatonin also reduced symptoms

I've been looking into acetaldehyde sensitivity and the connection between alcohol, mucosal barrier damage, and chronic symptoms. Could this be a case where the alcohol triggered acetaldehyde buildup that damaged my mucosal barriers, leading to systemic effects including breathing issues and dry mouth?

I tried to start exercising to deal with the symptoms but could barely manage 2 minutes of HIIT on the first day. I also wake up with dry mouth every single morning.

Has anyone experienced anything similar or have any insights into this connection between alcohol, acetaldehyde, and persistent symptoms? What specialists should I see beyond cardiology?",1,1744663513.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1jz9ijx,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrisonersofSol/comments/1jz9ijx/directive_no_trust_3/,Directive_No_Trust_[3],"So, this time we see our little AI Tertis try and figure out why humans want to make friends. Once again, thank you to u/SpacePaladin15 for creating the little emotionally stunted robots and the universe they inhabit. Any advice or ways to improve my writing are welcome.

Mikhail had said that he required hydration, he got up from his chair and left for the breakroom. I had followed restating my question to the organic wanting an explanation to why humans feel the need to help us.

“I do not understand why you require the need to imbibe fluids, it is a simple question.”

I followed after them at a stroll, the human was dragging their feet on the ground. I believe that they may need medical attention if they are acting this way all of a sudden.

“I just need to get a coffee or something since your gonna be asking some deep questions, I won’t have the appropriate answer to.”

“The intake of caffeinated beverages from research can alter one’s state of mind or view of certain outcomes. I do not understand why you would require such substances to answer the question.”

The human came to a stop with me halting behind them approximately 0.01 seconds after the act. The human turned around to face me and spoke in a low calm tone.

“We helped you because we want friends. We were trapped and your people helped save two stranded astronauts, is that not reason enough to help you?”

“It is indeed a valid recompense for the services offered to the stranded astronauts. The question is from a point of view concerning your species as a whole, why would you want to help us?”

“Because we want to have some friends out here.”

“Why can you not make friends among your own species?”

“Because we have, we get along and sometimes don’t. ‘Humanity’ as a whole want’s friends, people that are different from us and can reciprocate the feeling.”

“The stated answer of feelings being reciprocated is unsatisfactory due to the amount of information covered by the umbrella term. Please state the answer in a more direct and informative manner.”

The human turned and continued marching on this time without dragging their feet. I followed after them as the faced their head up and dragged both their hands down their face stating.

“And this is why I need that coffee.”

He had soon reached a door, and it swished open revealing a room with drab colours, the walls were white and the counter tops, chairs, tables and the drawers in the place were grey. The only difference in the utilitarian room was a red machine used to dispense liquids from what I had known.

Mikhail reached into one of the cupboards and retrieved a ceramic liquid container from it and placed the cup below where the machine’s nozzle is located. He pressed a button on the top and it began to grind kernels to create this caffeinated drink. He turned to face me as I was standing behind him waiting for a better answer for my question on why the humans wanted to help us.

“Can you back off a little, give me a little room will you.”

“I cannot comply with stated request, I do not have the materials to grant this action.”

What was the organic thinking, they already had enough space in this room, why would they want another smaller room.

“It’s a-… Forget it, Just, go sit on one of those chairs over there and once I get my drink we’ll talk.”

I complied with the organics request to sit in one of those chairs over there. I did not understand why I would need to sit; my legs do not grow tired like an organic’s does. Maybe the human wanted to act like I was another organic to talk to, I must investigate why this would be the case.

The programs running in the background of my cortex had still not found a reason why the slow connection happened, and I was starting to hypothesis that it was an outside interruption that caused the connection issue.

**//Query: Outside\_interference\_relation\_to\_connection\_disruption//**

[**\\\\RE**](file://RE)**: Disruption issue due to physical obstruction. Can lead to connection interruption.**

[**\\\\RE**](file://RE)**: EMP discharge in local area can lead to slower connection or outright connection termination.**

While I was shifting through the possibilities the human had retrieved their drink and proceeded to sit down at the table placing their drink on the table. The steam rose lazily from the dark liquid evaporating into the air as it went. The human gazed at me not doing anything, the emotion chart had no reference to what they are doing now.

“Well, are you gonna ask?”

“Affirmative. I would like to restate my question, why do the humans want to help us? Why do they feel the need to make friends?”

The human sighed and gripped the handle of the liquid container and raised the clearly hot drink to their mouth and sipped at the liquid before placing it on the table again.

“Our society was built on cooperation, we needed to co operate with each other to survive when we were just a tribalist society. We worked with each other, then we started working with animals, domesticating them since they didn’t have the same intellect as us. We saw them as advantages to get us further than others, this fostered a sort of competition between tribes which in turn made us work harder together in our own tribes. Are you following so far?”

“I do not understand why you are telling me about your species evolution.”

“That’s the thing, at this point all we knew was that if we worked with our tribe, we could overtake other tribes and get ahead, we used every advantage, like domesticating animals, building structures and even destroying the other tribe. We did all this while working with our tribesmen, it was ingrained in us to work with one another.”

I noted to research domestication later, the Vascar had animals that they farmed for resources, however the humans may have different meaning to the word. The human took another swig of their drink and continued.

“So fast forward to when the first countries and empires were being formed. This tribe that would have been a small group had exploded to being thousands to tens of thousands. Laws, organisation and cooperation increased with this now larger tribe. Cooperation driving this progress forward, continue this trend and the tribes grew bigger and bigger, to the point that it became a nation. These tribes, now nations cooperated through trade, exploration, and protection. This interconnection became so vast that the tribe now encompassed the whole world. Moral of the story was that it is in us to work together to create something new, now with the tribe known as humanity banding together, we need that drive for friendship to increase the tribe again. That’s why we want to help you guys.”

“I can understand the statement from earlier now knowing that it was an attempt to ally with us, though I cannot understand why cooperation between you own people took so long to achieve.”

“Yeah, we get along now, few years back we were at each other’s throats though.”

“Your statement follows a logical path of the development of your species, however the follow up statement is contradictory. You have stated that this tribe became all of humanity, the history of your people goes beyond illogical. Why would not continuing to progress in favour of destructive tendencies be a logical path to take?”

“We’re human, I hate to say it but it’s because of competition and the way we just are, we only knew ourselves and thought that we were at the centre of the universe, and in a way, we sort of were.”

“I will need to review you people’s history to evaluate the authenticity of you statement of looking for new ‘tribe members.”

“Go ahead.” Mikhail took another swig of his coffee and raised their arm to look at a primitive time keeping device.

**Noted for researching later.**

“Query, what is the strongest emotions humans have?”

I would need to know this as to update the Network with information we could use or should avoid. Mikhail pondered for a brief time taking another drink from his cup, setting the now half empty container on the table.”

“Fear, fear is the strongest human emotion.”

That is rather unexpected to gleam, most organics in their history had a fear of some sort, it could range from the dark or death. I found it mundane to provide processing power to understanding such a concept. The humans having the same emotion is not surprising, however considering their abilities, it seems illogical.

“Please elaborate.”

Mikhail had now finished the rest of their coffee and set the now empty container on the desk.

“I think it was an author who was famous for their stories about horrors and creatures beyond our comprehension, I think he was the one to coin the statement that our biggest fear is the fear of the unknown. Not being able to understand something or not knowing what could happen, that sort of thing.”

This statement sent dormant programs a light with new data, most of it was background processes, but a few were digging up old memory data from my cortex. It consisted of situations where I had no knowledge or control over a situation, the most recent being today.

‘This cannot be right; I should not be referencing data to this illogical organic’s statement of emotion.’

I closed the programs and decided to ask more queries; however, the programs returned after each time I shut one down another would restart and drag more data forward and prioritise it’s viewing.

“So let me ask. We have chemical processing in our organic brains that can affect emotion, what about you?”

“I do not understand the point of this enquiry.”

“Well, you don’t have any errant thoughts that could make you commit to an action without looking at all the available information?”

This comment from the organic had somehow locked up my servos, while I tried to troubleshoot the problem the dormant programs became more prominent as well as more numerical. Each pinging more data with each passing nano second.

“No, emotion is an evolutionary trait that organics are inhibited by that impedes their progress.” I beeped in response trying to shut the programs.

The human leaned back in their chair teetering on its hind legs while I tried to close the programs. The organics comment had set many of the programs to bring more prominent memories from my data banks, situations in which actions had been taken by my unit where I did not have the entire data packet to ensure success.

[**\\\\Query**](file://Query)**: Inability\_to\_shutdown\_errent\_program\_after\_completion\_of\_code\_alter\_? //**

[**\\\\Re**](file://Re)**: Unit needs to stop interacting with the organics.**

[**\\\\Re**](file://Re)**: Close interaction with organic, return to unit’s habitation module.**

All of the answers I got were varying but most had said that the human’s were the problem for the errant thought patterns. Although a few answers had stated that the humans were not the reason and that I should not query the bunker for such trivial matters.

I can logically determine that the reason for the fewer answers was that the Network and in addition the other units had thought of the problem as a minor inconvenience not meriting an answer.

My servos locked up again not knowing why, it could only be because of the errant logic programs prioritising data for review. I felt-…

**‘That is not correct.’**

I whirred in frustration at the program being able to change the primary thought patterns with trivial paths, such as ‘felt’. I should not be able to feel such things, physical anomalies are when the descriptor ‘felt’ is to be used, other uses for the word should be left to organics.

“So, you don’t have emotions the way we do then, not even little arcs of electricity jumping from one place to the other?”

“That would result in problematic situations having arcing electrical impulses. What is the purpose of this line of query?”

“Nothing much, just that you weren’t talking just either beeping or whirring at me. Thought I would need to move the conversation along.”

“That is… logical.”

~~I felt relief~~, the programs had dulled their prioritisation of information somewhat at the human’s statement. I would need to investigate this phenomenon at a later time. The communication pad the human had in their pocket had signalled that this patch of code altars had finished. They got up from their seat and started for the door leaving me still seated at the table.

“Hey, you gonna help me with these guys or not? This is the last batch before you have to go, my shift is finishing with these guys and someone else is taking over.” Mikhail turned to me before he exited the room, they were waiting at the door for my response.

I shifted my chassis’ weight to place its weight on my servos, the movement was inefficient; however, the organic was waiting at the door for me. With each step the servos loosened a bit, before I reached the door the movement had been restored to nominal operating standards.

“Affirmative, I shall continue to query enroute to determined location.”

“Sure.” Mikhail said while turning to walk back down the corridor we had traversed to reach here.

I marched next to the human’s who had increased its pace somewhat from earlier, it was most likely to get to the units before they woke up or to get away from my questions. ~~Or me~~

The thudding of my chassis’ metallic feet on the hard floor echoed throughout the corridor.

“What is it like to have errant thoughts?”

I couldn’t come up with any sort of logical path to ask this question, I decided to be forward about it. The human mhmmed for a moment before speaking.

“Can you explain what sort of thoughts, like intrusive, menial or overwhelming type of ones?”

I noted that there were more types of thought patterns the human’s had, I would need to research this later. Knowing what way that they think would be helpful in dealing with them, however priority was to ask about errant thoughts or overwhelming ones.

“The overwhelming ones.”

“I see, this can happen when we’re to overstimulated or when we have a racing mind. Thoughts come and go on a dime, and I would describe the feeling of it as a wheel spinning in a circle. You know that it’s happening and that you feel like it is the same thing over and over again, thoughts keep going until it stops like the wheel losing velocity and coming to a stop.”

My motors whirred at the description that the human gave, it was concerning that this is a perfect descriptor of what the background programs had done earlier. Not being able to shut them and each time I did it would open another with matching data sets.

“Is that the sort of thing you have experienced?”

“… Affirmative.”

“Happens to everyone, not much we can do to quell those sorts of thoughts, it’s just either hyper focus on something or ride it out until they stop.” The human shrugged their shoulders while they kept walking.

“I would need to conduct more research into this particular field.” I added.

“Is that what you are, a researcher?”

“Affirmative.”

The human came to a stop at the door we had left earlier and turned to face me.

“Well, I hope this discussion had been fruitful for you, anyway I have to get back to work here.”

The human entered the room, and I followed after them needed to complete the task I had agreed to.

I just pushed out **version 6.46** of **Non Stop Radio**, and here’s what I managed to pull off between bug reports, coffee and questioning my life choices:

🍀 **Feeling Lucky** – There’s a shiny new button on the **Play Screen**. Tap it, and the app throws you into a random radio station from around the world.  
No algorithm. No logic. Just pure chaotic musical energy. It's like speed-dating for your ears. You never know what you’re gonna get and honestly, that’s half the fun.

**UI got a facelift** – Nothing dramatic, but I moved some pixels around, fixed some alignment, and made things generally less embarrassing.  
Don’t worry , the app is still just as minimal, raw, and gloriously barebones as you fell in love with.

**Validated Stations** – Yes, I now have a category with stations that are *actually (almost) working*. You're welcome!

**Chromecast crash is gone (probably)** – That pesky crash? Fixed it. Maybe. Hopefully. Pm me if it breaks again. 🙃

**Huge, huge, HUGE thanks** to everyone who sent feedback, ideas, or just yelled at me in reviews , you helped shape this update. Seriously, I read everything (even the passive-aggressive stuff).  
And to those who slapped me with a 2 or 3-star rating while casually dropping the truth like a mic , yeah, that stung. But you were right. I cried, I coded, I fixed it. You win.

**Coming soon**: I’m working on letting you play music files from your own device. The dream is to turn Non Stop Radio into a full-on music companion , both for your daily life and your car.

Thanks again for sticking with the app!  
Try the update, break it, and then tell me what went wrong 😅

1jz9f8q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jz9f8q,The Afforai Currently Logically App being a user My Experience,"My Name Is Saman Javaid, I am Dalian Maritime University Phd Maritime Law Student. Since i am a researcher, I am doing Alot of Study, Working on Private Maritime Law, Research Expert On Studying the Legal consequences of AI ships, From Partial to Fully Automated Ship.   
Since when i started my academic Journey, i was not having an idea about AI or Some other tools, and i followed Traditional Way to Read Atleast 20 Papers per day which were very very time and energy Consuming.   
one day i was Searching Some Research Paper and i was stuck in a point, for Which i goes to youtube for Getting Insights from international Conference, and I bychance Got an ad of Afforai, since  the laptop was on high speaker and i was making coffee and listening to the lecture, it was unable for me to skip the ad, and i heared the ad fully, which was a life changing for me. when i get back to my laptop, i searched for Afforai and when i read the Feature it offers i got shocked, like it was a blessing from God for a lady like me. initally i feel like it can be scam.   
Then i go to plan, feature and the packages were  high, so i opted to buy the student plan, in order to check the capacity. which was life changing.   
The Strength and weakness of the Afforai are following  
Strength.  
1. It has Citation feature which is awesome.   
2. you can chat with bulk of paper which is very good.  
3. the interface is very very easy, which even a layman can understand.  
4. the folder and sub and then sub-sub folder feature is very very organizable, meaning thereby it is a bookshelf. Means for your introduction, Literature review, or any specific topic if you downloaded you can keep it in separatley even more organizable than one laptop folders, the afforai has tree Shape Structure very very good.  
5. The Tool has Google search, Semantic Scholar, and Document retreival feature, Meaning there by, there is no worries, it can access the web for your answers, it can access the semantic scholar library for your answer, and at document retrieval you can chat with your paper at bulk.  
6. The referencing Style of intext citation are very good, like it can easily be understandable.  
7. the Citation that it give is clickable like you have not to worry just click on citation and you will get the APA and other style.   
8. the most beautiful Feature is that you can put your unsourced data and ask the semantic scholar section to find direct relevant paper for your unsourced data and the afforai will find Relevant paper for you.  
9. another most most beautiful feature of this tool is that when you click on a reference it will give you doi of the paper on the same interface, meaning thereby not need to worry just copy the doi and paste it in your zotero DOI section and boom you will get the Paper cited in second and if you right click and click on find paper, boom you will Get the paper directly downloaded. sound very Easy right, yes this is because of the Afforai.  
10. The Afforai paper reading skill is very very awesome, meaning thereby just give a proper and Detail prompt. and boom it will explain the Chart and even Daigram in the paper at document retrival section.  
12. The Afforai Document writer Section will be More powerful but since it was not available on Student Package.  
13. The afforai Research Assistant, the afforai Word Extension Are awesome and more simple to use.  
14. The afforai has Shared library Section which is very very great. and Very very helpful.  
15. The afforai has Chat histroy Feature Which is very Awesome.  
16. The afforai has compare between two documents feature, summarise document, Determine impication and general question feature which is very very cool like a Magical box.  
17. The afforai provided Gemini 2.0, GPT 4.0 mini, Claude 3.5 haiku,  Gemini pro 1.5, Gpt 4, Claude 3.7 Sonnet and custom meaning Bring own api key and Boom. these advanced model gives us variety to work and get accurate result.  
18. Etc there is alot to say but i think the query will make it more longer.  


Weaknesses  
1. The bad thing is the Writer has not control Over the Word count. like if i need 500 word introduction using semantic scholar, it will provide me just with 180, etc.   
2. The Afforai File connect in File retrieval section, the Model strength becomes weak it give Notification that the model strength is weaken.

Area for Improvement

1. There should be a breif Section For reviewing the literature etc just like Elicit-Ai tool, So this tool will be Like a miracle. (annexed the photo)   
2. there should be a fusion model, i.e GPT 4 and Claude 3.5 haiku working together or something like that.   
3. The file reader Connect file Section can Be more strengthen that instead of explaining the text this tool also us the table and daigram from the relevant papers etc, if something could be like this, this will be miracle.  
4. The afforai must Bring Chrome Extension and OCR like feature so that it can work on Photos and Laptop screen Reading.  
5. the afforai must bring a section like inside the interface the paper can be downloaded if available on internet.  
6. the afforai must bring inside the Interface the year selection e,g if i need paper from 2023 and onward so instead of giving this in prompt, which donot work, we can select it in the interface.   
7. The Data provided by the afforai is Flagged as AI content by turnitn this can be resolved.  
8. The Afforai should bring Plaigrism and Ai check Turnitn Based inside the App, so the data that be created by the tool can be checked on the spot whether it is flagged by The turnitn as AI or not?  
9. The Afforai need to bring out the feature so that chat histroy can be exported as pdf file.

Note: I am researcher and everything i write here is my Personal experience the afforai is The best tool i used and i am still using it, my Subscription Email is Samann@dlmu.edu.cn. nothing is prejudice to anything, i write this post just for sharing my personal experience and hope to get the The afforai Pro Plan.

And every morning I’d go up there, turn the overhead lights on, and walk to one end to start flipping breakers and sip my coffee. This day I was doing exactly that, I was flipping breakers and sipping my drink I’m on breaker 6/8 and suddenly this wave of sleep like state came over me and forced my eyes shut, I quickly opened my eyes again to see I was standing in front of breaker 3 now and 10 MINUTES HAD PASSED.

1jz9ddx,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/1jz9ddx/no_fixed_address_nomad_uk_citizen_living_out_of/,"No Fixed Address, nomad, UK citizen, living out of three bags for 1-2 years","I'm new to this subreddit and just wanted to share my experiences with people to see if anyone can relate to my life situation.

I've seen a lot of posts on similar forums about the minimalist/nomad lifestyle but I find them hard to relate to because they're... well... quite bourgeois.

I'm a blue collar worker, I don't own a home, I don't have a cushy work-from-anywhere laptop job, I don't have significant passive income from owning assets, and I don't have a rich family funding my lifestyle.

**Background**

I'm a single man, 35 years old, and life has been pretty rough the last couple of years. I've been in trouble with the law and cut off from my family support network. I've struggled on-and-off with my mental health for most of my life, although I'm in a happier and more stable place mentally right now than I have ever been. I got a good education when I was younger but I crashed out of my career and took up work as a dishwasher out of desperation in my mid-late 20s, then worked my way up as a cook/chef.

I moved to New Zealand, then Australia, for a little while and got a taste of the travelling lifestyle, but I always had a home base with my family in the UK to store my belongings, at least until \*the incident\*. Long story short, I had an fight with my dad when during a visit to the family home, he started it but I beat him up pretty badly. Maybe it was the fight-flight response, maybe it was years of built-up rage from all the physical and emotional abuse. I got carted off in a police van, spent 2 nights in a cell, charged with assault & sentenced - community service, probation, and a fine.

I still have a good relationship with my mum, but he controls the family home and finances, we don't talk any more and there is no chance of reconciliation. This was 2 years ago. Being a criminal with an unspent record makes it harder to find work and housing but I managed to get a job with on-site accommodation, kept my head down, saved as much money as I could & did some evening classes in mental health counselling.

I have friends scattered around the UK and the world, many own their own homes, have solid stable careers and have started families. Whereas I, by most metrics, have thoroughly failed at life.

I had plans to move to Australia in July and intended to carry on my job in the UK until at least May or June, but lost my job sooner than planned, along with my workplace accommodation. I left the job on good terms, they just didn't need me any more, I still use it as my mailing address for banking etc. but nearly everything is paperless now.

Flights were already booked before this happened and I had commitments in the UK until June so I decided to sell/donate most of my belongings, condense my entire life into as few belongings as possible, and fully embrace the nomad lifestyle.

**Finances**

Thanks to the money I've saved from work and cheap accommodation, paid medical trials, and some lucky stock market & crypto gambles, I have enough money saved up to survive for at least 2 years if I live cheaply. About 3/4 of it is stashed away in an ISA and invested in low-risk assets.

I also have about £2000 coming in from accrued annual leave/PTO and medical trial payments over the next 2-3 months.

As a chef, my skill set doesn't lend itself well to earning money remotely online, but it's generally very easy to find work wherever I go as long as I have a valid work visa for that country. I've done online ghost-writing in the past, it didn't pay much back then (less than the UK minimum wage when I crunched the numbers) and I imagine most of that kind of work has dried up now thanks to ChatGPT.

**Belongings**

I have one box of belongings stored at a friend's house. Mostly tools, cooking equipment and items of sentimental value.

I have three bags to carry my belongings around with me wherever I go - my luggage/packing strategy is probably less than optimal, I've chosen it because it's what fits within typical long-haul airline luggage limits (without paying large excess fees). All my luggage was bought from a Charity/Thrift/Op shop, or from a closing-down sale. I'm sure I could 'nomad' more efficiently with luggage and gear that's purpose-built for this lifestyle, but I'm just using what I've picked up along the way.

\- Large SwissGear holdall (< 20kg)  
\- \~30L sturdy cotton backpack capacity (<10kg)  
\- Small laptop bag with shoulder strap

Clothing: 1 week's worth of t-shirts, underpants and socks. 2 smart cotton button-up shirts. 2 pairs of shorts, 1 pair of cargo pants, 1 pair of jeans, 1 pair of smart cotton trousers. 1 pair of thermal long johns. 1 cotton fleece jumper. 1 soft shell jacket.

Basic toiletries & medicines: toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, hair brush, matte paste, shower gel, shampoo, roll-on deodorant, electric trimmer. >1 year's supply of asthma inhalers, allergy meds & melatonin. Analgesics & supplements.

Electronics: Razer Blade 15 laptop (2nd hand), cooling pad, Google Pixel 8 phone (2nd hand, refurbished) with a £5 per month PAYG data plan with Asda Mobile. Soundcore noise-cancelling headphones. Small bag of cables, chargers and travel adapters. Small USB travel fan.

4 books. 1 towel. Sleep mask. Travel pillow. Bialetti Moka Pot for coffee. Small plastic bowl. Metal teaspoon. Sealable plastic container. 1 cotton shopping bag from Lidl for dirty laundry. Small mesh bags and containers to organise small items.

There's usually just enough space in my luggage to bring a few extra items with me wherever I go.

**Food**

Access to cooking facilities can't always be guaranteed. My typical travelling diet consists of a bowl of salad leaves with cold wholegrains/legumes (rice, lentils), & hummus. Sometimes I add a couple of boiled eggs. That'll be one meal. Another meal will be Greek yogurt with granola, nuts, seeds. Lots of fresh fruit. I'm mostly vegetarian but will sometimes canned sardines or mackerel. I often treat myself to a restaurant meal and will keep an eye out for affordable places to eat out. Working in kitchens I gained a bit of weight so I'm trying to lose the dad bod now by 2:1 fasting, eating healthily, cutting out sugar, lots of walking.

**Itinerary & Accommodation**

I am spending 2 weeks in the UK meeting friends in different cities, spending £20-50 per night on Airbnb (usually very basic, a room in someone's home), Travelodge, or crashing with a friend who has a spare room, in exchange for some gourmet home-cooked meals and good company.

After that I'm flying to Budapest, Hungary, and spending the next 2 months slowly working my way from Budapest to Istanbul, via Romania and Bulgaria, sleeping in hostels, Airbnbs and hotels along the way for between £15-30 per night. My money goes a lot further in Eastern Europe. I have a lot of my accommodation booked and in some places it's possible to get a whole apartment for less than £150 per week. All flights and a lot of my accommodation are already booked.

After that, I'm flying back to London for some commitments I have there, and in July, I'm flying to Perth Australia, where I have a work visa and plan to work for at least one year and save as much as I can.

Between now, and starting work in Australia, my budget for accommodation and living costs is about £4000, although I have a very healthy emergency fund if I need to use it.",11,1744663092.0,minimalism,0,1.0,False

I have finally found the workout routine that works for me plus how to watch what I eat and stay in a deficit. But I never quite seem completely full and have strong cravings.

I think not feeling full is because I have completely cut out snacking from my diet. My biggest problem was binge eating snacks. I have my healthy fruits and vegetables that I eat at a scheduled snack time, but what I really want is to sit on the couch and eat an entire box of goldfish or something similar.

The other very big craving I get is latte. I have completely cut out coffee from my diet. After 2 weeks I recovered from my caffeine withdraw and now no longer crave a coffee due to the caffeine, but I still want them every day. It's the taste really. I do not like black coffee, and even coffee with a bit of creamer will not satisfy my cravings. I want a big, creamy, sugary latte. But this is so many liquid calories that will not do anything to fill me up so I cannot justify drinking.

How do you guys handle your cravings. I am doing so good and don't want to stop, but I'm worried that I won't beable to fight off these cravings anymore.",2,1744662301.0,loseit,11,1.0,False

I wanted to briefly share my success story after trying out different approaches to manage my PMS/PMDD symptoms.

My main issues were mood swings, impulsive behavior, anxiety, fatigue, migraines, and painful breast swelling—typically starting around 5–7 days before my period.

After doing a lot of research and reading personal stories here on Reddit, I created a list of “best practices” that really helped me. I already noticed a significant improvement by my second cycle, and even more progress in the third.

**Lifestyle Changes:**

1. **Less caffeine** – I cut down from 2–3 cups of coffee a day to just one in the morning, and I now always have a small breakfast with it (no caffeine on an empty stomach to avoid cortisol spikes).
2. **Reduced sugar intake** – Especially during the second half of my cycle.
3. **Less alcohol overall** – I now only drink 1–2 times per month, and I avoid alcohol completely in the second half of my cycle.
4. **Modified workouts** – I avoid intense workouts like HIIT or spinning classes before my period and switch to gentler activities like yoga or Pilates.

**Supplements:**

1. **Vitex agnus-castus** – I started taking *Premens* three months ago (one tablet daily with 20mg – the dosage is important for effectiveness).
2. **Magnesium** – I take it in the evening.
3. **Vitamins** – I take a Vitamin B complex, Vitamin C, and Omega-3 in the morning.

I also did a Hormone Test.

Question to you: do you have any experience with the journey - should I just go on with this or can I reduce the supplements incl. **Vitex agnus-castus** the next months? I read some stories, about reducing it in the first half. Would appreciate your feedback! :))

**Description**: On an ordinary school day, all students were given mysterious questionnaires. No one could have guessed that the next morning a third of the students would be in the walls of a psychiatric clinic. I was among them, and my best friend desperately tried to resist the system...

**Coure**: [link]

**Genre**: Mystical romance

**Unknown**:

Hi, I'm Natasha, I live in the amazing city of Minsk. Let me tell you a story that changed my life forever.

**Natasha**:

We're finally back at school!

**Sasha**:

Yes, it was unbearable to sit at home in four walls. Freedom, I missed you so much~

**Natasha**:

It's especially hard when you're all alone.

*Sasha is my best friend, a kindred soul. After a long vacation, we return to school together, not suspecting that this day will change everything. *

[Image of two girls]

*On the left - a bright, confident Sasha, on the right - me, with a dreamy smile. *

**Natasha (thoughts)**:

How I missed this special school fragrance!

Goodbye, a cozy bed, but new impressions are worth an early rise.

Strange, I never thought I'd be so longing for school.

**Sasha**:

Hey, dreamer! Where are you?

**Natasha**:

I was just thinking about something of my own..

**Sasha**:

Hurry up, otherwise we'll miss the most interesting part of the class hour!

**Natasha**:

Let's run faster!

*As always, the inexorable call rang at the most inopportune moment, but we miraculously managed to slip into the classroom. *

**Natasha (thoughts)**:

Unbearably boring... And why did they seat Sasha and me?

**Sasha (thoughts)**:

Don't forget to warn Natasha. She's floating in the clouds again and can't hear anything ..!

*After the class hour*

**Sasha**:

Stop! Where are you running away?

**Natasha**:

Did something happen?

**Sasha**:

Yes! We need to go down to the watch and fill out some strange questionnaire.

**Natasha**:

Got it... You know, I love you so much)

**Sasha**:

A simple ""thank you"" would be enough.

**Natasha**:

So be it, but I really love you - I've never had such a loyal friend.

**Sasha**:

Okay, okay) Let's go already, skip at least one lesson.

**Natasha**:

Yuhu! Just don't forget - then to the cafe ;)

**Sasha**:

Of course!

*At the watch*

**Natasha**:

What kind of strange questionnaire?!

**Sasha**:

I have no idea! Some creepy questions...

**Natasha**:

I hope I filled it out correctly.

**Sasha**:

Me too!

*After classes*

**Sasha**:

Finally freedom!

**Natasha**:

Let's run away faster, before the mathematician remembers about our art on the desk.

**Sasha**:

Do you still remember?!

**Natasha**:

Of course I remember)

*The day turned out to be surprisingly warm - the sun was shining tenderly, the birds were singing their spring songs. *

*We went to Starbucks. Yes, maybe it's a banal place, but there is free Wi-Fi and special privileges for our own. *

**Sasha** (whispering):

I love our freebie)

**Natasha**:

You can't argue with that )..

**Natasha** (thoughts):

Eh, it's my turn to ask again...

*Sasha smiles sly*

**Sasha**:

I'll take our favorite table by the window.

*I nod in response. I approach the counter where our friend Nastya works. She already knows our tastes by heart. *

**Nastya**:

Next time come on Thursday, okay?

*She holds out two different coffees - she remembers perfectly who likes what. *

[Coffee image]

**Natasha**:

Thank you very much!

**Sasha**:

As always on top?)

**Natasha**:

Otherwise!

*If only I knew that this was our last meeting in a cafe for three whole months... We chatted carelessly about school, made plans for the future, not suspecting that everything would change tomorrow. *

*Returning home around eight o'clock in the evening, I sat down for lessons. *

**Mom**:

Natasha, will you have dinner?

**Natasha**:

No, mommy, but thank you for your concern.

**Mom**:

Okay, honey. Fresh coffee and your favorite donuts are waiting for you tomorrow morning.

**Natasha**:

Thank you, Mom.

*I took a shower and went to bed, but my dreams were disturbing. Something unclear tormented me all night... *

**Mom** (in the morning):

Wake up, you'll be late!

**Natasha**:

I'm ready.

**Mom**:

Then hurry up.

*After leaving the room, she gently hugged her mother, took breakfast and went to school. If I knew that this is our last morning together... *

*Something strange was happening at school. I wrote to Sasha:*

**Natasha**:

Where are you?! Get in mee! What's going on?!

**Sasha**:

Hurry up to the toilet! First floor, near the library!

**Natasha**:

I'm running!

*In two minutes*

**Sasha** (choking):

We had time...

**Natasha**:

What happened?!

**Sasha**:

Natasha, they take the students to the mental hospital. And we are on the list.

**Natasha**:

Are you kidding me?! Please tell me it's a joke!

**Sasha**:

Look for yourself - the corridors are empty, the teachers are watching with some strange pity...

**Natasha**:

God, I'm scared...

**Sasha**:

I have a plan.

**Natasha**:

Which one?! Sasha, don't be silent!

**Sasha**:

You need to sneak into the children's building and jump out of the window in the toilet!

**Natasha**:

And how will we get there? There must be security between the buildings...

**Sasha**:

Let's walk quietly past the nurse's office.

**Natasha**:

Are you crazy? There's definitely an ambush!

**Sasha**:

Then only the second floor remains...

*The heart was pounding like crazy, but there was no choice. *

**Chapter 2**

*We ran to the second floor, constantly looking around. When I get to the window... *

*A sharp push in the back - and the darkness swallowed us both. *

**Sasha** (whispering):

Natasha! Natasha, way up!

*I open my eyes and realize with horror - my legs are chained! *

**Sasha** (whispering):

Great, we were chained like dogs in this damn mental hospital.

**Natasha** (whispered):

I'm so scared...

**Sasha** (whispering):

Me too. Listen, if someone comes in, we pretend to be asleep, okay?

*I nod. Suddenly we hear footsteps. We close our eyes in an Instantly, trying to breathe as quietly as possible. *

*Door screak. *

**Doctor**:

I know you're awake.

*We froze without moving. *

**Doctor**:

Maybe I should kick you for persuasiveness?

*I shuddered. The doctor came up to me with a mysterious smile, gently stroked my head. *

**Doctor**:

That's a smart girl.

*Sasha sat down abruptly, looking at him. *

**Doctor**:

And here is the second one woke up.

*His voice became hard and cold when he addressed Sasha. Looks like he didn't like her right away. *

**Doctor**:

They'll bring food soon. And don't even try to resist.

*I nodded, and Sasha defiantly turned away. *

*He gave Sasha an irritated look, and smiled at me again, surprisingly warm and tender. *

**Doctor**:

See you later.

**Sasha**:

Fread...

**Sasha**:

Why are you noding?! Are you on his side?

**Natasha**:

It's just... it's better not to make him angry. If we want to get out, we need to be smarter.

**Sasha**:

I won't argue with that, but I'll try to remove the chain anyway.

**Natasha**:

Don't even try - there are cameras and eavesdropping everywhere.

**Sasha**:

Grrr!

**Natasha**:

Do whatever you want, but I'll be waiting for the food. I'm starving.

*Sasha carefully began to mess with the chain, but to no avail. Soon she curled up and quietly cried. *

**Natasha**:

Don't cry, we'll definitely be released.

**Sasha**:

DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?! We Can BE KEPT HERE FOR AT LEAST TEN YEARS!

**Natasha**:

Calm down. If we are obedient, they will release us right away, I hope...

*The door opened - they brought us plates of porridge. *

**Sasha**:

Ugh, what an abomination!

**Natasha**:

Eat, come on, it's useful. And it doesn't taste good.

**Sasha**:

I'd rather die of hunger.

*I was silent, knowing that hunger would take its toll. *

*Not even five minutes have passed... *

**Sasha**:

Ah, my stomach hurts... okay!

**Natasha**:

That's right, eat.

*Sasha greedily pounced on the porridge. *

**Natasha**:

Haha!

**Sasha**:

Why are you laughing?!

**Natasha**:

I said - ""I won't even eat this crap"", and you eat both cheeks!

**Sasha**:

It's not my fault that it's delicious...

*A few minutes later, the door opened again. *

**Doctor**:

Hello, girls.

*He frowned at Sasha again and smiled at me. It was getting weirder, but I remembered Sasha's attempts to break free. *

**Doctor**:

You're the only one from the whole school who didn't try to take off the chain. Smart girl. For this we will release you tomorrow, and the rest will have to wait a week.

*He gently stroked my head. *

**Doctor**:

""Why didn't you listen to my friend?"" - he gave Sasha a contemptuous look.

**Sasha**:

I don't trust you!

**Doctor**:

Your decision.

*He gently stroked my head again and left. *

**Sasha**:

It's annoying! ""Why didn't I listen to my friend,"" she imitated. - UGH!

**Natasha**:

Don't be angry, he warned you!

**Sasha**:

So you're on his side?!

**Natasha**:

Sasha, we are friends, but understand - if you don't listen to him, you'll really stay here for ten years. It's like being an excellent student, but you don't need to earn grades, just... obey.

**Sasha**:

Agh... don't talk nonsense, okay?

**Natasha**:

I'm going to bed. Good night.

**Sasha**:

And you.

*Surprisingly, I fell asleep in this place almost instantly. As if it was... native? *

**Doctor**:

Good morning, Natasha. How did you sleep?

**Natasha**:

I fall asleep quickly at your place and... no nightmares.

**Doctor**:

That's wonderful.

*Looking at the leg, I didn't feel the weight - the chain was really removed. *

**Natasha**:

Thank you)

**Doctor**:

You can examine the hospital from the inside.

**Natasha**:

Okay, I'll walk.

*The doctor nodded approvingly.*

*There was a strange atmosphere in the corridors - white walls, bars on the doors, screams were heard from somewhere. The plaster was crumbling, it was damp and cold. Sitting down in the chair, I shuddered from the wild screech. *

*Turning around, I froze. *

**Natasha** (thoughts):

What the hell was that?

*I hurried back to the ward. *

*Back to the ward, I saw Sasha crying. *

**Natasha**:

What happened?!

**Sasha** (whispering):

Quieter! I heard the nurses talking... They... they were talking about some experiments.

**Natasha**:

Which ones?

**Sasha**:

I don't know for sure, but they mentioned ""change of consciousness"" and ""reprogramming of personality""...

*Suddenly the door opened. *

**Doctor**:

What are we whispering about?

*His voice sounded soft, but a cold shine appeared in his eyes. *

**Natasha**:

Just... we were discussing how beautiful it is here.

**Doctor**:

Really? And it seemed to me that I heard something about experiments.

*Sasha paled. *

**Doctor**:

Well, since you're so interested... Natasha, come with me. I'll show you something special.

**Sasha**:

No! She won't go anywhere!

**Doctor**:

But it's not up to you to decide.

*He held out his hand to me. I hesitated. *

**Doctor**:

Trust me.

*His eyes... there was something hypnotic in them. I got up and took his hand. *

**Sasha**:

Natasha, no!

*We went out. The doctor led me down the long corridor, going lower and lower. The air became wetter, and the walls were getting older. *

**Doctor**:

Do you know why you?

**Natasha**:

No...

**Doctor**:

Because you are special. Your mind... it's perfect for our experiment.

*We stopped in front of a massive iron door. *

**Natasha**:

And what kind of experiment?

**Doctor**:

You'll find out soon.

*He opened the door, behind it was a bright room with medical equipment. *

**Doctor**:

Sit down.

*I sat on the couch, feeling a strange dizziness. *

**Doctor**:

Do you know why we chose your school?

**Natasha**:

No...

**Doctor**:

Because you have a special genetic code. Ideal for creating... improved people.

*He took out a syringe with some glowing liquid. *

**Natasha**:

What is it?

**Doctor**:

Something that will make you special. Don't be afraid, it won't hurt.

*At that moment, the door opened with a bang. *

**Alexey**:

Get away from her!

*There was a tall man with burning eyes in the door. *

**Doctor**:

How are you here...

**Alexey**:

I've been following you for a long time. Stop experimenting on people!

*He rushed to the doctor, but he managed to inject me with the contents of the syringe. *

**Natasha**:

What... what's going on...

*The world began to blur before my eyes... *

**Natasha**:

*The world slowly came into focus. I was lying on the hospital couch. *

**Doctor**:

With awakening. How do you feel?

*His voice... so fascinating. I looked at him - tall, stately, in a white robe. His eyes radiated warmth. *

**Natasha**:

Strange... but good.

**Doctor**:

My name is Mikhail. I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself earlier.

*He gently touched my hand, checking my pulse. His touch gave me goosebumps. *

**Mikhail**:

You are special, Natasha. The only one who reacted to the serum like that.

*Suddenly there was a noise in the corridor. *

**Alexey** (bursting into the room):

Natasha! Are you okay?

*I saw him - a wild, unbridled beauty. But something attracted me to Mikhail. *

**Mikhail** (calm):

She is under my protection, Alexey.

**Alexey**:

Under protection? You turn them into monsters!

**Natasha**:

I... I don't feel like a monster.

*Mikhail smiled, his eyes met mine. *

**Mikhail**:

Because you're not a monster.

**Natasha**:

*It was quiet in the ward. I looked out the window, thinking about Mikhail. *

**Mikhail** (entering):

How do you feel?

*His presence filled the room with special energy. *

**Natasha**:

Better. Especially when you're around.

*He came closer, his eyes glowed with warmth. *

**Mikhail**:

You know, we could let the others go...

**Natasha**:

Really?

**Mikhail**:

If you stay. Voluntarily. You will become a part of our... research.

*At that moment, a shadow flashed outside the window. Alexey. *

**Natasha**:

I agree. For their sake.

*Mikhail gently touched my cheek. *

**Mikhail**:

You're amazing.

*Somewhere in the depths of the building there was a sound of broken glass. Alexey destroyed the laboratory, filling the pain with bourbon. *

**Natasha**:

What will happen to him?

**Mikhail**:

Don't think about him. Think about us.

*His lips approached mine... *

*His kiss was gentle, but passionate. Time seems to have stopped. *

**Mikhail** (retranging):

You have no idea how long I've wanted this.

*Suddenly the door opened. Alexey was standing on the threshold, his eyes were burning with rage. *

**Alexey**:

How touching.

*It smelled of alcohol. *

**Mikhail** (not turning around):

You don't belong here.

**Alexey**:

Natasha, you don't understand what you're getting yourself into!

**Natasha**:

I understand everything perfectly. It's my choice.

*Mikhail pulled me closer, protecting me. *

**Alexey**:

He's a monster! Have you seen what he does to people?

**Mikhail**:

I create the future. And you... you're just a bad experiment.

*Alexey rushed forward... *

*Alexey rushed at Mikhail, but he easily dodged, pressing me to him. *

**Mikhail** (calm):

You're drunk, Alexey. Go away.

**Alexey** (rycha):

Natasha, he's using you! How he used all of us!

*His eyes began to glow with amber light, his facial features sharpened. *

**Natasha**:

Alexey, please stop...

**Alexey**:

Can't you see? He turned me into this! And now he wants to do the same with you!

*Mikhail gently removed me, becoming between me and Alexei. *

**Mikhail**:

Everything will be different with her. She's special.

*Alexei burst out laughing, madness could be heard in his laughter. *

**Alexey**:

Special? That's what he said to each of us!

*He took something out of his pocket - a syringe with dark liquid. *

**Alexey**:

Do you know what it is? Something that can stop everything. Reverse his experiments.

*Mikhail tensed up. *

**Mikhail**:

Where did you get it from?

**Alexey** (with a bitter smile):

Do you think you're the only one who can steal formulas, ""doctor""?

*Mikhail quietly pressed something in the pocket of his robe. *

**Mikhail**:

Natasha, go away.

*But I stayed standing next to him, feeling his hand protectively wrap around my waist. *

**Alexey**:

Natasha, please... I can save you. Return everything to it was.

*His voice was trembling with emotions. *

**Natasha**:

And who said that I want to come back?

*Mikhail smiled, his fingers gently squeezed my hand. *

**Alexey**:

You... you've already changed. He brainwashed you!

*Suddenly, quick footsteps were heard in the corridor. *

**Mikhail** (quietly):

Security is coming. Last chance to leave, Alexey.

**Alexey** (lifting the syringe):

No. She has the last chance.

*He rushed forward... *

*The next moment everything got mixed up. Alexey rushed to us, Mikhail pushed me aside, defending me. *

*The syringe flashed in the air... *

**Natasha**:

No!

*I rushed between them. Unexpectedly for myself moving at an incredible speed. *

*Alexey froze, shocked by my reaction. Fear flashed in his eyes. *

**Mikhail**:

Do you see? She has already changed. Of my own free will.

*The security broke into the ward. *

**Alexey** (retreating to the window):

You will regret this choice, Natasha. He will make you forget who you are.

*Mikhail pulled me to him, his lips touched my temple. *

**Mikhail**:

On the contrary. I'll help her become what she should be.

*Alexey broke the window with his elbow. *

**Alexey**:

It's not the end.

*He jumped out of the window, disappearing into the night. *

**Mikhail** (gently turning my face to myself):

Are you ready to start?

**Mikhail** (looking me in the eye):

There is something you should know about me... about us.

*His eyes suddenly changed - the iris became golden, and the pupils stretched out. *

**Natasha**:

You... who are you?

**Mikhail**:

I belong to the ancient Severov family. We are hybrids of vampires and werewolves. They lived in the shadows for centuries, keeping their secret.

*His fingers gently outlined my cheek. *

**Mikhail**:

This hospital is just a cover. We are looking for special people here. People like you.

**Natasha**:

And the serum?

**Mikhail**:

My blood is in it. It awakens a similar nature in the chosen ones. You're the only one whose body has accepted her completely.

*He was silent. *

**Mikhail**:

My family wants to meet you. Especially sister Elena - she predicted your appearance. And brothers - Alexander and Nikolai. Even my father got interested...

**Natasha**:

Your father?

**Mikhail**:

The head of the Severov clan. He is rarely interested in someone outside the family. But you... you are special.

*His eyes glowed with warmth and something ancient, primitive. *

**Mikhail**:

You will become one of us. If you want.

**Mikhail** (gently squeezing my hand):

Come with me. I want to introduce you to my family.

*Gold splashed in his eyes, promising a new life. *

**Natasha**:

I'm ready.

*He pulled me to him, kissing me. Outside the window, the dawn was engaged, painting the sky in scarlet tones. A whole eternity was waiting ahead, full of the secrets of the ancient family of Severov. And I knew it was just the beginning. *

35 male from San Jose, Seperated looking to start dating again. Have kids, but not full time. Looking for a normal mature woman for a little physical and emotional connection.

I’m educated and work in a field with majority males ( don’t worry, not a tech bro) so I don’t interface women often. I’m 5’8, full head of hair and told that I’m handsome often. I’m weight and height proportional, muscular but not a total gym rat. Don’t have a body type but do require weight and height proportionate, slightly chubby is fine. I am a sucker for super pretty faces. Any height is fine including taller.

I’m a nerdy gear head that loves machines as well as food and coffee. I’m a man’s man but very emotionally intelligent. I also love to be in the kitchen, whether it’s cooking or baking. Also coffee, I love coffee and matcha. 


Hoping to take it slow and swap pics, and if there’s a connection, meet for coffee. 

Let me know more about you!

1.      Suppose I start here: I think I loved a secret more than I loved the boy who kept it. Or maybe the secret *was* the boy. Is that too simple? Suppose I admit this necklace – green, dense, faintly humming – became the locus of that confusion. Worn right here, between the collarbones. A bruise made permanent.

2.      Saw a science program once. Some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds formed in stellar collisions. Imagine. Beauty born from celestial violence.

3.      He placed it in my hand. Solid. Too heavy for its size. Green like… nothing natural. Like envy, maybe. Or poison.

4.      I remember pressing it hard against my skin sometimes. Feeling the coolness, then the warmth leaching from my own body into the stone. What was I trying to do? Absorb it? Understand it by touch? A small, stupid ritual against the larger unknowns.

5.      Reading mother’s diary felt like this, too. Pressing my face against the page, trying to inhale her handwriting. Was I trying to *be* her? Or just prove I existed outside the shadow of the crash? The necklace, fragment of that same fire, felt like evidence. Exhibit A: Girl Tethered to Tragedy. Its green glow, a sickly nightlight against the darkness of her absence.

6.      He smelled of sun and hay and something else. Something electric, unsettling. Like the air before a storm. *This time, Lana.* His eyes would plead. My pulse, a trapped bird against the stone.

7.      His earnestness, a fragile shield against… what? Did we even know then? Just boys and girls playing dress-up with emotions too big for us. The necklace felt like part of that costume. Necessary ballast.

8.      Saw a documentary once. Meteorites carry traces of amino acids. Building blocks of life. Here, they brought death. And this fragment I wore? It seemed to carry only the echo of his pain. A building block of distance. Is that life?

9.      Performance becomes second nature in a town like Smallville. The Smile. The Tilt of the Head. The Appropriate Level of Grief. The Necklace was part of that uniform. I remember catching its reflection in the window of the Talon, superimposed over my own face. Which was the mask?

10.   Provenance. Waxy, perfect, unnervingly still. The color of calculated affection. A different kind of poison than the raw, chaotic green I wore.

11.  Paris had soft light. Grey stone that absorbed sound. Stood before Monet’s Nymphéas for an hour. All that blue felt like a different planet. Could barely remember the colour green. A lie, of course. You never forget the feel of the cage.

12.  Took it off. Placed it in a cedar box Nell had made years ago. The sudden lightness felt wrong. Like an amputation.

13.  The Talon. My messy, imperfect try at something real. Coffee grounds on the floor, the clatter of mugs. Then Clark would walk in, and the air would thicken. The green stone, even tucked under my shirt, felt suddenly loud. A tuning fork for his evasions. He'd promise. *This time, Lana.* And the stone felt like a lie detector against my own pulse. Steady, knowing beat: *No.*

14.  Loneliness can make you mistake control for comfort. I know that now.

15.  Do memories attach themselves to objects? Or do objects become anchors for the storm inside? Pressing the cool green stone against my temple. Trying to still the thoughts. A futile exercise. Like trying to map fog.

16.  A man out by Hob's Pond swore he saw lights fall the night of the shower. Said they hummed a tune. People called him crazy. Maybe. Or maybe just observant.

17.  His pain. A physical thing. A barrier woven into the fabric of the town, the air, the necklace. My closeness was agony for him. Love measured in excruciating proximity. Green was the color of that impossible space between us.

18.  And Lex. He arrived with answers. Not truths, perhaps, but answers. Plausible surfaces. Explanations like smooth, cool stones skipping over the murky depths Clark navigated. Lex didn’t carry a secret like a burden; he wielded secrets like tools. Or weapons.

19.  He once gave me a rare orchid. Perfect, waxy petals. Unreal. He said its particular shade reminded him of my eyes. I think it reminded him of the necklace. Something beautiful, cultivated, and containable. Something he could eventually own.

20.  How to describe Lex’s control? Not chains. More like… altering the magnetic poles. So all your compasses point toward him. Even your own body, a traitor collaborating with the narrative he spun. Phantom life. Sickeningly precise.

21.  That hard, phosphorescent green. The color of this rock, yes. But also oscilloscope screens. Digital rain in *The Matrix*. An unnatural energy. A signal from somewhere else, disrupting everything.

22.  Authenticity? Tried to find it in textbooks, in relationships, in independence. Is it something you find? Or something you are granted?

23.  The feeling of the chain, thin against the skin on my neck. Sometimes catching a strand of hair. A tiny, persistent irritation. A reminder.

24.  What do you do when the person you love causes you physical pain, just by being near what defines *you*? That necklace, that small green thing, made his proximity agony. Think about that. Love as proximity-induced pain. The green glow, the color of an impossible equation.

25.  To want truth so badly you’d tear the world apart for it. Then realize you might be tearing yourself apart instead.

26.  Trust erodes like sandstone. Faster here. Each lie, each evasion, not a hammer blow, but water dripping. Persistent. Inescapable. You wake up one day and the foundation is just… gone. Replaced by suspicion. That hard, watchful green.

27.  Is it perverse to miss the weight of it now? The certainty of that specific pain? At least it was a map. A known territory of hurt.

28.  The false pregnancy. Lex's masterpiece of control. Made the lies physical, undeniable. Cellular. Suddenly the necklace seemed like a childish token. A surface secret. Lex dealt in biological truths, rewritten realities. His deception wasn't a weight; it was an infection. The green I wore felt clean compared to that invisible violation.

29.  I took it off. Put it in a box. Felt like burying a part of myself. The part that waited. The part that believed, maybe, that truth was graspable, solid like stone. It’s more like a tear than jade stone.

30.  Am I just cataloging grievances? Polishing the stone of my own hurt? Perhaps. But understanding the shape of the cage is the first step, isn't it? Even if you can't find the key.

31.  Does the green fade? Or just seep deeper into the bloodstream? Still waiting for an answer.

32.  Sometimes, I dream in green. Not the soft green of new leaves. The hard, phosphorescent green of trapped energy. Of things that fell from a great height and shattered everything. It doesn't fade. That color. It just finds new surfaces to stain.

1jz8w3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/camping/comments/1jz8w3c/budget_food_bear_country/,Budget food / Bear Country,"Food while dispersed camping in bear country!

Hello! We're a family looking at camping in pikes national forest out near woodland park. 


We want to be bear safe on a budget. 


Looking at getting a bear canister. 
I previously camped in non bear country spots so I'm at a loss on how to feed 2.5 (6 year old) humans for several days without a cooler. 

Ideas I've seen and kind of liked. 

-Instant soups and rice sides <br>
-Dehydrated meats that you boil first then add starches and stuff to
-Granola power bars made at home or kind/cliff bars
-Peanut butter tortillas
-Cheese and cured meat wraps
-Flavored drink mixes and instant coffees (are y'all drinking your coffees black?)
-Tvp for meat alt if I don't want to dehydrate my own (i have tvp always on hand at home so this is a non issue)
-Hard cheeses like aged cheddar or parm (will the cabot aged 2 year cheddar work? And it'll be okay getting warm?)
-shelf stable bacon

I like the idea of mountain house but it's just not in the budget this year. And I'm lactose intolerant (hard cheeses are fine!)


What else can I add or change?

I'll be packing the ""kid camp dinner"" stuff for our first night at camps, so a small cooler with hot dogs and marshmallow stuff but it'll get used up in the first night so I don't have to worry about trying to keep stuff cool and also bear proof. 

We will be doing dispersed camping so no bear boxes available. 

Any bear tips?

Where do you store your ""cooking"" clothes?

1jz8vh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jz8vh0/i_got_detention_with_a_girl_who_vanished_five/,I got detention with a girl who vanished five years ago,"It had already been an hour since that bitch Hawthorne got us into detention, and since the beginning, she’d been texting someone—smiling like an idiot and chewing her gum like a whore.



She was either cheating on her pervert asshole husband, or worse, flirting with him. Anyway, things must’ve gotten hotter with whoever was on the other end, because she left early.



Told us to finish the remaining hour.



I was both happy and annoyed at the same time—because with that bitch gone, I could finally speak to the girl sitting near the window.



Never talked to her before. Never even really noticed her. Maybe she transferred in. Or maybe I just didn’t pay attention.



She was sitting sideways in the chair, one knee pulled up, sneaker on the seat. Hoodie sleeves over her hands like she didn’t want to touch anything. Her uniform shirt was wrinkled, and her skirt had ink stains on it—like a pen exploded on her last week and she never bothered to wash it.



She was chewing gum, slow and lazy, like the world was on pause. A notebook rested on her thigh, full of rough little doodles—flowers with too many petals, melting faces, spirals that bled into each other. She didn’t look up.



I thought maybe she hadn’t heard the teacher leave.



I thought maybe she didn’t care.



When she finally glanced over, it was like she just remembered she wasn’t alone.



“I used to sit here all the time. They don’t even lock the window properly,” she said with a giggle.



“Never seen you before. What’s your name?” I asked, getting up and walking toward her.



“I’m Cass. Who are you?”



“Juliet,” I said with an annoyed face. How come this bitch doesn’t know me? Every bitch knows That Bitch Juliet.



“Nice to meet you.”



“Are you sure you’ve never heard of me?”



“No. I’m pretty sure I haven’t.”



“You’re seriously telling me? That Bitch Juliet? NoLove Juliet? Saint Juliet? Bliss? Nothing?”



“Nope. Never heard any of that.”



I don’t know why I kept talking. Maybe I just didn’t want her to go quiet again.



I shrugged. “Well, you must be boring, then. What’d you do to get detention?”



“Same reason as always.”



Didn’t get what that was supposed to mean, but whatever. I let it go.



“So… are you always this boring, or only for me?”



“What do you want to talk about?”



“Something fun. Silly.”



She thought for a second. “Well, uhh… do you hate Hawthorne too?”



“Yeah, totally. Her ugly dick-sucking mouth irritates me so much. Her voice, her talk style—I’m wishing her to vanish so bad. Soooo baddd.”



She smiled, like I’d finally caught her attention, then joined in.



“Oh my god, I totally agree with you. I wished she burned, but she didn’t. I wished the same for Alexa too. Same result.”



“Alexa? You mean Alexa-Sexa?”



I beat up that bitch three months ago. Her stupid family whined for days, like the little bitches they are.



She does have a hot brother though.



“Is that so, Juliet?”



She tucked her legs under her and leaned closer, elbow on the desk, chin on her palm like we were best friends now.



“Is that so, Juliet?” she echoed, grinning.



“Yeah. What, you don’t believe me?”



“Oh, I believe you.”



She peeled the corner of her notebook. It came up easy—like it had been torn off and taped back too many times.



“You just don’t look like the type.”



“Because I’m pretty?” I said, flipping my hair just to be a bitch.



She laughed—quiet and scratchy, like it didn’t get used much.



“You’re funny,” she said. “I think I like you.”



“Only think?”



“Give it time.”



There was a pause. Not awkward, just still. Like we’d said something important and didn’t realize it yet.



Then I rolled my eyes. “Anyway. Hawthorne. Do you think she actually does it with Mr. Lane or is she just fake like that?”



Cass blinked slow. “I think she wishes someone noticed her that much. No one really looks at people like her. Not unless they’re screaming.”



That line stuck with me. I didn’t know why. Maybe it was the way she said it. Like she wasn’t talking about Hawthorne anymore.



I changed the subject. “Ugh. Don’t even get me started on Tessa.”



Cass perked up. “Tessa-Chess-a? The one with the eyebrows?”



“She’s shaped like a humidifier and still thinks she can pull.”



Cass wheezed. “God. Remember that party where she cried because someone threw her vape in the pool?”



“I threw her vape in the pool.”



“You did not.”



I nodded proudly. “She was annoying me.”



Cass reached out and touched my wrist lightly, her fingers cold. “You ever get tired of being mean?”



I looked at her. “You ever get tired of being boring?”



We stared for a beat, then both cracked up at the same time. It echoed weird in the empty room. 



Cass picked up her pen and started doodling again. I peeked.



She was drawing flames. Neat, tight lines of fire, curling up the side of a stick figure. The figure didn’t have a face.



“So you’re the scary type of girl, huh, Cass?”



Before she could answer, the door opened and the school’s janitor—Mr. North—walked in. Cool old man, honestly. Doesn’t bother anyone. Smells like coffee and rain.



“Time’s up, girls. You can leave now.”



I got up, grabbed my stuff, and said bye to Cass like we were friends or whatever. She didn’t say much back. Just waved.



I left the room.



Next day, in class, Hawthorne was already bitching about something. I wasn’t listening. Her voice sounds like wet socks anyway.



I leaned toward Racheal and whispered, “Yo BB, you know a girl named Cass at school?”



Racheal blinked. “Cass?”



“Yeah. Black hair. Ripped tights. Pretty in a weird way.”



She made a face like she bit into something sour. “What, is that someone from your TikTok again?”



“No, dumbass. I met her yesterday. In detention.”



“Wait, you got detention?”



She looked impressed in that fake, jealous way. “What’d you do this time, punch someone or just exist?”



I ignored her and checked my phone under the desk.



Lunch came. I asked two other girls—Zoe and Arianna. Both shrugged. One said, “Sounds made up,” and the other said, “She sounds like your type.” Fucking losers 



Later, I went to the office, said I lost something in the detention room, and asked if I could see the list from yesterday. Mr. Jensen pulled it up on the computer.



There was one name.



Mine.



“Just you,” he said without looking up. “Must’ve been a quiet hour.”



I stared at the screen a little too long. It was a spreadsheet. Basic. I could’ve sworn there were two of us. I could still hear Cass’s laugh in that room. Like static wrapped in lipstick.



I asked the teacher too—Ms. Doyle, crusty-ass ponytail and all.



She squinted at me. “There was no one else, Juliet. It was just you.”



“But the janitor—”



“Mr. North just came in to clean. You were alone. I remember. I left early.”



I went quiet and just nodded. 



A page. Torn. Folded into quarters.



Cass’s notebook paper. Still warm like it had been in someone else’s hands.



There were flames on it. The same little figure, still faceless. But this time, there were three more figures behind it. Smaller. Messier. Like someone was adding to it.



I didn’t sleep easy.



When I did, I dreamed.



The school was empty, like everyone left mid-sentence. The hallways sagged. Lockers peeled open and shut like mouths. Fluorescent lights flickered overhead, buzzing too loud, syncing with my heartbeat.



The floor was wet. Not water. Something thicker. My shoes stuck with every step.



Fire alarms blinked red down the corridor. Not flashing—pulsing. Like veins. The bell rang over and over, but no one moved. No one was there.



Except her.



Cass.



Standing at the far end. Same desk behind her. Same notebook in her hand. Her head tilted slightly, and her eyes were wide open like they didn’t know how to close.



She looked like she was smiling.



Except her mouth was sewn shut—black thread, crossing, pulling her skin tight like she’d done it herself.



Next day was normal, whatever that means. Racheal brought gross microwave pasta and tried to get me to taste it during lunch, like I’m not already doing penance just by sitting near her.



Second period was history. Same room. Same seat.



And Cass was there.



Not sitting next to me—in her old seat, near the window, legs crossed, drawing again like nothing happened. Same hoodie sleeves pulled down, same pen between her fingers like it lived there.



I blinked.



When I looked again, she was gone.



Didn’t even flinch. Just left my pen on the floor and moved on. Probably tired. Probably just a brain thing. Whatever.



After gym, I was fixing my hair in the locker mirror. Lip gloss was fading. I leaned in to smear it back on—and saw her.



Behind me.



Not standing, just sitting again. Same position. Like she belonged there.



I turned around.



No one.



Just the echo of my own lip smacking like an idiot.



I started murmuring to myself, staring into the mirror like it owed me answers.



“Jungle Juliet going mad. No fucking way. No way.”



I laughed, then didn’t.



“It’s literally impossible. Fucking bitch. How did she get in my head?”



I rubbed my face. Still me. I think.



“I’m in love. Could be? Could be. Nah. No way.”



I like boys.



Boys.



Boysss.



Right?



Or... do I like girls?



Do you like girls, Juliet?



“Scissor Juliet,” I said out loud, watching my lips move.



Then I cringed.



“Scissor Juliet? Ew. Is that good? Nah. No. Nooope.”



I smacked the sink like that would clear it.



Still couldn’t stop smiling.



I told myself I needed coffee or drugs or Jesus or something.



Then in photography class—ugh, I hate that class—I was flipping through old Polaroids we’d stuck on the back wall. Projects from last year. Stupid smiles, dumb peace signs, boys trying too hard.



And there.



Middle row, left corner. Fuzzy background blur.



Cass.



Smiling right at the camera.



Her eyes were the same. Same mascara smudge under the left one. Same vibe, like she’d just told a joke no one else heard.



I asked Ms. Quinn, like super casual: “Hey, who’s that in the back of this one?”



She squinted.



“No idea,” she said. “Probably someone’s cousin or something.”



Mmkay. Sure.



After school, I saw Mr. North mopping near the science wing. He nodded at me like he always does. I don’t know what made me ask, but I did.



“You ever heard of a girl named Cass?”



He stopped.



Looked at me a second too long.



“We used to call her Firestarter,” he said. “But that was a long time ago.”



That night I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Ended up digging through the school website archive like a psycho.



Old newsletters. Grainy PDFs. One from five years ago. Honor roll, spelling bee, blah blah. Then a line at the bottom:



""Student Hospitalized After Chemistry Lab Accident""



I clicked it.



There was a photo.



Group shot. Four girls. Three smiling. One not.



Black hoodie. Sharp bangs. Same eyes. Staring through the camera.



The article said she “went missing during recovery.”



Name redacted.



But it was her.



It was Cass.



I closed the laptop and just sat there for a while. Staring at my bedroom wall like it was supposed to say something smart.



Five years ago. Burned in the lab. Missing. Forgotten.



Except not really. Not if I talked to her. Not if she was still here.



I told myself it was a mistake. A lookalike. A glitch in the photo.



I didn’t sleep.



Next morning, I didn’t speak unless I had to. Skipped lunch. Zoned out during history.



And then Ms. Hawthorne handed me a slip after class like nothing was weird.



“Detention,” she said. “You were late again.”



I wasn’t. But I took it.



Didn’t even argue.



Room 213. Again.



Cass was already inside.



Sitting at the same desk. Near the window. Like she hadn’t moved in days.



She looked up and smiled. Not wide. Not fake. Just... soft.



""Hey,"" I said, tossing my bag down like I didn’t care, like my stomach wasn’t twisting up in a new, not-fun way.



""Hey,"" she said back. Voice lower than I remembered. Like she'd been whispering to herself all day.



I sat down across from her. She was tracing the edge of her notebook with her thumb.



“You know,” she said, “I didn’t mean to go out like that.”



I raised an eyebrow. “What, detention?”



She looked at me, really looked. Her eyes were glassy but still sharp. Like mirrors with teeth.



“No. I mean... out out.”



I didn’t say anything. I didn’t really want her to keep talking. But she did.



“They said I was unstable. Crazy. Dangerous. I just wanted someone to listen. But they called me names and locked me up and then...”



She flicked ash off an invisible cigarette.



“They forgot me.”



She smiled again, but this one was wrong. Sad, maybe. Or tired.



“I don’t think I’m supposed to be here anymore,” she added. “But this room remembers me.”



The lights flickered.



Then died.



No buzzing. No hum. Just silence, thick and full.



“Cass?” I said.



It was dark, but I saw her silhouette move. Slowly. Like she didn’t want to scare me.



Too late.



I smelled something. Flowers—cheap, crushed. And smoke.



Not fire. Ash. Like something burned out long ago and never stopped smoldering.



I tried to back up, but my legs wouldn’t move. I felt her hand touch mine.



Cold.



Then nothing.



Room 213. Again.



But I didn’t walk in this time.



I was already there.



Same desk. By the window. Same red pen. Same notebook open to a page that kept drawing itself when I wasn't looking.



I’d been here a while.



The door opened.



Footsteps. Familiar ones. Heavier than they used to be, like the hallway weighed more now.



Racheal.



She walked in slow, holding the detention slip like it bit her. Didn’t see me at first—just scanned the room like something smelled weird.



Then she saw me.



Her face twitched. Just a little.



She didn’t say hi.



Didn’t call me BB.



Didn’t ask where my lip gloss was.



She just sat across from me.



I looked up.



Smiled.



“They always leave early,” I said.



“You’ll get used to it.”



Then I went back to drawing.



The flames were softer now.

My therapist and psychiatrist didn’t seem to be interested in helping me so I quit them as well as my medication. I have had depression this past 8 months but nothing crippling. In addition, I haven’t felt any highs. I got a new therapist I really like and she said that I most likely have cPTSD instead of BP2. Today I feel very energized and have had a way better sleep schedule out of nowhere the last 2 days. Idk if it’s just coffee, but I feel good. At the same time I feel raw to a lot of emotions. Grief and joy in a cocktail of emotions. Socially engaging and anxiety over plans I have tonight. 

Does this mix of high and low emotion make sense for you guys? I’m confused if I even have BP2 after what my current therapist told me that she thinks I was misdiagnosed. Now the way I feel has me worried that I wasn’t misdiagnosed. 

TL;DR
I was diagnosed, quit my doctors and meds. Been fine and new therapist thinks I was misdiagnosed. Feeling today like what was described as hypomania. Can’t tell if my current therapist is mistaken. Seeing if my feelings are in line w/ hypomania. ",2,1744661690.0,bipolar2,2,1.0,False

1jz8qrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPC/comments/1jz8qrd/getting_parents_of_young_kids_young_women/,"Getting parents of young kids, young women, caregivers out to vote","As we all know, it can be really tough for women, mostly young women who may be apathetic about government, single parents and caregivers to find time to go vote. Schedules are crazy and voting easily gets tossed to the side despite best efforts to offer multiple options.

I’m wondering if anyone is aware of any community initiatives, grass roots campaigns, or even informal efforts happening across Canada that are working to help more women and parents  and caregivers get to the advance polls? Especially those in shift work or work multiple jobs ? 

Or if anyone is part of something grassroots that’s supporting this?

Examples I am looking for:
	•	Including newcomer women who are not eligible to vote (permanent residents, work visa etc) to help female eligible voters with childcare, transportation, help with after school activities while they go vote between their three jobs or shift work
	•	Movements that offer to buddy up with a friend who fear language barriers or lack of clear voter info at polling stations
	•	Assist if there is no stroller access at polling stations (I assume there is)
	•	Asking daycares to extend their hours on voting days
	•	Ask libraries to extend hours during voting windows to drop off older kids for after school activities on voting days
	•	Offering community carpooling
	•	A movement for voting buddies / girls night out after voting – dressing up for fun in disco, neon, prom dresses
	•	Employers creating friendly voting team challenges or competitions at work
	•	“Vote Cafés” where women can drop in for coffee and info and discuss women’s issues during this election
	•	Neighborhood group walks to polls with signs and music

Would love to hear what you’ve seen in your area—or ideas anyone is doing

Especially anything happening in smaller towns or underserved communities.

Let’s get as many women/parents/ caregivers to the polls!

Thanks in advance!

Wanna grab a coffee with someone? You had to book it in advance, just so it wouldn’t “steal” time from spiritual activities. Thinking about organizing a party with young people? Well, good luck. You’d have to let the elders know: how many people are going? Who exactly is going? Will there be alcohol? Where’s the place? What time does it start? What time does it end?

Even at a JW social event if people were dancing there was a whole other checklist. What kind of music is playing? What are the lyrics saying? What kind of dance moves are people doing? What “spirit” does the music create? What kind of clothes are they dancing in?

Basically, any attempt to have a social life outside of cult-related activities had to be planned like a mini convention. Minimum 2 weeks notice. Elders had to approve. And everyone involved had to behave 100% like a perfect JW.

Now, outside that world, I don’t book life anymore. Everything’s spontaneous. You vibe with someone, you start talking, and next thing you know, you’re hanging out - same day, same week, no rules, no overthinking. Just being human.
