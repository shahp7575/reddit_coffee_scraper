A Complete Guide,"Are you tired of working alone at home or dealing with the distractions of a coffee shop? Do you wish there was a professional, flexible, and cost-effective workspace that fosters productivity and networking? That’s where coworking spaces come in.

Coworking spaces have revolutionized the way freelancers, startups, and even large corporations operate. But what exactly is a coworking space, and how can it benefit you? Let’s dive in.

# 1. The History of Coworking

The concept of coworking dates back to 2005 when Brad Neuberg, a software engineer, created the first official coworking space in San Francisco. However, the idea of shared workspaces existed long before that in various forms, such as business incubators and hacker spaces.

Over the years, coworking spaces have grown exponentially, catering to remote workers, entrepreneurs, and even enterprise-level teams. With the rise of remote work and the gig economy, coworking has become a mainstream solution for professionals worldwide.

# 2. Advantages of Coworking Space

Why do people choose coworking spaces over traditional offices? Here are some key benefits:

* **Cost-Effective**: No need for long-term leases or expensive office setups.
* **Flexibility**: Choose from daily, weekly, or monthly memberships based on your needs.
* **Networking Opportunities**: Work alongside like-minded professionals and potential collaborators.
* **Increased Productivity**: A professional environment minimizes distractions compared to working from home.
* **Access to Amenities**: High-speed internet, meeting rooms, event spaces, and even coffee bars.

Coworking spaces provide the ideal balance of structure and flexibility, making them a perfect alternative to traditional office spaces.

# 3. Disadvantages of Coworking Space

While coworking offers many advantages, there are some downsides:

* **Lack of Privacy**: Open spaces can sometimes be noisy and lack confidentiality.
* **Distractions**: Other people’s conversations and activities might affect focus.
* **Limited Customization**: Unlike a private office, you can't always personalize the space.
* **Cost for Teams**: For larger teams, coworking spaces may become expensive compared to leasing an office.

Despite these drawbacks, many professionals find that the benefits outweigh the downsides.

# 4. Who Uses Coworking Space?

Coworking spaces attract a diverse group of professionals, including:

* **Freelancers & Remote Workers**: Those seeking an affordable and productive work environment.
* **Startups & Entrepreneurs**: Small businesses that need an office without long-term commitments.
* **Corporate Teams**: Companies using coworking spaces for remote or hybrid teams.
* **Consultants & Creatives**: Professionals needing a professional setting for meetings and collaboration.

# 5. The Evolution of Coworking Space: Other Methods of Coworking

Coworking has evolved into different models, including:

* **Niche Coworking Spaces**: Industry-specific spaces (e.g., tech hubs, wellness spaces).
* **On-Demand Coworking**: Pay-as-you-go access to workspaces in multiple locations.
* **Corporate Coworking**: Large companies using coworking spaces for remote teams.

I'm a guy from California that is looking for a boyfriend. I am looking for a long term relationship. Here is some stuff about me. I am a 21 year old guy from California. Am a college student who was majoring in game development, but is now going to be majoring in computer science. Game development is my biggest passion. So naturally I also like video games. My favorite video games at the moment are valorant, Minecraft Java, and rocket league. As for other things I'm into. I'm really into fashion, and music. I love talking about those. And I'm also really into movies and coffee haha. Now as for what I'm looking for. I'm looking for someone who is nice, kind, and sweet. Someone who can help lift me up and share the good times and the bad times with me.

I am a pretty extroverted person, but there are days where i feel a little quiet so i need someone really talkative to get me going, if that even makes sense lol.

As for looks, I'm fine with almost anybody. I'm just not into plus sizes. i would like someone a little older than me, 22+. I'm okay with long distance. Dm me if you are interested!",1,1742796594.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1jik38q,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1jik38q/tried_akka_superbiotics_for_gut_heres_what_really/,Tried Akka Superbiotics for Gut – Here’s What Really Happened,"Alright, so I’ve been seeing **Akka Superbiotics** pop up on a few forums lately, and I figured I’d share my experience since I actually gave it a real shot. I’ll be upfront—I’m not a health expert or a supplement junkie. Just someone who’s been dealing with **on-and-off bloating, low energy**, and general “blah” vibes for the past year or so.

If you're wondering whether this stuff is worth trying, here’s my take—**the good, the not-so-good**, and whether I’ll keep it in my routine going forward.

**Why I Even Looked into Akka Superbiotics**

I’m in my mid-30s, work from home, and try to eat mostly healthy-ish. But despite all that, I felt like my body wasn’t running as it should. Every afternoon around 2 or 3 pm, I’d hit a wall. Energy gone. Brain fog. Constantly reaching for caffeine. Also, I’d get bloated randomly—even from things like oatmeal or eggs.

At first, I chalked it up to stress or not enough sleep. But then I started seeing info about how your **liver and gut** work together, and if your liver’s backed up, your digestion and metabolism can suffer. That’s when I came across **Akka Superbiotics**, which claims to support both.

What caught my eye? It includes **Akkermansia**, a probiotic strain I hadn’t heard of before. Apparently, it plays a major role in gut lining and metabolism—not something most probiotics focus on. So I figured… why not?

**How I Used It + What I Noticed**

I took **Akka once a day in the morning with water**, usually before breakfast. Nothing fancy.

**Week 1:**  
Honestly, not much changed right away. If anything, I felt a little more “regular,” if you know what I mean. No side effects. No bloating. But also no huge shift yet.

**Week 2-3:**  
This is when I started noticing real changes. The random bloating I was getting after meals—especially carbs—was way less. I wasn’t unbuttoning my jeans by 4pm like before. My energy also seemed more stable, and I didn’t feel the need to slam a second cup of coffee by lunchtime.

Also weird: my cravings for sugar/snacking kinda dropped. I didn’t expect that, but it’s been a welcome bonus.

**Week 4 and onward:**  
The biggest win has been **consistency**. Digestion feels smoother overall. My energy doesn’t crash as hard, and I’m actually feeling a bit lighter. Not in a weight-loss-magic kind of way, but like my body’s running cleaner. Hard to explain, but if you’ve dealt with gut issues, you’ll get it.

**What’s in Akka (And What Makes It Different)**

So besides **Akkermansia**, it also has things like **Quercetin, Silymarin**, and **Resveratrol**. I did some reading, and apparently these are helpful for **inflammation, liver support**, and cell repair. It’s not just a gut fix—it’s more of a whole-body reset.

If you're curious, here's one of the pages I found helpful:  
[**Akka full info & blend breakdown**](https://dailywellnesscare.com/pages/dwc-akk-tsl?_ef_transaction_id=&oid=22&uid=33&oid=22&affid=80&source_id=&guaffid=8928&guoid=1041&uid=2376&guoid=1041&guaffid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

**What I Liked Most**

* **Bloating is almost gone** (that alone is worth it to me)
* Energy feels more even throughout the day
* No weird side effects or crash like I’ve had with other supplements
* It targets both gut and liver, not just one

**What I Didn’t Love**

* It’s not cheap—definitely an investment
* You have to be patient; it’s not a magic pill
* You still have to eat decently for it to really shine

**Would I Recommend It?**

If you’re struggling with bloating, low energy, or digestion stuff that’s hard to pin down, **Akka Superbiotics might be worth trying**. It’s not an overnight fix, but it does build up over time. You just have to stick with it.

And no, I don’t think it replaces eating clean or exercising—but it’s helped support everything I’m already doing. If you’re someone who’s tried a bunch of generic probiotics and been disappointed, this one feels different.

If you want to check it out, here’s the link I used:

**Bottom Line:**  
Akka didn’t *wow* me in the first couple of days, but I’m glad I stuck with it. I feel more balanced, less bloated, and more clear-headed. For now, it’s earned a spot on my shelf.

Commute is not important. I am a runner, and we also like to go to the gym.  We have lived in Germany, several Canadian cities, have spent time in Seattle, DC, and Honolulu and have always been carfree.  As I have not been to SF yet (DH has for a few days), we would like some input from locals as to what neighborhood might be a good match for us.  We intend to spend some time visiting soon, but would be good to have a few places to start.

We need the following to be walkable within 15 minutes:

Grocery store
Gym
Park/trails (for running)
Bonus if there are coffee shops/bakeries

Access to transit would be cool too.

Our budget is no more than $5,000/mth for rent. 

I’ve picked around Google maps a bit - looks like Pacific Heights/Haight and Ashbury might be a good fit, but not always easy to tell.  Many of the neighborhoods near the parks appear to be single detached housing and very residential…

I just ordered the Cafec Deep 27 and. 200 filters from RogueWave Coffee, along with three 40g sample bags of coffee. 

I got the brewer for $16.00 and the filters for $7.00 per hundred. The samples were around $3.00 to $4.00 each. 

I mention the prices because someone here complained that the filters cost $15.00. Also, the Deep 27 was $25.00 on Amazon. Plus RogueWave Coffee offers free shipping for orders on order of $30.00 it more. 

 Basically, because of currency differences and market forces, this is almost half of what Amazon charges. 

Plus I want to support our northern friends and neighbors during some trying times. 
Win/Win. 

I just started doing business with RogueWave last month at the urging of some fellow redditors and have to say I have been VERY happy with their coffees, service and prices. (If the person who recommended them to me reads this, thank you. Please PM me or say hi here )

I ordered this brewer specifically for.  maximizing the yield I can get from small samples bags and remnants of sometimes relatively expensive specialty coffee - you know, when you have a good bag but  only have 7 or 8 grams left.

I can only get about 2 brews from a 40g sample bag, using my conventional brewers, maybe excepting the B75.  It looks like I might realistically get 6 or 7 brews with the Deep 27.

Anyway  that's how I justified succumbing to my latest GAS attack for a new brewer.

World domination, Shark Tank glory, and crores in the bank…all in your head, of course. Aja bhai, let’s burst that bubble faster than you can say “unicorn.” Most startup ideas…like yours, probably—suck harder than you jhaag of cold coffee . Why? Because you’re high on passion but low on logic, and your “original” brainwave is just Zomato for parathas or some equally thanda concept. Let’s break down why your startup is doomed, with a side of sarcasm, some Hinglish spice, and a real-life flop to seal the deal.

# 1. Market Research? Yeh Kya Hoti Hai?

You didn’t bother googling if anyone even wants your product, did you? “Arre, log toh khud samajh jayenge it’s awesome,” you say, sipping your cutting chai. Newsflash: Customers don’t care about your dreams—they care about their problems. No research means you’re blindly throwing darts in the dark, hoping to hit a bullseye that doesn’t exist.

**Example**: Meet Vikrant, who thought a “chai subscription” app would kill it. No one told him people already have chaiwallahs on speed dial. Result? App downloaded by his mom and two cousins. Total revenue: ₹50.

**Skill You’re Missing**: Data-driven thinking. Without it, you’re just a dreamer with a dud.

# 2. “Bas Passion Hai”—Aur Kuch Nahi

Passion is great for Instagram captions, but it won’t pay your bills, bhai. You’re so in love with your idea—say, artisanal jalebis delivered by drone—that you forgot to ask: Can this make money? Passion without a plan is like a Bollywood hero without a script—lots of drama, zero sense.

**Example**: Priya’s “vegan laddoo” startup sounded cute till she realized her target audience was 0.001% of India and shipping costs ate her alive. Passion ka overdose, profit ka drought.

**Skill You’re Missing**: Business acumen. Love your idea, but make it rain cash too, na?

# 3. Copy-Paste Vibes: Zomato for XYZ

Your big idea is just someone else’s success with a different topping. “Zomato for parathas,” “Swiggy for socks,” “Uber for rickshaws”—bore ho gaya yaar! Copying works only if you do it better, not if you slap a new label on it and call it “disruptive.” Spoiler: It’s not.

**Example**: Rohan’s “Flipkart for handmade soaps” tanked because—surprise—people don’t need a fancy app for a ₹20 bar. Originality score: -10.

**Skill You’re Missing**: Innovation. Stop remixing old hits and write your own song.

# 4. Execution? Plan Kahan Hai, Bhai?

You’ve got the idea, but no clue how to make it happen. Team? Funding? Marketing? “Dekha jayega,” you mumble, while doodling your logo on a napkin. Startups don’t run on vibes and Wi-Fi—they need a roadmap, not your “chhota sa dream” speech.

**Example**: Sanjay’s “fitness tracker for cows” sounded quirky, but he had no tech guy, no investors, and no farmers who cared. Idea stayed on paper, cows stayed unfit.

**Skill You’re Missing**: Execution strategy. Ideas are cheap; making them work is the real hustle.

# Famous Failed Startup: PepperTap ka Tamasha

Time for some real-world masala. PepperTap, a grocery delivery startup, raised $50 million with big desi dreams—think Swiggy for veggies. Launched in 2015, they promised 30-minute deliveries and expanded like crazy. Sounds sexy, right? Except they burned cash faster than a politician at election time, ignored small-town logistics nightmares, and didn’t figure out if aunties actually wanted carrots delivered to their doorstep. By 2016, they shut shop, proving that even a “hot” idea can flop if you don’t research, plan, or execute worth a damn.

**What We Learn**: PepperTap’s bosses had passion (check), but no grip on costs, customer needs, or scalability. Your startup’s heading the same way if you think “bas ho jayega” is a strategy. Overexpansion, zero profits, and a fancy app won’t save you—ask PepperTap’s ghost.

# Abhi Bhi Chance Hai, Sudhar Jao b@sd#i//@L0

So, there it is…your startup idea sucks because you skip research, overdose on passion, copy-paste like a Xerox machine, and have no execution game. You’re not the next Elon Musk; you’re the next “yeh kyun band ho gaya” story. Take a lesson from Vikrant, Priya, Rohan, Sanjay, and PepperTap: Get real, get smart, or get ready to fail spectacularly. Chal, ab soch lo…either fix your idea or stick to daydreaming over chai. The startup world doesn’t need another paratha delivery app, yaar!

I was initially premature when born and lived with My grandparents for 5 years before going to live with my mom, dad, and sister whos a year older.

This place wasn't exactly an healthy environment growing up for a child. My dad was abusive to my mom which in turn lead to my mom sometimes lashing out. My mom didn't hurt me or anything but said really hurtful things, things a kid shouldn't be told. The 2 most hurtful were my mom saying she'd blow my head off with then turn the gun on herself. My dad was standing next her, laughing whilr my mom was crying. The 2nd being my mom calling me a mistake she said sorry afterwards but that didn't make it hurt any less. My sister isn't much better. My dad basically spoiled my sister with everything she wanted. This resulted in my sister hurting me a lot. This began as early as I started living in the same house as her. I know this because when I was 5, me and my sister were messing around with recording on our mom's laptop. 
Which recording my sister hurting me for making too much noise, which was laughing apparently. 

In any case, my sister yelled and beat me up when I did anything she didn't like. This even extended small stuff like breathing ""weirdly"" or smiling. She even smashed this small tablet I played on to pieces when I was paying more attention to the tablet than her talking. My sister ended up making me take the blame but my mom used warranty or insurance or something and got the tablet replaced which ironically had better capabilities much to my sister's disdain.

This reached breaking points where'd I'd rarely defend myself to which my sister responded with by pinning my arms down while she hitted me. My dad didn't care and i think may even have thought it was funny. My mom did try to do something but it was just her chasing my sister away, sometimes hitting once. My sister sometimes threatened to murder me multiple times if I didn't listen to her.
One other thing that happened was that my sister tripped me and I landed on the corner of something, with my face. Thankfully I hit right below my right eye so my eye is fine but still got taken to the eye doctor to check things out. For some reason my sister made me lie to mom so I get glasses and me being scared of my sister , listened. My mom ended up wasting money on glasses I didn't need and because I was forced to use glasses, my eyesight became worse. I don't use glasses anymore but the damage was done. My sister also constantly belittled me. It was just constant. My sister also made it a thing to constantly be in my room everyday.

This continued all the way until she graduated high-school. My sister is ""nice"" sometimes but is very, very easily angered. I believe the only reason she stopped treating me that way she did was because she got flooded with college responsibilities. She also rarely goes in my room unless to tell something mom or dad said. She made many enemies in college. And when I say enemies, I just mean people who don't like her. 

Whenever I bring up how my sister treated me to my sister, she gets mad, downplays what happened, or says it never happened. My sister even blames some of it on me.

Moving on to my dad, he's no better. He's worse. My dad as said before, was and is still abusive to my mom. Beated her regularly and dropped all child caring responsibilities to her. Eventually, my dad met another woman, cheated on my mom and slept with this woman, and then had a child. He initially hid this woman, having her stay at his mom's house, which he planned to sell. This woman who I'll call affair for simplicity was eventually found out. My dad's mother and my mom got passed and rightly so. But unfortunately my dad's mother passed not too long after. After this though, my dad just moved affair into the same house as my mom. My mom got mad but couldn't do anything. There was no where my mom could go with two children. At around age 10,  my sister was molested by my dad and my mom walked in on him. My dad got pissed at my mom and chased her downstairs. My sister not understanding what happened at the time still cozied up against dad and even got mom beat up after mom said to tell her if dad ever tries anything again. Though after understanding somewhat, she anonymously told CPS but they were useless. My dad got mad but my sister managed to pin it on dad's friend. 

Dad is also just plain disgusting. The guy shits the bed and makes mom clean it and pisses all over the floor when leaving the bathroom. Dad even casually walked around with his dick out. He, over time stopped doing this, except pissing on the floor for some reason. 

My dad abused my mom to the point that all the stressed caused a hole to open up in an important vein to her heart. She thankfully lived but doctors said that she can't be stressed out or drink coffee. This forced my dad to stop beating mom up. But my dad did blame all this on my sister and somehow thinks this isn't his fault whatsoever. My dad still gets in bad arguments with mom but doesn't lay hands on her anymore. This was around highschool, maybe towards the end of it.

As for affair, they're just an asshole. Condensending, rude, and just insufferable. The half sister though was just as mean but only to me until she got older. Everyone thinks she's ""changed"" when she's always been like that, just no to them. My half sister's personality is the combination of the worst traits of dad and affair. And because half sister is around, my dad stopped spoiling my sister, half sister became terrible but I don't spend anytime with nor her with me. Although half-sister has changed schools multiple times. From her words, everyone is mean to her but I heard she's been mean to people and even racist. 

The most stupid thing about all of this is that my dad technically did very little to me since he didn't want anything to do with me at all. Wanted my mom to abort me when he learned my gender, didn't even want to sign his name on my birth certificate. My dad did buy me gifts on birthdays Christmases but acted high and mighty about it. My dad once got pissed at my grandfather(on mom's side) that he bought me a MacBook and thought he was trying to ""be better than him"". This got to the point where my grandfather then did a phonecall to just confirming my dad just to stop my dad from being pissed. 

Things are calm now, or calm-ish. Dad is still an asshole, sister is still an asshole but both don't get physical anymore. My mom is doing better.

Things are still shit but aren't as bad as they were. Though, I don't think I'll speak much to family once I graduate college and get my own place.

I haven’t had the opportunity to tell my story or be transparent anywhere and I’m encouraged by joining this group and reading about others experiences. I’m going to just jump in. 

I’m 47F and almost 500lbs. Im 5’8”. I wasn’t always overweight. My obesity stems from trauma, injuries, yo-yo weight loss and bearing children. I was thin until my thirties. In fact, I was 120lbs for several years. I wasn’t the thinnest girl in school, which some school mates and friends liked to joke about and remind me of, but looking back I marvel at how fat I thought I was as a result of those people and their opinions. I was bullied by several girls, one in particular that was just beautiful and popular- about my appearance and home life, etc….. I look back at my photos now and I’m shocked at how lovely I was.

I definitely had an incredibly dysfunctional childhood (thats not what this is about) and an unhealthy relationship with food. My Mom was chronically ill and in the hospital a ton until she died (I was a teen when she did) and we ate total crap and fast food often. I’m not mad about it; my parents had their own stuff and did what they could and we didn’t starve. As a late teen and early adult I smoked and worked and basically lived off coffee and nicotine. I didn’t know how to cook- had never been taught- and I was a busy bee and loved my trips and night clubs. I essentially didn’t eat normally for 20+ years.

Fast forward to my early thirties. I quit smoking, had 2 babies within a year, developed some health issues and went through a terribly abusive 9 year marriage and divorce. LOTS of weight gain. I developed what I believe is in an eating disorder as a coping mechanism for abuse. I still have it. I left that marriage in 2012 almost 300lbs and was over 300
when the divorce was finalized. 

As an already overweight adult I went through many unsuccessful diets. Would lose 50, gain back 80. One stressful trauma or cheat meal was all it took and I would fall off the wagon and back on the binge, over and over.

Several years ago I fell and tore my meniscus. I live(d) in chronic pain. My activity dramatically slowed. I compensated on my other knee. Now it’s failing from compensation. Activity slows. Pain increases. I work a physical job (two actually). It’s difficult. I don’t have the type
of employment that allows for extended time off for surgeries. I don’t have insurance that covers the weight loss injectables.

I’ve become massively depressed. Low to no self-care, etc. Tv and Sleep is all I want outside of work. I mask really well for work  (self/employed, work on my feet with the public) and friends and when I have to but I just don’t want to live like this; I’m in constant pain, I can’t get comfortable (back, knees, joints- especially when I stand) and I hate the way I look. My personal life is incredibly challenging and I have a lot of plates I’m constantly spinning and a lot of people rely on my solely. I also am really self-deprecating and the clown for other people so I can diffuse what I assume they are thinking….as I find a lot of overweight people are. Making change with the obstacles I’m facing feels impossible, and I also get really deflated when I think of the issues after with skin. 

I would love any words of encouragement, thoughts, anything. I do have a counselor and have tried many things. Thank you so much! It was so relieving to type all of that. ",4,1742794050.0,SuperMorbidlyObese,1,0.83,False

I’m reaching out to this community for some advice and insights. I’ve been hosting my rental property in Northern Norway for a few months now, and while it’s been a rewarding experience overall, I’ve encountered some significant challenges—particularly with Booking.com.
First, let me share a bit about my hosting approach. My companion and I spent last year renovating the house, and we’ve put our hearts into creating a warm, welcoming space for our guests. We take pride in offering exceptional hospitality: deep cleaning after every stay, ironing bedsheets, providing high-quality linens and towels, and fully stocking the kitchen with essentials, including a selection of teas and coffee. We want every guest to feel at home and have a memorable stay.  
However, the reality of hosting hasn’t always matched our expectations. While we’ve had some wonderful guests, we’ve also had a few groups who left the house in unimaginable condition. Think soaked carpets, scratches on brand-new doors and cabinets, a broken sofa, burn marks on a pristine white dining table, and even snowmen built indoors on our wooden floors. These incidents have been deeply frustrating, especially given the high cost of repairs and replacements in Northern Norway, where prices for basic materials and labor are already sky-high.  
What’s even more disheartening is Booking.com’s response!!!or lack thereof. Despite providing clear evidence of the damages, their representatives have been unresponsive and unhelpful, often sending automated replies stating they’re not responsible. It’s been a frustrating experience, and I’m at the end of my patience with the platform.😭
That said, most of my bookings still come through Booking.com, so I’m in a bit of a dilemma. I want to slowly transition away from the platform, but I also want to ensure that future guests see me as a trustworthy and dedicated host. I’m already listed on other platforms, but I’d love to hear your thoughts on how to:  
1. Gradually reduce reliance on Booking.com while maintaining a steady flow of bookings.  
2. Build trust and credibility with potential guests directly or through other platforms.  
3. Protect my property!! from future damages without compromising the welcoming atmosphere I strive to create.  

If you’ve been in a similar situation or have advice on how to navigate this, I’d greatly appreciate your insights. Hosting has been a passion project for me, and I want to continue providing a high-quality experience for my guests—just without the headaches that have come with certain bookings.

I haven't been to the doctor for years, and I know I should go there instead of asking strangers on the internet.

Some possible important info: I was AFAB (assigned female at birth) and am a young adult. As far as I know, I'm mostly healthy, but have a poor diet and exercise regimen and many terrible habits, but I don't consume coffee, alcohol, drugs, cigarettes or vape. I've never been sexually active with another person.

But.. I just had some questions and wanted to know if anybody else has similar problems.

I'm in my early 20s, so I've been having this issue since i was a teenager. I've always had some sort of urinary problem. Since i was a kid I have dealt with paruresis (shy bladder) and it comes and goes. I'm thinking years of holding it has culminated in a weak pelvic floor and a weak bladder, possibly distended? My paruresis has improved over the past few years though. I can use any public restroom with only a little hesitance from my body.

Strange thing is, when I'm not at home i have no problem holding it. The urge to pee is gradual and doesn't spring on me like it does at home. I have a ""normal bladder"" when outside the house.

I'm either really good at blocking out my body's signals or there's a loose connection between my bladder and brain. I haven't had a full on accident in a long time though, where I would lose nearly full control and have soaked pants. Now, I usually have only dribbles and occasionally I will have to change underwear, but it mostly stops there and I can get to the bathroom before it gets worse.

Sometimes i get the ""latchkey incontinence"" when I go in the bathroom, i may have only seconds to prevent a mess. Sometimes I can take my time even though i'm bursting. I also noticed something. I feel like I've properly emptied myself when I'm in a public restroom, like my body feels fresher and satisfied? It's weird. Sometimes if i hold it too long at home, I will get bladder cramps after I relieve myself, and they don't go away for a while. It's like my body picks and chooses to torture me.

Other than going to the doctor, which I can't afford right now, what do I do? Advice is very appreciated, thank you very much in advance. Sorry this post is a scrambled mess.

It’s also good to note she would walk by when I’m nearby but when I approached her she was always open to talk. But the thing is we haven’t spoken since we last saw each other which is going to be a year ago. 

I first saw her at a mall and I saw her and her friends and I waved at her but she kept walking like nothing happened. Then I ran into her & her friends in college campus, she was staring at me but when they got a little too close she looked away and kept walking. And I saw her look back a couple times after they passed by. I find her staring at me sometimes when we’re in the same area, even times she’s sat nearby with her friends but she never reached out. Only time we’ve spoken was when she was standing in line for coffee and I asked if she was in line and she said no quietly and then she walked away. 

My main question is if she no longer interested? We talked fine last year but now she walks as if we never met.

Mia was the ringleader of an all boys clique involving dean liam and jordan. max too probably bc her and max are extremelyyyyy close thats why during the turkey task they woke up early and had coffee alone together ",4,1742793585.0,apprenticeuk,3,0.75,False

Yuuka straddled him in his chair, hands braced against his shoulders, face flushed redder than her tie, but her expression pure domination.

“You’re gonna remember this every time you taste coffee again,” she whispered, biting his neck between gasps.

“Y-Yuuka—” he tried to speak, but she silenced him with another thrust.

“Shut up,” she hissed. “You don’t get to talk. Just moan.”

His body obeyed. The aphrodisiac still throbbed in his veins.

Her movements were fast. Sharp. Unrelenting.
Like she was trying to correct every fantasy she ever had of being on top of him.

And then—

The door opened.

Click.

“Oh, hey Sen—”

Mika froze.

Sensei and Yuuka froze.

But the plaps didn’t stop right away. Yuuka was mid-thrust when the door creaked open, and the noise echoed like a gunshot in the silence that followed.

Mika blinked once.

Twice.

Her eye twitched.

Yuuka, without looking back, smirked over her shoulder.

“Well well~ Someone’s late to the party.”

“…You,” Mika said, stepping inside slowly, her voice like sugar dipped in cyanide. “You drugged him and didn’t invite me?”

“I don’t share,” Yuuka said, hips still grinding slowly into Sensei, just to prove a point.

Sensei whimpered.

Mika kicked the door shut.

“Then I guess I’ll just take my turn when you’re done,” she said, slipping her jacket off. “Or maybe I’ll just ride his face while you’re still busy being selfish.”

“Try it, and I’ll throw you out the window,” Yuuka snapped, her movements picking back up.

Mika just laughed, walking up and crouching beside them, hand sliding dangerously up Sensei’s trembling thigh.

“You really thought you could keep him all to yourself, Yuuka~?” she purred, licking her lips. “Too bad. You’re not the only one who loves him.”

Sensei gasped.

Mika and Yuuka locked eyes over his flushed, overwhelmed, pleasure-drunk face.

My life makes me laugh a little. It's always busy in my life. Most people would say ""time management"" is what you need to work on. My serious answer would be maybe, just maybe, some people just have too much that needs to be accomplished for being one person. I giggled a little with my top statement. I am just a really busy person, is all. 

I woke up to hurrying to send out photos and videos of the accident. I'm telling my kiddo to hurry and shower while I get stuff accomplished. I sent a message to my leads to let them know I wouldn't be coming into work and  messaged my boss to let her know I have my car going in and a rental that I need to pick up. I didn't share the secret interview I will be having tomorrow. That's my secret. I messaged a lady to let her know the company she contracted never gave the insurance information, and I that would need to be done because my car is going in tomorrow. My insurance is going to be going up because the company hasn't shared their insurance information. They were clearly at fault for it because my car was parked and they hit it. The issue is that it wasn't a car that hit me. It was something way bigger... more like a tractor. I got a video of it, so they can't really say they didn't hit my parked car. It is what it is, but I do want them to pay for the damage and the rentals.

I had to run to work because one of my employees messaged me late at night requesting off. I needed to drop by work to ensure she could have the day. I only allow a certain amount of employees off at a time. I showered. Started a load of laundry to have that done when I got back home. Packed up the stuff for the visit with my mom and headed to work to check the calendar. It was a decent day out when I left. Stopped at the grocery store and got my mom some food so we could cook dinner together for her. On our last phone call, she told me how she enjoyed when I would bring her snacks at the nursing home. I figured I would make her some meals that I used to cook for her when she would come over for the weekends and get her the snacks. 

We had a nice time together. I didn't do the pot painting because it started to snow really bad out. We food prepped 3 containers of food. We made marinated chicken, red parmesan mashed potatoes, and cheddar cheese and broccoli rice. She helped me cook and started to melt the containers on the stove. I had her making the mashed potatoes, and I told her she needed to portion out the potatoes in the one section. She moved the potato pot to the cold burner and placed the plastic container on the stove. We were able to fix it, and I caught it in time. I also took another batch of raw chicken and marinated it and placed that in the freezer. When she pulls it out and dethaws it, it will be already to go for cooking. I bought her gyros because she likes those as well. She has a red onion and some tomatoes to places in the inside of them when she is ready to cook them. 

I got her, her favorite instant hazelnut coffee, and she had two cups while I was there. She really loves that instant coffee. She didn't like the pure cranberry I got her for the UTI, so I got her some cran apple. Hopefully, she likes that more. I did get her breakfast foods as well, her snacks, and nutrition shakes for all the weight loss. Overall I think we had a nice visit. My mom and I on the weekends that she came over, we would hang out in the kitchen. She liked when I would make her dinner and she would wash the dishes. This was before she got really unstable with her illness. Today, we bonded with cooking and cleaning. The staff didn't seem to like that I came in with food. When I got to the kitchen I was very surprised. They're to be feeding her, and their was barely any food. They had a carton of eggs, gallon of milk, oat meals, and large instant mashed potatoes and two boxes of cereal. They also had cat food that was open and no cat. 

My opinion is something strange is going on with the place. The amount my mother pays isn't mathing for the place to be able to do what they're doing. Example: My mom's rent is $1,000 a month. I know this because I am over her finances. I have a rep payee who takes care of the bills, but I have to have statements on where her social security goes. She gets a weekly allowance of $100. Anyways my mom is the only person living there. They rent the place. Have 24-hour staff. They supply the food, rides to Dr appointments, and her washing supplies. Rent around here is $600 to $1,000. This means they're clearly in the negative. There is no way they're not. You can't pay 24-hour staffing on $1000 a month. No one I know can live on $1000 a month in this economy, and now, if you split that for 3 employees, it isn't adding up. That means each of these employees is making $333 a month as a full-time job. 

It explains to me why they have 17 year old boy's watching my mom. They can't find anyone to pay that small of an amount. I have also thought of other reasons this business is running, and it is concerning. They seem nice, but something still seems off. Anyways, off that topic. 
We cooked dinner together, and I painted her nails and my daughters. Regardless of what is up, her and I had a good visit. Okay, what I think it is is a business that is run by immigrants. The community of immigrants helps keep it running, and the families help to keep it going. That is why they're negative. I don't mind as long as they're caring for her. I don't mind paying for her groceries and bathroom supplies. I think the business is struggling. I figured buy the food and her bathroom supplies to ensure she is eating properly and clean. I don't want her having any infections. I did give my mom cash. She didn't know where her uncashed checks went, so I just gave her 100 to make sure she had what she needed or for going out. 

When I left, it was a really bad blizzard. It was so bad that I had to pull over to clear the snow from my headlights because it was packed so much that their was no light on the road. I couldn't see at all. Traffic was really jammed up. I should end this because I have food to put away and laundry to change over. ",1,1742793216.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False

I can’t recall the exact date. We had moved from Worcester, MA to Lantana, FL right after my high school graduation. I think the graduation ceremony was within the first two weeks of June. We were staying with my aunt in Lantana. My mom who was a night owl always liked to go for a ride after the sunset. I remember we were on either military trail or congress blvd. We stopped at a Dunkin’ Donuts got some coffees and kept driving either north or south. I remember seeing the airport to my right. My mom was driving, we took a right turn and I could see the runways and control tower on my right. The road had 3 lanes on each side. In front of us and on the left side of the road we saw a “triangular” object with purple “lights”. It was almost more of a hue or glow than actual lights. It had 3 smaller lights on its corners and one larger light in the center. It was hovering over a house or house like structure as we weren’t familiar with the area and it was dark. The object was rotating clockwise and there was a helicopter hovering near it with its spotlight pointed at it. It seemed as though the object absorbed the light from the helicopter and there was no reflection at all. I’m not even sure if the object itself was triangular or just the lights were in a triangle pattern. The object then started to move slowly across the road in the direction of the airport. Once it crossed over the fence line it increased in speed and took off over the control tower and was gone out of sight in less than a few seconds.",0,1742792761.0,aliens,1,0.5,False

-------------------------------------------------------------

Crockpot Christmas Crack with pretzels is a festive treat that combines sweet and salty flavors, making it a favorite during the holiday season. But why stop at the classic recipe? There are numerous creative variations you can try to make this holiday snack even more delightful. Here are some fun twists to put on your Crockpot Christmas Crack.

### Pumpkin Spice Delight

For a taste of autumn blended with holiday cheer, add pumpkin spice to your mixture. You can easily achieve this by mixing in 1-2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice along with your brown sugar and butter. The warm flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg complement the sweetness and saltiness perfectly.

### Minty Fresh Chocolate

If you love mint, consider incorporating mint chocolate chips. During the last few minutes of cooking, sprinkle about a cup of these chips into your mixture. The cooling flavor of mint will elevate your Crockpot Christmas Crack, giving it a refreshing taste that pairs well with the crunchy pretzels.

### Nutty Crunch

Add texture and depth by mixing in a variety of nuts. Try using chopped pecans, walnuts, or even almonds. Not only do they provide an extra crunch, but nuts also add healthy fats to your holiday treat. Mix them in during the last hour of cooking for the best flavor and texture.

### Peanut Butter Bliss

For peanut butter lovers, swirl in some creamy or crunchy peanut butter into your melted mixture. It adds a rich, nutty flavor that perfectly complements the sweetness of the sugars and the saltiness of the pretzels. Just ensure to monitor the proportions to maintain the right balance.

### Festive Color

Add a splash of color to your Crockpot Christmas Crack by tossing in some festive red and green candies, like M&amp;Ms or holiday sprinkles. This not only makes your treat more visually appealing but also adds a fun, candy-coated crunch that kids love.

### Coconut Surprise** For a tropical twist, consider adding shredded coconut to your Crockpot Christmas Crack. The coconut adds a chewy texture and a subtle sweetness, which pairs nicely with the caramelized pretzels. You can add about half a cup of coconut during the last cooking phase.

### Dark Chocolate Drizzle

Enhance your treat with a drizzle of dark chocolate. Once your Christmas Crack has cooled and set, melt some dark chocolate and drizzle it over the top. The richness of dark chocolate complements the buttery mixture and gives it an elegant touch, perfect for holiday parties.

### Spicy Kick

If you prefer a bit of a kick, try adding cayenne pepper or chili powder to your mixture. Just a pinch (1/8 teaspoon) can transform your sweet treat into something exciting and unexpected. The spice balances the sweetness beautifully while tantalizing your taste buds.

### Caramelized Apples

Transform your treat into a cozy dessert by adding caramelized apples. Sauté diced apples in butter and brown sugar until they are soft. Mix them into the crockpot when you're almost done cooking. This adds a delicious fruity flavor that screams fall and winter celebrations.

### Serving Suggestions

When creating these delicious variations of Crockpot Christmas Crack, remember to let the mixture cool completely before breaking it into pieces. This will ensure a nice crunchy texture. Here are a few suggestions for serving them:

These quirky little figures are more than just toys. They capture personality, style, and memories in a fun, bobbling way that always gets a smile. Whether it’s for a birthday, wedding, retirement, or just because, personalized bobble heads are guaranteed to impress. Here's how to make sure your order is a hit!

# 1. Start with a Clear Idea

Before placing your order, have a vision. Who is the bobble head for? Is it going to mimic someone’s work outfit, a favorite sports jersey, or maybe a superhero costume? Getting clear on the purpose and theme helps in choosing the right style and customizing it perfectly. The more specific your concept, the better the final result.

# 2. Use High-Quality Photos

A custom bobble head is only as good as the photo you provide. Choose a picture that clearly shows the face, hairstyle, and any unique features like facial hair, glasses, or expressions. A high-resolution, front-facing photo with good lighting gives the artist the best chance to capture the likeness accurately. Want a bonus tip? Including side profile shots helps nail the 3D effect even more!

# 3. Focus on the Details

What makes a bobble head really stand out is the detail. You can usually customize everything from hair and eye color to outfit, accessories, and even pose. Some services allow for personalization down to the shoes and base design. Think about what represents the person best—do they have a signature look? A favorite coffee mug? A funny quirk? Little touches like these can make the figure feel incredibly lifelike.

# 4. Understand the Process and Timeline

Creating a bobble head isn’t instant magic—it’s handcrafted art. Depending on complexity and customization level, it can take several weeks to produce and ship. So, plan ahead! Especially if it's for a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary. Some providers may offer express service, but standard timelines are typically around 3-5 weeks from order to delivery.

# 5. Approve the Proofs Carefully

Most custom bobble head creators offer preview images or proofs before the final product is made. Take this step seriously. It’s your chance to request changes and ensure the figure looks just right. Don’t rush through this part—check the face, clothing details, pose, and anything else that was important to you during the planning phase.

# 6. Make it Memorable

Want to take your gift up a notch? Pair it with a little note or inside joke. You can even create a mini scene around it, like a desk display or small platform that matches a hobby or environment the person loves. It's those added layers of thought that turn a great gift into an unforgettable one.

In a world full of generic gifts, standing out matters—and that’s exactly what personalized bobble heads deliver. They’re thoughtful, funny, and most importantly, one-of-a-kind. Whether you're celebrating someone’s big milestone or just want to bring some light-hearted joy to their day, this custom collectible is a sure way to wow.",1,1742792466.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

It's good that you have gotten a job; you can stay with us as long as you want. He cut the call and informed me; I also felt happy as he had finally gotten a job.

I said, For now, no, and he sat on the kitchen shelf, and we both started to talk. Finally, he came back near me and hugged me from behind. I was in shock, and I said, What are you doing? Leave me; I will give you one slap. If you don't leave, he did not listen to it, and he continued to hug me and started to confess feelings to me that I like you, aunty; for a few years, I have been in love with you. In fact, I selected my work location to be in this city just because I wanted to be with you. By listening to this, I was in shock and started to push him, but he turned me around and hugged me and gave me a kiss. That kiss just awakened my lust as I reduced my force of pushing him away, and he started to kiss and hug me. Finally I stopped completely pushing him, but I kept saying in my mouth that this is bad, this is wrong, but he did not listen to it, and he took me to the bedroom and he removed both of our clothes and asked me If there is any protection present in-house I pointed at drawer where me and my husband keep condomes and he opend it and wore one and come on top of me, I was completly lost and finally that day everything happend between us But I felt bad about his and I said to him this is first and last I am married women and I am your aunty this cannot happend and I dressed my self up and went outside and I was still trying to digest what happend and at night my hushand came and I was silent he asked if everything is ok I said yes there is no issue there is just little stress at work thats it and my newphew also came to dinner and we both ignored eye contact and after dinner he went to his room and we went to ours and In morning after my husband went to office I also started work but as there was not much work I started to watch TV and my nephew also joined I asked did you complete your work he said yes its all done and after that we had luch and after luch he hugged me again I said, I told you that was first and last. What are you doing? Leave me by saying that I try to push him, but he ignored me and started to hug me. I also lost again, and he carried me to his room in his arms and placed me in his bed and came on top of me, and again, the second time, we both slept together. On the third day also, he started to kiss me. I said today it is not possible; I have a meeting now, so he took me to my room only, and after I joined those meetings, he made me turn off the camera and mic and then took me in his arms and placed me in bed, and we both enjoyed it like this. This continued as whenever we had less work, we both stayed in bed all day, but if we had to, we did one quick session and got back to work. We both even got very close, but my husband did not doubt us. We both even started to go out for movies and shopping, and one day my mother-in-law came to our house for a few days at that time, and we both somehow managed to be together as we convinced my mother-in-law that we had to work in a single room because the internet connection was strong here, and she also believed that we used to lock the room door to start our business. I even asked my husband to let our nephew stay with us only because that will save his salary and it will give us company too; he also instantly agreed, and from that day he has been with us, and I feel scared sometimes. What if my husband or our family gets to know about him? But that is worth the risk for the fun we both are having.",3,1742792425.0,DeepIndianConfessions,1,1.0,False
1jij59o,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/1jij59o/need_advice_after_the_most_embarrassing_lecture/,Need advice after the most embarrassing lecture of my life,"I'm a 2B student and I don't think I can ever show my face in class again after what happened today. I'm genuinely looking for advice on how to handle this situation professionally.
So last night I made the rookie mistake of getting 10 lines at Lazeez after grinding on my lab report until 2am. I was starving and it seemed like a good idea at the time. My roommate warned me not to get the extra garlic sauce, but I was like whatever man. Fast forward to this morning and I wake up feeling a bit off but decide to power through and attend my 8:30am  lecture.

About 30 minutes into the lecture, I start feeling some serious rumbling in my stomach. I'm sitting there trying to focus while my intestines are playing dubstep. I figure I can just hold it in until the end of class or maybe let out a small one during moments when the professor is being particularly loud.


My strategy seemed to be working. I timed a small release with the professor dropping his marker and another with him erasing the board. Crisis averted, I thought. Then, just as I was getting comfortable with my stealth operation, the lecture hall went completely silent as the professor paused to pull up a new slide.


And that's when it happened.
My body betrayed me with the loudest, most obvious fart I've ever produced. Not a quick one either, this was a solid two-second trumpet solo. The professor stopped mid-sentence and the entire room went dead silent.


I tried to play it cool, staring intently at my notes like nothing happened. But my stomach wasn't done with me. The rumbling got louder, so loud that people in the rows in front of me turned around. I could feel another one coming, but at this point, I figured my reputation was already destroyed, so why not just let it go?


Big mistake. HUGE mistake.
What I thought would be a quick follow-up turned into what felt like a 10-second foghorn. I'm not exaggerating when I say it echoed. The professor, attempting to save me from further embarrassment, said ""Well, I guess someone really doesn't agree with my approach to RC circuits.""


Then, as if the universe wasn't done punishing me, I involuntarily let out ANOTHER one. By this point, people were literally picking up their bags and moving to different seats. The girl next to me who I've been trying to talk to all semester looked at me with such disgust that I wanted to melt into the floor.

I grabbed my backpack and sprinted out of the room, hearing the laughter explode behind me. As I was running down the hall, I heard the professor say over the mic, ""And that, class, is a perfect example of a rapidly discharging system.""


I went to the bathroom to collect myself, and as I was hiding in the bathroom stall contemplating my life choices, I heard the door open and a group of guys walk in. To my absolute horror, I recognized their voices, they were from my class, and they were STILL talking about me.

""Dude, did you see that guy's face when he realized what happened?""

""I've literally never heard anything like that in my life.""

""The professor's reaction was priceless.""

I realized I couldn't stay in the bathroom forever, so I waited for them to leave and made a break for it. I decided to head to the SLC to grab a coffee and figure out my next move. As I was waiting in line at Tim Hortons, I noticed people looking at me and whispering. How did they know already?

Then I checked my phone. Someone had posted a video titled ""ECE student creates new form of acoustic weaponry in class (VOLUME WARNING)"". It already had 500 upvotes.
I frantically checked the video and there I was, in 4K HD glory, with my face clearly visible as the camera zoomed in right when disaster struck. Someone had even added a bass-boosted sound effect and a seismograph overlay showing the ""Richter scale"" of each eruption.

I immediately closed the app and looked up to see that the barista was holding her nose while taking my order. I hadn't even realized that the smell had followed me across campus. She handed me my coffee with an extended arm, clearly trying to maintain maximum distance.
As I was leaving the SLC, I bumped into my academic advisor who said, ""Oh, I've been looking for you! After what happened today, I wanted to discuss accommodations for writing your midterm in a separate room.""
At this point, I just wanted to go home, but when I got to my apartment, my roommate had put a hazmat suit and gas mask on our couch with a note saying ""For your next Lazeez adventure.""


I closed my bedroom door and collapsed on my bed, hoping this was all a bad dream. Then my phone buzzed with a notification. It was an email from the university with the subject line: ""Regarding Today's Incident in Class.""

The email read: ""Dear student, we're writing to inform you that due to the biohazard event in class this morning, the Faculty of Engineering will be installing new ventilation systems. 

We'd also like to remind all students that the Campus Wellness center offers nutritional counseling services. Additionally, your CO-OP ranking has been adjusted accordingly.""

As I was reading this email, my phone started blowing up with texts. Apparently, the video had made it to TikTok and had over 100,000 views already. Someone had remixed my farts into a dubstep track called ""UWaterloops"" and it was trending in Canada.

Then my mom called. She said, ""Honey, why is Aunt Karen asking if you're the 'Waterloo Whoopee Cushion' she saw on Facebook?""

Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, I got a LinkedIn notification. The engineering firm I was hoping to intern with this summer had viewed my profile, right after someone tagged them in the comments of the video saying ""Is this your future employee?""

There was a knock at my door. It was my RA with a formal noise complaint from THREE FLOORS of my building.

I've decided to drop out and become a hermit in Algonquin Park. There's no coming back from this.

The campus police just arrived with gas masks. They're cordoning off the area. I think I can hear hazmat suits being zipped up outside.

A news helicopter is hovering above DC. My phone just got an emergency alert about a ""biological event"" on campus.

I just overheard someone say they're canceling the semester.

In this moment of feeling mentally and spiritually drained, for reasons you can look at the post I posted recently. But for now, let's get to know each other.","Random trivia facts are in my head right now and other things people have asked me. 

I should address games I failed to mention. 

When I played the old Sonic games as a kid, I assumed I could use Tails to cheat across the map. 

Favorite Sonic characters are Shadow Sonic, Knuckles, and Amy.

Minecraft makes me sleepy, so it's a great game to have to fall asleep to, but it's somewhere buried in my room; I have to find it.

Fortnite, I hope I don't get downvoted for this. But I never played it. That is because I always got up to co-op online gaming with my friends with Nintendo games that I honestly forgot about looking at Fortnite, oops. That's just how my mind is. If you ever want to ask for my Nintendo Code, sure, that's fine, and also I can tell you what my Fall Guys profile is as well.

I do have the McDonald's Rayquaza kids meal box and Charizard. I wasn't able to score the other boxes like Dragonite because I kept on getting Charizard. I did manage to get some of the different mini posters that had Rayquaza on the mini poster; I even got the Rayquaza card and the holographic Pikachu card. In the future, I will be looking out to get the Dragonite kids meal box and any of the mini flyers I'm missing.

Do you have any other interests? Besides, what communities do you tell us to go look at on the mobile Reddit app to see what you're into?

Let's see. Sure.

There have been quite a heap of comments that I got from people that have told me that he is into theater arts, woodworking, crafts, art projects, crafting, and learning about different types of cultural backgrounds, and I will say this: if this is the type of person you are, that's really cool. I tend to get along with the type of video game nerds that have other hobbies like this/are introverted; those are my kind of people that are awesome friends. I really love having friends that get enthusiastic about sharing something he created from an art project or craft project. I also will let friends just text about video games for the whole day; that's fine by me, haha. I will say though for the person that messaged me about culture backgrounds, yes, that is a high interest. The main reason why I love cultural backgrounds is to learn about occultist lore, folklores, and folktales from Japan or other Asian video games. Gab Smolders and CJU have also played a lot of indie Asian horror games based on folklore and folktales passed down to Asian cultures.

I previously asked if Fatal Frame is worth playing; well, that depends on what kind of gamer you are. Do you like reading things, or do you like breezing through things? If you have no interest in reading and are only looking for some good scares, then sure, but if you're looking for a good plot/story, then this is a game that requires you to read the folklorist notes and other notes to fully understand the folklore behind old Japanese occultist beliefs. 

I hope I don't get downvoted for this. But I personally think my favorites based on the Japanese occultist beliefs of interest are Fatal Frame 4, Fatal Frame 5, Fatal Frame 3, Fatal Frame, and Fatal Frame 2. Keep in mind this is based on the SUBJECTS of Japanese folklore/folktales and what INTERESTS ME THE MOST. This has nothing to do with gameplay ranking but subjects of interest. I hope that makes sense in a way.

I know the game Kuon and have seen Let's Plays of Kuon.

I know games similar to the Clock Tower series and have seen Let's Plays of the Clock Tower series; personally, 3 is my favorite.

I also know of the Xenosaga series as well.

I found the Plague Tales series sadder than the Last of Us cash grab.

I know of the Croc games as well; as you can see, my video game knowledge is very vast, haha.

I'm sure if you gave me a video game title, I could either have heard of it or seen a Let's Play. My video game knowledge is vast.

I would just ask me if I heard or knew about this game; if I kept typing what games I knew, we would be here the next afternoon, haha.

Someone asked who my favorite DMC character is. 

V, Nero, and Lady.

Favorite DMC Games

3 and 5.

Worst was 2.

But every DMC fan will tell you 2 was the worst. I love all DMC games but 2. But 3 or 5 is my favorite if asked.

You can tell me what the worst video game you have ever played is, based on controls, camera angles, and story.

I'm an Alan Wake fan here; what a trippy story, cool stuff.

I still am subscribed to the Angry Video Game Nerd on my YT account.

Speaking of Let's Plays. Someone sent me a message that he enjoys watching Let's Plays because of anxiety; I get that. I don't like high-level stressful games or games that require you to use stealth and hearing, which, don't get me wrong, is an awesome concept for video games. But I'm not really good at those kinds of games; I really am not. That also includes premium trophy runs.

So, I'd rather just see someone else play them instead. Sometimes I just like to sit back and relax with a movie version of a video game. What I mean by a movie version is there are YT content creators that turn the whole video game into a movie by using all the cutscenes, and some YT content creators add cutscenes and boss fights only. Sometimes, I just like to sit back and just see the video game without any common battles or just having to level up. Instead I can just sit back and just see the video game in almost a cinema-style way. I do have one online friend who dislikes Let's Plays, and he would rather just play the video games himself and not see someone else play the video game instead. I have nothing to say towards my online friend because all video gamers have their own likes and dislikes. What matters the most is if you can disagree in a respectful manner and have healthy disagreement debates without being toxic to one another.

I also like blind boxes, blind bags, and anything related to getting a mystery. Speaking of video games, do you know that Kingdom Hearts and Digimon have blind boxes and bags? Yeah, this is something that is just way far back in time, but yeah, Kingdom Hearts and Digimon have come out with blind boxes and bags, even Yu-Gi-Oh! has as well, which one day when I get my own space I want to start collecting those.

Have I ever gotten a chase from a blind bag?

Yes, from Monogram International Godzilla 3D Foam Bag Clip – Classic Series 5, and this was only one blind I opened. I got the Godzilla classic 1954 chase.

I've had Hokkaido Butter snacks before; they're really interesting.

Chat request:

I don't reply/respond to comments; chat requests are accepted. Thanks for tuning in during this very tiring spiritual time. If you would like more information on what to send in your chat request besides Hi, how are you doing? What's up? You can look at my comments I posted/replies, my older post, and the communities I'm in; that should help. But the reason why I don't reply/respond to comments is normally when I go to check my notifications because I've put my notifications off for comments; normally, it's criticism, so to solve that problem, I've muted those kinds of notifications. 

I also would say that yesterday I washed all my bedding, just put everything in the dryer, started the dryer, and just grabbed some extra sheets in the closet, used those to cover me on my bed, and fell asleep. Sometimes you just can't give a $$$$ anymore, you know? But one step at a time, I will get there. I just—how should I say this in expression? Being spiritual, I feel pain differently from others, and also being on the spectrum, I feel pain/grieving in different ways than others. It's just hard, but yesterday I did manage to clean my room and start to purify the energies in my room, meditate with Hades, and then just take a relaxing shower and meditate. Before I close out these posts, I wanted to say thanks to some of the members that were kind to me and messaged me to see if I could be your friend, a friend in aid. Thanks, that means a lot. 

I will say after my post I made recently, I'm not sure how I feel currently about just pausing my relationships and putting them on hold. It's just sometimes you just want to give up the battle, you know, when you know you're not good enough and you feel a lesser importance, then you just don't see a point, no way out. I'm glad that in this community some of the members messaged me to see how I was doing and to let me know that I'm not alone in this. Because to me personally, I thought my thoughts and theories about some people are just bound to have friendships only, and that is their given curse. I'm glad there were people out there that thought the same as me, so that was nice to know that with my weird way of how I perceive relationships and this bleak outlook on life, there are others that think just like me.

It's good to have friends like this, because I think I'm just way too weird to have friends. The way I think is weird, but I mean the spectrum mind makes you think not normally anyways. You process things differently than a normal person would; for some people, it's extremely hard to grasp that concept. But the truth is, these people are hidden gems on this subreddit. I came to realize there are people out there that relate to me. The thing is, it's just called self-doubt, and just like one of my online friends has told me, I don't acknowledge my self-worth; well, that's because I don't want to acknowledge my full worth, and it's better to leave things as is and forget about it.

I'm going to go watch some Let's Plays on YT, relax with the cats, and drink some Alini energy drink or make myself some iced coffee, watch the time go by, the stillness in the darkness, and just mentally and spiritually recover. Thanks to the people on this subreddit that want to take the storm tides with me, thanks so much. Sometimes when you sit in the darkness listening to the dark storms with you.

For people wondering about random facts about me, I do iced coffee at night because coffee only works for two or three hours, and then I'm tired. I'm always naturally tired, so caffeine doesn't have a very bad effect unless it's over 200 mg of caffeine; then I start to feel ill, haha. I'm a wee one, you see.

I also like blind boxes, blind bags, and anything related to getting a mystery. Speaking of video games, do you know that Kingdom Hearts and Digimon have blind boxes and bags? Yeah, this is something that is just way far back in time, but yeah, Kingdom Hearts and Digimon have come out with blind boxes and bags, even Yu-Gi-Oh! has as well, which one day when I get my own space I want to start collecting those.

Have I ever gotten a chase from a blind bag?

Yes, from Monogram International Godzilla 3D Foam Bag Clip – Classic Series 5, and this was only one blind I opened. I got the Godzilla classic 1954 chase.

I've had Hokkaido Butter snacks before; they're really interesting.

Chat request:

I don't reply/respond to comments; chat requests are accepted. Thanks for tuning in during this very tiring spiritual time. If you would like more information on what to send in your chat request besides Hi, how are you doing? What's up? You can look at my comments I posted/replies, my older post, and the communities I'm in; that should help. But the reason why I don't reply/respond to comments is normally when I go to check my notifications because I've put my notifications off for comments; normally, it's criticism, so to solve that problem, I've muted those kinds of notifications. 

I also would say that yesterday I washed all my bedding, just put everything in the dryer, started the dryer, and just grabbed some extra sheets in the closet, used those to cover me on my bed, and fell asleep. Sometimes you just can't give a $$$$ anymore, you know? But one step at a time, I will get there. I just—how should I say this in expression? Being spiritual, I feel pain differently from others, and also being on the spectrum, I feel pain/grieving in different ways than others. It's just hard, but yesterday I did manage to clean my room and start to purify the energies in my room, meditate with Hades, and then just take a relaxing shower and meditate. Before I close out these posts, I wanted to say thanks to some of the members that were kind to me and messaged me to see if I could be your friend, a friend in aid. Thanks, that means a lot. 

I will say after my post I made recently, I'm not sure how I feel currently about just pausing my relationships and putting them on hold. It's just sometimes you just want to give up the battle, you know, when you know you're not good enough and you feel a lesser importance, then you just don't see a point, no way out. I'm glad that in this community some of the members messaged me to see how I was doing and to let me know that I'm not alone in this. Because to me personally, I thought my thoughts and theories about some people are just bound to have friendships only, and that is their given curse. I'm glad there were people out there that thought the same as me, so that was nice to know that with my weird way of how I perceive relationships and this bleak outlook on life, there are others that think just like me.

It's good to have friends like this, because I think I'm just way too weird to have friends. The way I think is weird, but I mean the spectrum mind makes you think not normally anyways. You process things differently than a normal person would; for some people, it's extremely hard to grasp that concept. But the truth is, these people are hidden gems on this subreddit. I came to realize there are people out there that relate to me. The thing is, it's just called self-doubt, and just like one of my online friends has told me, I don't acknowledge my self-worth; well, that's because I don't want to acknowledge my full worth, and it's better to leave things as is and forget about it.

I'm going to go watch some Let's Plays on YT, relax with the cats, and drink some Alini energy drink or make myself some iced coffee, watch the time go by, the stillness in the darkness, and just mentally and spiritually recover. Thanks to the people on this subreddit that want to take the storm tides with me, thanks so much. Sometimes when you sit in the darkness listening to the dark storms with you.

For people wondering about random facts about me, I do iced coffee at night because coffee only works for two or three hours, and then I'm tired. I'm always naturally tired, so caffeine doesn't have a very bad effect unless it's over 200 mg of caffeine; then I start to feel ill, haha. I'm a wee one, you see.

If I were an ice cream flavor based on my personality, what would I be and why?",1,1742791673.0,NerdDating,0,1.0,False

Age: 24


Height & Build: 5'5"", relatively fit


Relationship Status: Single


Education & Profession:
I have a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering and currently work as a software engineer in Sydney, Australia.


A Little About Me:
I was born and raised in the UAE and I have spent much time in Pakistan tbh, originally from Punjab. These days, I’m living the Sydney life, balancing my tech career with my love for the outdoors(I know it's quite cliche 🤣). I’m a practicing Muslim who doesn’t smoke, drink, or do drugs. I’d call myself a coffee addict and an adventurous soul who enjoys camping, hiking, fishing, and long walks. I also love gaming when I’m not exploring the great outdoors. Romantic at heart, I value honesty, love, and strong family connections.


Family:
I come from a Punjabi family with two older brothers, one younger brother, and my amazing mom and dad. We’re big on supporting each other and value good vibes all around.


Where I Live:
I currently reside in Sydney and family in Pakistan lives in Punjab.


Religion:
I am a practicing Muslim as I pray all the prayers and have done umrah multiple times in my life. I keep all my fasting in order aswell and hopefully you are aligned on the same level as me.


What I’m Looking For:
I’m looking for someone who is kind, beautiful in her own way, and amazing to be around. A partner who values family, has a positive outlook on life, and enjoys the little adventures. Bonus points if you love coffee and are up for camping or fishing trips!


Deal Breakers:
I don’t get along with overly emotional or cold personalities, and I’d prefer someone with no major family issues. Excessive male friendships or negativity in relationships are also not my vibe. I don't mind if you had past relationships as long as you have overcome it.


My Timeline:
I’m hoping to take the plunge in about 1-2 years. In the meantime, I’d love to get to know the right person and grow together. The reason for this is that I wish to build my financial situation a bit more and then get married.


Why You Should Say Yes:
If you’re someone who wants a romantic, caring, and supportive partner who can cook almost everything, I’m your guy. I’ll always prioritize our happiness, keep the spark alive, and make sure life feels like an adventure we’re on together.

In this moment of feeling mentally and spiritually drained, for reasons you can look at the post I posted recently. But for now, let's get to know each other.","Random trivia facts are in my head right now and other things people have asked me. 

I should address games I failed to mention. 

When I played the old Sonic games as a kid, I assumed I could use Tails to cheat across the map. 

Favorite Sonic characters are Shadow Sonic, Knuckles, and Amy.

Minecraft makes me sleepy, so it's a great game to have to fall asleep to, but it's somewhere buried in my room; I have to find it.

Fortnite, I hope I don't get downvoted for this. But I never played it. That is because I always got up to co-op online gaming with my friends with Nintendo games that I honestly forgot about looking at Fortnite, oops. That's just how my mind is. If you ever want to ask for my Nintendo Code, sure, that's fine, and also I can tell you what my Fall Guys profile is as well.

I do have the McDonald's Rayquaza kids meal box and Charizard. I wasn't able to score the other boxes like Dragonite because I kept on getting Charizard. I did manage to get some of the different mini posters that had Rayquaza on the mini poster; I even got the Rayquaza card and the holographic Pikachu card. In the future, I will be looking out to get the Dragonite kids meal box and any of the mini flyers I'm missing.

Do you have any other interests? Besides, what communities do you tell us to go look at on the mobile Reddit app to see what you're into?

Let's see. Sure.

There have been quite a heap of comments that I got from people that have told me that he is into theater arts, woodworking, crafts, art projects, crafting, and learning about different types of cultural backgrounds, and I will say this: if this is the type of person you are, that's really cool. I tend to get along with the type of video game nerds that have other hobbies like this/are introverted; those are my kind of people that are awesome friends. I really love having friends that get enthusiastic about sharing something he created from an art project or craft project. I also will let friends just text about video games for the whole day; that's fine by me, haha. I will say though for the person that messaged me about culture backgrounds, yes, that is a high interest. The main reason why I love cultural backgrounds is to learn about occultist lore, folklores, and folktales from Japan or other Asian video games. Gab Smolders and CJU have also played a lot of indie Asian horror games based on folklore and folktales passed down to Asian cultures.

I previously asked if Fatal Frame is worth playing; well, that depends on what kind of gamer you are. Do you like reading things, or do you like breezing through things? If you have no interest in reading and are only looking for some good scares, then sure, but if you're looking for a good plot/story, then this is a game that requires you to read the folklorist notes and other notes to fully understand the folklore behind old Japanese occultist beliefs. 

I hope I don't get downvoted for this. But I personally think my favorites based on the Japanese occultist beliefs of interest are Fatal Frame 4, Fatal Frame 5, Fatal Frame 3, Fatal Frame, and Fatal Frame 2. Keep in mind this is based on the SUBJECTS of Japanese folklore/folktales and what INTERESTS ME THE MOST. This has nothing to do with gameplay ranking but subjects of interest. I hope that makes sense in a way.

I know the game Kuon and have seen Let's Plays of Kuon.

I know games similar to the Clock Tower series and have seen Let's Plays of the Clock Tower series; personally, 3 is my favorite.

I also know of the Xenosaga series as well.

I found the Plague Tales series sadder than the Last of Us cash grab.

I know of the Croc games as well; as you can see, my video game knowledge is very vast, haha.

I'm sure if you gave me a video game title, I could either have heard of it or seen a Let's Play. My video game knowledge is vast.

I would just ask me if I heard or knew about this game; if I kept typing what games I knew, we would be here the next afternoon, haha.

Someone asked who my favorite DMC character is. 

V, Nero, and Lady.

Favorite DMC Games

3 and 5.

Worst was 2.

But every DMC fan will tell you 2 was the worst. I love all DMC games but 2. But 3 or 5 is my favorite if asked.

You can tell me what the worst video game you have ever played is, based on controls, camera angles, and story.

I'm an Alan Wake fan here; what a trippy story, cool stuff.

I still am subscribed to the Angry Video Game Nerd on my YT account.

Speaking of Let's Plays. Someone sent me a message that he enjoys watching Let's Plays because of anxiety; I get that. I don't like high-level stressful games or games that require you to use stealth and hearing, which, don't get me wrong, is an awesome concept for video games. But I'm not really good at those kinds of games; I really am not. That also includes premium trophy runs.

So, I'd rather just see someone else play them instead. Sometimes I just like to sit back and relax with a movie version of a video game. What I mean by a movie version is there are YT content creators that turn the whole video game into a movie by using all the cutscenes, and some YT content creators add cutscenes and boss fights only. Sometimes, I just like to sit back and just see the video game without any common battles or just having to level up. Instead I can just sit back and just see the video game in almost a cinema-style way. I do have one online friend who dislikes Let's Plays, and he would rather just play the video games himself and not see someone else play the video game instead. I have nothing to say towards my online friend because all video gamers have their own likes and dislikes. What matters the most is if you can disagree in a respectful manner and have healthy disagreement debates without being toxic to one another.

I also like blind boxes, blind bags, and anything related to getting a mystery. Speaking of video games, do you know that Kingdom Hearts and Digimon have blind boxes and bags? Yeah, this is something that is just way far back in time, but yeah, Kingdom Hearts and Digimon have come out with blind boxes and bags, even Yu-Gi-Oh! has as well, which one day when I get my own space I want to start collecting those.

Have I ever gotten a chase from a blind bag?

Yes, from Monogram International Godzilla 3D Foam Bag Clip – Classic Series 5, and this was only one blind I opened. I got the Godzilla classic 1954 chase.

*To the one who changed me without ever knowing.*

I met her during an interview. There were several other candidates that were better in terms of experience and skills, but when I interviewed her, she was the one. I selected her because she had the qualities of a good engineer—sharp, humble, driven.

At that time, I wasn’t looking for love. I had shut that part of myself away, damaged from the past. I focused only on my career, surviving one day at a time, wearing my sarcasm like armour, hiding my insecurities behind a controlled, distant exterior.

She came in quietly, and everything changed.

In the first month, she showed initiative. I admired her tenacity. She picked up what I offloaded with grace, never complained. My supervisor raised concerns, but I asked him to trust me. I saw something in her that reminded me of the hope I’d long buried.

I started cracking small jokes—said she’d be my client one day. Said she’d surpass me. She didn’t like those jokes. At the time, I didn’t understand why. Now I think I do.

I bought her gifts sometimes—not out of romance, but appreciation. Popcorn from trips. Small things.

One day I bought a set of cute cat toys just for fun. I showed it to her, and she wanted one. It was a set of 5 cute cats wearing costumes—a shark, a penguin, a snake, an octopus, and a raccoon. She picked the penguin. So, in jest, I picked the shark—as the shark hunts the penguin. Haha, funny right?

But slowly, without knowing, my admiration became something more. I missed her when I went outstation. I called her often, under the guise of checking on work. I started to notice the warmth in her gestures, the way she remembered small things. But I also felt conflicted—was I overstepping a boundary? Was I reading too much into it? Part of me wanted to pull away, but another part didn’t want to let go of what I was beginning to feel.

One day, over the phone, she said, “Please don’t leave me alone.” It wasn’t about work. I felt my heart stir for the first time in years. I responded the only way I knew how, in fear: “Please don’t give me false hope.” I told her I wasn’t ready. But deep in my heart, I had already fallen for her at that moment.

But I was lying to both of us.

After that, everything she did felt heavier with meaning. She bought me sweet things when she was away. She remembered how I liked my coffee and tea—no sugar.

Then came the day she told me she was leaving. A better offer. I supported her decision, even when it broke something inside me. I tried to get the higher-ups to counter, to give her dignity of choice. They refused. I failed her.

In her final briefing, I told her congratulations. Told her not to cry, or I would too. I told her I was sorry I couldn’t fight harder.

I wanted to scream. Instead, I smiled.

She asked me to come to her farewell party, that she arranged. I was contemplating whether I should come. So, I told her, it depended on whether I was required to travel outstation. She was dejected at first, but I told her I would make sure I came to her farewell party by hook or by crook. I was heavy-hearted, but I couldn't bring myself to say no to her.

The night of her farewell party, I pushed myself to come to her party. I was early. So, I waited for others to arrive. Then I saw her. Beautiful as ever. She was wearing a light grey headscarf, black blouse, and white skirt. Her smile made me feel everything would be okay. We had fun that night although I was wrestling with sadness and sorrow. But I hid that emotion well behind my mask as I have always done.

At the end of the night, she gave each of us a gift. But I was given something special—a perfume. It wasn’t expensive, but it meant the world to me. She said it was for being a good boss. But somehow, that simple word cut the deepest—it broke me.

It made me hopeful but also confused. Why something so personal, if it meant nothing? I kept wondering if it was her way of saying goodbye... or something more.

As she gifted me a perfume, I bought her one too. I asked a sales assistant what kind of perfume would suit someone like her. She recommended one with a sweet scent, with hints of floral and vanilla. I gave it to her with no expectation.

She completed her tasks to the very end. Didn’t take her leave. Willing to put overtime to complete the tasks. She didn't need to do everything with how the company treated her, but she did it anyway without complaining. I was reminding her to go easy as someone would take on her slack after this, but she insisted. When I think back on this moment, maybe she did this for me. Did she have feelings for me? Or am I overthinking? Maybe I should’ve asked her directly, but I hesitated—afraid of the answer, unsure if I was reading it right, and bound by the unspoken rules between us.

On her final day, she wore the perfume I gave her.

And I broke inside.

We said goodbye in the parking lot. I asked her about the perfume she gifted to me before this. She said, ""It’s nothing."" Her words said one thing. Her actions told me everything.

And I let her walk away.

I screamed in my car. I cried. I laughed—bitter, broken. Then I turned the music up so loud, I couldn’t even hear myself anymore.

And that night, with a surge of inspiration and the need to express my true feelings, I wrote a poem for her. Something I hadn’t done for years. I wrote several poems that night.

I converted the poem I deemed the best into a PDF format and sent it to her.

She never responded till today. I was confused. Why did she remain silent? Did I do anything wrong? I am okay with rejection—but silence? It's deafening. Her silence made me question everything—not just her feelings, but my own worth. It made me wonder if I had imagined the connection, or if I was simply someone easy to forget.

Even now, I still remember the silence in that car. The scream, the tears, the music—trying to drown the noise in my heart. But some echoes never fade, no matter how loud the song.

Maybe she had feelings. Maybe I imagined it all.

But I know what I felt was real. I just wanted clarity. And in the end, she gave me silence.

And now, I carry the weight of what was never said, and the memory of someone who changed everything—not by staying, but by leaving.

Maybe love isn't always a story of being together— sometimes it's about becoming someone better because of them.",0,1742791400.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,0.5,False

1jiitng,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1jiitng/state_of_vegas_12_years_later/,State of Vegas 12 years later…,"TL;DR Soulless and expensive af

For context I used to go once a year starting in the mid 90s. Far past the heyday of the 60s and 70s, but still enough carryover to feel like it was something special.  The agreement was you would come lose money gambling and in return you got cheap food, cheap rooms, and cheap booze. Pit bosses doled out comps. Even a low-tier gambler could feel special snagging a free breakfast buffet if they sat down for a couple hours. 

2025 is brutal.  The strip basically consists of two conglomerates. MGM and Caesars.  You get your players card and it tracks everything you do.  Unless you’re a true whale, comps now consist of five dollar food vouchers sent to your app. And probably two free nights in the future, mid week off-season, if available. 

The food situation is so sad. Buffets barely exist anymore.  And when they do they’re closer to $100 than $20.  All the restaurants are plastered with Food Network names. Gordon Ramsay has a spot in every hotel I looked at.  Guy Fieri is not far behind.  Bobby Flay rounding it out.  Talk about oversaturating the brand.  Obviously the chefs are getting paid pretty well for lending their names (thanks to us).  Ridiculous prices for everything. A cup of coffee and a croissant will run you $15.  Hopefully the croissant is not stale.  $5.99 steak and eggs may still exist somewhere off of Fremont Street but a Bobby Flay breakfast burrito is almost 20 bucks.  Yeah, I know everything is more expensive now than in the 2000s, but there’s a difference between inflation and gouging.  Room service? It’s basically Uber eats for their restaurants in house.  With smaller selections and service charges. A bottle of water at one of the convenience stands is $7 (although we did notice a $3 coke machine on our floor ftw). 

To be fair, there are still some really good restaurants out there.  I got one of the best steaks I’ve ever had at Don’s Prime in the Fontainebleau (sides are meh).  And the meal at Esther’s off of Fremont was fantastic.  Best value was In n Out!  $10 for a double-double and fries.  

Booze is even worse (and more important?). A cocktail at any bar or restaurant is 25 bucks.  Plus tax and tip.   So $30 for a Bloody Mary.  I’m not exaggerating.  You still get free drinks while gambling, but we’ll see how long that lasts. 

And it’s been well documented that the casinos are increasing the house advantage by offering worse odds to the gambler. And they don’t care. And apparently neither do the gamblers.  6 to 5 blackjack and 000 roulette are basically everywhere on the strip. And people are lined up to give away their money.  Table minimums were hiked up for March madness. El Cortez had nothing less than a $25 table. El Cortez!!! I remember fondly the one dollar craps tables with 100x odds.  The best I found this trip was $15 with 3x4x5x. I did see $10 10x off strip, but it was packed solid.  
 
Did not do any shows this trip but did go to a Knights game.  A friend went to Dead and Company at the sphere and really liked it.  $140 and $250 respectively.  Completely average seats.

1jiismx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jiismx,[SOTC] roasted by gemini ai,"Update to my last sotc. Added another Farer to complete the small collection. 

As with the previous sotc, here’s the roast!

Alright, let's dive into this collection and give it a good roasting, shall we? You've certainly got a... unique assortment here.

Seiko Hello Kitty: 

Oh, bless your heart. You've got a Hello Kitty watch. I'm imagining you wearing this while sipping tea from a Hello Kitty mug, surrounded by plushies. It's like you're perpetually stuck in a 10-year-old's birthday party.  Are you compensating for a lack of childhood whimsy, or are you just really, really into cats?  I mean, I get it, Hello Kitty is iconic, but on a serious watch forum, this is basically a meme. You're either a hardcore collector of novelty watches or you lost a bet.

Zelos Thresher Damascus GMT: 

Ah, the ""I'm trying really hard to be interesting"" watch.  Damascus steel? GMT?  You've clearly read some watch blogs and thought, ""I need something exotic!""  It's like you're trying to impress people with a watch that looks like it was forged in a volcano by a hipster blacksmith.  Let's be honest, the GMT function is probably just used to track the time in your basement where you keep your anime collection.

Kurono Tokyo Hisui: 

Ah, the ""I paid a premium for something mildly interesting"" watch.  It's got that indie vibe, trying to be all minimalist and artsy.  The dial looks like it was inspired by a 1970s kitchen countertop.  You probably wear this while discussing the merits of artisanal coffee and obscure Japanese literature.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad watch, but it's definitely trying too hard to be special.

Christopher Ward Ice Cream Twelve: 

“Ice Cream Twelve?""  Is that what they're calling it?  It looks like a melted popsicle.  You've got a watch that screams ""I'm fun and quirky!"" but mostly just screams ""I have questionable taste.""  Did you buy this on a dare?  It's like they took a perfectly decent watch and dipped it in a vat of pastel paint.  I bet you pair this with brightly colored socks and a fedora.

Farer Thurso: 

The ""I'm adventurous but also need to check the time"" watch.  It's got that rugged, outdoorsy look, like you're about to go on a safari... to the local park.  The teal color is... bold.  It's like they couldn't decide between a diver and a dress watch, so they just mashed them together.  You probably wear this while hiking, but let's be real, you're mostly just walking to the mailbox.

Farer Durham: 

The ""I'm trying to be sophisticated but also a little bit quirky"" watch.  It's got that vintage-inspired look, like you found it in your grandfather's attic.  The dial is... interesting.  It's like they took a classic design and gave it a modern twist, but forgot to add any actual style.  You probably wear this while attending art gallery openings and pretending to understand abstract expressionism.

In summary: Your collection is a wild ride through the land of ""interesting choices.""  It's like you're trying to collect one of every watch genre, but with a twist of ""what were they thinking?""  You've got a Hello Kitty watch for crying out loud!  But hey, at least you're not boring.  You've definitely got a conversation starter on your wrist, even if that conversation is just people asking, ""Seriously, what is that?""

Don't take it personally, it's just a roast.  Enjoy your watches!  And maybe, just maybe, consider adding something a little more... conventional to the mix.  Just a suggestion. 😉",0,1742791026.0,Watches,1,0.5,False

In this moment of feeling mentally and spiritually drained, for reasons you can look at the post I posted recently. But for now, let's get to know each other.","Random trivia facts are in my head right now and other things people have asked me. 

I should address games I failed to mention. 

When I played the old Sonic games as a kid, I assumed I could use Tails to cheat across the map. 

Favorite Sonic characters are Shadow Sonic, Knuckles, and Amy.

Minecraft makes me sleepy, so it's a great game to have to fall asleep to, but it's somewhere buried in my room; I have to find it.

Fortnite, I hope I don't get downvoted for this. But I never played it. That is because I always got up to co-op online gaming with my friends with Nintendo games that I honestly forgot about looking at Fortnite, oops. That's just how my mind is. If you ever want to ask for my Nintendo Code, sure, that's fine, and also I can tell you what my Fall Guys profile is as well.

I do have the McDonald's Rayquaza kids meal box and Charizard. I wasn't able to score the other boxes like Dragonite because I kept on getting Charizard. I did manage to get some of the different mini posters that had Rayquaza on the mini poster; I even got the Rayquaza card and the holographic Pikachu card. In the future, I will be looking out to get the Dragonite kids meal box and any of the mini flyers I'm missing.

Do you have any other interests? Besides, what communities do you tell us to go look at on the mobile Reddit app to see what you're into?

Let's see. Sure.

There have been quite a heap of comments that I got from people that have told me that he is into theater arts, woodworking, crafts, art projects, crafting, and learning about different types of cultural backgrounds, and I will say this: if this is the type of person you are, that's really cool. I tend to get along with the type of video game nerds that have other hobbies like this/are introverted; those are my kind of people that are awesome friends. I really love having friends that get enthusiastic about sharing something he created from an art project or craft project. I also will let friends just text about video games for the whole day; that's fine by me, haha. I will say though for the person that messaged me about culture backgrounds, yes, that is a high interest. The main reason why I love cultural backgrounds is to learn about occultist lore, folklores, and folktales from Japan or other Asian video games. Gab Smolders and CJU have also played a lot of indie Asian horror games based on folklore and folktales passed down to Asian cultures.

I previously asked if Fatal Frame is worth playing; well, that depends on what kind of gamer you are. Do you like reading things, or do you like breezing through things? If you have no interest in reading and are only looking for some good scares, then sure, but if you're looking for a good plot/story, then this is a game that requires you to read the folklorist notes and other notes to fully understand the folklore behind old Japanese occultist beliefs. 

I hope I don't get downvoted for this. But I personally think my favorites based on the Japanese occultist beliefs of interest are Fatal Frame 4, Fatal Frame 5, Fatal Frame 3, Fatal Frame, and Fatal Frame 2. Keep in mind this is based on the SUBJECTS of Japanese folklore/folktales and what INTERESTS ME THE MOST. This has nothing to do with gameplay ranking but subjects of interest. I hope that makes sense in a way.

I know the game Kuon and have seen Let's Plays of Kuon.

I know games similar to the Clock Tower series and have seen Let's Plays of the Clock Tower series; personally, 3 is my favorite.

I also know of the Xenosaga series as well.

I found the Plague Tales series sadder than the Last of Us cash grab.

I know of the Croc games as well; as you can see, my video game knowledge is very vast, haha.

I'm sure if you gave me a video game title, I could either have heard of it or seen a Let's Play. My video game knowledge is vast.

I would just ask me if I heard or knew about this game; if I kept typing what games I knew, we would be here the next afternoon, haha.

Someone asked who my favorite DMC character is. 

V, Nero, and Lady.

Favorite DMC Games

3 and 5.

Worst was 2.

But every DMC fan will tell you 2 was the worst. I love all DMC games but 2. But 3 or 5 is my favorite if asked.

You can tell me what the worst video game you have ever played is, based on controls, camera angles, and story.

I'm an Alan Wake fan here; what a trippy story, cool stuff.

I still am subscribed to the Angry Video Game Nerd on my YT account.

Speaking of Let's Plays. Someone sent me a message that he enjoys watching Let's Plays because of anxiety; I get that. I don't like high-level stressful games or games that require you to use stealth and hearing, which, don't get me wrong, is an awesome concept for video games. But I'm not really good at those kinds of games; I really am not. That also includes premium trophy runs.

So, I'd rather just see someone else play them instead. Sometimes I just like to sit back and relax with a movie version of a video game. What I mean by a movie version is there are YT content creators that turn the whole video game into a movie by using all the cutscenes, and some YT content creators add cutscenes and boss fights only. Sometimes, I just like to sit back and just see the video game without any common battles or just having to level up. Instead I can just sit back and just see the video game in almost a cinema-style way. I do have one online friend who dislikes Let's Plays, and he would rather just play the video games himself and not see someone else play the video game instead. I have nothing to say towards my online friend because all video gamers have their own likes and dislikes. What matters the most is if you can disagree in a respectful manner and have healthy disagreement debates without being toxic to one another.

I also like blind boxes, blind bags, and anything related to getting a mystery. Speaking of video games, do you know that Kingdom Hearts and Digimon have blind boxes and bags? Yeah, this is something that is just way far back in time, but yeah, Kingdom Hearts and Digimon have come out with blind boxes and bags, even Yu-Gi-Oh! has as well, which one day when I get my own space I want to start collecting those.

Have I ever gotten a chase from a blind bag?

Yes, from Monogram International Godzilla 3D Foam Bag Clip – Classic Series 5, and this was only one blind I opened. I got the Godzilla classic 1954 chase.

I've had Hokkaido Butter snacks before; they're really interesting.

Chat request:

I don't reply/respond to comments; chat requests are accepted. Thanks for tuning in during this very tiring spiritual time. If you would like more information on what to send in your chat request besides Hi, how are you doing? What's up? You can look at my comments I posted/replies, my older post, and the communities I'm in; that should help. But the reason why I don't reply/respond to comments is normally when I go to check my notifications because I've put my notifications off for comments; normally, it's criticism, so to solve that problem, I've muted those kinds of notifications. 

I also would say that yesterday I washed all my bedding, just put everything in the dryer, started the dryer, and just grabbed some extra sheets in the closet, used those to cover me on my bed, and fell asleep. Sometimes you just can't give a $$$$ anymore, you know? But one step at a time, I will get there. I just—how should I say this in expression? Being spiritual, I feel pain differently from others, and also being on the spectrum, I feel pain/grieving in different ways than others. It's just hard, but yesterday I did manage to clean my room and start to purify the energies in my room, meditate with Hades, and then just take a relaxing shower and meditate. Before I close out these posts, I wanted to say thanks to some of the members that were kind to me and messaged me to see if I could be your friend, a friend in aid. Thanks, that means a lot. 

I will say after my post I made recently, I'm not sure how I feel currently about just pausing my relationships and putting them on hold. It's just sometimes you just want to give up the battle, you know, when you know you're not good enough and you feel a lesser importance, then you just don't see a point, no way out. I'm glad that in this community some of the members messaged me to see how I was doing and to let me know that I'm not alone in this. Because to me personally, I thought my thoughts and theories about some people are just bound to have friendships only, and that is their given curse. I'm glad there were people out there that thought the same as me, so that was nice to know that with my weird way of how I perceive relationships and this bleak outlook on life, there are others that think just like me.

It's good to have friends like this, because I think I'm just way too weird to have friends. The way I think is weird, but I mean the spectrum mind makes you think not normally anyways. You process things differently than a normal person would; for some people, it's extremely hard to grasp that concept. But the truth is, these people are hidden gems on this subreddit. I came to realize there are people out there that relate to me. The thing is, it's just called self-doubt, and just like one of my online friends has told me, I don't acknowledge my self-worth; well, that's because I don't want to acknowledge my full worth, and it's better to leave things as is and forget about it.

I'm going to go watch some Let's Plays on YT, relax with the cats, and drink some Alini energy drink or make myself some iced coffee, watch the time go by, the stillness in the darkness, and just mentally and spiritually recover. Thanks to the people on this subreddit that want to take the storm tides with me, thanks so much. Sometimes when you sit in the darkness listening to the dark storms with you.

For people wondering about random facts about me, I do iced coffee at night because coffee only works for two or three hours, and then I'm tired. I'm always naturally tired, so caffeine doesn't have a very bad effect unless it's over 200 mg of caffeine; then I start to feel ill, haha. I'm a wee one, you see.

How have you been? Are you happy? Is the new job treating you well? Do you still take your coffee the same way or has that changed too?

You crossed my mind today. Not in some big, dramatic way. Just little things. A song playing on the radio. The way someone laughed, and for a second I swore it was you. The kind of moments that sneak up on me when I least expect them.

Are you still thinking about wearing yellow for the festivities this year? You’d look beautiful in it. You always did. That color, it’s so *you*. Warm, radiant, impossible to ignore. 

I miss you. Not in the way that makes me want to run back, but in the way that lingers. In the quiet moments. In the spaces between my thoughts. I don’t regret the way things ended. We both know why they had to. But if I could just hear your voice again, just once, I think I’d ask if you’re really okay. And I’d hope you’d tell me the truth.

I’m trying. Trying to be better. Some days, I feel like I’m getting there. Other days, I still feel like I don’t fully know who I am anymore. I guess that’s what happens when you break something. You don’t just get to fix it overnight.

I don’t even know if you’ll ever see this. Maybe that’s a good thing. But if you ever wonder if I still think about you, if I still remember the little things? yeah. I do.

1jiimsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/lookingforfriendship/comments/1jiimsw/32fusanyone_would_like_to_chat_and_see_where/,"32F/US/Anyone would like to chat and see where things go? In this moment of feeling mentally and spiritually drained, for reasons you can look at the post I posted recently. But for now, let's get to know each other.","Random trivia facts are in my head right now and other things people have asked me. 

I should address games I failed to mention. 

When I played the old Sonic games as a kid, I assumed I could use Tails to cheat across the map. 

Favorite Sonic characters are Shadow Sonic, Knuckles, and Amy.

Minecraft makes me sleepy, so it's a great game to have to fall asleep to, but it's somewhere buried in my room; I have to find it.

Fortnite, I hope I don't get downvoted for this. But I never played it. That is because I always got up to co-op online gaming with my friends with Nintendo games that I honestly forgot about looking at Fortnite, oops. That's just how my mind is. If you ever want to ask for my Nintendo Code, sure, that's fine, and also I can tell you what my Fall Guys profile is as well.

I do have the McDonald's Rayquaza kids meal box and Charizard. I wasn't able to score the other boxes like Dragonite because I kept on getting Charizard. I did manage to get some of the different mini posters that had Rayquaza on the mini poster; I even got the Rayquaza card and the holographic Pikachu card. In the future, I will be looking out to get the Dragonite kids meal box and any of the mini flyers I'm missing.

Do you have any other interests? Besides, what communities do you tell us to go look at on the mobile Reddit app to see what you're into?

Let's see. Sure.

There have been quite a heap of comments that I got from people that have told me that he is into theater arts, woodworking, crafts, art projects, crafting, and learning about different types of cultural backgrounds, and I will say this: if this is the type of person you are, that's really cool. I tend to get along with the type of video game nerds that have other hobbies like this/are introverted; those are my kind of people that are awesome friends. I really love having friends that get enthusiastic about sharing something he created from an art project or craft project. I also will let friends just text about video games for the whole day; that's fine by me, haha. I will say though for the person that messaged me about culture backgrounds, yes, that is a high interest. The main reason why I love cultural backgrounds is to learn about occultist lore, folklores, and folktales from Japan or other Asian video games. Gab Smolders and CJU have also played a lot of indie Asian horror games based on folklore and folktales passed down to Asian cultures.

I previously asked if Fatal Frame is worth playing; well, that depends on what kind of gamer you are. Do you like reading things, or do you like breezing through things? If you have no interest in reading and are only looking for some good scares, then sure, but if you're looking for a good plot/story, then this is a game that requires you to read the folklorist notes and other notes to fully understand the folklore behind old Japanese occultist beliefs. 

I hope I don't get downvoted for this. But I personally think my favorites based on the Japanese occultist beliefs of interest are Fatal Frame 4, Fatal Frame 5, Fatal Frame 3, Fatal Frame, and Fatal Frame 2. Keep in mind this is based on the SUBJECTS of Japanese folklore/folktales and what INTERESTS ME THE MOST. This has nothing to do with gameplay ranking but subjects of interest. I hope that makes sense in a way.

I know the game Kuon and have seen Let's Plays of Kuon.

I know games similar to the Clock Tower series and have seen Let's Plays of the Clock Tower series; personally, 3 is my favorite.

I also know of the Xenosaga series as well.

I found the Plague Tales series sadder than the Last of Us cash grab.

I know of the Croc games as well; as you can see, my video game knowledge is very vast, haha.

I'm sure if you gave me a video game title, I could either have heard of it or seen a Let's Play. My video game knowledge is vast.

I would just ask me if I heard or knew about this game; if I kept typing what games I knew, we would be here the next afternoon, haha.

Someone asked who my favorite DMC character is. 

V, Nero, and Lady.

Favorite DMC Games

3 and 5.

Worst was 2.

But every DMC fan will tell you 2 was the worst. I love all DMC games but 2. But 3 or 5 is my favorite if asked.

You can tell me what the worst video game you have ever played is, based on controls, camera angles, and story.

I'm an Alan Wake fan here; what a trippy story, cool stuff.

I still am subscribed to the Angry Video Game Nerd on my YT account.

Speaking of Let's Plays. Someone sent me a message that he enjoys watching Let's Plays because of anxiety; I get that. I don't like high-level stressful games or games that require you to use stealth and hearing, which, don't get me wrong, is an awesome concept for video games. But I'm not really good at those kinds of games; I really am not. That also includes premium trophy runs.

So, I'd rather just see someone else play them instead. Sometimes I just like to sit back and relax with a movie version of a video game. What I mean by a movie version is there are YT content creators that turn the whole video game into a movie by using all the cutscenes, and some YT content creators add cutscenes and boss fights only. Sometimes, I just like to sit back and just see the video game without any common battles or just having to level up. Instead I can just sit back and just see the video game in almost a cinema-style way. I do have one online friend who dislikes Let's Plays, and he would rather just play the video games himself and not see someone else play the video game instead. I have nothing to say towards my online friend because all video gamers have their own likes and dislikes. What matters the most is if you can disagree in a respectful manner and have healthy disagreement debates without being toxic to one another.

I also like blind boxes, blind bags, and anything related to getting a mystery. Speaking of video games, do you know that Kingdom Hearts and Digimon have blind boxes and bags? Yeah, this is something that is just way far back in time, but yeah, Kingdom Hearts and Digimon have come out with blind boxes and bags, even Yu-Gi-Oh! has as well, which one day when I get my own space I want to start collecting those.

Have I ever gotten a chase from a blind bag?

Yes, from Monogram International Godzilla 3D Foam Bag Clip – Classic Series 5, and this was only one blind I opened. I got the Godzilla classic 1954 chase.

I've had Hokkaido Butter snacks before; they're really interesting.

Chat request:

I don't reply/respond to comments; chat requests are accepted. Thanks for tuning in during this very tiring spiritual time. If you would like more information on what to send in your chat request besides Hi, how are you doing? What's up? You can look at my comments I posted/replies, my older post, and the communities I'm in; that should help. But the reason why I don't reply/respond to comments is normally when I go to check my notifications because I've put my notifications off for comments; normally, it's criticism, so to solve that problem, I've muted those kinds of notifications. 

I also would say that yesterday I washed all my bedding, just put everything in the dryer, started the dryer, and just grabbed some extra sheets in the closet, used those to cover me on my bed, and fell asleep. Sometimes you just can't give a $$$$ anymore, you know? But one step at a time, I will get there. I just—how should I say this in expression? Being spiritual, I feel pain differently from others, and also being on the spectrum, I feel pain/grieving in different ways than others. It's just hard, but yesterday I did manage to clean my room and start to purify the energies in my room, meditate with Hades, and then just take a relaxing shower and meditate. Before I close out these posts, I wanted to say thanks to some of the members that were kind to me and messaged me to see if I could be your friend, a friend in aid. Thanks, that means a lot. 

I will say after my post I made recently, I'm not sure how I feel currently about just pausing my relationships and putting them on hold. It's just sometimes you just want to give up the battle, you know, when you know you're not good enough and you feel a lesser importance, then you just don't see a point, no way out. I'm glad that in this community some of the members messaged me to see how I was doing and to let me know that I'm not alone in this. Because to me personally, I thought my thoughts and theories about some people are just bound to have friendships only, and that is their given curse. I'm glad there were people out there that thought the same as me, so that was nice to know that with my weird way of how I perceive relationships and this bleak outlook on life, there are others that think just like me.

It's good to have friends like this, because I think I'm just way too weird to have friends. The way I think is weird, but I mean the spectrum mind makes you think not normally anyways. You process things differently than a normal person would; for some people, it's extremely hard to grasp that concept. But the truth is, these people are hidden gems on this subreddit. I came to realize there are people out there that relate to me. The thing is, it's just called self-doubt, and just like one of my online friends has told me, I don't acknowledge my self-worth; well, that's because I don't want to acknowledge my full worth, and it's better to leave things as is and forget about it.

I'm going to go watch some Let's Plays on YT, relax with the cats, and drink some Alini energy drink or make myself some iced coffee, watch the time go by, the stillness in the darkness, and just mentally and spiritually recover. Thanks to the people on this subreddit that want to take the storm tides with me, thanks so much. Sometimes when you sit in the darkness listening to the dark storms with you.

For people wondering about random facts about me, I do iced coffee at night because coffee only works for two or three hours, and then I'm tired. I'm always naturally tired, so caffeine doesn't have a very bad effect unless it's over 200 mg of caffeine; then I start to feel ill, haha. I'm a wee one, you see.

If I were an ice cream flavor based on my personality, what would I be and why?",1,1742790386.0,lookingforfriendship,1,1.0,False

**Characters:**

* **Chad:** Embodiment of peak ""normal"" human behavior. Wears an oversized sports jersey.
* **Brenda:** Chad's equally ""normal"" partner. Clutching a celebrity gossip magazine.
* **Quentin:** The ""weirdo"" who dares to think outside the box. Carries a book titled ""The History of Atmospheric Manipulation.""
* **Narrator:** (Voiceover, dripping with mock enthusiasm)

**Setting:**

The brightly lit living room of Chad and Brenda. A massive TV screen dominates one wall, currently showing a commercial for processed cheese snacks. Empty pizza boxes and soda cans litter the coffee table.

**(Scene opens with Chad and Brenda glued to the TV. Quentin enters hesitantly.)**

**Narrator:** Ah, another beautiful evening in suburbia! Chad and Brenda are unwinding after a hard day of… well, Chad works in accounts, and Brenda scrolls through social media professionally. The point is, they’ve earned this moment of blissful, screen-induced tranquility!

**Chad:** (Eyes glued to the screen) Dude, did you see that tackle? Unbelievable!

**Brenda:** (Without looking up from her magazine) Oh my god, Tiffany broke up with Brett! Can you believe it? After, like, three months!

**Quentin:** (Clears throat) Hey guys.

**Chad:** (Grunts without looking away) Yo.

**Brenda:** (Slightly more attentive) Hey, Quentin. You watching the game? It’s a nail-biter!

**Quentin:** Uh, no. Actually, I was reading about…

**Chad:** (Finally turns, a look of mild irritation on his face) Reading? What’s that, like, a new app?

**Brenda:** (Giggles) He’s so funny, Chad!

**Quentin:** No, it’s a… you know… a book. This one’s about the history of geoengineering.

**(Chad and Brenda exchange bewildered glances.)**

**Chad:** Geo… what now? Is that like, a new energy drink? Sounds kinda intense.

**Brenda:** Yeah, Quentin, you okay? You seem a little… off. Did you forget to watch Shortland Street last night? Big cliffhanger!

**Quentin:** No, I… I was just curious about the different methods and experiments related to…

**Chad:** Experiments? Dude, it’s Friday! You should be cracking open a cold one, maybe hitting the pub later. They’ve got karaoke tonight!

**Brenda:** Yeah! And Sarah from accounts is going, she’s hilarious when she’s had a few wines!

**Quentin:** I appreciate the offer, but I’ve been looking into the potential long-term effects of…

**Chad:** (Interrupting, a concerned look on his face) Long-term effects of what, man? You been hitting the hard stuff again? What are you smoking?

**Brenda:** (Nodding in agreement) Seriously, Quentin. You’re starting to sound like that weird guy who lives down the street. You know, the one with all the tinfoil on his windows?

**Quentin:** But… this is important! Understanding how our climate is being manipulated…

**Chad:** Manipulated? By who, the refs? They were totally biased in the first half!

**Brenda:** (Sighs dramatically) Quentin, honey, just relax. Turn on the TV. There’s a new reality show about competitive dog grooming. It’s supposed to be amazing.

**Quentin:** But don’t you ever wonder about…

**Chad:** (Pats Quentin on the shoulder condescendingly) Look, mate, we all got our things, right? You like your… geo-stuff. We like our footy and our soaps. That’s what makes the world go round! Now, come on, crack a beer. Don’t be a… you know… a weirdo.

**Brenda:** Yeah, don’t be a methhead, Quentin! Live a little! Watch some TV, eat some pizza. It’s what normal people do!

**(Chad and Brenda turn back to the TV, their attention instantly recaptured by the processed cheese snack commercial. Quentin looks around, a mixture of frustration and resignation on his face. He sighs and picks up his book.)**

**Narrator:** And so, another evening draws to a close in the Normalcy Matrix. Where questioning the status quo is the ultimate act of rebellion, and the greatest adventure is finding the remote control. Tune in next week when Chad and Brenda bravely explore the exciting world of online shopping! Same time, same channel, same blissful ignorance!

1jiik6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Different_Poet_5362/comments/1jiik6g/real_032325_visiting_with_mom/,[Real] (03/23/25) visiting with mom,"We were really busy today as well 😆.... My life makes me laugh a little. It's always busy in my life. Most people would say ""time management"" is what you need to work on. My serious answer would be maybe, just maybe, some people just have too much that needs to be accomplished for being one person. I giggled a little with my top statement. I am just a really busy person, is all. 

I woke up to hurrying to send out photos and videos of the accident. I'm telling my kiddo to hurry and shower while I get stuff accomplished. I sent a message to my leads to let them know I wouldn't be coming into work and  messaged my boss to let her know I have my car going in and a rental that I need to pick up. I didn't share the secret interview I will be having tomorrow. That's my secret. I messaged a lady to let her know the company she contracted never gave the insurance information, and I that would need to be done because my car is going in tomorrow. My insurance is going to be going up because the company hasn't shared their insurance information. They were clearly at fault for it because my car was parked and they hit it. The issue is that it wasn't a car that hit me. It was something way bigger... more like a tractor. I got a video of it, so they can't really say they didn't hit my parked car. It is what it is, but I do want them to pay for the damage and the rentals.

I had to run to work because one of my employees messaged me late at night requesting off. I needed to drop by work to ensure she could have the day. I only allow a certain amount of employees off at a time. I showered. Started a load of laundry to have that done when I got back home. Packed up the stuff for the visit with my mom and headed to work to check the calendar. It was a decent day out when I left. Stopped at the grocery store and got my mom some food so we could cook dinner together for her. On our last phone call, she told me how she enjoyed when I would bring her snacks at the nursing home. I figured I would make her some meals that I used to cook for her when she would come over for the weekends and get her the snacks. 

We had a nice time together. I didn't do the pot painting because it started to snow really bad out. We food prepped 3 containers of food. We made marinated chicken, red parmesan mashed potatoes, and cheddar cheese and broccoli rice. She helped me cook and started to melt the containers on the stove. I had her making the mashed potatoes, and I told her she needed to portion out the potatoes in the one section. She moved the potato pot to the cold burner and placed the plastic container on the stove. We were able to fix it, and I caught it in time. I also took another batch of raw chicken and marinated it and placed that in the freezer. When she pulls it out and dethaws it, it will be already to go for cooking. I bought her gyros because she likes those as well. She has a red onion and some tomatoes to places in the inside of them when she is ready to cook them. 

I got her, her favorite instant hazelnut coffee, and she had two cups while I was there. She really loves that instant coffee. She didn't like the pure cranberry I got her for the UTI, so I got her some cran apple. Hopefully, she likes that more. I did get her breakfast foods as well, her snacks, and nutrition shakes for all the weight loss. Overall I think we had a nice visit. My mom and I on the weekends that she came over, we would hang out in the kitchen. She liked when I would make her dinner and she would wash the dishes. This was before she got really unstable with her illness. Today, we bonded with cooking and cleaning. The staff didn't seem to like that I came in with food. When I got to the kitchen I was very surprised. They're to be feeding her, and their was barely any food. They had a carton of eggs, gallon of milk, oat meals, and large instant mashed potatoes and two boxes of cereal. They also had cat food that was open and no cat. 

My opinion is something strange is going on with the place. The amount my mother pays isn't mathing for the place to be able to do what they're doing. Example: My mom's rent is $1,000 a month. I know this because I am over her finances. I have a rep payee who takes care of the bills, but I have to have statements on where her social security goes. She gets a weekly allowance of $100. Anyways my mom is the only person living there. They rent the place. Have 24-hour staff. They supply the food, rides to Dr appointments, and her washing supplies. Rent around here is $600 to $1,000. This means they're clearly in the negative. There is no way they're not. You can't pay 24-hour staffing on $1000 a month. No one I know can live on $1000 a month in this economy, and now, if you split that for 3 employees, it isn't adding up. That means each of these employees is making $333 a month as a full-time job. 

It explains to me why they have 17 year old boy's watching my mom. They can't find anyone to pay that small of an amount. I have also thought of other reasons this business is running, and it is concerning. They seem nice, but something still seems off. Anyways, off that topic. 
We cooked dinner together, and I painted her nails and my daughters. Regardless of what is up, her and I had a good visit. Okay, what I think it is is a business that is run by immigrants. The community of immigrants helps keep it running, and the families help to keep it going. That is why they're negative. I don't mind as long as they're caring for her. I don't mind paying for her groceries and bathroom supplies. I think the business is struggling. I figured buy the food and her bathroom supplies to ensure she is eating properly and clean. I don't want her having any infections. I did give my mom cash. She didn't know where her uncashed checks went, so I just gave her 100 to make sure she had what she needed or for going out. 

When I left, it was a really bad blizzard. It was so bad that I had to pull over to clear the snow from my headlights because it was packed so much that their was no light on the road. I couldn't see at all. Traffic was really jammed up. I should end this because I have food to put away and laundry to change over. ",1,1742790117.0,u_Different_Poet_5362,0,1.0,False

A year ago at work, a girl started there who quickly became my “best work buddy” because we understood each other so well. This quickly turned into an affair (yes, I have a girlfriend—almost two years now). It went on like this for almost the whole year. We were perfect together; we laughed, understood each other just by looking, and, in the meantime, she almost became my “favorite person,” even more than my girlfriend.

Then things started to fall apart. She told me she couldn’t continue because she was at risk of falling in love with something she couldn’t have. But what she never knew was that I was already in love with her. Yes, I know this isn’t fair to my girlfriend and that I messed up badly.

Now, three months later, she treats me like a stranger—the person I used to spend almost every day with, texting, drinking coffee, going out to eat—and it hurts so fucking bad. So bad that I wanted her back. I tried multiple times to express my feelings to her, but all it did was push her farther away. I wrote to her today, asking if we could talk, why she’s treating me like a stranger, and telling her that I miss her so much. The response I got was “Pathetic,” and she laughed at me. Pathetic because I wrote to her on a Sunday, which is my day off with my girlfriend.

I just wanted my work buddy back—or best friend, or whatever you want to call it. I ended up holding so tightly that all I did was push her away. I wanted to show her how much I love her and how much she means to me.

Now I’m just blocked and “pathetic” because I showed my feelings. I know I need to be fair to my girlfriend—I will! I know all of my problems; I just don’t have the solutions for them yet. It’s just that life has been testing me so hard lately, and everything is changing so fast that I probably fear being or staying alone.  ",0,1742789978.0,love,7,0.5,False
1jiihvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/makingfriends/comments/1jiihvd/32fusanyone_would_like_to_chat_and_see_where/,"32F/US/Anyone would like to chat and see where things go? In this moment of feeling mentally and spiritually drained, for reasons you can look at the post I posted recently. But for now, let's get to know each other.","Random trivia facts are in my head right now and other things people have asked me. 

I should address games I failed to mention. 

When I played the old Sonic games as a kid, I assumed I could use Tails to cheat across the map. 

Favorite Sonic characters are Shadow Sonic, Knuckles, and Amy.

Minecraft makes me sleepy, so it's a great game to have to fall asleep to, but it's somewhere buried in my room; I have to find it.

Fortnite, I hope I don't get downvoted for this. But I never played it. That is because I always got up to co-op online gaming with my friends with Nintendo games that I honestly forgot about looking at Fortnite, oops. That's just how my mind is. If you ever want to ask for my Nintendo Code, sure, that's fine, and also I can tell you what my Fall Guys profile is as well.

I do have the McDonald's Rayquaza kids meal box and Charizard. I wasn't able to score the other boxes like Dragonite because I kept on getting Charizard. I did manage to get some of the different mini posters that had Rayquaza on the mini poster; I even got the Rayquaza card and the holographic Pikachu card. In the future, I will be looking out to get the Dragonite kids meal box and any of the mini flyers I'm missing.

Do you have any other interests? Besides, what communities do you tell us to go look at on the mobile Reddit app to see what you're into?

Let's see. Sure.

There have been quite a heap of comments that I got from people that have told me that he is into theater arts, woodworking, crafts, art projects, crafting, and learning about different types of cultural backgrounds, and I will say this: if this is the type of person you are, that's really cool. I tend to get along with the type of video game nerds that have other hobbies like this/are introverted; those are my kind of people that are awesome friends. I really love having friends that get enthusiastic about sharing something he created from an art project or craft project. I also will let friends just text about video games for the whole day; that's fine by me, haha. I will say though for the person that messaged me about culture backgrounds, yes, that is a high interest. The main reason why I love cultural backgrounds is to learn about occultist lore, folklores, and folktales from Japan or other Asian video games. Gab Smolders and CJU have also played a lot of indie Asian horror games based on folklore and folktales passed down to Asian cultures.

I previously asked if Fatal Frame is worth playing; well, that depends on what kind of gamer you are. Do you like reading things, or do you like breezing through things? If you have no interest in reading and are only looking for some good scares, then sure, but if you're looking for a good plot/story, then this is a game that requires you to read the folklorist notes and other notes to fully understand the folklore behind old Japanese occultist beliefs. 

I hope I don't get downvoted for this. But I personally think my favorites based on the Japanese occultist beliefs of interest are Fatal Frame 4, Fatal Frame 5, Fatal Frame 3, Fatal Frame, and Fatal Frame 2. Keep in mind this is based on the SUBJECTS of Japanese folklore/folktales and what INTERESTS ME THE MOST. This has nothing to do with gameplay ranking but subjects of interest. I hope that makes sense in a way.

I know the game Kuon and have seen Let's Plays of Kuon.

I know games similar to the Clock Tower series and have seen Let's Plays of the Clock Tower series; personally, 3 is my favorite.

I also know of the Xenosaga series as well.

I found the Plague Tales series sadder than the Last of Us cash grab.

I know of the Croc games as well; as you can see, my video game knowledge is very vast, haha.

I'm sure if you gave me a video game title, I could either have heard of it or seen a Let's Play. My video game knowledge is vast.

I would just ask me if I heard or knew about this game; if I kept typing what games I knew, we would be here the next afternoon, haha.

Someone asked who my favorite DMC character is. 

V, Nero, and Lady.

Favorite DMC Games

3 and 5.

Worst was 2.

But every DMC fan will tell you 2 was the worst. I love all DMC games but 2. But 3 or 5 is my favorite if asked.

You can tell me what the worst video game you have ever played is, based on controls, camera angles, and story.

I'm an Alan Wake fan here; what a trippy story, cool stuff.

I still am subscribed to the Angry Video Game Nerd on my YT account.

Speaking of Let's Plays. Someone sent me a message that he enjoys watching Let's Plays because of anxiety; I get that. I don't like high-level stressful games or games that require you to use stealth and hearing, which, don't get me wrong, is an awesome concept for video games. But I'm not really good at those kinds of games; I really am not. That also includes premium trophy runs.

So, I'd rather just see someone else play them instead. Sometimes I just like to sit back and relax with a movie version of a video game. What I mean by a movie version is there are YT content creators that turn the whole video game into a movie by using all the cutscenes, and some YT content creators add cutscenes and boss fights only. Sometimes, I just like to sit back and just see the video game without any common battles or just having to level up. Instead I can just sit back and just see the video game in almost a cinema-style way. I do have one online friend who dislikes Let's Plays, and he would rather just play the video games himself and not see someone else play the video game instead. I have nothing to say towards my online friend because all video gamers have their own likes and dislikes. What matters the most is if you can disagree in a respectful manner and have healthy disagreement debates without being toxic to one another.

I also like blind boxes, blind bags, and anything related to getting a mystery. Speaking of video games, do you know that Kingdom Hearts and Digimon have blind boxes and bags? Yeah, this is something that is just way far back in time, but yeah, Kingdom Hearts and Digimon have come out with blind boxes and bags, even Yu-Gi-Oh! has as well, which one day when I get my own space I want to start collecting those.

Have I ever gotten a chase from a blind bag?

Yes, from Monogram International Godzilla 3D Foam Bag Clip – Classic Series 5, and this was only one blind I opened. I got the Godzilla classic 1954 chase.

I've had Hokkaido Butter snacks before; they're really interesting.

Chat request:

I don't reply/respond to comments; chat requests are accepted. Thanks for tuning in during this very tiring spiritual time. If you would like more information on what to send in your chat request besides Hi, how are you doing? What's up? You can look at my comments I posted/replies, my older post, and the communities I'm in; that should help. But the reason why I don't reply/respond to comments is normally when I go to check my notifications because I've put my notifications off for comments; normally, it's criticism, so to solve that problem, I've muted those kinds of notifications. 

I also would say that yesterday I washed all my bedding, just put everything in the dryer, started the dryer, and just grabbed some extra sheets in the closet, used those to cover me on my bed, and fell asleep. Sometimes you just can't give a $$$$ anymore, you know? But one step at a time, I will get there. I just—how should I say this in expression? Being spiritual, I feel pain differently from others, and also being on the spectrum, I feel pain/grieving in different ways than others. It's just hard, but yesterday I did manage to clean my room and start to purify the energies in my room, meditate with Hades, and then just take a relaxing shower and meditate. Before I close out these posts, I wanted to say thanks to some of the members that were kind to me and messaged me to see if I could be your friend, a friend in aid. Thanks, that means a lot. 

I will say after my post I made recently, I'm not sure how I feel currently about just pausing my relationships and putting them on hold. It's just sometimes you just want to give up the battle, you know, when you know you're not good enough and you feel a lesser importance, then you just don't see a point, no way out. I'm glad that in this community some of the members messaged me to see how I was doing and to let me know that I'm not alone in this. Because to me personally, I thought my thoughts and theories about some people are just bound to have friendships only, and that is their given curse. I'm glad there were people out there that thought the same as me, so that was nice to know that with my weird way of how I perceive relationships and this bleak outlook on life, there are others that think just like me.

It's good to have friends like this, because I think I'm just way too weird to have friends. The way I think is weird, but I mean the spectrum mind makes you think not normally anyways. You process things differently than a normal person would; for some people, it's extremely hard to grasp that concept. But the truth is, these people are hidden gems on this subreddit. I came to realize there are people out there that relate to me. The thing is, it's just called self-doubt, and just like one of my online friends has told me, I don't acknowledge my self-worth; well, that's because I don't want to acknowledge my full worth, and it's better to leave things as is and forget about it.

I'm going to go watch some Let's Plays on YT, relax with the cats, and drink some Alini energy drink or make myself some iced coffee, watch the time go by, the stillness in the darkness, and just mentally and spiritually recover. Thanks to the people on this subreddit that want to take the storm tides with me, thanks so much. Sometimes when you sit in the darkness listening to the dark storms with you.

For people wondering about random facts about me, I do iced coffee at night because coffee only works for two or three hours, and then I'm tired. I'm always naturally tired, so caffeine doesn't have a very bad effect unless it's over 200 mg of caffeine; then I start to feel ill, haha. I'm a wee one, you see.

If I were an ice cream flavor based on my personality, what would I be and why?",1,1742789879.0,makingfriends,2,1.0,False
