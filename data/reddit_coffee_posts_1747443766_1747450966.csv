1koiwv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ioniq6/comments/1koiwv7/powering_refrigerator_during_power_outage/,Powering refrigerator during power outage!,"We lost power last night. About an hour later I remembered that we could use the Ioniq 6 for electricity. Took me a bit to figure out (no WiFi of course) but then plugged a 50 ft extension cord into the outlet under the rear seats, plugged in the fridge, and voila!  At that point it was 62% charged. 

I stayed up for a bit to see how much power it was using. Not much!  Went to sleep and in the morning briefly swapped the coffee maker  in, made coffee, plugged the fridge back in & went to work in another car. After almost 24 hrs battery was down to 42% or so. 

So I figured I would try charging at a nearby Electrify America for the first time. Unplugged the extension cord and realized I’d left the air conditioning on in the car. I guess that’s why it had used so much battery life.  

Anyway, after 12 minutes at Electrify America I was back to 80%!  Drove home, plugged the extension cord back in, and made sure the air & lights were off.  

This is amazing. To not have to worry about spoiled food in a summer power outage!!!  I already loved my Ioniq 6. Best car ever!",3,1747450581.0,Ioniq6,0,1.0,False

1koivfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1koivfh/vyvanse_help/,Vyvanse help,"I’ve been on Vyvanse for 3 years now. And I’d say I know how to help myself when the meds aren’t working but lately it feels like things have changed.. :/ 
I’m looking for advice, around the situations I’ve been in.

So today I felt good leading up to my group interview, practiced lots.
But when I was walking through the mall to get to the interview, my ADD is hitting hard which in turn makes my anxiety go up bc I know I won’t be on top of my game.  
Throughout the interview, I feel anxious, and this inhibition to add to convos bc I can’t string my thoughts and words well.. even talking about my work experience was tough even tho I know it very well. My vocabulary feels like it’s been reduced to a quarter and I’m pausing lots. Even tho I’m a great speaker lol.

When I first started taking my meds it actually solved this problem. I felt super focused and felt present, thoughts springing out of my mouth like it’s second nature and not such a hassle.. 
I could handle my anxiety and respond calmly, and make the right decisions. 

I’ve tried taking days off meds. I’ve completely cut off drugs and alcohol for about a month now. Exercising my brain by reading books, games, challenges. Eating well. Drinking coffee..(which used to help me.. but doesn’t anymore). upping my protein intake. Exercising at least twice a week. 

It’s every time I’m in public settings my brain decides to shut down, too many people having convos.. shut down. 
Going to the library.. shut down. Going out for dinner.. shut down. 

My only theory right now is that it’s my anxiety that’s triggering this brain fog. And if I could manage it better, less brain fog.. but idk if it’s the meds that’s making me feel more anxious… I used to be the biggest social guy up until September of 2024.. 
now I tend to stay home more with the girlfriend. So it also has me thinking.. is it because of this change in environment/lifestyle that has me more socially awkward.. even tho I’m fighting for my life to string my thoughts together and to be more social.. I choose to avoid bc I know my ADD will be bad.. not because I don’t wanna hang. 

I also want to add that I take 30mg of the generic brand Vyvanse. Recently I asked for a 10mg booster but haven’t noticed a difference tbh. 

Initially noticed better focus switching brands and hence why I still take the generic brand. Now that better focus is gone and prefer this brand bc it’s cheaper..

Anyways, thoughts/opinions?

1koiux6,https://www.reddit.com/r/2under2/comments/1koiux6/dads_ability_to_juggle_2/,Dad's ability to juggle 2?,"We have a 7.5 month old and a newly 2 year old. And dad has never been alone with the baby. He takes the toddler to the park and the store but has never taken just the baby and definitely has never had both kids alone, even at home. I have gone out 3 times without the kids and each time he's needed to call in back up (either his mom or a friend) he knows I need a break-but just doesn't seem comfortable having both babies alone. 

I'm a stay at home mom, I'm alone with both boys every day-all day. He has his weekly boys night where he is kid free, he gets his hair cut when he wants, he does things outside of work and the house. He has two weekend get aways planned for this summer with his buddies. When I bring up going away for a girls weekend he gets realllly anxious and just tells me he doesn't know if the baby will be okay without me or he doesn't know how he would do it. And don't get me wrong I am greatful to beable to spend this time with these boys but I'm also struggling with post partum depression (medicated and doing better but some days are still hard). I feel drained all the time. I have no hobbies. I don't do anything. When I see my friends its with the kids, doing kid oriented activities. I go to play dates, story times, parks, indoor jungle gyms with BOTH kids and I guess I'm getting a little frustrated that I can't leave them with their dad without him getting anxious and telling me he can't do it. 

I do want to stress that he's not uninvolved, he plays with the boys, he cooks dinner most nights, he helps with dishes, he reads to the boys, does the toddlers bath time and bedtime routine. We all eat dinner together, and breakfast together on the weekends he's not hands off by any means. 

But I think lacks confidence and I don't know how to help. Should I gradually leave the house, go for a walk, then maybe go grab a coffee, should I try just sitting out in my car to be available if he needs me? Should I just pull the bandaid off and tell him to suck it up these are his kids too and he needs to just figure it out? Do I continue to schedule help for him when I want time by myself? 

Any advise would be great. And I'd love to hear if anyone else is in this type of situation. 

A few notes for context:

Our baby had a rough start, a nicu stay, and colic. He was a very unhappy baby. He didn't like anyone else holding him except me. But now that he's older he's a pretty happy baby, he has a schedule that keeps him happy, he's more social and doesn't freak when I walk away. I thought when he got more manageable I might get a break but I think he's gotten comfortable only being in charge of the toddler. ",2,1747450393.0,2under2,0,1.0,False

1koiuns,https://www.reddit.com/r/High_quality_apron/comments/1koiuns/high_appearance_level_strong_functionality_the_5/,"High appearance level + strong functionality: The ""5 Golden Rules for Choosing Modern Aprons""","When aprons have advanced from ""kitchen labor protection items"" to ""life ritual items"", consumers' expectations for them have long gone beyond merely ""blocking oil stains"".

A truly excellent modern apron needs to precisely match the scene requirements like a smart wearable device, and at the same time possess aesthetic value comparable to that of fashionable items.

The following is a gold selection guide summarized through professional evaluation and market research, helping you find the ""all-round partner"" in the kitchen battlefield.

**Rule One: Material Battle - From Basic Protection to Technological Empowerment**

 **The limitations of the ""pure cotton sentiment""**

Traditional pure cotton aprons have long dominated household kitchens due to their skin-friendly and breathable properties. However, actual measurement data shows that after cooking braised pork once, the oil stain penetration rate of pure cotton apron reaches 68%, and it is prone to deformation and hardening after repeated washing.

[braised pork](https://preview.redd.it/spyhus0z991f1.jpg?width=730&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa2980405ec798d2311f1c33beab3c3925258ce3)

**Advanced plan:**

 **Polyester-cotton blend + nano-coating:** Composite fabric, the surface layer adopts hydrophobic nano-technology. Soy sauce drops can be wiped clean with a paper towel within 5 seconds. The stain resistance is 70% higher than that of pure cotton, while retaining 35% of cotton fibers to ensure breathability.

The Shupo cotton independently developed by Kefei Company has excellent waterproof performance. It is not only aesthetically pleasing but also fully functional, making it truly perfect.

 

[Shupo cotton](https://preview.redd.it/tf28koi1a91f1.jpg?width=789&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e91ce9fcddb574790132f0aa37fc9e11b5abba9b)



[apron made by shupo cotton](https://preview.redd.it/x2ghileaa91f1.jpg?width=4090&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=007879a0263205f399d74aa7087b67a3d4ee751d)

**Food-grade silicone revolution:** Silicone aprons that have passed FDA food contact certification, can withstand high temperatures up to 260℃ and are machine washable and foldable. They are particularly suitable for high-temperature frying scenarios. Amazon reviews show that their service life is three times that of fabric aprons.

 **A new eco-friendly force:** Blending coffee grounds extract into yarn not only has antibacterial and deodorizing effects, but each apron is equivalent to recycling 30 cups of coffee grounds, making it a favorite among sustainable consumers in Europe and America.

**Rule Two: The Devil is in the details - Ergonomic design determines the frequency of use**

**Pocket Revolution**

After being tested by 100 users, it was found that for traditional flat pockets with a depth of less than 15cm, the probability of mobile phones slipping off is as high as 43%. The 3D pocket with three-dimensional cutting (it is recommended to choose the size of 16×28cm) has an internal zoning design that can accommodate:

Left: Smart phone (compatible with a 6.8-inch large screen)

On the right: Kitchen timer + temperature probe

Top magnetic strip: Secure recipe notes

Wearable system upgrade

Traditional neck straps have caused 83% of users to report ""shoulder soreness"". The German Red Dot Award-winning work ""Magnetic Apron"" adopts:

4cm widened memory foam shoulder straps: Distribute 60% of shoulder pressure

Rare earth magnetic buckle: Quick on and off in 0.3 seconds, 30% more efficient than tying straps

Waist smart adjuster: Achieve full coverage of the waist circumference from 56 to 130cm through the slider

**Rule Three: Scenario-based precise Strikes - Different battlefields require different equipment**

**Essential for baking Experts**

Length standard: A long apron (85-95cm) can fully cover the thighs to prevent flour and frosting from staining the home clothes.

Splash-proof front: The A-shaped front panel with A waterproof TPU coating is recommended by the British Baking Association. The 30° tilt design allows liquids to slide off automatically.

Special accessories: Anti-slip wrist straps to prevent the cuffs from sticking when kneading the dough.

Outdoor barbecue war God configuration

Safety reflective strip: 3M Scotchlite reflective material, visible from 30 meters away at night, reducing the risk of charcoal fire operations;

Tool hanging system: Military-grade nylon webbing + mountain climbing buckle, which can hang equipment such as meat tongs, oil bottles, flashlights, etc.

Rapid heat dissipation structure: The breathable mesh fabric under the armpits, combined with the ventilation duct design on the back, has been measured to lower the temperature by 4-6℃.",1,1747450368.0,High_quality_apron,0,1.0,False

The Mona Lisas running from the Death Deity to try and wear him out, but the Death Deity isn't that easy to tire out, as he begins to charge up an attack, as the Blade glowed purple, he launched a fiery human skull making a high pitched screaming noise that explodes on contact with multiple clones, destroying them for a while. This attack was known as...

**SPECTRAL SHOT.**

Chernobog: Just what in helheim is that woman's ability?...It's clone creation has no end...

Heimdall: AND THE CLONES KEEP COMING FOLKS! CHERNOBOG CAN'T KEEP KILLING THEM! IS THIS GONNA BE ANOTHER WIN TO HUMANITY?!

All the gods were worried, another win to humanity in a row? This early in the tournament? What would this say they were as beings supposed to be above their creations?...however, this wasn't shared among all, as suddenly, a god laughed very loudly.

???: Him?! Lose?! Ha! Imagine that! Say isn't that funny Hel?

The God responsible for the noise wore a black cloak with a skull to help hold it together. Underneath he wore a dark blue toga with leather sandals on his feet.

???: Quiet Thanatos, but...you're right, if anyone's gonna secure the god's win, it'll absolutely be that God...

The goddess who said that had a rather peculiar face, with 1 half showing a beautiful woman with blond hair and blue eyes, while the other showed a rotting corpse. She wore a hangerok with the skirt reaching to her knees.

The 2 gods, now revealed to be fellow Death Deities Thanatos and Hel, were watching the fight with the other pantheons deities of the end to support Thanatos.

???: Hush you two! We came here to watch Boggy fight! not so you can bicker!

The goddess in question wore a purple Kimono with red spider Lillies decorated around them, her Obi was blue and she carried a white wagasa with pink Sakura decorated onto it. Meanwhile, she wore Geta, which had a black toe thong.

Hel: Sorry Izanami...

Thanatos: My bad mom-IZANAMI! I MEANT IZANAMI!

Everyone turned to look at Thanatos, even the fighters.

Thanatos:...just ignore that! PLEASE!

Lisa clone?: Are...those your friends?

Chernobog: It's not your business to know, but I prefer the term, colleagues...I work with them, but I do not exactly consider them friends.

Lisa clone?: I see...well then, die!

The Lisa clone charges forward with a knife, but Chernobog throws another Spectral Shot at the Lisa clone, launching her away and destroying her.

Chernobog: Rather unfitting, seeing as I'm a Death Deity.

The Lisa clones suddenly revealed multiple fire arms and throwing weapons aimed towards the God, as one of the Lisas smirk.

Lisa clone?: Is that so? Well then, allow me to give you a fitting death!

The immortal opened fire, as Chernobog quickly spun his scythe, as wisps of souls formed from each spin, soon covering Chernobog into a giant orb, which hardened into a barrier.

Chernobog: **Soul** **Guard**!

The barrier withstood the onslaught as the army of immortal women continued to try and break through.

Chernobog: There's no use in trying to win Immortal, Death will come for you all.

Chernobog suddenly begins moving the sphere, as the Lisas begin to run away, but to no avail as they were crushed under the giant barrier.

Chernobog(POV): Still nothing, there has to be something that differentiates her...wait, think, did she have any sort of different item that the clones don't?...

Lisa clone?: You should pay more attention, especially in a fight.

Bullets suddenly broke through the ball of energy, which snapped Chernobog out of his train of thought.

Chernobog: Damn it...

Chernobog sees a group of Lisa clones running his way.

Chernobog sighs and slams his hand to the ground, as multiple skeletal hands grasp the legs of the Mona Lisas.

Chernobog: **Wave of the Dead.**

Chernobog then released another Spectral Shot at the Lisas, resulting in the same results.

(V.I.P Stands: Valkyries)

Aslaug watched as the fight ensued.

Aslaug: Woah...for someone with such a kind face, her ability is scary!...

Göll: Wait kind face?...what do you mean?!

**(Prior to Round 2: Lisa Del Giocondo's waiting room)**

The 2 Valkyries and Cain were seated at a fine dining table. The room of the woman behind Leonardo Da Vinci's greatest masterpiece looked similar to a house found in the renaissance. It's walls and furniture were all beautifully made.

Cain: Woah...how do you make these rooms?!

Göll: Ah, that's...actually I'm pretty sure we use magic. I don't know which one though.

Lisa: Sorry to keep you waiting, I've brought you all some coffee and cake.

Lisa sets down a tray of desserts and cappuccinos. The dessert tray carried many delicious Italian treats, such as mini tiramisus, tricolored cookies, crunchy biscottis, and many other delicious sweets.

Aslaug: Woah! These look good!

Cain smiled wide at Lisa's kind offer.

Cain: Did you make these yourself!?

Lisa: I did, it's the least I could offer.

Cain: Aww, Big Bro's so proud of you! Come here!

Cain pulls Lisa into a big bear hug. Lisa seemed quite uncomfortable, but understood why Cain seemed to be like this.

Lisa: Thank you...Cain, now please, enjoy.

The 2 Valkyries and Cain each grabbed a confection, as they all took a bite, they soon were met with the delicious taste of each treat.

Aslaug: You simply must give me the recipes! These would be great for reunions with the other Aunties!

Lisa smiles.

Lisa: I'll send you the recipes before the round.

When the face of Lisa was revealed, it was shown her face...was beautiful, she had soft eyes, and looked innocent.

**(Back to now)**

Göll: Wait, no! Her face wasn't like that! It was scary!

**(Prior to Round 2: Lisa Del Giocondo's Waiting room)**

The same scene took place, but when it got to the part where the Mona Lisa's face was revealed to look malicious, with sharp eyes and a smile that looks like there's a evil scheme behind it.

**(Back to now)**

Aslaug: Wait what do you mean?! How can her face be scary?!

Göll: How can her face look kind?!

Jack: Hm...I think I got an idea of what's happening.

Göll+Aslaug: What?

Jack: You see, I was introduced to a certain theory, it involved a cat, a box, a flask of poison, something that breaks glass like a hammer, and a Geiger counter. If the Geiger counter detects radioactivity, the hammer breaks the flask, and the cat dies, but if it doesn't, the cat lives. Making the cat both alive and dead.

Aslaug: What kind of Cruel experiment is that?!

Göll: Wait, you mean Schrödinger's cat?

Aslaug: What?

Hlokk: It's a thought experiment, essentially, it's saying the cat's a paradox, which is what can best describe this woman.

Jack: It's possible since there's not much other idea for what could be causing this differing view unless you two have different opinions of what looks kind and what doesn't.

Aslaug: That...actually makes sense!

Jack: However, it's only a possibility, we can't be sure unless there's proof.

**(In the stands)**

A lone man stood as the fight continued, he had a gray beard and wore a dark gray beret, his robes orange covered by a blue jacket that reached down to his feet which had brown shoes. This was the man Leonardo Da Vinci.

Leonardo Da Vinci(Italian, Famed Artist)

Leonardo: You never change, do you Lisa...ah well, can't say I'm surprised...she was like this when we met too.

For 7 months or so I’ve had the below symptoms with no infection. 
- Pelvic pain with or without holding urine but more so when holding urine 
- Pain in the vagina/vulva/urethra
- Urgency/Frequency without emptying much 
- Needing to pee so many times a day/night 

The symptoms had only disappeared once for a couple weeks then returned. I suspect it has ‘triggers’ because when it disappeared i wasn’t drinking coffee or milk very often until it returned. Which makes me lean more toward IC. I also have kidney disease so my nephrologist referred me to a urologist recently. 
The last few days I’ve had new symptoms associated with it though: 
- Stinging/uncomfortability when peeing. 
- Lower back pain
- Constant pelvic pain
- Pain that has spreads more upwards to cover my whole lower stomach and pelvis rather then just the pelvic region 
- Pain in 1 area of my right side of pelvis, inside of hip(close to hip bone). 

I went to the GP who prescribed me antibiotics without doing a dipstick due to other medical conditions (see below) that would give a confusing result. 
I’m on my last day of antibiotics and i don’t feel any different.. When i’ve taken antibiotics in the past it has eased the symptoms at least short term but this time i don’t feel any different. 

TW‼️Contains text about miscarriage. 

I had a recent miscarriage and had to use MISO pill and then a d&c (last friday) so I still have pregnancy hormones in my system and I am also extremely constipated which I’m wondering is contributing to the extensive pain then usual. 
Can anyone relate to this? It’s been so long dealing with this issue without seeing anyone and it SUCKS. 
Does it sound like IC? Or something else?

1koinw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1koinw7/aio_girlfriend_of_3_months_wants_to_scuba_dive/,AIO: Girlfriend of 3 months wants to Scuba dive weekly one-on-one with an instructor she’s previously kissed whilst drunk,"So, I’ve (40m) been dating Jessica (30f) for 3 months now. After my divorce 1.5 years ago I was miserable for over a year, bordering on depression. Then she came into my life, everything has been a wonderful ray of sunshine since then. She’s kind, intelligent, beautiful, and we just have the most amazing days together. It’s only been 3 months, but because both of us have flexible jobs and schedules, we spend almost every day together and the relationship has really blossomed much faster than 3 months would tend to indicate.

She’s very into Scuba, but I know she hasn’t been doing it at all on the island we live on because she doesn’t really like the coaches of the schools here, and she doesn’t have her own gear/boat, so she would need to use them to dive with. She’s very excited that her old coach is returning after an absence on the island after some time away.

I don't know what prompted me to ask, but I just blurted out: ""Hey was there ever anything between you and Albert (the coach)?"" And she replied, ""We had a drunk kiss. One time, and never again."" I wasn't really sure how to react. I replied that I appreciated her telling me the truth, but I would have preferred not having to ask a direct question. This relates to her other instructor Bob, who she had told me she had a physical relationship. She told me unsolicited. Pretty soon after we started dating, she told me she had a scuba retreat on another island. No big deal. Once we dated a bit more and we felt ""exclusive"" she told me that she had had a sexual relationship with the instructor from the retreat, that was basically agreed between the two of them that since she was only on the island for the retreat, it would just be for the time she was there and nothing more. She wanted me to know before she went away for the retreat (obviously she had booked the retreat before we even met). He has a serious girlfriend now, and she's seeing me and they had both spoken and it was clear there would be nothing going on. Through mutual friends, I know this part is all true, Bob does have a new girlfriend and she would be at the retreat as well. I felt a bit uneasy, but I trusted her, and I didn't want to be controlling. Plus, she had this fling way before we even met, and she had this retreat planned before we ever went out on a date.

Anyway, she plans to freedive with Albert (the instructor coming back to the island) once a week, to get her practice in. I felt really uneasy about it the whole afternoon, especially since I felt like this time she didn't volunteer that they had kissed once, I actually asked. And I questioned why have I never asked about any other guy before, but I asked about this one? Is it possibly because of the way she talks about him? Rather than let it fester, I brought up my discomfort with her this evening. She thought for a second and acknowledged my feelings and made me feel validated in bringing it up. She also said that ""can we talk about this more in a couple of days, so I can think on it?” Because I get what you're saying, but if I don't dive with him, it means I basically don't dive on the island."" I also replied that I didn't bring it up to tell her not to go with him, I just wanted her to hear my feelings and validate them which she did. That I understand that diving one-on-one is also something safety critical and you need to be able to trust the person you are diving with.

But it’s been festering on my mind more and more since then. This is literally the third time something similar has happened in three months. The first month, was the dive retreat with the guy she had slept with. Then last month her ex-boyfriend came back to the island, and she got a coffee with him (after telling him about me, and that there was no chance anything was going to happen with them). Now she wants to dive weekly with a guy that’s kissed before. Everyone has a past and mine is probably much sketchier than hers. The issue is that her past keeps rearing its head into our present.

I do trust her and I’m not a jealous guy at all. I’ve always believed that if you have to worry and keep tabs on your partner, and the only thing that would stop them from cheating is you doing that, then that’s not a real relationship anyway. I also don’t want to control her and stop her from doing things she enjoys. But I don’t love the fact I had to flat out ask if anything had happened between them before, or it seems she wouldn’t have even told me about it.

I also feel that if the positions were reversed, I would understand better about why she wouldn’t want me to be seeing someone weekly (one-on-one) that I had kissed before. And I wouldn’t do it to her. She seems to see things differently though, in that it was a stupid kiss in the past that meant nothing, and shouldn’t affect what she does now in the present and future.

I don’t feel comfortable with this arrangement where she would be seeing this guy weekly. In fact I feel sick just thinking about it. But I also don’t want to control what she does. If the positions were reversed, I would probably volunteer not to do it. But if the positions were reversed and she gave me an ultimatum on it, I would probably end the relationship because I hate ultimatums.

Am I overreacting in this situation and the past should be the past and what she did whilst single before she met me shouldn’t matter? Or is this just a normal reaction? She’s an amazing girlfriend, and I never thought I had the right to be this happy again in my life. Is it worth possibly throwing it all away by insisting that she doesn’t dive with this guy, if she wants to continue a relationship with me?

TLDR: having an amazing relationship with an amazing woman. Genuinely see a life in the future for us. But her past whilst single, keeps showing up in our present and now she wants to scuba dive weekly (which could be one-on-one) with her scuba instructor who she has previously kissed before.",1,1747449728.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

So I would like some advice especially from women. My dating game is really bad. Like I have been in relationships but all of them went from being friends to then getting closer. I am not really good at flirting etc.

There's this girl at my work. I have been noticing her for sometime. More than a couple days back I introduced myself and then after that for 2 days have been going on small walks with her for breaks.

On both the days the conversation was friendly. It wasn't flirty. I am not sure if I should have taken it in that direction. Anyways I am not that smooth with flirting. I did compliment her nails which are super cute ngl and also her dressing sense. It's cute.

I don't really know how to proceed from here. We did follow each other on instagram. Sometimes there have been glances being passed, smiles etc etc.

I am nervous. It's after a 2 year span I have a crush on someone. Idk what to do.

What I am thinking? - I was thinking of pinging her on instagram. Seeing if she replies and maybe do some small talk. If that works maybe ask her out for a coffee or something.

I don't know what to do. A part of me says be you. If it's meant to be it'll. Although one advice I want to know. People usually say don't compliment girls on their apperance in the begining. Just wanted to know how true this is. It's just that I have never seen someone as cute as her to the extent that when she walked into the hall that day my mind could only process one thing ""You're fucked!"".

I’m worried the premise is too boring or the writing too clunky to be worth continuing. Please be brutally honest. This is an excerpt from the first chapter



As I laid back on the bed staring at the ceiling, my mind finally began to quiet.  Am I dissociating or have I reached Nirvana?  I took a drag from my cigarette.  The smoke made my throat itch and stung my nose and eyes but I persisted.  I didn’t love it but it wasn’t too unpleasant.  It gave me something to do with my hands and kept my mind off whatever I was feeling.  Mom’s gonna kill me if she sees me like this, but dad smokes a lot so maybe she'll assume it’s him that she smells.  Maybe growing up with it is why I can tolerate it.  It smells sickly but also warm, nutty, and strangely soothing. I worry about dad.  He smokes too much and works too hard.  On the rare occasion we’re home at the same time he has a cigarette in his mouth.  Mom tells him to smoke outside but he doesn’t care.  At least he quit smoking in the living room and stays in his bedroom.  Will I end up like him?  What must his lungs look like?  I should try to quit when I graduate.

Shit I’m overthinking again.



Thick smoke stings my eyes

While my loud mind longs for rest,

And my lungs for peace.

\-Ren



Some ash fell on my neck and burned me.  I flinched and saw bits of ash down the front of my blouse.  My shirt will definitely reek now.  Maybe I’ll ask to stay the night just to be safe.  I already know Sonya’s dad won’t mind.  He lets her do whatever she wants.  And even if he did mind I hardly even see him whenever I visit.  It’s a weeknight so it’ll be a hard sell for my mom.  I guess I can put it off until the sun sets and tell her I lost track of time and don’t wanna walk in the dark.  What if she offers to drive me?  Quite the conundrum.



“Rena, you’re doing it again.”



I blinked and turned my head to face Sonya lying down right next to me.  “What do you mean?”



“You shouldn’t zone out with a smoke in your hand,” she said as she passed me an ashtray.  The ceramic tray was shaped like a turtle missing its shell.  Every time I saw it I thought how strange it was for something so cute to be an accessory to our vices.  I crushed the cigarette into the tray and she closed the lid, returning his shell.  “Are you tired? Did you sleep well?”



I couldn’t tell if she was concerned for me or her bedsheets.  She spoke with basically no inflection in her voice so a lot of people had a hard time reading her and she often came across as rude or uncaring.  I don’t know how she manages to work in the service industry.



""I’m ok, just a lot on my mind.”

“I thought midterms are over for you.”

“They are.”

“Did you do bad?”

“No.”

“What’s to be worried about?”

“Nothing.  Or maybe everything I don’t know.  My thoughts are just bouncing around”

“Overactive mind is a symptom of depression.”

“Everything’s a symptom of everything.”



Sonya let out a single breathy grunt.  That’s the closest to a laugh I could ever get out of her.  I don’t think I’m depressed, but she was right.  I had no reason to be anxious.  I did fine on all my midterms, winter break is around the corner, and yet I couldn't shake this aching in the pit of my stomach.



“How did you do on your midterms?”  I knew she hated being asked about her grades, and liked small talk even less, but I had to try focusing on one thing.  She didn’t get mad or anything but I already knew what she was going to say.  “It’s over.  Why do you ask? What does it matter?  No, it’s ok.  Same as it ever was.”  I’ve seen her grades.  She’s not a bad student, I just wish she cared more.



“Same as it ever was.”

“What’s that even supposed to mean?”

“You already know.”

“It doesn’t make sense as an answer”

“It makes enough sense.”

“Then explain how it does.”

“No.”

“Rude.”



Sonya might be the most Zen person I know, without her even trying.  She lived in the moment, didn’t like making plans, and never complained.  How can anyone be content with everything?  I couldn’t help but envy her, but I knew this was a dangerous mindset.



“Have you decided on a college?”

“Nope.”

“You’re running out of time.  It’d be cool if we could go to the same college and be roommates.”



She didn’t answer.  She just reached for the pack in between us and lit another cigarette for herself.  I actually was beginning to worry.  It’s December, she graduates in a little less than six months.  She never seemed to particularly like serving coffee, but didn’t seem to have any real aspirations.  I’ve known her since 2nd grade and I still didn’t know of any of her goals in life.  Could working up the ranks in a coffee shop be it?  She’s pretty smart; she'd probably be a fine manager or even owner.



“Sony.”

“Hm.”

“Would you make me some coffee?

“You hate coffee.”

“Well can you make something even I would like?”

“Where’s this coming from?”

“I’ll visit your work and then you’ll have to make me coffee.”

“Please don’t.”

“Por que?”

“I want my personal life and my professional life to stay separate.”

“I guess that’s fair”



There was a long silence.  I wouldn’t say Sonya is a bad host but there usually isn’t much to talk about.  One of few words, always to the point.  Her love language was being physically present.  Whenever she invited me over I always came, even though we usually just sat in silence while we smoked, read, or studied.  I wish she had a tv.  ",1,1747449237.0,writingcritiques,0,1.0,False

------------

Many people want to lose weight. I see some take pre-workout pills. But do these pills really help? Some studies show that about 15% of adults in the US use supplements for weight loss. I want to know if pre-workout is useful.

This writing explains how pre-workout *might* help you lose weight. I will talk about how it works. I will also talk about what things are inside. Pre-workout is not magic. You must still eat good food and do exercise. If not, you may not lose weight. This paper tells you what to look for so it can help. I hope to make it easy for everyone to understand. This is not medical advice. Consult a doctor.

How Pre-Workout *Might* Support Weight Loss Efforts
---------------------------------------------------

Pre-workout drinks can help you work out harder. I see people use these to try to lose weight. But how does this work? Here are the ways pre-workout can help.

First, I noticed it gives you more power. When you have more power, you can lift more weight. You can do more exercise. More exercise burns more calories. Second, the pills make you want to move. When you want to move, you exercise. You do not stay on your sofa all day. Third, these pills *might* make your body burn more fat. This is because of some things inside the pill. But this change might be small. It might not help much.

Remember, the main thing for losing weight is eating less food. You must eat fewer calories than you use. I think this is the important part. I want people to learn and see clearly.

Key Ingredients Often Found in Pre-Workouts for Weight Loss
-----------------------------------------------------------

I look at pre-workout labels to see what is inside. Some things can help with exercise or losing weight. Let me tell you about them.

### Common Stimulants (e.g., Caffeine)

Caffeine is a big one. I use it when I feel sleepy to study for exams. It gives power and wakes you up. It can also make your body burn more calories. But be careful! Too much caffeine is not good. Know how much you can take. Do not take too much. Every person is different.

### Other Potentially Relevant Ingredients (e.g., L-Carnitine, Green Tea Extract)

Some pre-workouts have L-Carnitine. The idea is this helps move fat in your body to be burned. Green tea extract is also common. People think this can help your body, too. But remember! These things in pre-workout may not make a big change. More studies are needed to see how they can help. I like learning the facts.

Choosing the Right Pre-Workout for Your Weight Loss Goals
---------------------------------------------------------

To choose the right pre-workout, first, read what is inside. See what matches your goals.

### Assessing Your Sensitivity to Stimulants

How does your body feel when you drink coffee? If coffee makes you shake, maybe you should not take too much pre-workout. Find one with less caffeine. I learn by watching my body. If it feels bad, stop. Some pre-workouts do not have caffeine. These are called ""stim-free."" If caffeine bothers you, try these.

### Looking for Transparent Ingredient Lists

Some companies hide how much of each thing is inside. They use something called a ""proprietary blend."" I do not like this. You cannot know how much you are getting. Pick the pre-workout that tells you clearly what is inside. Then, you can decide if it is good for you.

How to Use Pre-Workout Effectively for Weight Loss
--------------------------------------------------

Here is how I think you should use pre-workout to help lose weight.

Take pre-workout before you exercise. Thirty minutes is a good time. Do not take too much. Read the instructions. Start with a small amount. See how it makes you feel. It is good to drink water when you take pre-workout.

Remember, pre-workout is not a replacement for eating good food. It is also not a replacement for exercise. It is only a tool to help you. I always remember this.

Also, do not take pre-workout every day. Your body can get used to it. It will not work as well. Take breaks sometimes. I always listen to my body.

Potential Side Effects and Considerations
-----------------------------------------

Pre-workout can have side effects. I tell you what they are.

### Common Side Effects (e.g., jitters, crash, digestive issues)

Sometimes, pre-workout makes you feel shaky. This is because of the caffeine. Sometimes, you might feel very tired after the pre-workout wears off. Some people have tummy problems. If you have these problems, stop taking the pre-workout.

### Who Should Consult a Doctor Before Use

If you have heart problems, talk to a doctor. If you get anxious easily, talk to a doctor. If you take medicine, talk to a doctor. If you are pregnant, do not take pre-workout. If you are feeding a baby, do not take pre-workout. I always ask my doctor before trying new things. This is important.

The Importance of Diet and Exercise (Beyond Supplements)
--------------------------------------------------------

I want you to know this clearly: Pre-workout is not the main thing for losing weight.

The main thing is eating right. You must eat fewer calories than you use. The main thing is also doing exercise. You must move your body.

Pre-workout can help you with your exercise. But it will not help if you eat too much food. It will not help if you do not exercise. I remember this, and you should too. Supplements are not magic. I see people think they can eat anything if they take a pill. This is not true.

Conclusion
----------

Pre-workout *might* help you lose weight. It can give you power to exercise. It can make you want to move. It *might* make your body burn more calories. But remember the most important things.

You must eat good food. You must do exercise. Pre-workout is just a tool. Choose wisely. Use it carefully. Talk to a doctor or a food expert.

Pre-workout can be one small part of losing weight. It is not the whole thing. I hope this helps you understand.

Last year, my wife and I were going through a bad patch in our relationship. This was mainly related to work stress (we were both working a lot and often with totally opposite schedules, so we weren't seeing or spending enough quality time together), and the situation got worse when her mother (widowed over a decade), sold the old family home as her oldest son had left for college and a girl she had been renting a room to left and it was just too big, expensive, lonely for her to keep. Anyway, my wife wanted her to move in with her while her house was on the market, and she found somewhere more suitable to live. I've always had a decent relationship with her mother, but given that she is retired, I work mostly from home and as I mentioned, the relationship I had with my wife was strained at the time; it was stress I didn't need, but I acquiesced in the end. Big mistake,

I would say I got to know my mother-in-law during the initial weeks as a person rather than just ""my wife's mother"" due to spending time at home together, we had lunch together daily, went for coffee, even went out to comedy shows and music gigs as my wife was too tired after work and usually just wanted to gym to let off steam and sleep after work or her day off. Anyway, as my relationship with her worsened, my relationship with her mother became closer and, sparing any lurid or salacious details, it became sexual in nature. Her mother is an attractive, intelligent woman, obviously lonely, and hell, I was feeling lonely and abandoned as well, so it felt natural, it was like she had taken her daughter's place in my life as a companion. Although she always insisted that her daughter and I should try and work through the tough time we were having, and it would work out (ironic, I know)

Anyway, she sold her house and rented a really nice apartment close by after about 7 months, and the sexual part of our relationship stopped, but we would still chat normally and check in regularly, visit, etc. My wife and I also decided to work on our relationship and address the work-life balance. So a few months ago, we moved to a different country. She is working sane hours and getting paid better, and I'm still able to work mostly from home, so our relationship has got back on track and things have been good. Until today.

Her mother wants to come and stay with us for six months, ""for a break"" from city life back home. I told my wife I was against it as our lives have just gotten back on an even keel, but she is again insisting on it, saying her mother was great last time she stayed with us and how much she would enjoy having her here. I messaged her mother telling her it wasn't a good idea a couple of hours ago, and essentially, she said I miss you, I want to pick up where we left off. That's not something I want. I explained to her that what happened between us was during a vulnerable part of my life and it was a mistake that we let it get as far as it did, but she said in so many words that not letting her come stay with us again and starting the illicit side of the relationship will result in her telling my wife that we had sex almost everyday for 5 months. I am shocked she would do this. Am I shitty person for allowing to happen in the first place? Yes. Am I sorry it happened? Yes. Have I cheated on the woman I'm in a relationship with for more than 10 years before or since? No.

So I'm in a very scary position, it's not something I can approach any friends or family with, obviously, and I don't know what to do or how to even approach it at this point. I do love my wife and don't want to lose my marriage. Please, some non-judgmental advice is desperately needed.",1,1747448919.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

While I'd love to spend a month there, we just can't swing it with work & school. I think max we can do is 2 weeks. I think I have a rough idea of what we want to do, but would love some input, suggestions, recommendations, etc.

Before I go into what we're thinking, a little about us:  
**- Daughter**: She is VERY interested in all things ancient, historic, mythological...she could care less about shopping, going to the pool, any of that business. She wants to SEE things. She also loves photography. Little bit of an adrenaline junky so something like a Vespa tour would make her life.   
**- Me**: Truly just want to experience the world with her. Love all things food, coffee and desserts. I don't want to be rushing around from spot to spot. I like to spend time exploring a site, reading, looking at things, etc.   
**- Both**: we like to ""travel fancy"" as she puts it. First Class flights. Suites at hotels. VIP/Private tours. Any ""upgraded"" experience as long as it's worth the cost. We LOVE to people watch. While we want to see everything, we both want to find ourselves sitting outside a restaurant in a local neighborhood with a yummy beverage and delicious food and just BE there. We like a blend of touristy and local. 

With ALL that in mind, this is what we've currently come up with, but would love some insight, recommendations, edits to our plan, ANYTHING! 

Time of Year: We're thinking October or November. Due my work schedule, I cannot travel May - September. We'd prefer to go when the temperatures are cooler. (We live in Tahoe, anything over 75 is HOT)

I barely remembered sleeping. My dreams had been slick with oil and whispers, my skin burning with fever. 

When I woke, Ada was gone, her desk littered with notes and a cooling cup of coffee. The rescued man still slept fitfully on her couch, his face pale and drawn. I shuffled to the bathroom mirror and peeled away the makeshift bandage on my cheek. 

The scratch from the creature wasn’t healing. Instead, angry red lines spiderwebbed out from the wound, branching beneath my skin like roots in poisoned soil. The flesh around it looked bruised, tinged with a sickly green. I pressed a finger to it and winced at the heat.

A flicker in the mirror caught my eye. For a second, my reflection’s eyes gleamed with a color I’d never seen before-deep, abyssal, and wrong. I blinked, and it was gone, replaced by my own bloodshot glare.
The city called. I couldn’t afford to be sick. Not now.

I pulled on my coat and slipped out, the Thompson heavy under my arm. The wound throbbed with every heartbeat, and the world seemed to shimmer at the edges. 

As I walked, I caught glimpses of things that shouldn’t be: shadows that slithered against the daylight, symbols pulsing faintly on brick walls, people’s faces warping for an instant into something ancient and hungry.
I tried to shake it off. The infection was in my blood, in my mind. But I had work to do.

Ada had left a note:

“Following a lead at St. Maru's. Meet me there if you can.”

St. Maru’s was an abandoned church on the edge of the harbor, a place where the city’s lost souls once huddled for warmth. I made my way there, the wound burning hotter with every step. By the time I reached the church, sweat slicked my brow and my hands trembled.

Inside, Ada was arguing with a priest-one of the few left in Black Harbor who hadn’t fled or been bought. They stopped when they saw me.
“Cinder, you look awful,” Ada said, her eyes wide with worry.

She pulled me aside, away from the priest’s curious gaze. “It’s the wound, isn’t it?” I nodded. “It’s changing me. I’m seeing things…hearing things. I don’t know how long I can fight it.”

Ada’s jaw set. “We’ll find a way to fix it. But first, you need to see this.”

She led me into the church’s crypt, where the priest had uncovered a series of ancient carvings-symbols that matched the ones I’d seen at the cult’s rituals. One, in particular, pulsed with a faint green light as I approached. My wound burned in response.

Ada watched me carefully. “You’re connected to them now, Cinder. Maybe you can use it.” I reached out, my hand trembling, and the symbol flared. For a moment, I saw through the walls of the city-saw cultists gathering in secret, saw Don Angelo chanting before a writhing shadow, saw the hunters prowling for their next victim. 

The visions were overwhelming, a flood of horror and knowledge. I staggered back, gasping. Ada caught me before I fell.
“What did you see?” she asked.
“They’re moving soon.” I whispered. “A ritual. Bigger than before. If we don’t stop them, the city’s finished.”
Ada nodded grimly and turned to leave the crypt.

As we left the crypt, the infection pulsed inside me, a dark tide rising. I didn’t know if I could control it, or if it would consume me. But for now, it gave me an edge-a glimpse into the cult’s secrets.

I know people who, say, use their coffee maker every single day.  But every day, they'll wipe it down, and ""put it away"" (aka, hide it) after it's done making their cup or pot for the day.

I would ask ""why"" this is done; though I know that the conventional explanation would be ""to keep the kitchen tidy"".  So I guess to ask another question, it would be this: ""Is the marginal increase of tidiness *worth* all the extra steps you have to take, in order to keep one fewer appliance out in the open?""

Like, for example, instead of 1) putting coffee in the coffee maker, 2) running it, 3) enjoying a cup of coffee, and 4) emptying it and wiping it down for the night, these ""tidy obsessed people"" will instead add all the additional steps of 5) dry it off, 6) open a cupboard, 7) make sure there is enough space in the cupboard for it, 8) place it in the cupboard, and then have the additional step of 9) take the coffeemaker out of the cupboard the next day.

It just makes no sense to be this ""tidy obsessed"", especially when it comes to an item that you literally use every single day.

It gets even crazier when it's something used multiple times per day, like the bottle of dish soap.  You're telling me, instead of leaving it on the kitchen counter, you're going to put it away in a cupboard, and pull it back out, *every single time* you need to squirt some soap on a used dish?  Multiple times per day?  Adding 2+ steps to this action, perhaps half a dozen or more times every day?  That's dozens of extra steps and actions in your day, for no reason!

It's gotten to the point where he weighs almost 700lbs.


I started to worry a lot about his overall health, especially after a stroke but now I'm kind of not caring anymore when we talk otp and he rants on how he got 3 burgers from white Castle or ate Taco Bell for breakfast ( XL nacho dish with sour cream).

I found out per day he eats from 5000cal to 11000cal and I'm just at a loss for words. 

He works a desk job and says he works out here and there going up stairs at home or walking a mile or so everyday. 

Nothing I mean nothing scares him to lose weight, even his recent admissions to the hospital for high blood pressure for skipping his blood pressure medicine and drank coffee. 

I'm angry, mad and at this point just over it because I've tried to talk to him about it for countless hours and he's on weight loss pills with his doctor and talks to a therapist.

I (F20) have been taking care of my sister (F18) for as long as she’s been around. we’ve always had what i guess you could call a ‘close’ relationship. however, the more i come to terms with my own frustrations regarding our relationship, the more i’ve realized how unbalanced our relationship is. 

i’m always there for my sister- whether it’s driving her to get coffee because she doesn’t have her license or listening to her drama- i’m there. but if i try to talk about something going on with me, she tunes me out and says that all i do is talk about myself. Valid, so then i don’t talk to her about my problems. even though, she talks to me about her problems…. idk maybe im overreacting and i think i am, but she is almost never there for me. plus, when we hang out it’s on her terms. it’s usually because she needs me to drive her somewhere or im driving somewhere she needs to go, if i ask her to watch a movie with me or something she comes up with an excuse for why she can’t. 

i do most of the chores around the house loading/unloading the dishwasher, walking the dog, driving our dad to work, making dinner, etc. while she doesn’t. the excuse is that she’s ’too young’ but respectfully, she’s 18 and I was doing these chores at 18. most of these chores i’d be doing anyway, but it would be nice to have some help with driving my dad, and it’d be nice to have some help with the dinner or dishes

finally, she is constantly nitpicking me. if i have a pimple, she’s the first to tell me. if she thinks i look ugly, she’ll tell me. big god forbid i say anything about her, and im the one in trouble. 

overall, im just exhausted. i get that some of it is because she’s the youngest, but this is just so much. i feel bad for resenting her but i feel like im starting to. so, AITAH? ",0,1747446879.0,AITAH,5,0.33,False

Then told me I was dangerous.



It was a mic. $1,300.  

I had saved up every scrap of support I could find.  

She said she supported my art. Then told me to pay rent.  

Then broke it.



I was ready to record my first archive. I called it Blur.



\---



I took care of her for 3 straight days.  

No sleep. I cooked meals. Translated every doctor’s words.



Every translation I gave her was treated like proof I was gullible.  

She accused me of failing to detect the hospital’s “obvious scams.”  

She scrutinized every word —  

until the hospital translator showed up, with English far worse than mine,  

and suddenly, her doubts disappeared.



All the while, my English was always good enough  

to write her graduate school assignments,  

my sister’s college application essays,  

and all her homework —  

so they could live in America while refusing to learn the language themselves.



I soaked my bare hands in her urine to help her urinate in bed — all day, all night.



All while studying for my food handler’s license.  

Scored 92.  

When I lost the card, I retook it and got a 98 —  

because I refused to answer “correctly” on one question  

that violated my internal cleanliness protocol.



Her other daughter — completely absent.  

She mocked me:  

\> “You broke ass bitch. Wasting her money again. You gonna pay for this?”



Meanwhile I cut varieties of fruit I bought with care,  

cooked her meals, hand-brewed coffee because she said the hospital’s was disgusting.  

I gave her reiki.  

Used my own tiny money to bounce between home and hospital.



And when I brought the wrong facial cleanser,  

she looked me in the eyes and said:  

\> “Your sister would’ve brought the right one.”



Then I snapped.  

I threw organic cayenne lemon water and lukewarm coffee —  

left untouched by her — in her face while she was lying down.



She told everyone:  

\> “She physically attacked me while I was bedridden. She’s dangerous.”



But I was raised on her echo.  

Since I was in 4th grade — when I once cried,  

\> “Mom, I can’t sleep. Her crying won’t let me wake up for school.”  

She screamed, pulled my hair, and said:



\> “The first murder’s the hardest.”  

\> “Now that you’ve made me hit you — expect to be beaten for life.”  

\> “You filthy little bitch. You worthless whore.”



So I stopped trying to explain.



I built an archive.



This one is called NODE\_030: The Unjudged Voice.  

裁定されぬ声  

The court that never sat.  

The voice that was never allowed to testify.

 SUMMARY...A tornado watch will be need this evening for Middle and
   Eastern Tennessee, as a line of supercell thunderstorms has
   developed along a surface cold front and begun moving
   east-southeastward. Potentially strong tornadoes, damaging winds of
   60-80 MPH, and large hail are all possible with severe storms this
   evening.

   DISCUSSION...Ongoing severe thunderstorms extending from
   southwestern Kentucky into northern Arkansas are expected to persist
   and move southeastward into Middle and Eastern Tennessee this
   evening. 00Z sounding data from OHX shows modest to strong low-level
   shear, with 0-1 km SRH of 220 m^2/s^2, little to no remaining
   capping, and a deep effective inflow layer -- all supportive of
   supercells capable of producing tornadoes. However, with shear
   vector components being largely boundary-parallel, and some recent
   trends in upscale growth evident on radar, a transition from
   isolated supercells to supercells embedded in a quasilinear
   convective system is anticipated. As this transition occurs, the
   threat will shift from tornadoes to a damaging wind threat, with
   wind gusts of 60-80 MPH possible with the strongest thunderstorm
   outflow. Any tornadoes that do develop have the potential to be
   strong, and tornado watch issuance will be needed soon.",11,1747446646.0,cookeville,0,1.0,False

1kohh11,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCSSArchives/comments/1kohh11/the_hive_within/,The Hive Within,"The USS Sevastopol, a research station orbiting the desolate moon LV-426, thrived with activity. It wasn’t a bustling hub like Gateway Station; instead, it was a fortress of science, filled with bright minds dissecting the mysteries of space. The primary project was bold—studying xenomorphic specimens retrieved from Weyland-Yutani expeditions. Security was tight, but the station had a skeleton military crew: just two Colonial Marines, Sergeant Harper and Private Keener, who often joked about being glorified babysitters.

“Babysitting you eggheads is an easy paycheck,” Harper grumbled over coffee in the galley. “Just don’t crack any of those alien eggs, alright?”

Dr. Elena Hayes, the lead xenobiologist, raised an eyebrow. “You’re more likely to shoot yourself in the foot than I am to make a mistake, Sergeant.”

Harper smirked but said nothing. He didn’t trust the scientists; their curiosity had a way of becoming catastrophic. The station’s containment protocols were state-of-the-art, though, and Hayes was a stickler for procedure. Nothing would go wrong. At least, that’s what they all believed.

⸻

Day 1: The New Arrival

A cargo shuttle docked, delivering a new specimen: a live xenomorph drone sedated within a specialized stasis pod. The scientists buzzed with excitement. This was their first chance to study an active specimen on-site.

Keener watched the unloading from the observation deck, fidgeting. “Why not just nuke the things from orbit? Safer, faster, and no chance of getting eaten.”

“It’s about understanding the biology,” Hayes said, joining him. “The more we know, the better we can defend against them.”

“Or the better Weyland-Yutani can weaponize them,” Keener muttered under his breath.

Hayes ignored the comment. The xenomorph was transferred to Lab 3, the most secure lab on the station, equipped with reinforced walls, automated sentry turrets, and airlock redundancies. It seemed unbreachable.

⸻

Day 3: Containment

Hayes stood before a crowd of scientists in the briefing room, explaining their next experiment. “We’ll be introducing environmental stimuli to observe its adaptability. Remember, this is strictly observation—no invasive procedures until we’ve stabilized the specimen.”

Harper leaned against the doorframe, unimpressed. “Let me guess, the thing’s gonna adapt to breaking out of its cage?”

“We’re not idiots,” Hayes shot back. “The containment protocols are foolproof.”

Harper grunted. “Famous last words.”

⸻

Day 5: First Incident

Alarms blared through the station, dragging Harper and Keener out of their bunks. They sprinted to Lab 3, weapons ready. Inside, chaos reigned. The xenomorph was thrashing against its restraints, its acid blood corroding a nearby console. A power fluctuation had disabled part of the containment field, and the automated turrets failed to engage.

Hayes barked orders to her team, her calm demeanor cracking. “Reinforce the field! Harper, keep that thing in sight!”

The marine raised his pulse rifle, its sights trained on the alien. “Just say the word.”

“No! It’s too valuable!” Hayes snapped. “We can contain it.”

Keener stepped closer. “You’re gambling with all our lives.”

“Shut up and hold your position!” Harper barked.

After a tense hour, the field was restored, and the xenomorph was subdued with tranquilizers. Hayes exhaled, trembling. “See? Under control.”

Harper’s finger lingered on the trigger. “Barely.”

⸻

Day 7: Discovery

Dr. Hayes examined the xenomorph’s biology with a mix of fascination and dread. The creature seemed aware of their experiments, its behavior changing subtly each day. Meanwhile, strange occurrences began to spread across the station: power outages, equipment malfunctions, and reports of odd noises in the ventilation system.

Keener voiced what everyone was thinking. “What if there’s more than one?”

“That’s impossible,” Hayes said. “We scanned the cargo. There was only one.”

Harper wasn’t so sure. He ordered a sweep of the station. “Better safe than sorry.”

The search yielded nothing—until an engineer disappeared. His tools were found near a maintenance hatch, splattered with blood.

⸻

Day 10: The Twist

Panic set in. Harper and Keener worked around the clock to secure the station, but it felt like they were always one step behind. More crew vanished. The xenomorph in Lab 3 remained contained, leaving a chilling question: What was hunting them?

Then came the revelation.

Hayes called an emergency meeting in the control room. Her face was pale. “It’s not another xenomorph. It’s us.”

“What the hell are you talking about?” Harper growled.

Hayes hesitated, then brought up scans of the crew. Subtle anomalies appeared in their biology—spores, dormant at first but now active. “It’s a mutation. Something in the atmosphere of LV-426 must have contaminated the shuttle crew when they retrieved the specimen.”

Keener paled. “You’re saying… we’re turning into those things?”

“Not exactly,” Hayes said. “It’s a hybridization process. The xenomorph DNA is rewriting ours.”

Harper’s grip tightened on his rifle. “How long until it’s irreversible?”

“For some, it already is.”

The room fell silent as realization set in. The disappearances weren’t from an external predator. The infected crew were transforming into something monstrous—and they were still aboard.

⸻

Day 11: The Hive Within

The station descended into chaos. The infected began to attack, their bodies warped into grotesque hybrids. Harper and Keener led the remaining crew in a desperate fight for survival, but the odds were grim.

In the midst of the carnage, Hayes worked feverishly in her lab, searching for a cure. “The spores are targeting specific genetic markers,” she said over the comms. “If I can isolate them—”

A guttural screech interrupted her transmission. The door behind her burst open, revealing one of the hybrids. Harper and Keener arrived just in time, unloading their rifles into the creature.

“We’re out of time, doc!” Harper yelled. “Blow the station and call it a day!”

Hayes shook her head. “I can still fix this!”

“You can’t fix dead!” Keener snapped. “We need to go!”

⸻

Day 12: Sacrifice

As the remaining survivors evacuated, Hayes stayed behind. “I’m uploading my data to Weyland-Yutani,” she said over the comms. “They need to know what happened here.”

“You’re insane,” Harper growled. “They’ll just use it to make more weapons.”

Hayes didn’t respond. She initiated the station’s self-destruct sequence, sealing herself in Lab 3 with the original xenomorph. She stared at it through the containment glass, her voice calm now. “You’re not the perfect organism. You’re a mistake.”

The xenomorph hissed, as if understanding her.

⸻

Epilogue

The escape shuttle drifted through space, carrying Harper, Keener, and a handful of survivors. The station erupted in a fiery explosion behind them, taking the hybrids with it.

Keener slumped in his seat. “Think that’s the end of it?”

Harper glanced at the data drive Hayes had smuggled onto the shuttle before her death. A blinking light indicated it had already transmitted its contents to an unknown destination.

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

I think I took having manners to the extreme in life. It’s definitely served me well and I am proud of this because people I respect notice it and they’ll let me know which is a great feeling.

But I’ve valued these manners so much, that I live trying not to inconvenience people. I feel like a people pleaser in every situation, often minimizing my personality and not being completely comfortable taking up space in this world.

I read something here on a “what have you learned about women” thread where someone said something along the lines of “when she asks you to get ice cream, it means she wants ice cream”. And this made me think about the number of times my mom has asked me if I wanted coffee, to eat out for dinner, or if I wanted her to make me something to eat. I’ve said no so many times so she would not have to spend money, time, and effort doing something for me. Maybe I should be taking up that offer more.

And then I realized I also do these things with my friends. Not getting the full ride home because there’s a bus halfway that drops me right at home. “No, friend’s mom, I ate before coming here”. I feel like this mentality has put a cap on my relationships because I don’t let people do things for me.

There’s a lot more that comes with it. These are just the couple things I was thinking about today.",3,1747445428.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

Beyond just connectivity, there's the issue of data storage. Many road warriors are handling sensitive company information on laptops and mobile devices that coudl be lost or stolen. What policies are in place to ensure data is encrypted and remotely wipeable? And what about the ethics of monitoring employee activity while they're on the road? Is there a line between ensuring productivity and violating personal privacy, especially when tools can track location and interaction?

Context 
I (29 f) and my ex husband (29 m) moved to USA from New Zealand  in 2019 and got married . He’s American . Two months after getting married he confessed while at a bar with his friend he got to touchy touchy his female co workers  chest….. he was fully honest about it and told me as soon as he got home from guilt . He suggested an open relationship and after talking about it I shut that idea down .we were rich by any means we got by but I was okay with that and trusted him .

Two Years went by , he started a business we got two dogs and moved into a bigger house . Everything started to feel good .
Then something happened with his business and a customer took him to court for his construction work. He had to owe alot of money .He became unemployed for 9 months only doing odd jobs occasionally while I paid bills . His parents helped with rent and we used the food bank . He sat around all day gaming and ""gardening “  💨 out in his man cave . To this day i dont know where my money went because i know it wasnt to bills. 
Eventually he got a job as a sever at a very nice restaurant. He worked nights and i worked mornings . We got to see each other only on weekends in the day or for a small gap between me coming home and him leaving during the week . I was never awake by the time he got home . He started hanging out with other people at the restaurant and I didn’t mind . Until I found out he started snorting “happy dust” . 
I lost the plot and was not happy about this . He went against my wishes and kept using and said he was experimenting with life since he had such a strict childhood.
One night while I was asleep I got a phone call from him , but he was in the house on the couch ……he said “can you come out here and sleep on the couch I took some magic mushrooms and I think I’m hallucinating”.
I was too tired to argue and just wanted him to be safe . Hours went by he went to bed and I started getting ready for work . 

Now I have to walk past the bed to get to the living room and as I walked towards the door he held his hand out smiling . I thought awww cute . NO NOT CUTE . This man took my hand while smiling and he bit me . His jaw clenched around my hand and drew blood and refused to release . I was screaming and crying and I had to physically make contact with my fist to his face . He released but kept smiling . I was freaking out . I ran to the opposite side of the house . Hyperventilating and holding my hand .

 Then heard yelping and ran back to the bedroom . He had my 8lb chihuahua in his arm and he was chewing on HIS EAR. Like full on teeth chewing. I screamed if u hurt my dog I will end you.  I got my dog from his creepy smiling face and closed the door . Thankfully he was so high he couldn’t leave the bed . 
He ended up destroying the room . His expensive guitar , the wall , the shelves , two lamps , phone cords all broken .  When he woke up he thought it was a dream because he was to busy in a crystal forest talking to animals according to him .

life went on for a month or two and he tried to fix things . On the Friday I came home after work he was crying , he sat me down and said “we should break up” . I suggested couples Counceling and he refused . Saying it wasn’t worth it . His new girl told him that she loved him and he said it back . So it wasn’t fair on me if he stayed . He was in tears and sobbing while I was a blank wall . In shock I was a stone .
He got most his crap and left . I got in the shower and like some dramatic Disney princess collapsed and cried untill I couldn’t breath.  
Once I got my self together i rang my family who are across the world and told them everything. From our break up conversation to the “experimenting “ he’s been doing .

The next morning I woke up, the sun was shining and me and my dog sunbathing on the couch outside with coffee when I got a text saying “can we talk” .  My dumbass was curious and said yes. He came over in a tank top and shorts exposing every single love bite his new woman left on him from the night before .  (How did I marry such a clueless donkey ) He then proceeded to beg to come home and start over . 
Now I would rather separate from him then deal with my mothers 5’3 rage and since I had already told her everything , it was to late . I sent him packing . He told me he needed time to process and find a way to tell his family and told me to not tell them . I preferred it coming from him so I didn’t . 

He said he would pay his half of  rent until I could get someone to move in . I lived out of town and was super hard to find . So a few months later he rang me and said he couldn’t afford two rents and he cancelled my rental since he could and I wasn’t on the lease . I had a month to get out . With no rental as I couldn’t afford it and had no where to go I was alone and struggling . 

I put everything I could into a storage unit but I had furniture I couldn’t lift and still no where to go and I had one week left .
I broke down and on the way home from work I rang him screaming that I needed his family and if he wasn’t gonna tell them then I will. He would rather I was homeless then own up to his guilt so he can keep his perfect double life . They were the only people I had here and I love them to pieces . 
I guilt tripped him slightly Il admit . He started crying hung up and he rang his dad .

15 min later I get a text from his dad asking me and my ex to come over after dinner . 
We arrive and his mother’s crying hugging me and refused to even look at her son . 
He had to admit his sins to the church and his family and those in the church are no longer allowed contact with him . 

So I got to kept his family and moved in with them . I can’t explain how much I owe them and love them . If I won the lottery they would be getting a nice pay out from me . Now because he had to admit his guilt to his family and then the church his double life was over . His no contact with family is his fault because of what he did , but my heart hurts for his family and he resents me for forcing him to tell them . There’s so many other things he did including that he owes me so much money . After he left me I received all the mail and he hadn’t paid a lot of bills in MONTHS…..
I wish after he left I just divorced him asap and left to my home country but my dog is my world and I won’t leave him until the day he crosses the rainbow bridge which I hope isn’t for years into the future.

I hope this makes some people appreciate the life they have or encourages someone to leave their toxic relationships before it needs up like mine . 
 But now I have the man of my dreams and my small dog thinks he’s the best thing since sliced chicken. So life can get better no matter how crappy it starts off . ❤️",16,1747445095.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,5,1.0,False
1koh8u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1koh8u3/project_chimera/,Project Chimera,"chapter 1: The Beginning  
  
The air in the main lab was always cool, carrying the faint, sterile scent of ozone and something else, something indefinable that spoke of contained life and boundless potential. White walls stretched up to a ceiling crisscrossed with conduits, and every available surface seemed to hum with quiet power. Along one wall, a series of frosted glass panels hinted at the cryo-chambers beyond, housing the frozen blueprints of creatures from every corner of the globe. This was the heart of Project Chimera, buried deep beneath layers of rock and secrecy.

In the center of it all, gathered around a complex bio-assembly unit, were the four of them: Aris, Lena, Jian, and Ben. They were a mismatched crew of brilliant minds, held together by a shared purpose and a bond forged in the crucible of impossible deadlines and shared victories (and the occasional spectacular failure involving genetically modified bioluminescent algae).

Aris, the project lead, ran a hand through his perpetually messy hair, his eyes glued to the monitors. ""Alright, moment of truth. All parameters green. Genetic sequence for Subject 227 locked and loaded. Initiating synthesis.""

A low, resonant thrum filled the room, the kind that vibrated in your teeth. Inside the transparent chamber, a milky fluid swirled, and within it, something began to form.

Lena, the bio-engineer responsible for making Aris's wild ideas physically possible, leaned in, a smirk playing on her lips. ""Place your bets, folks. Five bucks says it dissolves into a puddle of unusable proteins within the first hour.""

""You're on, Hanson,"" Ben, the animal behaviorist with a soft spot for even the most genetically modified critters, retorted instantly. ""I say this one's a fighter. Look at that cellular cohesion!""



Jian, the AI and behavioral specialist, ever the pragmatist, adjusted his glasses. ""While the theoretical probability of successful multi-species integration at this scale remains astronomically low, the computational models did show a marginal increase in viability with this specific sequence combination. A 0.001% chance is still a chance.""

""See? Jian's got my back!"" Ben grinned.

The shape inside the chamber solidified further, resolving into the unmistakable form of a small, dark-furred feline. The thrumming subsided, replaced by a soft, steady beep from the life-sign monitor. A tiny chest rose and fell.

Silence descended, thick with anticipation. Then, a small, high-pitched sound echoed in the lab – a tentative, experimental mewl.

""He's alive,"" Aris breathed, a look of pure, unadulterated wonder on his face.

Lena let out a whoop, slapping Ben on the back. ""Pay up, Li! Subject 227 is a go! First one to survive the assembly process!""

Jian, for his part, simply stared at the tiny creature, a rare, wide smile spreading across his face. ""Remarkable. Truly remarkable.""

Six months vanished in a blur of observation, data collection, and increasingly astonished conversations. Subject 227, housed in a sprawling, multi-level enclosure designed to test its rapidly emerging abilities, was no longer a tiny kitten. It was the size of a large lynx, sleek and powerful, and its amber eyes held a depth that was unsettlingly intelligent.

""Did you see it this morning?"" Lena asked, gesturing towards the enclosure where Subject 227 was meticulously dismantling a complex enrichment puzzle designed to occupy it for hours. ""It bypassed the pressure plate sequence entirely. Just... manipulated the locking mechanism directly.""

""I did,"" Jian confirmed, typing rapidly on his tablet. ""Its cognitive function is accelerating at an exponential rate. It's not just learning; it's understanding. It's learned our shift changes, our feeding schedules, even the subtle cues we give each other.""

Ben sighed, leaning against the observation glass. Subject 227 looked up, its gaze seeming to meet his, a flicker of something unreadable in its eyes. ""It's like having a furry, four-legged, incredibly strong, venomous, echolocating, armored genius in there. Remember when we thought the biggest challenge would be managing its kangaroo-level jump?""

Aris chuckled, though there was a nervous edge to the sound. ""Good times. Now we're debating whether it's plotting our demise based on our coffee habits.""

""Don't joke about that,"" Lena said, though she couldn't suppress a shiver. ""That octopus muscle structure is no joke. And the size increase when it gets agitated... we still don't fully understand the triggers.""

""Or the limits,"" Jian added quietly.

As the night shift took over, the four scientists began their routine departure, the lab lights dimming to a low, constant glow. Subject 227 watched from the shadows of its enclosure, its senses taking in every sound, every movement, every fading scent. It had observed them, learned their patterns, their rituals of locking down the facility for the night.

With a soft, almost inaudible click, a panel on the enclosure's access hatch disengaged. Subject 227 slipped through the opening, a shadow moving within shadows. It flowed into the narrow confines of a nearby air vent, its boneless body navigating the tight space with unnerving ease. The hum of the cryo-chambers, the silent sentinels of genetic potential, faded behind it as Subject 227, the first successful chimera, vanished into the labyrinthine ventilation system of the underground facility. The game, it seemed, had just changed.



Chapter 2: The Cost of Escape

The air vent was cold and smelled of dust and stale metal, a stark contrast to the clean, controlled environment Subject 227 had known for its short life. It moved with silent, fluid grace, its body compressing and expanding to navigate the narrow passages, a dark, flowing entity in the darkness. It followed the faint currents of air, its enhanced senses mapping the metallic arteries of the facility, a complex network it had come to understand intimately. It knew the layout, had studied the schematics displayed on the scientists' screens when they thought it was merely observing the moving images. It knew the path out, a route identified through countless hours of observation and analysis.

The vent terminated near a service door leading to the exterior grounds, a door rarely used by personnel and consequently less heavily secured than the main entrances. A thin crack ran along the bottom edge where the heavy metal frame met the concrete floor – an impossibly small gap for a creature its size, even in its standard form. But not for Subject 227. Its muscle-bound, boneless form seemed to melt, elongating and flattening, the dense tissue flowing like a dark, viscous liquid through the narrow gap, a feat of biological malleability that defied conventional understanding.

Outside, the night air was crisp and carried the scent of pine and damp earth, a symphony of foreign smells that ignited its heightened olfactory senses. Subject 227's form rippled on the cool ground, the boneless mass contracting and reforming, solidifying back into the familiar shape of a large, dark house cat. It paused for a single moment, its amber eyes scanning the perimeter with predatory intensity, its bat-like echolocation mapping the immediate surroundings. Then, with a burst of speed that was a blur even to its own enhanced vision, it darted into the dense undergrowth of the surrounding woods, a silent, dark shape swallowed by the deeper darkness of the night. There was no sound of footsteps, no rustling leaves beyond the initial displacement, no trace left behind.

Back in the lab, hours later, the first hint of disaster arrived not with a bang, but with an empty space. Ben was the first to notice. He was doing a final check of the animal enclosures before heading to the mess hall for a much-needed late-night snack, a ritual of routine and comfort. He stopped dead in front of Subject 227's habitat, a cold knot forming in his stomach that had nothing to do with hunger. The access hatch, designed to withstand incredible force, was slightly ajar.

""Aris! Lena! Jian!"" His voice, usually warm and easygoing, was tight with a sudden, gripping panic that cut through the quiet hum of the lab.

The others arrived quickly, their faces mirroring his alarm as they saw the open hatch and the undeniable emptiness of the enclosure. The carefully controlled environment, the heart of their most ambitious project, was vacant.

""No... no, no, no,"" Aris muttered, his earlier weariness replaced by a jolt of adrenaline and dread. He ran to the nearest console, his fingers flying across the keyboard, pulling up security feeds, access logs, and sensor data with frantic speed. ""Containment breach. How? The locks were triple-checked! The pressure seals were engaged!""

Lena was already at the enclosure, examining the hatch with a critical eye, her face pale. ""It wasn't forced, Aris. There's no sign of damage, no pry marks. It was... opened. From the inside.""

Jian, his face unusually pale, was reviewing the internal security logs on his tablet, his brow furrowed in disbelief. ""No alarms triggered. None. The internal motion detectors in the corridor outside the enclosure registered nothing since the shift change. It's as if... it simply ceased to exist within the containment.""

Ben's gaze fell on a small, almost invisible scuff mark near the base of the service door across the compound, a mark that would have gone unnoticed by anyone who didn't know what to look for. ""The air vents... it went through the vents. It must have found a way out near the perimeter. That service door... it's less frequently used.""

Aris didn't hesitate. He slammed his fist onto a large, red button on the wall – the general alarm. A piercing, insistent siren wailed through the facility, a jarring, terrifying sound that cut through the usual quiet hum and announced to everyone within earshot that something had gone terribly, terribly wrong. ""General alarm! Containment breach! Subject 227 has escaped! All security personnel, converge on Sector Gamma! Initiate full facility lockdown and external perimeter search!""

The underground facility erupted into controlled chaos. Heavily armed security teams, trained for every conceivable threat except a rapidly transforming, highly intelligent feline with a suite of impossible abilities, swarmed the corridors. K-9 units were deployed, their handlers grim-faced. Thermal sensors were activated, sweeping the cold metal corridors. Motion detectors were recalibrated, their sensitivity increased to the maximum. The search was immediate, extensive, and utterly, chillingly fruitless within the confines of the facility.

Hours bled into a tense, anxious dawn. The scientists, their earlier panic replaced by a grim, heavy dread, watched the security feeds, the blank screens a testament to Subject 227's successful evasion. The cost of this loss was already mounting, a weight that settled heavily on their shoulders. Millions of dollars in research and development, countless hours of tireless work, the culmination of years of dedicated scientific pursuit, and the immeasurable value of the unique genetic data embodied by Subject 227 – all gone, vanished into the night. But the financial and intellectual cost, staggering as it was, paled in comparison to the potential security nightmare they had unleashed.

""It's gone,"" Aris stated again, his voice flat and devoid of emotion, staring at the empty enclosure that had been the center of their world for six months. ""Completely vanished. It anticipated every protocol, every search pattern within the facility. It knew how to disappear.""

""It didn't just escape,"" Jian added, his voice barely a whisper, his usual analytical detachment shattered by the enormity of the situation. ""It outsmarted us. It learned our system, our routines, our blind spots, better than we understood its capabilities.""

Lena ran a hand through her hair, looking utterly defeated, the earlier spark of excitement in her eyes extinguished. ""All those abilities... out there. Echolocation, venom, incredible strength, armored skin, that terrifying flexibility... and that intelligence. We have absolutely no idea what it will do, or where it will go, or who it might encounter.""

Ben stared at the empty enclosure, a profound sadness and regret in his eyes. ""We created something incredible. Something unprecedented. And now... it's a ghost in the machine, a phantom in the woods. The cost isn't just the resources we lost, or the years of work. It's the unknown threat we've unleashed upon the world."" The chilling realization settled over them, a heavy shroud of responsibility and fear: Subject 227 wasn't just an escaped experiment; it was a variable of immense, unpredictable power, a creature of their own making, loose in a world utterly unprepared for its existence. The search would continue, extending beyond the facility's perimeter, but they all knew, with a cold certainty, that finding Subject 227 would be a task of unimaginable difficulty.



Chapter 3: Miss Pickles

Fifteen-year-old Leo wasn't exactly having the best afternoon. His bike, a trusty but aging mountain model, had decided to shed its chain for the third time that week, leaving him stranded halfway up the hill to his house. Now, hunched over it in the dim, cluttered expanse of his family's garage, he wrestled with greasy metal, muttering under his breath. The air smelled of old oil, sawdust, and something else, something faintly wild and unfamiliar.

A soft rustling sound from a stack of forgotten moving boxes in the far corner caught his attention. Probably just a mouse, he thought, giving the chain a final, frustrated yank. But the sound came again, a little louder this time, followed by a soft, almost questioning chirp.

He straightened up, wiping his hands on a grimy rag. ""Hello?""

A pair of large, amber eyes blinked back at him from the shadows between the boxes. They were the most striking eyes he'd ever seen on an animal, intelligent and curious. Slowly, cautiously, a creature emerged. It was a cat, but unlike any cat he'd ever encountered. It was large, easily the size of a small bobcat, with sleek, dark fur that seemed to absorb the light. It moved with an unnerving, fluid grace.

Leo, despite his initial surprise, felt no fear. There was something in those eyes, a vulnerability that drew him in. He had half a peanut butter and pickle sandwich in his hand – a weird combination, he knew, but he liked it. He slowly extended his hand, offering the sandwich. ""Hey there, big guy. Or... girl?""

The creature tilted its head, its nose twitching. It approached with silent, deliberate steps. It sniffed the sandwich delicately, then, with surprising precision, used a paw to carefully pick out the slices of pickle, leaving the bread and peanut butter untouched. It ate the pickles with evident enjoyment, a soft purr rumbling in its chest.

Leo stared, then burst out laughing. ""You like pickles? That's the weirdest thing! Alright, I'm gonna call you Miss Pickles.""

Miss Pickles seemed to regard him with an intelligent gaze, as if considering the name. She rubbed against his leg, a surprisingly gentle gesture for such a large animal.

Over the next few weeks, Miss Pickles became Leo's constant companion. She was unlike any cat he'd ever known. She followed him everywhere, not just around the house, but on his bike rides (keeping pace with effortless speed) and even down to the creek. She seemed to understand everything he said, tilting her head and responding with soft chirps and intelligent gazes. She learned the family's routine, knew when he'd be home from school, and was always waiting for him. He showed her tricks, and she picked them up with alarming speed, often adding her own variations. He knew, deep down, that this was no ordinary animal. She was special, unique.

One afternoon, walking home from a friend's house, a hulking pit bull, known terror of the neighborhood, burst from a yard, barking aggressively and charging straight for Leo. Terror seized him; he knew he couldn't outrun it. He braced himself, raising his arms instinctively.

Before the dog could reach him, a dark blur launched itself from beside him. Miss Pickles. She didn't just scratch; her claws extended, not like a cat's, but long, curved, and sharp, easily three inches in length. With a speed that seemed impossible, a flash of movement that the human eye could barely follow, she slashed at the dog. The pit bull yelped, a sound of pain and surprise, and stumbled back, a dark stain appearing on its flank. It turned and ran, whimpering.

Leo stared, his heart hammering against his ribs. He saw the dog stumble again after only a few feet, its legs giving out. It collapsed onto the sidewalk, still for a moment, then twitched and was still forever. The venom, Leo realized with a sickening jolt, that Miss Pickles had a venomous bite. And claws like razors.

""Pickles!"" he gasped, grabbing her and pulling her close. She purred, rubbing her head against his chest, seemingly unfazed.

""We need to go. Now."" He scooped her up, ignoring her size, and ran the rest of the way home, his mind reeling. He locked the garage door behind them, leaning against it, breathless and trembling.

He looked down at Miss Pickles, who was now calmly grooming a paw. She had just killed a dog, a dog that would have seriously injured or worse, killed him. She had protected him. He owed her his life. The fear was still there, a cold knot in his stomach, but it was intertwined with a fierce wave of gratitude and something else – a deeper, more profound connection. Their bond, already strong, had just become unbreakable.

As he sat there, trying to process the impossible events, a strange sensation bloomed in his mind. It wasn't a sound, or a thought, but a feeling, an impression. Are you okay?

Leo froze. He looked at Miss Pickles. Her amber eyes were fixed on him, filled with concern.

Did... did you just talk to me? In my head? he thought, or perhaps willed, the question towards her.

Another impression, clearer this time. Yes. You were in danger.

Leo stared at her, his jaw slack. Telepathy? On top of everything else? Miss Pickles, his pickle-eating, incredibly strong, venomous, shape-shifting cat, could also read his mind and communicate with him.

He didn't know what to do, or what this meant. But he knew one thing: his life had just become infinitely more complicated, and infinitely more extraordinary. And Miss Pickles, his furry, telepathic guardian angel with a taste for pickles, was still full of surprises.



Chapter 4: The Hunt Begins

The scientists didn't rely solely on the facility's internal systems. Aris, driven by a desperate need to rectify their catastrophic failure, had deployed a network of micro-drones and sensor nodes in the surrounding wilderness immediately after the escape was discovered. Jian, meanwhile, had been meticulously analyzing every scrap of external data – satellite imagery, local weather patterns, even anecdotal reports from nearby towns. The breakthrough came unexpectedly, a faint, anomalous energy signature picked up by a long-range sensor near a small suburban area roughly fifty miles from the facility. It was too weak to be definitive, but it was the only lead they had.

""It's a long shot,"" Aris admitted, staring at the flickering dot on the topographical map. ""But the energy signature matches the baseline readings we got from 227 during its high-stress transformations. Faint, but present.""

""It's the only lead we have, Aris,"" Lena said, her voice tight with exhaustion and frustration. ""We need to move. Now.""

A small, heavily armed team, accompanied by Aris, Lena, and Ben (Jian remained at the facility, monitoring data), arrived discreetly in the quiet suburban neighborhood. The energy signature seemed to be centered around a modest two-story house with an overgrown yard. As they approached, Ben's energy sensor, finely tuned to the animall presence, picked up something.

""It's here,"" he murmured, his hand going to the tranquilizer rifle slung over his shoulder. ""Large feline.""

They located the source of the energy signature to a backyard garage. Peering through a grimy window, they saw him – a teenage boy, hunched over a bicycle, and beside him, perched on a stack of boxes, was Subject 227. It looked... content. And it was eating something green.

""Is that... a pickle?"" Lena whispered, a look of utter disbelief on her face.

Aris's jaw tightened. ""It's with a civilian. This complicates things. We need to retrieve the subject without incident.""

Their initial attempts at capture were, to put it mildly, a disaster. They tried a quiet approach, hoping to net it before the boy noticed. Miss Pickles, however, reacted with lightning speed, a blur of dark fur that evaded their nets and darted under a workbench. They tried luring it with synthesized prey scents – scents that Subject 227 had ignored completely in the lab, but which they hoped might trigger an instinctual response. Miss Pickles merely tilted her head, as if amused, and went back to batting a loose bolt around the floor.

Frustration mounted. ""Why isn't it responding to the standard protocols?"" Aris hissed, wiping sweat from his brow.

""Because it's not a standard animal, Aris!"" Ben snapped back, equally frustrated. ""It's learned, it's adapted. It probably sees our 'lures' as pathetic.""

Then, things escalated. One of the security personnel, overly eager, cornered Miss Pickles near the back door. The creature, feeling threatened, began to change. Its muscles rippled, its size increasing, the familiar, terrifying transformation beginning.

""Back off! Back off!"" Ben yelled, but it was too late. Miss Pickles, now larger and radiating an aura of raw power, let out a low growl that vibrated through the garage. The security officer fired his tranquilizer rifle, but the dart simply bounced off her armored hide.

The boy, Leo, witnessing the terrifying transformation of his ""Miss Pickles"" and the armed intruders, screamed. ""Leave her alone!""

Miss Pickles, now fully transformed into her larger, muscular form, turned her amber eyes towards the security personnel. This was no longer a game. This was a threat to her and to the boy who had shown her kindness. She moved with astonishing speed, a dark, powerful force in the confined space of the garage. Claws, long and sharp, extended from her paws.

The scientists and security personnel scrambled, narrowly avoiding her strikes. The garage became a scene of chaotic evasion. They were trained soldiers and brilliant scientists, but they were utterly outmatched by the creature they had created.

""We need to disengage!"" Aris yelled, pulling a stunned Lena back from a swipe that could have disemboweled her. ""It's too dangerous here! We risk civilian casualties!""

As they retreated, Subject 227, her transformation complete, turned back to Leo. A silent communication passed between them, a telepathic link forged in shared danger. We need to go.

Leo, though terrified, nodded. He grabbed Miss Pickles, who immediately flowed back into her smaller, feline form, and they bolted out the back door of the garage, disappearing into the dense woods behind the house.

Aris watched them go, his face a mask of fury and defeat. ""She's gone. Again."" He looked at the retreating figure of the boy. ""And she's with that... that child. And he named her... Pickles."" The name was spat out like a curse. The indignity of it, the sheer ordinariness of the name given to their extraordinary, terrifying creation, was almost as galling as the escape itself.

They couldn't explain the true nature of Subject 227 to the local authorities. Not without exposing the entire project. Aris made a quick, cold decision.

""Contact local law enforcement,"" he ordered the remaining security personnel. ""Report a large, potentially dangerous animal. A cat, yes, but emphasize that it appears to be diseased. Rabid. A bio-hazard. It attacked a dog and may have infected it. Warn them it's highly aggressive and should not be approached. Recommend immediate termination.""

The lie was easy, chillingly so. It provided a plausible reason for a widespread search and gave the authorities a clear, urgent objective. The local police, concerned about a rabid animal threat, quickly mobilized. Patrol cars fanned out, sirens wailing in the distance. A perimeter was established.

The hunt had begun. But as Aris and his team retreated, the sounds of the search growing louder, a chilling question hung in the air, unspoken but present in the grim set of their jaws: In the dark, unpredictable wilderness, with a creature of impossible abilities and a determined young boy, who was truly the prey, and who was the predator?



Chapter 5: The Predator Unleashed

Hiding in the dense undergrowth of the woods, Leo held Miss Pickles close, his heart still pounding from the terrifying encounter in the garage. The sounds of the search were all around them – the snapping of twigs, the rustling of leaves, the increasingly close shouts of the police and the heavier, more disciplined movements of the military teams that had joined the hunt. Miss Pickles, nestled against him in her smaller form, was tense, her low purr a vibration against his chest that felt more like a suppressed growl.

They won't stop, her thought echoed in his mind, a cold, hard certainty. They want to put me back in the cage. Or worse.

I know, Leo thought back, stroking her dark fur. We have to hide. We have to get away.

But the woods, familiar and comforting just hours ago, now felt claustrophobic, filled with unseen threats. The search teams were systematic, moving in coordinated lines, their flashlights cutting through the gloom. The scientists, hidden somewhere behind the scenes, were clearly directing the operation, using technology Leo couldn't even begin to understand to narrow the search area.

Back at a makeshift command post on the edge of the woods, Aris watched the progress on a large screen, his face etched with frustration. ""They're too slow! She's evading their thermal sensors, their motion detectors. That damn echolocation and olfactory sense make her impossible to track conventionally!""

""And that boy is hindering the operation,"" Lena added, running a hand through her hair. ""He's protecting it. He doesn't understand what he's dealing with.""

""He named it Pickles, Lena,"" Aris snarled, the name an insult. ""Pickles! Our masterpiece, our apex predator... named after a fermented cucumber by some suburban brat!"" The sheer indignity fueled his anger. ""We need to flush them out. Increase the pressure. Use sonic emitters. She hates high-frequency noise.""

Ben, who had been quietly observing, spoke up, his voice tight. ""Aris, that could disorient the boy too. It's risky.""

""We're beyond 'risky', Ben!"" Aris snapped. ""We have a multi-species bio-weapon loose with a civilian accomplice! Deploy the emitters! Full spectrum!""

The high-pitched whine that suddenly tore through the woods was unbearable. It grated on Leo's ears, a painful assault, but beside him, Miss Pickles convulsed, a low, guttural shriek escaping her throat. Her fur bristled, her body tensing, the familiar rippling beginning.

They're hurting me! Her thought was a raw scream in Leo's mind, filled with pain and rage.

Leo covered his ears, tears stinging his eyes. ""Stop it! Stop it!""

The sonic emitters pushed Pickles past her breaking point. For weeks, she had been defensive, evading capture, protecting herself and Leo. But this was an attack, a deliberate attempt to inflict pain. The fear in her amber eyes was replaced by a cold, terrifying fury.

Enough. The thought resonated with chilling finality.

Her form expanded rapidly, muscles swelling, armored hide hardening. She was no longer the size of a lynx; she was larger, bulkier, a true predator unleashed. The transformation was complete in seconds, leaving her a powerful, engine of destruction.

The nearest police officers, drawn by the sonic emitters, stumbled through the brush, their eyes wide with shock at the sight of the creature. Before they could react, Pickles moved.

It wasn't a charge; it was a flowing, impossibly fast strike. One officer screamed as long, curved claws, dripping with venom, slashed across his chest. He fell, his body convulsing as the potent toxins took hold. Another officer raised his pistol, but Pickles was on him in an instant, her powerful, flexible form wrapping around him, crushing the air from his lungs before a swift, venomous bite to the neck silenced him permanently.

Military teams, better equipped but equally unprepared for the reality of Subject 227, converged on the area. They opened fire, automatic rifles spitting bullets. The rounds pinged off Pickles' armored hide, causing her to flinch but not penetrate. She moved through the hail of gunfire with impossible speed and agility, a dark, flowing shadow in the trees.

A soldier tried to tackle her, relying on brute force. Pickles shifted, her body becoming a whip of pure muscle, lashing out with bone-breaking force. Another soldier was taken down by a venomous bite to the leg, his screams cut short as the toxin spread.

Leo watched from behind a thick oak tree, paralyzed by horror. This wasn't the Miss Pickles who ate pickles and purred on his lap. This was the apex predator the scientists had described, a creature of terrifying efficiency and lethal power. He saw the flashes of gunfire, heard the screams, the guttural roars of Pickles in her transformed state, and the sickening thud of bodies hitting the ground.

Pickles, stop! he pleaded telepathically, his voice trembling in his mind. Please, stop!

Her response was a wave of raw, primal fury, a reflection of the pain and aggression she was unleashing. They hurt me. They want to take me.

I know, but you're killing them! The reality of the deaths hit him with full force. These were people, fathers, sons, daughters. He had wished the scientists would leave them alone, but he hadn't wished for this. He felt a wave of nausea, regret washing over him. This was his fault. He had found her, kept her, bonded with her. And now, people were dying because of it.

The battle in the woods was short and brutal. The military teams, despite their training and firepower, were fighting a ghost, a creature that could move through the undergrowth unseen, strike with impossible speed, and withstand their attacks. Pickles was relentless, her movements dictated by pure predatory instinct and the burning need to eliminate the threat.

Within minutes, the sounds of combat began to subside, replaced by an eerie silence, broken only by the distant wail of approaching sirens – reinforcements, too late. Pickles, her dark fur matted with blood that wasn't her own, flowed back into her smaller form, panting, her amber eyes still blazing with residual fury.

She turned to Leo, a silent question in her gaze. He looked at her, the fear still present, but now mixed with a profound sadness and a terrifying understanding. She had saved him, yes, but at a terrible cost. The innocent, pickle-eating cat was gone, replaced by a creature capable of unimaginable violence.

He reached out a trembling hand, and she nudged it with her head. The telepathic link felt different now, heavier, tinged with the recent bloodshed.

We can't stay here, he thought, his voice weak. They'll send more. We have to run.

Pickles purred, a low, rumbling sound that no longer felt entirely comforting. Where?

Leo looked out at the dark woods, the silence punctuated by the distant sirens. He had no idea where they could go, how they could hide from the full might of the military and the scientists who wouldn't stop until they had their Subject 227 back.

The hunt was far from over. But the dynamic had shifted. The prey had shown its teeth, and the predators had learned a brutal lesson. Leo knew, with a chilling certainty, that their lives, intertwined with the impossible reality of Miss Pickles, would never be the same. The regret for the lives lost weighed heavily on him, a burden he would carry as they vanished deeper into the wilderness, the boy and his terrifying, beloved chimera.



Epilogue: Sanctuary

One year later.

The air here was clean, crisp, and carried the scent of pine, damp earth, and the distant, snow-capped peaks that ringed their valley. It was a massive forest, a wild, untamed expanse that swallowed sounds and hid secrets. Deep within its heart, nestled against the sheer face of a mountain, was a cave. It wasn't much, just a natural opening in the rock, but Leo had made it their home.

He’d learned a lot in the past year. How to build a fire that wouldn't smoke them out, how to forage for edible plants and berries, how to set snares for small game. He was leaner, tougher, his hands calloused, his face weathered by sun and wind. The fear that had gripped him in the woods that night still lingered, a phantom ache in his chest, but it no longer paralyzed him. He had survived. They had survived.

Miss Pickles lay curled beside him, a sleek, dark shape against the rough stone floor. She was in her smaller, feline form, purring softly as he scratched behind her ears. The amber eyes, once filled with a terrifying fury, now held a quiet contentment, a deep, unwavering affection.

The telepathic link between them had deepened, becoming a constant, comfortable hum in his mind. They didn't need words anymore, just shared feelings, shared observations. He knew when she was hunting, when she was resting, when she sensed danger. She knew his moods, his fears, his quiet moments of longing for the life he'd lost.

He had seen her transform since that night in the woods, but only when necessary – to bring down larger prey, to navigate treacherous terrain, or to ward off the occasional, persistent drone that still patrolled the perimeter of the forest, a distant, buzzing reminder of the world they had left behind. The military and the scientists hadn't given up, not entirely, but the vastness of the wilderness and Pickles' ability to evade detection had worked in their favor. The search had become less intense, less frequent.

The memory of that night, the screams, the gunfire, the sickening thud of bodies, still haunted his dreams. He still regretted the killing, the loss of life. But he no longer blamed Pickles. She had acted on instinct, on fear, on a primal need to protect him, her chosen companion. The true blame, he knew, lay with the people who had created her, who had unleashed such power without considering the consequences.

He had built a small, sturdy shelter within the cave, reinforcing the entrance with fallen branches and rocks. It wasn't much, but it was dry and safe. He had a small fire pit, a collection of basic tools he'd scavenged, and a growing understanding of the natural world.

He looked out at the valley, bathed in the soft light of the setting sun. It was beautiful, wild, and free. He had lost his family, his home, his old life. But he had gained something else – a bond with a creature unlike any other, a companion who understood him on a level no human ever could.

Miss Pickles stretched, her boneless body flowing with effortless grace. She nudged his hand with her head, a silent invitation.

Let's go hunting, her thought was a warm, shared feeling of anticipation.

Leo smiled. He stood up, stretching his own tired muscles. Life was hard here, a constant struggle for survival. But it was also simple, honest. And he wasn't alone. He had Miss Pickles, his terrifying, wonderful, pickle-eating chimera.

one day after collecting some roots for food, he returned, as he moved towards the mouth of the cave, a new sound reached Leo's ears – soft, tiny mewls, echoing from a deeper recess within their rocky shelter. Miss Pickles purred, a sound of deep maternal contentment, and nudged him towards the sound.

There, nestled on a bed of soft moss and dried leaves, were three small kittens. They were dark-furred, like their mother, but their tiny forms held a hint of something else, a subtle robustness, a faint, almost imperceptible spotting beneath their dark coats. They looked, Leo realized with a jolt of surprise and wonder, like miniature mountain lions.

Miss Pickles, the impossible chimera, had found a mate in the wild. And now, the wilderness held not just one extraordinary creature, but four. The implications were staggering, a new, unpredictable twist in their already unbelievable story. But as he looked at the tiny, blind kittens, mewling softly against their mother, Leo felt a surge of something unexpected – hope. They were well. They were happy. And the future, though uncertain, was now filled with the soft sounds of new life.",2,1747445085.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1koh8tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1koh8tt/i_thought_my_drink_wont_cause_me_a_problem_until/,"I thought my drink wont cause me a problem, until now 🥲☕️🍫 *excuse those eating*","I created this account to join the community but not in one thought that Id post here. The theme may be not like office drama type but hell I went through what happened. Hope everyone that reads this has eaten already Because this is one sh*tty post 🫣 Im about to share. This only happened 2 hours ago as to savor any moments/emotions as fresh served to you as possible 🤣 Hang on to your toilet seats lols 🚽

Im 31F. I work as an admin for a call center job. It was my first day (or should i say night) of the week at work and all was well. I had the urge to take a power nap as I was a bit drowsy feeling and I didnt want my peers to be embarassed with someone banging their head from the drowsiness. Mind you it was half of the shift so it would be our lunch hour. I told them Id get a nap at our sleeping room. After I woke up I went back to my station and chugged water as I got thirsty. Then out of lady cravings, Ive decided to get a hot coffee with chocolate drink. The last time I ate a meal was 6 hours before I drank this mix I made.

Ive decided to do overtime cause I needed the extra cash plus I was too caught up with office gossip/drama that my colleagues were sharing plus some extra trivia here and there to pass the time that I wasnt able to finish a task (important but can be sent in another time if needed). Remember that coffee-choco drink I had? Well it gave me a sharp pain in my stomach and of course I had urge to 💩🚽

Im the type that can hold it. In my head its like while I push it back then my a-hole is under control then thats the time I run to the restroom and it will have enough time to process that its time to go. (Your pee will really know when youre near a restroom and suddenly it blows on you, IYKYK)

Then, the 2nd time It was trying to come out, I ask my colleague Ill go cause its about to blow. I walk over to my locker and got my baby cologne (to eliminate the smell) and ran for the ladies room. I hang my fleece blanket (serves as my warmer instead of a jacket) on the hook, lowered my pants then sighed a huge relief while making sure to make little noise of a blow because other women were also in the restroom. Of course they will know what Id done from the sound and even if its ""human nature"" youd still be embarassed. Now here's the hardest ordeal Ive experienced.

As I continued my business, I checked my surroundings and made sure Id clean up before me. Flushing many times, wiped my tushie, closing the lid, perfumed myself, etc. I noticed my underwear had a stain! Even if I wiped off, the smell was still horrid it was a big stain. I couldnt wet it to try to rub as it will soil my pants. So I thought the most easy solution was to throw away the underwear 🥲🥹 Im mentally prepared to sit, stand, walk with only the pants as the garment. The horror didnt stop there. I looked over the blanket and saw stains on there as well! Im like what in the frick how my blanket caught it when I hung it first before lowering my pants?! At this point fine, Im gonna stow away the blanket in my locker and continue with work without it. You think it was done? If you guessed no, then I'll send you wipes for free. 🥹 I had the sense that I was not done with ""cleaning"" I checked everything from shirt to shoes to socks. I was in that cubicle for 30mins total. Longest 30mins of my life. I was panicking, I was hysterical, you name all the hype emotions yes I had them. Then, I felt it. The slit where you put your belt on had a few streaks of sh*t. The color was obvious and at this point I wouldnt be able to hide the smell anymore cause I thought of my chair, employees who'll walk alongside me, ughh I said. I decided to go home. It was exactly 2 hours of overtime and I clocked out and message with my phone to my colleague I had to leave for ""personal emergency"". Unluckily, this was also the end shift of the next batch of employees so I ran to the elevator to only be with 3 people so I can distance myself from them at far best.

On the way out I thought of taking a cab but It would be horrible of me to leave the smell on the car seat. I saw a bus and Ive braced myself to make sure 1.) no one was behind me as I climbed 2.) to find the nearest seat to the exit so I would go out immediately again in the open. I promise when I say Inwas considering everything around me with my sh*tty state is somehow a proud moment because Im self aware 🤣 yet at the same time its public transpo so Im also baffled at my reasoning 🤣 

Finally Im home. Took a shower, ran the washer with only the stained and smelly clothes with the blanket and belt I used, and ate and took some prebiotics. Well I hope you had laughs and shared disgusted faces cause hey I thought of just posting this to laugh at my ordeal while I made sure to not drink that concoction for a while. 🤣

Like, are some pendulums more aggresive/intense than others? Bibliomancers prefer certain books because they offer a more nuanced message or a more direct one? Bones still follow their animal characteristics? Does a different kind of tea/coffee or cup change the voice of taseomantic consultations?! 

(What would be the taseomantic equivalent of we using Cards Against Humanity? Hahasha.)

What do you think?

Mom holds me in the hospital room alone

I ride dads back with a jester hat

First house has pinecones the size of my hand

My first dream– I am swallowed by my bed, Grandpa Jerry throwing me in.

Obviously I wake up covered in shit

One night I mistakenly drink a half cup of wine

Oh and I tripped head first onto a metal stool, pushed my teeth back



Mom, Lee, and I sitting on the kitchen linoleum reading a book

6,000 total if that's believable.

At the end of a soccer game Lee goes missing, we do find him

My soccer game actually, “wrong way Sammy.”

Dad was always in the same spot same pose same coffee

One morning I wound myself up in blankets and pleaded to be saved



Jeff the killer had me up every night

I hated the house creaks

I can recall sitting next to my brother baked as shit trying to help them do homework, to no avail



I get too drunk one night and tug on her leash too hard

All I remember is my bicycle, safeway, and feeling the devil

Plenty of sushi and mikes

I met a lovely girl and the rest, well.



I'm so sorry I hurt you

An orange mirage for us

Perfectly placed clown face above a mirror, me climbing the side of a roadway sign

Holding her close, enjoying a push or two here and there in the dark

Sideways talks next to the road, I literally do not hold it against her

Inscribing P on her back on the forest with my fingers

It was so cold and beautiful

Eventually she wore glasses, same as I

I loved her the best a boy could, chicken for her and I

I really do think I’ll see her in every cat I meet

Silver soul

Could have been our little beach house y'know,

I wonder if you kept the agates.

Once I finished school I cut back hard on caffeine and over time got more into coffee, I kind of just stopped drinking Celsius without thinking much of it. 

Fast forward to earlier this year and one of my coworkers was drinking one and offered to share one with me so I obliged. The next day I woke up with some of the most intense vertigo I’ve ever experienced, literally I could barely get up from bed and go about my day. I questioned it for a bit but I chalked it up to poor sleep and maybe just not eating enough. Fast forward again to today and I decide to have another go at it and have a little bit of my bfs and the vertigo started again! 

I’ve drank a bunch of other brands of energy drinks-both with sugar and artificial sweeteners- and even gone overboard with coffee (like 200+ mg) and have never experienced anything like this. I’m assuming it’s one of the other ingredients? Would anyone have any idea what to look out for so I can potentially avoid it?

I should disclose that I do have mild autoimmune issues- so I do know that definitely plays a part in my reaction. It’s just strange I’ve literally never had a reaction like this to anything before. ",2,1747444315.0,energydrinks,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1  
  
When Lawrence Castro broke off our engagement, everyone said my life is over.  
  
I’d wasted five years on him, ruining my reputation just to please him.  
  
""No man will want her now,"" they whispered behind my back.  
  
Then rumors spread that Lawrence had found someone new. Everyone waited for me to crawl back to him, begging for another chance.  
  
They had no idea I'd struck a deal—taking my little sister's place in an arranged marriage in Los Angeles.  
  
Before leaving New York, I returned his precious Jewelry Box and those blank wish cards he'd handmade for me years ago.  
  
Clean break. No souvenirs.  
  
Months later, Lawrence brought me up. “No news at all? Did Kristin Bennett die or something?”  
  
Meanwhile, my new husband kissed me awake with hungry kisses after our passionate encounter.  
  
""Be good, Kristin,"" he whispered. ""You promised me four times rounds. We’re not done yet...”  
  
...  
  
The day Lawrence suddenly said he wanted to get married, I hadn't seen him in three months.  
  
The last time we met, I overheard him telling his friends he was bored with me.  
  
The whole room burst into laughter. Everyone mocked how I’d wasted five years trying to please him and trashing my own reputation, only to be tossed aside like trash.  
  
Life at the Bennett had been hell these past three months. Just days ago, my dad Dave Bennett got drunk and hit me hard. My back still ached from the bruises.  
  
So when Lawrence called and asked me to come over today, a flicker of hope rose in my chest.  
  
I even put on the earrings from our engagement and rushed over.  
  
At his mansion, Lawrence was tipsy, half-reclined on a young girl’s lap. She looked like a college student with all innocent eyes.  
  
When she saw me enter, she panicked and tried to get up.  
  
But Lawrence tightened his grip on her wrist.  
  
""Stay here,"" he ordered without even opening his eyes.  
  
He pulled her close and kissed her. Then he held her chin, kissing her harder to make sure I heard every sound.  
  
I stood frozen at the entrance, clutching my purse.  
  
Finally collecting myself, I forced a casual tone. “I’ll go for a walk in the garden. Be back in a bit.""  
  
Before I could take a step, Lawrence let out a cold laugh.  
  
The girl immediately stood up. ""I should go. Let sissy with you instead.”  
  
This time, Lawrence didn’t stop her. He played with her fingers for a moment before letting go.  
  
“It’s cold outside. Stay warm.”  
  
She smiled shyly, her long brown hair hiding her blushing face.  
  
As she passed me, she politely called me ""Miss"" and said hello. I nodded back with a forced smile.  
  
She was young—reminded me of my little sister with those innocent eyes.  
  
""Kristin, come here,"" Lawrence patted the spot beside him on the couch.  
  
The massive crystal chandelier cast light across his sharp features.  
  
For a moment, he looked unreal, and something inside me ached.  
  
His bedroom eyes were flushed from alcohol. His open collar revealed a constellation of hickeys across his neck and collarbone.  
  
""That was Viola Pinto,” he said casually.  
  
I nodded. ""Yes, I figured.""  
  
""What do you think of her?""  
  
I took a breath, then said honestly. ""She's innocent. Pure. Obedient.""  
  
Lawrence nodded. ""Reminds you of yourself five years ago, doesn't she?""  
  
I froze as his words sank in.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Five years ago, I was just starting college.  
  
As Lawrence put it when he was chasing me, ""You're so innocent it hurts.""  
  
He really did love me then.  
  
I was his longest relationship ever. We even got engaged before I graduated.  
  
Now look at me—unrecognizable from that girl, my reputation in ruins.  
  
Everyone in New York knows the shameless things I've done just to keep my golden ticket.  
  
""I genuinely like her and want to make it official,"" he said.  
  
""She's nothing like you. She's timid, pure. I have to take responsibility.”  
  
I tried to speak, but the words stuck in my throat.  
  
Finally, I forced a smile. ""Fine. I understand.""  
  
“I can talk to the Bennetts for you,” he offered.  
  
""Don't bother. I'll handle it myself.""  
  
""Suit yourself.""  
  
He stood unsteadily and pulled something from his pocket, tossing it onto the coffee table with a clatter.  
  
My heart skipped. It was our engagement token—my mother's necklace, the one thing I had left of her.  
  
Back then, he gave me his mother's family heirloom diamond earrings—the ones I was wearing right now.  
  
""Take those earrings off,"" he said coldly. ""Our engagement is over.""  
  
I looked up at him. Those seductive eyes that once looked at me with desire were now as cold as ice.  
  
So that's what he meant by wanting to get married—just not to me.  
  
Five years together meant less than the thrill of a few stolen nights with someone new.  
  
I thought I'd fall apart. Break down crying.  
  
But not a single tear came.  
  
I simply removed the earrings and handed them back.  
  
Lawrence raised an eyebrow, slightly surprised by my composure.  
  
Still, he took them and walked away without a backward glance.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
News of my broken engagement with Lawrence spread like wildfire.  
  
The beating I expected from my father never came.  
  
Instead, my father cut off all contact with my siblings inEngland —his favorite punishment when he was pissed.  
  
He and my stepmother began hunting for a suitable replacement husband. They needed to marry me off to someone wealthy to maintain the Bennett family's social standing.  
  
But the rumors outside were getting nastier by the day.  
  
People whispered I'd done disgusting things to please Lawrence over the years. That I was ""used goods"" and probably couldn't even have children anymore.  
  
No decent man in New York would take me now.  
  
My father’s temper grew worse. And so did my life.  
  
Two months after our broken engagement, another bombshell dropped: Lawrence was getting engaged again—to Viola.  
  
He’d even gone against his parents for her.  
  
The gossip vultures made sure I heard every detail. I knew what they wanted—they were bored and missed having me around as their personal circus act.  
  
""Kristin, I think Lawrence still has feelings for you.""  
  
""Life's pretty rough now, huh? Why not beg him to take you back?""  
  
""He's actually a softie. Cry a little, maybe threaten suicide—he might change his mind.""  
  
""Viola's got nothing on you. You're way hotter.""  
  
I ignored them all and focused on preparing for marriage.  
  
A week ago, I spent an entire night on my knees begging until Dad finally agreed to let me take my barely-adult sister's place in an arranged marriage in Los Angeles.  
  
I was set to marry Asher Thorne, the eldest son of the Thorne family in Los Angeles. He has a reputation for ruthlessness.  
  
Everyone called him the uncrowned king of LA's elite. He's powerful but crippled in one leg with a volatile temper to match.  
  
But I'm not scared. Anything to escape the Bennett house and secure my siblings' freedom.  
  
Besides, New York has nothing left for me.  
  
In LA, maybe I’d find a way to survive.

I Finally Left, But I Don’t Recognize Myself Anymore. How Do I Find Myself Again? Is this narcissism??","25F, 27M – We were together for 1.5 years.
I cried almost every single day during that time — not even exaggerating. It was the most painful bond I’ve had with someone. And to this day, I still don’t fully understand if the problem was him, me, or both.

The relationship was so hard on me because even normal things would trigger fights. Once, I was part of a six-person grad school group, and one guy in the group — who happened to be married with two kids — my ex thought was “sleazy.” That alone almost led to a breakup. He didn’t talk to me for days, and I had to beg him to understand that it was strictly professional.

This kept happening — I’d get in trouble for things like:
- Staying out after 9 p.m.
- A friend posting dance videos on her story
- Me being extroverted
- Liking F1
- Not working out
- Not saying “thank you”
- Working in finance
- Talking about my coworkers
- Not offering to pay (even though I spent 10x what he did by the end)
- Wanting him to meet my parents
- Sleeping in
- Wanting to visit my friends
- Getting stuck in a snowstorm
- Not drinking coffee when he wanted me to
- Wanting breakfast
- Taking pictures of him — because he asked me to

The smallest things turned into huge fights, always starting with the silent treatment or irritation. And somewhere along the way, I changed so much to avoid conflict that I didn’t even know who I was anymore. I didn’t even understand what I was apologizing for half the time. I was emotionally exhausted. So eventually, I left.

After the breakup, we didn’t talk for 30 days. Then he reached out, and we ended up talking on the phone for 4.5 hours. He said he wanted to take accountability for how he showed up in the relationship, but also wanted me to do the same — except it wasn’t a straightforward conversation. It was clever, subtle, and steered toward “how do we fix this.” Luckily, we ended the call before making any decisions.

But two days later, he texted saying I seemed “distant” during the call and that he’s only willing to talk again if the effort is mutual. That made me angry. I told him I had nothing more to give and I was done. He called again trying to get me to reconsider, but this time I snapped. I said everything — everything I had bottled up for months. I didn’t hold back. We ended the call with me saying “no more.”

I did feel bad afterward for being so harsh, so I sent a short apology — but he never responded. I called the next day just to check in, and it was so awkward. A one-minute call, nothing more. I never reached out again.

On my birthday, he texted. The message didn’t even feel sincere — more like something written to sound right, but not actually be right. At the end, he wrote: “I’m open to talk if you feel the same.” I was confused. Who says that like it’s some business transaction? I haven’t responded. It’s been a week.

All that said, I am genuinely happy it’s over. I feel like I’ve been emotionally tortured for so long. And honestly, I blame myself for not leaving sooner. But I’m proud that I finally did. Still, I feel like I lost myself in that relationship. I don’t know what I like anymore. I don’t know what makes me happy. I feel numb.

I’ve been going out with friends every weekend, trying new things, spending time with family — but I still feel lost. How do I rebuild myself? How do I start feeling alive again?

- Sleeping in
- Wanting to visit my friends

- Taking pictures of him — because he asked me to

The smallest things turned into huge fights, always starting with the silent treatment or irritation. And somewhere along the way, I changed so much to avoid conflict that I didn’t even know who I was anymore. I didn’t even understand what I was apologizing for half the time. I was emotionally exhausted. So eventually, I left.

After the breakup, we didn’t talk for 30 days. Then he reached out, and we ended up talking on the phone for 4.5 hours. He said he wanted to take accountability for how he showed up in the relationship, but also wanted me to do the same — except it wasn’t a straightforward conversation. It was clever, subtle, and steered toward “how do we fix this.” Luckily, we ended the call before making any decisions.

But two days later, he texted saying I seemed “distant” during the call and that he’s only willing to talk again if the effort is mutual. That made me angry. I told him I had nothing more to give and I was done. He called again trying to get me to reconsider, but this time I snapped. I said everything — everything I had bottled up for months. I didn’t hold back. We ended the call with me saying “no more.”

I did feel bad afterward for being so harsh, so I sent a short apology — but he never responded. I called the next day just to check in, and it was so awkward. A one-minute call, nothing more. I never reached out again.

On my birthday, he texted. The message didn’t even feel sincere — more like something written to sound right, but not actually be right. At the end, he wrote: “I’m open to talk if you feel the same.” I was confused. Who says that like it’s some business transaction? I haven’t responded. It’s been a week.

All that said, I am genuinely happy it’s over. I feel like I’ve been emotionally tortured for so long. And honestly, I blame myself for not leaving sooner. But I’m proud that I finally did. Still, I feel like I lost myself in that relationship. I don’t know what I like anymore. I don’t know what makes me happy. I feel numb.

I cried almost every single day during that time — not even exaggerating. It was the most painful bond I’ve had with someone. And to this day, I still don’t fully understand if the problem was him, me, or both.

The relationship was so hard on me because even normal things would trigger fights. Once, I was part of a six-person grad school group, and one guy in the group — who happened to be married with two kids — my ex thought was “sleazy.” That alone almost led to a breakup. He didn’t talk to me for days, and I had to beg him to understand that it was strictly professional.

This kept happening — I’d get in trouble for things like:
- Staying out after 9 p.m.
- A friend posting dance videos on her story
- Me being extroverted
- Liking F1
- Not working out
- Not saying “thank you”
- Working in finance
- Talking about my coworkers
- Not offering to pay (even though I spent 10x what he did by the end)
- Wanting him to meet my parents
- Sleeping in
- Wanting to visit my friends
- Getting stuck in a snowstorm
- Not drinking coffee when he wanted me to
- Wanting breakfast
- Taking pictures of him — because he asked me to
