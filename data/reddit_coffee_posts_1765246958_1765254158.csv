i got a lot more likes than i expected, and one of them really stuck out to me. he's so dreamy looking, we have a lot in common, and he matched my banter perfectly. he asked me out on a coffee date and obviously i would love to go more than anything but i am so nervous. 

i don't know what to wear, what to do.. i can't even believe the thought that he finds me attractive because i've never experienced that kind of thing in person. i am just so clueless and lost and anxious. i know i'm overthinking it a bit but i'd love any sort of first date advice possible please",1,1765253771.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1phxzu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1phxzu9/another_mostly_unremarkable_surgery_and_recovery/,Another mostly unremarkable surgery and recovery,"First things first: everyone is going to heal differently! My story is not the same as anyone else’s and yours won’t be either. Also, my surgery was mostly elective/preventative. I didn’t have endo or adeno. I’m 38, never had kids, don’t want kids, with annoyingly inconsistent periods. I did have a polyp and it was my second one so doc said “we might have to do a polypectomy every couple years or we can just do a hysterectomy.” And she mentioned that by not having children I was at a higher risk of uterine cancer. 

I religiously followed and read posts on this subreddit to get ready for my surgery back in November. I made notes of things that came up for others to ask my doctor. I bought ALL THE THINGS. I was over prepared and I’m glad I was and I’m so thankful for this group that helped get me there. I’m pretty sure the biggest advice to take from this group is to start stool softeners a few days before! And continue until you feel ok to poo comfortably. And of course miralax (the mirafast chews were my preferred). Oh one thing I didn’t see but made up for myself was a caddy of easy snacks for middle of the night meds, all my surgery specific meds, colace, MiraLAX, gasX and gum and it just sat next to me in bed for about 5 days. I spent the first two weeks being pretty cautious because I have a friend who didn’t and had a lot of bleeding and set her recovery back. Also, as you’ll read my recovery has been pretty easy but it was all still very tender for at least the first 7 days. I was careful not to bend too much or use my abs when getting in and out of bed. 

Here’s my mostly unremarkable surgery: I went in on Wednesday, Nov 19 for a robotic assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy to remove my uterus, fallopian tubes and cervix (my ovaries are still hanging out). My biggest fear was the anesthesia because this was my first real surgery and I felt a moment of panic a nanosecond before I was out. I vaguely remember waking in the PACU and being in A LOT of pain deep inside. From this group and friends I had been prepared for incision discomfort and gas but didn’t know how it would feel to have my insides taken out. It took me about 2ish hours to be moved from PACU to a normal room with my husband. This began the waiting game of having to pee. I had water and chocolate pudding, tried once to no avail to go to the bathroom. Went back to my room to doze. Eventually asked again to be taken to the bathroom and after being in there for I don’t know how long, my nurse brought me a peri bottle of warm water and that helped me go. Unfortunately when I stood up, I puked in the sink and had forgotten that I had been eating pudding and mildly freaked out before I remembered. So they kept me for another couple hours. What we assumed would be 6 hours at the hospital ended up being almost 12. But at this point it’s mostly a blur. Got home safely and right into bed where my husband continued to wake me occasionally to take meds. 

1 DPO (gabapentin, Tylenol, ibuprofen 800, oxy)-got out of bed and noticed that the pain from last night was at a very mild 1 or 2. Made my own breakfast of oatmeal and even a cup of coffee for just a couple sips to avoid caffeine withdrawal. Spent most the day in bed using a foam recliner set from Amazon. 
2 DPO (gab, tyl, ibu 800)- zero need for oxy. Are we sure they did surgery? I feel pretty normal other than tired. A little nauseated but nothing that some gum and sprite can’t handle. First poop PO! I was scared but it was a breeze!
3 DPO (same)- first day out and about, my husband driving. Went to the hospital where my mom had a double lung transplant literally the week before my own surgery. She just couldn’t handle not being in the spotlight 😜. My husband pushed me in a wheelchair. I’m being as careful as possible. Pretty sure I made myself dinner this night. 
4 DPO (off all meds! Except colace and miralax, gasX)- this was actually my worst day. Not from pain but I was very nauseated and couldn’t eat. Cabin fever is setting in and that’s just with my body not feeling quite normal. No noticeable discomfort from incisions. Lots of gurgley gas moving and sounds. 
5-6 DPO- nothing remarkable. Eating normally. Showering and dressing myself without bending too much.  
7 DPO- was a little sneaky and went downstairs into the basement even though I was told not until day 10 but I felt so fine. Just took it easy and wanted a night on the couch with my husband to watch Ghosts and eat pizza. 
8 DPO- Thanksgiving. Felt great, spent time with family and again to the hospital, still using wheelchair. 
15-16 DPO- drove myself for the first time and ran some errands, went to the movies with a friend.

Going into 3 WPO- I’m getting back to daily stuff. I don’t work so that’s nice to not have to worry about that. Did my first grocery shop in a while but with my husband so he can lift the heavy 12 pack of la croix. Again sometimes I wonder if anything was done other than incisions because I’ve felt so fine. I read the surgical notes to be sure they actually did the damn thing. No serious pain after evening of surgery. I never got the gas in the shoulder pain. The gas felt like it got stuck around my ribs and I only felt it if I was laying flat. I stopped sleeping in a reclined position after day 7 and was back to sleeping on my side or even stomach by day 10. Occasionally I get little twinges of discomfort deep insidei. I’m assuming that’s normal. Also discomfort when my bladder gets too full but that’s not as bad as it was the first week or so after surgery. I stopped the miralax at around 14 DPO. Still using stool softeners when I remember and that’s more just in case things aren’t actually as good as they feel. 

Things I bought (or was given by a friend that had the same surgery this summer) and if I used them:
✨ hysterectomy pillow- no. I was told it was great to keep an ice pack in but I didn’t use my ice pack. 
✨seatbelt pillow- yes but only for the first week and I was only in the car a few times. 
✨ binder- I tried and hated it. Felt like it trapped my gas. My friend said she waited until after a week to use hers but I didn’t. 
✨heat pad- yes but this was more for my back from having to sleep in a weird position for myself. 
✨recliner kit- yes. Although I preferred a pillow under my knees instead of the wedge. 
✨grabber tool- yes. Although my water bottle was too heavy and I had to wake my husband up in the middle of the night to pick it up where I dropped it. 
✨bidet- had one long before this. Y’all just get one 😂
✨squatty potty- we have one because my husband had a hernia and needed surgery earlier this year but honestly this has never worked for either of us. 
✨over bed table with wheels- I’ve had this for awhile but found it useful to put my laptop on when spending so much time in bed. 
 
If you have any questions I’ll answer them the best I can! 

ETA- I walked slowly and regularly around my main floor every hour or so when awake to make sure things were moving. This was for the first 5 days or so.  ",3,1765253342.0,hysterectomy,0,1.0,False

[zerotrace.world](http://zerotrace.world/)

I’ve worked deep in computer vision and built platforms for years. Eventually I hit a wall with how extractive everything has become.

So, I repurposed something in our stack for exactly this.

No account required to create or join a session. No app. No install. No metadata. No tracking scripts. No middlemen. Just direct, ephemeral, encrypted P2P communication.

I don't like word walls either - as someone else mentioned here - but I feel compelled to let you know I loathe what it has all become. All of it. The enshittification of everything.

This started as an AR remote assist tool during COVID - built for my family. Then it became something more. A way to share video, audio, or files securely, right from the browser. Any device. Even a potato, as long as it has a browser.

You get a temporary link (QR can be used as well), it expires if unused in 5 minutes. Once the handshake completes, everything runs edge to edge. No logs, no retention. Just conversation.

Everything else wants to install something or need to flash. Everything else tracks something. This doesn’t.

It doesn't store contacts - it's a tunnel.

I’m not here to shill and far from a talking puppet. I’m just sick of the state of it all and wanted to give/help within our means.

Someone in another thread mentioned payment being a barrier. I get it. I had a longtime subscriber cancel a few years back. I called them. They said: “Milk and eggs are the priority right now.”

That stuck. Times are not what they were.

So, the classic “Buy us a coffee” button is there. That’s it. If someone throws some coin - great. If not - there are no tiered gatekeeping models in play.

I believe in relational value - not extractive.

We are looking at better ways to make anon payments - but really - it's not our focus right now.

Humanity is.

This isn’t breaking the bank for server costs - because there’s no central bandwidth drain. It just works.

I built this for the people who need it most. Marginalized voices. Private conversations. Vulnerable moments.

Also - full transparency - because I’m a dad, and I don’t want my kids growing up in a world where privacy is treated like a luxury - it's our most valuable thing - so it's important to us all. So done with this 1984 world.

Look - if you try it - thank you.

We will be refining the interface as it's still off my initial build from a few years ago.

In the next few weeks there will be a URL shortener that will further obfuscate what is being used.

Thanks for your time - and even if it's not this - just do what you can to keep a zero trace because that boot on the face sucks!!!

Oh - we will eventually release it to run stand alone as well in an offline mesh.",1,1765253191.0,u_AugmentedThinker,0,1.0,False
1phxx8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/yardsale/comments/1phxx8v/should_i_switch_from_nespresso_to_a_real_espresso/,Should I switch from Nespresso to a real espresso setup?,"People often ask if it’s worth switching from a Nespresso to a full espresso setup, and it hits me the same way I think about bedding: convenience versus experience. Nespresso is like a trusty, easy pillow—press a button, get something warm and comforting, and it’s consistent enough to feel satisfying every time. There’s no hassle, no fuss, just the comfort of predictability. For many, that’s exactly what they want.

But a true espresso machine is more like a high-end mattress or a hand-crafted pillow. The flavor, the aroma, the ritual of making it—it’s a whole different experience. You get control over grind, tamp, water temperature, pressure—all the little things that turn a drink from “good enough” to truly exceptional. It takes attention, patience, and practice, the same way sleeping on a new luxury mattress takes time to get used to and really appreciate.

Switching isn’t just about coffee—it’s about what you want from your daily ritual. If convenience and speed are king, Nespresso does the job beautifully. If you want craftsmanship, flavor depth, and a hands-on experience, a real espresso setup rewards that effort in a way capsules never will. Like bedding, the right choice depends on whether you want immediate comfort or a deeper, richer experience that takes a bit of work.",1,1765253122.0,yardsale,0,1.0,False

Excitement faded into disappointment when I realized its pretty dead. But then after reading the few posts that do exist, most are quite troubling. Which, to be fair is probably to be expected with this topic. 

So it's probably a good thing that people seemingly aren't very interested in this. 

Is this the point where I start telling my story? I'm not sure it's that interesting. If I'm being honest I have no idea why I'm making this post. I've never really met anyone who thought of sleep deprivation as exciting. 

Well then, here we go. I had years of my life in which I'd sleep 3-4 nights a week. Never stim fueled. Lots of coffee and cigarettes though and a bit of weed. I'm not sure what drove me to live like that but I thoroughly enjoyed that state of 'natural' highness. (Yeah, I was smoking weed but the high from sleep deprivation was much stronger than, and only amplified by the weed.) After some time I of course felt the tax that had on my mental.  I've just never been eager to get to bed as far as I can remember. But I made an effort to fix my sleep and I kinda achieved that. At least I'm sleeping 7/7 nights these days. 

This was all years ago and tbh I'm really missing the sleep deprived state. There used to be a point at which the world around me would stop existing and I'd be completely focused on whatever I'd be doing. 

I'd make ambient music tracks for myself to exist in, it was a very meditative state of being. 

I guess I'm just pondering about if one could do this in a healthy way. And I don't believe taking a bunch of minerals makes this healthy. Is there any proper research on this?

Things are pretty perfect other than the fact that I feel I’m the one that reciprocates more when it comes to time, effort, and money. I’m not unhappy by any means, but I do feel a little undervalued at times. 

She makes a little bit more money than I do and her parents still pay for her car insurance and phone, as well as paying for her college in full so she has no student loans. I pay student loans, car insurance, phone, etc. I’ve been having to work overtime shifts in order to be able to put money into savings, while she has over $60k sitting in the bank. 

An example of this is today I rode with her to our favorite coffee shop. She asked if I’d be getting a drink and I said I honestly cannot afford it right now because every cent I make is going to bills, savings, or Christmas presents. Instead of offering to buy me a drink she said “oh I’m sorry. Now I feel like an ass for getting one”. 

It is important to note that I am CONSTANTLY putting time, effort, and money into her. Just a couple weeks ago I drove to that same coffee shop to buy her a coffee which I surprised her with before work. I will spend my last $20 doing something to make her happy. Meanwhile, she will Venmo request me for a McDonald’s meal that I forgot to pay her for. 

I just feel like I’m putting in so much more and it really hurt me when she didn’t even offer to buy me a drink today. So am I overreacting? ",2,1765252948.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

I’d been kind of nerding out about getting a DeLonghi ECP/Stilosa and adding a dimmer, PID, gauge… just absolutely Frankensteining it. 

I found a marketplace post for (and secured) this “coffee machine” for $80. I’m pretty sure it was a steal, but validation dopamine is always nice. It’s dirty but seems to work fine. I’m going to use the stock basket(s) for a little bit, have a real tamper on the way, and plan on getting a bottomless portafilter in the not too distant future. That said, I spent a *ton* of time in the weeds with the DeLonghi and candidly just want to brew instead of doing a bunch of prelim research again. 

Is there anything I should know besides what’s in the manual wrt maintenance/cleaning or parts that tend to break? The pressure release after a shot sounds much louder than I expected but have no idea if it’s normal or not.

I lost 30 lb.. was it in the most healthiest way? Probably not 100% of the time which is exactly what I'm trying to figure it out. 

Today I had two coffees...
Two slices of meat pie with ketchup 
Some almonds 
A big bowl of spaghetti with cheese 
And a large handful of popcorn.

And two mini cupcakes which are about 100 calories each

I do not count my calories as someone who struggled with and eating disorder I find counting my calories can not be very great for my mental health 

Sometimes I struggle to know if what I'm eating is too much or too little I have about 25 more pounds to lose and I haven't been going as hard to the gym but I've been going and I haven't dropped a single pound. I'm starting to think it's because of what I eat 
But when I did lose a 30 lb, I wasn't eating exactly the greatest. The thing is I never restricted myself. So if I was craving those two slices of pizzas, I 100% will.. On a day-to-day basis my routine pretty much was a bowl of high protein yogurt, low sugar with some sort of fruit. Usually a full Apple cooked with honey cinnamon. Sometimes brown sugar but not often. I would pour that on top of my yogurt with half a cup of granola and sometimes with nuts and then I would have my supper.. throughout the day I would definitely have a coffee or two but that was it and I definitely would not sugar coat my bowl of supper.. but is that sustainable? I know it's not forever but is that not enough?.. I lost so much weight when I did this. Whike I know it might not be enough food.

My back is wrecked. I have an appointment to get things checked in the coming week but I do fear I have really damaged myself here. I tell mates I need more help and it gets joked off and I get told “ to rally”. I feel like I’m working in a work comp dream. I finally talked to a mate and told them that I’m seriously considering giving this order up because of the lack of help. During this time of year, wine sales alone hold 20% of store overall stores numbers. To expect 1 person to keep up with this level of heavy lifting is overwhelming. Because it’s not just the aisle (which is bigger than the average size)- it’s the side stacks, displays, and running to go get full cases. Everyday I feel I get nothing done but I know that I’m pushing as much as I can. I get told constantly things aren’t turning over fast enough by the mate over my section but they don’t help at all. The mate over my section has told me they can’t work as much wine because “I would be in pain if I did all of that”. So it’s basically falling onto me and just me. 

What’s worse is I have held back saying anything because I’m trying so hard to become more than what I am right now. I want to show I’m capable but I truly feel the odds are stacked against me. The past week I have fought back tears over pain and defeat more than I’d like to admit. I’ve stayed over my shift countless hours to have all odds and ends tied up. 

We are also VERY short staffed. We need to hire around 20-30 people. I’m aware there is no help no matter where I look but even the mate over my section isn’t pulling some of the weight. They schedule time for themself in the section, but do not work any product. Instead, they find another crew member to work it while they walk around with their coffee cup overseeing the work they are doing.

I wrote one of the produce orders before this and I truly don’t think anything will top that section. I loved it and still do but I know I need growth. I just wasn’t prepared to be in this level of pain every single day. I can’t even enjoy my off days anymore. My days off are dedicated to sitting on a heating pad. I love the challenge of learning new products, it’s the most exciting thing about this order. However, I feel I’m killing myself and I just don’t know if this is normal or if my store is lacking in getting help to a very heavy section. 

I need to know is this normal or am I being run ragged?? ",2,1765252253.0,tjcrew,3,1.0,False

As a solo dev building short-form content apps, I was frustrated until I stumbled on the Kling 2.6 API from Kie AI. It's a game-changer for AI video generation, especially if you're chasing that seamless text-to-video API workflow with built-in audio magic.

Let me break it down: Kling 2.6 isn't just another diffusion model – it's an audio-visual beast that generates full videos with synchronized speech, ambient sounds, and effects in one pass. No more Frankenstein-ing your outputs in Premiere or DaVinci. Whether you're prompting from text or uploading an image, it nails cinematic pacing, multi-character dialogue, even singing or ASMR vibes. Think product demos that pop, viral TikTok-style ads, or ambient shorts for your indie game trailers.

# Why Kling 2.6 API Stands Out in the Crowded AI Space

In 2025, with Stable Video and Runway eating up headlines, what makes **Kling AI** different? Native audio integration. Here's the quick spec rundown:

* **Inputs**: JSON-simple. Feed it a text prompt (e.g., ""A bustling cyberpunk market with vendors haggling in neon lights""), optional image URL (JPEG/PNG/WEBP, under 10MB), and tweak params like duration (5s or 10s), aspect ratio (square, widescreen, or vertical), and audio toggle.
* **Outputs**: HD videos with layered audio – speech that matches lip-sync, SFX tied to scene logic (rain patters during a storm prompt? Check), and ambient noise for immersion. Supports dialogue-heavy scenes or solo vocals.
* **Capabilities**:
   * **Text-to-video API** for zero-shot creation.
   * **Image-to-video** for animating statics.
   * Semantic audio: It ""understands"" context, so your elf singing in a forest gets ethereal echoes, not generic noise.
* **Pricing**: Super accessible – free credits to start, then affordable tiers (way cheaper than enterprise options). Unified billing if you're mixing with their other APIs like Kling 2.5 Turbo.

I tested it in their online Playground (no code needed – just browser-based prompts), and within minutes, I had a 10s clip of a coffee shop ad with barista banter and espresso hisses. Integrated it into my Python script via a single API call? Boom, automated content farm unlocked.

# Kling 2.6 API Real-World Use Cases for Creators and Devs

* **Indie Filmmakers**: Whip up dialogue-driven shorts without voice actors. Prompt: ""Two detectives arguing in a rainy alley"" → Instant noir with thunderclaps and gravel footsteps.
* **Marketers**: **AI video generator with synchronized speech** for product spots. Upload a logo image, add ""Energetic unboxing of a gadget with upbeat narration"" – done in seconds.
* **Game Devs**: Prototype ambient cinematics. It's like having a mini-Hollywood studio in your IDE.
* **ASMR/YouTube Hustlers**: Layered whispers and taps? Kling handles the subtlety better than most.

Pro tip: For devs, the API docs are clean – hit their endpoint with curl or requests library, parse the JSON response for your video URL. No steep learning curve, and it's scalable for batch jobs.

Love a good notebook, a good pen. Tactile, distraction-free, natural. Believe strongly in the brain-body connection that writing by hand activates for learning and recall. Enjoy the act of writing my lists and notes and especially daily journaling. Always have a notebook handy, or notecards in my suit pocket.  

At the same time, I love gadgets, always trying new things; and for years and years I've aimed at what could bring these strands together: Windows for Pen Computing (!), the first clunky keyboard Kindle up to the 2022 Scribe, any number and size of iPads (and various wasted dollars on different ""paper like"" screen protectors and styluses.) 

Tried a million different to-do or brain-map or task apps over the years, and just eventually built my own weird hybrid of BuJo - GTD - Covey - commonplace book that just...works...for me - but only really on paper, when each blank page can become what I need it to be in that moment.

Never really thought I'd find something that worked - and then I got this Move. As close to perfect as I've seen so far. Some quibbles, sure; but fundamentally, it's what I've always wanted, an easy, handy e-ink device that I can have close at hand, write pretty naturally, with enough rudimentary templates and file management to be sufficient - and to be a customizable infinite notebook that really can handle my mish mash system, all in one place.  And the size of it is so much more key to this than I ever thought. It's just so easy to have at hand, on the desk, on the nightstand, on my kitchen counter while I have coffee; throw it in my bag, or keep it by for notes while reading. 

Just super impressed.  So, the quibbles - but not dealbreakers:

\- battery life is a lie. Okay, but: I charge things every night. A good chunk of time I'm at my desk anyway. And the upside of a small battery is it gets to 100 again real fast.

\- could be easier to make pen/color switches; would love a marker with something like a smart button that could cycle through a couple presets

\- I do NOT want a full app ecosystem; but if you just gave me a some sort of locked down, limited Kindle app only, to save me from carrying one more device when I travel...

\- I do a fair amount of document review at work, so the landscape mode is the way to go for that, and it's not super ideal; but that's not my make or break use case here, and I really do believe the small size is the magic edge of this thing.

Keep in mind she was not under my care a couple years ago and only starting going to the vet when i began taking care of her.

I paid $229 for a coffee grinder that turned out to be a complete failure from day one.

It took over a month just to show up. My fiancé used it for barely a month before it broke due to a clogging issue — an issue I later learned is well-known and recurring with this model.

I reached out for help and was told I had to send it in for repair… but not before paying an extra $20 just to receive the shipping label. Unbelievable. I paid it because I just wanted the grinder to work.

I shipped it back using perfectly normal packaging. They “repaired” it and sent it back.

It lasted ONE WEEK.
One. Week.
Then the same clogging issue happened again.

At this point it was beyond obvious that this grinder has a design flaw, not a fluke.

When I emailed asking what was actually done during the repair and why it failed again, Luke Zhang — the representative handling my case — responded with dismissiveness and absolutely no meaningful help. His “solution”? That I should pay even more to “upgrade” to a more expensive model that “doesn’t have this clogging issue.”

That is a direct admission that the $229 model they sold me is prone to failure. So instead of addressing it, they upsell you. Disgusting.

I refused to give this company another cent and requested a refund. Luke agreed but only after deducting a 15% restocking fee, meaning I’d only get $194.65 back for a product that never functioned as advertised. I reluctantly accepted because I needed this trash off my counter.

Then comes the part that really proves what kind of operation this is:

They insist the grinder must be packed with excessive, hyper-precise padding — not for shipping protection, but because they reshelve and resell these defective units to other customers. It’s the only explanation that makes sense given their obsessive return requirements.

Fine. I packed it safely and sent it back.

Today I receive an email from Luke saying the grinder “broke in transit” — conveniently, the only time it has ever supposedly arrived damaged is the exact moment they owe me money. It made it to them perfectly fine for repair, but magically becomes “broken” when a refund is on the line. Sure. Very believable.

And the tone of Luke’s email?
Shockingly unprofessional, defensive, and outright hostile. No accountability, no apology, no help — just a refusal to honor the refund they previously agreed to, and a notice that they’re sending the broken grinder back to me.

Let me be extremely clear:
This is not customer service.
This is not quality control.
This is predatory business practice.

Their process is:
• Sell a grinder with a known clogging flaw
• Charge customers extra to “repair” it
• Return it unrepaired
• Push customers to pay for an upgrade to fix their defect
• Keep a restocking fee on returns
• Demand excessive packaging so they can resell malfunctioning units
• Claim “damage in transit” as a loophole to avoid issuing refunds
• Have representatives like Luke Zhang speak to customers with zero professionalism

I will be:
• Filing a BBB complaint
• Disputing the charge with my credit card
• Publicly warning every potential buyer

So when I see people planning things in big groups, I can’t help but feel jealous. And honestly, sometimes I don’t even want to reach out myself.

Though, as another point, unless I find a job here, I’ll be leaving in 6 months. That means most of the friendships I build here, apart from a couple of friends from the same country, probably won’t last long-term. So I’m a bit nervous…So, would it be better to keep pushing myself to reach out just to avoid spending this time alone, or would it be better to accept the loneliness or what I have as friends and try to make something out of it, and focus more on my studies?

I have 2 close friends here. I say hi to many people, but I rarely make plans with anyone at the moment because of schedules and my tiredness of always being the one to reach out. I’m not even sure if I’ll find people I truly vibe within my new class. I have certain personality traits that might come off a bit strong, I seem really independent in a way and have strong opinions. Though I’m empathetic and always ready to listen.

1phxagv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phxagv,LOTUS DROPS RECIPE,"Today’s session was a bit different.

Ever since I got my Lotus concentrates, I’ve been sticking to one specific recipe designed to highlight clarity and acidity, using only 2 out of the 4 bottles : calcium and potassium.
That recipe worked incredibly well for light roasts and washed coffees 👌🏻
But after trying it across more origins and processing methods, I realized it doesn’t always give the most delicious results.

So today, I decided to switch things up.
I picked a coffee I know very well one that tasted good with my old water recipe but I kept feeling something was missing. I really love a juicy mouthfeel, that full on juiciness that coats the entire palate. And since this coffee is naturally processed, its acidity is already lower, so I decided to try a new water recipe focused on boosting juiciness might bring out what I wanted.

Old recipe:

900ml distilled water
7 drops calcium
6 drops potassium

New recipe used in today’s test:

900ml distilled water
4 drops magnesium
4 drops calcium
2 drops sodium
2 drops potassium

(All variables identical only the water recipe was changed.)

The result? Shockingly good.
The coffee went from having weak juiciness to being completely mouthfilling and vibrant 😍❤️‍🔥
Even the aroma after brewing changed you immediately get this juicy, fruit forward smell. Easily this is the best cup of this coffee I’ve had 😍❤️‍🔥

Conclusion:
The fun part of mixing your own water is how you can tweak one single element and transform the entire cup without changing anything else. Lotus concentrates keep surprising me more and more… 😍❤️‍🔥

Currently doing my first rewatch of the show. Liked it the first time I watched it but loving it the second time around. Such a well-orchestrated show with great continuity, execution and acting. 

The characters are so well fleshed out in their flaws but, upon second watch, it seems a bit unrealistic for the girls to be so rude to service workers. Most of them were working service positions to some degree during that time (Hannah and Shosh at the coffee shop, Marnie at the club, Jessa at the children’s store). I feel like they’d have more empathy with service workers given their experiences. Also seems like millennials in general were known to be fairly kind to workers.

I know this sounds counterintuitive. It’s hard to find information regarding this. I’ve been on T for 3 and a half years now. I took a few months off a year and a half ago to freeze my eggs. I don’t know if it’s something else but being on T, I’ve had moments where I just feel this exhausting fog. No matter how much sleep I get I still feel tired. The only time I feel like I do have energy is at the gym but I have a couple injuries so I can’t always keep a consistent workout schedule.

I’ve been considering the idea of getting off of T to see if that will help. The prevailing thought is that T gives energy. But I’ve gotten off of Lexapro, coffee, quit the job I hate, gotten my blood work done and everything looks good so I’m at a loss for what to explain for the fatigue.

Most of the information I find regarding T and fatigue is that testosterone causes fatigue at first but that goes away once the body adapts to it. It’s hard to find information from people who have been on T for years (without the confirmation bias that T makes everything better) and especially for those who have gotten off T.

I’m open to getting off T because the binary goal I set for myself is turning out to be different than I expected. I’ll never be a cis-man and I am coming to terms with that. What I want most of all is to be healthy and productive.

TL;DR If it exists, I’d love to learn if anyone felt that getting off of T helped their energy levels.",2,1765250931.0,detrans,1,1.0,False

I’ve run Reddit campaigns for 4+ brands — from indie SaaS to hardware startups and the #1 lesson I keep relearning is:

**Reddit doesn’t reward marketers. It rewards** ***contributors***\*\*.\*\*

Here’s what *actually* works — based on data, bans avoided, and **real engagement.**

1. **Start by listening — for** ***weeks***\*\*.\*\*

Lurk in 3–5 relevant subs. Note:

* What questions get upvoted (not just commented on)
* What tone people use (sarcastic? technical? supportive?)
* **Your first 20+ posts should be** ***zero promotion***\*\*.\*\*  Answer questions. Share free templates. Post a genuine “here’s what failed for me” story. Build karma *and trust* — not just a number.

1. **When you do share something? Lead with value —** ***then*** **context.**

“We launched X — try it!”

“I kept forgetting client deadlines — so I built a free Notion template (no signup).

Here’s how it cut my follow-ups by 70% → \[link\]”

3.   **Engage** ***after*** **posting — for at least 48 hours.**

Reply to every comment (even “thanks”). Clarify. Ask follow-ups.

Reddit rewards sustained participation — not one-and-done posts.

**TL;DR: Treat Reddit like a neighborhood coffee shop — not a billboard.**

Show up, listen, help, *then* share — and only when it’s genuinely useful.

I need to be honest and I will probably be ridiculed for it, but the customers and the company are not why I’m leaving. It’s the partners that support toxic behavior from other partners. 
Over the years I have gotten so tired of hearing partners complain louder and louder about customers and partners on the floor, in front of regulars, or customers coming in for the first time. Partners will wait until someone clocks out and leaves then start talking so poorly about them. God forbid a partner is rude to a customer and I defend the customer, any time I have done it on here I get so many downvotes I’m surprised I’m still allowed to post here.
I love the job, I love some of my coworkers, and I will miss my community, but the overall self entitled attitude of the majority of partners has soured my view of the entire industry.

This story is about a closeted gay man coming to terms with his past, an asexual Christian man learning how to love, and the barrier that has seperated the two from understanding eachother crumbling under the weight of comfort in brotherhood. 

He never minded walking alone, but each step felt colder than the last. A drop hit his arm, but he pretended not to notice. The only thing that mattered was the sweet scent in the air, the sound of laughter, and the warmth he’d been searching for. 

The empty sidewalk stretched ahead of him, and the sound of leaves under each step broke the silence of the afternoon. The smell of burning oak filled the air, as chimney smoke scattered the evening light spilling over the hills. Thoughts filled his head about his performance at work, and as he rounded the corner were quickly drowned by the allure of the cafe. Droplets grew heavier as the storm broke behind him.

He ran to the awning of the cafe, sighing as he finally found a place to escape the onslaught of autumn. He peered through the glass door before entering, taken aback by the unusually large crowd for a Friday afternoon. 

Angel sat at the bar tracing the rim of his mug. The stool to the left of him had a short leg. He noticed this the first time he came here and made a point to avoid that stool, instead sitting directly beside it. He didn’t like people. It was nothing about people themselves, it was just human nature. 

The world was full of bad actors. They’d put on a fake smile, pretend to laugh sincerely, or act nice as though if they acted the right way, they would be rewarded for their lies. To be fair, he did it too. He was just better at it than most people. So, he sat next to the stool most people would be bothered by.

He watched as the barista approached a man with a mug of coffee, a single drip fell down the side of the mug. He noticed the man, glancing at his phone with a nervous look. *No doubt his wife thinks he’s at work.*

The pain in his stomach faded since he’d been here. Coffee certainly helped. He stared into his cup swishing the coffee around, a hint of a smile crossing his face as it began to rain outside. 

When he heard the door, he glanced up, stunned by the presence of the guy in the doorway. The noises of the cafe faded as he caught himself staring at Koda. He looked away as soon as he realized and turned back to his mocha.

Koda walked up to the bar, sitting on the stool beside Angel. Angel couldn’t help but look again. His broken stool trap failed, but he wasn’t certain it was a bad thing. The warmth Koda had just with his presence was abnormal. 

He’d felt it before, but couldn’t recall what the feeling was. Koda glanced at him as Angel pulled out his phone to distract himself. The barista walked up and Koda turned his focus back to coffee, asking for a mocha. As the barista left, Koda turned back to Angel.

“Lovely weather, huh?” he asked. He nodded toward the window, with a smile that carried through his eyes. 

“Uh. Y-yea. The weather is–uh–the rain. It’s nice,” Angel struggled to reply. 

*His smile seems so real.*

“Do you, um… come here often?” 

“Mm, occasionally. This place just happened to be my saving grace from the rain. I was actually on my way home,” Koda replied, rocking back and forth on the stool’s broken leg.

“Ah, that makes sense,” Angel said, noticing his collected appearance despite his damp sweater. *This guy. Not a hint of discomfort on a broken stool in wet clothes.*

He turned back to his coffee, swirling the drink in the mug. He closed his eyes, breathing in the sweet smell, then opened them again, looking back at Koda.

“What cologne are you wearing?”

“Oh, it’s frankincense. It’s actually just something I usually burn to soothe my nerves.”

Angel looked towards the ceiling, watching the fan spin slowly, trying to remember where he’d heard the word before. *Frankincense.*

I know this sounds counterintuitive. It’s hard to find information regarding this. I’ve been on T for 3 and a half years now. I took a few months off a year and a half ago to freeze my eggs. I don’t know if it’s something else but being on T, I’ve had moments where I just feel this exhausting fog. No matter how much sleep I get I still feel tired. The only time I feel like I do have energy is at the gym but I have a couple injuries so I can’t always keep a consistent workout schedule. 

I’ve been considering the idea of getting off of T to see if that will help. The prevailing thought is that T gives energy. But I’ve gotten off of Lexapro, coffee, quit the job I hate, gotten my blood work done and everything looks good so I’m at a loss for what to explain for the fatigue. 

Most of the information I find regarding T and fatigue is that testosterone causes fatigue at first but that goes away once the body adapts to it. It’s hard to find information from people who have been on T for years (without the confirmation bias that T makes everything better) and especially for those who have gotten off T. 

I’m open to getting off T because the binary goal I set for myself is turning out to be different than I expected. I’ll never be a cis-man and I am coming to terms with that. What I want most of all is to be healthy and productive.

TL;DR If it exists, I’d love to learn if anyone felt that getting off of T helped their energy levels.",2,1765249940.0,actual_detrans,1,1.0,False

Interview With The Sandman
(A reimagining of Jeff The Killer by Sessuer‘s and GameFuelTv’s)

	He tapped his hand in a rhythmic pattern. The same two taps, then a pause. Three, pause, then two again. He sat, cuffs pinning him to the table, face covered in sparse strands of long dark hair. A line of drool had been flowing from his obscured mouth, collecting on the cold metal, before unceremoniously dripping onto the floor. He breathed slowly, wheezing, like he had smoked since birth. In, hollow. Out, raspy. 

	Detective Simmons stood on the other side of a one-way mirror, watching him. Taking one hand to rub his eyes, he sighed deeply,  then trailed his fingers down to smooth out his mustache. He was a portly man in his 40s, ginger hair covered by a brimmed police hat, tired eyes that never seemed to blink. He stood, slouching slightly, before jumping at the sound of the door opening. 

	“Oh shi-, sorry sir!” Andy yelled into the room as he entered, “I brought the coffee.”

	Andy was a younger man, with a heavily freckled face, framed by curly brown hair that fell on either side of his face. 

	“Jus- just put it on the table, Richards.” Simmons wearily replied, before returning his gaze to the glass. Gingerly, Andy set the cheap disposable cups on the table behind Simmons. He went to stand beside Simmons, his unprofessional hoodie swaying as he turned, as his badge haphazardly hung from his belt.

	For a moment he stood in silence, staring along with Simmons. The silence almost seemed loud, like the air itself whispered underneath each exhale.They stood, watching the man behind the glass, before Andy broke the stillness, coughing aloud.

	“So, who’s he?”

	Simmons didn’t take his eyes off the glass, “He’s an old case - Jeffery Woods. About 20 years back he committed triple homicide on his family, burned their house down, and then three more killed after that.”
	
	Andy broke his gaze to look at Simmons. “So why’s he here then? Isn’t the case solved? Day saved and all that?”

“It might not be,” Simmons replied, “there’s been a new string of murders, all the same M.O.; throat sliced open, with the mouth carved as well.” He rubbed his eye again, still seemingly never having blinked.

“So, a copycat killer?”

“Nah, can’t be,” Simmons sighed. 

“What do you mean?”

“Can’t be, the deaths are too similar. Some of the details that weren't released have been mimicked.” Simmons broke his gaze from the glass for a moment, looking at Andy,  “The witnesses also give a description that’s the same as our guy here.”

“Y’know,” Andy started, laughing under his breath, “seeing him now, he doesn’t look as scary as I thought. Kids used to tell plenty of stories about him.”

“Ugh,” Simmons grunted, turning his head back, “not the sorta thing a kid should be hearin’ about.”

“Well some have tvs playing while parents don’t pay attention,” Andy began, a hint of excitement in his voice. “They hear the news of some killer, and are fascinated with it. Before you know it they’re sharing with other kids, who also share it, and boom - new neighborhood boogeyman.”

“Personal experience, Richards?”  Simmons mumbled, barely trying to be heard.

“Heh, you could say that. We called him ‘Jeff The Killer’. Dumb name looking back on it.” 

As Andy finished, Simmons turned to the table, grabbing his coffee.

“We’re gonna keep this simple, by the books. Don’t let on that someone’s out there killing people. Less he knows, less he’ll hide. Got that?”

Andy raised his hand in a mock salute. “Aye aye o’ captain my captain.”

Simmons grumbled, shaking his head as he reached for his radio.

“Cooper, this is Simmons. We’re ready to begin.”

*
Andy and Simmons sat opposite of him. He didn’t acknowledge their entrance, and just kept tapping on the table. Closer up you could see his breath push his hair forward slightly. He had brought it forward, trying to cover all of his face, though it made the rest of his balding head more obvious. His chest heaved, every breath a focused effort. 

Simmons was the first to speak. 

“Jeffery Woods, I’m detective Simmons, and this is officer Richards.” He spoke clearly, calmly. Like a parent speaking to a young child, not wanting to startle or upset them. 

He continued, ”We just want to ask you a few questions, can you do that?” 
	
All at once, Jeff stopped tapping. His breathing was silent, as he sat up in his chair. His hair fell to either side of his face, like curtains revealing a stage. Rather than a fantastical set piece, a pale, burned face was unveiled. 

He was disgusting, there was no way around it. His skin was pale, almost white, with healed burns framing parts of his face. His mouth was filled with stained yellow teeth, crooked with rotten gums, all clearly visible from his cut mouth and shriveled lips. His slashed mouth was stitched, though many of them had torn and hung loose from the scars. His right eye was a pale brown, the other was long blinded, cocked far to the left. He had no nose, it was long gone. In its place were just two small holes he wheezily breathed from.  He smiled, always. It was hard to tell if it was just his carved face or if he consciously grinned at all times; maybe it was both. 

“I remember you,” he spoke. His voice was gravelly, raspy, like sandpaper across your ears. 

“Yes, I interviewed you a long time ago now,” Simmons said, “we just want to ask you a few questions.”

Jeff cocked his head to the side, staring into Andy. He jumped once his eyes fell on him, and Jeff said, “You’re new… different.”

“Uh, ye- yeah,” Andy replied, almost shaking, “I’m, I'm new.”

Jeff stared for a moment, before turning his head back to Simmons, his neck audibly cracking. His eyes widened, mouth stretching, as he spoke.

“Ask away, Gerald.”

“Please Jeff,” Simmons sighed, looking down at the table for a moment, “Just call me Simmons.”

Jeff just continued to stare at him for a moment, his eye ever so slightly twitching. Simmons looked up, before opening a manilla folder previously under his arm. 

“You remember your mother, right Jeff?”

“Oh yes, I remember,” he began, his voice creaky, almost cooing. “She was just a doll. Kind, calm, but stern. Always worried about her boys, but never enough to do anything for them.”

He gestured at his face, or, at least he tried to with his restricted hands. 

“I still remember when she first saw… this. She was so scared, a great wailing mess.”

“Alright,” Simmons quietly continued, glancing at Andy, who nervously brought his hands away from the table, placing him in his lap. 

“What do you remember about your father?”

Jeff straightened his back as he heard this, 

“Ah, cranky old man. Don’t ever remember seeing him smile. Just always tired from his job, too tired for any of us.”

“Did he ever strike you, as punishment?” 

“No, that would require giving a single damn about his kids. That's something he couldn’t try to muster up.” 

	“Is that why you killed him?” Andy blurted suddenly. Both Simmons and Jeff turned over to look at him, both surprised by him speaking. 

	Jeff chuckled, a sound like a broken exhaust pipe. 

	“You… you’re catching on, rookie. Good head on those shoulders.” He looked into Andy’s eyes, rising in his chair. “Make sure you don’t lose it.”

“Back to your family, Jeff.” Simmons loudly spoke. Jeff looked back to Simmons, and returned to his seat. 

“Yeah, Dad was so unhappy, all the damn time. Up until I made him smile, and smile, and then,” he made the motion of his hand falling down. 

Simmons flipped a page in the manilla folder, tracing his finger as he read. Andy held his hand, coiled in a fist, up to his mouth. Simmons looked up and spoke again.

“You had a brother, right?”

Jeff’s eye widened, “Oh yes. He was such a good guy. Real defensive, always keeping kids off my back. Too bad, too bad he’s gone.”

“He defended you, yet you killed him?”

“Nah nah nah, don’t get it twisted,” Jeff replied, shaking his head. “What happened, he did to himself. Now he’s happy, just like me.” 

“Why, what did he do?” Andy asked, drawn in. Jeff glanced at him for a moment, then just went quiet.

Simmons shot a look at Andy, before loudly clearing his throat.

“Your family was found dead in your home, which had been set on fire,” He began. “We just want to know why.”

 Simmons and Andy waited intently, looking for any changes in Jeff's mood. 

Jeff tilted his head slightly, grunting quietly.

 “They didn’t want to share in the joy.”

“What is ‘the joy’?”

“This,” Jeff pointed at himself, “Is the joy. I;m filled with it. A face like mine knows nothing but smiles, and you can’t help but try and share in the excitement!” 

Andy’s face scrunched up in disgust, like he’d eaten a sour fruit. Simmons simply sat back in his chair, continuing to look through the file.

“I mean, most people refuse, and that’s when I,” Jeff made the motion of slicing his throat, “And then, they go to sleep. I give them a smile, and they’re happy, forever.” 

Andy pounded his fist on the table, shouting into Jeff’s face,

“So that’s your excuse? You killed three of your family because they wouldn’t be ‘happy’ like you?!”

“Richards!” Simmons yelled, standing up from his chair. Jeff began laughing, hysterically. He almost fell back in his chair, but the cuffs kept him leaning forward. 

“Hah aha haha, three? Ahahahahahaaaaa!”

“Now, calm down Jeff,” Simmons started, sitting back in his seat. His voice had become a smooth, calming tone, “I promise Richards will not be upsetting you again.”

He shot a fiery look at Andy, like he was trying to turn him to stone. Andy slumped back in his chair, ashamed.

“Now then,” Simmons continued, “can you tell me about the others you… put to sleep.”

Jeff began settling back in his chair, stopping his manic giggles. 

“Hah, oh yes. Troy, Keith, and Randy. We weren’t on the best terms, different clicks, high school bull, you get the idea. ”

Simmons sat forward slightly, “No, you didn’t.”

“Well it was at a bus stop, and they were acting all tough, giving us dirty looks. We tried told em to fuck off, but they starting getting in our faces. So we fought em’, and we got in trouble for it!”

“Your brother fought them as well, right?” 

Jeff’s ever present grin widened, “Oh of course, but even both of us couldn’t beat all three of them. At least, not until later…”

“What do you-” Simmons was cut off by knocking at the door. He jumped slightly in his chair, before going up to open it.

“I’ll be right back, don’t talk to him until I get back, okay Richards?”

Andy quietly nodded, “Ye-, yes sir.”

Simmons nodded, walking out of the room. Andy sat silently, looking down at the table, trying everything not to stare. Jeff breathed heavily, almost like a happy dog. He stared at Andy, trying to get even a moment of accidental eye contact. Andy tried with all his power to not look back, knowing Jeff's eyes were on him, burning a hole in his head. For just a moment, he broke, and looked back.

Seeing his opportunity, Jeff began, “You’re a detective, right Andy?”

Andy wanted to ignore him, but saw himself answering him. 

“Uh, no. Just an officer.”

“But you wanna be one, right? That’s why Gerald’s bringing you around.” 

Andy shrugged, looking up at Jeff. “I mean, yeah.”

“So tell me this,” Jeff continued, “I have been in here for 20 years, yet someone is out there looking and acting like me.”

“How do you-” Andy attempted, before being cut off.

“But how could that be? Well, let me ask you this, what happens to someone’s fingerprints when they’re burned?”

Andy stood up, backing away from the table as Jeff continued.

“Now, who could look the most like me, who isn’t me?” Jeff continued, staring down Andy while speaking. “Or,,, who could I look like most?” 

Andy had fully backed up to the mirror, his chest heaving in panicked breaths. His mouth was open, gasping for any air. He kept his eyes on… whoever sat at the table before him. Suddenly, he nearly jumped as someone knocked at the door again. He gasped for a moment, leaning over, holding himself up by grasping his knees. His breath returning to him, he walked to the door.

As he opened the door, he saw Simmons standing on the other side. He grinned and opened his mouth to speak, but lost all words as Simmons slumped forward. Andy stepped back, gazing at the knife planted deep in Simmons’s back, before looking up to his killer.

There, standing tall above him, was the face of the real Sandman. Black greasy hair draped down to his shoulders, tangled and unkept. Burns dominated his face, scarred over muscles twisted and warped almost inhumanly, dotted with wisps of scraggly facial hair. A wide, torn smile filled with yellowed teeth. A mere hole for a nose, below two bloodshot eyes, crazed and filled with fire. He wore a dirty and bloodied sweatshirt over his muscled body, above tattered and stained pants and boots.

Andy stumbled back, his breath hitching in his lungs from the sight of Jeff. 

“Time to play Liu,” the killer growled from under his breath. 

With a snap, Andy felt his air ripped from him, as Liu brought the chain of his cuffs to his throat. 

“Shhh,” he hummed, free from his bindings. 

Liu wrestled Andy to the ground, as Jeff took the knife from Simmons’s back.He tried clutching at the chain cutting off his air, but Liu’s strength was too much. He gasped desperately for air, trying with everything he had to fight back, wildly kicking and thrashing. But it was no use.

As the life left his lungs, the last thing Andy saw was the real Jeffery Woods bring a knife to his mouth. The man once cuffed to the table was never the Woods Killer, just his brother, a 20 year decoy. He felt the knife pierce his flesh, slitting open his mouth, as the real Jeff whispered.

I am 22F currently in a masters program with a guy, 23M that I am interested in and I am thinking of asking him out and need some advice. I do not know him well, but I have had a few conversations with him (we’ve only been in our program for 3 months) mostly about undergrad research, and future career plans, but enough to realize he is attractive, driven, and super smart. He comes off as a little bit shy and I am not particularly good at flirting so it has been hard to talk to him in class especially because we do not sit near each other at all. I am not very good at having crushes so I kind of want it to be over (either reciprocated or rejected) so I am thinking of asking him out. I have never asked out a guy before, and I’m not sure if I should or how I should go about it. I’ve seen some guys find it desperate or masculine for women to ask them out and other times guys say they love when girls have the confidence to tell them they are interested so I am really not sure what to do. We are coming up on the 3 week winter break and I am considering dming him on insta about halfway through break and saying something like:

“Hey! I think you are cute and super interesting and I’d love to get to know you better! Let me know if you’d ever be interested in getting coffee or a drink sometime when we are back in town!”

I only am thinking about doing it during break because we are in a pretty small cohort (about 25 people) and I have every single class with him so I think I need a little bit of time after if he rejects me before I can see him again to recover from the embarrassment. I know it’s totally normal to ask people out but I have never done it before and I am usually much more reserved when it comes to guys I like but I’ve realized nothing I’ve done in the past (like trying to subtly flirt) has worked for me so might as well be more direct. Any advice y’all have would be really appreciated it! I’m really out of my comfort zone with this one!

Basically it's the variation in time between your heartbeats, and it tells you a lot about how your body handles stress.

Higher HRV = your body can switch between ""go mode"" and ""chill mode"" pretty easily. Lower HRV = you're stuck in fight-or-flight and your system isn't bouncing back well. That explained a lot for me.

What's actually been helping:

* Slow breathing exercises. Like 4 seconds in, 4 seconds out. Sounds too simple but it genuinely shifts something.
* Moving more, but not killing myself. Walking, some yoga, nothing crazy intense.
* Getting serious about sleep. 8 hours with an actual consistent schedule made a noticeable difference.
* Cutting back on caffeine. This one hurt but I was basically running on cortisol and coffee.
* Eating better - more whole foods, less garbage.

I got a smartwatch that tracks HRV and it's been eye-opening to see how certain days or habits tank my numbers. There's also something called HRV biofeedback training where you can actually learn to regulate this stuff in real time.

I use a V60 exclusively, with a ZP6 Special grinder with a Fellow Stagg temperature-controlled kettle & Fellow scales so I'm fairly deep down the rabbit hole.

The #1 online Australian roaster I've found is Offshoot Coffee in WA, but I'm in Victoria and enjoy buying coffee in person where I can smell the beans through the escape valve in the bag before deciding. Proud Mary is my favourite Victorian roaster thus far but they can be expensive, Constant Coffee in Geelong would be second on my list (but I wish they roasted lighter) and I'd love to find others. 

I gravitate towards Columbian & Ethiopian beans and usually prefer Natural processed over Washed. I really love Gesha but have a hard time justifying the enormous price premium most of the time. Similarly many beans that use more exotic processes can be satisfyingly funky but feel like more of a risk ordering online when you aren't sure if paying 2-4x as much is going to be worth it.

1phwkvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1phwkvq/managing_finances_30m_38f/,Managing finances [30M 38F],"Hi everyone. I (30M) would appreciate some opinions on my family dynamics. First, some background info. I spent nearly my whole life in school, have 2 master's degrees and a PhD in highly competitive fields (as in hard to get admitted and to succeed as a student fields). I have now finally graduated and landed a very well-paid job.

I met my wife (38F) 8 years ago during my master's studies who worked as an event organizer at a research institute nearby. My PhD studies took me far away and we were long distance for a while, she then joined me in my last year, we got married and were blessed with a child. Her move was made possible by her position switching to remote mode but with the fund cuts from the current US administration the institute looked for ways to save money and she was offered a buyout (a large lump sum payment in exchange for her resignation) that she took.

We have been 50-50 on all expenses from day 1 of our relationship but now as her lump sum is running out the relationship is getting strained. Even though we are 50-50, I have been paying nearly all baby-related expenses including clothing, toys and daycare as well as family insurance and other extras. I had no income over the summer and in September (lag in pay) and happily burned through my savings in the gap between graduation and employment without saying a word. I have very little retirement savings as I have been a student my whole life and as I was hired later in the year I had only a few months to maximize my tax advantaged retirement contributions for 2025 leaving me peanuts after tax/deductions, so I continued using my savings as needed (to a much lesser extent than in the summer, obviously this will be different in 2026 as contributions will be spread out). Since my spouse has been in the work force for much longer (and is older than me), she has amassed a significant amount in retirement and non-retirement savings. Now as my spouse's lump sum is nearly gone, she will have to tap into her (non-retirement) savings (which she has much more than me) until she finds a job and is freaking out expecting me to fully cover all expenses until then.

Why am I allowed to burn through my savings but she is not? What is her incentive to find a job sooner rather than later in this case? The baby is in daycare (that I pay for) and she has had all the time to herself (part of which she admittedly would spend recovering from sleepless nights from the baby) and wants to continue doing so without contributing financially until a job is found. Heck I would love to stay home and be provided for as well. 

Her other arguments for me paying even more (if not everything) are (1) she sacrificed her career for me (while in reality she decided to take that buyout herself, her career was already a dead end with virtually no growth for years, thanks to me we moved to a much better location with better opportunities and the baby is her child too - not a gift for me); (2) she spends more time with baby at night (which is true, but this is solvable especially as the baby is getting older and it's already getting better), but again I am paying for daycare, so figuratively speaking in terms of contributions, I am spending all the time with him during the day; (3) she has fatigue from her thyroid issues (but the disease is fairly well understood, treatable and manageable; I myself have an autoimmune disease that has no cure, medical understanding or fully effective treatment that can disable me at any time which makes retirement contributions now particularly important and I constantly fight fatigue with loads of coffee that inevitably triggers horrible migraines with aura at least once a month). Obviously, her sister is on her side (who, by the way, married into wealth, has 2 kids and still works part time), but now she, for some reason, contacted my mom for advice which I find particularly weird/uncomfortable.

1phwil6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1phwil6/how_to_be_extremely_confident_even_if_youre_quiet/,How to be extremely confident even if you're quiet (what 10 years of studying people taught me),"Then I spent a decade watching how the most respected people in rooms actually behave. The pattern I found changed everything: the quietest person often held the most power.

Real confidence isn't loud. It's calm, controlled, and magnetic in a way most people can't explain.

Here's what I learned:

1. Silence is your superpower, not your weakness

Most people panic when conversation stops. They rush to fill every gap with words, jokes, anything to avoid awkwardness.

Let it breathe.

When someone asks you a question, pause for two seconds before responding. Sounds simple but it does something powerful it shows you're thinking, not performing. People unconsciously read this as high status.

I watched this happen in a meeting last week. Guy got asked a tough question. Counted to two. Then answered calmly. Everyone leaned in. The person who immediately word-vomited right after was forgotten in seconds.

2. Your body language talks louder than your mouth

Quiet confident people move differently. They're slower. More deliberate.

Next time you reach for your coffee, move 20% slower than your impulse tells you. When you walk somewhere, reduce your pace slightly. Rushed movement screams anxiety. Unhurried movement whispers control when you slow down physically, your nervous system actually calms down. Your body language doesn't just communicate to others. It communicates to you.

Stand like you own your space. Feet shoulder-width. Shoulders back but relaxed. Not aggressive, just grounded. Take up the room you're entitled to without apology.

3. Say less, mean more

I used to think I needed to contribute to every conversation to be valued. Wrong. Quiet confident people are selective. They speak when it adds value, not just to be heard.

Before you talk, ask yourself: Does this need to be said? Does it need to be said by me? Does it need to be said now?

When you DO speak, cut the fluff:

* ""Let's try a different approach"" beats ""Um, I was kind of thinking maybe we could try something else?""
* ""I disagree"" beats ""I don't know, I guess I see it differently, but maybe I'm wrong""

People remember the person who said three meaningful things, not the person who said thirty forgettable ones.

4. Master the strategic pause

This changed everything for me. When you finish making a point, stop talking. Don't explain further. Don't soften it. Just let it land.

Most people get uncomfortable and keep talking, which dilutes their message. You staying quiet after making your point is confidence. Silence makes people think about what you said instead of waiting for you to finish so they can talk.

5. React less than everyone else

Quiet confident people consistently under-react compared to the room. Someone tells a funny story and everyone's laughing loud? You smile genuinely but don't perform it. Someone shares exciting news and people are gasping? You say ""That's great"" with controlled enthusiasm.

Plus when you DO show big emotion, it carries weight because it's rare. Your excitement becomes valuable because you don't give it to everything.

6. Have strong opinions you state calmly

This is what separates quiet confidence from just being shy. Shy people avoid stating opinions because they fear judgment. Quiet confident people have clear views they're willing to share without aggression.

You can say ""I completely disagree with that approach"" in a measured, calm tone. The delivery makes the strong stance even more powerful. You're not trying to convince anyone or win an argument. You're just stating your truth.

I've watched this play out hundreds of times people respect clear positions even when they disagree. Wishy-washy stances get dismissed immediately.

7. Control your attention like it's currency

Your attention is valuable. Treat it that way.

When someone's talking to you, turn your full body toward them. Don't let your eyes scan the room. Don't check your phone. Be fully present for those two minutes.

People will remember you as one of the best conversationalists they've met. Not because you said anything profound, but because you actually listened. Almost nobody does this anymore.

also know when to withdraw attention. If a conversation isn't valuable or someone's being disrespectful, politely exit. Your time has boundaries. That's self-respect, and people can feel it.

8. Don't overshare - create layers

Most people anxiety-dump their entire life story trying to create connection. Quiet confident people reveal information slowly.

Surface level stuff first - where you're from, what you do. Then interests and perspectives as rapport builds. Deep vulnerabilities and dreams? Only with people who've earned it.

Scarcity creates value. When you don't give everything away in the first conversation, people become more curious about you. Mystery is magnetic.

9. Stay calm when people try to rattle you

Someone insults you? ""Interesting take"" with a slight smile. Someone tries to one-up you? ""Good for you"" with genuine neutrality. Someone baits you into arguing? ""I see it differently"" and move on.

Reactive people give their power away. When you can't be baited, you can't be controlled.

This is genuine calm that comes from being secure enough that other people's opinions don't shake you.

10. Build real competence in private

Here's the truth nobody wants to hear: You can't fake deep confidence.

But you CAN build it by getting genuinely good at things when nobody's watching. Every skill you master in private adds to your foundation.

Lift weights until you're objectively strong. Learn something until you're objectively competent. Build something until it objectively works.

Confidence is just self-trust. Self-trust comes from evidence. Evidence comes from doing hard things and succeeding. Stack enough of that, and you walk into any room with unshakeable calm.

What this looks like in practice:

You walk into a room. You move deliberately. You observe before jumping in. Your phone stays in your pocket. When someone speaks to you, you give them your full attention. When you speak, every word counts. When there's silence, you're comfortable in it.

People can't explain why they're drawn to you. They just are.

Quiet confidence isn't about being invisible. It's about being so secure you don't need constant validation.

1phwdhw,https://i.redd.it/wcy90hvfe36g1.jpeg,"3-Month Minoxidil Update: My Honest Results, Routine, and What I’ve Learned","Hi everyone! I’m back with my three-month minoxidil update. I previously shared my two-month results and promised I’d continue posting, because reading other people’s updates was genuinely one of the few things that gave me hope during the darkest part of my hair-loss journey. If my experience can give even one person that same hope, then sharing is absolutely worth it.

All progress photos above are real, correctly dated, and taken with freshly washed, blow-dried hair. I’m not selling anything, I’m not promoting any specific product, and I’m not trying to gain anything from this post. I just want to share what has helped me, while acknowledging that everyone’s diagnosis and response to treatment will differ.

My strongest recommendation: see a dermatologist who specializes in hair loss, get the appropriate bloodwork, and consider a scalp biopsy so you actually know what you’re treating. I’m not a doctor, everything here is simply what I’ve learned from my own experience and countless hours of research.

About Me & My Diagnosis:

I’m a 31-year-old female. I was first diagnosed with androgenic alopecia (AGA) at age 25, but it wasn’t noticeable then, so I didn’t treat it. My hair has always been fine and thin, but in May 2025, I began experiencing rapid hair loss.

That loss ultimately led to a diagnosis of lupus, and I was told I was also dealing with telogen effluvium (TE) triggered by the autoimmune flare. Hair loss was actually my first symptom of lupus.

Here’s the timeline of my treatment:
	•	August 2025: Started spironolactone to block DHT for AGA
	•	September 2025: Began hydroxychloroquine and low-dose prednisone (5 mg) for lupus
	•	This week: Fully discontinued prednisone
	•	September 8, 2025: Started 5% topical minoxidil

At the end of this post, I will post what I’m currently doing. I’ve adjusted this routine many times, but this version seems to be giving me the best results so far. I’m extremely happy with my progress, honestly, I never thought I would regrow hair this quickly, or at all. Most people say minoxidil results take six months or more, so getting visible improvement at three months feels like a blessing.

My Biggest Advice for Anyone Struggling With Hair Loss:
	•	Take action early. Do NOT wait for it to get worse.
	•	Get a proper diagnosis. Guessing only wastes time and money.
	•	Be consistent and disciplined. Missing days or half-doing your routine WILL slow progress.
	•	Avoid gimmicky “miracle” products. I’ve wasted too much money on useless things marketed on social media. Evidence-based treatments are where results come from.
	•	Build your routine into daily habits. Mine feels as normal as brushing my teeth now.
	•	Most steps can be done while multitasking (scalp massage, red light cap, etc.).
	•	It’s not as expensive as it may look. Many products last months, some are one-time purchases, and honestly people spend much more on salon visits, daily coffees, or weekends out. It’s all about priorities.

If anyone is feeling scared, discouraged, or overwhelmed about starting minoxidil or any hair-loss treatment, please feel free to reach out. I genuinely love helping others who are going through what I went through.

Treating my hair loss has been life-changing. I’m back at work, going out again, and I’m even in a new relationship, things I honestly didn’t think were possible just a few months ago.

I’m incredibly grateful for my progress, and I truly wish every person reading this finds the same relief, confidence, and regrowth.
You are not alone. ❤️

Current Hair Routine:

• 5% Topical Minoxidil – 2x/day
I leave it on for 6–8 hours. I use Growplex Vitafoam, which includes topical DHT blockers and anti-inflammatory ingredients, and it does not irritate my scalp. I apply it with a small eyeshadow brush, parting my hair in sections and pulling the product down the part line.
I’m not sure if I experienced a “dread shed,” since I was already shedding heavily from TE when I started. I’m currently experiencing no shedding and I lose 10 hairs or fewer when brushing after the shower.
For reference: I do have pets and use minoxidil safely. My only side effect has been increased facial hair, which I dermaplane weekly.

• Spironolactone 75 mg – 1x/day
I increased slowly under my doctor’s guidance and had no negative side effects.

• The Ordinary Peptide Hair Serum – 1x/day
Applied 20 minutes after minoxidil.

• Dermarolling – .75 mm titanium roller, 2x/week
I use the Growplex dermaroller. I replace it every 4 months, use it only on a clean, dry scalp, and sanitize it before and after every use. I use it before applying minoxidil.

• Scalp Massages – 4 minutes/day
Done before minoxidil. I use an electric red-light scalp massager (Arboleaf, from Amazon).

• Red Light Cap – 30 minutes/day
My current cap is no longer sold, but I recommend iRestore or Capillus.

• Daily Hair Washing
Products absorb best on a clean, dry scalp. I blow-dry my scalp on cool immediately after showering and never leave it damp.

• Ketoconazole 2% Shampoo – 2x/week
I leave it on for 15 minutes before rinsing.

Other shampoos I rotate:

•	Growplex Revive

•	L’Oréal Elvive Growth Booster

•	OGX Bond Repair
(I double shampoo every wash.)

• Nutrafol Exfoliating Scalp Mask – 1x/week
Used before showering to remove product buildup.

• Plantur 39 Phyto Caffeine Tonic – 2x/week
Left on for 30 minutes pre-shower.

• Strengthening/Repair Products (as needed):
OGX Bond Repair Serum, OGX Coconut Oil, and K18 Leave-In Molecular Hair Mask.

• Keralyt 5 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo – As needed
Left on for 30 minutes before washing. Because of Lupus, I sometimes get dandruff or irritation; this helps clear it and removes buildup.

• Sleep in a silk bonnet nightly

• Avoid:
Tight hairstyles, heat styling, and hair dye.

• Lifestyle:
High-protein diet, lots of water, minimal sugar, processed food, and no alcohol. Exercise 5x per week.

• Supplements (based on my personal deficiencies):
Iron, Vitamin C, Zinc, Folic Acid, Omega-3, Vitamin D, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Probiotics, Collagen, and Magnesium.
I don’t recommend taking supplements unless you’re deficient or low, too much of certain vitamins can actually worsen hair loss.

• Birth control:

1phw8w7,https://chng.it/RxjxzRQCdx,Sonic Fiber in SF UPDATE: We hit 1.5k signatures! Here is the Next Plan to get Sonic in SF,"Hi everyone!

I hope you’re having a good last few weeks of 2025. We have come so far from our initial signatures this past summer. I’m happy to share that as of writing this, we hit 1.5k signatures and have raised about $1k in donations to help promote the petition! Thank you so much for your time to share the initiative to push for Sonic Fiber in SF.

A brief overview for those who may not know, since this past summer, I've been contacting D7's legislative aid and members from Sonic Fiber to see how we can bring this amazing Internet provider across the city.

When Mike Farrah fell silent after a positive meeting, we sought to approach the mayor of San Francisco to make this happen.

I recently caught up with Bill Greenlaw from Sonic's government affairs team to get a better understanding of why things are still stalled in neighborhoods like the Inner Sunset. It really comes down to two main roadblocks:

Microtrenching Depth: Sonic uses ""micro-trenching"" (narrow, shallow cuts in the street) because it’s cost-effective. State law suggests a 12-inch depth is fine, but San Francisco is insisting on 18 inches. Sonic doesn't have the equipment to dig that deep cost-effectively, which stops them from building underground here.

SFMTA Fees: The SFMTA recently brought back a review process that costs Sonic about $10,000 every time they need to cross a trolley line with their wires. This makes it financially impossible for them to expand aerial service in many areas.

Since there's a pause with the city, Sonic is now focusing on the state of California. In Spring 2026, they plan to submit a proposal to the CPUC (California Public Utilities Commission) to update the safety rules (General Order 128). If this passes, it would standardize the 12-inch depth statewide, meaning San Francisco would likely have to accept it.

New Goal: 10k Signatures by Spring
This gives us a clear timeline. To support Sonic when they go to the CPUC, we need to show massive public demand. I’d love for us to reach 10,000 signatures by next Spring.

Next Steps:
I’m going to start organizing a flyering campaign to get the word out in more neighborhoods. If you want to help post flyers in your area (coffee shops, lobbies, etc.), please let me know! I'd also love some ideas on how to allow people to access the flyers - I've been told that signers are unable to view flyers from the petition.

And of course, please keep sharing the petition.Thank you all for your continued support!

TLDR; 10k signatures is needed by spring 2026 to push for Sonic Fiber in San Francisco, please share and post flyers linking the petition if you are able!",58,1765248254.0,sanfrancisco,13,0.95,False

I did a rinse shot and when I went pull my first espresso shot I accidentally didn’t lock in all the way and well it went everywhere… I think this is where I made my next mistake I rinsed out the porter filter and dried it. And tried putting another shot less then a minute later and well it went a lot better except for the fact the porter filter won’t budge and now there’s just wet coffee grounds sitting in the machine I couldn’t find anything on YouTube or in the instruction book to help me with the situation so I went to chat gtp and well it told me to push the espresso shot and steam wand button to shut the machine off and let the puck cool down well I did that and all it did was pull another shot which I can only assume makes the situation worse with pressure. An hour later and it still won’t budge the Porter filter is still warm to the touch i’m hoping it’s not stuck like this for good I don’t wanna leave it like this all night for sanitary reasons and I can’t imagine it being good on the machine chat gtp thinks it’s fine to leave it overnight and the pressure will release by morning but I don’t wanna listen to ChatGPT.

1phw2ry,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1phw2ry/recruiting_szn/,Recruiting szn,"I'm taking a break from studying for finals and want to share/rant about the reality of trying to line up a job after graduating.

Your target is summer of your graduation year, which means you'll need a junior year internship to get a return offer, which means you need to start recruiting your sophomore year, but you should be getting ready for all this stuff your freshman year. Side note: If you don't have a freshman summer internship lined up, that's not ideal but acceptable. You should definitely have a sophomore summer internship.

Fine, you reach out to people on LinkedIn from your school. The only problem is, at least a hundred others are doing the same. It's impossible to standout but maybe you'll get a couple of coffee chats. If you're really lucky, your dick-sucking game will be strong enough to get a referral so your application is flagged in the system.

It's also a good idea to join some clubs. Even if you attend a top school or an Ivy, you're competing against people who all go to top schools and Ivies. You grind out apps for the usual: finance clubs, investing groups, consulting clubs. These clubs will have multiple rounds of interviews and opportunities for coffee chats with current members/alums, so it's actually good prep for down the line.

As recruiting season ramps up, you'll have multiple opportunities to attend info sessions. These are great! You get to hear a bunch of first-year analysts talk about how awesome the company culture is, how strong the mentorship is, and just how much you're going to LEARN throughout your time at the firm. These people will look like they're on the edge of a mental breakdown, but they're just trying to hit the two-year mark so they can bounce over to HF/VC/PE for a position with slightly better hours and a bit more pay. Maybe one day you'll be just like them.

Given that it's 2025, school does not matter. You take whatever classes you need to and use Chat to get through papers and psets. In this economy, your number one priority is getting a job. Everything else is secondary to that. You'll be having plenty of late nights, but it won't be to study for classes, it'll be to keep up with all of the clubs you joined or to practice technicals and behaviorals for interviews.

What a privilege it is to be among the lucky few.

Obviously this is very much a woe is me boohoo writeup, but this is more or less the reality for a majority of students at top schools. At the very least, it's my reality and despite my dissatisfaction there are no better options. Nobody truly cares about changing the world or getting an education. Some humanities majors try, but by the end of their freshman year they're scheduling coffee chats with Bainies just like everyone else. Is it sad? Yeah, kind of.

The kind of morning that’s unusually quiet, when the sunlight just barely spills into the living room, turning the sofa into a warm, golden spot. The air is a little chilly, but I’m wrapped in a soft blanket, my feet near the fire, completely sunk into the sofa—no thoughts, no rush.

It’s freezing outside, but inside, it’s just perfectly cozy.

You can hear the faintest whisper of wind, but it doesn’t bother you.

And when the sunlight hits your face for that brief second, you suddenly realize—life can actually be pretty gentle.

Nothing big is happening, no goals to chase,

yet in that moment, you feel like the world is softly hugging you.

This simple, grounded kind of happiness—it’s addictive, honestly.

I (28M) reached out to an ex-girlfriend (29F) from college (a “one that got away” situation) recently on a whim, it had been 8-10 years since we had last communicated in any way. We were both in our hometown for the holidays and I asked if she wanted to grab dinner or coffee.

We ended up exchanging pretty rapid texts and catching up for 4-5 hours. Heard from her again a few days later, then the conversation petered out.

We’re from the same city initially, but now each live about an hour outside of it in different directions. About an hour and half apart from one another.

I initially asked about coffee or dinner, and she had said she’d let me know when she was back in our city for the holidays. These were basically our first messages.

She happened to run into my college roommate (who she knows I am still close to because of our conversation) and mentioned she was single, which he and his fiancée thought was kind of a random thing to say at the time.

I’m passing through her city for work next week and I’m extremely tempted to reach out. It’s been about two weeks since we texted, and I’m worried that I am misinterpreting politeness for (at least casual) interest or that reaching out would make it seem like I have an agenda other than catching up (which, if I’m being honest, I absolutely do).

I’m a working adult who has had several relationships since this one, I have no idea why I’m thinking about it so much.

Would you talk to an old ex that you ended on rough terms with just to be polite?

Should I reach out again with an actual invite or just wait a few more weeks to see if she actually does around the holidays?

Should I try to play it cool or not bother trying to hide my intentions?

We were having a conversation awhile back about how there MUST be other people of our age-range who are seeking similar community - people to have a weekly coffee-clatch to discuss current events and other deep/philisophical topics, folks to have emotionally-vulnerable connections without the need to establish romantic connections, etc. 

I’m curious if there are other folks out there (aged 30’s - 60’s, as life experiences are vital to the connection processes) who are interested in this sort of dynamic, and who might be willing to have a meet & greet to establish those connections and really build a solid community?

First off, if you don’t think men can be abused, don’t comment. I’m embarrassed enough as is. 

Anyway, I was seeing this girl for a few months. We were both 20 at the time and met online. She seemed sweet over message, and we agreed to have a date after a few weeks. I went to her place, and spent about 7-8 hours with her. It was great! We walked around town, stopped for a coffee and dinner, and I left feeling good about her. 
Fast forward a few weeks and we decide to see each other exclusively. I started to sleep at her house and we’d spend days at a time together. In retrospect, it was extremely fast. I know that. 
One day, some dumb inconvenience happened, and we had a small argument. Before I knew it, they became more frequent. She would yell at me and strike my face (I would’ve left but I didn’t want to admit to anyone I was hit by a girl). 
I eventually gathered the strength to leave one night, after she blew up at me. She yelled, cursed at me, and hit me. When I told her that I was going to leave, she lost it completely. She began throwing her head back into the wall full force, throwing a tantrum much like a toddler. Then she said she was going to k*** herself if I left, and it would be my fault. She then said that she was sorry for hitting me, but that no one would ever believe me if I disclosed the attacks. 

Now, two years later, I still have dreams of that final night. I have a wonderful woman in my life, and I feel like I’m in a very good place. It’s just the nightmares that haunt me. I can’t forget the physical pain that shed cause me, and I feel ashamed that I didn’t leave the very first time it happened. 
I flinch sometimes when my girlfriend comes up behind me, and I have to lie when she asks me why. I don’t want her to know that I was beaten.  ",1,1765247326.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

although i reached out in september, we met up in november due to our busy schedules. we met up at a place in between is at 10:30 am to get coffee, which he paid for. we talked in a park for a few goes, after that wandered around a nearby bookstore, and then got a late lunch/early dinner, which he also paid for. our day ended at 4 pm and we both went our separate ways. he texted me less than an hour after leaving how we had good timing due to the rain. he said it was nice catching up and he was glad i made it home safely. 

i was the last person to text, and i haven’t heard from him since that day. i know he travelled for the thanksgiving holiday and needs to get back into routines before continuing contact (it’s happened before). i see a lot of green flags with things he’s said to me, him paying and effortlessly spending a whole day together. we didn’t necessarily mention a next time, but when he paid for dinner, i offered to help pay and he said no, so i said i’d get him next time, and he said he’d probably just pay again due to his bad memory. 

i overthink a lot, especially when i like someone. so even though shooting a text isn’t a big deal like i did before, but it’s an awkward situation of the both of us not knowing where each others heads are at. i think im just looking for a green light from someone else to just do it, but any advice about the situation is appreciated<3 ",1,1765247287.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I’ve been taking lessons with a French tutor for about a month now on Preply. On a personal level, we get along great—the vibes are good and he’s a really nice guy. The problem is, I feel like I’m not actually learning anything.

For context, my level is pretty low (I can barely order a coffee fluently without stumbling).

We constantly have rude customers and stuff, that is the joy of working in guest set jobs, but there was one customer who constantly was rude, we will call her Mary. Mary would always pay in cash to avoid the new credit card fees we have (yay tariffs) and would randomly add change once we cashed her out so we would have to reopen her order/check out to remember the price of what she bought and how much she gave us to figure out what we are supposed to give her back. It’s annoying and a whole process but whatever, the customer is always right I guess. 

Which leads me to my breaking point, one of my coworkers was checking her out. This coworker struggles with math and stuff. She is bright but is sometimes slower with math because she has dyscalculia. Mary pulls her usually BS and adds change after checking out so my coworker pulls out a calculator to make sure her math is correct. Mary then makes a comment “that’s the problem with this generation. You younger generations don’t know how to do math anymore.” Excuse me, what? I was fusing but kept my best customers service face and just waited until she left to lose my cool. I kept replaying the moment in my head and kept thinking of what I could’ve done when finally it hit me.

The next time Mary came back to our store, I intentionally became her cashier. I checked her out and she did the same thing of adding change after the order was complete. So I did the same thing my coworker did and pulled out a calculator. As expected Mary made a comment about how “this younger generation is stupid because that can’t to basic math.” I put on the best acting performance of my LIFE and said, “I suppose that’s what happens when you have a brain tumor.” Mary went PALE. I pretended to hold back tears as I gave her back her change and watched her leave. 

Anyway, hopefully that will stop her from making comments about my coworkers and will stop make everyone’s jobs harder.

Matched with a nice guy that I went on one coffee date over the weekend (first date ever) and we had a lovely time and I really like him, it also ended up lasting 5 hours? Not sure if that’s good? We have another planned in a week’s time, so we messaged for about 5-6 days before the first date, and have been continuously messaging since (and I mean alll day).

And I’m struggling, I’m not a huge texter and the constant back and forth has me really stumped what to say sometimes and I can feel from his responses that he probably thinks the same thing.

Do I be honest and bring it up? Let the conversation fizzle out and then message again leading up to the date if we’re still going? Do they fizzle out usually? I feel like we really got along during the first date but is the fizzling texting a bad sign?
