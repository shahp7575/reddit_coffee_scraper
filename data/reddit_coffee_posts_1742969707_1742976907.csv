We were extremely good friends before it happened. sometimes I find myself missing him. I feel like I have disassociated and compartmentalized the experience so much that I almost forget how much he has destroyed me. I can‚Äôt help but want to reach out and ask to get coffee or something. We have not talked since the day after it happened almost a year ago. I feel like something is wrong with me. He told many people that I was lying about it for attention (even though i kept it a secret and a friend of mine I confided in was the one to spread it). I know he is terrible and yet I still fantasize about us working things out. ,1,1742976881.0,rapecounseling,1,1.0,False
1jk6sne,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSDD/comments/1jk6sne/i_went_to_a_rave_this_weekend/,I went to a Rave this weekend,"So im gonna preface this with a **TW: Drugs/alcohol mentioned.**

1. I live in Canada. So... idk if that changes things here. (BODY AGE 32)
I so i've posted in here before, but I just wanted to mention again, who I am without giving my details away...
I have suspected but not confirmed (by psychiatrist) OSDD-1B. WE ARE AWARE OF FIVE FRACTURED ALTARS AND TWO FULL SEPARATE ALTARS(1 WHO DOES NOT COME OUT.) Idk why that went CAPS on me I'm sorry... not yelling.
...Anywho....
Saturday night, I was getting ready to go out to a rave. At the rave, I had five drinks and fifteen milligrams of t h c. I was one of the first people out on the dance floor and I'll be honest. It was a great time I had fun. I didn't want to do more than what I was doing and it was great. My friend showed up and things were going good. Danced sang along it was magic.... I even had my own main character event where the light flashed on me and the DJ looked at me pointed and i was so in that moment... It was super cool. It was overall a great night.
 However, towards the end of the night.I sent my friend home because they wanted to leave, but I wasn't ready to go...I guess... which #1 red flag... i don't do that. üôÉ... im a party mom... i make sure everyone else is good and safe and leave with them.. no man elft behind deal... #2. I wanted to walk home after apparently... it was only 2¬∞C (35.6¬∞F). I only had a hoodie on (denim jeans and shoes) and my walk was 2.3km. (1.42mi)

I apparently started walking when my friend tracked my phone (previous arrangement for this sorta thing in case  set up years ago) and picked me up. She grabbed a iced cap from tim hortons for me. And we apparently drove me home... 
I left the bar at 140am and got home at 240am... i last looked at my phone/clock at 1243... i remembered that as the last thing and remember getting sick on the toilet when I got home... (which is part of why i though I was drugged.) Something I'm basically missing just shy of 2 hours of time completely gone... this is not my normal I usually always front/cohost... like 98% of the time.

Now to back track as to why I think it was actually a full switch instead of being drugged is because, according to my friend who picked me up, I drank my ice cap in under 5 minutes, which is approximately 22oz of ice cold coffee slush (mines made with oat milk). I was very cold and distant to her barely talking... (not my normal- even if im high or intoxicated in anyway, I blab... anyways...). And we can't remember almost a full 2 hours of time? Makes me think our ""Dormant"" full alter (one who legit causes amniesa) came out. 

When I woke up 6ish hours later I was sober and totally okay. Last drink was around 1230. So couldn't have been from alcohol and I had 15 mg of Cannibis /thc-Edibles. (I usually have that reguardless). 

Idk what the trigger was other than having a ""MAIN CHARACTER"" Moment during the rave. 

Im duped. I'm sharing because this is the first full event like this that wasn't a crisis event (a whole other thing related to DID.) 
Anyone else ever have this?

Ps. I'm sorry this is written poorly brain is navigating this all still and it's upsetting.

1jk6sf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1jk6sf0/the_owl_knows_part_1/,""" THE OWL KNOWS "" : Part 1","Alex in an overlarge, frayed sweater even in the library's stifling heat, had the perpetually rumpled look of a man who spent more time with pages than with mirrors. His black hair always fell into his eyes, which were a jarringly bright blue, always watching, searching. He read history, not dates and names, but the human undertow that moved beneath the surface, the faulty, contradictory truths the official accounts usually smoothed over. It was in this search for truth that he had been driven now, deeper into the library's belly.



He ran his hand over the parchmented spine of the book, its vellum well-tanned and cold against his fingertips. He wasn't where he was meant to be in the section of rare books, but the digital archive had brought him here, a paper cross-reference in a world that was quickly forgetting itself in the intangible history. He was twenty-one and a history major, but the stories he chased weren't on pages. They were whispers, specters of protests two decades ago, consumed by the digital tide.



He was not drawn, as his contemporaries were, to the promise of what was to be, not in this world of hidden interfaces and boundless connectivity. He preferred the confused, human reality submerged in the past. But lately, the past had felt‚Ä¶ staged. He had been reading about the twenty-year-old protest movements. Not the famous ones, but the little, local rebellions that had come to nothing, the ones that hadn't made it into the books. Rumors about them had been passed down to him when he was growing up. Whispers quickly forgotten. Now, attempting to track down information, he was running into digital brick walls. Academic articles disappeared from databases. Forum threads became 404 errors. Even the university archives themselves were incomplete.



He followed the smudged ink of a hand-written message left in the book. A message from a leader of the protests whose name he had seen being removed from hundreds of on-line sources, Professor Anya Sharma. A commanding, unflinching voice cutting through the made-up din.



It wasn't that there was no information. The hairs prickled at the back of his neck. Not what was lacking, it was what existed. The fact that there was so much good, nearly the same, content made it‚Ä¶ manufactured. He read some of the articles on a few news websites on his battered datapad. Same words, same pictures, same overall conclusions. As if someone had dictated and everyone else was reading from it. He became increasingly uneasy. Was he going crazy?



He'd heard her speak before, Anya Sharma, a whirlwind of drive with a cascade of fire-engine red hair, who'd set his heart afire about exploring hidden histories. She was infectious, her arguments biting and cutting. He'd planned to enroll in her class last semester, but her name couldn't be discovered in the class schedule. Logging on for more information turned up nothing but a dormant university page and a random assortment of dead links. She'd been deleted, as though.



""Stress,"" the university administrator had burbled, a woman with an unnervingly vacant smile, ""Professor Anya needs some mandated Wellness time. You know, for her own good.""



Alex snorted to himself. Anya, a woman who survived on mental sparring and black coffee, required ""Wellness time"" was like informing a shark that it had to be taught to swim. He traced the note again with his finger. Below the quote, in a trembling hand, was the single word: ""Foxwood."" His heart pounded. Foxwood Forest was on the outskirts of town, twenty miles, and renowned for its dense, unmapped wilderness. What ailed it?



Then, in the suburbs, out in the sticks twenty miles outside of town, Sam clashed with a stuck-up conveyor belt at the OptiCorp plant, the metal ring clanging in the empty room. He was a man sliding to fat, thin brown hair and all-around sleep-deprived eyes. Divorced at 32, relegated to living with his elderly mother, and grasping for dear life onto the delusion that his online identity was significant. Comfort in publishing online. Creating memes, rants, simply commenting on topical matters ‚Äì a harmless rant, he rationalized. A means to connect.



But recently, his posts appeared to be disappearing. Comments disappeared. Likes reduced. His following stagnated. He rationalized it with algorithm changes at first, the whimsical fancies of social media gods. But deep within, a knot of fear developed in his stomach.



And then came the shadowban. He discovered that his tweets were no longer visible to anyone who didn't already follow him. His efforts to engage in larger conversations were ignored. He was yelling into a cyber abyss. He felt isolated, invisible.



It began after he'd posted a meme that took a thinly veiled shot at the government's latest economic plan. Nothing too inflammatory, just some light-hearted satire that consisted of a cartoon pig munching from a trough labelled ""National Treasury."" But the consequences had been quick and insidious.



He attempted to post in other groups, on new accounts. They were immediately flagged and suspended. He grew increasingly uncomfortable. He was no radical. He was not violating any laws. He was merely talking. Or at least, he thought so.



On his lunch break, he scrolled through the tightly-restricted news feeds on his corporate-issue phone, the sole access to information the corporate network provided. Each article was a hymn to the ruling regime, celebrating the booming economy and unshakable public trust. A tide of bitterness swept over him, leaving a metallic aftertaste in his mouth. It all felt‚Ä¶staged, a scripted play intended to sedate the sheeple into complacency.



As he returned to his own desk, his phone vibrated in his hand with a text message. From a mysterious number: ""They're watching. Watch what you say."" His breath caught up.



Sam's heart was racing, a thudding bass of fear against his ribcage. He glanced around, tightly, as if he might catch the hidden watchers. He couldn't shake the feeling there were eyes on him, unseen, following his every step. He erased the message, his fingers shaking so hard he almost let the phone slip from his hands. The sound of the factory was cacophonous, stifling. He knew, with a chill in his bones, that his worst was yet to come. And then he received another text: Foxwood Forest. The Owl Knows. His heart shot up a level. The Owl Knows? Was that a joke, or something more sinister? He didn't know what to do, whom to trust. Fear heavy and airless, accumulated in his chest. He was trapped.

Day 1-10 absolutely sucked, ups and downs with anxiety and cravings. And this odd brain flip/dizzy spells hard to explain but scared the dog shit out of me. This odd feeling was pretty constant and my most worrying symptom. Sleep was ok not the best 

Day 11-45 LOW energy, brain fog, and disconnection. 
Sleep has been ok a little better than before. No cravings except randomly. Some anxiety spells one or two that were awful but ended quickly. 

Day 45-90 energy back, brain fog mostly gone, enjoying life again. Memories and good feelings from things I haven‚Äôt felt in years came back. 

Day 90!!!! Fucking doom and gloom!!!! But this was 1000% self inflicted and probably has been around my whole withdrawal period.

So I was making big adjustments trying to make myself feel better. food, I ate all the junk food (I‚Äôm 100% carnivor prior to quitting ZYN) 

I cut coffee by like 75% to slow the possibility of anxiety (probably worked) but also a big swing for a person that‚Äôs not doing well.

I‚Äôm still exercising regularly, weights in the morning and cardio at night. 

All the GABA supplements (didn‚Äôt work for me made things worse)

Magnesium (worked magic for me)

Theanine (some days it helped some days made it worse I think it‚Äôs the GABA component
For me)

So let‚Äôs get back to 90 day attack.

I felt like I was losing ground, heart palpitations, anxiety here and there not bad but very present. For the last 2 weeks or so. 

I had been doing ice baths and sauna everyday I could since quitting. Been drinking 2 gallons of water a day for a while. Not taking my vitamins or anything consistently because of travel. I fasting a lot sometimes for 24 hours. This day I ran 7 miles at a fast pace, 20 minutes of sauna. Then as a reward I ate a big steak and had a bunch of dates, like a whole box. About 30 min later full blown panic attack. One of the worst yet.

Got through the night, took lots of magnesium to calm down, took potassium cause it was there (it wasn‚Äôt even mine) took a Thorne multivitamin. And started to feel better within 30 min. 

met with my doctor and explained this whole ordeal. He believes my last attack was because of hyponatremia. 

Been taking my vitamins, magnesium, potassium, D3. For about 3 days now. Heart palpitations are completely gone. 

I believe i have changed so many things in the last thee months I haven‚Äôt let my mind get used to anything and I wonder how many other people could be in the same situation. I had to share, I feel better hearing that from a medical professional who deals with addiction and the recovery. 

Sorry for the long post and the spelling errors I‚Äôm just excited to share with you all. You guys have helped me so much through this.

Everything they can possibly say to avoid one simple truth. It's your own fault!

You will write about how you do all this womanly stuff for your man and he treats like the little queen that you are. Probably to remind the men reading this that you do in fact ""Have a boyfriend"". Wouldn't want them trying to spend time with you. Those fkn peasants!

And that's the whole reason for this movement. The unspoken truth of it all. You all have developed this idea in your head that somehow you are special! Men are here to serve your needs unquestionably and without hesitation.

I for one am tired of being called a serial killer or potential rapist for asking a woman ""Hey, do you want to hangout later this week"".

God forbid we get to know eachother, I'm only 5'11"" and make 70k a year, that would just be crazy I know!

What would the followers think? They won't be cutting the lawn or fixing the car but their opinion really does make a difference. 

Your ego isn't our top priority ladies!

If I have a friend who treats me badly, I'm gonna go find another friend. It's the same thing with dating.

The woman overseas aren't the hapless victims you make them out to be. They're very intelligent and very aware.

The difference is everything you make a big deal out of, they don't! I could spend a whole day just hanging out with them and they would be happy.

I could take you ladies to space and you would be like ""Well I was hoping to get dinner after""

You're posts on this sub are ironic because you don't discourage men from from going overseas. You reinforce the reason why they're doing it.

Where are the posts in here saying ""Hey guys we love you, you don't have to go overseas, love is right here waiting for you.""

There's nothing like that. Instead all I see is ""You're a bunch of fuckboys"", ""those women are using you"", ""you can't get laid in your own country"", ""those women are poor and stupid"". 

Notice how that sounds? Now imagine hearing that everyday from the women in your society and then going overseas and hearing nothing.

Everything is peaceful, everything is calm. You are are grabbing coffee with a woman. You two met yesterday and exchanged numbers. You're going to walk around the city and get to know eachother, maybe it will lead to something, maybe it won't. There's not going to be any hate or anger no matter the outcome. You spend money on her because it feels normal. She doesn't expect it but appreciates it. She might not want you, but still will be kind and make you feel good.

The End!

The reality here is a lot of men want experiences none of the woman in our countries will provide. So why is it so shocking that they would leave to go find it?

It's not about sex or cooking dinner. The women overseas just treat us like human beings and act like human beings.",1,1742975716.0,thepassportbros,5,0.57,False

# Hey, fellow code nerds! Let‚Äôs chat about something wild‚Äîhow AI and machine learning are sneaking into software engineering and making it way cooler. Remember when coding was just us, a keyboard, and a lot of coffee? Now, AI‚Äôs like our super-smart sidekick.

Take tools like GitHub Copilot‚Äîit‚Äôs basically autocomplete on steroids. You start typing, and bam, it suggests whole chunks of code. I tried it, and it‚Äôs spooky how it guesses what I want‚Äîlike it‚Äôs reading my mind! It‚Äôs trained on tons of code, so it‚Äôs great for boilerplate stuff or even debugging. But it‚Äôs not just about writing code faster. ML‚Äôs changing how we test, too. Tools can now predict where bugs might pop up based on patterns‚Äîless guesswork, more precision.

Then there‚Äôs the big picture: AI‚Äôs helping design smarter systems. Think self-optimizing apps or chatbots that actually understand you. I saw a demo where ML auto-refactored messy code into something clean‚Äîmind blown. And don‚Äôt get me started on DevOps‚ÄîML‚Äôs predicting server crashes before they happen.

Of course, it‚Äôs not perfect. AI can spit out wonky code, and you‚Äôve gotta double-check it (no blind trust here). Plus, it‚Äôs kinda creepy thinking machines might take over coding entirely‚Äîthough I think we‚Äôre safe for now. For CSE pros, it‚Äôs a chance to level up‚Äîlearn some ML basics, play with TensorFlow, and you‚Äôre ahead of the curve.

It‚Äôs exciting, right? AI‚Äôs not replacing us; it‚Äôs amplifying us. Have you tried any AI coding tools yet? Spill your thoughts‚ÄîI‚Äôm all ears!",1,1742975664.0,eduvision,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm always up for new adventures, and there‚Äôs nothing better than a good conversation over coffee or tea.

I value connections that are built on mutual respect. Lately, I have realised time passes by pretty fast, and it‚Äôs the experiences we have over the time that makes us happy. Let‚Äôs connect and explore together!

A neighbour and fellow dog lover was telling me over coffee about her general frustration am with doctors and communication. Apparently, when she was coming out anaesthesia for an elective hysterectomy her gynaecologist bounded over, clearly delighted with himself, and told her he'd taken the time to explore her other organs laparoscopically and discovered a bladder cancer. He told her how much she'll thank him because he caught it so early, and then referred her to a colleague. She had to tell her husband while still fuzzy that she had cancer. And she's now had treatment and done really well, and she is grateful. But it stands out to her still as such an unempathetic way to tell someone they have cancer. 

....and I just so get this. I completely understand why that gynaecologist was so pleased with himself, and so laissez faire about the cancer. And while I hope I never do the same thing I can see a scenario in the future where I'm so wrapped up in my practice I forget what it's like for non-doctors. A ",12,1742975148.0,ausjdocs,13,1.0,False

However now she decided we should move to downtown Houston which is fine... but we have 3 dogs and she needed an all White House with a ""huge closet , ""huge kitchen , "" all white kitchen"". And 4 stories with a rooftop (I like the rooftop but that's it) she doesn't even cook she doesn't use the rooftop besides  once  a week and with all these other conditions we give up tons of options with huge backyards and even medium sized for dogs to run around she just wanted to move ASAP and honestly picked the worst decision 

Now I get irritated often with her because. Our dogs are aggressive so we walk them at night but now she doesn't wanna walk them at night, I complain she doesn't even use the kitchen and made a dining room area that we never use or ever have guest to sit at and took away area from our dogs , got a backyard with no grass and only rocks all for this urban hell and it's making me so depressed I hate downtown cities it's not my thing at al like I don't want make ANY friends here ever 

She complains about me being irritated but really I stayed home for her so I could move states or whatever for college but this urban hell is making me genuinely depressed I strive in nature , nice southern people and minimal highways with tons of churches around me , scenic drives , big backyards ,  things like cars and coffee but al we have here is illegal car meets , traffic full highways , packed restaurants , no trails ,   Churches  full of people who don't talk to one another  and this tiny ass backyard 

Sorry for repeating my self but I hate urban hell and honesty can't wait to get out in  2 years I'd also  love to know if in over reacting how to make the most of it? Cause I don't wanna get angry at her but she promised we'd stay home if I didn't leave and when we were  moving said we'd get a big backyard and she didn't follow up on that harming our dogs which now causes me depression seeing my 16 year old dog sad she can't run around

So i am getting these for hobby/experimenting for my love of coffee. I start with Bambino Plus and O Lagom Casa (65). They are not cheap (or relatively not for beginner). They are still in the returnable period for me.

My question is anyone want to share experience of splurging for hobby and regretting it later (i would say that these machines could turn into a nice furniture ü§£) or how do you keep motivating and using them and end up upgrading after a few years and being more and more.

Alcoholic, and when she drinks at night she has a tendency to start arguments and cannot be rational but when she is sober she completely shuts down and dismisses the issue. When she drinks she turns into a totally different person.

My sister and I pay her 300 a month in ‚Äúrent‚Äù. We both send her $150 bi weekly to cover it. 

Since my mom and I got into another one of her outbursts about 3 weeks ago we haven‚Äôt spoken. 

She messaged me yesterday at 9AM asking me to do ‚Äúmy‚Äù dishes which I did all of ‚Äúmy‚Äù dishes the day before which weren‚Äôt even in the sink. It was 3 cups (one was my daughters, and one was my ninja and the other was my Stanley that were all left in my car for like a week üòñ) and the rest were my one year olds plates that I always rinse and throw on her bottle rack until I have time to scrub them with soap. I eat off of paper plates and plastic forks because my mom and sisters do not do dishes. Everything piles up in the sink for weeks it is dirty and there is literally no space to wash. So I just try to avoid it all together. Point is I didn‚Äôt have dishes in the sink. 

Like I said mom has a lot of issues. She never does dishes, sweeps, mops, leaves moldy food in fridge, or moldy coffee cups, or moldy bathroom. She is just dirty. She doesn‚Äôt ask for help either because it‚Äôs not something that bothers her. So, the fact that she texted me asking to do dishes was just another attempt for her to start drama with me because she NEVER asks nor cares about dishes.

So that‚Äôs when I messaged both of my sisters asking if she asked them to do dishes. MIND YOU, the sink was full of my sister, my mom, and my other sisters dishes. So both of my sisters said ‚Äúno she didn‚Äôt ask us‚Äù again targeting me. 

It‚Äôs been an issue because I work, have a ones year old, and go to school 4 days a week. My other sisters are much more available than I am so I‚Äôm confused why she is constantly asking me to do stuff.

So when I was asking my 21 year old sis about it she says ‚Äúyeah she was talking about you the other day and how she is stressed about bills because you haven‚Äôt paid her.‚Äù 

So I open my cash app to tell her (my sis) that I sent my mom $300 on Thursday, and the Thursday before I sent her $720. 

I used to send $150 bi weekly but ever since I cut back my hours at work, I‚Äôve had to send $300 monthly which I spoke with my mother about. Last payment was 2/19 this payment was 3/12 so they were less than one month apart. 

Regardless, as I‚Äôm showing my sis our cash app transactions, I realize in October 2024, I got paid 3x that month and sent her an extra $150. My sis ended up doing the same, and also lost track of one of her December payments sending my mom $600 that month without even realizing it. 

Would I be an asshole for asking my mom for the money back, calling her out for not speaking up about receiving extra, and calling her out for lying to my sister about ‚Äúnot paying her‚Äù? 

Another side note is that she is bestfriends with one of my bestfriends mom. She is always telling my bestfriends mom about our personal fights, who then tells her daughter (my friend) about it. I don‚Äôt have any way to defend my self and it makes things like birthdays, family dinners, etc. awkward for me. 

Another side note is I cannot move out right this second due to other circumstances I can‚Äôt get into so I really just feel stuck right now but want to separate as much as I can.",5,1742973531.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

M25, F27","What is the normal level of anger expected in a long term relationship? My (F,27) partner (M, 26) of 6 years can be an angry person day to day but Im not sure what is pushing the limit. For context I moved with him 4 years ago to follow him to a job and have since worked from home and have not made any friends/don't really have family to talk to. I understand that even the question itself may seem ridiculous to ask, but having no one to talk to for a couple of years has led me to question what is 'normal' and what should be concerning. My boyfriend has had issues with anger that seems to be getting worse with time though he has never physically been aggressive towards me, he can be quite unpredictable emotionally. Most recently, he has had to go on a trip that required him to buy a suit and asked if I could go with him and help him find what he needed. I had just stopped being sick from the flu in the last 24hrs but I was happy to help and agreed. We went and because I hadn't left the house in 3 weeks we talked about going to get lunch at a restaurant down the street before heading to the store. I had bad hives from being sick and forgot my ointment and when I asked him to pull back into our complex when we were less than 2 minutes away I had to deal with him sighing heavily and rolling his eyes even though I apologized immensely. All he said is I just don't want to leave the house and he was mad that he had to leave (even though the whole trip was for him to get his things). He games quite a bit and needs to game at least once a day or he gets upset and says that there is no time in the day so I assumed he was mad that he had to buy a suit and not be gaming. He is quite wealthy so its not like the idea of buying a suit which is expensive was anymore than just a card swipe. We went to the restaurant and I assured him over and over again that its ok to be upset but that he can't punish me for simple mistakes and he agreed. When we finally go to the store I led the whole trip I found him everything he needed with him following behind me. The store did not have his size of undershirts so I suggested we walk to target (1 store down from us) and just get one there which resulted in him throwing another fit. I didn't know what to do because I had barely even talked the whole time and I was there to help him but it felt like he was treating me as if I had dragged him out of the house. The whole trip sucked, he apologized but in ways that require more work of me to help him regulate his emotions. 

Today he left for his trip. Last night he told me to not let him sleep past his alarm and I offered to order him a coffee and breakfast in the morning to which he agreed sounded nice. In the morning I woke up early and made sure he stayed awake when his alarm went off despite him protesting. He was immediately angry and told me he was going to go make a coffee. When I asked if he still wanted his coffee order delivered he blew up again, shaking his hands in the air saying that im pressuring him and I was overwhelming him and 'I just want to make a coffee is that so bad'. All I told him is that I was just following what he told me to do. He then go mad raising his voice complaining that he was already fucking everything up. When he gets angry I don't talk and I just sit and listen. I stepped away and eventually he came to me and told he just wants to drive to the coffee shop. This was all about 10 minutes after he woke up so I offered to drive which also made him upset saying things like 'cant I just drive my car?' so he did and I stayed quiet. At home while he ate his breakfast I asked him if I could pack his suit in his bag. The night before I packed all of his toiletries because he had nothing packed so far but I was offering to just gather his clothes and things and put it in the bag. I felt crazy because the question had barely left my lips before he was saying 'I don't want you to you keep insisting to pack my bag and won't stop'. it was the first time I had asked. I sat down and let him get it all out and get upset and tell me why I had upset him and then I eventually got back in bed, it was only 6 am. He showered and came back trying to be nice again and I told him that he is allowed to be stressed, upset, or disagree but I will not be ok with being disrespected. He seemed to be talking to himself more than me when he was agreeing and saying 'I just fuck everything up'. Then he left. This was all in the span of barely an hour and I am so confused of what this means for his mental health. Im not sure if this is just anger of if I should be concerned about an issue that deeper than things like anxiety. Days like this are not new but he goes from on top of the world and sweet and funny to scary and unpredictable so fast, I fear normalizing behavior that may need professional help and I fear being dramatic and not having thick enough skin.

I‚Äôve experimented with my diet pretty thoroughly, and I‚Äôve noticed a weird but very consistent pattern:
I only break out if I eat breakfast.

It doesn‚Äôt matter what I eat ‚Äî I‚Äôve tried:
	‚Ä¢	High protein (just steak or eggs)
	‚Ä¢	High fat, low carb
	‚Ä¢	Carnivore-style (only meat)
	‚Ä¢	Zero sugar, no dairy, no processed food
	‚Ä¢	Even just a tiny bit of milk in coffee

Every time, the outcome is the same: I break out, and I feel mentally off (sluggish, anxious, less confident). Which just can‚Äôt happen because I run a large roofing business which is very physically and mentally demanding. But if I don‚Äôt eat breakfast ‚Äî and fast for the first 4‚Äì5 hours after waking up ‚Äî my skin stays clear and I feel sharp.

The only things that don‚Äôt cause issues:
	‚Ä¢	Black coffee
	‚Ä¢	Zero-calorie energy drinks
	‚Ä¢	Electrolytes (no sugar, no calories)

So it‚Äôs not a specific food group ‚Äî it‚Äôs literally anything with calories in the morning that sets it off.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it hormonal? Insulin-related? Cortisol timing? I‚Äôm really curious if anyone knows why this happens or has had the same experience.

Practice makes perfect, right?  Cheers to another year of caffeinated creativity!

Equipment used:
1. Flair Signature espresso maker
- This has been my best investment, much more control over the espresso shots.

2. Kingrinder K6
- One of the best and cheapest espresso capable grinder, initially used Timemore C3 modded with a 36-click plate, K6 is such an upgrade over it, consistent grinds, balanced flavours and quickly grinds.

3. Agaro temp controlled Electric kettle
- not the best, but does the work, has temp overshooting issue.

4. Country Bean's Stainless steel milk frother 
- easy to use but messy to clean, needs a weekly deep cleaning.

I already went there for coffee so when he started I continued to go almost daily & we‚Äôd talk a lot. I felt something more than friendship between us & others did too, but I didn‚Äôt want to be weird at his job.

After a few months I asked him to join my friends for trivia which was fun. He drank a LOT & I suspected he did coke but wasn‚Äôt sure. He wanted to go on a trip w/ my friends but didn‚Äôt (later found out his ex came back around & that was one of the reasons he didn‚Äôt). After the 1st hangout there was a 3 month period where we didn‚Äôt hangout. He never replied to my text about a 2nd trivia, so I assumed he didn‚Äôt want to hang again. We continued to talk regularly at coffee.

3 months later he text me about trivia & from that point we hung out 1-2x a week from mid Nov through mid-Jan. He came to my bday + other hangouts. His friend always hinted there‚Äôs something between us & how he always wants to come see me, but we just stayed friends - some light flirting on both our parts but he needed time before dating again & looked at me intently after saying that - it almost seemed like he was trying to tell me that? Wasn‚Äôt outwardly directed toward me, tho.

One night, he asked me a question about dating apps & had a funny look on his face when he looked intently at me. A few days later I saw that he liked me on tinder at some point recently (I got a week worth of seeing who liked me lol) & I ended up matching with him & sending ‚Äúhi!‚Äù when I was drunk one night but never acknowledged it. I thought maybe he accidentally swiped? But after that we continued hanging out & it never got weird at all so I assumed maybe he didn‚Äôt even see my message.

He wrote me a note at my birthday about how honored & grateful he was that he can call me a friend; good people are hard to find but I‚Äôm the exception, among other things. It was a very kind.

We hung out about 4/5 times in Jan and it was fun. I did realize he has an addiction issue (uses coke about every hour when we‚Äôd hang). He said he can go days being awake & then crash, &  if he doesn‚Äôt reply to my text he never take it personally; it‚Äôs not that he doesn‚Äôt want to see me, he‚Äôs bad with his texts‚Ä¶.

Mid/end of Jan (a week after I had just hung out with him) he asked me about hanging but cancelled saying he was in a bad mood & didn‚Äôt want to be grumpy around me. Next day he was super apologetic but we didn‚Äôt hang out again. About a week after this I noticed he was gone from my tinder matches, so either he deleted the account or unmatched? 

A week later he text at 3:30am ‚Äúcan you hangout‚Äù but edited it to ‚Äúca‚Äù so I assumed he was messed up & decided against reaching out. 

A few weeks ago I called & he called me back & we hung out, but he was messed up & I didn‚Äôt get the feeling he wanted to hang so I‚Äôm not sure why he called back. His friend asked why we hadn‚Äôt hung out & if we were arguing ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. We got in his car for a bit & talked & he told me he was in a pretty bad place. He said he knows he shouldn‚Äôt be doing so much coke & just didn‚Äôt seem okay. It was a short hangout. 

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone that‚Äôs an outsider to this situation can shed some light on this. Bottom line is we were becoming good friends and I‚Äôm not sure why all of a sudden he doesn‚Äôt want to hangout anymore. I have never been too forward with my feelings towards him because I appreciated our friendship & I knew he wasn‚Äôt in the place to date even IF he also had feelings for me.

I have a feeling this is part of his addiction and mental health struggles but I haven‚Äôt been friends with someone going through this & wanted input.

I want him to be okay and to be there for him but at this point I don‚Äôt want to be annoying so I haven‚Äôt reached out. I see him once in a while at coffee (I definitely go less now) & he updated me on a lot of stuff last week & really wanted to talk. He mentioned he‚Äôd been sober the past week because he wasn‚Äôt able to go anywhere for a while after his car broke down & he seemed in a better place sober for sure‚Ä¶ ",1,1742972709.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1jk5xt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jk5xt6/hunting_season_part_one/,Hunting Season [Part One],"There is no red more red than freshly spilt blood on freshly fallen snow. 

Just-plucked rose petals on white satin sheets? Overripe strawberries in a saucer of cream? Lust is certainly a deep shade of crimson. Gluttony has its hues of rouge, too. But both pale in comparison to the ruby red glow of fresh death frozen in time.

* * *

I'd noticed the first flakes slowly drifting down outside the window of a Denny's about two hours into our drive up north. My best friend and I were headed up for deer season rifle opener, and this lunch stop had become a part of the weekend tradition. Everett was absolutely destroying his Moons Over My Hammy. I nodded out the window and his eyes went wide.

""Gopher twerking!"" he exclaimed, mouth full of breakfast sandwich. 

Almost spit out my diner coffee. ""What in the actual fuck did you just say!?"" I choked, laughing.

He swallowed and took a sip of his OJ with an exasperated sigh and a satisfied pause. 

""Good for tracking.""

""Ah. Right. Yeah. Good for freezing your ass off, too."" I complained but I was happy to see it coming down already. It would be heavier further north, too. And not just good for tracking, better for spotting game against. Quieter movement, too. A bed of snow is like a layer of soundproofing on the forest floor, dampening all the sounds, sucking in any breath of an echo. And the soft styrofoam squeak of snow crunching under foot is preferable to the sharp snap of a twig or rustle of dry leaves. As much as it has a reputation for violence, hunting is mostly a mastery of silence and stillness. And violence.

Just 20 minutes after pulling back onto the highway, the flurries were getting thicker. By nightfall, we were flying through hyperspace, lines of snow zipping past through the high beams. Everett even put the Star Wars Main Titles theme on Spotify and did his best Wookie cry, giving me a good laugh. That calmed my driving-backroads-through-a-blizzard nerves a bit. That and the joint he sparked helped my knuckles death-gripping the steering wheel regain some of their color. 

In addition to the unnerving road conditions, I was a little antsy driving in unknown territory. In past years Everett's cousins let us hunt on their land, but they unfortunately had to sell. So we rented a VRBO cabin on some state forest land in the same area this year. Not as swanky as the hunting lodge we were used to, but two less idiot redneck cousins to deal with all weekend. We weren't far from the cabin according to the navigation, but something was wrong with the display. 

""Hey, what's up with that?"" I pointed at the screen. The color path marking our route showed a right turn ahead, but just after that the map went blank. I pinched the screen to zoom out but the whole section of map to the east was just black, no roads or features displayed.

""Maybe it's loading?"" Ev shrugged, ""or maybe the Google cars don't do dirt roads.""

""Dirt road?""

""Yeah, remember? The guy said the last 10 or so miles are on an old gravel pit access road through the state forest."" I slowed as we approached where the navigation path showed our correct turn into oblivion. Glancing between the nav and out the windshield, I searched the edge of the beams for a break in the trees. Suddenly there was something in the road.

I slammed on the breaks. We start fishtailing. Then spinning out. Fuck fuck fuck. 

""FUCK!"" I lent my vocal chords to the voice screaming in my head. I looked to Everett who has one hand on the above Oh-Shit handle, the other outstretched, fumbling at his feet for the joint he dropped. For a split second I thought I saw something behind him outside the passenger window. Two floating orbs of light. No. Eyes. But so big and set so far apart they couldn't have possibly been human eyes. Plus, whatever was out there would have to be attached to the car spinning like a top down the road with us. I snapped out of it.

THUNK. The car slid abruptly to a halt in a massive embankment of snow on the roadside. It hadn't been snowing that long or hard, had it? Maybe since we're further north, they've been getting winter weather longer than I'd realized. Luckily I'd already slowed enough to look for our turn that the ""crash"" had done little more than rattle our gear and our nerves a bit. Then I remembered breathing is a thing. 

""You good?"" I gasped. Everett did not need to be reminded to breathe, he was already taking a long drag from the bent joint, slumping into his seat.

""All good,"" he replied, in that pinched, holding-a-couple-lungfuls-of-weed-smoke-in sorta way. Blowing out a huge cloud of smoke, he coughed, ""Why the fuck did you brake?!""

""There was a...I thought I saw...I'm sorry man. My bad."" One fist over mouth in the throes of a nasty coughing-and-laughing jag, he gave me a few brotherly slaps on the back and an I-love-you-but-fuck-you shake of the shoulder.

We got out to survey damage, stretch legs, count blessings, etc. Apparently we'd slid to a stop right at our turn, the embankment being a pile of snow plowed from the access drive into the woods. A small metal gate propped halfway open marked the entrance of the forest road. It only took us a few minutes to get dislodged from the snow, but cost a lot of energy and dryness. Damp and dog-tired, we were ready to reach our destination and start a fire, so we got in and headed into the woods. I let Ev drive this time.

Minutes creeped by. It was hard to tell how far we'd traveled, only moving 5-10 Mph. The road seemed like something more meant for recreational all terrain vehicles, real narrow and rugged, branches scraping at the side mirrors. I was distracted and not really paying attention, looking out the window between the trees and in the rearview for any sign of the thing I'd seen in the road, or outside the Ev's window.

If I'm honest, at the time I couldn't say what it was I thought I saw. Each time I tried to conjure the image in my head, I saw something different. An animal of sorts. A deer? Or a person. Yes, a woman. In a white dress, and bright glowing eyes. No. Not eyes. Headlights. Another car coming head on. Fuck. When I tried to focus harder, the visions only got more confused. Strange combinations of these things. A chimera with hoofed feet, cloven legs, but a human female torso and arms, and six exposed breasts like utters. She had antlers, but where a face would be was just a single bright glowing light. Like the face of the guy on the poster for The Thing. But even this bizarrely specific image did not seem to trigger any actual recollection. It was as though I was simply mixing all of the excuses my brain could invent for what could have been in the road together. I couldn't shake this feeling that my brain was filling in details not because it couldn't recall what was in the road...but because it couldn't comprehend what was in the road.

""We should be seeing the cabin soon, eh?"" Everett snapped me back to reality. The navigation still showed a blue path traveling forward, surrounded by nothingness. I pinched to zoom out and saw that ahead there was a little circle marking our destination. The map scale looked like we had just over a mile to go. 

""Aha! Nice,"" Everett said, seeing the display, ""To be honest, I was kinda freaking out. Thought we'd missed it for sure, been bumping along this horse trail for like an hour.""

""Really? An hour?"" I lost time making monsters in my mind.

""At least. And there was this...tree."" I expected him to elaborate, but when he didn't I glanced over at him. 

""A tree?"" He looked a little embarrassed. Or scared. 

""...Yeah it was weird."" Everett hesitated. Unsure. Not like him. ""This kinda gnarled sickly looking oak, with scorch marks on it like it got some lightning."" I half remembered my attention snagging briefly on a tree like this on the periphery of my ghoulish visions. 

""Huh...and what about the tree?""

""...I think we passed it a few times."" Well that wouldn't make any sense.

""What do you mean?""

""I mean I've seen it four times.""

""You sure it's the same-""

""It's the same tree,"" He stammered, a little aggressive. ""Sorry, I...It's stupid. I was going to say something before because I thought for sure we were going in circles."" 

""How can it be the same tree? This road goes relatively straight, you haven't turned...""

""I know. It doesn't make sense, that's why I didn't say shit. The first time I thought, 'cool tree.' I even said 'cool tree' and tried to point it out to you, but you were staring out your window. Second time I thought, 'wtf, is that the same tree?'. But I didn't remember what the burns looked like, so chalked it up to two burned out gnarly trees. Third time, I saw the burns. This weird Y-shape. Fourth time, I saw the same burns."" He was talking rapidly now, getting elevated. I've never seen Everett like this. Excited sure, but always in a positive way. Otherwise he was always calm cool and collected, never anxious like this.

""Okay...okay. How long since you last saw it?"" 

""Right before you adjusted the navigation and we saw the cabin ahead. Shouldn't we be there by now?""

I looked back at the screen. It still showed us moving toward the destination dot, but it was hard to tell whether we'd moved any closer, with nothing around it for context. The mileage scale still showed it as just over a mile ahead. What the fuck?

""I don't know man, this thing's fucked. Maybe GPS is off?"" I tried to reassure him that we were just normal lost, not liminal-backwoods-glitch-in-the-forest lost. But I wasn't even really convincing myself. 

""Well if you see that tree again let's..."" And there it was. ""...stop.""

We sat staring out the windshield as the car idled, headlights spilling over the tree exactly as Ev had described it. Exactly as I'd seen it, too, each time before. There was something more than familiar about this tree, the Y-shaped pattern of burns up the side. I traced it's lines with my eyes like a fingertip subconsciously traces an old scar. Gently, thoughtfully, like I remember it's pain. As I stared transfixed by this tree, suddenly an image flashed so violently in my mind I had to close my eyes. 

I was back behind the wheel, glancing up from the navigation at the creature in the road. No longer sporting antlers, but gnarled oak branches growing out the sides of her head. A gruesome Y-shaped scar from her shoulders to chest, then bisecting her six teats down to her belly button. And then, it began to open. The seams of the scars slowly splitting at the middle, the flesh peeling back. Blood dripping out, then oozing out, then pouring out in torrential gushes, mixing with the snow at her feet in a most unholy carmine slurry. As the car approached in slow motion, the gaping maw of flesh and viscera in her chest opened further and further, impossibly far, spanning the entire width of the road. Slamming on the brakes, our car spun into this tunnel of gore, all at once swallowed by a deep red throbbing darkness.

I woke up vomiting out the open passenger car door. Everett was already outside the car on my side, rubbing my back while avoiding my intermittent heaves. 

""Get a little carsick, eh?"" Everett laughed and stood back to light another joint. He seemed in brighter spirits. I spat some last little chunks of my Grand Slam out and took a swig of some water to slosh around and spit again. ""Don't blame the Denny's, I stand by their quality and service. Fine dining establishment."" Okay his spirits seemed a little too fucking bright.

""I don't get carsick,"" I replied. He looked at the puddle of sick at my feet then back at me and winked.

""No worries bud. Anyways, your little spasms have a knack of keeping us on course. Check it out."" He pointed at the base of the gnarled oak tree in the headlights. Sticking out of some hedge and brush was a rusted out old mailbox. Beyond that, a narrow drive lead up to a small cabin, barely visibly in the dark save for a little headlight glinting off it's windows.

Still reeling a bit, my lazy gaze fell back down the drive to the gnarled oak tree. The Y-shaped burns on the trunk...were gone.

""The tree..."" I slurred. Everett glanced nonchalantly up at it's canopy, a few dead leaves still clinging to branches here and there.

""Yeah. Cool tree. Decent climbing if you can get up to that first big branch."" What was he talking about?

""No, I mean, what happened to the burns?"" He looked at me confused. ""You said it was the same tree you saw before? The cool tree, with the Y-shape burns. Like it got hit by lightning. Is this the same tree?"" I was beginning to feel a little crazy. The way his goofy, ready-for-tree-climbing-in-the-dark smile melted into a look of genuine concern did not help this feeling.

""Lightning burns? I don't- I mean I think it's a cool tree, but I didn't say anything about it til you pointed it out just now. I've never seen this tree before. What's going on, dude?""

I finally stood up and walked over, examining the trunk further. We'd been parked right where the car was parked. Both staring up through the windshield at this tree. He'd sounded so anxious talking about it, more than just nervous about being lost or going in circles. More like there was something about the tree itself that scared him. Or the burns. Had he seen the same gut wrenching vision of the woman in the road with the scars? Why was he acting so fucking chill now all of a sudden? Like he didn't remember the tree? 

I reached up to where the bottom of the Y-shape burn would have begun on the twisted, bulbous trunk. Had there been some trick of the light to cast a Y-shape shadow? Did the grooves of the bark create the illusion of a seam? I realized Ev was just standing behind me, looking increasingly worried.

""Okay,"" I said, ""Just tell me what you remember about driving down this access road after we spun out.""

He cocked an eyebrow and shrugged, ""I mean, not much to remember. We were bumpin along this skinny ass horse trail for 20 minutes or so, listening to tunes. You were staring out the window then all of a sudden you opened the door and started spewing your guts out. I pulled to a stop and let ya yack it out. Now we're here.""

""And you've never seen this tree before.""

""Nope.""

What the fuck. Did I hallucinate an entire conversation? Or had Everett somehow forgot? And what about the fever dream with the thing in the road? My mind was beginning to really swim. Luckily, just then a slight creaking noise from the direction of the cabin snapped me back to reality.

""Was that the door to our cabin?"" I asked. 

Everett stared back blankly. He took a step towards me.

Another noise from the drive. Crunching footsteps, soft but audible. Getting closer. My rifle was packed away in the trunk, in a locked case. Not enough time to get it out and load it.

Everett stepped to my side and I glanced up at him, seeing an impish grin creep over his face. 

""There's something I did forget to tell you, though."" He smiled and took another hit of his joint, passing it to me. I looked down at it. Had he laced it with something? To give me these visions? Why would my oldest friend fuck with me like this? What was he planning? The footsteps crunching on the snow were growing louder. It sounded like more than one person, too. Or something big.

""What?"" I asked. The hedge near the mailbox rustled and two large, dark figures stepped out. Suddenly something was hurling rapidly through the air right at my head. I threw both my hands up and something cold and metallic struck them and bounced to the ground. Everett reached down to pick up our attackers projectile, I'd assumed to throw it back. Then I saw he was still grinning, and I looked at what he held in his hands. 

I would recognize the classic lettering and pin-up girl anywhere. Old Milwaukee Beer, Since 1849. Everett cracked it open and foam erupted out the top, spilling over the sides. 

""Heads up, pussy!"" came a voice from the hedge. Stepping out from the shadows and tossing another cold beer my way was Everett's cousin Tommy followed by his younger brother Jay. 

Everett took a deep swig of beer foam and laughed, ""I invited the idiots.""

I just started investing it!,"So long story not so short. I've always been overweight. I've tried every diet you can think of. Vegan, vegetarian, Paleo, no carbs, etc. I've counted all the calories and lost weight but then just put it on again because I being in a constant deficit just made me want to binge more in anticipation.

This year I really wanted to get control of my weight, and I finally figured out it wasn't what I was eating. But more so when and how much I was eating.

By constantly talking to thin people about their diet, even eating cheeseburgers and cake, etc. They just didn't have a big appetite. They didn't have this 24/7 nagging voice telling them to eat and that they were hungry. They never binged because their body simply told them not to.

This is when I realised I'm actually a binge eater and the only way to remove temptation was to get rid of all my food and not store any in the van (I live in a van)

Unfortunately, this now led to eating out 24/7.

I would eat 2-3 times a day at specific times (much like you have a sleep schedule, I had a food schedule)

I wouldn't count my food but I would make sure it was just a sensible portion and remind myself to not eat binge food. If I did count it was to make sure I wasn't in a surplus, not so much that I was in a deficit.

This was a huge change and really helped cement that I have always just been eating too much food, healthy or not.

Unfortunately this also led to eating out constantly so I wouldn't have to think about portion sizes, my fridge using my batteries, etc.

In my head by not paying rent I would be saving so much I could splurge on groceries (NOT true unfortunately)

Taking all this new learned information about my diet I then started to buy groceries again... issue is as someone who lives in a van with ADHD tendencies (not self diagnosing but im pre cray is all im saying) the fact I no longer got the adrenaline rush of buying dinner was really depressing. Until I realised I could turn it into a game of saving!

Now, every time I dont buy out, coffee, lunch, dinner etc, I simply put the offset cost of what I WOULDVE brought into my superannuation (not my savings because I will just transfer it out again lol, I know me too well)

Its only been a couple of days but I've already put in $100 in my super lol.

Today would usually be a coffee and small bite size piece of cake (around 5-600 cals and $15)

Because I have so much money in my account I simply couldn't see it disappearing so I didn't care. But by actively thinking about investing that $15 it makes all the difference. I made the coffee at home and had a couple of wheatbix instead. Transferred $15 straight into my super and saved a couple of hundred cals. It feels like a game and so rewarding as it's money I wouldn't have anyways.

So if anyone else is really struggling with quiting takeaway, etc. try this approach and maybe it will help. (Obviously treat yourself once in awhile, life is too short)

Blade: Gillette Nacet (1)

Soap: Barrister and Mann Leviathan

Brush: Omega 80067 boar

Post-shave: Brut


Wonderful shave. 

The boar brush is great. It‚Äôs pretty well broken in, holds lather decently and is ultra soft when wet. If a cheap Omega boar is like this, I can‚Äôt wait to find out what Semogue‚Äôs 830 is like. üòÅ

I decided to go back to the tub and reload the brush for a third pass and touchup because I was using the R6 plate, and I didn‚Äôt want to have lack of lather, especially on my neck where I‚Äôm the most sensitive, have the most course hair and have very awkward growth pattern. I ultimately got a weeper on the mustache area some minor irritation on the neck, mostly because I think the R6 plate is just a tad too aggressive, despite having a very smooth, sharp, fresh Nacet inside the Rockwell. 

Still, got a perfect BBS, just the way I always aim for. ",5,1742972310.0,wicked_edge,0,0.86,False

Don‚Äôt complicate

Find living beyond despair

Dear friend, we‚Äôre lost

Our bones exhaust

Our fears stifle stuffed air

Kitchen table, yellow cake mix

Coffee tin of crayola 

smell the dust of the pencil sharpener

Two days early, surprise

Dad is home, gold

Stay this time for more

Grans chair, Christmas ham

Shitters full, my wife

Torn lost apart again son

My death is my art

Your anger lifts truth

We‚Äôre felt and seen

Panic on the stream

The waves to face

My tension erased

End it

Bring me to my rest

Eternal dust, our fears we must, you can and you will keep going

The stimulants seem to get rid of my usual anxiety, but sometimes replace it with that jittery, had too much coffee type of anxiety.

While I do feel like I have some physiological anxiety symptoms, I have a feeling a lot of it is also me getting kinda stuck on the anxiety and making it worse. So I think if I could stop doing that, the anxiety would be way more manageable.

I understand that if all goes well, the anxiety should naturally decrease the longer I'm on the meds, but I'm wondering for now, whether anyone has any tips on basically thinking myself out of the anxiety? üòÖ or really anything that could help

1jk5r53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1jk5r53/under_his_skin_novel_paige_and_jaxon/,Under his skin novel paige and jaxon,"The room feels like it‚Äôs closing in, heavy with the stench of stale smoke and the sharp tang of tension. Six men sit around the long, scarred table, each one a coiled spring ready to snap. Three from the Crimson Circle, three from Los Sangrientos‚Äî one of the gangs that‚Äôs had a stranglehold on the south side of Alderstone for as long as I can remember.

And me, caught in the middle, the only thing standing between two ticking bombs.

The leader of Los Sangrientos, Raul Martinez, leans forward, his voice a low, venomous growl as he spits out a string of words I know all too well. He wants Crimson Circle blood in exchange for his hostage, a captured Crimson soldier. But he wants more than just an even trade. He wants revenge, payment, power. His hand twitches toward his gun as he speaks, a barely contained threat.

Across from him sits my father, his face calm, expression as hard as stone. He doesn‚Äôt bend. He never does. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here, in this dim, suffocating backroom on Alderstone‚Äôs south side, trying to find a ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù solution before someone ends up dead. But every word out of Raul‚Äôs mouth chips away at that thin thread of restraint holding them all in place.

I feel my pulse hammering in my throat as the shouting escalates, their voices filling the room with promises of violence. Both sides are armed, fingers twitching, muscles tense. I know this moment well‚Äîthe sharp edge right before all hell breaks loose. And I know what happens if I don‚Äôt act.

I take a breath, locking my mask of indifference into place as I step forward, my voice cutting through the noise. ‚ÄúRaul,‚Äù I say, my Spanish clear and calm, despite the way my stomach knots with fear. ‚ÄúYou know what will happen if you pull a gun in this room. No one leaves here alive. Is that what you really want?‚Äù

His dark eyes flick to me, his expression hardening. He doesn‚Äôt like me speaking out of turn, much less challenging him. But he listens. He has to.

‚ÄúTell your father that respect has to be earned,‚Äù he snaps, voice laced with contempt.

I turn to my father, translating every word, each syllable carefully neutral. ‚ÄúRaul wants assurance,‚Äù I say, even though I know my father has no intention of giving him any. ‚ÄúIf we return his man, he expects there to be no further‚Ä¶ consequences.‚Äù

My father‚Äôs eyes meet mine, and in his gaze, I see his trust‚Äîand his expectations. It‚Äôs on me to keep this from erupting into bloodshed. And I know the weight of failure here; if things go wrong, I‚Äôll be the one they blame. Just like always.

I take a deep breath and continue, mediating each threat, every demand, back and forth, smoothing out the jagged edges with calm diplomacy. I find a narrow path through the anger, crafting a compromise that gives them both something, just enough to calm the rage simmering under their words.

The room goes silent, thick with the weight of my proposal. Raul glares at my father; my father glares back. But slowly, begrudgingly, they both nod, each one glancing at me with something close to respect‚Äîand maybe just a hint of resentment.

The Sangrientos men rise, casting one last dark look at the Crimson Circle before they disappear out the door, footsteps echoing down the hall. I don‚Äôt let myself relax. Not yet. I still feel their eyes on me, my father‚Äôs and the others, watching, waiting. I nod back, expression carefully controlled, the mask still perfectly in place.

Only when I‚Äôm alone in the bathroom down the hall do I let myself breathe. My legs feel weak as I lean over the sink, hands trembling, my breath coming in shallow, uneven gasps. My stomach twists, clenches, and before I can stop it, I‚Äôm throwing up, the stress finally spilling out of me in waves of nausea.

When it‚Äôs over, I stare at my reflection in the mirror, taking in my pale face, the hollow look in my eyes. I don‚Äôt recognize the girl staring back‚Äîthe girl who keeps putting on this show, pretending to be strong, pretending she‚Äôs cut out for this life.

I grip the edge of the sink, my knuckles white, and force myself to breathe. There‚Äôs no way out of this. No escape for the Crimson Circle‚Äôs translator, the girl who speaks every language but has nowhere left to run.

I wipe my mouth, steady my breathing, and fix the mask back in place.

When I step outside, the sharp night air hits my face, cold and bracing after the suffocating heat of the meeting room. I walk toward the waiting black car, its tinted windows hiding the figure inside. As I open the door and slide into the backseat, I feel my father‚Äôs gaze settle on me, heavy and assessing.

He sits beside me, his face unreadable, dark eyes reflecting the faint glow of streetlights flashing past the window. ‚ÄúYou did well,‚Äù he says, voice measured. But I know better than to relax at his praise; there‚Äôs always a ‚Äúbut‚Äù with him. ‚ÄúBut next time, don‚Äôt let them drag it out. You cost us time, Paige. Precious time. They should have been agreeing to terms within ten minutes.‚Äù

The reprimand slices into me, cold and cutting, but I swallow down the urge to argue. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I say softly, my tone obedient, just the way he expects it. But the truth sticks bitter in my throat‚ÄîI‚Äôm not sorry at all. I hate these meetings, these power games that I‚Äôm forced to play. It‚Äôs all my father‚Äôs doing, shaping me into the tool he needs, a pawn to smooth over his brutal business with charm and soft words.

I turn to look out the window, watching Alderstone pass by in a blur of neon lights and shadowed alleys. The people on the sidewalks are wrapped up in their own lives, oblivious to the darkness simmering under the surface of this city. They‚Äôre lucky, I think. So blissfully unaware.

As the car slows at a red light, I force myself to ask, ‚ÄúCan you drop me off here?‚Äù I don‚Äôt add that I need space to breathe, that every second in this car with him is suffocating me.

My father nods, a flicker of impatience on his face. ‚ÄúFine. Take Jacob with you.‚Äù He jerks his chin toward the front seat, where one of his guards is already watching me in the rearview mirror, waiting for orders. There‚Äôs no escaping his protection‚Äînot in this life.

The car pulls over, and I step out, Jacob trailing behind me at a respectful distance as I walk down the street. My feet carry me to a small coffee shop tucked between buildings, warm light spilling from its windows. I push open the door, the smell of coffee and pastries flooding my senses, grounding me. This place feels safe, insulated, miles away from the dark world I‚Äôm forced to live in.

I order a coffee and take it to a seat by the window, settling in as I watch the people of Alderstone go about their lives. Couples holding hands, parents tugging along kids, friends laughing as they pass by. They‚Äôre all so normal. So oblivious. They don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to carry the weight of their family‚Äôs sins, to be chained to a life they never chose.

I sip my coffee, feeling the warmth spread through me, and let myself dream‚Äîjust for a moment‚Äîthat I could be one of them. That I could live a life free from shadows, free from secrets, free from this mask that‚Äôs become part of me.

But even in my fantasies, where I let myself pretend‚Äîjust for a fleeting, stolen moment‚Äîthat I am someone else, someone free, unburdened, untouched by the past that clings to me like a shadow, I can still feel the weight of Jacob‚Äôs gaze pressing into me from across the caf√©. It‚Äôs heavy, unrelenting, like an anchor tethering me to a reality I can‚Äôt escape, a silent reminder that no matter how far I let my mind wander, how much I dream of a life that is not mine, I will always be bound to this one. And in that suffocating certainty, I realize the harshest truth of all‚Äîthere will never be a version of me that exists without him, without this, without the chains of expectation and the walls of a world I never chose.",1,1742971892.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Once seen as just a gaming gadget, VR is now being used in mental health treatment‚Äîhelping with everything from phobias to workplace burnout. Here‚Äôs how VR can help with anxiety, including¬†**stress management for professionals**, and how you can try it yourself.

# 1. VR for Relaxation & Mindfulness

Chronic stress and overthinking fuel anxiety, but VR provides an¬†**immersive escape**¬†into calming environments. Apps like:

* **Cognihab Mindfulness**¬†‚Äì Combines breathing exercises with serene visuals like jungle walk 

**Why it works for professionals:**

* A quick¬†**5-10 minute VR meditation**¬†between meetings can lower cortisol levels.
* Helps¬†**detach from work stress**¬†more effectively than just closing your eyes.

# 2. Exposure Therapy in a Safe, Controlled Way

A proven treatment for phobias (fear of public speaking, flying, etc.) is¬†**exposure therapy**‚Äîbut real-life exposure isn‚Äôt always practical.

VR solves this with:

* **Psious & XRHealth**¬†‚Äì Used by therapists to simulate anxiety triggers (e.g., crowded rooms, heights).
